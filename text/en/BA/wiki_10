<text>Thomas Baptist Morello (born May 30, 1964) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, and political activist. He is known for his tenure with the rock bands Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave. Between 2016 and 2019, Morello was a member of the supergroup Prophets of Rage. Morello was also a touring musician with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Under the moniker the Nightwatchman, Morello released his solo work. Together with Boots Riley, he formed Street Sweeper Social Club. Morello co-founded Axis of Justice, which airs a monthly program on Pacifica Radio station KPFK (90.7 FM) in Los Angeles.

Born in Harlem, New York, and raised in Libertyville, Illinois, Morello became interested in music and politics while in high school. He attended Harvard University and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies. After his previous band Lock Up disbanded, Morello met Zack de la Rocha. The two founded Rage Against the Machine, going on to become one of the most popular and influential metal acts of the 1990s.

He is best known for his unique and creative guitar playing style, which incorporates feedback noise, unconventional picking, and tapping, as well as heavy use of guitar effects. Morello is known for his socialist political views and activism; creating the Nightwatchman offered an outlet for his views while playing apolitical music with Audioslave. He was ranked number 18 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of greatest guitarists of all time. As a member of Rage Against the Machine, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Early life==
Thomas Baptist Morello was born on May 30, 1964, in Harlem, New York, to parents Ngethe Njoroge and Mary Morello. Morello, an only child, is the son of an American mother of Italian and Irish descent and a Kenyan Kikuyu father. His mother was a schoolteacher from Marseilles, Illinois, who earned a Master of Arts at Loyola University, Chicago and traveled to Germany, Spain, Japan, and Kenya as an English language teacher between 1977 and 1983.

Morello&#x27;s father participated in the Mau Mau Uprising (1952–1960) and was Kenya&#x27;s first ambassador to the United Nations. Morello&#x27;s paternal great-uncle, Jomo Kenyatta, was the first elected president of Kenya. His aunt, Jemimah Gecaga, was the first woman to serve in the legislature of Kenya; and his uncle Njoroge Mungai was a Kenyan Cabinet Minister, Member of Parliament, and was considered one of the founding fathers of modern Kenya. Morello&#x27;s parents met in August 1963 while attending a pro-democracy protest in Nairobi, Kenya. After discovering her pregnancy, Mary Morello returned to the United States with Njoroge in November, and they married in New York City.

Denying paternity of his son, Njoroge returned to his native Kenya when Morello was 16 months old. Morello was raised by his mother in Libertyville, Illinois, and attended Libertyville High School, where his mother taught American history.

Morello developed left-leaning political proclivities early, following in his mother&#x27;s footsteps. He described himself as having been &quot;the only anarchist in a conservative high school&quot;, and has since identified as a nonsectarian socialist. In the 1980 mock elections at Libertyville, he campaigned for a fictitious anarchist &quot;candidate&quot; named Hubie Maxwell, who came in fourth place in the election. He wrote a piece headlined &quot;South Africa: Racist Fascism That We Support&quot; for the school alternative newspaper, &quot;The Student Pulse&quot;.

Morello graduated from high school with honors in June 1982 and enrolled at Harvard University as a political science student that autumn. His band Bored of Education won the Ivy League Battle of the Bands in 1986 with Carolyn Bertozzi, a laureate of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, on keyboards. Morello graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in social studies. He moved to Los Angeles, where he supported himself, first by working as an exotic dancer:When I graduated from Harvard and moved to Hollywood, I was unemployable. I was literally starving, so I had to work menial labor and, at one point, I even worked as an exotic dancer. &#x27;Brick House&#x27; (by the Commodores) was my jam! I did bachelorette parties and I&#x27;d go down to my boxer shorts. Would I go further? All I can say is thank God it was in the time before YouTube! You could make decent money doing that job – people do what they have to do. Adam Jones, a high school classmate, moved to Los Angeles as well; Morello introduced Jones and Maynard James Keenan to Danny Carey, who would come to form the band Tool.

From 1987 to 1988, Morello worked in the office of U.S. Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA); however, this proved to be a negative experience for Morello, who decided never to pursue a career in politics:I never had any real desire to work in politics but if there was any ember burning in me, it was extinguished working in that job because of two things: one of them was the fact that 80 percent of the time I spent with the Senator, he was on the phone asking rich people for money. It just made me understand that the whole business was dirty. He had to compromise his entire being every day. The other was the time a woman phoned up to the office and wanted to complain that there were Mexicans moving into her neighborhood. I said to her, &#x27;Ma&#x27;am, you&#x27;re a damn racist&#x27;, and she was indignant. I thought I was representing our cause well, but I got yelled at for a week by everyone for saying that! I thought to myself that if I&#x27;m in a job where I can&#x27;t call a damn racist a damn racist, then it&#x27;s not for me.

== Musical influences ==
At age 13, Morello joined his first band, a cover band called Nebula, as the lead singer; Nebula covered material by bands including Led Zeppelin, Steve Miller Band, and Bachman–Turner Overdrive. In this same year, Morello purchased his first guitar. Around 1982, he started studying the guitar seriously. He had formed a band the same year called the Electric Sheep, featuring future Tool guitarist Adam Jones on bass. Morello wrote original material for the band that included politically-charged lyrics. Tom has cited Randy Rhoads as an influence when giving a speech at Randy&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, stating that he had a poster of the guitarist on his wall. Morello has said that he was profoundly influenced by Run-D.M.C, and Jam Master Jay in particular. 

At the time, Morello&#x27;s musical tastes lay in the direction of hard rock and heavy metal, particularly Kiss and Iron Maiden. As he stated in &quot;Flight 666&quot;, he is a huge fan of &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;, Alice Cooper, Led Zeppelin, Rush, and Black Sabbath. In an interview with MTV he said Black Sabbath &quot;set the standard for all heavy bands to come&quot;. He cited Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi as one of his biggest influences as a riff writer. Morello developed his own unique sound through the electric guitar. Later, his musical style and politics were greatly influenced by punk rock bands like the Clash, the Sex Pistols, and Devo, and artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan. On Queen he said, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the few bands in the history of rock music that was actually best in a stadium. And I miss Freddie Mercury very much.&quot;

==Recording career==
===Lock Up (1987–1990)===
In the mid 1980s, Morello joined the band Lock Up, for which he played guitar. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Something Bitchin&#x27; This Way Comes&quot;, was issued by major label Geffen Records in 1989. Lock Up had disbanded prior to Morello forming Rage Against the Machine.

===Rage Against the Machine (1991–2000; 2007–2011, 2019–2024)===
In 1991, Morello was looking to form a new band after Lock Up disbanded. Morello was impressed by Zack de la Rocha&#x27;s freestyle rapping and asked him to join his band. He drafted drummer Brad Wilk, whom he knew from Lock Up, where Wilk unsuccessfully auditioned for a drumming spot. The band&#x27;s lineup was completed when de la Rocha convinced his childhood friend Tim Commerford to play bass. After frequenting the Los Angeles club circuit, Rage Against the Machine signed a record deal with Epic Records in 1992. That same year, the band released their self-titled debut album. They achieved mainstream success and released three more studio albums: &quot;Evil Empire&quot; in 1996, &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Renegades&quot; in 2000.

In August 2000, in Los Angeles during the Democratic National Convention, Rage Against the Machine performed outside the Staples Center to a crowd numbering in the thousands while the convention took place inside. After several audience members began to throw rocks, the Los Angeles Police Department turned off the power and ordered the audience to disperse, firing rubber bullets and pepper spray into the crowd.

In late 2000, amid disagreements on the band&#x27;s direction and Commerford&#x27;s stunt at the VMAs, the disgruntled de la Rocha quit the band. On September 13, 2000, Rage Against the Machine performed their last concert, at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. Although Rage Against the Machine disbanded in October 2000, their fourth studio album, &quot;Renegades&quot;, was released two months later. 2003 saw the release of their last album, titled &quot;Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium&quot;, an edited recording of the band&#x27;s final two concerts on September 12 and 13, 2000 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. It was accompanied by an expanded DVD release of the last show and included a previously unreleased music video for &quot;Bombtrack&quot;.

After disbanding, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford went on to form Audioslave with then-former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell and released three albums and a DVD from the band&#x27;s concert in Cuba. De la Rocha started working on a solo album collaboration with DJ Shadow, Company Flow, and the Roots&#x27; Questlove, but the project was dropped in favor of working with Nine Inch Nails&#x27; Trent Reznor. Recording was completed, but the album will probably never be released. So far, only two tracks have been released: &quot;We Want It All&quot; was featured on &quot;Songs and Artists that Inspired &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Digging For Windows&quot; was released as a single.

====Reunions====

On April 29, 2007, Rage Against the Machine reunited at the Coachella Music Festival. The band played in front of an EZLN backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival. The performance was initially thought to be a one-off, but the band played seven more shows in 2007 and in January 2008 played their first shows outside the US since re-forming, as part of the Big Day Out Festival in Australia and New Zealand. In August 2008 they headlined nights at the Reading and Leeds festivals.

The band has since continued to tour around the world, headlining many large festivals in Europe and the United States, including Lollapalooza in Chicago. In 2008 the band also played shows in Denver, Colorado, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, to coincide with the Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention, respectively. In July 2011, Rage Against the Machine played at L.A. Rising, a concert formed by the band in Los Angeles, in which they headlined and played with other artists, including Muse and Rise Against.

On November 1, 2019, it was reported that Rage Against the Machine were reuniting for their first shows in nine years in spring 2020, including two appearances at that year&#x27;s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The planned summer 2020 tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rescheduled tour began in July 2022, but remaining tour dates in North America and Europe needed to be postponed after De la Rocha tore his left Achilles’ tendon. In 2024, Wilk announced that the band would no longer be touring or performing live.

===Audioslave (2001–2007, 2017)===

After de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine, the remaining bandmates began collaborating with former Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell at the suggestion of producer Rick Rubin. The new group was first rumored to be called the Civilian Project, but the name Audioslave was confirmed before their first album was released.

The band released their eponymous debut album on November 19, 2002. It was a critical and commercial success, attaining triple-platinum status.

The band released their second album, &quot;Out of Exile&quot;, on May 24, 2005. It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard charts and attained platinum status. In the same year, they released a DVD documenting their trip as the first American rock band to play a free show in Cuba. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Revelations&quot;, was released in the fall of 2006. As of February 15, 2007, Audioslave had broken up as a result of frontman Cornell&#x27;s departure due to &quot;irresolvable personality conflicts&quot;. The band reunited with Zack de la Rocha and resumed their previous band, Rage Against the Machine.

Audioslave reunited for one show in January 2017, and there were talks about a reunion tour. However, Cornell&#x27;s death on May 18, 2017, eliminated such possibility.

===The Nightwatchman (2003–present)===
Morello writes and performs folk music under the alias the Nightwatchman. He has explained:

In November 2003 the Nightwatchman joined artists Billy Bragg, Lester Chambers of the Chambers Brothers, Steve Earle, Jill Sobule, Boots Riley of the Coup and Mike Mills of R.E.M. on the Tell Us the Truth Tour. The thirteen-city tour was supported by unions, environmental and media reform groups including Common Cause, Free Press and A.F.L.-C.I.O. with the ultimate goal of &quot;informing music fans, and exposing and challenging the failures of the major media outlets in the United States.&quot; Morello explained: Media consolidation needs smashing and globalization needs unmasking. When presidents and politicians lie, it is the job of the press to expose those lies. When the press fails, the gangstas come out from hiding. The lie becomes the law. The point of the Tell Us the Truth Tour is to help others make connections, and to show them that activism can change the policies of this country.
One of his many songs, &quot;No One Left&quot;, which compares the aftermath of September 11, 2001 attacks to that of a U.S. attack on Iraq, appears on the album &quot;Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. The Nightwatchman appeared on the album/DVD &quot;Axis Of Justice: Concert Series Volume 1&quot;, contributing the songs &quot;Until the End&quot;, &quot;The Road I Must Travel&quot;, and &quot;Union Song&quot;. Morello, as the Nightwatchman, released his debut solo album, &quot;One Man Revolution&quot;, on April 24, 2007. The Nightwatchman joined the Dave Matthews Band for its European tour in May 2007. As well as opening for the Dave Matthews Band, he was invited to guest on a couple of songs each night. The last night of this Morello/Dave Matthews Band arrangement was May 30, 2007, at Wembley Arena in London, on Morello&#x27;s birthday. The Nightwatchman supported Ben Harper on tour. During this tour, Morello joined Harper onstage for a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Masters of War&quot;, on which he plays the electric guitar in the style for which he is best known.

Morello has presided over a Hotel Café residency in L.A. since November 2007, which has featured many of his musical cohorts, including Serj Tankian, Perry Farrell, Jon Foreman of Switchfoot, Shooter Jennings, Nuno Bettencourt, Sen Dog of Cypress Hill, Jill Sobule, Boots Riley, Alexi Murdoch, Wayne Kramer of MC5 and others. On October 10, 2008, the Nightwatchman appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; as a musical guest, promoting his new album &quot;The Fabled City&quot;. On December 17, 2011, Morello performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host Nic Harcourt. Morello, as the Nightwatchman, contributed a version of &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; on the &quot;Chimes Of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International&quot; tribute album released in 2012.

On February 2, 2019, Morello made a guest appearance at the Foo Fighters pre-Super Bowl 53 concert in Atlanta, along with Zac Brown, for a cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;War Pigs&quot;.

=== Street Sweeper Social Club (2006–present) ===

Following Audioslave&#x27;s breakup in 2007, Morello met up with Boots Riley of the Coup, suggesting that they start a band which Morello had named Street Sweeper. After giving Riley a tape of various songs to write to, the two created the duo Street Sweeper Social Club.

=== Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (2008–2015) ===
In April 2008, Morello made two guest appearances with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at the Honda Center in Anaheim. They performed an extended electric version, featuring guitar solos, of &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; (which had previously been covered by Rage Against the Machine on &quot;Renegades&quot;). One of these performances was included on Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Magic Tour Highlights&quot; EP as an audio track or video download. On October 29, 2009, Morello performed at the 25th Anniversary Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Concert at Madison Square Garden. He performed &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;, &quot;London Calling&quot;, &quot;Badlands&quot;, and &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot; with Springsteen and the E Street Band.

Morello appears on two songs on Springsteen&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;. He joined Springsteen, the E Street Band, and the Roots on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; to preview the album prior to its release. On December 4, 2012, Morello again joined Springsteen and the E Street Band for five songs during a concert in Anaheim. On January 17, 2013, it was announced that Morello would temporarily join Springsteen and the E Street Band on the March 2013 Australian leg of their &quot;Wrecking Ball Tour&quot;, filling in for longtime E Street Band guitarist Steve Van Zandt, who had scheduling conflicts filming the TV series &quot;Lilyhammer&quot;. During the tour, Morello joined the band in the studio to record new music.

The material Morello recorded with Springsteen appeared on Springsteen&#x27;s 18th studio album, &quot;High Hopes&quot;, which was released in January 2014. Morello appears on eight of the album&#x27;s 11 tracks and shares lead vocals with Springsteen on a re-recording of &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;. It was Morello who originally suggested that Springsteen perform &quot;High Hopes&quot; during a concert for the first time in March 2013. Springsteen had previously recorded &quot;High Hopes&quot; in 1995, and the 2013 performance led to its re-recording, which subsequently developed into the album of the same name. Springsteen heavily credits Morello as being a major inspiration for the album by saying he was &quot;my muse&quot; and &quot;he pushed the rest of this project to another level&quot;. Morello subsequently appeared alongside Springsteen and the E Street Band during a January 2014 appearance on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and then on the ensuing &quot;High Hopes Tour&quot; which came to an end in May 2014. Springsteen&#x27;s subsequent &quot;The River Tour 2016&quot; featured a smaller lineup without Morello.

Morello made a surprise appearance during Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s &quot;The River Tour 2016&quot; show on August 25, 2016, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, where he joined them on &quot;Death to My Hometown&quot;, &quot;American Skin (41 Shots)&quot;, &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; and &quot;Badlands&quot;.

=== Prophets of Rage (2016–2019) ===
Prophets of Rage formed in 2016. The supergroup consists of Morello, Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, and drummer Brad Wilk, with Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D and DJ Lord and Cypress Hill&#x27;s B-Real. Morello declared to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;re an elite task force of revolutionary musicians determined to confront this mountain of election year bullshit, and confront it head-on with Marshall stacks blazing.&quot;

The band&#x27;s name derives from the title of the Public Enemy song &quot;Prophets of Rage&quot; from their 1988 album &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot;. To coincide with their protest performance at the Republican National Convention, the band released their debut single, entitled &quot;Prophets of Rage&quot;. The group released the EP, &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; in 2016, and the LP &quot;Prophets of Rage&quot; in 2017. The band began their &quot;Make America Rage Again&quot; tour of North America during the summer of 2016 and continued to tour through 2018. With the announcement of the 2020 reunion of Rage Against the Machine, Prophets of Rage disbanded.

=== &quot;The Atlas Underground&quot; (2018) ===

On July 26, Morello announced a new solo album titled &quot;The Atlas Underground&quot; featuring collaborations with Marcus Mumford, Portugal. The Man, Bassnectar, the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s RZA and GZA, Vic Mensa, K.Flay, Big Boi, Gary Clark Jr., Pretty Lights, Killer Mike, Tim McIlrath, Steve Aoki and Whethan. The first songs released from the album are &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need You&quot; featuring Vic Mensa and &quot;Battle Sirens&quot; featuring Knife Party. &quot;The Atlas Underground&quot; was released on October 12, 2018.

=== &quot;The Atlas Underground Fire&quot; (2021) ===
On September 21, 2021, Morello released a new song called &quot;Let&#x27;s Get The Party Started&quot; featuring members of Bring Me the Horizon. He followed this with the October 15, 2021, release of his second solo album, &quot;The Atlas Underground Fire&quot;.

===Other side projects (1992–present)===
In 1992, Morello collaborated with hip-hop group Run-DMC on the song &quot;Big Willie&quot;, which later appeared on their 1993 album, &quot;Down with the King&quot;. Morello and Rage Against the Machine bandmate Brad Wilk joined with Maynard James Keenan of Tool and Billy Gould of Faith No More to record the song &quot;Calling Dr. Love&quot; for the 1994 Kiss tribute album &quot;Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved&quot;. The lineup was billed as Shandi&#x27;s Addiction. Morello played lead guitar and produced on three tracks of Primus&#x27; 1999 studio album &quot;Antipop&quot;. Morello played the guitar on &quot;The Faculty&quot; soundtrack, featured with Class of &#x27;99 for their cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (pt. 2)&quot;. Morello recorded guitars along with Johnny Cash during his late career with American Recordings, which was released on &quot;Unearthed&quot;. Morello was the executive producer of Anti-Flag&#x27;s 2003 studio album &quot;The Terror State&quot;. Morello played a short solo on the Benny Mason band song &quot;Exodus IV&quot;.

As the Nightwatchman, Morello has often performed alongside Boots Riley, frontman of the Coup; he produced and performed on a track for the Coup&#x27;s 2006 release &quot;Pick a Bigger Weapon&quot;. In July 2006, it was reported that Morello and Riley were to collaborate on a project called Street Sweepers. Morello appears in &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; as a &quot;guitar boss&quot; (the first of three in the career mode of the game) in a night club. Beating him in a one-on-one battle (playing an original composition he recorded for the game) will unlock him as a playable character and will result in the player and Morello playing the master track of &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; as an encore immediately following the battle. Morello&#x27;s original composition features many of his trademark guitar effects like those heard in songs such as Audioslave&#x27;s &quot;Cochise&quot; and &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Remind Me&quot; and Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; and &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot;.

In April 2006, Morello produced two tracks for the group Outernational; on the band&#x27;s website, it states that Morello will be producing their debut album. In 2007, Morello was a featured guitarist in the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; soundtrack, playing guitar for the Armory stage&#x27;s battle music. On February 23, 2010, Cypress Hill released the second single, &quot;Rise Up&quot;, from their album &quot;Rise Up&quot; featuring Morello on guitar. He is featured on the track &quot;Shut &#x27;Em Down&quot; from the same album. Unlike &quot;Rise Up&quot;, which is very similar in style to Morello&#x27;s rap metal band Rage Against the Machine, it contains strong Latin and rapcore influences. On November 2, 2010, Travis Barker and Morello released a song alongside RZA and Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan called &quot;Carry It&quot;. It would later appear on Travis&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Give the Drummer Some&quot;.

He is collaborating with David Rovics&#x27; latest album. Morello was featured in the song &quot;Opinion&quot; in the eponymous debut album by Device, which was released in April 2013. Morello is featured on Linkin Park&#x27;s album &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; on the song &quot;Drawbar&quot;, released on June 17, 2014.

In March 2016, Morello appeared with Knife Party and Pendulum as a guest at Ultra Music Festival Miami. Songs played featuring Morello&#x27;s guitar work included &quot;Battle Sirens&quot; from his upcoming album &quot;The Atlas Underground&quot; and a mashup of the two co-headliners entitled &quot;Pendulum VS Knife Party – Tarantula VS Bonfire.&quot; Morello, along with Michael Moore and others involved in the film industry, is a board member of the Traverse City Film Festival, an annual event that takes place at the end of July, in Traverse City, Michigan.

On February 24, 2019, Morello appeared as a presenter at the 91st Academy Awards.

In February 2021, Morello was featured on The Pretty Reckless song &quot;And So It Went&quot; on their album &quot;Death by Rock and Roll&quot;. In April 2021, Morello released a new song and music video with Pussy Riot, &quot;Weather Strike&quot;. He has hosted his own weekly show, One Man Revolution, on the Lithium channel at SiriusXM. He joined an additional weekly show March 2, 2021, and an original podcast March 3, 2021.

He was a participant for the &quot;Live for Gaza&quot; online-event which was in April 2021. It featured Gaza&#x27;s first Rock Band, Osprey V and other Gaza artists, Wafaa Alnjeili, and Badeel Band.

On January 13, 2023, Morello was featured on Måneskin&#x27;s single and music video for &quot;Gossip&quot;. On August 18, 2023, Morello was featured on Babymetal&#x27;s single and music video for &quot;Metali&quot;.

==Appearances in films==
Morello has appeared as himself in an array of documentary films; such as &quot;Sounds Like a Revolution&quot;, &quot;Iron Maiden: Flight 666&quot;, about heavy metal band Iron Maiden&#x27;s Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and in &quot;Chevolution&quot;, an exposé about the &quot;Guerrillero Heroico&quot; photo of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. In addition, Morello was cast as a terrorist in &quot;Iron Man&quot;, an uncredited Son&#x27;a officer in &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; and later did a cameo in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Good Shepherd&quot;, and appeared in the film &quot;Made&quot;.

==Writing==
In 2011, it was announced that Morello, a lifelong comic book fan, would write a new 12-issue comic book series for Dark Horse Comics, entitled &quot;Orchid&quot;. The series is a post-apocalyptic story in which the title character is &quot;a teenage prostitute who learns that she is more than the role society has imposed upon her.&quot; The first issue was published in October 2011, and Morello released an exclusive new song to accompany each issue. &quot;Orchid&quot; is illustrated by Canadian artist Scott Hepburn. The series was collected into three trade paperback volumes released in 2012 and 2013.

The release party sponsored by Dark Horse was held at Jetpack Comics in Rochester, New Hampshire, on October 12, 2011.

Morello contributed a written introduction to the 2016 edition of &quot;The Big Red Songbook&quot;, a compendium of wobbly protest music.

In 2021, Morello started publishing a regular newsletter in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Guitar playing technique==
Morello is famed for his guitar style, which consists of heavy metal/punk hybrid riffs and hip hop-inspired sounds. A 1993 &quot;Melody Maker&quot; live review of a Rage Against the Machine gig said, &quot;Guitarist Tom Morello wears his guitar high up to wring every sound out of it. Falling bombs, police sirens, scratching – he can do them all.&quot;

In the studio, Morello uses the same setup for the bulk of the guitar tracks. For &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot;, he used a few other amplifiers, such as a Line 6 as heard on the clean, spacey intro of &quot;Mic Check&quot;, plus a Pignose mini-amplifier and a MusicMan &quot;Twin&quot; style amplifier. During the recording of Audioslave&#x27;s last album, &quot;Revelations&quot;, Morello experimented with different amplifier setups. For the title track&#x27;s solo he split his signal to his standard Marshall 2205 head and Peavey cabinet and a 100 watt Fender Bassman head and an Orange cabinet. With delay sent to one while the other is unaffected the sound is being &quot;ping-ponged&quot; between the two amplifiers. He also borrowed a Vox AC30 amplifier from producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien for some tracks.

Morello was voted the fifth greatest guitarist of the past 30 years in a 2010 BBC poll.

==Equipment==
Morello uses heavily modified guitars from various manufacturers, with each guitar having different slogans written on them that was inspired by Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Machine Kills Fascists&quot; guitar. He has played the same Marshall JCM800 amplifier since the late &#x27;80s, and has used the same amp settings since choosing them in 1988 or &#x27;89.

In 2023, Neural DSP released an official signature audio plug-in based on Morello&#x27;s gear.

==Politics==
===Political views===

Morello, as well as fellow members of Rage Against the Machine, holds left-wing political views. Morello in particular identifies as a socialist, and has called socialism a necessity for the world, saying &quot;I think [socialism is] a necessity, to save the planet [...] Look at how capitalism has responded to the global pandemic–it&#x27;s a disaster. Look at how capitalism has responded to the impending environmental crisis – it&#x27;s a disaster. Look at how capitalism has responded to racism and anti-immigrant sentiment in the 21st century–it&#x27;s a disaster.&quot;

Morello frequently uses communist imagery, such as hammer and sickle stickers on his guitars, and Red star hats. Following the death of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, he expressed support saying &quot;While I don&#x27;t agree with all that Fidel Castro did there is ample reason why he is vilified in the US and yet remains a huge hero throughout the Third World [...] By defying Yankee imperialism for 50 years, instituting the best healthcare, child immunization and literacy systems in the Western Hemisphere (surpassing the U.S. and Canada), exporting doctors to countries in need all over the globe [...], and being an unrepentant advocate of the poor and exploited it is no surprise that millions will mourn his passing.&quot; Regarding his childhood, Morello cites the Black Panther party, Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara and radical left militant organization Weather Underground as &quot;Very important to [him]. These were people who unapologetically stood up to injustice with the most forceful means necessary.&quot;

Rage has expressed support for guerrilla movements such as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, Shining Path as well as social and political movements such as the Brazilian Landless Workers&#x27; Movement.

In May 2021, more than 600 musicians, including members of Rage Against the Machine, added their signature to an open letter calling for a boycott of performances in Israel until Israel ends its occupation of the Palestinian territories. Morello called for a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

In 2023 he attended the 50th anniversary commemoration of the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état, saying that the United States &quot;shares responsibility&quot; for the coup.

===Activism===
Morello, with fellow members of Rage Against the Machine, protested the &quot;Parental Advisory&quot; sticker, introduced in 1987 in the U.S., on explicit albums and singles by Tipper Gore&#x27;s Parents Music Resource Center. The protest consisted of the band refusing to perform at Lollapalooza 1993: They took the stage naked, mouths covered in duct tape, and bodies painted with the organization&#x27;s abbreviation, PMRC. Instead of performing, the band allowed their instruments to feedback for 14 minutes.

Morello is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World.
 On August 27, 2008, the musician performed in Denver, Colorado in opposition to the Commission on Presidential Debates exclusion of third party candidates from the nationally televised debates at the Open the Debates rally. Morello performed &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot; as the Nightwatchman and endorsed independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader. Sean Penn, Jello Biafra, Brooke Smith and Cindy Sheehan were also part of the rally.

In October 2009, Morello, among a number of musicians, sued the U.S. federal government for the declassification of all documents relating to the use of music in interrogations at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He stated: 

During his 2008 presidential campaign, President Obama had promised to close down Guantánamo in 2009. After being elected, Obama&#x27;s attempts were largely stymied by Republican opposition in Congress. On 15 August 2016, 15 prisoners were transferred from the prison. Twelve Yemeni nationals and 3 Afghans were transferred to the United Arab Emirates, bringing the total number of prisoners to 61 with 20 more cleared for transfer. President Obama did not close the prison before leaving office but had reduced the number of prisoners to 41. On 11 February 2021, President Joe Biden announced a formal review of the camp, with a stated goal of closing it by the end of his term. At the time, there were 40 prisoners at the camp, most of whom had been held for nearly two decades without being charged or tried. As of March 2022, one prisoner, Mohammed al-Qahtani, was expatriated to Saudi Arabia, bringing the total number of prisoners to 38.

On February 21, 2011, Morello organized and performed an acoustic concert in support of the protests over collective bargaining rights in Madison, Wisconsin. The concert featured the MC5&#x27;s Wayne Kramer and Boston punk band Street Dogs. Morello wrote an article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about his experience.

Morello played at many Occupy movements, including Occupy Wall Street as well as Occupy Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, Vancouver, British Columbia, Nottingham and Newcastle, England protests. When Republican nominee for vice president in the 2012 election Paul Ryan said that he liked the music of Beethoven, Rage Against the Machine, and Led Zeppelin, Morello responded with an op-ed in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, stating, &quot;Paul Ryan&#x27;s love for Rage Against The Machine is amusing, because he is the embodiment of the machine that our music has been raging against for two decades.&quot;

In June 2013, Morello and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning.

On September 26, 2014, Morello played a benefit concert in Seattle for 15 Now, the group launched by Socialist Alternative and Kshama Sawant to raise the minimum wage to $15/hour. The concert was aimed at expanding the organization nationally. After playing the show, Morello encouraged a boycott of The 5 Point Cafe, a local diner in Seattle, which he claimed on Twitter was &quot;anti-Kenyan&quot; and &quot;anti-worker&quot;, encouraging his fans to &quot;spread the word&quot;. The restaurant&#x27;s owner, David Meinert, responded, stating that &quot;Rock stars don&#x27;t get special treatment at The 5 Point&quot;, and claiming that &quot;Tom and his crew didn&#x27;t get let in as the place was at capacity and there was a line. No one was being let in.&quot; Morello responded to Meinert, stating that he would show &quot;leniency&quot; and &quot;forgive&quot; Meinert if he embraced a $15 minimum-wage.

===Axis of Justice===
Morello and Serj Tankian of System of a Down are the co-founders of Axis of Justice, a political group whose declared purpose is &quot;to bring together musicians, fans of music, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice together.&quot; They &quot;aim to build a bridge between fans of music around the world and local political organizations to effectively organize around issues of peace, human rights, and economic justice.&quot; The group has worked for such causes as immigrant rights and death penalty abolition. Its recommended book list includes such authors as Karl Marx, Che Guevara, George Orwell, Noam Chomsky, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Grant Morrison.

Morello and Tankian, together with a handful of other artists, including Maynard James Keenan, Wayne Kramer of the MC5, the hip hop group Jurassic 5, and Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, released a live recording of covers and original songs, titled &quot;Axis of Justice: Concert Series Volume 1&quot;.

On April 6, 2006, Morello was honored with the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award for his support of worker&#x27;s rights and for his AOJ work. Morello has worked on numerous labor campaigns: the Guess sweatshop boycott, the LA janitors strike, the Taco Bell boycott, the southern California grocery workers strike &amp; lockout, and the Democratic Socialists of America&#x27;s Starbucks unionization campaign, among others.

Morello was a strong supporter of the 2006 United States immigration reform protests around the US. Morello played as the Nightwatchman at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles and has featured many articles on AOJ. On September 28, 2006, Morello was one of 400 protesters arrested protesting in support of immigrant hotel workers&#x27; rights, in what organizers called &quot;the largest act of civil disobedience in the history of Los Angeles&quot;.

==Personal life==
Morello and his wife Denise have two sons. Morello was raised Catholic and is a vegetarian. He lives in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles. Morello is a longtime fan of both the Chicago Cubs of the MLB and the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL; he named his second son Roman, after former Rams quarterback Roman Gabriel.

<text>The azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyanus) is a bird in the crow family. It is 31–35 cm long and similar in overall shape to the Eurasian magpie (&quot;Pica pica&quot;) but is more slender with proportionately smaller legs and bill. It belongs to the genus &quot;Cyanopica&quot;.

It has a glossy black top to the head and a white throat. The underparts and the back are a light grey-fawn in colour with the wings and the feathers of the long (16–20 cm) tail an azure blue. It inhabits various types of coniferous (mainly pine) and broadleaf forest, including parks and gardens in the eastern populations.

==Distribution and habitat==
It occurs over a large region of eastern Asia in China, Korea, Japan, and north into Mongolia and southern Siberia. The Iberian magpie from southwestern and central parts of the Iberian Peninsula, in Spain and Portugal was formerly thought to be conspecific, but recent genetic analysis has shown them to be distinct at species level.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Often azure-winged magpies find food as a family group or several groups making flocks of up to 70 birds. The largest groups congregate after the breeding season and throughout the winter months. Their diet consists mainly of acorns (oak seeds) and pine nuts, extensively supplemented by invertebrates and their larvae, soft fruits and berries, and also human-provided scraps in parks and towns.

This species usually nests in loose, open colonies with a single nest in each tree. There are usually 6–8 eggs that are incubated for 15 days. Azure-winged magpies that have asynchronous broods, creating a size hierarchy among nestlings, produce more eggs and fledge more nestlings than those which have synchronous broods.

The voice is a quick fired and metallic sounding &#x27; usually preceded by a single &#x27;.

<text>Dame Alice Ellen Terry (27 February 184721 July 1928) was a leading English actress of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Born into a family of actors, Terry began performing as a child, acting in Shakespeare plays in London, and toured throughout the British provinces in her teens. At 16, she married the 46-year-old artist George Frederic Watts, but they separated within a year. She soon returned to the stage but began a relationship with the architect Edward William Godwin and retired from the stage for six years. She resumed acting in 1874 and was immediately acclaimed for her portrayal of roles in Shakespeare and other classics.

In 1878 she joined Henry Irving&#x27;s company as his leading lady, and for more than the next two decades she was considered the leading Shakespearean and comic actress in Britain. Two of her most famous roles were Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. She and Irving also toured with great success in America and Britain.

In 1903 Terry took over management of London&#x27;s Imperial Theatre, focusing on the plays of George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen. The venture was a financial failure, and Terry turned to touring and lecturing. She continued to find success on stage until 1920, while also appearing in films from 1916 to 1922. Her career lasted nearly seven decades.

== Early life and career ==

Terry was born in Coventry, England, the third surviving child born into a theatrical family. Her parents, Benjamin (1818–1896), of Irish descent, and Sarah ( Ballard; 1819–1892), of Scottish ancestry, were comic actors in a Portsmouth-based touring company, (where Sarah&#x27;s father was a Wesleyan minister) and had 11 children. At least five of them became actors: Kate, Ellen, Marion, Florence, and Fred. Two other children, George and Charles, were connected with theatre management. Kate (the grandmother of Val and John Gielgud) and Marion were particularly successful on stage.

Terry made her first stage appearance at age nine, as Mamillius, opposite Charles Kean as Leontes, in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; at London&#x27;s Princess&#x27;s Theatre in 1856. She also played the roles of Puck in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1856), Prince Arthur in &quot;King John&quot; (1858), and Fleance in &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1859), continuing at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre until the Keans&#x27; retirement in 1859. During the theatre&#x27;s summer closures, Terry&#x27;s father presented drawing-room entertainments at the Royal Colosseum, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, and then on tour. In 1859, she appeared in the Tom Taylor comedy &quot;Nine Points of the Law&quot; at the Olympic Theatre. For the next two years, Terry and her sister Kate toured the British provinces in sketches and plays, accompanied by their parents and a musician.

Between 1861 and 1862, Terry was engaged by the Royalty Theatre in London, managed by Madame Albina de Rhona, where she acted with W. H. Kendal, Charles Wyndham and other rising actors. In 1862, she joined her sister Kate in J. H. Chute&#x27;s stock company at the Theatre Royal, Bristol, where she played a wide variety of parts, including burlesque roles requiring singing and dancing, as well as roles in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. In 1863, Chute opened the Theatre Royal, Bath, where 15-year-old Terry appeared at the opening as Titania in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, then returned to London to join J. B. Buckstone&#x27;s company at the Haymarket Theatre in Shakespeare roles as well as Sheridan and modern comedies.

==Watts, Godwin and return to acting==

Terry married three times and was involved in numerous relationships. In London, during her engagement at the Haymarket Theatre, she and her sister Kate had their portraits painted by the eminent artist George Frederic Watts. His famous portraits of Terry include &quot;Choosing&quot;, in which she must select between earthly vanities, symbolised by showy but scentless camellias, and nobler values symbolised by humble-looking but fragrant violets. His other famous portraits of her include &quot;Ophelia&quot; and &quot;Watchman&quot;, and, with Kate, &quot;The Sisters&quot;. He proposed marriage to Terry in spite of his being three decades her senior. She was impressed with Watts&#x27;s art and elegant lifestyle, and she wished to please her parents by making an advantageous marriage. She left the stage during the run of Tom Taylor&#x27;s hit comedy &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; at the Haymarket, in which she played Mary Meredith.

Terry and Watts married on 20 February 1864 at St Barnabas, Kensington, seven days before her 17th birthday, when Watts was 46. She was uncomfortable in the role of child bride, and Watts&#x27;s circle of admirers, including the salon organiser Sara Monckton Prinsep, were not welcoming. Terry and Watts separated after only ten months. During that short time, however, she had the opportunity to meet many cultured, talented and important people, such as poets Robert Browning and Alfred, Lord Tennyson; prime ministers William Ewart Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli; and Prinsep&#x27;s sister, the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. Because of Watts&#x27;s paintings of her and her association with him, she &quot;became a cult figure for poets and painters of the later Pre-Raphaelite and Aesthetic movements, including Oscar Wilde&quot;.

She returned to acting by 1866. In 1867, Terry performed in several Tom Taylor pieces, including &quot;A Sheep in Wolf&#x27;s Clothing&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre, &quot;The Antipodes&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and &quot;Still Waters Run Deep&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Long Acre. She would play there later that year for the first time opposite Henry Irving in the title roles of &quot;Katherine and Petruchio&quot;, David Garrick&#x27;s version of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.

In 1868, despite her parents&#x27; objection, she began a relationship with the progressive architect-designer and essayist Edward William Godwin, another man whose taste she admired, whom she had met some years before. They retreated to Pigeonwick, a house in Harpenden, where she retired from acting for six years. Terry was still married to Watts, not finalising the divorce until 1877, so she and Godwin could not marry. However, they had a daughter, Edith Craig, in 1869 and a son, Edward Gordon Craig, in 1872. The surname Craig was chosen to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy, but their cohabitation and children born out of wedlock were considered scandalous at the time.

The relationship cooled in 1874 amid Godwin&#x27;s preoccupation with his architectural practice and financial difficulties. However, even after their 1875 separation, Godwin continued to design Terry&#x27;s costumes when she returned to the stage. In 1874 Terry played in several roles in Charles Reade&#x27;s works: Philippa Chester in &quot;The Wandering Heir&quot;; Susan Merton in &quot;It&#x27;s Never Too Late to Mend&quot;; and Helen Rolleston in &quot;Our Seamen&quot;. That same year she performed at the Crystal Palace with Charles Wyndham as Volante in &quot;The Honeymoon&quot; by John Tobin and as Kate Hardcastle in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; by Oliver Goldsmith.

==Shakespeare, Irving, Lyceum==

In 1875, Terry gave an acclaimed performance as Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Theatre, produced by the Bancrofts. Oscar Wilde wrote a sonnet, upon seeing her in this role: &quot;No woman Veronese looked upon/Was half so fair as thou whom I behold.&quot; She recreated this role many times in her career until her last appearance as Portia in London in 1917.

In 1876 she appeared as Lady Teazle in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, Blanche Haye in a revival of T. W. Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Ours&quot;, and the title role in &quot;Olivia&quot; by William Gorman Wills at the Court Theatre (an adaptation of &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;), where she joined the company of John Hare. In November 1877 she married Charles Clavering Wardell (stage name Charles Kelly; 1839–1885), an actor/journalist she had met while appearing in Reade&#x27;s plays, but they separated in 1881. After this, she finally reconciled with her parents, whom she had not seen since she began to live out-of-wedlock with Godwin.

In 1878 the 30-year-old Terry joined Henry Irving&#x27;s company at the Lyceum Theatre as its leading lady at a generous salary, beginning with Ophelia opposite Irving&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Soon she was regarded as the leading Shakespearean actress in Britain, and in partnership with Irving, she reigned as such for over 20 years until they left the Lyceum in 1902. Their 1879 production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; ran for an unusual 250 nights, and success followed success in the Shakespeare canon as well as in Tennyson, Bulwer-Lytton, Reade, Sardou, and plays by other contemporary playwrights, such as W. G. Wills, and other major plays.

In 1879 &quot;The Times&quot; said of Terry&#x27;s acting in Paul Terrier&#x27;s &quot;All is Vanity, or the Cynic&#x27;s Defeat&quot;, &quot;Miss Terry&#x27;s Iris was a performance of inimitable charm, full of movement, ease, and laughter ... the most exquisite harmony and natural grace ... such an Iris might well have turned the head of Diogenes himself.&quot; In 1880, at the Lyceum, she played the title role in an adaptation of &quot;King René&#x27;s Daughter&quot; called &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. &quot;The Era&quot; wrote: &quot;Nothing more winning and enchanting than the grace, and simplicity, and girlish sweetness of the blind Iolanthe as shown by Miss Ellen Terry has within our memory been seen upon the stage. The assumption was delightfully perfect. ... Exquisite ... exercise of the peculiarly fascinating powers of Miss Ellen Terry, who achieved an undoubted triumph ... and was cheered again and again&quot;.
Among her most celebrated roles with Irving were Ophelia, Pauline in &quot;The Lady of Lyons&quot; by Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1878), Portia (1879), Queen Henrietta Maria in William Gorman Wills&#x27;s drama &quot;Charles I&quot; (1879), Desdemona in &quot;Othello&quot; (1881), Camma in Tennyson&#x27;s short tragedy &quot;The Cup&quot; (1881), Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, another of her signature roles (1882 and often thereafter), Juliet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1882), Jeanette in &quot;The Lyons Mail&quot; (1883), the title part in Reade&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Nance Oldfield&quot; (1883), Viola in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1884), Margaret in the long-running adaptation of &quot;Faust&quot; by Wills (1885), the title role in &quot;Olivia&quot; (1885, which she had played earlier at the Court Theatre), Lady Macbeth in &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1888, with incidental music by Arthur Sullivan), Queen Katherine in &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (1892), Cordelia in &quot;King Lear&quot; (1892), Rosamund de Clifford in &quot;Becket&quot; by Alfred Tennyson (1893), Guinevere in &quot;King Arthur&quot; by J. Comyns Carr, with incidental music by Sullivan (1895), Imogen in &quot;Cymbeline&quot; (1896), the title character in Victorien Sardou and Émile Moreau&#x27;s play &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; (1897) and Volumnia in &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (1901).

Terry made her American debut in 1883, playing Queen Henrietta opposite Irving in &quot;Charles I&quot;. Among the other roles she portrayed on this and six subsequent North American tours with Irving were Jeanette, Ophelia, Beatrice, Viola, and her most famous role, Portia. Her last role at the Lyceum was Portia in 1902, after which she toured in the British provinces with Irving and his company that autumn. Whether Irving&#x27;s relationship with Terry was romantic as well as professional has been the subject of much speculation. According to Sir Michael Holroyd&#x27;s book about Irving and Terry, &quot;A Strange Eventful History&quot;, after Irving&#x27;s death, Terry stated that she and Irving had been lovers and that: &quot;We were terribly in love for a while&quot;. Irving was separated, but not divorced from his wife. Terry had separated from Wardell in 1881, and Irving was godfather to both her children. They travelled on holiday together, and Irving wrote tender letters to Terry.

In London, Terry lived in Earls Court with her children and pets during the 1880s, first in Longridge Road, then Barkston Gardens in 1889, but she kept country homes. In 1900, she bought her farmhouse in Small Hythe, Kent, where she lived for the rest of her life. In 1889, her son joined the Lyceum company as an actor, appearing with the company until 1897, when he retired from the stage to study drawing and produce woodblock engravings. Her daughter Edith also played at the Lyceum for several years from 1887, but she eventually turned to stage direction and costume design, creating costumes for Terry, Lillie Langtry, and others early in the 20th century.

==Shaw, Ibsen, Barrie==

In 1902 Terry played Mistress Page in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, with Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Falstaff and Madge Kendal as Mistress Ford. In the 1890s, Terry had struck up a friendship and conducted a famous correspondence with George Bernard Shaw, who wished to begin a theatrical venture with her. In 1903, Terry formed a new theatrical company, taking over management of the Imperial Theatre with her son, after her business partner Irving ended his tenure at the Lyceum in 1902. Here she had complete artistic control and could choose the works in which she would appear, as Irving had done at the Lyceum. The new venture focused on the plays of Shaw and Henrik Ibsen, including the latter&#x27;s &quot;The Vikings&quot; in 1903, with Terry as the warlike Hiordis, a misjudged role for her. Theatre management turned out to be a financial failure for Terry, who had hoped the venture would showcase her son&#x27;s set design and directing talents and her daughter&#x27;s costume designs. She then toured England, taking engagements in Nottingham, Liverpool, and Wolverhampton, and created the title role in 1905 in J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre. Irving died in October 1905, and the distraught Terry briefly left the stage.

She returned to the theatre in April 1906, playing Lady Cecily Wayneflete to acclaim in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot; at the Court Theatre and touring successfully in that role in Britain and America. On 12 June 1906, her golden jubilee was commemorated by a star-studded gala performance at the Drury Lane Theatre, for Terry&#x27;s benefit, at which Enrico Caruso sang, W. S. Gilbert directed a performance of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, Eleonora Duse, Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Lillie Langtry, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Nellie Melba, and more than 20 members of Terry&#x27;s family performed an act of &quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot; with her, among other performances. The benefit raised £6,000 for Terry. She next appeared at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre as Hermione in Tree&#x27;s production of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. In 1907 she toured America in &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot; under the direction of Charles Frohman. During that tour, on 22 March 1907, she married her co-star, American James Carew, who had appeared with her at the Court Theatre. He was 30 years her junior, and the couple separated after two years, although they never divorced. Her acting career continued strongly.
In 1908 she was back at His Majesty&#x27;s, playing Aunt Imogen in W. Graham Robertson&#x27;s fairy play &quot;Pinkie and the Fairies&quot;. She played Nance Oldfield in &quot;A Pageant of Great Women&quot; written in 1909 by Cicely Hamilton and directed by Terry&#x27;s daughter Edith Craig. In 1910 she toured in the provinces (with Archibald Joyce) and then in the US with much success, acting, giving recitations and lecturing on the Shakespeare heroines. Returning to England, she played roles such as Nell Gwynne in &quot;The First Actress&quot; (1911) by Christopher St. John (a pseudonym for Christabel Marshall), one of the first productions of the Pioneer Players theatre society, founded in 1911 by Craig and for which Ellen Terry served as President. Also in 1911, she recorded scenes from five Shakespeare roles for the Victor Talking Machine Company, which are the only known recordings of her voice. In 1914 to 1915, Terry toured Australasia, the US and Britain, again reciting and lecturing on the Shakespeare heroines. While in the US, she underwent an operation for the removal of cataracts from both eyes, but the operation was only partly successful. In 1916, she played Darling in Barrie&#x27;s &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; (1916). During World War I she performed in many war benefits.

==Films and last years==
In 1916 she appeared in her first film as Julia Lovelace in &quot;Her Greatest Performance&quot; and continued to act in London and on tour, also making a few more films through 1922, including &quot;Victory and Peace&quot; (1918), &quot;Pillars of Society&quot; (1920), &quot;Potter&#x27;s Clay&quot; (1922), and &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot; (1922) as Buda the nursemaid, with Ivor Novello and Gladys Cooper. During this time, she continued to lecture on Shakespeare throughout England and North America. She also gave scenes from Shakespeare plays in music halls under the management of Oswald Stoll. Her last fully staged role was as the Nurse in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Lyric Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue in 1919.

In 1920 she retired from the stage and in 1922 from film. She returned to play Susan Wildersham in Walter de la Mare&#x27;s fairy play, &quot;Crossings&quot;, in November 1925 at the Lyric Hammersmith.
In 1922 the University of St Andrews conferred an honorary LLD upon Terry, and in 1925 she was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire by King George V, only the second actress, after Geneviève Ward, to be created a dame for her professional achievements. In her last years, she gradually lost her eyesight and suffered from senility. Stephen Coleridge anonymously published an annotated volume of his correspondence with Terry, &quot;The Heart of Ellen Terry&quot;, in 1928.

==Death and legacy==
On 21 July 1928, Terry died of a cerebral haemorrhage at her home at Smallhythe Place, near Tenterden, Kent, aged 81. Her son Edward later recalled, &quot;Mother looked 30 years old ... a young beautiful woman lay on the bed, like Juliet on her bier&quot;. Margaret Winser created a death mask. Terry was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. Her ashes are kept in a silver chalice on the right side of the chancel of the actors&#x27; church, St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, London, where a memorial tablet was unveiled by Sir John Martin-Harvey.

After her death, the Ellen Terry Memorial Museum was founded by Edith Craig in her mother&#x27;s memory at Smallhythe Place, an early 16th-century house that she bought at the turn of the 20th century. The museum was taken over by the National Trust in 1947.

Terry&#x27;s daughter Edith Craig became a theatre director, producer, costume designer, and an early pioneer of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in England. Terry&#x27;s son, Edward Gordon Craig, became an actor, scenery and effects designer, illustrator, and director; he also founded the Gordon Craig School for the Art of the Theatre in Florence, Italy, in 1913. The actor John Gielgud was her great-nephew. Illustrator Helen Craig is Terry&#x27;s great-granddaughter.

An archive of Ellen Terry memorabilia is held by Coventry University, which also has an Ellen Terry Building, the former Odeon cinema in Jordan&#x27;s Well. A play by David Hare, to premiere in 2025 and starring Ralph Fiennes as Irving, &quot;Grace Pervades&quot;, explores the life of Irving, Terry, Edith Craig and Edward Gordon Craig.

<text>Lorenz Oken (1 August 1779 – 11 August 1851) was a German naturalist, botanist, biologist, and ornithologist.

==Biography==
Oken was born Lorenz Okenfuss () in Bohlsbach (now part of Offenburg), Ortenau, Baden, and studied natural history and medicine at the universities of Freiburg and Würzburg. He went on to the University of Göttingen, where he became a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (unsalaried lecturer), and shortened his name to Oken. As Lorenz Oken, he published a small work entitled &quot;Grundriss der Naturphilosophie, der Theorie der Sinne, mit der darauf gegründeten Classification der Thiere&quot; (1802). This was the first of a series of works which established him as a leader of the movement of &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; in Germany.

In it he extended to physical science the philosophical principles which Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) had applied to epistemology and morality. Oken had been preceded in this by Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814), who, acknowledging that Kant had discovered the materials for a universal science, declared that all that was needed was a systematic coordination of these materials. Fichte undertook this task in his &quot;Doctrine of Science&quot; (&quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot;), whose aim was to construct all knowledge by &quot;a priori&quot; means. This attempt, which was merely sketched out by Fichte, was further elaborated by the philosopher Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854). Oken built on Schelling&#x27;s work, producing a synthesis of what he held Schelling to have achieved.

Oken produced the seven-volume series &quot;Allgemeine Naturgeschichte für alle Stände&quot;, with engravings by Johann Susemihl (1767–1847), and published in Stuttgart by Hoffman between 1839 and 1841.

==New system of animal classification==
In the &quot;Grundriss der Naturphilosophie&quot; of 1802 Oken sketched the outlines of the scheme he afterwards devoted himself to perfecting. The position advanced in that work, to which he continued to adhere, is that &quot;the animal classes are virtually nothing else than a representation of the sense-organs, and that they must be arranged in accordance with them.&quot; Consequently, Oken contended that there are only five animal classes:
#Dermatozoa, or invertebrates
#Glossozoa, or fish, those animals in which a true tongue makes, for the first time, its appearance
#Rhinozoa, or reptiles, in which the nose opens for the first time into the mouth and inhales air
#Otozoa, or birds, in which the ear for the first time opens externally
#Ophthalmozoa, or mammals, in which all the organs of sense are present and complete, the eyes being movable and covered with lids.

In 1805 Oken made a further advance in the application of the &quot;a priori&quot; principle in a book on generation (&quot;Die Zeugung&quot;), in which he maintained that &quot;all organic beings originate from and consist of vesicles or cells. These vesicles, when singly detached and regarded in their original process of production, are the infusorial mass or protoplasma (&quot;Urschleim&quot;) whence all larger organisms fashion themselves or are evolved. Their production is therefore nothing else than a regular agglomeration of Infusoria—not, of course, of species already elaborated or perfect, but of mucous vesicles or points in general, which first form themselves by their union or combination into particular species.&quot;

A year after the production of this treatise, Oken developed his system one stage further, and in a volume published in 1806, written with the assistance of Dietrich von Kieser (1779–1862), entitled &quot;Beiträge zur vergleichenden Zoologie, Anatomie, und Physiologie&quot;, he demonstrated that the intestines originate from the umbilical vesicle, and that this corresponds to the vitellus or yolk-bag. Caspar Wolff (1735–1794) had previously claimed to demonstrate this fact in the chick (&quot;Theoria Generationis&quot;, 1774), but he did not see its application as evidence of a general law. Oken showed the importance of the discovery as an illustration of his system. In the same work Oken described and recalled attention to the corpora Wolffiana, or &quot;primordial kidneys.&quot;

==University of Jena==
The reputation of the young &quot;Privatdozent&quot; of Göttingen had reached the ear of Johann von Goethe (1749–1832), and in 1807 Oken was invited to fill the office of Extraordinary Professor of the Medical Sciences at the University of Jena. He selected for the subject of his inaugural discourse his ideas on the &quot;Signification of the Bones of the Skull,&quot; based on a discovery of the previous year. This lecture was delivered in the presence of Goethe, as privy councillor and rector of the university, and was published in the same year, with the title, &quot;Ueber die Bedeutung der Schädelknochen&quot;. With regard to the origin of the idea, Oken narrates in his &quot;Isis&quot; that, walking one autumn day in 1806 in the Harz forest, he stumbled on the blanched skull of a deer, picked up the partially dislocated bones, and contemplated them for a while, when it suddenly occurred to him, &quot;It is a vertebral column!&quot; At a meeting of the German naturalists held at Jena some years afterwards, Professor Kieser gave an account of Oken&#x27;s discovery in the presence of the grand duke, which is printed in the &quot;Tageblatt&quot;, or &quot;proceedings,” of that meeting. The professor stated that Oken told him of his discovery when journeying in 1806 to the island of Wangerooge. On their return to Göttingen, Oken explained his ideas by reference to the skull of a turtle in Kieser&#x27;s collection, which he disarticulated for that purpose. Kieser displayed the skull, its bones marked in Oken&#x27;s handwriting.

Oken&#x27;s lectures at Jena were wide-ranging, and were highly regarded at the time. The subjects included natural philosophy, general natural history, zoology, comparative anatomy, the physiology of man, of animals and of plants. The spirit with which he grappled with the vast scope of science is characteristically illustrated in his essay &quot;Ueber das Universum als Fortsetzung des Sinnensystems&quot; (1808). In this work he lays it down that &quot;organism is none other than a combination of all the universe&#x27;s activities within a single individual body.&quot; This doctrine led him to the conviction that &quot;world and organism are one in kind, and do not stand merely in harmony with each other.&quot; In the same year he published his &quot;Erste Ideen zur Theorie des Lichts, &amp;c.&quot;, in which he advanced the proposition that &quot;light could be nothing but a polar tension of the ether, evoked by a central body in antagonism with the planets, and heat was none other than a motion of this ether&quot;—a sort of vague anticipation of the doctrine of the &quot;correlation of physical forces.&quot;

In 1809 Oken extended his system to the mineral world, arranging the ores, not according to the metals, but according to their combinations with oxygen, acids and sulphur. In 1810 he summed up his views on organic and inorganic nature into one compendious system. In the first edition of the &quot;Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie&quot;, which appeared in that and the following years, he sought to bring his different doctrines into mutual connection, and to &quot;show that the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms are not to be arranged arbitrarily in accordance with single and isolated characters, but to be based upon the cardinal organs or anatomical systems, from which a firmly established number of classes would necessarily be evolved; that each class, moreover, takes its starting-point from below, and consequently that all of them pass parallel to each other&quot;; and that, &quot;as in chemistry, where the combinations follow a definite numerical law, so also in anatomy the organs, in physiology the functions, and in natural history the classes, families, and even genera of minerals, plants, and animals present a similar arithmetical ratio.&quot; The &quot;Lehrbuch&quot; procured for Oken the title of &quot;Hofrath&quot;, or court-councillor, and in 1812 he was appointed ordinary professor of the natural sciences.

==Journal &quot;Isis&quot;==
In 1816 Oken began publication of his well-known periodical, &quot;Isis, eine encyclopädische Zeitschrift, vorzüglich für Naturgeschichte, vergleichende Anatomie und Physiologie&quot;. In this journal appeared essays and notices on the natural sciences and other subjects of interest; poetry, and even comments on the politics of other German states, were occasionally admitted. This led to representations and remonstrances from the governments criticized or impugned, and the court of Weimar called upon Oken either to suppress &quot;Isis&quot; or resign his professorship. He chose the latter alternative. The publication of &quot;Isis&quot; at Weimar was prohibited. Oken made arrangements for its issue at Rudolstadt, and this continued uninterruptedly until the year 1848.

In 1821 Oken promulgated in &quot;Isis&quot; the first idea of the annual general meetings of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians, which was realized in the following year, when the first meeting was held at Leipzig. The British Association for the Advancement of Science was at the outset avowedly organized after the German or Okenian model. In 1828 Oken resumed his original humble duties as privatdocent in the newly established University of Munich, and soon afterwards he was appointed ordinary professor in the same university. In 1832, on the proposal by the Bavarian government to transfer him to a professorship in a provincial university of the state, he resigned his appointments and left the kingdom. He was appointed in 1833 to the professorship of natural history in the then recently established University of Zurich. There he continued to reside, fulfilling his professional duties and promoting the progress of his favourite sciences, until his death.

==Homological views==
All of Oken&#x27;s writings are deductive illustrations of an assumed principle, which, with other philosophers of the transcendental school, he deemed equal to the explanation of all the mysteries of nature. According to him, the head was a repetition of the trunk—a kind of second trunk, with its limbs and other appendages; this sum of his observations and comparisons—few of which he ever gave in detail—ought always to be borne in mind in comparing the share taken by Oken in homological anatomy with the progress made by other cultivators of that philosophical branch of the science. The idea of the analogy between the skull, or parts of the skull, and the vertebral column had been previously propounded and ventilated in their lectures by Johann von Autenrieth (1772–1835) and Carl Kielmeyer (1765–1844), and in the writings of Johann Frank (1745–1821). By Oken it was applied chiefly in illustration of the mystical system of Schelling—the &quot;all-in-all&quot; and &quot;all-in-every-part.&quot; From the earliest to the latest of Oken&#x27;s writings on the subject, &quot;the head is a repetition of the whole trunk with all its systems: the brain is the spinal cord; the cranium is the vertebral column; the mouth is intestine and abdomen; the nose is the lungs and thorax; the jaws are the limbs; and the teeth the claws or nails.&quot; Johann von Spix (1781–1826) in his folio &quot;Cephalogenesis&quot; (1818), richly illustrated comparative craniology, but presented the facts under the same transcendental guise; and Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) availed himself of the extravagances of these disciples of Schelling to cast ridicule on the whole inquiry into those higher relations of parts to the archetype which Sir Richard Owen (1804–1892) called &quot;general homologies.&quot;

The vertebral theory of the skull had practically disappeared from anatomical science when the labours of Cuvier drew to their close. In Owen&#x27;s &quot;Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton&quot; the idea was not only revived but worked out for the first time inductively, and the theory rightly stated, as follows: &quot;The head is not a virtual equivalent of the trunk, but is only a portion, i.e. certain modified segments, of the whole body. The jaws are the &#x27;haemal arches&#x27; of the first two segments; they are not limbs of the head&quot; (p. 176).

Vaguely and strangely, however, as Oken had blended the idea with his &quot;a priori&quot; conception of the nature of the head, the chance of appropriating it seems to have overcome the moral sense of Goethe—unless indeed the poet deceived himself. Comparative osteology had early attracted Goethe&#x27;s attention. In 1786 he published at Jena his essay &quot;Ueber den Zwischenkieferknochen des Menschen und der Thiere&quot;, showing that the intermaxillary bone existed in man as well as in brutes. But not a word in this essay gives the remotest hint of his having then possessed the idea of the vertebral analogies of the skull. In 1820, in his &quot;Morphologie&quot;, he first publicly stated that thirty years before the date of that publication he had discovered the secret relationship between the vertebrae and the bones of the head, and that he had always continued to meditate on this subject. The circumstances under which the poet, in 1820, narrates having become inspired with the original idea are suspiciously analogous to those described by Oken in 1807, as producing the same effect on his mind. A bleached skull is accidentally discovered in both instances: in Oken&#x27;s it was that of a deer in the Harz forest; in Goethe&#x27;s it was that of a sheep picked up on the shores of the Lido, at Venice.

It may be assumed that Oken, as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Göttingen in 1806, knew nothing of this unpublished idea or discovery of Goethe, and that Goethe first became aware that Oken had the idea of the vertebral relations of the skull when he listened to the introductory discourse in which the young professor, invited by the poet to Jena, selected this very idea for its subject. It is incredible that Oken, had he adopted the idea from Goethe, or been aware of an anticipation by him, should have omitted to acknowledge the source—should not rather have eagerly embraced so appropriate an opportunity of doing graceful homage to the originality and genius of his patron.

In 1832, Oken was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="213398" wikidata="Q236287" url="?curid=213398" title="Mary de Bohun">
<text>Mary de Bohun (c. 1369/70 – 4 June 1394) was the first wife of Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Northampton and Hereford and the mother of King Henry V. Mary was never queen, as she died before her husband came to the throne as Henry IV.

==Early life==
Mary was a daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford (1341–1373) by his wife Joan Fitzalan (1347/8–1419), a daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel, and Eleanor of Lancaster.

Mary and her elder sister, Eleanor de Bohun, were the heiresses of their father&#x27;s substantial possessions. Eleanor became the wife of Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, the youngest child of Edward III. In an effort to keep the entire inheritance for himself and his wife, Thomas of Woodstock pressured the child Mary into becoming a nun. In a plot with John of Gaunt, Mary&#x27;s aunt took her from Thomas&#x27; castle at Pleshey back to Arundel whereupon she was married to Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV.

==Marriage and children==
Mary married Henry—then known as Bolingbroke—on 5 February 1381, at Arundel Castle. It was at Monmouth Castle, one of her husband&#x27;s possessions, that Mary gave birth to her first child, the future Henry V, on 16 September 1386. Her second child, Thomas, was born probably at London shortly before 25 November 1387.

Her children were:
* Henry V, King of England (1386–1422)
* Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence (1387–1421)
* John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford (1389–1435)
* Humphrey of Lancaster, Duke of Gloucester (1390–1447)
* Blanche of England (1392–1409) married in 1402 Louis III, Elector Palatine
* Philippa of England (1394–1430) married in 1406 Eric of Pomerania, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden

== Death ==
Mary de Bohun died at Peterborough Castle, giving birth to her daughter Philippa. She was buried in the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, Leicester, on 6 July 1394.

<doc id="213399" wikidata="Q341143" url="?curid=213399" title="Amidah">
<text>The Amidah (, Tefilat HaAmidah, &#x27;The Standing Prayer&#x27;), also called the Shemoneh Esreh ( &#x27;eighteen&#x27;), is the central prayer of Jewish liturgy. Observant Jews recite the &quot;Amidah&quot; during each of the three services prayed on weekdays: Morning (&quot;Shacharit&quot;), afternoon (&quot;Mincha&quot;), and evening (&quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot;). On Shabbat, Rosh Chodesh, and Jewish festivals, a fourth &quot;Amidah&quot; (&quot;Mussaf&quot;) is recited after the morning Torah reading. Once annually, a fifth &quot;Amidah&quot; (&quot;Ne&#x27;ilah&quot;) is recited around sunset on Yom Kippur. Due to the importance of the &quot;Amidah&quot;, in rabbinic literature, it is simply called &quot;hatefila&quot; (, &quot;the prayer&quot;). According to legend, the prayer was composed by the rabbis of the Anshei Knesset HaGedolah (–332 BCE). Accordingly, in Judaism, to recite the &quot;Amidah&quot; is a &quot;mitzvah&quot; &quot;de-rabbanan&quot;, or, in other words, a commandment of rabbinic origin.

Although the name &quot;Shemoneh Esreh&quot; (&quot;eighteen&quot;) refers to the original number of component blessings in the prayer, the typical weekday &quot;Amidah&quot; actually consists of nineteen blessings.

Among other prayers, the &quot;Amidah&quot; can be found in the &quot;siddur&quot;, the traditional Jewish prayer book. The prayer is typically recited standing with feet firmly together, preferably while facing Jerusalem. In Orthodox public worship, the &quot;Amidah&quot; is usually first prayed quietly by the congregation and then repeated aloud by the &quot;chazzan&quot; (reader); it is not repeated in the &quot;Maariv&quot; prayer. The repetition&#x27;s original purpose was to give illiterate members of the congregation a chance to participate in the collective prayer by answering &quot;Amen&quot;. Conservative and Reform congregations sometimes abbreviate the public recitation of the &quot;Amidah&quot; according to their customs. When the &quot;Amidah&quot; is modified for specific prayers or occasions, the first three blessings and the last three remain unchanged, framing the &quot;Amidah&quot; used in each service, while the middle thirteen blessings are replaced by blessings (usually just one) specific to the occasion.

==Origin==
There has been a general consensus that the eighteen blessings of the Amidah generally go back to some form in the Second Temple period. In the time of the Mishnah, it was considered unnecessary to fully prescribe its text and content. This may have been simply because the language was well known to the Mishnah&#x27;s authors. The Mishnah may also have not recorded specific text because of an aversion to making prayer a matter of rigor and fixed formula.

According to the Talmud, Rabban Gamaliel II, the first leader of the Sanhedrin after the fall of the Second Temple in 70 CE, undertook to codify uniformly the public service, directing Simeon HaPakoli to edit the blessings (probably in the order they had already acquired) and made it a duty, incumbent on everyone, to recite the prayer three times daily. But this does not imply that the blessings were unknown before that date; in other passages, the &quot;Amidah&quot; is traced to the &quot;first wise men&quot;, or to the Great Assembly. In order to reconcile the various assertions of editorship, the Talmud concludes that the prayers had fallen into disuse, and that Gamaliel reinstituted them.

The Talmud indicates that when Gamaliel undertook to codify the &quot;Amidah&quot;, he directed Samuel ha-Katan to write another paragraph inveighing against informers and heretics, which was inserted as the twelfth prayer in modern sequence, making the number of blessings nineteen. Other Talmudic sources indicate, however, that this prayer was part of the original 18; and that 19 prayers came about when the 15th prayer for the restoration of Jerusalem and of the throne of David (coming of the Messiah) was split into two.

==When the &quot;Amidah&quot; is recited==

On regular weekdays, the &quot;Amidah&quot; is prayed three times, once each during the morning, afternoon, and evening prayer services that are known respectively as &quot;Shacharit&quot;, &quot;Mincha&quot;, and &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot;.
One opinion in the Talmud claims, with support from Biblical verses, that the concept for each of the three services was founded respectively by each of the three biblical patriarchs. The prescribed times for reciting the &quot;Amidah&quot; thus may come from the times of the public &quot;tamid&quot; (&quot;eternal&quot;) sacrifices that took place in the Temples in Jerusalem. After the Second Temple&#x27;s destruction in 70 CE, the Council of Jamnia determined that the &quot;Amidah&quot; would substitute for the sacrifices, directly applying Hosea&#x27;s dictate, &quot;So we will render for bullocks the offering of our lips.&quot; For this reason, the &quot;Amidah&quot; should be recited during the time period in which the &quot;tamid&quot; would have been offered. Accordingly, since the Ma&#x27;ariv service was originally optional, as it replaces the overnight burning of ashes on the Temple altar rather than a specific sacrifice, Maariv&#x27;s &quot;Amidah&quot; is not repeated by the hazzan (reader), while all other Amidot are repeated.

On Shabbat, Rosh Chodesh, and other Jewish holidays there is a &quot;Mussaf&quot; (&quot;Additional&quot;) &quot;Amidah&quot; to replace the additional communal sacrifices of these days. On Yom Kippur, a fifth recitation, Ne&#x27;ilah, is added as well.

==Structure of Weekday Amidah==
The weekday &quot;Amidah&quot; contains nineteen blessings. Each blessing ends with the signature &quot;Blessed are you, O Lord...&quot; and the opening blessing begins with this signature as well.

The first three blessings as a section are known as the &quot;shevach&quot; (&quot;praise&quot;), and serve to inspire the worshipper and invoke God&#x27;s mercy. The middle thirteen blessings compose the &quot;bakashah&quot; (&quot;request&quot;), with six personal requests, six communal requests, and a final request that God accept the prayers. The final three blessings, known as the &quot;hoda&#x27;ah&quot; (&quot;gratitude&quot;), thank God for the opportunity to serve the Lord. The &quot;shevach&quot; and &quot;hoda&#x27;ah&quot; are standard for every &quot;Amidah&quot;, with some changes on certain occasions.

===The nineteen blessings===
The nineteen blessings are as follows:

# &quot;Avot&quot; (&#x27;ancestors&#x27;) – praises of God as the God of the Biblical patriarchs, &quot;God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.&quot;
# &quot;Gevurot&quot; (&#x27;powers&#x27;) – praises God for His power and might. This prayer includes a mention of God&#x27;s healing of the sick and resurrection of the dead. It is called also &quot;Tehiyyat ha-Metim&quot; (&#x27;resurrection of the dead&#x27;). Rain is considered as great a manifestation of power as the resurrection of the dead; hence, in winter, a line recognizing God&#x27;s bestowal of rain is inserted in this blessing. Aside from Ashkenazim, most communities also insert a line recognizing dew in the summer.
# &quot;Kedushat ha-Shem&quot; (&#x27;sanctification of the Name&#x27;) – praises God&#x27;s holiness. During the chazzan&#x27;s repetition, a longer version of the blessing called Kedusha is chanted responsively. The Kedusha is further expanded on Shabbat and Festivals.
# &quot;Binah&quot; (&#x27;understanding&#x27;) – asks God to grant wisdom and understanding.
# &quot;Teshuvah&quot; (&#x27;return&#x27;, &#x27;repentance&#x27;) – asks God to help Jews to return to a life based on the Torah, and praises God as a God of repentance.
# &quot;Selichah&quot; – asks for forgiveness for all sins, and praises God as being a God of forgiveness.
# &quot;Geulah&quot; (&#x27;redemption&#x27;) – asks God to rescue the people Israel. On fast days, the chazzan adds in the blessing Aneinu during his repetition after concluding the &quot;Geulah&quot; blessing.
# &quot;Refuah&quot; (&quot;) – a prayer to heal the sick. An addition can ask for the healing of a specific person or more than one name. The phrasing uses the person&#x27;s Jewish name and the name of their Jewish mother (or ).
# &quot;Birkat HaShanim&quot; (&#x27;blessing for years [of good]&#x27;) – asks God to bless the produce of the earth. A prayer for rain is included in this blessing during the rainy season.
# &quot;Galuyot&quot; (&#x27;diasporas&#x27;) – asks God to allow the ingathering of the Jewish exiles back to the land of Israel.
# &quot;Birkat HaDin&quot; (&#x27;justice&#x27;) – asks God to restore righteous judges, as in the days of old.
# &quot;Birkat HaMinim&quot; (&#x27;sectarians&#x27;, &#x27;heretics&#x27;) – asks God to destroy those in heretical sects, who slander Jews and who act as informers against Jews.
# &quot;Tzadikim&quot; (&#x27;the righteous&#x27;) – asks God to have mercy on all who trust in Him, and asks for support for the righteous.
# &quot;Boneh Yerushalayim&quot; (&#x27;Builder of Jerusalem&#x27;) – asks God to rebuild Jerusalem, and to restore the Kingdom of David.
# &quot;Birkat David&quot; (&#x27;Blessing of David&#x27;) – asks God to bring the descendant of King David, who will be the messiah.
# &quot;Tefillah&quot; (&#x27;prayer&#x27;) – asks God to accept our prayers, to have mercy and be compassionate. On fast days, Ashkenazic Jews insert Aneinu into this blessing during Mincha. Sephardic Jews recite it during Shacharit as well, and Yemenite Jews recite it also at maariv preceding a fast day.
# &quot;Avodah&quot; (&#x27;service&#x27;) – asks God to restore the Temple services and sacrificial services.
# &quot;Hoda&#x27;ah&quot; (&#x27;thanksgiving&#x27;) – thanks God for our lives, for our souls, and for God&#x27;s miracles that are with us every day. When the Chazzan reaches this blessing during the repetition, the congregation recites a prayer called &quot;Modim deRabbanan&quot; (&#x27;thanksgiving of the Rabbis&#x27;). After this point, Birkat Kohanim is recited either by the Kohanim or by the Chazzan during his repetition during Shacharit and Musaf Amidah. It is also recited during Mincha on fast days, and during Mussaf when applicable and Neilah on Yom Kippur.
# &quot;Sim Shalom&quot; (&#x27;grant peace&#x27;) – asks God for peace, goodness, blessings, kindness, and compassion. Ashkenazim generally say a shorter version of this blessing at Minchah and Maariv, called Shalom Rav, and this formula was recited in all prayers in Provence.

===Concluding meditation===
The custom has gradually developed of reciting, at the conclusion of the latter, the supplication with which Mar son of Ravina used to conclude his prayer:
My God, keep my tongue and my lips from speaking deceit, and to them that curse me let my soul be silent, and like dust to all. Open my heart in Your Torah, and after [in] Thy commandments let me [my soul] pursue. As for those that think evil of [against] me speedily thwart their counsel and destroy their plots. Do [this] for Thy name&#x27;s sake, do this for Thy right hand&#x27;s sake, do this for the sake of Thy holiness, do this for the sake of Thy Torah. That Thy beloved ones may rejoice, let Thy right hand bring on help [salvation] and answer me... 

At this point, some say a Biblical verse related to their name(s). For example, someone named Leah might say , since both Leah and this verse begin with the letter &quot;Lamed&quot; and end with &quot;Hay&quot;. This practice is first recorded in the 16th century, and was popularized by the &quot;Shelah&quot;.

Then (which was the final line of Mar son of Ravina&#x27;s supplication) is recited.

Three steps back are followed by a followup prayer:

Mainstream Ashkenazi Orthodox Judaism also adds the following prayer to the conclusion of every &quot;Amidah&quot;:
May it be your will, O my God and God of my fathers, that the Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and give us our portion in your Torah, and there we will worship you with reverence as in ancient days and former years. And may the Mincha offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in ancient days and former years.

Many Sephardi prayer books correspondingly add:
May it be your will, O my God and God of my fathers, that You Shall speedily rebuild the Temple in our days, and give us our portion in your Torah, so that we may fulfill your statutes and do Your Will and serve you with all our heart.

Many also customary add individual personal prayers as part of quiet recitation of the &quot;Amidah&quot;. Rabbi Shimon discourages praying by rote: &quot;But rather make your prayer a request for mercy and compassion before the Ominipresent.&quot; Some authorities encourage the worshipper to say something new in his prayer every time.

===The repetition===
In Orthodox and Conservative (Masorti) public worship, the &quot;Amidah&quot; is first prayed quietly by the congregation; it is then repeated aloud by the chazzan (reader), except for the evening &quot;Amidah&quot; or when a minyan is not present. The congregation responds &quot;Amen&quot; to each blessing, and many recite &quot;Baruch Hu Uvaruch Shemo&quot; (&quot;blessed is He and blessed is His Name&quot;) when the chazzan invokes God&#x27;s name in the signature &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord...&quot; Some say that if there are not six members of the minyan responding &quot;Amen,&quot; the chazzan&#x27;s blessing is considered in vain.

The repetition&#x27;s original purpose was to allow individual who did not know the prayer text to be included in the chazzan&#x27;s &quot;Amidah&quot; by answering &quot;Amen.&quot;

====Shortened repetition====
The public recitation of the &quot;Amidah&quot; is sometimes abbreviated, with the first three blessings (including &quot;Kedushah&quot;) said out loud and the remainder quietly. The individual&#x27;s quiet repetition of the &quot;Amidah&quot; is said afterwards, not before. This practice is commonly referred to as &quot;&quot; (, lit. &quot;high (loud) kedushah&quot;), or in modern Hebrew as &quot;mincha ketzarah&quot; (Hebrew מנחה קצרה, lit. &quot;short mincha&quot;), or sometimes as &quot;bekol ram&quot; (Hebrew בקול רם, lit. &quot;in a high voice&quot;). It is occasionally performed in Orthodox prayers (in some communities it is customary for mincha to be recited in this way), and more common in Conservative and Reform congregations. A variety of customs exist for how exactly this practice is performed.

==Manner of prayer==
The laws concerning the &quot;Amidah&quot; are designed to focus one&#x27;s concentration as one beseeches God one-on-one.

===Concentration===
Prayer in Judaism is called &quot;avodah shebalev&quot; (&quot;service of the heart&quot;). Thus, prayer is meaningful only if one focuses one&#x27;s emotions and intention (&quot;kavanah&quot;) on the words of the prayers. The &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; thus advises that one pray using a translation one can understand (i.e., one&#x27;s vernacular), but learning the meaning of the Hebrew liturgy is ideal.

&quot;Halakhah&quot; requires that the first blessing of the &quot;Amidah&quot; be said with full intention and attention; if said by rote alone, it must be repeated with intention. Moses Isserles (16th century) wrote that this is no longer necessary because &quot;nowadays ... even in the repetition it is likely he will not have intention&quot;. The second to last blessing of &quot;Hoda&#x27;ah&quot; also prioritizes &quot;kavanah&quot;.

When the &quot;Amidah&quot; is said by oneself in the presence of others, many Jews who wear a &quot;tallit&quot; (prayer shawl) will drape the &quot;tallit&quot; over their head, allowing their field of vision to be focused only on the &quot;siddur&quot; and personal prayer.

===Interruptions===
Interrupting the &quot;Amidah&quot; is forbidden. The only exceptions are in cases of danger or to urgently relieve oneself. There are also &quot;halakhot&quot; to prevent interrupting the &quot;Amidah&quot; of others; for example, it is forbidden to sit next to someone praying or to walk within four &quot;amot&quot; (cubits) of someone praying.

===Quiet prayer===
The guideline of quiet prayer comes from Hannah&#x27;s behavior when she prayed in the Temple to bear a child. She prayed &quot;speaking upon her heart&quot; so that no one could hear, yet her lips were moving. Therefore, when saying the &quot;Amidah&quot;, one&#x27;s voice should be audible to oneself but not loud enough for others to hear.

===Standing===
The term &quot;Amidah,&quot; derived from the Hebrew gerund meaning &quot;standing,&quot; refers to the practice of reciting the prayer while standing with one&#x27;s feet together. This posture is believed to mimic the appearance of angels, who, according to the biblical prophet Ezekiel, have &quot;one straight leg.&quot; As worshippers address the Divine Presence, they must remove all material thoughts from their mind—just as angels are said to be purely spiritual beings. Similarly, the Tiferet Yisrael explains in his commentary, &quot;Boaz&quot;, that the &quot;Amidah&quot; is so-called because it helps a person focus their thoughts. By nature, a person&#x27;s brain is active and wandering. The &quot;Amidah&quot; brings everything into focus.

The Talmud says that one who is riding an animal or sitting in a boat (or by modern extension, flying in an airplane) may recite the &quot;Amidah&quot; while seated, as the precarity of standing would disturb one&#x27;s focus. &quot;Halakha&quot; traditionally allows individuals with illnesses or disabilities that prevent them from standing during prayer to pray while seated or, if needed, lying on their side.

===Facing Jerusalem===
The &quot;Amidah&quot; is preferably said facing Jerusalem, as suggested by Solomon&#x27;s prayer:
The Talmud records the following &quot;baraita&quot; on this topic:
While many Jews calculate the direction to Jerusalem in terms of a simple straight line on the map (rhumb line), some authorities of &quot;Halakha&quot; rule that one should instead follow a great circle route to Jerusalem, which is more direct. In practice, many synagogues do not face exactly towards Israel or Jerusalem. Sources disagree on whether or not it is necessary to calculate the direction precisely, and in any case, one should not face Jerusalem if it means turning their back to the Torah ark.

===Three steps===
There are varying customs related to taking three steps backwards (and then forwards) before reciting the &quot;Amidah&quot; and after the &quot;Amidah&quot;. Before reciting the &quot;Amidah&quot;, it is customary for Ashkenazim to take three steps back and then three steps forward. The steps backward at the beginning represent withdrawing one&#x27;s attention from the material world and stepping forward to symbolically approach the King of Kings. The &quot;Mekhilta&quot; notes that the significance of the three steps is based on the three barriers Moses had to pass through at Sinai before entering God&#x27;s realm. The &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; ruled that only the steps forward are required, while the backward steps beforehand are just a prevalent custom. It is not the custom of the Sephardim to step backward or forward prior to reciting the &quot;Amidah&quot;.

Both Ashkenazi and Sephardi/Edot HaMizrach &quot;siddurim&quot; mention the practice of taking three steps back upon finishing the final meditation after the &quot;Amidah&quot;.

One takes three steps back upon finishing the final meditation after the &quot;Amidah&quot;, and then says, while bowing left, right, and forward, &quot;He who makes peace in the heavens, may He make peace for us and all Israel, and let us say, Amen.&quot; Many have the custom to remain standing in place until immediately before the &quot;chazzan&quot; reaches the &quot;Kedusha&quot;, and then take three steps forward. The Talmud understands this as a reminder of the practice in the Temple in Jerusalem when those offering the daily sacrifices would walk backward from the altar after finishing. It also compares the practice to a student&#x27;s respectfully backs away from their teacher.

===Bowing===
The worshipper bows at four points in the &quot;Amidah&quot;: at the beginning and end of two blessings, &quot;Avot&quot; and &quot;Hoda&#x27;ah&quot;. It is the custom of the Ashkenazim that one bends the knees when saying &quot;Blessed&quot;, then bows at &quot;are You&quot;, and straightens while saying &quot;O Lord&quot;. (At the beginning of &quot;Hoda&#x27;ah&quot;, one instead bows while saying the opening words &quot;We are grateful to You&quot; without bending the knees.) The reason for this procedure is that the Hebrew word for &quot;blessed&quot; (&quot;baruch&quot;) is related to &quot;knee&quot; (&quot;berech&quot;), and a verse in Psalm 146 states, &quot;The Lord straightens the bent.&quot; At each of these bows, one must bend over until the vertebrae protrude from one&#x27;s back; one physically unable to do so suffices by nodding the head. It is not the custom of the Sephardim to bend the knees during the &quot;Amidah&quot;.

During certain parts of the &quot;Amidah&quot; said on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, including the Yom Kippur Avodah, Ashkenazi Jews traditionally go down to the floor upon their knees and make their upper body bowed over like an arch, similar to the Muslim practice of &quot;sujud&quot;. There are some variations in Ashkenazi customs as to how long one remains in this position. Some members of the Dor Daim movement also bow in this manner in their daily &quot;Amidah&quot; prayers.

==Special &quot;Amidot&quot;==
===Shabbat===
On Shabbat, the middle 13 blessings of the &quot;Amidah&quot; are replaced by one, known as &quot;Kedushat haYom&quot; (&quot;sanctity of the day&quot;), so that each Shabbat &quot;Amidah&quot; is composed of seven blessings. The &quot;Kedushat haYom&quot; has an introductory portion, which on Sabbath is varied for each of the four services, and short concluding portion, which is constant:
Our God and God of our Ancestors! Be pleased with our rest; sanctify us with Your commandments, give us a share in Your Torah, satiate us with Your bounty, and gladden us in Your salvation. Cleanse our hearts to serve You in truth: let us inherit, O Lord our God, in love and favor, Your holy Sabbath, and may Israel, who loves Your name, rest thereon. Praised are You, O Lord, who sanctifies the Sabbath.

On Sabbath eve, after the congregation has read the &quot;Amidah&quot; quietly, the reader repeats aloud the &quot;Me&#x27;ein Sheva&quot;&#x27;, or summary of the seven blessings. Although this is a repetition intended to be recited by the leader alon, the common Ashkenazic practice (except for those who follow the Vilna Gaon is that the congregation recited the middle part aloud, and then the leader repeats it:
Shield of the fathers by His word, who revives the dead by His command, the holy God to whom none is like; who causes His people to rest on His holy Sabbath-day, for in them He took delight to cause them to rest. Before Him we shall worship in reverence and fear. We shall render thanks to His name on every day constantly in the manner of the blessings. God of praises, Lord of peace, who sanctifies the Sabbath and blesses the seventh [day], and causes the people who are filled with Sabbath delight to rest, as a memorial of the work in the beginning of Creation.

===Festivals===
On festivals, like on Shabbat, the intermediate 13 blessings are replaced by a single blessing concerning &quot;Sanctification of the Day&quot; prayer. However, the text of this blessing differs from on Shabbat. The first section is constant on all holidays:
You have chosen us from all the nations, You have loved us and was pleased with us; You lifted us above all tongues, and sanctified us with Your commandments, and brought us, O our King, to Your service, and pronounced over us Your great and holy name.
A paragraph naming the festival and its special character follow.

If the Sabbath coincides with a festival, the festival blessing is recited, but with special additions relating to Shabbat.

===Mussaf===

On the Shabbat, festivals (i.e., on Yom Tov and on Chol HaMoed), and on Rosh Chodesh, a fourth &quot;Amidah&quot; prayer is recited, entitled &quot;Mussaf&quot; (&quot;additional&quot;). Like the Shacharit and Mincha &quot;Amidah&quot;, it is recited both quietly and repeated by the Reader.

The &quot;Mussaf Amidah&quot; begins with the same first three and concludes with the same last three blessings as the regular &quot;Amidah&quot;. In place of the 13 intermediate blessings of the daily service, a single blessing is added, relating to the holiday. (The Mussaf Amidah on Rosh Hashanah is unique in that apart from the first and last 3 blessings, it contains 3 central blessings making a total of 9.)

Historically (and currently in Orthodox services), the middle blessing focuses on the special Mussaf sacrifice that was offered in the Temple in Jerusalem, and contains a plea for the building of a Third Temple and the restoration of sacrificial worship. In modern times, some non-Orthodox movements have modified the text of Mussaf, or else omit it entirely.

===Ne&#x27;ila===

A fifth &quot;Amidah&quot; (in addition to Ma&#x27;ariv, Shacharit, Mussaf, and Mincha) is recited and repeated at the closing of Yom Kippur. The congregation traditionally stands during the entire repetition of this prayer, which contains a variety of confessional and supplicatory additions. In the Ashkenazi custom, it is also the only time that the Avinu Malkeinu prayer is said on Shabbat, should Yom Kippur fall on Shabbat.

===Truncated &quot;Amidah&quot; (&quot;Havineinu&quot;)===

The Mishnah (Brachot 4:3) and Talmud (Brachot 29a) mention the option of saying a truncated version of the &quot;Amidah&quot;, if one is in a rush or under pressure. It consists of only seven blessings - the usual first three and last three, and a middle blessing named after its first word, &quot;Havineinu&quot;.

==Seasonal changes==

===Prayers for rain and dew===

Due to the importance of winter rains to agriculture in Israel, two blessings are changed in fall and winter to refer to rain.

====Mentioning rain====
Between the holidays of Shemini Atzeret and Passover respectively, God&#x27;s &quot;power of [providing] rain&quot; () is mentioned in the second blessing of the &quot;Amidah&quot; (&quot;Gevurot&quot;). This is done by inserting the phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;He [God] causes the wind to blow and the rain to fall&quot;). The most prominent of God&#x27;s powers mentioned in this blessing is the resurrection of the dead. Rain is mentioned here because God&#x27;s provision of rain is considered to be as great a manifestation of His power as the resurrection.

Rain is not mentioned in spring and summer, when rain does not fall in Israel. Nevertheless, given the importance of moisture during the dry summer of Israel, many versions of the liturgy insert the phrase &quot;&quot;, &quot;He causes the dew to fall&quot;, during every &quot;Amidah&quot; of the dry half of the year, even though the Talmud explicitly says that there is no obligation to do so.

On Shemini Atzeret and Passover, special extended prayers for rain or dew (known as &quot;Tefillat Geshem&quot; and &quot;Tefillat Tal&quot; respectively) are recited to introduce the change to the &quot;Amidah&quot;. In the Ashkenazic tradition, both prayers are recited by the Reader during the repetition of the &quot;Mussaf Amidah&quot;; however, many Nusach Ashkenaz communities in Israel have adopted the Sephardic custom to recite it before the &quot;Mussaf Amidah&quot;. In the normative contemporary Sephardic tradition, which prohibits such additions, places them before the &quot;Mussaf Amidah&quot;; the exception is that Spanish and Portuguese communities follow the older custom to recite it during the repetition. The change is made on these holidays because they are days of great joy, and because they are days of heavy attendance at public prayers. Therefore, the seasonal change in the language of the prayers is immediately and widely disseminated.

====Requesting rain====
A &quot;request&quot; or prayer for rain () is also recited in winter, though for a shorter period. In Israel (and among the of Jews in Djerba), this recitation begins on the 7th of Cheshvan. Although the Jerusalem Talmud says that after the destruction of the Temple, we should begin the recitation immediately after Sukkos, the Halachah does not follow this opinion. The 15-day delay between Shemini Atzeret and 7 Cheshvan was instituted so that visitors to the Temple in Jerusalem would be able to arrive home before prayers for rain began, as rain would interfere with their journey. Elsewhere, outside Israel, this season is defined as beginning on the 60th day after the autumnal equinox (&quot;Tekufat Tishrei&quot;) – in the 20th and 21st century, this is usually on 4 December. In all cases, the recitation ends on Passover.

Requesting rain is done in the ninth blessing of the weekday &quot;Amidah&quot;. In Ashkenazi custom, this is done by insertion of the words &quot;may You grant dew and rain&quot; in this blessing. In Sephardi and Yemenite Jewish rituals, the blessing is changed more dramatically. During the dry season, the blessing has this form:
In the rainy season, the text is changed to read:
===Conclusion of Shabbat and festivals===
At the &quot;Maariv Amidah&quot; following the conclusion of a Shabbat or Yom Tov, a paragraph beginning &quot;Atah Chonantanu&quot; (&quot;You have granted us...&quot;) is inserted into the weekday &quot;Amidah&#x27;s&quot; fourth blessing of &quot;Binah&quot;. The paragraph thanks God for the ability to separate between the holy and mundane, paraphrasing the concepts found in the Havdalah ceremony. In fact, the Talmud teaches that if this paragraph is forgotten, the &quot;Amidah&quot; need not be repeated, because Havdalah will be said later over wine. Once &quot;Atah Chonantanu&quot; is said, work prohibited on the holy day becomes permitted because the separation from the holy day has been established.

===The Ten Days of Repentance===
During the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, additional lines are inserted in the first, second, second to last, and last blessings of all &quot;Amidot&quot;. These lines invoke God&#x27;s mercy and pray for inscription in the Book of Life. In many communities, when the chazzan reaches these lines during his repetition, he pauses and the congregation recites the lines before him; in other communities, the congregation recites the additions only in the last two blessings, but not in the first two. During the final recitation of the &quot;Amidah&quot; on Yom Kippur the prayer is slightly modified to read &quot;seal us&quot; in the book of life, rather than &quot;write us&quot;.

Moreover, the signatures of two blessings are changed to reflect the days&#x27; heightened recognition of God&#x27;s sovereignty. In the third blessing, the signature &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord, the Holy God&quot; is replaced with &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord, the Holy King&quot;. On weekdays, the signature of the eleventh blessing is changed from &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord, King who loves justice and judgement&quot; to &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord, the King of judgement&quot;. In many Ashkenazic communities, it is also customary to conclude the last Blessing &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord, who makes peace&quot; instead of &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord, who blesses His people with peace&quot;.

===Fast days===
On public fast days, special prayers for mercy are added to the &quot;Amidah&quot;. There are three customs as to at which prayers individuals recite the text of &quot;Aneinu&quot; without its signature in the blessing of &quot;Shomea Tefillah&quot;:

* According to the Yemenite custom (based on the custom of the Gaonim), it is recited at Shacharit and Mincha of the fast, as well as at Maariv on the night proceeding the fast.
* According to the Sephardic custom, it is recited at Shacharit and Mincha; and on Tisha Bav, when the fast begins at night, it is also recited in Maariv (effectively making this the same as the previous custom when it comes to Tisha Bav).
* According to the Ashkenazic custom, it is recited by individuals only at Mincha.

In all customs, the chazzan adds &quot;Aneinu&quot; as additional blessing in his repetition right after the blessing of &quot;Geulah&quot;, known by its first word &quot;Aneinu&quot; (&quot;Answer us&quot;) in both Shacharit and Mincha. The blessing concludes with the signature &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord, Who responds [some say: to His nation Israel] in time of trouble.&quot; In addition, according to the original custom, Selichot are recited in the middle of the blessing for forgiveness during the Chazzan&#x27;s repetition.

At mincha, Ashkenazic communities that say the &quot;Shalom Rav&quot; version of the &quot;Shalom&quot; blessing at Minchah and Maariv say the &quot;Sim Shalom&quot; at this Minchah. The chazzan also says the priestly blessing before &quot;Shalom&quot; as he would at Shacharit, unlike the usual weekday Minchah when the priestly blessing is not said at Mincha; in many communities where the Kohanim recite Birkat Kohanim daily, this is recited now as well, particularly if Mincha is recited later in the day.

On Tisha B&#x27;Av at Minchah, Ashkenazim add a prayer that begins &quot;Nachem&quot; (&quot;Console...&quot;) to the conclusion of the blessing &quot;Binyan Yerushalayim&quot;, elaborating on the mournful state of the Temple in Jerusalem. The concluding signature of the blessing is also extended to say &quot;Blessed are You, O Lord, Who consoles Zion and builds Jerusalem.&quot; In other traditions, it is said in all the Amidot of Tisha B&#x27;av, or not included at all.

===Ya&#x27;aleh VeYavo===
On Chol HaMoed and Rosh Chodesh, the prayer &quot;Ya&#x27;aleh Veyavo&quot; (&quot;May [our remembrance] rise and be seen...&quot;) is inserted in the blessing of &quot;Avodah&quot;. &quot;Ya&#x27;aleh Veyavo&quot; is also said in the &quot;Kedushat HaYom&quot; blessing of the Festival &quot;Amidah&quot;, and at Birkat HaMazon. One phrase of the prayer varies according to the day&#x27;s holiday, mentioning it by name. Often, the first line is uttered aloud so that others will be reminded of the change.

===Al HaNissim===

On Hanukkah and Purim, the weekday or sabbath Amidot are recited, but a special paragraph is inserted into the blessing of &quot;Hoda&#x27;ah&quot;. Each holiday&#x27;s paragraph recounts the historical background of that holiday, thanking God for his salvation. Both paragraphs are prefaced by the same opening line, &quot;[We thank You] for the miraculous deeds (&quot;Al HaNissim&quot;) and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season.&quot;

=== Modern changes ===
The text of the Amidah was changed by the Hassidic movement in the 18th century. They attempted to fit the Ashkenazic liturgy with the rulings of the 16th century Kabbalist Isaac Luria, commonly known in Jewish religious circles as &quot;Ha&#x27;ARI&quot; (&quot;The Ari&quot;) The Ari formulated a text that was adapted from the Sepharadi text in accordance with his understanding of Kabbalah, and the Chasidim adapted Nusach Ashkenaz to fit with his rulings, making what became known as Nusach Sefard.

Following the Zionist declaration of the State of Israel, some Orthodox authorities proposed changes to the special &quot;Nachem&quot; &quot;Console...&quot; prayer commemorating the destruction of Jerusalem added to the &quot;Amidah&quot; on Tisha B&#x27;Av in light of these events.
Conservative and Reform Judaism have altered the text to varying degrees to bring it into alignment with their view of modern needs and sensibilities. Conservative Judaism retains the traditional number and time periods during which the &quot;Amidah&quot; must be said, while omitting explicit supplications for restoration of the sacrificial offerings described and commanded in the Torah. Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism, consistent with their views that the rhythm of the ancient sacrifices should no longer drive modern Jewish prayer, often omit some of the &quot;Amidah&quot; prayers, such as the Mussaf, omit temporal requirements and references to the Temple and its sacrifices.

Reform Judaism has changed the first blessing, traditionally invoking the phrase &quot;God of our Fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac and God of Jacob&quot;, one of the Biblical names of God. New editions of the Reform siddur explicitly say &quot;our fathers and our mothers&quot;, and Reform and some Conservative congregations amend the second invocation to &quot;God of Abraham, God of Isaac and God of Jacob; God of Sarah, God of Rebekah, God of Leah, and God of Rachel&quot;. The new reform prayer book, &quot;Mishkan T&#x27;filah&quot;, reverses Leah&#x27;s and Rachel&#x27;s names. Some feminist Jews have added the names of Bilhah and Zilpah, since they were mothers to four tribes of Israel.

Liberal branches of Judaism make some additional changes to the opening blessing. the phrase (&quot;and brings a redeemer&quot;) is changed in Reform Judaism to (&quot;who brings redemption&quot;), replacing the personal messiah with a Messianic Age. The phrase (&quot;who causes the dead to come to life&quot;) is replaced in the Reform and Reconstructionist siddurim with (&quot;who gives life to all&quot;) and (&quot;who gives life to all life&quot;), respectively. This represents a turn away from the traditional article of faith that God will resurrect the dead.

Prayer 17 (&quot;Avodah&quot;) asks God to restore the Temple services, build a Third Temple, and restore sacrificial worship. The concluding meditation ends with an additional prayer for the restoration of Temple worship. Both prayers have been modified within the siddur of Conservative Judaism so that, though they still ask for the restoration of the Temple, they remove the explicit plea for the resumption of sacrifices. (Some Conservative congregations remove the concluding quiet prayer for the Temple entirely.) The Reform siddur also modifies this prayer by eliminating all reference to the Temple service and replacing the request for the restoration of the Temple with: &quot;God who is near to all who call upon you, turn to your servants and be gracious to us; pour your spirit upon us.&quot;

Many Reform congregations will often conclude with either Sim Shalom or Shalom Rav. Once either of those prayers are chanted or sung, many congregations proceed to a variation on the &quot;Mi Shebeirach&quot; (typically the version popularized by Debbie Friedman), the traditional prayer for healing, followed by silent prayer, and then a resumption of the service.

Conservative Judaism is divided on the role of the &quot;Mussaf Amidah&quot;. More traditional Conservative congregations recite a prayer similar to the Mussaf prayer in Orthodox services except that they refer to Temple sacrifices only in the past tense and do not include a prayer for the restoration of the sacrifices. More liberal Conservative congregations omit references to the Temple sacrifices entirely. Reconstructionist and Reform congregations generally do not do the &quot;Mussaf Amidah&quot; at all; if they do, they omit all references to Temple worship.

==Within the early Christian Church==
New Testament scholar Paul Barnett has identified as a modified version of the first blessing (&quot;Avot&quot;). This has also been identified by Martin Hengel in his book &quot;The Pre-Christian Paul&quot;, arguing that Saul/Paul was a teacher in the Hellenistic synagogues of Jerusalem prior to his conversion to Christianity.

<text>No Man&#x27;s Land () is a 2001 war film that is set in the midst of the Bosnian War. The film is a parable and marks the debut of Bosnian writer and director Danis Tanović. It is a co-production among companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Italy, France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. The film first premiered on 19 September 2001 in France. It later won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2002.

==Plot== 
During the Bosnian War, two wounded soldiers, a Bosniak named Čiki and a Bosnian Serb named Nino, are caught between their lines in no man&#x27;s land. The two soldiers confront each other in a trench, where they wait for dark. Trading insults at first, they eventually begin to find some common ground. Confounding the situation is another wounded Bosniak soldier named Cera who wakes from unconsciousness. A land mine has been buried beneath him by the Bosnian Serbs; should he make any move, the mine will explode.

A French Army sergeant named Marchand, of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), gets involved in an effort to help the three trapped soldiers, despite initial orders to the contrary by high command. UNPROFOR&#x27;s mission in Bosnia is to guard humanitarian aid convoys, remain neutral, and act as a mere bystander. Fortunately, a British reporter arrives on scene, bringing media pressure to bear that moves the UN high command to swing into action to try to save the soldiers.

A row between the stressed out and fatigued Čiki and Nino gradually escalates even after being rescued. Eventually, Čiki shoots Nino and in turn is shot by a UN Peacekeeper. Meanwhile, it is discovered that the mine underneath Cera cannot be defused. The UN high command tries to save face; they lie, saying that Cera has been saved and they leave the area, along with the reporters and everyone else.

In reality, Cera is left alone and desolate in the trenches, still immobilized by the mine. Meanwhile, the UN commander has arranged false information to be passed to both Bosnian and Serb forces, in order to make them believe that their enemies will be trying to reoccupy the trench at night (which each side would try to counter with an artillery barrage that will presumably kill Cera and destroy the evidence).

<text>Primula () is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. They include the primrose (&quot;P. vulgaris&quot;), a familiar wildflower of banks and verges. Other common species are &quot;P. auricula&quot; (auricula), &quot;P. veris&quot; (cowslip), and &quot;P. elatior&quot; (oxlip). These species and many others are valued for their ornamental flowers. They have been extensively cultivated and hybridised (in the case of the primrose, for many hundreds of years). &quot;Primula&quot; are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia, Indonesia, and New Guinea, and in temperate southern South America. Almost half of the known species are from the Himalayas.

&quot;Primula&quot; has over 500 species in traditional treatments, and more if certain related genera are included within its circumscription.

==Description==

&quot;Primula&quot; is a complex and varied genus, with a range of habitats from alpine slopes to boggy meadows. Plants bloom mostly during the spring, with flowers often appearing in spherical umbels on stout stems arising from basal rosettes of leaves; their flowers can be purple, yellow, red, pink, blue, or white. Some species show a white mealy bloom (farina) on various parts of the plant. Many species are adapted to alpine climates.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Primula&quot; was known at least as early as the mediaeval herbalists, although first formally described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753, and later in 1754 in his &quot;Flora Anglica&quot;. Linnaeus described seven species of &quot;Primula&quot;. One of its earliest scientific treatments was that of Charles Darwin study of heterostyly in 1877 (&quot;The different forms of flowers on plants of the same species&quot;). Since then, heterostyly (and homostyly) have remained important considerations in the taxonomic classification of Primula. Primula is a member of the Primulaceae family. The most complete treatment of the family, with nearly 1000 species arranged into 22 genera, was by Pax and Knuth in 1905.

=== Phylogeny ===
&quot;Primula&quot; is the largest genus in the family Primulaceae, within which it is placed in the subfamily Primuloideae, being the nominative genus.

The position of &quot;Primula&quot; within the family and its relationship to other genera is shown in this cladogram:
==== Classification ====
The genus &quot;Dodecatheon&quot; originated from within &quot;Primula&quot;, its species are now included in &quot;Primula&quot;.

===== Sections of genus &quot;Primula&quot; =====
The classification of the genus &quot;Primula&quot; has been investigated by botanists for over a century. As the genus is both large and diverse (with about 430–500 species), botanists have organized the species in various sub-generic groups. The most common is division into a series of thirty sections. Some of these sections (e.g. &quot;Vernales&quot;, &quot;Auricula&quot;) contain many species; others contain only one.

===Etymology===

The word &quot;primula&quot; is the Latin feminine diminutive of &quot;primus&quot;, meaning first (prime), applied to flowers that are among the first to open in spring.

==Distribution and habitat==

Although there are over 400 species of &quot;Primula&quot;, about 75% are found in the eastern Himalayan mountain chain and western China (Yunnan Province), constituting a centre of diversity. Other centres of diversity are a western Asian centre (Caucasus, European mountain ranges from the Pyrenees, through the Alps to the Carpathian Mountains), mountains of East Asia and those of western North America. &quot;Primula&quot; is found in mountainous or higher latitude zones of North America, Europe, and Asia, with extension into South America, Africa (mountains of Ethiopia) and tropical Asia (islands of Java and Sumatra). About 25 species occur in North America (represented in five sections).

&quot;Primula&quot; is found in the humid and moderate climate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, predominantly in the forest belt, plain meadows, Alpine lawns, and nival and meadow tundras.

== Ecology ==

Primulas are used as a food plant by the Duke of Burgundy butterfly.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Primula&quot; species have been extensively cultivated and hybridised, mainly derived from &quot;P. elatior&quot;, &quot;P. juliae&quot;, &quot;P. veris&quot; and &quot;P. vulgaris&quot;. Polyanthus (&quot;Primula × polyantha&quot;) is one such group of plants, which has produced a large variety of strains in all colours, usually grown as annuals or biennials and available as seeds or young plants.

Another huge range of cultivars, known as auriculas, are derived from crosses between &quot;P. auricula&quot; and &quot;P. hirsuta&quot; (among others). Specialist nurseries and auricula societies support the growing and showing of these choice strains.

<text> (; &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Delight&quot; or &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Paradise&quot;) is the eleventh novel in the &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; series by Émile Zola. It was first serialized in the periodical &quot;Gil Blas&quot; from December 17, 1882 to March 1, 1883; and published in novel form by Charpentier in 1883.

The novel is set in the world of the department store, an innovative development in mid-nineteenth century retail sales. Zola models his store after Le Bon Marché, which consolidated under one roof many of the goods hitherto sold in separate shops. The narrative details many of Le Bon Marché&#x27;s innovations, including its mail-order business, its system of commissions, its in-house staff commissary, and its methods of receiving and retailing goods.

 is a sequel to &quot;Pot-Bouille&quot;. Like its predecessor, focuses on Octave Mouret, who at the end of the previous novel married Caroline Hédouin, the owner of a small silk shop. Now a widower, Octave has expanded the business into an international retail powerhouse occupying, at the beginning of the book, the greater part of an entire city block.

==Plot summary==
The events of cover approximately 1864-1869.

The novel tells the story of Denise Baudu, a 20-year-old woman from Valognes who comes to Paris with her younger brothers and begins working as a saleswoman at the department store &quot;Au Bonheur des Dames&quot;. Zola describes the inner workings of the store from the employees&#x27; perspective, including the 13-hour workdays, the substandard food and the bare lodgings for the female staff. Many of the conflicts in the novel spring from each employee&#x27;s struggle for advancement and the malicious infighting and gossip among the staff.

Denise&#x27;s story is played against the career of Octave Mouret, the owner of Au Bonheur des Dames, whose retail innovations and store expansions threaten the existence of all the neighborhood shops. Under one roof, Octave has gathered textiles (silks, woolens) as well as all manner of ready-made garments (dresses, coats, lingerie, gloves), accessories necessary for making clothes, and ancillary items like carpeting and furniture. His aim is to overwhelm the senses of his female customers, forcing them to spend by bombarding them with an array of buying choices and by juxtaposing goods in enticing and intoxicating ways. Massive advertising, huge sales, home delivery, and a system of refunds and novelties such as a reading room and a snack bar further induce his female clientele to patronize his store in growing numbers. In the process, he drives the traditional retailers who operate smaller speciality shops out of business.

In &quot;Pot-Bouille&quot;, an earlier novel, Octave is depicted as a ladies&#x27; man, sometimes inept, who seduces or attempts to seduce women who can give him some social or financial advantage. In , he uses a young widow to influence a political figure–modeled after Baron Haussmann–in order to gain frontage access to a huge thoroughfare, the present day rue de Quatre-Septembre, for the store.

Despite his contempt for women, Octave finds himself slowly falling in love with Denise, whose refusal to be seduced by his charms further inflames him. The book ends with Denise admitting her love for Octave and agreeing to marry him. 

The depiction of women is modern. The department store is described as a place where female customers can live out their fantasies and impulses; for the female employees, it offers the possibility of financial independence.

==Relationship to the other &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; novels==
Zola designed the &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; novels to demonstrate how heredity and environment operate on the members of one family over the course of the Second French Empire. In this case, the environment is the department store.

Octave Mouret is introduced briefly in &quot;La fortune des Rougon&quot;. He plays a larger but background role in &quot;La conquête de Plassans&quot;, which focuses on his parents, the first cousins Marthe Rougon and François Mouret. As an innovator and risk-taker, Octave combines his mother&#x27;s imagination with his father&#x27;s business sense, making the department store the perfect milieu for his natural gifts.

Octave&#x27;s brother is the priest Serge (&quot;La faute de l&#x27;Abbé Mouret&quot;), who served as a guardian to their mentally challenged sister Desirée.

In &quot;Le docteur Pascal&quot;, the final novel in the series set in 1872-1873, Octave and Denise are married and have three children. Octave also appears briefly or is mentioned in &quot;La joie de vivre&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;œuvre&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted for film several times.

The novel was also adapted as an Italian language television series in 2015, &quot;Il Paradiso delle Signore&quot;, which has run for several seasons and stars Giuseppe Zeno and Giusy Buscemi.

<text>A jay is a member of a number of species of medium-sized, usually colorful and noisy, passerine birds in the crow family, Corvidae. The evolutionary relationships between the jays and the magpies are rather complex. For example, the Eurasian magpie seems more closely related to the Eurasian jay than to the East Asian blue and green magpies, whereas the blue jay is not closely related to either. The Eurasian jay distributes oak acorns, contributing to the growth of oak woodlands over time.

==Systematics and species==
Jays are not a monophyletic group. Anatomical and molecular evidence indicates they can be divided into a New World and an Old World lineage (the latter including the ground jays and the piapiac), while the grey jays of the genus &quot;Perisoreus&quot; form a group of their own. The black magpies, formerly believed to be related to jays, are classified as treepies. 

===Old World (&quot;brown&quot;) jays===

===Grey jays===

===New World jays===

==In culture==

===Slang===
The word &quot;jay&quot; has an archaic meaning in American slang meaning a person who chatters impertinently. 

The term &quot;jaywalking&quot; was coined in the first decade of the 1900s to label persons crossing a busy street carelessly and becoming a traffic hazard. The term began to imply recklessness or impertinent behavior as the convention became established.

In January 2014, Canadian author Robert Joseph Greene embarked on a lobbying campaign among ornithologists in Europe and North America to get Merriam-Websters Dictionary to have a &quot;Jabber of Jays&quot; as an official term under bird groups.

<text>William Edward Forster, PC, FRS (11 July 18185 April 1886) was an English industrialist, philanthropist and Liberal Party statesman. As a minister in Gladstone&#x27;s government, he steered through the Elementary Education Act 1870 which was the foundation of compulsory national free education for children in the UK. However his reputation was later greatly tarnished by his coercive policies as minister for Ireland, then in the throes of a struggle for independence. His purported advocacy of the Irish Constabulary&#x27;s use of lethal force against the National Land League earned him the nickname Buckshot Forster from Irish nationalists.

==Early life==
Born to William and Anna Forster, Quaker parents at Bradpole, near Bridport in Dorset, Forster was educated at the Quaker school at Tottenham, where his father&#x27;s family had long been settled, and on leaving school he was put into business. He declined to enter a brewery and became involved in woollen manufacture in Burley-in-Wharfedale, Yorkshire. In 1850 he married Jane Martha, eldest daughter of Dr Thomas Arnold. She was not a Quaker and Forster was formally read out of meeting for marrying her, but the Friends who were commissioned to announce the sentence &quot;shook hands and stayed to luncheon&quot;. Forster thereafter ranked himself as a member of the Church of England.

The Forsters had no natural children, but when Mrs Forster&#x27;s brother, William Delafield Arnold, died in 1859, leaving three orphans, the Forsters adopted them as their own. One of the children was Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster, a Liberal Unionist member of parliament, who eventually became a member of Balfour&#x27;s cabinet. Another was Florence Arnold-Forster, who started Limerick Lace and she wrote a journal about family life and politics in the 1880s. The youngest child, Frances Egerton Arnold-Forster, compiled the first systematic study of English church dedications, published in 1899 as &quot;Studies in English Church Dedications or England&#x27;s Patron Saints&quot;.

William Forster became known as a practical philanthropist. In 1846–47, he accompanied his father to Ireland as distributor of the Friends&#x27; relief fund for the Great Irish Famine in Connemara, and the state of the country made a deep impression on him. He began to take an active part in public affairs by speaking and lecturing.

==Political career==
In 1859, Forster stood as Liberal candidate for Leeds, but lost. He was highly esteemed in the West Riding, and in 1861 was returned unopposed for Bradford. He was returned again in 1865 (unopposed) and in 1868 (at the head of the poll). He took a prominent part in parliament in the debates on the American Civil War, and in 1865 was made Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in Lord John Russell&#x27;s ministry. It was then that he first became a prominent advocate of imperial federation. In 1866, his attitude on parliamentary reform attracted attention. He showed knowledge of the real condition of common people, and foreshadowed Radical legislation, heralding the start of a campaign of educational reform.
Directly after the Reform Bill had passed, Forster and Edward Cardwell brought in Education Bills in 1867 and 1868. In 1868, when the Liberal party returned to office, Forster was appointed Vice-president of the Council, with the duty of preparing a government measure for national education. The Elementary Education Bill was introduced on 17 February 1870 and school boards were set up with elected representatives (for example, Charles Reed in London) the same year where possible. The religious difficulty at once came to the front. The Manchester Education Union and the National Education League/Birmingham Education League had already formulated in the provinces the two opposing theories, the former standing for the preservation of denominational interests, the latter advocating secular rate-aided education as the only means of protecting Nonconformity against the Established Church.

The Dissenters were not satisfied with Forster&#x27;s &quot;conscience clause&quot; as contained in the bill, and they regarded him, the ex-Quaker, as a deserter from their own side. They resented the &quot;25th clause&quot;, permitting school boards to pay the fees of needy children at denominational schools out of the rates, as an insidious attack on their interests. By 14 March, at the second reading, the controversy had assumed threatening proportions; and George Dixon, the Liberal member for Birmingham and chairman of the National Education League, moved an amendment, the effect of which was to prohibit all religious education in board schools. The government made its rejection a question of confidence, and the amendment was withdrawn; but the result was the insertion of the Cowper-Temple clause (which prohibited the use of distinctive religious formularies in a rate-supported school) as a compromise before the bill passed. The bill of 1870, imperfect as it was, established at last some approach to a system of national education in England.

Forster&#x27;s next important work was in passing the Ballot Act 1872. In 1874, he was again returned for Bradford. In 1875, when Gladstone &quot;retired&quot;, Forster was strongly supported for the leadership of the Liberal party, but declined to be nominated. In the same year he was elected to the Royal Society, and made Lord Rector of Aberdeen University. In 1876, when the Eastern question was looming, he visited Serbia and Turkey, and his subsequent speeches on the subject were marked by moderation. On Gladstone&#x27;s return to office in 1880, he was made Chief Secretary for Ireland. He carried the Compensation for Disturbance Bill through the Commons, only to see it thrown out in the Lords. On 24 January 1881, he introduced a Coercion Bill in the House of Commons, to deal with the growth of the Land League, and in the course of his speech declared it to be &quot;the most painful duty&quot; he had ever had to perform. The bill passed, among its provisions being one enabling the Irish government to arrest without trial persons &quot;reasonably suspected&quot; of crime and conspiracy.
The Irish Party used every opportunity to oppose the act, and Forster was kept constantly on the move between Dublin and London, conducting his campaign and defending it in the House of Commons.
He was nicknamed &quot;Buckshot&quot; by the Nationalist press, on the supposition that he had ordered its use by the police when firing on a crowd. On 13 October 1881, Charles Stewart Parnell was arrested, and soon after the Land League was suppressed. From that time Forster&#x27;s life was in danger, and he had to be escorted by mounted police in Dublin. In speeches given across Ireland in early 1882, Forster, while criticizing the populace for not helping the government, nonetheless pledged that it was the government&#x27;s duty to protect them. The danger to his life became more apparent, and several plans to murder him were frustrated by the merest accidents. On 2 May 1882, Gladstone announced that the government intended to release Parnell and his fellow-prisoners from Kilmainham Gaol, and that both Lord Cowper-Temple and Forster had in consequence resigned; on the following Saturday, Forster&#x27;s successor, Lord Frederick Cavendish, was murdered in Phoenix Park, Dublin. Still, Forster offered to return to Dublin temporarily as chief secretary, but the offer was declined. In the ensuing parliamentary session, he charged Parnell with conspiring in the murders, to be in turn denounced by Parnell.

During the remaining years of his life, Forster&#x27;s political record covered various interesting subjects, but his efforts in Ireland threw them all into shadow. He was at variance with Gladstone&#x27;s Liberalism, for example in policies towards Sudan and Transvaal. When the constituency of Bradford was divided into three, he was returned for the central division but did not take up his seat.

Forster died in 1886, on the eve of the introduction of the First Home Rule Bill, which he opposed. He was buried in Burley-in-Wharfedale.

==In popular culture==
Forster is referred to as &#x27;Buckshot&#x27; in the Irish folk song &quot;Monto&quot; made famous by The Dubliners and in Andy Irvine&#x27;s song &quot;Forgotten Hero&quot; about Michael Davitt.

<doc id="213409" wikidata="Q162620" url="?curid=213409" title="Provinces of Spain">
<text>A province in Spain is a territorial division defined as a collection of municipalities. The current provinces of Spain correspond by and large to the provinces created under the purview of the 1833 territorial re-organization of Spain, with a similar predecessor from 1822 (during the Trienio Liberal) and an earlier precedent in the 1810 Napoleonic division of Spain into 84 prefectures. There are many other groupings of municipalities that comprise the local government of Spain. 

The boundaries of provinces can only be altered by the Spanish Parliament, giving rise to the common view that the 17 autonomous communities are &quot;subdivided&quot; into 50 provinces. In reality the system is not hierarchical but defined according to jurisdiction (). 

The body charged with government and administration of a province is the Provincial council, but their existence is controversial. As the province is defined as a &quot;local entity&quot; in the Constitution, the Provincial council belongs to the sphere of local government.

== Provincial organization ==

The layout of Spain&#x27;s provinces closely follows the pattern of the territorial division of the country carried out in 1833. The only major change of provincial borders since that time has been the division of the Province of Canary Islands into the provinces of Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

Historically, the provinces served mainly as transmission belts for policies enacted in Madrid, as Spain was a highly centralised state for most of its modern history. The provinces were the &quot;building-blocks&quot; from which the autonomous communities were created following processed defined in the 1978 Constitution. Consequently, no province is divided between these communities.

The importance of the provinces has declined since the adoption of the system of autonomous communities in the period of the Spanish transition to democracy. They nevertheless remain electoral districts for national elections.

Provinces are also used as geographical references: for instance in postal addresses and telephone codes. National media will also frequently use the province to disambiguate small towns or communities whose names occur frequently throughout Spain. A small town would normally be identified as being in, say, Valladolid province rather than the autonomous community of Castile and León. In addition, organisations outside Spain use provinces for statistical analysis and policy making and in comparison with other countries including NUTS, OECD, FIPS, CIA World Factbook, ISO 3166-2 and the UN&#x27;s Second Administrative Level Boundaries data set project (SALB).

Most of the provinces are named after their capital town —with the exceptions of Álava, Asturias, Biscay, Cantabria, Gipuzkoa, the Balearic Islands, La Rioja, and Navarre, and a name reduction in Las Palmas and Castellón— and biggest town —with the exception of Pontevedra (Vigo), Asturias (Gijón) and Cádiz (Jerez). Only two capitals of autonomous communities—Mérida in Extremadura and Santiago de Compostela in Galicia—are not also the capitals of provinces.

Seven of the autonomous communities comprise no more than one province each: Asturias, the Balearic Islands, Cantabria, La Rioja, Madrid, Murcia, and Navarre. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;uniprovincial&quot; communities. Ceuta, Melilla, and the plazas de soberanía are not part of any province.

The table below lists the provinces of Spain. For each, the capital city is given, together with an indication of the autonomous community to which it belongs and a link to a list of municipalities in the province. The names of the provinces and their capitals are ordered alphabetically according to the form in which they appear in the main Wikipedia articles describing them. Unless otherwise indicated, their Spanish-language names are the same; locally valid names in Spain&#x27;s other co-official languages (Basque, Catalan, which is officially called Valencian in the Valencian Community, Galician) are also indicated where they differ.

<doc id="213413" wikidata="Q1056853" url="?curid=213413" title="In the Mood for Love">
<text>In the Mood for Love () is a 2000 romantic drama film written, directed and produced by Wong Kar-wai. A co-production between Hong Kong and France, it portrays a man (Tony Leung) and a woman (Maggie Cheung) in 1962 whose spouses have an affair together and who slowly develop feelings for each other. It forms the second part of an informal trilogy, alongside &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; and &quot;2046&quot;.

The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 20 May 2000, to critical acclaim and a nomination for the ; Leung won Best Actor (the first Hong Kong actor to win the award). It was selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 73rd Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. It is often listed as one of the greatest films of all time and one of the major works of Asian cinema.

==Plot==
In 1962 British Hong Kong, Shanghainese expatriates Chow Mo-wan, a journalist, and Su Li-zhen (Mrs. Chan), a secretary at a shipping company, rent rooms in adjacent apartments. Each has a spouse who works and often leaves them alone on overtime shifts. Due to the friendly but overbearing presence of Su&#x27;s Shanghainese landlady, Mrs. Suen, and their bustling, mahjong-playing neighbours, Chow and Su are often alone in their rooms and rarely dine with the other tenants. Although they initially are friendly to each other only as need be, they grow closer as they realize that their spouses are having an affair with each other, and subsequently try to reenact how the affair might have begun.

Chow invites Su to help him write a martial arts serial. Their increased time together draws the attention of their neighbors, leading Chow to rent a hotel room where they can work together undistracted. As time passes, they acknowledge that they have developed feelings for each other. When Chow takes a job in Singapore, he asks Su to go with him. She agrees but arrives at the hotel too late to accompany him.

The next year, in Singapore, Chow relays a story to his friend about how in older times, when a person had a secret, they would go atop a mountain, make a hollow in a tree, and whisper it into the hollow and cover it with mud. Su arrives at Singapore and visits Chow&#x27;s apartment. She calls Chow but remains silent when Chow picks up the phone. Later, Chow realizes she had visited his apartment after seeing a lipstick-stained cigarette butt in his ashtray.

Three years later, Su visits Mrs. Suen, who is about to emigrate to the United States, and inquires about whether her apartment is available for rent. Sometime later, Chow returns to Hong Kong to visit his former landlords the Koos, who have emigrated to the Philippines. He asks about the Suen family next door, and the new owner tells him a woman and her son are now living there. Chow leaves.

During the Vietnam War, Chow travels to Cambodia and visits Angkor Wat. As a monk watches him, Chow whispers something into a hollow in a wall and plugs it with mud.

==Title==
The film&#x27;s original Chinese title, meaning &quot;the age of blossoms&quot; or &quot;the flowery years&quot; – a Chinese metaphor for the fleeting time of youth, beauty and love – derives from a song of the same name by Zhou Xuan from a 1946 film. The English title derives from the song &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love&quot;. Director Wong had planned to name the film &quot;Secrets&quot; until listening to the song late in post-production.

==Production==
===Development and pre-production===
&quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; went through a long gestation period. In the 1990s, Wong Kar-wai found some commercial success, much critical acclaim, and wide influence on other filmmakers throughout Asia and the world with films such as &quot;Chungking Express&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;, both set in present-day Hong Kong. His 1997 film &quot;Happy Together&quot; was also successful internationally, winning him Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival and surprising many. It was even popular with mainstream audiences in Hong Kong, despite its then-unusual focus on a gay love story and its having been largely improvised in Argentina, a landscape unfamiliar to Wong. By the end of the decade, with sovereignty of Hong Kong transferred from Britain to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Wong was eager to work once more in the mainland, where he had been born. He had been dissatisfied with the final result of his 1994 wuxia epic &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;, which was set in ancient times and filmed in remote desert regions, and decided to deal with a more 20th-century, urban setting.

By 1998, Wong had developed a concept for his next film &quot;Summer in Beijing&quot;. Although no script was finalized, he and cameraman Christopher Doyle had been to Tiananmen Square and other areas of the city to do a small amount of unauthorized shooting. Wong told journalists the film was to be a musical and a love story. Wong secured the participation of Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Maggie Cheung to star, and with his background in graphic design, had even made posters for the film. He had begun work on script treatments, which since &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;, he tended to treat as only a very loose basis for his work to secure financing, preferring to leave things open to change during the shoot.

It transpired that there would be difficulties securing permission to shoot in Beijing with Wong&#x27;s spontaneous methods of working and potential political sensitivities in setting his film in mid-20th century China. Wong had come to think of &quot;Summer in Beijing&quot; as a triptych of stories, much like his original concept of &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (in which the third story had been spun off into the film &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;). Quickly, Wong decided to jettison this structure, saving only one of the three planned stories, which had been titled provisionally, &quot;A Story of Food&quot;, and dealt with a woman and a man who shared noodles and secrets. As he reunited with his actors and production team, most of whom had collaborated several times before, Wong decided &quot;A Story of Food&quot; would be the heart of his next film. The story would slowly evolve into &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;, after transposing its setting away from mainland China and back to 1960s Hong Kong.

Wong had set his breakthrough &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; in that time in Hong Kong, when mainland-born Chinese and their memories, including those of Wong, then a young child, had a strong presence in the territory. Still saturated with the sounds of 1930s and 1940s Shanghai singing stars and the ideals they represented, the time also reminded him of the wide array of vibrant dance music floating in over the Pacific from the Philippines, Hawaii, Latin America and the United States, which Wong had used as a backdrop in &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;. Wong had regarded &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; upon its release in 1990 as an artistic success, and had planned a sequel to it. However, his producers had been disappointed by its box-office returns, particularly given that its shoot had been prolonged and expensive, with Wong, who had come out of the Hong Kong industry, first attempting to work more independently, including collaborating for the first time with cinematographer Christopher Doyle, who favored jazz-like spontaneity in his shooting methods. Despite involving many of Hong Kong&#x27;s top stars, the film&#x27;s profits had been modest, so Wong was not given the opportunity to follow it up. Yet as he moved on to other films, he had always retained the dream of doing so. With the impossibility of the original idea of &quot;Summer in Beijing&quot;, he was now able to pursue it.

The cast of Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung in &quot;A Story of Food&quot; (soon to become &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;) provided an opportunity to pick up a loose thread of &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;, as the actors had appeared in that film, although never together. Leung&#x27;s few scenes had been left incomplete, awaiting Wong&#x27;s planned sequel that was never made. &quot;2046&quot;, a sequel in its plot to &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;, would later serve for Wong as a sequel in spirit to &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;, connecting the story of Leung&#x27;s character in &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;In the Mood&quot;. The writing of &quot;2046&quot; essentially began at the same time as that of &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;. Because neither film had its plot, structure, or even all its characters, scripted in advance, Wong began working on the ideas that eventually made it into &quot;2046&quot; during the shoot of &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;. As he and his collaborators made the film in a variety of settings, its story took shape. Eventually, these constantly developing ideas, taken from one of the remnants of &quot;Summer in Beijing&quot;, were developed too much to fit into one film. Wong discarded most of the footage and story before arriving at &quot;In the Mood&quot;, later reshooting and reimagining the rest as &quot;2046&quot;.

===Filming===
Wong&#x27;s plan to make a film set primarily in Hong Kong did not simplify matters when it came to the shoot. The city&#x27;s appearance was much changed since the 1960s, and Wong&#x27;s personal nostalgia for the time added to his desire for historical accuracy. Wong had little taste for working in studio settings, let alone using special effects to imitate the look of past times. Christopher Doyle later discussed the necessity of filming where the streets, the buildings, and even the sight of clothes hanging on lines (as in 1960s Hong Kong) could give a real energy to the actors and the story, whose outlines were constantly open to revision as shooting progressed. While set in Hong Kong, a portion of the filming (like outdoor and hotel scenes) was shot in less modernized neighborhoods of Bangkok, Thailand. Further, a brief portion later in the film is set in Singapore (one of Wong&#x27;s initial inspirations on the story had been a short story set in Hong Kong, &quot;Intersection&quot;, by the Hong Kong writer Liu Yichang). In its final sequences, the film also incorporates footage of Angkor Wat, Cambodia, where Leung&#x27;s character is working as a journalist.

The film took 15 months to shoot. The actors found the process inspiring but demanding. They required a lot of work to understand the times, being slightly younger than Wong and having grown up in a rapidly changing Hong Kong or, in Maggie Cheung&#x27;s case, partly in the United Kingdom.

Cheung portrayed 1930s Chinese screen icon Ruan Lingyu in Stanley Kwan&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Center Stage&quot;, for which she wore qipao, the dresses worn by stylish Chinese women throughout much of the first half of the 20th century. It had been Cheung&#x27;s most recognized performance to date and her hardest, partly due to the clothing, which restricted her freedom of movement. For Wong&#x27;s film, Cheung, playing a married woman in her thirties who had carried over the elegance of her younger years in the pre-revolutionary mainland, would again wear qipao, known in Cantonese as cheongsam, and spoke of it as the way of understanding her character Su Li-zhen, whose quiet strength Cheung felt was unlike her own more spontaneous spirit.

The cinematographer Christopher Doyle, for whom the film was the sixth collaboration with Wong Kar-wai, had to leave when production went over schedule and was replaced by Mark Lee Ping Bin, renowned for his work with Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao-hsien. Both DPs are credited equally for the final film. Some scenes in the final cut are thought to have been shot by each, with some critics noting differences between Doyle&#x27;s more kinetic style as seen in earlier Wong movies, and the more subtle long shots of Lee framing key parts of &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;.

Critic Tony Rayns, on the other hand, noted in a commentary on another Wong film that the differing styles of the two cinematographers were blended seamlessly by Wong&#x27;s own fluid aesthetic. Like all of Wong&#x27;s previous work, this one was shot on film, not digitally.

Doyle&#x27;s departure did not result from major artistic arguments with Wong. However, despite his agreement with Wong&#x27;s spontaneous approach to scripting, he found it frustrating to reshoot many of the key moments over and over in environments throughout Southeast Asia until they felt right to the director. He had to turn down many other projects due to the total commitment, without a clear time limit, required by Wong. Several years later Doyle initially signed on to work on the sequel &quot;2046&quot;, but he also abandoned that project halfway through for similar reasons (being replaced by a range of DPs) and has not worked with Wong since. Tony Leung, on the other hand, returned to work on &quot;2046&quot;, in which he starred without Maggie Cheung, who made only a brief appearance in already shot footage from &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;. Leung also starred in Wong&#x27;s 2013 film, &quot;The Grandmaster&quot;. Cheung felt &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; was the high point of her career, and she has worked much more infrequently since, starring in several films soon after but within four years, all but retired from acting, despite winning a Best Actress Award at Cannes for 2004&#x27;s &quot;Clean&quot;.

===Post-production===
The final months of production and post-production on &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;, a submission to the Cannes Film Festival in May 2000, were notorious for their confusion. The film was barely finished in time for the festival, as would occur again four years later when Wong submitted &quot;2046&quot;. Wong continued shooting more and more of &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; with the cast and crew as he worked furiously to edit the massive amounts of footage he had shot over the past year. He removed large chunks of the story to strip it down to its most basic element, the relationship between these characters in the 1960s, with brief allusions to earlier and later times. In the meantime, Wong screened brief segments before the festival for journalists and distributors. Despite the general lack of commercial interest in Chinese cinema at the time by North American media corporations, Wong was given a distribution deal for a limited theatrical release in North America on USA Films, based only on a few minutes of footage.

By early 2000, with the deadline for Cannes approaching, Wong was contacted by the director of Cannes, who encouraged him to quickly complete a final cut, and offered a constructive criticism about the title. Although the title in Cantonese and Mandarin is based on a Zhou Xuan song whose English title is translated &quot;Age of Bloom&quot;, the international title proved more complex. After discarding &quot;Summer in Beijing&quot; and &quot;A Story of Food&quot;, Wong had provisionally settled on &quot;Secrets&quot;, but Cannes felt this title was not as distinctive as the film Wong was preparing and suggested he should change it.

Finally having completed the cut, but at a loss for titles, Wong was listening to a then-recent album by Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music titled &quot;Slave to Love: The Very Best of the Ballads&quot;, and noticed a resonance in the song &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love&quot;, which shared its title with a popular jazz standard of the mid-20th century. Many of Wong&#x27;s previous English-language titles had come from pop songs, so he found this title particularly appropriate.

Wong states he was influenced by Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; while making this film and compares Tony Leung&#x27;s character to James Stewart&#x27;s:

==Music==
===Title song===
The title track &quot;Hua Yang De Nian Hua&quot; is a song by famous singer Zhou Xuan from the Solitary Island period. The 1946 song is a paean to a happy past and an oblique metaphor for the darkness of Japanese-occupied Shanghai. Wong also set the song to his 2000 short film, named &quot;Hua Yang De Nian Hua&quot;, after the track.

===Soundtrack===
* Shigeru Umebayashi: &quot;Yumeji&#x27;s Theme&quot; (originally from the soundtrack of Seijun Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;Yumeji&quot;)
* Michael Galasso: &quot;Angkor Wat Theme&quot;, &quot;ITMFL&quot;, &quot;Casanova/Flute&quot;
* Nat King Cole: &quot;Aquellos Ojos Verdes&quot;, &quot;Te Quiero Dijiste&quot;, &quot;Quizás, Quizás, Quizás&quot;
* Bryan Ferry: &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love&quot; (the inspiration for the English title, found on, e.g., the French two-CD soundtrack, not in the film)
* Zhou Xuan:《花樣的年華》 &quot;Hua Yang De Nian Hua&quot; (the inspiration for the original Chinese title)
* Rebecca Pan: &quot;Bengawan Solo&quot;
* All of the traditional &quot;pingtan&quot;, Cantonese, Beijing and Yue operas are historic recordings

==Release==
&quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the . It was theatrically released in Hong Kong on 29 September 2000.

===Restorations===
In 2020, a 4K restoration from the original film negatives was performed by the Criterion Collection and L&#x27;Immagine Ritrovata under the supervision of Wong Kar-wai. The restoration was scheduled to premiere at the 73rd Cannes Film Festival in May 2020, followed by a limited theatrical re-release, but was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cannes postponed the showing to October 2020, with the film playing at the Lumière Festival in Lyon instead. A planned release in June 2020 at the Lincoln Center in New York was also rescheduled, with the restoration playing virtually in November 2020.

For its 25th anniversary, the film received a new 4K remaster that featured 9 minutes of previously unreleased footage. It was released in theaters on 14 February 2025 (Valentine&#x27;s Day) in China in regular and IMAX formats.

===Digital and home media===
The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray, most notably by Criterion, who released a restored high-definition digital transfer in the United States in 2012. Criterion again restored eight of Wong&#x27;s films in 2020 in a process supervised by the director; controversially, the new versions changed the aspect ratio, color grading, and voiceover of some of the films, including &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;. Wong explained his decision by saying, &quot;I invite the audience to join me in starting afresh, as these are not the same films, and we are no longer the same audience.&quot;

In 2021, Wong released a 92-second NFT short film titled &quot;In the Mood for Love — Day One&quot;. It was composed of unused footage shot on the film&#x27;s first day of production, featuring an alternate storyline and Leung and Cheung playing different characters. It was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s, along with memorabilia from his other films.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; made HK$8,663,227 during its Hong Kong run.

On 2 February 2001, the film opened in six North American theatres, earning $113,280 ($18,880 per screen) in its first weekend. It finished its North American run with a gross of $2,738,980. An archival footage featuring a montage of images from vintage Chinese movies is also featured in the DVD collection.

The total worldwide box office gross was US$12,854,953.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 187 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;An exquisitely shot showcase for Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung that marks a somber evolution of Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s chic style, &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; is a tantric tease that&#x27;s liable to break your heart.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100 based on 28 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, calling it &quot;a lush story of unrequited love&quot;. Elvis Mitchell, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, referred to it as &quot;probably the most breathtakingly gorgeous film of the year&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;in the hands of a hack, &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; could have been a snickering sex farce. In the hands of Wong Kar-wai ... the film is alive with delicacy and feeling&quot;. Peter Walker of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, describing it as his &quot;favourite film&quot;, wrote that it provides &quot;profound and moving reflections on life&#x27;s fundamentals. It&#x27;s a film about, yes, love; but also betrayal, loss, missed opportunities, memory, the brutality of time&#x27;s passage, loneliness—the list goes on&quot;. David Parkinson of &quot;Empire&quot; awarded the film five out of five stars, writing that &quot;the performances are masterly, and the photography beautiful. It&#x27;s a genuinely romantic romance and makes for sublime cinema&quot;.

==Influence==
&quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; has been called &quot;era-defining...[evoking] glamour with a streak of grittiness, and the feeling of being adrift,&quot; impacting popular culture broadly, including fashion and social media. A wide range of filmmakers have taken inspiration from the film, such as Sofia Coppola and Barry Jenkins, crediting it as a great film and a major influence on their own work.

Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s aesthetic style has been referenced directly in films as well. The director duo Daniels paid homage to the style of &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; in the multiverse film &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;.

===Lists===
In 2000, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it number 42 in its list titled &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot;. It was ranked 95th on 100 Best Films from 1983 to 2008 by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. In November 2009, &quot;Time Out New York&quot; ranked the film as the fifth-best of the decade, calling it the &quot;consummate unconsummated love story of the new millennium&quot;.

In the 2022 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics poll, &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; appeared at number 5, making it the highest ranked film from the 2000s and one of only two from the 2000s to be listed in the top 10 of all time, along with David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. Wong&#x27;s film was also the highest ranked film by a Chinese filmmaker. The film owed its placement to the votes of 42 critics (out of 846) who placed it in their own individual top 10 lists.

In 2015, the Busan International Film Festival ranked the film No. 3 in its Asian Cinema 100 list, behind Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; and Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot;.

In 2016, the film appeared in second place on BBC&#x27;s list of 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century after &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. The film ranked 9th in BBC&#x27;s 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films voted by 209 film critics from 43 countries around the world.

In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the film fifth in its Best Films of the 21st Century list. In 2021 the film was ranked at No. 8 on &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 best movies of all time&quot;.

In 2022, &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; ranked the film 5th on its &quot;Greatest Films of All Time&quot; critics&#x27; poll.

<doc id="213416" wikidata="Q1146296" url="?curid=213416" title="The Replacements (film)">
<text>The Replacements is a 2000 sports comedy film directed by Howard Deutch and starring Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Orlando Jones, Brooke Langton, Rhys Ifans, Jon Favreau, and Jack Warden in his last film appearance before his death in 2006.

The movie was loosely based on the 1987 NFL strike, specifically the Washington Redskins, who won all three replacement games without any of their regular players and went on to win Super Bowl XXII. Though the film is a story of the replacement players, the Falco–Martel quarterback controversy is quite similar to the one in the post-strike Washington controversy between Doug Williams and Jay Schroeder. Hackman narrated the episode of NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Game: The Super Bowl Champions&quot; devoted to that team.

==Plot==
An unnamed (fictional) professional football league is hit with a players&#x27; strike with four games left in the season. Washington Sentinels owner Edward O&#x27;Neil calls a former coach of his, Jimmy McGinty, telling him that the league&#x27;s going to finish the regular season with replacement players, and asks McGinty to return to coach the Sentinels the rest of the season, adding that winning three of the last four games will get the Sentinels into the playoffs. McGinty accepts on the condition that he can sign the players he wants without O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s interference.

McGinty pulls together players of varying talents who he believes can make an entertaining, if not winning, team. For quarterback, McGinty chooses Shane Falco, a former All-American from Ohio State whose career went to pieces after a lopsided Sugar Bowl loss; he now lives on a houseboat in a D.C. marina and makes a living doing hull maintenance on private yachts. Falco initially refuses, but McGinty persuades him, believing that Falco can still become the player he was meant to be. The striking players greet the replacement players at their first practice with hostility, calling them &quot;scabs&quot; and throwing eggs at them; Falco, who arrives late, gets his truck overturned. Head cheerleader Annabelle Farrell, who has to find new cheerleaders since the originals apparently walked out in sympathy with the players, hires strippers when the other tryouts go badly. After practice, she drives Falco home and surprises him with her vast football knowledge.

The replacements&#x27; first game is against Detroit, and the team struggles to get along. Falco tries to rally them, but on the last play, he falters when he sees a pending blitz and calls an audible, which falls short of the winning touchdown. McGinty berates Falco, telling him, &quot;winners always want the ball when the game&#x27;s on the line.&quot; At a local bar, the replacements are brooding over their loss when some of the striking players, led by their prima donna quarterback Eddie Martel, arrive and taunt them. Falco stands up to Martel, a brawl ensues, and the replacements are arrested. In jail they bond, dancing together to the Gloria Gaynor song &quot;I Will Survive&quot; in their cell before McGinty bails them out. Farrell meets Falco the next day and tells him that he&#x27;s the first quarterback she&#x27;s seen in a long time who cares more for his teammates than himself, and a connection starts to grow between them.

The next day, in a &quot;chalk talk&quot;, when McGinty asks the players what their fears are, they begin to realize they&#x27;re all afraid of failing in their second chance at football. McGinty inspires the team to use their shared fear as a source of strength. In the Sentinels&#x27; next game, against San Diego, they fall behind again but are able to come together and rally after a 65-yard field goal by their Welsh kicker, Nigel, winning the game 17–16. Falco meets Farrell at the bar she inherited from her father and now runs. After a short conversation and a beer, they share a deep kiss.

The Sentinels nearly lose their next game on the road against Phoenix, but win on a couple of improbable plays. When they return to D.C., O&#x27;Neil tells McGinty that Martel has crossed the picket line, as has the entire Dallas team—the league&#x27;s defending champion and the Sentinels&#x27; next opponent. O&#x27;Neil shows no confidence in Falco&#x27;s ability to beat Dallas, and hints to McGinty that he could be fired if he refuses to start Martel, reneging on the promise he&#x27;d given to McGinty to not interfere. McGinty gives in and tells Falco, saying that he has the &quot;heart&quot; Martel lacks. Falco then gives his teammates the news. While disheartened, they give him a farewell toast. Too downcast to face Farrell, he stands her up for the date they had planned.

In the first half of the Dallas game, Martel clashes severely with the replacement players, blames them for his own mistakes, and smugly ignores McGinty&#x27;s play calls. The Sentinels trail Dallas 17–0 at halftime. On the way to the locker room, McGinty tells a TV reporter that what the team needs to come back and win is &quot;miles and miles of heart&quot;. Seeing this on television, Falco returns to the stadium, and McGinty promptly benches Martel. The rest of the team throws Martel out of the locker room. Back on the field, Falco finds Farrell and apologizes to her, giving her another deep kiss.

McGinty tells the replacements that the strike will officially end the next day, encouraging them to give everything they have left. The Sentinels rally back to 17–14 with less than a minute left. Falco calls for a deep pass to the replacements&#x27; deaf tight end, Brian Murphy, and hits him with the game-winning touchdown pass as time expires, beating Dallas 20–17, and earning the Sentinels a playoff berth. McGinty narrates that the replacement players left the field with nothing but the satisfaction and personal glory of living the athlete&#x27;s dream of a &quot;second chance&quot;, as the replacements dance on the field to &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.

==Production==
Filming occurred in Baltimore, Maryland, making extensive use of PSINet Stadium (now known as M&amp;T Bank Stadium) The stadium was known as Nextel Stadium in the movie. The Domino Sugar plant plant is visible in some scenes shot in the Inner Harbor.

==Cast==
* Keanu Reeves as Shane Falco #16 (QB) — A left-handed former All-America quarterback for Ohio State who fell off the grid after choking in the 1996 Sugar Bowl and washing out of the pros after one season, giving him a derogatory nickname of &quot;Footsteps&quot;, because of his impulse to scramble prematurely when he thinks a sack is coming.
* Gene Hackman as Coach Jimmy McGinty — Former head coach of the Washington Sentinels. Once fired by O&#x27;Neil, he is asked back to coach the replacement players. Seeing this as an opportunity to put together his personal fantasy football team, McGinty offers his recruits a chance at glory and truly believes in his players. He&#x27;s old school in his belief that players should earn their keep, rather than expect things to be given to them.
* Brooke Langton as Annabelle Farrell — Head cheerleader for the Washington Sentinels and owner of a bar on 8th Street in Washington.
* Orlando Jones as Clifford Franklin #81 (WR) — A stockboy in a minimart who is fast but struggles catching the ball.
* Faizon Love as Jamal Abdul Jackson #72 (G) and Michael Taliferro as Andre Jackson #73 (G), the Jackson Brothers — Former offensive guards turned bodyguards for rapper ODB, who seem to excel only when they play on the same team. Both would have remained in the pros had they not fallen apart after one got traded.
* Rhys Ifans as Nigel Gruff #3 (K) — A Welsh footballer and pub owner, nicknamed &quot;The Leg&quot; because he can kick a football the entire length of the playing field. He smokes on the field and has a gambling addiction.
* Jon Favreau as Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Bateman #56 (MLB) — A reserved, almost reticent man during normal interaction with people, who goes completely berserk when placed in an adversarial situation. Linebacker and defensive captain. He was a walk on player at Michigan State and is a Gulf War veteran who received a Purple Heart. Member of the Washington D.C. Police SWAT team.
* Ace Yonamine as &quot;Jumbo&quot; Fumiko #68 (OT) — A Japanese sumo wrestler turned offensive tackle whose battle cry, &quot;Nan desu ka&quot; (&quot;What is this&quot;) becomes the team&#x27;s own.
* Troy Winbush as Walter Cochran #34 (RB) — An ordained minister who played one game in the pros and blew out his knee. He repeats this injury during his final game with the Sentinels after diving into the end zone for a touchdown.
* David Denman as Brian Murphy #86 (TE) — A tight end from Gallaudet University who was said by McGinty to have been a first-round pick if had he not been born deaf. He plays a major role in the team both on the field and off, scoring the game-winning touchdown and sparking the conversation that leads to a bar fight.
* Michael Jace as Earl Wilkinson aka &quot;Ray Smith&quot; #42 (CB) — A former star cornerback and kick returner from Minnesota, serving a prison sentence for assaulting a police officer. He&#x27;s allowed to play with the permission of the governor of Maryland under an alias.
* Gailard Sartain &amp; Art LaFleur as Coach Pilachowski and Coach Banes, respectively — McGinty&#x27;s coaching staff. Skeptical about the replacement players, they nevertheless follow McGinty&#x27;s recommendations and find ways to work with them.
* Brett Cullen as Eddie Martel #7 — Regular starting quarterback for the Washington Sentinels, two-time Super Bowl winner.
* Archie L. Harris Jr. as Wilson Carr (DL) – Regular starting defensive lineman for the Washington Sentinels, and the &quot;muscle&quot; of Martel&#x27;s clique of teammates. He joins Martel in crossing the picket line, and plays in the last game, with seemingly no more ill will towards the replacement players.
* Evan Dexter Parke as Malcolm LaMont (RB) – Regular starting running back for the Washington Sentinels, part of Martel&#x27;s clique of teammates.
* John Madden and Pat Summerall portray themselves, offering play-by-play and color commentary on the games.
* Jack Warden as Edward O&#x27;Neil — Owner of the Washington Sentinels. O&#x27;Neil is the epitome of the double-talking, manipulative businessman interested only in accolades and doesn&#x27;t think twice about reneging on a deal if it will earn him a more desirable result.
* Sarah Ann Morris as Heather and Caroline Keenan as Dawn — Two exotic dancers who try out to be Sentinels cheerleaders during the strike.
* Keith David as Lindell, the president of the players&#x27; union

<text>Dominguito del Val (&quot;c.&quot; 1243 – &quot;c.&quot; 1250) was a legendary child in medieval Spain, allegedly a choirboy ritually murdered by Jews in Zaragoza (Saragossa). Dominguito is the protagonist in one of the first blood libel in the history of Spain – stories that grew in prominence in the 12th and 13th centuries of the Middle Ages, and contributed to antisemitic incidents. According to the legend, Dominguito was ritually murdered by Jews of Zaragoza.

Saint Dominguito is no longer included on the official Roman Catholic liturgical calendar; however, there is still a chapel dedicated to him in the cathedral of Zaragoza. There exists little historical evidence of Dominguito aside from the stories and legends built around him.

==Dominguito&#x27;s legend==
The historical basis for Dominguito is unclear. No medieval references to the legend have been found; the first texts that recount the tale date from 1583, three hundred thirty-three years after the fact. The story appears to have been largely copied from the legend of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, collected by Fray Alonso de Espina. According to the accounts, Alfonso X of Castile wrote the original rendition of the story in 1250, saying: &quot;We have heard it said that some very cruel Jews, in memory of the Passion of Our Lord on Good Friday, kidnapped a Christian boy and crucified him.&quot;

According to the legend, Dominguito was born on 1243 in Zaragoza and was admitted as a cathedral altar-boy and chorister at La Seo because of his beautiful voice. He disappeared on 31 August 1250, when he was seven years old. Some months later, some boatmen discovered the decomposed corpse on the bank of Ebro river.

The story goes that one day on his way home the boy met a Jew by the name of Albayuceto, who deceived him and brought him to a house in the Jewish quarter, where he was nailed to a cross and tortured until he died. In an effort to dispose of the body, they beheaded him, cut off his feet and buried the corpse on the banks of the Ebro River.

The child&#x27;s bones were later interred in the cathedral, where in the chapel of Santo Dominguito del Val they are still revered as holy relics. Dominguito is still revered as a saint and celebrated in 31 August in the diocese of Zaragoza.

The story resembles others like the so-called &quot;Holy Child&quot; of La Guardia (inspired by a real inquisitorial process in 1491).

The story has similarities with other tales circulating in medieval Europe alleging the murder of a child at hands of Jews. These were symptomatic of the growing anti-Semitism in the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages it was very frequent that in the face of any misfortune -weather, droughts, etc.- the Jewish community was blamed. Often, these stories were used to rationalize imposing greater repressive measures against the Jews.

Tony Leung Chiu-wai (, born 27 June 1962) is a Hong Kong actor and singer. He is one of Asia&#x27;s most successful and internationally recognized actors. He has won many international acting prizes, including the Cannes Film Festival award for Best Actor for his performance in Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s film &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;. He was named by CNN as one of &quot;Asia&#x27;s 25 Greatest Actors of All Time&quot;.

Leung is known for his collaborations with director Wong Kar-wai, with whom he has worked in seven films, including &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (1994), &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1997), &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000), &quot;2046&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; (2013). He also appeared in three Venice Film Festival Golden Lion-winning films: &quot;A City of Sadness&quot; (1989), &quot;Cyclo&quot; (1995) and &quot;Lust, Caution&quot; (2007), directed by Ang Lee. Leung also starred in the Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Hero&quot; (2002), the cult classic &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; (1992), and box office hits &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; (2002) and &quot;Red Cliff&quot; (2008). He later came to prominence in Hollywood with his role in &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021).

Leung has an extensive list of awards that he has won in a career that began in the 1980s. For &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;, Leung earned the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival. He is also an eight-time winner at the Hong Kong Film Awards and three-time winner at the Golden Horse Film Awards, holding the record for most awards in the Best Actor category. The 2002 book &quot;East Asian Film Stars&quot; describes Leung as &quot;undoubtedly one of the most successful and widely-acclaimed Hong Kong actors of his generation, with a broad and diverse filmography.&quot; In 2023, he became the first male actor to win the &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, after winning Best Actor at the three most prestigious Chinese-language film awards: the Golden Horse Awards, the Hong Kong Film Awards and the Golden Rooster Awards.

==Early life==
Leung was born in Hong Kong to a family of Taishan, Guangdong ancestry. His early childhood was punctuated by his parents&#x27; quarrels and arguments about money. A mischievous boy in his early years, Leung changed after his father, a chronic gambler, left the family when he was eight; he and his younger sister were brought up by their mother.

Leung was a slightly reticent, quiet child. He has said that his childhood experiences paved the way for his acting career, which allows him to openly express his feelings:You don&#x27;t know what happened, just one day your pop disappears. And from that day on I try not to communicate with anyone. I&#x27;m so afraid to talk to my classmates, afraid that if someone says something about family I won&#x27;t know what to do. So I became very isolated. So that&#x27;s why I love acting, because I can express all my feelings the way I couldn&#x27;t for so long. I&#x27;m a quiet person. And then when I went to TV it all came out; I cried and I wasn&#x27;t ashamed. The audience thinks it&#x27;s the character&#x27;s feelings, but really it&#x27;s my feelings, all coming out in a rush.Leung went to Delia Memorial School (Broadway), but quit at age 15, in 1977, due to financial difficulties. He was very close to his mother. During an interview on the making of &quot;Hero&quot;, he said that he saw his mother as his definition of a hero for having brought up two children alone.

==Television career==

After quitting his studies, Leung worked in a variety of jobs, first as a grocer&#x27;s runner at his uncle&#x27;s shop, then a home appliance salesman in a Hong Kong shopping centre. Around the age of 16, he met future actor and comedian Stephen Chow, who influenced his decision to become an actor and remains a good friend.

In 1982, he graduated from television channel TVB&#x27;s acting class. Due to his boyish looks, TVB initially cast him as the host of a children&#x27;s programme, &quot;430 Space Shuttle,&quot; but soon moved him to drama roles, beginning with &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; (1982). He was quickly promoted to leading man status in primetime series, including &quot;The Duke of Mount Deer&quot; (1984) and &quot;New Heavenly Sword and Dragon Sabre&quot; (1986). Leung mostly enjoyed comedies during his television years; it was for these he became well known. In the 1980s, he was named one of &quot;TVB&#x27;s Five Tigers&quot; (their five popular young leading actors), along with Andy Lau, Felix Wong, Michael Miu and Kent Tong.

Leung starred in the popular &quot;Police Cadet&quot; TV serial in 1984 (later named &quot;Police Cadet 84&quot; to distinguish it from its two sequels). The series had an average viewership rating of 50% per episode during its original run. Leung played an outgoing young man who decides to become a police officer; Maggie Cheung, whose career started at the same time, played Leung&#x27;s upstairs neighbour and love interest. Since then they have worked together on &quot;The Yang&#x27;s Saga&quot; (1985), &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1991), &quot;The Eagle Shooting Heroes&quot; (1993), &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; (1994), &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000), &quot;Hero&quot; (2002), and &quot;2046&quot; (2005). Leung has said that he considers Cheung his alter ego, and that &quot;Maggie is a truly formidable partner—one to waltz with. We do not spend a lot of time with each other, as we like to keep some mystery between us. Whenever I see her, I discover something new about her&quot;.

After eight years with TVB, Leung left the network to focus on his film career. His final TV drama was &quot;Ode to Gallantry&quot; in 1989.

==Film career==

Many consider Leung to be the most acclaimed contemporary actor in Greater China. He first garnered international attention in Hou Hsiao-hsien&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;A City of Sadness&quot;, which won the Venice Golden Lion. Before that he was already known in Hong Kong for his TV shows and films in the mid-1980s.

Leung&#x27;s initial transition from television to film in the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s is considered a low period in his career. He had won two HKFA Best Supporting Actor awards in quick succession but was struggling to establish himself as a leading man on the big screen. In 1992, when he was nominated for a third time in the Supporting Actor category for &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;, Leung refused the nomination on the grounds that he had a leading role in the film. His protest was supported by director John Woo and co-star Chow Yun-fat. This later led the Hong Kong Film Awards to change its nomination rules to allow for multiple leading roles from the same film. Leung has also said that until &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1990), he had lost interest in acting and considered quitting, but working with Wong Kar-wai and seeing his scene in the final film changed his mind. His career entered a new chapter when he won dual Best Actor awards at the Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards for &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (1994), becoming only the second actor to do so after Danny Lee in 1984. He repeated the feat with &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; in 2003. Beginning with &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, Leung has picked up six Best Actor wins at the Hong Kong Film Awards, three Best Actor awards at the Golden Horse Awards, as well as a Best Actor prize at Cannes. In 2023, with his win of the Golden Rooster Award for Best Actor for &quot;Hidden Blade&quot;, he also became the first person to receive the Best Actor award from all three major Chinese movie awards.
Leung often collaborates with Wong Kar-wai and has appeared in many of his films. His roles include the lonely policeman in &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (1994), a gay Chinese expatriate living in Argentina in &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1997), and a self-controlled victim of adultery in &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000), for which he won the Best Actor award at Cannes. He reprised his role from &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; as a new Chow Mo-wan in &quot;2046&quot; (2004) and trained in Wing Chun for five years to prepare for his role as Ip Man in Wong&#x27;s &quot;The Grandmaster.&quot; Wong&#x27;s Jet Tone Film Production was also Leung&#x27;s management agency for many years until 2018.

In addition to his works with Wong, Leung has starred in three Venice Golden Lion winning films: &quot;A City of Sadness&quot; (1989), &quot;Cyclo&quot; (1995) and &quot;Lust, Caution&quot; (2007), cementing his reputation in the arthouse cinema world. He also became the first Chinese actor to receive the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the Venice Film Festival. In 2014, he was a member of the jury of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, and in 2017 he was invited to become a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2022, Leung was named the Asian Filmmaker of the Year at the 27th Busan International Film Festival. Robert De Niro and Brad Pitt are admirers of his work, and &quot;The Times&quot; has called Leung Asia&#x27;s answer to Clark Gable. He has also been compared to Cary Grant, or a combination of several A-list Hollywood stars.

Leung is widely believed to be a method actor. He has said that he often has trouble separating the characters from himself, beginning with his early TV roles. He usually takes long breaks after filming to recover from psychologically taxing roles, and remnants of the characters still remain within him years later. He has said that the voice of his wife Carina Lau can bring him back to reality.

Leung admits that he has a tendency to stay in his comfort zone and work with familiar teams and filmmakers. Over the course of his career, he has worked with Wong Kar-wai eight times (including &quot;See You Tomorrow,&quot; which Wong wrote), three times with John Woo, three times with Derek Yee, and twice with Hou Hsiao-hsien. He has also worked with the creators of &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; (Andrew Lau, Alan Mak, Felix Chong) on three other films: &quot;Confession of Pain&quot; (2006), &quot;The Silent War&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Goldfinger&quot; (2023). In recent years, Leung has become more adventurous and willing to try new things; this includes collaborating with new directors and taking on his first Hollywood role.

In an interview with &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot; in 2001, Leung said that he had no plans to make a Hollywood debut, but would consider it for the right project. He said, &quot;I have many more choices on the character I can play (in Hong Kong). The role for Asian actors and actresses is very restrictive in Hollywood movies.&quot; Actors such as Chow Yun-fat and Jet Li had then made their own debuts in the 1990s. In 2005, he signed with an American agent with the intention to appear in a Hollywood film. Producer Kevin Feige announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con that Leung will join the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the villain in &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,&quot; marking his Hollywood debut&quot;.&quot; Leung&#x27;s character Wenwu is a composite character of Fu Manchu and the Mandarin. The movie was released in 2021 and his performance was universally praised.

Leung also had a successful Cantopop and Mandarin pop singing career in the 1990s, which he abandoned to focus on acting. He still occasionally sings for his films; the theme song of &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; which he performed with Andy Lau is one of the Top 10 Song of 2003 and won the 22nd Hong Kong Film Awards&#x27; Best Original Film Song.

During the promotion of the film &quot;Hero&quot;, some commentators in Hong Kong alleged that Leung expressed the view that the Tiananmen Square demonstration crackdown was necessary to maintain stability. Leung made a single comment in response that he may have been misquoted and his statement taken out of context.

Leung speaks Cantonese, English and Mandarin. &quot;Lust, Caution&quot; (2007) is the first film where he used his own voice in a Mandarin-speaking role (his dialogue in &quot;Hero&quot; is dubbed) and &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021) is his first English-speaking role, despite being fluent in the language.

In 2023, Leung starred in the World War II spy thriller &quot;Hidden Blade&quot;, directed by Cheng Er&quot;,&quot; and the crime drama &quot;The Goldfinger,&quot; along with Andy Lau&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Goldfinger&quot; is the duo&#x27;s first collaboration since &quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot; in 2003. He also made a cameo appearance in the music video for NewJeans&#x27;s &quot;Cool With You&quot;.

Next, Leung plans to make his first European film, &quot;Silent Friend&quot;, with Hungarian filmmaker Ildikó Enyedi.

==Personal life==
=== Relationships ===
Leung publicly dated fellow TVB actress Margie Tsang in an on-again, off-again relationship from 1982 to 1988. In 1986, during one of their breakups, Leung briefly dated Kitty Lai, his co-star at the time in &quot;New Heavenly Sword and Dragon Sabre&quot;, before getting back together with Tsang. Leung and Tsang broke up permanently in 1988 and he has been in a relationship with Carina Lau since 1989.

==== Carina Lau ====

Leung and Carina Lau are one of Hong Kong&#x27;s most prominent celebrity couples. They began their romantic relationship in 1989 after working together on a Hong Kong production of &quot;Run For Your Wife&quot; and dated for 19 years before marrying in Bhutan in 2008. They had known each other since &quot;The Clones&quot; in 1984, and also co-starred together in &quot;Duke of Mount Deer&quot; (1984), &quot;Police Cadet&quot; (1984, 1985, 1988), &quot;The Yangs&#x27; Saga&quot; (1985), &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1991), &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Father&quot; (1993), &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; (1994), and &quot;2046&quot; (2005).

In 1990, during the filming of &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;, Lau was abducted for several hours. Leung dropped out of the film to spend more time with her. Wong Kar-wai said, &quot;Originally, there were plans for &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; I and II, and the sequence featuring Leung was meant to be the opening scene of the second movie. But two things happened, one of which was that &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; didn&#x27;t do well in Hong Kong, so the producers said, &#x27;No Part 2.&#x27; The other reason was Lau&#x27;s kidnapping.&quot;

On 21 July 2008, the couple married in Bhutan. The wedding ceremony was directed by Wong Kar-wai and attended by numerous celebrities including Faye Wong, Li Yapeng, Bridgitte Lin, Cecilia Yip, Ti Lung and Chang Chen. The event gained significant media attention in Hong Kong, with media companies spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to cover the wedding party.

According to &quot;Ming Pao Daily News&quot;, Faye Wong and Li Yapeng had taken the couple to India in 2007 to visit the 17th Karmapa. The Karmapa&#x27;s counsel helped them resolve a crisis in their relationship, and he also suggested Bhutan as a wedding venue.

===Religion===
Leung is a Buddhist. He has donated to constructions of Buddhist institutions, performed his marriage in a Buddhist ceremony, attends Buddhist gatherings, and had been seen doing Buddhist palm greetings. He appeared pro bono in the Bhutanese Buddhist film &quot;Hema Hema: Sing Me a Song While I Wait&quot; (2016)&quot;.&quot; In 2016, he was seen at a ceremony in India that was also attended by members of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which upset Chinese officials.

<text>The black-headed jay or lanceolated jay (Garrulus lanceolatus) is roughly the same size as its close relative the Eurasian jay, but a little more slender overall except for the bill which is slightly shorter and thicker. The top of the head is black and it has a more obvious crest too and a longer tail.

It ranges from eastern Afghanistan eastwards, across the Himalayas, from India to Nepal and Bhutan. It occurs in wooded country with large areas of open ground rather than dense forest. It also occurs in some cultivated areas and even near villages as long as there are enough trees and scrubland nearby.

It feeds both on the ground and in trees, and takes virtually the same wide range of plant and animal foods as its close relative, including eggs and nestlings, as well as scraps near human habitation.

It nests in trees and suitable bushes and in this resembles the Eurasian jay in every respect. their nests are made of sticks plastered together with mud and lined with weeds and rootlets. There are usually 3–5 eggs incubated over 16 days. Both parents feed the young.

The voice is very similar to the Eurasian jay&#x27;s and is most often a loud screech but with longer pauses between.

<doc id="213429" wikidata="Q3924795" url="?curid=213429" title="Accentor">
<text>The accentors are a genus of birds in the family Prunellidae, which is endemic to the Old World. This small group of closely related passerines are all in the genus Prunella. All but the dunnock and the Japanese accentor are inhabitants of the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia; these two also occur in lowland areas, as does the Siberian accentor in the far north of Siberia. These birds are not strongly migratory, but they will leave the coldest parts of their range in winter and make altitudinal movements.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The genus &quot;Prunella&quot; was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1816 with the dunnock (&quot;Prunella modularis&quot;) as the type species. Although the genus is usually used for all the accentors, the alpine accentor and Altai accentor are sometimes separated into the genus &quot;Laiscopus&quot;.

Harrison used the group name dunnock for all of the species, not just &quot;Prunella modularis&quot; (thus e.g. Japanese dunnock for &quot;P. rubida&quot;); this usage is based on the oldest known name for any of the species (old English &quot;dun&quot;-, brown, + -&quot;ock&quot;, small: &quot;little brown bird&quot;). &quot;Accentor&quot; derives from the old scientific name for the Alpine accentor (&quot;Accentor collaris&quot;). It comes from Late Latin, meaning &quot;sing with another&quot; (ad + cantor). The genus name &quot;Prunella&quot; is from the German &quot;Braunelle&quot;, &quot;dunnock&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;braun&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;.

==Description==
These are small, fairly drab species superficially similar, but not closely related to, sparrows. They are 14 to 18 cm in length, and weigh between 25 and 35 g. However, accentors have thin sharp bills, reflecting their diet of ground-dwelling insects in summer, augmented with small seeds and berries in winter. They may also swallow grit and sand to help their stomach break up these seeds.

Most of the species live together in flocks. The dunnock is an exception since it prefers to be solitary except when feeding. The dunnock also earned a nickname of &quot;shuffle-wing&quot; since it most strongly displays the characteristic wing flicks used during courtship and other displays.

Accentors may have one to three broods a year. Courtship consists of a great deal of song from the males, which may include short lark-like song flights to attract a mate. In most species, the male and female share in the nest making, with the dunnocks again being an exception; their males have no part in nest building or incubation. They build neat cup nests and lay 3–6 unspotted green or blue eggs. The eggs are incubated for around 12 days. The young are fed by both parents and take an additional 12 days or so to fledge.

==Habitat==
Their typical habitat is mountainous regions in an area far above the tree-line, but below the snow-line. The Alpine accentor has been observed at nearly altitude in the Himalaya and the Altai and Robin accentors at ; however, most accentors breed in scrub vegetation at lower levels. Most species are altitudinal migrants, descending to lower altitudes to spend the winter, but some are long-distance migrants, most notably the Siberian accentor, which migrates 3,000–5,000 km from northern Siberia to China and Korea. Accentors spend the majority of their time in the undergrowth and even when flushed, stay low to the ground until reaching cover.

==Species list==
Twelve species are currently accepted:
* Alpine accentor &quot;Prunella collaris&quot;
* Altai accentor &quot;Prunella himalayana&quot;
* Robin accentor &quot;Prunella rubeculoides&quot;
* Rufous-breasted accentor &quot;Prunella strophiata&quot;
* Siberian accentor &quot;Prunella montanella&quot;
* Brown accentor &quot;Prunella fulvescens&quot;
* Radde&#x27;s accentor &quot;Prunella ocularis&quot; (includes the formerly accepted Arabian accentor &quot;Prunella fagani&quot;, lumped in 2018)
* Black-throated accentor &quot;Prunella atrogularis&quot;
* Kozlov&#x27;s accentor &quot;Prunella koslowi&quot;
* Dunnock &quot;Prunella modularis&quot;
* Japanese accentor &quot;Prunella rubida&quot;
* Maroon-backed accentor &quot;Prunella immaculata&quot;

<text>The French estoc is a type of sword, also called a tuck in English, in use from the 14th to the 17th century. It is characterized by a cruciform hilt with a grip for two-handed use and a straight, edgeless, but sharply pointed blade around in length. It is noted for its ability to pierce mail armor.

==Description==
The estoc was a variation of the longsword designed for fighting against mail armor or plate armor. It was long, straight and stiff with no cutting edge, just a point. Examples from Poland are more than long, with a blade of ; however, others show a more manageable , with a blade. Such swords average about with no specimen weighing more than .

Blade cross-sections can be triangular, square, rhomboid, or flat hexagonal. This geometry leaves hardly any cutting capability as a sharpened edge could simply not be ground but allowed the weapon to be lengthy, stiff, and very acutely pointed.

Early on, the estoc was hung from the saddle when on horseback and simply hung from the belt when a soldier took to the ground. As the weapon developed, however, infantrymen began to wear it in a scabbard. Most varieties of estoc provide a long grip like that of a greatsword, though others mimic the &quot;zweihänder&quot; in providing a long ricasso with a secondary guard of &quot;parierhaken&quot;. 
As on the zweihänder, this extended grip gives the wielder the advantage of extra leverage with which more accurately and powerfully to thrust the long weapon. Some other forms provided finger rings, curved quillons, or other varieties of compound hilts.

==History==

As armour improved, so did the methods of attacking it. It was quickly realized that cutting weapons were losing their effectiveness, so crushing weapons such as maces and axes were utilized. Thrusting weapons that could split the rings of mail, or find the joints and crevices of plate armour, were also employed. Long tapered swords could also be used as lances once an actual lance had splintered. Thus was the estoc developed. The French word &quot;estoc&quot; translates to &quot;thrust&quot;.

While there is nothing to stop an estoc from being one-handed, most are two-handed, being used half-sword or two hands on the grip.

During the English Civil Wars, General George Monck recommended that foot soldiers carry &quot;a good stiff tuck, not very long&quot; because they often broke regular swords by using them to chop firewood.

In addition to being popular for use as a cavalry weapon, the estoc was frequently used during dismounted hand-to-hand combat at tournaments, its lack of a sharp edge reducing the risk of unintentional injury.

===Hunting===
It was also widely employed as a hunting sword in the late 15th century, usually for hunting wild boar, bear, and stag; typically from horseback. Although hunting with a sword is less ideal than using a lance or spear, the added element of danger added to the thrill of the hunt, since using a sword brought the hunter in closer proximity to dangerous animals, as well as bringing more glory. The estoc was useful for this purpose, being a long sword with a strong blade, able to take the shock of meeting with an animal without breaking, while also giving the necessary reach to attack from horseback. However, it also had a very thin, sharp point, designed for penetrating chain mail. This thin point had little immediate terminal wounding effect on a wild boar or bear, unless a vital organ was hit, requiring a second man to stand by with a spear to finish the wounded animal off. It was also very easy to over-penetrate, bringing the wielder into danger from the animal&#x27;s claws and teeth. Around 1500 AD, a solution was reached by replacing the thin point of the estoc with a standard leaf-shaped boar-spear head, in essence creating a one-handed short spear. To prevent the blade from over-penetrating, most were fitted with a cross-shaft above the blade. To allow the blade to fit into a scabbard, these were typically simple removable pegs of wood or bone, but some examples have spring-loaded shafts that automatically deploy when the blade is drawn. An early image of these &quot;boar-spear swords&quot; shows Emperor Maximilian I in a triumphal procession after a successful boar-hunt, the riders proudly carrying their spear-pointed swords upright. These weapons quickly became widely popular all over Europe, and examples can be found in numerous illustrations and descriptions of the time.

==Bullfighting==
&quot;Estoc&quot; is also the name given for the sword used by a matador in the Spanish sport of bullfighting, also known as &quot;espada de matar toros&quot; (&#x27;sword for killing bulls&#x27;). The matador&#x27;s estoc was typically a shorter one-handed thrusting sword that was around in length.

<text>The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, commonly known by its French name Union internationale des associations d&#x27;alpinisme (UIAA; ), was founded in August 1932 in Chamonix, France when 20 mountaineering associations met for an alpine congress. Count Charles Egmond d&#x27;Arcis, from Switzerland, was chosen as the first president and it was decided by the founding members that the UIAA would be an international federation which would be in charge of the &quot;study and solution of all problems regarding mountaineering&quot;. The UIAA Safety Label was created in 1960 and was internationally approved in 1965 and currently (2015) has a global presence on five continents with 86 member associations in 62 countries representing over 3 million people.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and in accordance with the IOC recommendations, the UIAA suspended all UIAA officials from Russia, and delegates from the Russian Mountaineering Federation (RMF) and Russian officials and athletes were excluded from all UIAA-sanctioned activities and events.

<text>A worldview (also world-view) or  is said to be the fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual or society encompassing the whole of the individual&#x27;s or society&#x27;s knowledge, culture, and point of view. However, when two parties view the same real world phenomenon, their world views may differ, one including elements that the other does not.

A worldview can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;worldview&quot; is a calque of the German word , composed of (&#x27;world&#x27;) and (&#x27;perception&#x27; or &#x27;view&#x27;). The German word is also used in English. It is a concept fundamental to German philosophy, especially epistemology and refers to a &quot;wide world perception&quot;. Additionally, it refers to the framework of ideas and beliefs forming a global description through which an individual, group or culture watches and interprets the world and interacts with it as a social reality.

== and cognitive philosophy==

Within cognitive philosophy and the cognitive sciences is the German concept of &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;. This expression is used to refer to the &quot;wide worldview&quot; or &quot;wide world perception&quot; of a people, family, or person. The of a people originates from the unique world experience of a people, which they experience over several millennia. The language of a people reflects the of that people in the form of its syntactic structures and untranslatable connotations and its denotations.

The term &quot;&quot; is often wrongly attributed to Wilhelm von Humboldt, the founder of German ethnolinguistics. However, Humboldt&#x27;s key concept was &quot;Weltansicht&quot;. &quot;Weltansicht&quot; was used by Humboldt to refer to the overarching conceptual and sensorial apprehension of reality shared by a linguistic community (Nation). On the other hand, , first used by Immanuel Kant and later popularized by Hegel, was always used in German and later in English to refer more to philosophies, ideologies and cultural or religious perspectives, than to linguistic communities and their mode of apprehending reality.

In 1911, the German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey published an essay entitled &quot;The Types of and their Development in Metaphysics&quot; that became quite influential. Dilthey characterized worldviews as providing a perspective on life that encompasses the cognitive, evaluative, and volitional aspects of human experience. Although worldviews have always been expressed in literature and religion, philosophers have attempted to give them conceptual definition in their metaphysical systems. On that basis, Dilthey found it possible to distinguish three general recurring types of worldview. The first of these he called naturalism because it gives priority to the perceptual and experimental determination of what is and allows contingency to influence how we evaluate and respond to reality. Naturalism can be found in Democritus, Hobbes, Hume and many other modern philosophers. The second type of worldview is called the idealism of freedom and is represented by Plato, Descartes, Kant, and Bergson among others. It is dualistic and gives primacy to the freedom of the will. The organizational order of our world is structured by our mind and the will to know. The third type is called objective idealism and Dilthey sees it in Heraclitus, Parmenides, Spinoza, Leibniz and Hegel. In objective idealism the ideal does not hover above what is actual but inheres in it. This third type of worldview is ultimately monistic and seeks to discern the inner coherence and harmony among all things. Dilthey thought it impossible to come up with a universally valid metaphysical or systematic formulation of any of these worldviews, but regarded them as useful schema for his own more reflective kind of life philosophy. See Makkreel and Rodi, Wilhelm Dilthey, Selected Works, volume 6, 2019.

Anthropologically, worldviews can be expressed as the &quot;fundamental cognitive, affective, and evaluative presuppositions a group of people make about the nature of things, and which they use to order their lives.&quot;

If it were possible to draw a map of the world on the basis of , it would probably be seen to cross political borders— is the product of political borders and common experiences of a people from a geographical region, environmental-climatic conditions, the economic resources available, socio-cultural systems, and the language family. (The work of the population geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza aims to show the gene-linguistic co-evolution of people).

According to James W. Underhill, worldview can periodically be used very differently by certain linguists and sociologists. It is for this reason that Underhill, and those who influenced him, attempted to wed metaphor in, for example, the sociology of religion, with discourse analysis. Underhill also proposed five subcategories for the study of worldview: world-perceiving, world-conceiving, cultural mindset, personal world, and perspective.

==Comparison of worldviews==

One can think of a worldview as comprising a number of basic beliefs which are philosophically equivalent to the axioms of the worldview considered as a logical or consistent theory. These basic beliefs cannot, by definition, be proven (in the logical sense) within the worldview – precisely because they are axioms, and are typically argued &quot;from&quot; rather than argued &quot;for&quot;. However their coherence can be explored philosophically and logically.

If two different worldviews have sufficient common beliefs it may be possible to have a constructive dialogue between them.

On the other hand, if different worldviews are held to be basically incommensurate and irreconcilable, then the situation is one of cultural relativism and would therefore incur the standard criticisms from philosophical realists.
Additionally, religious believers might not wish to see their beliefs relativized into something that is only &quot;true for them&quot;.
Subjective logic is a belief-reasoning formalism where beliefs explicitly are subjectively held by individuals but where a consensus between different worldviews can be achieved.

A third alternative sees the worldview approach as only a methodological relativism, as a suspension of judgment about the truth of various belief systems but not a declaration that there is no global truth. For instance, the religious philosopher Ninian Smart begins his &quot;Worldviews: Cross-cultural Explorations of Human Beliefs&quot; with &quot;Exploring Religions and Analysing Worldviews&quot; and argues for &quot;the neutral, dispassionate study of different religious and secular systems—a process I call worldview analysis.&quot;

The comparison of religious, philosophical or scientific worldviews is a delicate endeavor, because such worldviews start from different presuppositions and cognitive values. Clément Vidal has proposed metaphilosophical criteria for the comparison of worldviews, classifying them in three broad categories:

# &quot;objective&quot;: objective consistency, scientificity, scope
# &quot;subjective&quot;: subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality
# &quot;intersubjective&quot;: intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity

=== Characteristics ===

While Leo Apostel and his followers clearly hold that individuals can construct worldviews, other writers regard worldviews as operating at a community level, or in an unconscious way. For instance, if one&#x27;s worldview is fixed by one&#x27;s language, as according to a strong version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, one would have to learn or invent a new language in order to construct a new worldview.

According to Apostel, a worldview is an ontology, or a descriptive model of the world. It should comprise these six elements:

# An explanation of the world
# A futurology, answering the question &quot;Where are we heading?&quot;
# Values, answers to ethical questions: &quot;What should we do?&quot;
# A praxeology, or methodology, or theory of action: &quot;How should we attain our goals?&quot;
# An epistemology, or theory of knowledge: &quot;What is true and false?&quot;
# An etiology. A constructed world-view should contain an account of its own &quot;building blocks&quot;, its origins and construction.

==Terror management theory==


A worldview, according to terror management theory (TMT), serves as a buffer against death anxiety. It is theorized that living up to the ideals of one&#x27;s worldview provides a sense of self-esteem which provides a sense of transcending the limits of human life (e.g. literally, as in religious belief in immortality; symbolically, as in art works or children to live on after one&#x27;s death, or in contributions to one&#x27;s culture). Evidence in support of terror management theory includes a series of experiments by Jeff Schimel and colleagues in which a group of Canadians found to score highly on a measure of patriotism were asked to read an essay attacking the dominant Canadian worldview.

Using a test of death-thought accessibility (DTA), involving an ambiguous word completion test (e.g. &quot;COFF__&quot; could either be completed as either &quot;COFFEE&quot; or &quot;COFFIN&quot; or &quot;COFFER&quot;), participants who had read the essay attacking their worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of DTA than the control group, who read a similar essay attacking Australian cultural values. Mood was also measured following the worldview threat, to test whether the increase in death thoughts following worldview threat were due to other causes, for example, anger at the attack on one&#x27;s cultural worldview. No significant changes on mood scales were found immediately following the worldview threat.

To test the generalisability of these findings to groups and worldviews other than those of nationalistic Canadians, Schimel &quot;et al&quot; conducted a similar experiment on a group of religious individuals whose worldview included that of creationism. Participants were asked to read an essay which argued in support of the theory of evolution, following which the same measure of DTA was taken as for the Canadian group. Religious participants with a creationist worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of death-thought accessibility than those of the control group.

Goldenberg &quot;et al&quot; found that highlighting the similarities between humans and other animals increases death-thought accessibility, as does attention to the physical rather than meaningful qualities of sex.

==Religion==

Nishida Kitaro wrote extensively on &quot;the Religious Worldview&quot; in exploring the philosophical significance of Eastern religions.

According to Neo-Calvinist David Naugle&#x27;s &quot;World view: The History of a Concept&quot;, &quot;Conceiving of Christianity as a worldview has been one of the most significant developments in the recent history of the church.&quot;

The Christian thinker James W. Sire defines a worldview as &quot;a commitment, a fundamental orientation of the heart, that can be expressed as a story or in a set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be true, partially true, or entirely false) which we hold (consciously or subconsciously, consistently or inconsistently) about the basic construction of reality, and that provides the foundation on which we live and move and have our being.&quot; He suggests that &quot;we should all think in terms of worldviews, that is, with a consciousness not only of our own way of thought but also that of other people, so that we can first understand and then genuinely communicate with others in our pluralistic society.&quot;

The commitment mentioned by James W. Sire can be extended further. The worldview increases the commitment to serve the world. With the change of a person&#x27;s view towards the world, he/she can be motivated to serve the world. This serving attitude has been illustrated by Tareq M Zayed as the &#x27;Emancipatory Worldview&#x27; in his writing &quot;History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners&quot;.

David Bell has also raised questions on religious worldviews for the designers of superintelligences – machines much smarter than humans.

<text>Christian Harald Lauritz Peter Emil Bohr (1855–1911) was a Danish physician, father of the physicist and Nobel laureate Niels Bohr, as well as the mathematician and football player Harald Bohr and grandfather of another physicist and Nobel laureate Aage Bohr. He married Ellen Adler in 1881.

==Personal life==
He wrote his first scientific paper, &quot;Om salicylsyrens indflydelse på kødfordøjelsen&quot; (&quot;On salicylic acid&#x27;s influence on the digestion of meat&quot;), at the age of 22. He received his medical degree in 1880, studied under Carl Ludwig at University of Leipzig, took a Ph.D. in physiology and was appointed professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen in 1886.

On his religious views, Bohr was raised as a Lutheran Christian. He was an atheist in later life.

Christian Bohr is buried in the Assistens Kirkegård.

==Physiology==
In 1891, he was the first to characterize dead space.

In 1904, Christian Bohr described the phenomenon, now called the Bohr effect, whereby hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide heterotopically decrease hemoglobin&#x27;s oxygen-binding affinity. This regulation increases the efficiency of oxygen release by hemoglobin in tissues, like active muscle tissue, where rapid metabolization has produced relatively high concentrations of hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide.

<doc id="213454" wikidata="Q10517" url="?curid=213454" title="Corvus (constellation)">
<text>Corvus is a small constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its name means &quot;crow&quot; in Latin. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it depicts a raven, a bird associated with stories about the god Apollo, perched on the back of Hydra the water snake. The four brightest stars, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Beta Corvi, form a distinctive quadrilateral or cross-shape in the night sky.

With an apparent magnitude of 2.59, Gamma Corvi—also known as Gienah—is the brightest star in the constellation. It is an aging blue giant around four times as massive as the Sun. The young star Eta Corvi has been found to have two debris disks. Three star systems have exoplanets, and a fourth planetary system is unconfirmed. TV Corvi is a dwarf nova—a white dwarf and brown dwarf in very close orbit.

==History and mythology==
In the Babylonian star catalogues dating from at least 1100 BCE, what later became known as Corvus was called the Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). As with more familiar Classical astronomy, it was placed sitting on the tail of the Serpent (Greek Hydra). The Babylonian constellation was sacred to Adad, the god of rain and storm; in the second Millennium BCE it would have risen just before the autumnal rainy season. John H. Rogers observed that Hydra signified Ningishzida, the god of the underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle Aquila and the fish Piscis Austrinus, were introduced to the Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the winter and summer solstices respectively. Furthermore, Hydra had been a landmark as it had straddled the celestial equator in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.
Corvus is associated with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow (or raven in some versions), he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.

===In other cultures===
In Chinese astronomy, the stars of Corvus are located within the Vermilion Bird of the South (南方朱雀, &quot;Nán Fāng Zhū Què&quot;). The four main stars depict a chariot, &quot;Zhen&quot;, which is the 28th and final lunar mansion; Alpha and Eta mark the linchpins for the wheels, and Zeta is &quot;Changsha&quot;, a coffin. In Indian astronomy, the five main stars of Corvus represent a hand or fist corresponding to the &quot;Hasta&quot;, the 13th &quot;nakshatra&quot; or lunar mansion.

Corvus was recognized as a constellation by several Polynesian cultures and used as a guide for ocean navigation. 
In the Marquesas Islands, it was called &quot;Mee&quot;; in Pukapuka, it was called &quot;Te Manu&quot;, and in the Society Islands, it was called &quot;Metua-ai-papa&quot;. To Torres Strait Islanders, Corvus was the right hand (holding &quot;kupa&quot; fruit) of the huge constellation Tagai, a man fishing.

The Bororo people of Mato Grosso in central Brazil regarded the constellation as a land tortoise &quot;Geriguigui&quot;, while the Tucano people of the northwestern Amazon region saw it as an egret. To the Tupi people of São Luís Island in Brazil, Corvus might have been seen as a grill or barbecue—&quot;seychouioura&quot;, on which fish were grilled. The depiction could have also referred to the Great Square of Pegasus.

== Characteristics ==
Covering 184 square degrees and hence 0.446% of the sky, Corvus ranks 70th of the 88 constellations in area. It is bordered by Virgo to the north and east, Hydra to the south, and Crater to the west. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Crv&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of six segments (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −11.68° and −25.20°. Its position in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of 65°N.

==Features==
===Stars===

The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters Alpha through Eta to label the most prominent stars in the constellation. John Flamsteed gave nine stars Flamsteed designations, while one star he designated in the neighbouring constellation Crater—31 Crateris—lay within Corvus once the constellation boundaries were established in 1930. Within the constellation&#x27;s borders, there are 29 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5.

Four principal stars, Delta, Gamma, Epsilon, and Beta Corvi, form a quadrilateral asterism known as &quot;the &quot;Spica&#x27;s Spanker&quot; or &quot;the Sail&quot;. Although none of the stars are particularly bright, they lie in a dim area of the sky, rendering the asterism easy to distinguish in the night sky. Gamma and Delta serve as pointers toward Spica.

Also called Gienah, Gamma is the brightest star in Corvus at magnitude 2.59. Its traditional name means &quot;wing&quot;, the star marking the left wing in Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot;. 154±1 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white hued giant star of spectral type B8III that is times as massive, and 355 times as luminous as the Sun. Around million years old, it has largely exhausted its core hydrogen and begun expanding and cooling as it moves away from the main sequence. A binary star, it has a companion orange or red dwarf star of spectral type K5V to M5V that is about 0.8 times as massive as the Sun. Around 50 astronomical units distant from Gamma Corvi A, it is estimated to complete an orbit in 158 years. 

Delta Corvi, traditionally called Algorab, is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.9, around 87 light-years from Earth. An enigmatic star around 2.7 times as massive as the Sun, it is more luminous (65–70 times that of the Sun) than its should be for its surface temperature of 10,400 K, and hence is either a 3.2 million year-old very young pre-main sequence star that has not settled down to a stable main sequence life stage, or a 260-million-year-old star that has begun to exhaust its core hydrogen and expand, cool and shine more brightly as it moves away from the main sequence. Its spectral type is given as A0IV, corresponding with the latter scenario. Warm circumstellar dust—by definition part of its inner stellar system—has been detected around Delta Corvi A. Delta Corvi B is an orange dwarf star of magnitude 8.51 and spectral class K, also surrounded by circumstellar dust. A post T-tauri star, it is at least 650 AU distant from its brighter companion and takes at least 9400 years to complete an orbit. Delta Corvi&#x27;s common name means &quot;the raven&quot;. It is one of two stars marking the right wing. Located 4.5 degrees northeast of Delta Corvi is Struve 1669, a binary star that is divisible into two stars 5.4&quot; apart by small amateur telescopes, 280 light-years from Earth. The pair, both white stars, are visible to the naked eye at magnitude 5.2; the primary is of magnitude 5.9 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0.

The raven&#x27;s breast is marked by Beta Corvi (the proper name is Kraz), a star of magnitude 2.7 located 146 ± 1 light-years from Earth. Roughly 206 million years old and 3.7 ± 1 times as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted its core hydrogen and expanded and cooled to a surface temperature of around 5,100 K and is now a yellow bright giant star of spectral type G5II. It likely spent most of its existence as a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B7V. Bearing the proper name of Minkar and marking the raven&#x27;s nostril is Epsilon Corvi, located some 318 ± 5 light-years from Earth. It is a red giant of spectral type K2III that is around 54 times the Sun&#x27;s radius and 930 times its luminosity. Around 4 times as massive as the Sun, it spent much of its life as a main-sequence star of spectral type B5V. Lying to the south of the quadrilateral between Beta and Epsilon Corvi is the orange-hued 6 Corvi, an ageing giant star of spectral type K1III that is around 70 times as luminous as the Sun. It is 331 ± 10 light-years away from Earth.

Named Alchiba, Alpha Corvi is a white-hued star of spectral type F1V and magnitude 4.0, 48.7 ± 0.1 light-years from Earth. It exhibits periodic changes in its spectrum over a three-day period, which suggests it is either a spectroscopic binary or (more likely) a pulsating Gamma Doradus-type variable. If the latter is the case, it is estimated to be 1.39 times as massive as the Sun. According to Bayer&#x27;s atlas, it lies above the bird&#x27;s beak.

Marking the raven&#x27;s right wing is Eta Corvi, a yellow-white main-sequence star of type F2V that is 1.52 times as massive and 4.87 times as luminous as the Sun. It is 59 light-years distant from our Solar System. Two debris disks have been detected orbiting this star, one warm within 3.5 astronomical units and another out at ~150 astronomical units distant. Zeta Corvi marks the raven&#x27;s neck. It is of apparent magnitude 5.21, separated by 7 arcseconds from the star HR 4691. Located 420 ± 10 light-years distant, it is a blue-white Be star of spectral type B8V, the presence of hydrogen emission lines in its spectrum indicating it has a circumstellar disc. These stars may be an optical double or a true multiple star system, with a separation of at least 50,000 astronomical units and the stars taking 3.5 million years to orbit each other. HR 4691 is itself double, composed of an ageing yellow-orange giant whose spectral type has been calculated at K0 or G3, and an F-type main-sequence star.
31 Crateris (which was originally placed in Crater by Flamsteed) is a 5.26 magnitude star which was once mistaken for a moon of Mercury. On 27 March 1974, the &quot;Mariner 10&quot; mission detected emissions in the far ultraviolet from the planet (suggesting a satellite), but they were found to emanate from the star. It is in reality a remote binary star system with a hot blue-white star of spectral type B1.5V and a companion about which little is known. The two stars orbit each other every 2.9631 days. The primary is possibly a blue straggler of the Hyades group. The primary is around 15.5 times as massive as the Sun and 52262 times as luminous.

VV Corvi is a close spectroscopic binary, its two component stars orbiting each other with a period of 1.46 days. Both are yellow-white main-sequence stars of spectral type F5V, though the primary has begun expanding and cooling as it nears the end of its time on the main sequence. The mass ratio of the two stars is 0.775 ± 0.024. A tertiary companion was discovered during the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. W Corvi is an eclipsing binary that varies in brightness from apparent magnitude 11.16 to 12.5 over 9 hours. Its period has increased by 1/4 second over a century. It is an unusual system in that its two stars are very close to each other yet have different surface temperatures, and hence thermal transfer is not taking place as expected. SX Corvi is an eclipsing binary that is also a contact binary known as a W Ursae Majoris variable. The two component stars orbit closely enough to each other for mass to have been transferred between them—in this case the secondary having transferred a large amount of mass to the primary. RV Corvi is another eclipsing binary. Its brightness varies from apparent magnitude 8.6 to 9.16 over 18 hours. The system is composed of stars of spectral types F0 and G0, which orbit each other every 0.7473 days.

Close to Gamma Corvi and visible in the same binocular field is R Corvi, a long period (Mira) variable star. It ranges in brightness from a magnitude of 6.7 to 14.4 with a period of approximately 317 days. TT Corvi is a semiregular variable red giant of spectral type M3III and apparent magnitude 6.48 around 923 light years distant. It is around 993 times as luminous as the Sun. TU Corvi is a Delta Scuti variable—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. It varies by 0.025 of a magnitude around apparent magnitude 6.53 over 59 minutes.

Three star systems have confirmed planets. HD 103774 is a young yellow-white main-sequence star of apparent magnitude 7.12 that is 181 ± 5 light-years distant from Earth. It is 1.335 ± 0.03 times as massive and 3.5 ± 0.3 as luminous as the Sun. Variations in its radial velocity showed it was being orbited by a Neptune-sized planet every 5.9 days in 2013. HD 104067 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K2V of apparent magnitude 7.93 that is 69 ± 1 light-years distant from Earth. Around 80% as massive as the Sun, it is orbited by a planet 3.6 times the mass of Neptune every 55.8 days. WASP-83 has a planet around as massive as Saturn that orbits it every 5 days. It was discovered by its transit across the star in 2015. A fourth star system has an unconfirmed planet. HD 111031 is a sunlike star of spectral type G5V located 101 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth.

Ross 695 is a red dwarf star located a mere 28.9 ± 0.6 light-years distant from Earth. At apparent magnitude 11.27, it is much too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. A small star, it has around 23% the mass and radius of the Sun, but only 0.7% its luminosity. VHS J1256–1257 is a triple system of young brown dwarfs located light-years distant from Earth. The system consists of a central, equal-mass binary system of late-M spectral type dwarfs and an outer, planetary-mass brown dwarf companion that is widely separated at 102 ± 9 AU. DENIS-P J1228.2-1547 is a system composed of two brown dwarfs orbiting each other located 73 ± 3 light-years away from Earth. TV Corvi is a dwarf nova composed of a white dwarf and brown dwarf that orbit each other every 90 minutes. The system has a baseline magnitude of 17 that brightens periodically to magnitude 12, discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1931 and David Levy in 1990 and 2005.

===Deep-sky objects===

Corvus contains no Messier objects. It has several galaxies and a planetary nebula observable with amateur telescopes. The center of Corvus is home to a planetary nebula, NGC 4361. The nebula itself resembles a small elliptical galaxy and has a magnitude of 10.3, but the magnitude 13 star at its centre gives away its true nature. Corvus also contains the Stargate (asterism).

The NGC 4038 Group is a group of galaxies across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the Antennae peculiar galaxy, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two interacting galaxies—NGC 4038 and 4039—that appear to have a heart shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies&#x27; original rotation. Both original galaxies were spiral galaxies and are now experiencing extensive star formation due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting binary stars or intermediate-mass black holes. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. SN 2004gt was a type Ic supernova that erupted on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC Wolf–Rayet star with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system. SN 2007sr was a Type Ia supernova event that peaked in brightness on December 14, 2007. The galaxy has been identified as a good place to take detailed images in case of further supernovae.

NGC 4027 is another member of the NGC 4038 group, notable for its extended spiral arm. Known as the Ringtail Galaxy, it lies close to 31 Crateris. A barred spiral galaxy, its distorted shape is probably due to a past collision, possibly with the nearby NGC 4027A. NGC 4782 and NGC 4783 are a pair of merging elliptical galaxies in the northeastern part of the constellation, around 200 million light-years distant.

Two established meteor showers originate from within Corvus&#x27; boundaries. German astronomer Cuno Hoffmeister discovered and named the Corvids in 1937, after observing them between June 25 and July 2. They have not been seen since, nor was there evidence of a shower when previous records were examined. Hoffmeister noted the trajectory of the shower was similar to that of the comet 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, though this was not confirmed by Zhukov and colleagues in 2011. The shower has been tentatively linked with 4015 Wilson–Harrington. In January 2013, the MO Video Meteor Network published the discovery of the Eta Corvids, assigning some 300 meteors seen between January 20 and 26. Their existence was confirmed by data analysis later that year.

==Popular culture==
In 1624, German astronomer Jakob Bartsch equated the constellation Argo Navis with Noah&#x27;s Ark, linking Corvus and Columba to the crow and dove that feature in the story in Genesis.

In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #14 (January 2013), which was published 7 November 2012, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson appears in the story, in which he determines that Superman&#x27;s home planet, Krypton, orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus, 27.1 light-years from Earth. Tyson assisted DC Comics in selecting a real-life star that would be an appropriate parent star to Krypton, and picked the star in Corvus, the mascot of Superman&#x27;s high school, the Smallville Crows.

<doc id="213455" wikidata="Q447541" url="?curid=213455" title="Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester">
<text>Humphrey of Lancaster, Duke of Gloucester (3 October 1390 – 23 February 1447) was an English prince, soldier and literary patron. He was (as he styled himself) &quot;son, brother and uncle of kings&quot;, being the fourth and youngest son of Henry IV of England, the brother of Henry V, and the uncle of Henry VI. Gloucester fought in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and acted as Lord Protector of England during the minority of his nephew. A controversial figure, he has been characterised as reckless, unprincipled, and fractious, but is also noted for his intellectual activity and for being the first significant English patron of humanism, in the context of the Renaissance.

Unlike his brothers, Humphrey was given no major military command by his father, instead receiving an intellectual upbringing. Created Duke of Gloucester in 1414, he participated in Henry V&#x27;s campaigns during the Hundred Years&#x27; War in France: he fought at Agincourt in 1415 and at the conquest of Normandy in 1417–9. Following the king&#x27;s death in 1422, Gloucester became one of the leading figures in the regency government of the infant Henry VI. He proved a rash, impulsive, unscrupulous and troublesome figure, he quarrelled constantly with his brother, John, Duke of Bedford and uncle, Cardinal Henry Beaufort and went so far as to violently prosecute a dispute with the Duke of Burgundy, a key English ally in France, over conflicting claims to lands in the Low Countries.

Humphrey was the exemplar of the romantic chivalric persona. Mettled and courageous, he was a foil for the countess Jacqueline of Hainaut, his first wife. His learned, widely read, scholarly approach to the early renaissance cultural expansion demonstrated the quintessential well-rounded princely character. He was a paragon for Eton College and an exemplar for the University of Oxford, accomplished, diplomatic, with political cunning. Despite the errors in his public and private life and the mischief he caused in politics, Gloucester is also at times praised as a patron of learning and a benefactor to the University of Oxford. He was popular among the literary figures of his age for his scholarly activity and with the common people for his advocacy of a spirited foreign policy. For these causes, he was known as the &quot;good Duke Humphrey&quot;.

Gloucester never fully achieved his desired dominance in England, and his attempts to gain a foreign principality for himself were fruitless. A staunch opponent of concessions in the French conflict and a proponent of offensive warfare, Gloucester gradually lost favour among the political community, and King Henry VI after the end of his minority, following defeats in France. The trial in 1441 of Eleanor Cobham, his second wife, under charges of witchcraft, destroyed Gloucester&#x27;s political influence. In 1447, he was accused, probably falsely, of treason and died a few days later while under arrest.

==Childhood and early career==
The place of Humphrey&#x27;s birth is unknown, but he was named after his maternal grandfather, Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford. He was the youngest in a powerful quadrumvirate of brothers, who were very close companions; on 20 March 1413, Henry and Humphrey had been at their dying father&#x27;s bedside. Thomas, John and Humphrey had all been knighted in 1399. They joined the Order of the Garter together in 1400.

During the reign of Henry IV, Humphrey received a scholar&#x27;s education, possibly at Balliol College, Oxford, while his elder brothers fought on the Welsh and Scottish borders. Following his father&#x27;s death he was created Duke of Gloucester in 1414, and Chamberlain of England, and he took his seat in Parliament. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1415.

==Diplomatic and military career==
He joined Henry V&#x27;s campaigns in France. Before embarking, the army camped at Southampton, where the Earl of Cambridge failed in the Southampton Plot an assassination plot against the king. Humphrey and his brother, the Duke of Clarence, led an Inquiry of Lords to try Cambridge and Scrope for high treason on 5 August.

During the campaign, Humphrey gained a reputation as a commander. His knowledge of siege warfare, gained from his classical studies, contributed to the fall of Honfleur. During the Battle of Agincourt Humphrey was wounded; as he fell, the king sheltered him and withstood a determined assault from French knights. For his services, Humphrey was granted offices including Constable of Dover, Warden of the Cinque Ports on 27 November and King&#x27;s Lieutenant. His tenure in government was peaceful and successful. This period commenced with Emperor Sigismund&#x27;s peace mission, the only visit of a medieval emperor to England. According to &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;, Humphrey was the principal actor in a symbolic ceremony. He welcomed the emperor on the shoreline with a sword in his hand, &quot;extorting&quot; from Sigismund the renunciation of his prerogatives of dominion over the king of England before allowing him to land on the evening of 1 May 1416. The Treaty of &quot;eternal friendship&quot; signed at Canterbury on 15 August served only to anticipate renewed hostility from France.

Upon the death of his brother in 1422, Humphrey became Lord Protector to his young nephew Henry VI, then a baby. He also claimed the right to the regency of England following the death of his elder brother, John, Duke of Bedford, in 1435. Humphrey&#x27;s claims were strongly contested by the lords of the king&#x27;s council and in particular his half-uncle, Cardinal Henry Beaufort. Henry V&#x27;s will, rediscovered at Eton College in 1978, actually supported Humphrey&#x27;s claims. In 1436 Philip, Duke of Burgundy, attacked Calais. Duke Humphrey was appointed garrison commander. The Flemings assaulted from the landward but the English resistance was stubborn. Humphrey marched the army to Baillieul, taking the English to safety; he threatened St. Omer before sailing home.

Humphrey was consistently popular with the citizens of London and the Commons. He also had a widespread reputation as a patron of learning and the arts. His popularity with the people and his ability to keep the peace earned him the appointment of Chief Justice of South Wales. His unpopular marriage to Eleanor Cobham became ammunition for his enemies. Eleanor was arrested and tried for sorcery and heresy in 1441 and Humphrey retired from public life. He was arrested on a charge of treason on 20 February 1447 and died at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk three days later. He was buried at St Albans Abbey, adjacent to St Alban&#x27;s shrine. Some suspected that he had been poisoned, though it is more probable that he died of a stroke.

In each subsequent year, a petition was made to Parliament to rehabilitate &#x27;Good Duke Humphrey&#x27;, and by the end of the century his reputation had been restored.

==Marriages==


He married twice but left no surviving legitimate progeny.

===First marriage: Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut and Holland===
In about 1423 he married Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut and Holland (died 1436), daughter of William VI, Count of Hainaut. Through this marriage Gloucester assumed the title &quot;Count of Holland, Zeeland and Hainault&quot;, and briefly fought to retain these titles when they were contested by Jacqueline&#x27;s cousin Philip the Good (see: War of Succession in Holland). They had a stillborn child in 1424. The marriage was annulled in 1428, and Jacqueline died (disinherited) in 1436.

===Second marriage: Eleanor Cobham===
In 1428 Humphrey married, secondly, Eleanor Cobham, his mistress, who in 1441 was tried and convicted of practising witchcraft against the king in an attempt to retain power for her husband. She was condemned to public penance followed by exile and life imprisonment. The marriage was without progeny.

===Children===
By mistresses unknown Humphrey had two illegitimate children. Eleanor Cobham was possibly the mother of one or both, before their marriage. Due to their illegitimacy, they were unable to succeed to their father&#x27;s titles. The illegitimate children were:
* Arthur Plantagenet (died after 1447)
* Antigone Plantagenet, who married firstly Henry Grey, 2nd Earl of Tankerville, Lord of Powys (–1450) and secondly John d&#x27;Amancier.

==Legacy==

After inheriting the manor of Greenwich, Gloucester enclosed Greenwich Park and from 1428 had a palace built there on the banks of the Thames, known as &quot;Bella Court&quot; and later as the Palace of Placentia or La Pleasaunce. The Duke Humphrey Tower surmounting Greenwich Park was demolished in the 1660s and the site was chosen for building the Royal Observatory. His name lives on in Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library, part of the Bodleian Library in Oxford University, and in Duke Humphrey Road on Blackheath, south of Greenwich. Duke Humphrey was a patron and protector of Oxford, donating more than 280 manuscripts to the university. The possession of such a library did much to stimulate new learning.

Duke Humphrey was also a patron of literature, notably of the poet John Lydgate and of John Capgrave. He corresponded with many leading Italian humanists and commissioned translations of Greek classics into Latin. His friendship with Zano Castiglione, Bishop of Bayeux, led to many further connections on the Continent, including Leonardo Bruni, Pietro Candido Decembrio and Tito Livio Frulovisi. Duke Humphrey also patronised the Abbey of St Albans.

Together with his second wife, Eleanor, he commissioned a hanap, a drinking goblet, possibly as their wedding cup. This hanap, known as the Wreathen Cup, was used when they hosted dinners at La Pleasance and their London residence, Baynard&#x27;s Castle. It found its way into the possession of his kinswoman, Lady Margaret Beaufort, who bequeathed it to her confessor, Dr Edmund Wilford, of Oriel College, Oxford. He exchanged it for another piece of silver left by Lady Margaret to her foundation at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where it remains. How it reached Lady Margaret is unclear, but a fellow of the college has conjectured that it came through her husband, Thomas Stanley, who had custody of Eleanor during her imprisonment and was involved in liquidating Humphrey&#x27;s estate.

Duke Humphrey&#x27;s Walk was the name of an aisle in Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral near to what was popularly believed to be Duke Humphrey&#x27;s tomb, though, according to W. Carew Hazlitt, it was, in reality, a monument to John Lord Beauchamp de Warwick (died 1360). This was an area frequented by thieves and beggars. The phrase &quot;to dine with Duke Humphrey&quot; was used of poor people who had no money for a meal, in reference to this. Saki updates the phrase by referring to a &quot;Duke Humphrey picnic&quot;, one without food, in his short story &quot;The Feast of Nemesis&quot;. In fact, Humphrey&#x27;s tomb is in the Abbey of St Albans (the cathedral): it was restored by Hertfordshire Freemasons in 2000 to celebrate the millennium.
===In literature===

In Shakespeare&#x27;s History plays, the portrayal of Humphrey is notable for being one of the most unambiguously sympathetic: in the War of the Roses Tetralogy, he is one of only a handful of historical personages to be portrayed in a uniformly positive light. He appears as a minor character in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;, but as a major character in two others: his conflict with Cardinal Beaufort is portrayed in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, and his disgrace and death following his wife&#x27;s alleged sorcery is depicted in &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;. Shakespeare portrays Humphrey&#x27;s death as a murder, ordered by William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Queen Margaret of Anjou.

The 1723 play &quot;Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester&quot; by Ambrose Philips revolves around the life of Gloucester. In the original Drury Lane production he was played by Barton Booth.

Margaret Frazer&#x27;s 2003 historical mystery, &quot;The Bastard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, revolves around the events surrounding Gloucester&#x27;s arrest and death.

A short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), it was in active service with the United States Army in West Germany from June 1958 to June 1964 as part of NATO&#x27;s Cold War defense of Western Europe. It was the first US missile to carry a live nuclear warhead, in the 1958 Pacific Ocean weapons test Hardtack Teak.

The Redstone was a direct descendant of the German V-2 rocket, developed primarily by a team of German rocket engineers brought to the United States after World War II. The design used an upgraded engine from Rocketdyne that allowed the missile to carry the W39 and its reentry vehicle to a range of about . Redstone&#x27;s prime contractor was the Chrysler Corporation.

The Redstone spawned the Redstone rocket family which holds a number of firsts in the US space program, notably launching the first US astronaut. It was retired by the Army in 1964 and replaced by the solid-fueled MGM-31 Pershing. Surplus missiles were widely used for test missions and space launches, including the first US man in space, and in 1967 the launch of Australia&#x27;s first satellite.

==History==

Redstone was a direct descendant of the German V-2 rocket, developed by a team of predominantly German rocket engineers under the leadership of Wernher von Braun, that had been brought to the United States after World War II as part of Operation Paperclip.

A product of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, Redstone was designed as a surface-to-surface missile for the U.S. Army. It was named for the arsenal on 8 April 1952, which traced its name to the region&#x27;s red rocks and soil. The first Redstone lifted off from LC-4A at Cape Canaveral on 20 August 1953. It flew for one minute and 20 seconds before suffering an engine failure and falling into the sea. Following this partial success, the second test was conducted on 27 January 1954, this time without a hitch as the missile flew . After these first two prototypes were flown, an improved engine was introduced to reduce problems with LOX turbopump cavitation.

The third Redstone flight on 5 May was a total loss as the engine cut off one second after launch, causing the rocket to fall back on the pad and explode. After this incident, Major General Holger Toftoy pressured Wernher von Braun for the cause of the failure. The latter replied that he had no idea, but they would review telemetry and other data to find out. Toftoy persisted, asking &quot;Wernher, why did the rocket explode?&quot; An exasperated von Braun said &quot;It exploded because the damn sonofabitch blew up!&quot;

Von Braun pressured the ABMA team to improve reliability and workmanship standards, allegedly remarking that &quot;Missile reliability will require that the target area is more dangerous than the launch area.&quot; Subsequent test flights went better and the Army declared Redstone operational in mid-1955. Testing was moved from LC-4 to the bigger LC-5 and LC-6.

The Redstone program proved to be a bone of contention between the Army and Air Force due to their different ideas of nuclear warfare. The Army favored using small warheads on mobile missiles as tactical battlefield weapons while the Air Force, which was responsible for the ICBM program, wanted large trans-continental missiles that could strike Soviet targets and rapidly cripple the USSR&#x27;s infrastructure and ability to wage war.

With the arrival of newer solid-fueled missiles that could be stored and not require fueling before launch, Redstone was rendered obsolete and production ended in 1961. The 40th Artillery Group was deactivated in February 1964 and 46th Artillery Group was deactivated in June 1964, as Redstone missiles were replaced by the Pershing missile in the U.S. Army arsenal. All Redstone missiles and equipment deployed to Europe were returned to the United States by the third quarter of 1964. In October 1964, the Redstone missile was ceremonially retired from active service at Redstone Arsenal.

==Description==
Redstone was capable of flights from . It consisted of a thrust unit for powered flight and a missile body for overall missile control and payload delivery on target. During powered flight, Redstone burned a fuel mixture of 25 percent water–75 percent ethyl alcohol with liquid oxygen (LOX) used as the oxidizer. Later Redstones used Hydyne, 60% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and 40% diethylenetriamine (DETA), as the fuel. The missile body consisted of an aft unit containing the instrument compartment, and the warhead unit containing the payload compartment and the radar altimeter fuze. The missile body was separated from the thrust unit 20–30 seconds after the termination of powered flight, as determined by the preset range to target. The body continued on a controlled ballistic trajectory to the target impact point. The thrust unit continued on its own uncontrolled ballistic trajectory, impacting short of the designated target.

The nuclear-armed Redstone carried the W39, either a MK 39Y1 Mod 1 or MK 39Y2 Mod 1, warhead with a yield of 3.8 megatons.

==Production==
Chrysler Corporation was awarded the prime production contract, to be made at the newly renamed Michigan Ordnance Missile Plant in Warren, Michigan. The navy-owned facility was previously known as the Naval Industrial Reserve Aircraft Plant used for jet engine production. Following the cancellation of a planned jet engine program, the facility was made available to the Chrysler Corporation for missile production, and began missile and support equipment production in 1952. Rocketdyne Division of North American Aviation Company provided the rocket engines; Ford Instrument Company, division of Sperry Rand Corporation, produced the guidance and control systems; and Reynolds Metals Company fabricated fuselage assemblies as subcontractors to Chrysler.

==Redstone derivatives==
In 1955, the Jupiter-C rocket (not to be confused with the later, unrelated Jupiter IRBM) was developed as an enhanced Redstone for atmospheric and reentry vehicle tests. It had elongated propellant tanks for increased burn time and a new engine that burned a fuel mixture known as hydyne and under the name of the Jupiter C/Juno 1 was used for the first successful US space launch of the Explorer 1 satellite in 1958.

The Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle was a derivation of the Redstone with a fuel tank increased in length by and was used on 5 May 1961 to launch Alan Shepard on his sub-orbital flight to become the second person and first American in space. It retained the Jupiter C&#x27;s longer propellant tanks, but went back to using ethyl alcohol/water for propellant instead of hydyne.
From 1966 to 1967, a series of surplus modified Redstones called Spartas were launched from Woomera, South Australia, as part of a joint U.S.–United Kingdom–Australian research program aimed at understanding re-entry phenomena. These Redstones had two solid fuel upper stages added. The U.S. donated a spare Sparta for Australia&#x27;s first satellite launch, WRESAT, in November 1967.

<doc id="213459" wikidata="Q1132247" url="?curid=213459" title="Duke of Gloucester">
<text>Duke of Gloucester ( ) is a British royal title (after Gloucester), often conferred on one of the sons of the reigning monarch. The first four creations were in the Peerage of England and the last in the Peerage of the United Kingdom; the current creation carries with it the subsidiary titles of Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden.

The title was first conferred on Thomas of Woodstock, the thirteenth child of King Edward III. The title became extinct at his death, as it did upon the death of the duke of the second creation, Humphrey of Lancaster, fourth son of King Henry IV.

The title was next conferred on Richard, brother to King Edward IV. When Richard himself became king, the dukedom merged into the crown. After Richard&#x27;s death, the title was considered ominous, since the first three such dukes had all died without issue to inherit their titles. The title was not awarded for over 150 years: the next to receive the dukedom was the son of King Charles I, Henry Stuart, upon whose death the title again became extinct.

Prince William, son of the future Queen Anne, was styled &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot; for his whole life (1689–1700), but was never formally created duke. Frederick, Prince of Wales, was styled &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot; from 1718–1726, but was then created Duke of Edinburgh rather than of Gloucester.

There was next a creation of a double dukedom (not two dukedoms) for the brother of King George III, Prince William Henry, his proper title becoming &quot;Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh&quot;.

The fifth and most recent creation was for Prince Henry, third son of King George V, styled as &quot;His Royal Highness The Duke of Gloucester&quot;. Upon Prince Henry&#x27;s death, the dukedom was inherited by his only surviving son Prince Richard, who still holds the title. The heir-apparent to the title is Alexander Windsor, styled Earl of Ulster. The next in the line of succession is the Earl of Ulster&#x27;s son Xan Windsor, known by his grandfather&#x27;s third title of Lord Culloden.
The royal dukedom will devolve into an ordinary one when inherited by Alexander Windsor; as a great-grandson of a sovereign he is not entitled to royal style, and will be styled as &quot;His Grace The Duke of Gloucester&quot;.

<doc id="213461" wikidata="Q1571476" url="?curid=213461" title="Flamin' Groovies">
<text>Flamin&#x27; Groovies is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1965, originally co-led by Roy Loney and Cyril Jordan. After the Groovies released three albums, on Epic (&quot;Supersnazz&quot;) and Kama Sutra (&quot;Flamingo&quot; and &quot;Teenage Head&quot;), Loney left the band in 1971. He was replaced as co-leader by Chris Wilson, and the band&#x27;s emphasis shifted more toward British Invasion power pop.

The band signed to United Artists Records in 1972, releasing just three more singles until 1976. The Groovies then signed to Sire Records and released three albums between 1976 and 1979, &quot;Shake Some Action&quot;, &quot;Flamin&#x27; Groovies Now&quot; (both produced by Dave Edmunds at Rockfield Studios in Wales) and &quot;Jumpin&#x27; in the Night&quot;. The 1976 album&#x27;s title track &quot;Shake Some Action&quot; (also released as a single) became a power pop anthem and is revered by many, including Greil Marcus in his book, &quot;The History of Rock and Roll in Ten Songs&quot;. Wilson left the band in 1981, and the band continued in various forms, including the release of three more albums, before breaking up in 1991. After a couple of limited reunions with different lineups, the 1970s nucleus of Jordan, Wilson, and Alexander reformed the group in 2013, and the band&#x27;s first post-reunion album, &quot;Fantastic Plastic&quot;, was released in 2017. Alexander left the reformed band in 2017, and in 2019 Wilson went on hiatus.

In addition to the band&#x27;s role in the advancement of power pop, the Flamin&#x27; Groovies have also been called one of the forerunners of punk rock.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Roy Loney and Tim Lynch, who met in first grade, had put together a Kingston Trio-type folk band with guitars when they were in junior high and high school. Beginning in 1965, after adding their friend George Alexander (whom they told to learn bass), they became a Rolling Stones-influenced rock band with drummer Ron Greco. Greco knew a 15-year-old lead guitarist named Cyril Jordan, who quickly became a part of the group, although Greco then left and was replaced by Danny Mihm. After playing together for about three years under various group names and not getting any record company offers, they decided to put up their own money and make their own EP, which they could also use as a label demo. That EP, 1968&#x27;s &quot;Sneakers&quot;, was recorded on 4-track and mixed in about eight hours total and featured Jordan (guitar, vocals), Loney (vocals, guitar), Alexander (bass, harmonica, vocals), Lynch (guitar, harmonica, vocals) and Mihm (drums). As a result of its success, they were signed to a contract by Epic Records. Around the same time, their manager leased The Fillmore from Bill Graham, and they became managers of the venue. 

During a stay in Detroit, the band would be exposed to local bands such as MC5, the Stooges, and the Frost, which caused the Groovies&#x27; sound to become heavier. During this period, they released 1969&#x27;s &quot;Supersnazz&quot;. In Loney&#x27;s words, the album was &quot;all over the map&quot; and &quot;kinda grasping at every possible straw&quot;; it contained both re-creations of 1950s rock and roll and more melodic songs that anticipated the power pop movement of the 1970s—a genre to which the Flamin&#x27; Groovies would eventually contribute significant work. However, the album&#x27;s low sales led to their release by Epic. They then started doing national tours, and their further exposure to Detroit&#x27;s musical scene &quot;hardened up our sound a whole lot&quot;, in Loney&#x27;s words. 

At the instigation of Richard Robinson (a journalist and the Groovies&#x27; future producer), the Groovies then signed to Kama Sutra Records for their next two albums, 1970&#x27;s &quot;Flamingo&quot; and 1971&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Head&quot;. Jordan was unhappy with the sound quality of &quot;Flamingo&quot;.&quot; &quot;Teenage Head&quot; is listed in the 2006 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and Mick Jagger reportedly compared the album favorably to the Rolling Stones&#x27; contemporaneous &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;. 

Despite the critical plaudits, though, neither album sold well, which caused Loney and Lynch to lose interest and left the Groovies in limbo about their future. Loney and Jordan clashed over the band&#x27;s direction, due to the former&#x27;s preference for rock and rockabilly and the latter&#x27;s interest in pop acts such as the Beatles. Jordan, however, felt the band was just evolving. Tim Lynch then left the band and was replaced by James Ferrell, shortly before the Groovies played a concert for the closing of the Fillmore West that was broadcast live on local San Francisco radio station KSAN.

===Isolation and success===
Not long after the KSAN concert, Loney also left the band and was replaced by 18-year-old singer and guitarist Chris Wilson, who, along with Jordan, began to move the group in a more overtly power pop direction. Alexander had become friends with British music executive Andrew Lauder, and in 1972, the band reached a deal to sign with Lauder&#x27;s United Artists Records (&quot;UA&quot;) and to record with British producer Dave Edmunds at Rockfield Studios in Wales, even though the U.S. division of UA had already turned down the band. The Groovies moved to Britain, where they remained for the rest of 1972, but the UA deal was never expanded beyond two single releases, &quot;Slow Death&quot;/&quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot; and &quot;Married Woman&quot;/&quot;Get a Shot of Rhythm and Blues&quot;, which United Artists preferred to Edmunds and the band&#x27;s choices &quot;Shake Some Action&quot; and &quot;You Tore Me Down&quot;. However, &quot;Slow Death&quot;, an anti-drug song that Jordan had written with Loney, was banned by the BBC for using the word &quot;morphine&quot;, which killed the momentum behind the signing. All seven songs recorded in 1972 by the Groovies for UA (the six named above plus Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Little Queenie&quot;) were released in 1995 by EMI on the &quot;A Bucket of Brains&quot; album.

The failure of these singles effectively left the band in limbo for two years. During this lull, drummer Danny Mihm also left the band, replaced first by Terry Rae and ultimately by David Wright. In 1973, the Groovies re-recorded &quot;Shake Some Action&quot; as part of a deal with Capitol Records, but executive turnover at Capitol blocked that deal before the contracts were signed. In an effort to gain some leverage, the band agreed to release the Edmunds-produced version of &quot;You Tore Me Down&quot; as the first single on the brand-new Bomp! Records label in 1974. Some of the various released and unreleased recordings made and produced by the Groovies during this period (six demos from 1971, &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot; from 1972, one TV recording from 1972, and the two Capitol demos from 1973) were later collected on the 2002 Norton album &quot;Slow Death&quot;.

Finally, in 1975, Greg Shaw from Bomp! became the Flamin&#x27; Groovies&#x27; manager and arranged for them to sign to the new (but poorly distributed) label Sire Records, headed by Seymour Stein. Due to that, the Groovies returned to the UK and recorded and released (in 1976) &quot;Shake Some Action&quot;, again produced by Edmunds, which included the same recordings of two songs (&quot;Shake Some Action&quot; and &quot;You Tore Me Down&quot;) that United Artists had passed on in 1972 but Stein loved. The album received rave critical reviews, similar to &quot;Teenage Head&quot;. The Groovies continued to tour continually and were supported by the Ramones and The Stranglers at the Roundhouse in London on July 4, 1976 (which was coincidentally the US&#x27;s bicentennial) in the former band&#x27;s first ever appearance in the UK. This concert has been widely noted as a seminal moment in the development of punk rock.

Sire&#x27;s distribution was taken over by Warner Bros. Records in 1977, and so the Groovies returned to a major label; however, shortly before that, James Ferrell, who had been unhappy with the band&#x27;s &quot;Beatle-esque&quot; direction, was fired and replaced by Mike Wilhelm, who had previously played with Wilson in the San Francisco band &quot;Loose Gravel&quot;. The band then recorded two albums for Sire/Warners, 1978&#x27;s &quot;Flamin&#x27; Groovies Now&quot;, once more produced by Dave Edmunds, and 1979&#x27;s &quot;Jumpin&#x27; in the Night&quot;, produced by Jordan and Roger Bechirian. Wilson felt that &quot;Now&quot; was his favorite album and the band with Edmunds was in &quot;one of our most creative times&quot;. However, Sire gave the album little promotion, and it didn&#x27;t sell appreciably better. Edmunds also intended to produce &quot;Jumpin&#x27; in the Night&quot;, but, according to Wilson, his new manager Jake Riviera blocked him from doing so. Both albums included several covers of older material from other artists, which became an issue between Jordan, who wanted to include the covers (because he was trying to renegotiate his publishing rights with Sire), and Wilson, who did not. According to Jordan, during this period Warners also released a punk rock songbook that featured the Sex Pistols. the Ramones, and the Groovies.

===Breakup===
The commercial failure of &quot;Jumpin&#x27; in the Night&quot;, as well as clashes between Jordan and Stein, led Sire to drop the Flamin&#x27; Groovies in 1980, although the band nevertheless added keyboardist Mark Dunwoody. Then, a failed recording session at Gold Star Studios in 1981 for a new album tentatively called &quot;Tour de Force&quot; (in which only five complete songs were recorded in a three-week period, but four of them were covers) and the widening personal differences between Jordan and Wilson led both David Wright and Chris Wilson to quit the Groovies, with Wilson&#x27;s departure taking place on Halloween night 1981. Wilson called the Gold Star sessions &quot;a complete debacle&quot; and referred to the time as being &quot;like a messy family divorce&quot;; all of the Groovies blamed the collapse of the Gold Star sessions on excessive drug use. As Jordan admitted, &quot;We got tired. We were beaten up and cast aside, and the feeling was that this thing’s over, and you couldn’t stop that feeling with anybody in the band because it looked like it was.&quot; Despite that, Jordan and Alexander added new members, including the return of drummer Danny Mihm, and resumed touring.

However, after Wilhelm, Mihm and Dunwoody all left in 1982, the Flamin&#x27; Groovies once again had to reform. Later in the 1980s, the Groovies, now including Jordan, Alexander, guitarist-vocalist Jack Johnson, and drummer Paul Zahl, became involved with an Australian promoter named Peter Noble (the owner of AIM Records), who began to issue various Groovies live and studio recordings and reissue prior albums. After a 1987 live-in-the-studio recording in Australia for AIM entitled &quot;One Night Stand&quot;, and Sire/Warner&#x27;s release of a 1989 greatest hits album focused on the Jordan-Wilson recordings entitled &quot;Groovies&#x27; Greatest Grooves&quot;, Noble put the Groovies on a financially mismanaged 80-day, 80-city tour of Europe, which shattered the group. The Groovies finally disbanded in 1991, with their last releases being the AIM compilation of demos entitled &quot;Step Up&quot; in 1991 and the post-breakup album &quot;Rock Juice&quot; (which used several of the same backing tracks as &quot;Step Up&quot;, according to Alexander) in 1993.

===Post-breakup and partial reunions===
In 1979, Roy Loney formed the Phantom Movers featuring two other former Groovies, drummer Danny Mihm and guitarist James Ferrell, as well as Larry Lea (guitar) and Maurice Tani (bass). The band released several albums between 1979 and 1993 as well as a greatest hits CD (&quot;A Hundred Miles an Hour 1978-1989&quot; on the Raven label out of Australia). Loney and Lea continued to work together after the band folded.

In 1995, &quot;Shake Some Action&quot; appeared in the movie &quot;Clueless&quot;, which regenerated interest in the group. Loney, Mihm and Ferrell, who were then playing together in a band called the Fondellas, tried to put a Groovies reunion together to capitalize on that interest, which had been further fueled by re-releases of &quot;Flamingo&quot; and &quot;Teenage Head&quot;, but Jordan wasn&#x27;t interested at that time.

The Flamin&#x27; Groovies headlined the Azkena Rock Festival in Mendizabala, Spain, on September 11, 2004, although Jordan was the only member of the pre-1981 band who participated.

In 2005, Jordan founded a new band, Magic Christian, which released a self-titled double album in 2005 and the album &quot;Evolver&quot; in 2009.

In 2009, Loney and Jordan reunited and embarked on a brief tour, backed by members of the A-Bones and Yo La Tengo, including the Ponderosa Stomp in April. The tour focused on the Groovies&#x27; pre-1972 catalog, omitting the later songs; Jordan noted that, despite the band&#x27;s continuing popularity, &quot;when I did that tour with Roy, . . . the halls didn’t exactly fill up.&quot; During an English date on this tour, Jordan reconnected with Wilson, who was then living in England (and who had joined The Barracudas and the Fortunate Sons there in the 1980s after leaving the Groovies).

One result of the Loney/Jordan tour were more reunions on the 2010 Chris Wilson album &quot;Love Over Money&quot;. George Alexander, Roy Loney, James Ferrell and Mike Wilhelm all appear on the CD, as does Procol Harum&#x27;s keyboard legend Matthew Fisher and Barracudas guitarist Robin Wills. The album was released on the French label Rock Paradise. Wilson then followed this up with the 2013 album &quot;It&#x27;s Flamin&#x27; Groovy&quot;, which featured the same musicians as previously plus three songs with both Alexander and Cyril Jordan.

1980s Groovies keyboardist Mark Dunwoody, who also played with the Phantom Movers, died of a heart attack on June 12, 2013. Guitarist Mike Wilhelm (1976-1982) died from cancer on May 14, 2019. Drummer Danny Mihm died on March 26, 2020, following a stroke.

===Reunion===
Beginning in late 2012, following the &quot;reunions&quot; on Wilson&#x27;s solo albums, Jordan and Wilson considered reforming and relaunching the band. Said Jordan, &quot;the Flamin&#x27; Groovies &quot;Shake Some Action&quot; version makes way more money and did make way more money in the &#x27;70s than the Roy Loney version ever did. So it was a no-brainer to put that second version back together again and see if we could make some good money.&quot; That second Groovies line-up of Jordan, Wilson, and Alexander (with the addition of Victor Penalosa on drums) played live for the first time since their 1981 split in Australia (Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth) as part of the Hoodoo Gurus&#x27; invitational &quot;Dig It Up&quot; in April 2013. Jordan noted that the band received $75,000 for six or seven shows on the tour, which was enough money to overcome the band&#x27;s post-breakup geographic spread. The Groovies then played a series of sold-out shows in Japan. Their next show, in San Francisco at The Elbo Room on May 4, sold out in less than 24 hours, and Loney even attended.

As a result, Jordan, Wilson, and Alexander decided to reform the Flamin&#x27; Groovies and to record a new album. Their first release was a limited-edition single (on vinyl) in 2016 to commemorate the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary entitled &quot;Crazy Macy&quot; b/w &quot;Let Me Rock&quot;, followed by the album &quot;Fantastic Plastic&quot;, which was released in September 2017. The reformed band also did an East Coast, European, and Midwest tour behind the new album, with Jordan and Wilson accompanied by Chris Von Sneidern on bass and Tony Sales (son of bassist Tony Fox Sales) on drums. In 2019, the Groovies, consisting of Jordan, Von Sneidern (now on guitar), Sales, and Atom Ellis (on bass), with special guest Roy Loney (vocals) but without Wilson (who was on hiatus in 2019), embarked on the &quot;Teenage Head Tour&quot; in the US and Europe. However, Loney was hospitalized after a fall at the airport in June, just as the tour was headed to Europe, which forced the European leg of the tour to continue without him. Loney died on December 13, 2019. Despite Loney&#x27;s death, the band continued to remain active, releasing a recording of &quot;Fissure of Rolando&quot; in 2023 and continuing to go on tour.

<text>2046 is a 2004 film written, produced and directed by Wong Kar-wai. An international co-production between Hong Kong, France, Italy, China and Germany, it is a loose sequel to Wong&#x27;s films &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1990) and &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000). It follows the aftermath of Chow Mo-wan&#x27;s unconsummated affair with Su Li-zhen in 1960s Hong Kong.

==Plot==

There are four main story arcs, listed in approximate order below. In typical Wong fashion, they are presented in non-chronological parts. Knowledge of &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; and &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; is assumed, but not necessary to understand 2046.

===2046 Part I===

Returning to Hong Kong after years in Singapore, Chow has become a suave ladies&#x27; man to cover up his pain from losing Su. Chow meets Lulu taking her home but accidentally keeps her room key. Upon returning the key, Chow later learns that Lulu was stabbed the night before by a jealous boyfriend.

===Wang Jing-wen and Wang Jie-wen Part I===

The landlord&#x27;s daughter Jing-wen is seeing a man her father strongly opposes. Eventually, Jing-wen breaks up with him. The next tenant is Jing-wen&#x27;s younger sister Jie-wen who attempts and fails to seduce Chow. Soon after, Chow runs into financial difficulties so he starts writing a series.

===Bai Ling Part I===

Bai Ling, a nightclub ballroom dancer seeking a long-term relationship. Bai runs into Chow after her boyfriend leaves her before a planned trip to Singapore and they become friends. The relationship quickly turns sexual. Chow wants to keep the relationship purely physical, continuing to see other prostitutes; when Bai realizes she has feelings for Chow and asks for exclusivity, Chow refuses and they break up. Bai then returns to prostitution.

===Jing-wen Part II===

After Bai leaves, Jing-wen is released from institutional care and still depressed over her previous relationship. Chow develops feelings for Jing-wen and attempts a relationship but nothing develops as she is still in love with her previous lover.

===Jing-wen Part III===

Jing-wen gets engaged. Depressed over the loss of Jing-wen, Chow runs into Bai Ling and believes she is likely to remain content with her misery. He resolves to get over Su.

===Bai Part II===

Some time later, Bai calls Chow and they go out to dinner. She informs Chow of her plans to leave for Singapore, asking for a reference.

===Su Arc===

Chow met Su after arriving in Singapore, financially spent. Su agrees to help him win money so he can return to Hong Kong and they become lovers. When he asks Su to return to Hong Kong with him, Su challenges him to a final draw that Chow loses, and so she refuses to go with him and also refuses to tell him why.

When Chow returns to Singapore to visit her a second time, he does not find her and hears rumors that Su either returned to Cambodia or was killed.

===Bai Part III===

The night before Bai leaves for Singapore, Chow dines with her again. She insists on paying for dinner and hands him a stack of cash, each $10 bill representing a night they spent together. After dinner, Chow walks her back to her apartment and Bai begs him to spend the night. He cannot, and leaves by taxi.

==Production==
It took four years to complete the film. During that time, production was closed because of the SARS epidemic in March 2003.

It was picked up by Sony Pictures Classics for distribution in the United States, and was released on 5 August 2005.

==Title==
2046 has its own significance for Hong Kong, as it is 49 years after the handover of Hong Kong by the British on 1 July 1997. At the time of handover, the Mainland government promised fifty years of self-regulation for the former British colony. 2046 references before Hong Kong&#x27;s special, self-regulated status ends.

==Critical reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Director Wong Kar-Wai has created in &quot;2046&quot; another visually stunning, atmospheric, and melancholy movie about unrequited love and loneliness.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 34 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

One of the most positive reviews came from Manohla Dargis in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who called the film &quot;an unqualified triumph&quot;, and praised Zhang Ziyi&#x27;s performance, saying: &quot;Ms. Zhang&#x27;s shockingly intense performance burns a hole in the film that gives everything, including all the other relationships, a sense of terrific urgency.&quot; Dargis also describes the film:&quot;Routinely criticized for his weak narratives, Mr. Wong is one of the few filmmakers working in commercial cinema who refuse to be enslaved by traditional storytelling. He isn&#x27;t the first and certainly not the only one to pry cinema from the grip of classical narrative, to take a pickax to the usual three-act architecture (or at least shake the foundation), while also dispatching with the art-deadening requirements (redemption, closure, ad nauseam) that have turned much of Big Hollywood into a creative dead zone. Like some avant-garde filmmakers and like his contemporary, Hou Hsiao-hsien of Taiwan, among precious few others these days, Mr. Wong makes movies, still a young art, that create meaning through visual images, not just words.&quot; 

In &quot;Premiere&quot;, Glenn Kenny gave the film four stars and ranked it as one of the ten best films of 2005:&quot;Insanely evocative &#x27;60s-style landscapes and settings share screen space with claustrophobic futuristic CGI metropolises; everyone smokes and drinks too much; musical themes repeat as characters get stuck in their own self-defeating modes of eternal return. A puzzle, a valentine, a sacred hymn to beauty, particularly that of Ziyi Zhang, almost preternaturally gorgeous and delivering an ineffable performance, and a cynical shrug of the shoulders at the damned impermanence of it all, &quot;2046&quot; is a movie to live in.&quot;

Said Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;:&quot;Is it worth the challenge? Of course it is. Wong stands as the leading heir to the great directors of post-WWII Europe: His work combines the playfulness and disenchantment of Godard, the visual fantasias of Fellini, the chic existentialism of Antonioni, and Bergman&#x27;s brooding uncertainties. In this film, he drills further into an obsession with memory, time, and longing than may even be good for him, and his world reflects and refracts our own more than may be comfortable for us.&quot;

Daniel Eagan of &quot;Film Journal International&quot;:&quot;it&#x27;s clear his [Wong Kar-wai] skills and interests have no match in today&#x27;s cinema. Whatever his motives, Wong has assembled a remarkable team for this film. The cinematography, production design and editing combine for a mood of utter languor and decadence. Leung Chiu-wai continues his string of outstanding roles, while pop singer Wong achieves a gravity missing from her earlier work...it&#x27;s Zhang who is the real surprise here...her performance puts her on a level with the world&#x27;s best actresses.&quot; 

One of the less enthusiastic reviews came from Roger Ebert who, in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film a mildly-negative 2½ stars out of a possible four and a &quot;marginal thumbs down&quot; on the television show &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;.&quot;&quot;2046&quot; arrived at the last minute at Cannes 2003, after missing its earlier screenings; the final reel reportedly arrived at the airport almost as the first was being shown. It was said to be unfinished, and indeed there were skeletal special effects that now appear in final form, but perhaps it was never really finished in his mind. Perhaps he would have appreciated the luxury that Woody Allen had with &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;; he looked at the first cut of the film, threw out the first act, called the actors back and reshot, focusing on what turned out to be the central story. Watching &quot;2046&quot;, I wonder what it could possibly mean to anyone not familiar with Wong&#x27;s work and style. Unlike &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;, it is not a self-contained film, although it&#x27;s certainly a lovely meander.&quot;

The official journal of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, &quot;Film Comment&quot;&#x27;s 2005 end-of-the-year film critics&#x27; poll, placed the film as the second best film of that year, with 668 points. &quot;2046&quot; was called the best film of 2005 by Michael Atkinson (&quot;The Village Voice&quot;), Daryl Chin (Journal of Performance and Art), Josef Brown (&quot;Vue Weekly&quot;), Sean Burns (&quot;Philadelphia Weekly&quot;), Will Sloan (&quot;The Martingrove Beacon&quot;), and Justine Elias (&quot;The Guardian&quot;), and was ranked among the top ten best films of the year by Manohla Dargis (&quot;The New York Times&quot;), Richard Corliss (&quot;Time Magazine&quot;), Same Adams (&quot;Philadelphia City Paper&quot;), Leslie Camhi (&quot;The Village Voice&quot;), Jason Anderson (&quot;eye Weekly&quot;), Gary Dretzka (&quot;Movie City News&quot;), Godfrey Cheshire (&quot;The Independent Weekly&quot;), Ty Burr (&quot;The Boston Globe&quot;), Liza Bear (&quot;indieWIRE&quot;), Edward Crouse (&quot;The Village Voice&quot;), Jeffrey M. Anderson (&quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;), John DeFore (&quot;Austin American Statesman&quot;), Brian Brooks (&quot;indieWIRE&quot;), Chris Barsanti (Filmcritic.com), F.X. Feeney (&quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;), David Ehrenstein (&quot;New Times&quot;), J. Hoberman (&quot;The Village Voice&quot;), Robert Horton (&quot;Everett Herald&quot;), Bilge Ebiri (&quot;Nerve&quot;), and Eugene Hernandez (&quot;indieWIRE&quot;).

==Box office and distribution==

&quot;2046&quot; opened in North America on 5 August 2005, where it grossed US$113,074 on four screens ($28,268 average). In Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s home country of Hong Kong, &quot;2046&quot; earned a total of US$778,138. It went on to gross a total of $1,444,588 in North America, playing at 61 venues at its widest release. Its total worldwide box office gross is US$19,271,312.

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on DVD on 26 December 2005. Since then, it has yet to be re-released or restored in the United States. A region free Blu-ray was released by EOS Entertainment on 17 September 2014 in South Korea, as part of a Wong Kar Wai boxset.

<text>Alphonse Floristan Picou (October 19, 1878 – February 4, 1961) was an important very early American jazz clarinetist, who also wrote and arranged music. He was born and died in New Orleans, Louisiana.

==Early life and education==
Alphonse Picou was born into a prosperous middle-class Creole of Color family in downtown New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. His parents were Alfred Picou and Clotilde (Serpas) Picou, who also had other children: Cecilia, Willie, Feriol, Joseph, and Philomene Picou.

==Career==

By the age of 16, he was working as a professional musician on both the guitar and clarinet, but then concentrated on the latter instrument. As his family frowned on music being a person&#x27;s sole trade, Picou trained and worked as a tinsmith, including putting the copper sheeting on church steeples. Soon Picou was so much in demand as a clarinetist that he made most of his living from music. 

He played classical music with the Creole section&#x27;s Lyre Club Symphony Orchestra. He also played with various dance bands and brass bands, including those of Bouboul Fortunea Augustat, Bouboul Valentin, Oscar DuConge, Manuel Perez, Freddie Keppard, Bunk Johnson, the Excelsior Brass Band, the Olympia Brass Band and others. The light-skinned Picou, with majority European ancestry, sometimes worked with white bands as well in his youth, including at least on occasion with Papa Jack Laine. (This opportunity was not available to musicians with darker skin due to racial discrimination in the U.S. Southern States at the time.)

Picou was one of the early musicians playing in the new style that was developing in the city, not yet known as &quot;jazz&quot;. He sometimes played in the band of Buddy Bolden, perhaps the most important force in the musical change.

Many younger clarinetists, including Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone, cited Picou as an important influence. Picou&#x27;s style (those who knew him for many years said that his style when he recorded was little changed from how he had played early in the 20th century) is lilting with a gentle raggy feel. His subtle variations are usually more melodic embellishments than what would later be called improvisation. His style struck many who heard Picou late in his career as either &quot;not quite jazz&quot; or &quot;just barely jazz&quot;.

Picou is perhaps best known for originating the clarinet part on the standard &quot;High Society&quot;. Some have mistakenly stated that he wrote the number, which was a 1901 marching band composition by Porter Steele. Picou rearranged it giving it a gentle swing and paraphrased the piccolo part to create his famous clarinet solo. This became a local standard part, and no younger New Orleans clarinetist was considered proficient until he could play a duplication of Picou&#x27;s part. Unusually in a music that values improvisation, it became a set piece. Commonly, later clarinetists would solo once through reproducing or sticking close to Picou&#x27;s solo, and then do their own improvisations on a second solo.

He often played on an unusual Albert Penzel-Mueler alto clarinet with the horn bent upwards instead of straight ahead. It can be seen on several photos of Picou and is displayed at the Historic New Orleans Collection.

Alphonse Picou at least once followed fellow musicians up north to Chicago about 1917–1918 (and possibly briefly to New York City in the early 1920s), but said he did not like life up North. He spent most of his career in his home city.

&quot;King&quot; Joe Oliver commissioned Picou to write new tunes for his band. Picou&#x27;s compositions include &quot;Alligator Hop&quot;, and &quot;Olympia Rag&quot;.

During the Great Depression, Picou returned to metal smithing. In the 1940s, he was able to return to playing professionally regularly, made his first recordings, and opened a bar in a building he owned on Claiborne Avenue. For years into the 1950s, he was a regular on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter with Papa Celestin&#x27;s Band (with whom he also did radio broadcasts) and leading his own group.

Picou&#x27;s funeral procession in 1961, was one of the largest the city had seen, with several brass bands and many additional musicians playing Picou a sendoff. Though Picou was a Catholic, the service was conducted by a Baptist minister.

<doc id="213468" wikidata="Q10578" url="?curid=213468" title="Hydra (constellation)">
<text>Hydra is the largest of the 88 modern constellations, measuring 1303 square degrees, and also the longest at over 100 degrees. Its southern end borders Libra and Centaurus and its northern end borders Cancer. It was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. Commonly represented as a water snake, it straddles the celestial equator.

== History and mythology==

=== Western mythology ===

The Greek constellation of Hydra is an adaptation of a Babylonian constellation: the MUL.APIN includes a &quot;serpent&quot; constellation (MUL.DINGIR.MUŠ) that loosely corresponds to Hydra. It is one of two Babylonian &quot;serpent&quot; constellations (the other being the origin of the Greek Serpens), a mythological hybrid of serpent, lion and bird.

The shape of Hydra resembles a twisting snake, and features as such in some Greek myths. One myth associates it with a water snake that a crow served Apollo in a cup when it was sent to fetch water. Apollo saw through the fraud and angrily cast the crow, cup and snake into the sky. It is also associated with the monster Hydra, with its many heads, killed by Hercules, represented in another constellation. According to legend, if one of the Hydra&#x27;s heads was cut off, two more would grow in its place. However, Hercules&#x27; nephew, Iolaus, seared the necks with a torch to prevent them from growing back and thus enabled Hercules to overcome the Hydra.

=== Mythology and equivalents in other cultures ===
In Chinese astronomy, the stars that correspond to Hydra are located within the Vermilion Bird and the Azure Dragon. The head of Hydra was collectively known as &quot;Min al Az&#x27;al,&quot; meaning &quot;belonging to the uninhabited spot&quot; in Arabic.

== Features ==
=== Stars ===

Despite its size, Hydra contains only one moderately bright star, Alphard, designated Alpha Hydrae. It is an orange giant of magnitude 2.0, 177 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means &quot;the solitary one&quot;. Beta Hydrae is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.3, 365 light-years from Earth. Gamma Hydrae is a yellow giant of magnitude 3.0, 132 light-years from Earth.

Hydra has one bright binary star, Epsilon Hydrae, which is difficult to split in amateur telescopes; it has a period of 1000 years and is 135 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 3.4 and the secondary is a blue star of magnitude 6.7. However, there are several dimmer double stars and binary stars in Hydra. 27 Hydrae is a triple star with two components visible in binoculars and three visible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.8, 244 light-years from Earth. The secondary, a binary star, appears in binoculars at magnitude 7.0 but is composed of a magnitude 7 and a magnitude 11 star; it is 202 light-years from Earth. 54 Hydrae is a binary star 99 light-years from Earth, easily divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is a purple star of magnitude 7.4. N Hydrae (N Hya) is a pair of stars of magnitudes 5.8 and 5.9. Struve 1270 (Σ1270) consists of a pair of stars, magnitudes 6.4 and 7.4.

The other main named star in Hydra is Sigma Hydrae (σ Hydrae), which also has the name of Minchir, from the Arabic for snake&#x27;s nose. At magnitude 4.54, it is rather dim. The head of the snake corresponds to the Āshleshā Nakshatra, the lunar zodiacal constellation in Indian astronomy. The name of Nakshatra (Ashlesha) became the proper name of Epsilon Hydrae since 1 June 2018 by IAU.

Hydra is also home to several variable stars. R Hydrae is a Mira variable star 2000 light-years from Earth; it is one of the brightest Mira variables at its maximum of magnitude 3.5. It has a minimum magnitude of 10 and a period of 390 days. V Hydrae is an unusually vivid red variable star 20,000 light-years from Earth. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.0 to a maximum of 6.6. U Hydrae is a semi-regular variable star with a deep red color, 528 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 6.6 and a maximum magnitude of 4.2; its period is 115 days.

Hydra includes GJ 357, an M-type main sequence star located only 31 light-years from the Solar System. This star has three confirmed exoplanets in its orbit, one of which, GJ 357 d, is considered to be a &quot;Super-Earth&quot; within the circumstellar habitable zone.

The constellation also contains the radio source Hydra A galaxy as well as nearby WISE 0855−0714 brown dwarf being the closest (sub)stellar object of the constellation.

=== Deep-sky objects ===

Hydra contains three Messier objects. M83, also known as the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, is located on the border of Hydra and Centaurus, M68 is a globular cluster near M83, and M48 is an open star cluster in the western end of the serpent.

NGC 3242 is a planetary nebula of magnitude 7.5, 1400 light-years from Earth. Discovered in 1785 by William Herschel, it has earned the nickname &quot;Ghost of Jupiter&quot; because of its striking resemblance to the giant planet. Its blue-green disk is visible in small telescopes and its halo is visible in larger instruments.

M48 (NGC 2548) is an open cluster that is visible to the naked eye under dark skies. Its shape has been described as &quot;triangular&quot;; this 80-star cluster is unusually large, more than half a degree in diameter, larger than the diameter of the full Moon.

There are several globular clusters in Hydra. M68 (NGC 4590) is a globular cluster visible in binoculars and resolvable in medium amateur telescopes. It is 31,000 light-years from Earth and of the 8th magnitude. NGC 5694 is a globular cluster of magnitude 10.2, 105,000 light-years from Earth. Also called &quot;Tombaugh&#x27;s Globular Cluster&quot;, it is a Shapley class VII cluster; the classification indicates that it has intermediate concentration at its nucleus. Though it was discovered as a non-stellar object in 1784 by William Herschel, its status as a globular cluster was not ascertained until 1932, when Clyde Tombaugh looked at photographic plates taken of the region near Pi Hydrae on 12 May 1931.

M83 (NGC 5236), the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, is an 8th magnitude face-on spiral galaxy. It is easily observed in skies south of 40°N latitude, found by using 1, 2, 3, and 4 Centauri as guide stars. It has been host to six supernovae. Large amateur telescopes - above 12 inches aperture - reveal its spiral arms, bar, and small, bright nucleus. In a medium-sized amateur instrument, around 8 inches in aperture, the spiral arms become visible under good conditions. It is not perfectly symmetrical in the eyepiece, rather, the northwest side is flattened and the nucleus has a southwest-to-northeast bar. A smaller sister to the Milky Way, it is a grand design spiral galaxy 40,000 light-years across.

There are many other galaxies located in Hydra. NGC 3314, usually delineated as NGC 3314a and NGC 3314b, is a pair of galaxies that appear superimposed, despite the fact that they are not related or interacting in any way. The foreground galaxy, NGC 3314a, is at a distance of 140 million light-years, and is a face-on spiral galaxy. The background galaxy, NGC 3314b, is an oblique spiral galaxy, and has a nucleus that appears reddened because of NGC 3314a&#x27;s dusty disk. ESO 510-G13 is a warped spiral galaxy located 150 million light-years from Earth. Though most galactic disks are flat because of their rate of rotation, their conformation can be changed, as is the case with this galaxy. Astronomers speculate that this is due to interactions with other galaxies. NGC 5068 may be a member of the M83 group, but its identity is disputed. It has a low surface brightness and has a diameter of 4.5 arcminutes. It is not perfectly circular, rather, it is elliptical and oriented on a west-northwest/east-southeast axis. However, it is of fairly uniform brightness throughout.

Another notable galaxy is NGC 4993, an elliptical galaxy which was the source of events GW170817, GRB 170817A and SSS17a from the merger of two neutron stars.

=== Meteor showers ===
The Sigma Hydrids peak on December 6 and are a very active shower. The parent body of the Sigma Hybrids is believed to be Comet Nishimura (C/2023 P1), which was discovered in 2023 by the Japanese astronomical photographer Hideo Nishimura. The Alpha Hydrids are a minor shower that peaks between January 1 and 7.

<doc id="213471" wikidata="Q766263" url="?curid=213471" title="Chungking Express">
<text>Chungking Express is a 1994 Hong Kong anthology crime dramedy film written and directed by Wong Kar-wai. The film consists of two stories told in sequence, each about a lovesick Hong Kong policeman mulling over his relationship with a woman. The first story stars Takeshi Kaneshiro as a cop obsessed by his breakup with a woman named May and his encounter with a mysterious drug smuggler (Brigitte Lin). The second stars Tony Leung as a police officer roused from his gloom over the loss of his flight attendant girlfriend (Valerie Chow) by the attentions of a quirky snack bar worker (Faye Wong).

&quot;Chungking&quot; in the title refers to Chungking Mansions in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, a place with a reputation as Hong Kong&#x27;s dark underbelly, rife with crime, sex, and drugs. &quot;Express&quot; refers to the food stand Midnight Express in Lan Kwai Fong, an area in Central, Hong Kong.

The film premiered in Hong Kong on 14 July 1994 and received critical acclaim, especially for its direction, cinematography, and performances. Since then it has been regarded as one of Wong&#x27;s finest works, one of the best films of 1994, of the 1990s, of the 20th century, and of all time, as well as one of the best anthology films and romantic comedies ever made.

In 2022, the film appeared at number 88 on the decennial &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the greatest films of all time.
==Plot==
===First story===
Hong Kong police officer He Zhi Wu&#x27;s girlfriend, May, breaks up with him on 1 April. To verify her earnestness about ending the relationship, Zhi Wu chooses to wait for a month. Every day he buys a tin of pineapples with an expiration date of 1 May, because May enjoyed pineapples and 1 May is his birthday. Meanwhile, a woman in a blonde wig tries to survive in the drug underworld after a smuggling operation goes sour.

On 1 May, Zhi Wu approaches the woman in the blonde wig at the Bottoms Up Club. She is exhausted and falls asleep in a hotel room, leaving him to watch TV and order food. He shines her shoes before leaving her still asleep. She leaves in the morning and shoots the drug baron who set her up. Zhi Wu goes jogging and receives a message from her on his pager wishing him a happy birthday. He visits his usual food store in Chungking Mansions, where he collides with a new staff member, Faye.

===Second story===
Another police officer, Cop 663, is also dealing with a breakup—with a flight attendant. Faye secretly falls for him. One day, the flight attendant visits the food store and waits for the man. She learns it is his day off and leaves a letter for him with the store owner containing a set of keys to the officer&#x27;s apartment.

Faye tells the officer of the letter, but he delays reading it and asks the store to keep it for him. Faye uses the keys to repeatedly enter the man&#x27;s apartment to clean and redecorate. Gradually, her ploys help him cheer up. He finds Faye coming to his apartment and realises that she likes him; he arranges a date at a restaurant named California. Faye does not arrive, and the store owner, her cousin, goes to the restaurant to tell him that Faye has left for the US state of California. She leaves him a boarding pass drawn on a paper napkin dated one year later.

Faye, now a flight attendant, returns to Hong Kong. She finds that the officer has bought the food store and is converting it into a restaurant. He asks her to stay for the grand opening, and to send him a postcard if she leaves. As Faye is about to leave, he presents the boarding pass, wrinkled and water-stained, and she writes him a new one. She asks him what he wants the destination to be, to which he replies, &quot;Wherever you want to take me.&quot;

==Cast==
* Brigitte Lin as woman in blonde wig
* Takeshi Kaneshiro as Ho Chi Moo / He Zhi Wu (, Cantonese &quot;Hòh Ji-móuh&quot;), nicknamed Ah Wu (Cantonese &quot;Ah Mouh&quot;), Cop 223
* Faye Wong as Faye
* Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Cop 663
* Valerie Chow as flight attendant who breaks up with Cop 663
* Chan Kam-chuen as manager of the takeaway restaurant Midnight Express
* Thom Baker as double-crossing drug dealer
* Kwan Lee-na as Richard
* Wong Chi-Ming as man
* Leung Sun as the second May, who works at the Midnight Express
* Choh Chung-Sing as man

==Theme==
* &quot;&quot;Chungking Express&quot; tells its story of love, loss, and memory through the romance of goods&quot;. In the first story, He Zhi Wu desires closer social contacts but can only depend on desperate phone calls to May&#x27;s parents and cans of pineapples (May&#x27;s favourite food) as substitutes for actual physical and emotional contact and intimacy.
* &quot;At our closest point, we were just 0.01 cm apart from each other.&quot; 0.01 cm is an urban space of possibilities—separation or connection, strangers or friends. This is a form of urban space that is of interest to Wong—that physical gap between busy passers-by in the city. 
* &quot;In the first story, Wong suggests that the sharing of 0.01 cm in a busy city can produce an affect. In the second, the possibility of sustaining a relationship through the non-simultaneous sharing of space is posited.&quot;

==Production==

Wong Kar-wai made &quot;Chungking Express&quot; during a two-month break from editing his wuxia film &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;. He said: &quot;While I had nothing to do, I decided to make &quot;Chungking Express&quot; following my instincts&quot;, and &quot;After the very heavy stuff, heavily emphasized in &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;, I wanted to make a very light, contemporary movie, but where the characters had the same problems.&quot; Originally, Wong envisioned the stories as similar but with contrasting settings: one in Hong Kong Island in daylight, and the other in Kowloon at night. He felt that &quot;despite the difference, they are the same stories&quot;: one was about encountering love in the tight city, the other about keeping love without physical connection.

The screenplay was not finished by the time filming began; Wong finished it when filming paused over New Year. He wrote the second story in a single day. He developed a third story, about a love-sick hitman, but felt it would make &quot;Chungking Express&quot; overlong, and produced it as a separate film, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1995).

Wong wanted to film in Tsim Sha Tsui since he grew up in the area and felt a strong connection to it. He called it &quot;an area where the Chinese literally brush shoulders with westerners, and is uniquely Hong Kong.&quot; He was drawn to Chungking Mansion for its many lodgings, mix of cultures, and significance as a crime hotspot; he felt that, as a &quot;mass-populated and hyperactive place&quot;, it worked as a metaphor for Hong Kong itself.

Wong has said he is inspired by the works of Haruki Murakami. As an example, the film&#x27;s original title is &quot;&quot;, while the Chinese title of Murakami&#x27;s &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; (1987) is &quot;&quot;.

The second story was shot in Central, including Lan Kwai Fong, near the fast food shop Midnight Express. &quot;In this area, there are a lot of bars, a lot of foreign executives would hang out there after work&quot;, Wong said. The shop is where Tony Leung&#x27;s and Faye Wong&#x27;s characters meet. Wong said he was also drawn to &quot;the escalator from Central to the mid-levels. That interests me because no one has made a movie there. When we were scouting for locations we found the light there entirely appropriate.&quot; Leung&#x27;s character&#x27;s apartment was cinematographer Christopher Doyle&#x27;s apartment at the time of filming. Wong narrates the story in a fragments connected by monologues.

==Marketing==
The film&#x27;s marketing posters were designed by artist Stanley Wong, under his pseudonym &quot;Another Mountain Man&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The main recurring music for the first story is Dennis Brown&#x27;s &quot;Things in Life&quot;. The song &quot;Baroque&quot;, by Michael Galasso, is heard twice during the first story: during the opening and when Brigitte Lin&#x27;s character takes the gun in the closer. This track does not appear on the soundtrack album, but three others are similar to it: &quot;Fornication in Space&quot; (track 3), &quot;Heartbreak&quot; (track 8), and &quot;Sweet Farewell&quot; (track 9), played respectively on synth, guitar and piano.

The song &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; by The Mamas &amp; the Papas plays in key scenes in the second story, which also features Faye Wong&#x27;s Cantonese cover of &quot;Dreams&quot; by The Cranberries, which is also played over the end credits (titled &quot;Mung Zung Yan&quot;, it is included in her 1994 album &quot;Random Thoughts&quot;, while her next album, &quot;Sky&quot;, includes a Mandarin cover).

&quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; is played numerous times by Faye Wong&#x27;s character, indicating &quot;the simultaneity of her aversion to and desire for change&quot;. &quot;What a Diff&#x27;rence a Day Made&quot;, performed by Dinah Washington, is played during a scene between Leung&#x27;s and Valerie Chow&#x27;s characters, as well as during an encounter between Leung&#x27;s and Faye Wong&#x27;s characters.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack is widely credited with introducing dream pop to the Hong-Kongese market. Bands featured in the soundtrack, including The Cranberries and Cocteau Twins, saw significant commercial success in Hong Kong after &quot;Chungking Express&quot; came out, and contemporary Canto-pop stars such as Candy Lo began adopting a more dream-pop sound, such as in Lo&#x27;s 1998 EP &quot;Don&#x27;t Have to be... Too Perfect&quot; and subsequent album &quot;Miao...&quot;.

==Distribution==
On 8 March 1996, the film began a limited theatrical run in North America through Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s Rolling Thunder distribution company under Miramax. The Region 1 DVD was distributed by Rolling Thunder as Tarantino is an admirer of Wong Kar-wai.

&quot;Chungking Express&quot; was released by The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray Disc (its first release in that format) in 2008. Criterion has since reclaimed the rights and the film is available on its streaming platform, the Criterion Channel (as of 2022). In 2021, it was remastered and rereleased by Criterion as part of its Blu-ray box set &quot;The World of Wong Kar Wai&quot;.

&quot;Chungking Express&quot; earned HK$7,678,549 during its Hong Kong run. In the United States, opening on four screens, it grossed $32,779 ($8,194 per screen) in its opening weekend. Playing at 20 theatres at its widest point, it went on to gross $600,200 total.

===Critical response and legacy===
During its release in North America, &quot;Chungking Express&quot; drew generally positive, sometimes ecstatic reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 65 reviews, and an average rating of 7.80/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Even if all it had to offer were writer-director Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s thrillingly distinctive visuals, &quot;Chungking Express&quot; would be well worth watching; happily, its thoughtfully drawn characters and naturalistic performances also pack a potent dramatic wallop.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 18 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert was measured in his praise (giving the film three out of four stars):

This is the kind of movie you&#x27;ll relate to if you love film itself, rather than its surface aspects such as story and stars. It&#x27;s not a movie for casual audiences, and it may not reveal all its secrets the first time through . . .

If you are attentive to the style, if you think about what Wong is doing, &quot;Chungking Express&quot; works. If you&#x27;re trying to follow the plot, you may feel frustrated ... When Godard was hot, in the 1960s and early 1970s, there was an audience for this style, but in those days, there were still film societies and repertory theaters to build and nourish such audiences. Many of today&#x27;s younger filmgoers, fed only by the narrow selections at video stores, are not as curious or knowledgeable and may simply be puzzled by &quot;Chungking Express&quot; instead of challenged. It needs to be said, in any event, that a film like this is largely a cerebral experience: You enjoy it because of what you know about film, not because of what it knows about life.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers praised the film as both &quot;exasperating and exhilarating&quot;:

There is no mistaking Wong&#x27;s talent. His hypnotic images of love and loss finally wear down your resistance as seemingly discordant sights and sounds coalesce into a radiant, crazy quilt that can make you laugh in awe at its technical wizardry in one scene and pierce your heart in the next.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s MTV-like &quot;aggressive energy&quot;:

Mr. Wong has legitimate visual flair, but his characters spend an awful lot of time playing impish tricks. A film in which a man talks to his dishtowel has an overdeveloped sense of fun.

In a 2002 poll published by &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; (the monthly magazine of the British Film Institute) asking fifty leading UK film critics to choose the ten best films from the previous 25 years, &quot;Chungking Express&quot; was placed at number eight. In the magazine&#x27;s 2012 poll to find the most acclaimed films of all time, &quot;Chungking Express&quot; ranked 144. The film was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s All-Time 100 best movies list in 2005. The film ranked 56th in BBC&#x27;s 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films voted by 209 film critics from 43 countries around the world.

Academy Award-winning director Barry Jenkins (&quot;Moonlight&quot;) is said to be influenced by this film.

<doc id="213472" wikidata="Q104814" url="?curid=213472" title="Aliens (film)">
<text>Aliens is a 1986 science fiction action film written and directed by James Cameron. It is the sequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film &quot;Alien&quot;, and the second film in the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise. Set in the far future, it stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship. When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first encountered the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn are featured in supporting roles.

Despite the success of &quot;Alien&quot;, its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from 20th Century Fox, and repeated management changes. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for &quot;Aliens&quot; in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) and &quot;&quot; (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5million budget, &quot;Aliens&quot; began principal photography in September 1985 and concluded in January 1986. The film&#x27;s development was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios. The difficult shoot affected the composer, James Horner, who was given little time to record the music.

&quot;Aliens&quot; was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver&#x27;s performance garnered consistent praise along with those of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein. The film received several awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Weaver at a time when the science-fiction genre was generally overlooked. It earned $131.1–183.3million during its theatrical run, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1986 worldwide.

&quot;Aliens&quot; is now considered among the greatest films of the 1980s, and among the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made, arguably equal to or better than &quot;Alien&quot;. It is credited with expanding the franchise&#x27;s scope with additions to the series&#x27; backstory and factions such as the Colonial Marines. It inspired a variety of merchandise, including video games, comic books and toys. It was followed by two sequels: &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992) and &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997) and a prequel film, &quot;&quot; (2024).

==Plot==

Ellen Ripley has been in stasis for 57 years aboard a shuttlecraft after destroying her spaceship, the &quot;Nostromo&quot;, to escape an alien creature that slaughtered her crew. Ripley is rescued and debriefed by her Weyland-Yutani Corporation employers who doubt her claim about alien eggs in a derelict ship on the exomoon LV-426, now the site of a terraforming colony.

After contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate. Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on condition that they exterminate the creatures. Ripley meets the Colonial Marines aboard the spaceship &quot;Sulaco&quot; but distrusts their android, Bishop, because the &quot;Nostromo&quot;″s android, Ash, had betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders.

A dropship lands the crew on LV-426, where they find the battle-ravaged colony and two live alien facehuggers in containment tanks. The only colonist found is a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt. The team locates the other colonists&#x27; signals beneath the fusion-powered atmosphere processing station and heads to their location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions. At the station&#x27;s center, the marines discover opened eggs, dead facehuggers, and cocooned colonists serving as incubators for the alien embryos. The marines kill a newborn alien after it bursts through a colonist&#x27;s chest, rousing several adult aliens who ambush the marines, killing or capturing many. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command and rams their armored personnel carrier into the nest to rescue Corporal Dwayne Hicks, and Privates Hudson and Vasquez. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots, causing the dropship to crash into the station. Low on ammunition and resources, the survivors barricade themselves inside the colony facility.

Ripley discovers that Burke ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship containing the alien eggs, intending to profit by recovering them for biological weapon research. Before she can expose Burke, Bishop reports that the dropship crash damaged the power plant&#x27;s cooling system, and it will soon overheat and explode, destroying the colony. Bishop volunteers to travel to the colony transmitter and remotely pilot the remaining dropship to the surface.

Asleep in the medical lab, Ripley and Newt awaken to find themselves trapped with the two released facehuggers. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. She accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers to implant her and Newt with alien embryos to smuggle them through Earth&#x27;s quarantine. The power is suddenly cut, and aliens attack through the ceiling. In the ensuing firefight, the aliens kill Burke, subdue Hudson, and injure Hicks; the cornered Gorman and Vasquez sacrifice themselves to avoid capture. Newt is separated from Ripley and taken by the creatures. Ripley takes Hicks to the dropship but refuses to abandon Newt and arms herself before descending into the processing station hive alone to rescue her. During their escape, they encounter the alien queen amid dozens of eggs. When one opens, Ripley burns the eggs and blows up the queen&#x27;s ovipositor. Pursued by the enraged queen, Ripley and Newt reach the dropship and escape with Bishop and an unconscious Hicks moments before the station explodes, consuming the colony in a nuclear blast.

Aboard the &quot;Sulaco&quot;, the queen, stowed away in the dropship&#x27;s landing gear, attacks the group. The queen rips Bishop in half and advances on Newt, but Ripley battles the creature using an exosuit cargo loader, expelling it into space through an airlock while the damaged Bishop shields Newt. Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop then enter hypersleep for their return trip to Earth.

==Production==
===Early development===
The success of &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) led to immediate discussions of a sequel, but the production company Brandywine Productions struggled to convince 20th Century Fox to make it. Studio president Alan Ladd Jr. was supportive of the project but left Fox to found the Ladd Company, and his replacement, Norman Levy, was concerned about the cost of producing an &quot;AlienII&quot;. Brandywine co-founder David Giler said Levy believed a sequel would be a &quot;disaster&quot;. Fox executives believed &quot;Alien&quot;″s success was a fluke, and that it had not generated enough profit or audience interest to warrant a sequel. Box-office returns for horror films were also declining. Progress was further slowed when Giler and Brandywine co-founders Walter Hill and Gordon Carroll sued Fox for unpaid profits from &quot;Alien&quot;. Using Hollywood accounting methods, Fox had declared &quot;Alien&quot; a financial loss despite its earnings of over $100million against a $9–$11million budget. Brandywine&#x27;s lawsuit was settled by early 1983, the result being that Fox would finance the development of &quot;AlienII&quot;, but was not required to distribute the film.

Levy&#x27;s eventual replacement, Joe Wizan, was receptive to a sequel, and although other executives remained noncommittal, Giler&#x27;s development executive, Larry Wilson, began looking for a scriptwriter by mid-1983. Wilson came across the script for the in-development science fiction film, &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), written by James Cameron. With Cameron&#x27;s collaborative scriptwriting efforts alongside Sylvester Stallone on &quot;&quot; (1985), Wilson was convinced to show the script for &quot;The Terminator&quot; to Giler, Hill, and Carroll. In November 1983, Cameron submitted a 42-page film treatment for &quot;AlienII&quot;—written in three days—based on Giler and Hill&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;Ripley and soldiers&quot;. The studio had a mixed reaction, one executive calling it a constant stream of horror without character development. Negotiations to sell the sequel rights to &quot;Rambo&quot; developers Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna failed and the project stalled again.

===Revival===

By July 1984, Lawrence Gordon had replaced Wizan. With few projects in development, Gordon looked at sequels to Fox&#x27;s existing properties and came across the &quot;AlienII&quot; treatment; he said he was surprised that no one had pursued it. Production of &quot;The Terminator&quot; was delayed for nine months because Arnold Schwarzenegger was contractually obligated to film &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984). Cameron used the time to develop his treatment, expanding it to ninety pages. He drew ideas from &quot;Mother&quot;, one of his story concepts about an alien on a space station involving a power-loader suit. Because of his low expectations for &quot;The Terminator&quot;, Cameron had spent much of his free time during its production developing and trying out ideas for &quot;AlienII&quot;.

This script was better received by Fox executives and Gordon, but Cameron also wanted to direct the project. Cameron was a relatively new director, his only directing credit being &quot;Piranha II: The Spawning&quot; (1982), a low-budget, independent horror film, and the studio was reluctant to grant his request. His credibility was elevated following the surprise financial and critical success of &quot;The Terminator&quot; in late 1984, and Gordon gave him the job. Cameron&#x27;s associates tried to persuade him to reject the offer, believing anything good about the film would be attributed to &quot;Alien&quot; director Ridley Scott and anything negative to Cameron. Scott said he was never offered the chance to direct the sequel, possibly because he was difficult to work with on the original. The title &quot;Aliens&quot; reportedly came from Cameron writing &quot;Alien&quot; on a whiteboard during a pitch meeting and adding a &quot;$&quot; suffix. Cameron also wanted his collaborative partner and girlfriend, Gale Anne Hurd, to serve as the producer, but Fox did not take the request seriously, believing she could not stand up to Cameron, who believed she was the only person who would. Hurd had several industry associates contact Fox executives to convince them she was a legitimate producer.

Cameron turned in the finished script in February 1985, hours before a Hollywood writer&#x27;s strike. Cameron recalled the audience reactions while seeing &quot;Alien&quot; in the theater and believed it would be difficult to recreate the emotion and novelty of the original. He and Hurd agreed to combine the horror of &quot;Alien&quot; with the action of &quot;The Terminator&quot;. According to Hill, Cameron said if the first film could be compared to a haunted attraction, &quot;Aliens&quot; should be like a roller coaster. Cameron believed in having a strong female heroine to distinguish his films from typical Hollywood action fare and wrote the script with a picture of Weaver on his desk. He referred to &quot;The Terminator&quot;, and how he removed the normal protective forces from Sarah Connor so she had to fend for herself. Cameron had also always wanted to make a film about space infantry.

The final script was well received, but Fox executives (including chairman Barry Diller) were concerned about the budget. Fox estimated the cost as close to $35million, but Hurd said it would be closer to $15.5million. Diller offered $12million, prompting Cameron and Hurd to quit. Gordon negotiated with Diller until he relented, and Cameron and Hurd returned. In April 1985, conflict turned to the cast; Fox did not want Weaver to return because they expected her to demand a high salary. Cameron and Hurd were insistent Weaver return as the solo star; Fox refused, saying they would damage the studio&#x27;s negotiating power with Weaver&#x27;s agent. Cameron and Hurd again left the project, marrying and going on a honeymoon. When they returned, the &quot;Aliens&quot; project was ready to move forward. Cameron credited Gordon with &quot;Aliens&quot;″ being greenlit.

===Casting===
Weaver rejected initial offers to return and despite being interested after reading Cameron&#x27;s script, she had to be convinced &quot;Aliens&quot; was not being made exclusively for financial reasons. Weaver received a $1million (equivalent to $ in ) salary and a percentage of the box-office profits, the highest salary of her career at the time. Negotiations were so lengthy that Cameron and Hurd told Schwarzenegger&#x27;s agent they intended to write Ripley out of the movie (knowing Weaver&#x27;s agent would be told); terms were reached shortly afterward.

Cameron wanted an unknown actor to portray Newt. Agents scouted Henn while she was at school in Lakenheath, England, and though she lacked acting experience, Cameron said she had a &quot;great face and expressive eyes&quot;. Stephen Lang auditioned for the role of Hicks, but James Remar secured the role on the recommendation of Hill, his close friend. Remar left shortly into filming, ostensibly due to urgent family matters or creative differences with Cameron, but he later admitted he was fired after being arrested for drug possession. Hurd hired Michael Biehn the following Friday. Paxton credited his casting as Hudson to a chance encounter with Cameron at Los Angeles International Airport, during which he mentioned he would be interested in a role. Fox supported Paxton&#x27;s casting because of positive feedback for his performance in &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985). Paxton was worried the character would annoy audiences until he realized he was comic relief for the tense scenes. Henriksen was concerned about portraying Bishop after other recent successful portrayals of android characters, such as Ian Holm in &quot;Alien&quot; and Rutger Hauer in &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982). He played Bishop as an innocent child who pities the short-lived humans. He suggested wearing distinctive contact lenses to convey when Bishop was alerted to danger, but Cameron believed they would make the character appear more frightening than the aliens. Biehn, Paxton, and Henriksen had worked with Cameron on &quot;The Terminator&quot;.

&quot;Aliens&quot; was Reiser&#x27;s first major theatrical role, following small parts in films like &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984). The Colonial Marines cast features a mix of British and American actors who underwent three weeks of intensive training with the British Special Air Service (SAS). Vietnam War veteran Al Matthews (Apone) helped to train the actors, teaching them how to handle firearms properly because their blanks were still hazardous. Before he left, Remar accidentally shot a hole through the set of Frank Oz&#x27;s &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; on an adjacent stage. The training was intended to help the marine cast develop camaraderie and treat the other actors (Weaver, Reiser, and Hope) as outsiders. Biehn&#x27;s late casting caused him to miss the training, and he said he regretted being unable to customize his armor like the other actors (since he inherited Remar&#x27;s). Cameron created a distinct backstory for each marine and instructed the actors to read &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; so they would understand the space marine archetype.

Vasquez was Goldstein&#x27;s first feature-film role. She credited her physique to spending hours at the gym while unemployed, gaining at Cameron&#x27;s request. Goldstein wore dark contact lenses and underwent an hour of makeup to cover her freckles and darken her white skin to portray a &quot;Chicano&quot; character; she studied Mexican-American gang interviews to develop her demeanor and accent. Ricco Ross (Frost) was committed to &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987), whose filming schedule overlapped for a week with &quot;Aliens&quot;″. Although Cameron offered to let Ross join the filming later, Ross was concerned that Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s projects often overran, and opted for &quot;Aliens&quot; instead. Rolston misled the filmmakers to get his part; he had finished filming &quot;Revolution&quot; (1985), and implied he was its most prominent actor after Al Pacino. William Hope (Gorman) was cast as Hudson before Cameron and Hurd decided to take the character in a different direction.

Cynthia Dale Scott (Dietrich) was an aspiring singer when she was cast. Colette Hiller (Ferro) was upset she had to cut her hair short for the role because she was getting married shortly afterward, and made the filmmakers buy her a long, blonde wig. Trevor Steedman (Wierzbowski) was a stuntman rather than an actor, and &quot;Aliens&quot; was Daniel Kash&#x27;s (Spunkmeyer) debut film role. He offered Cameron his coat if he got the part and also auditioned for Hudson. The actors stayed at the Holiday Inn in Langley, Berkshire, during filming. Paxton described the actors&#x27; time outside work positively: &quot;God, we had the best time... We all hung very hard together. That&#x27;s where I first met [Henriksen], who I fell in love with. [Matthews]... was a really good spirit to have around, with a great voice. And all these hilarious British characters, like [Steedman], the stuntman, who used to grab my bicep and go, &#x27;Blimey, more meat on a cat&#x27;s cock!

===Filming===
Principal photography began in September 1985, on a 75-day schedule, and an $18.5million budget, not including film prints and marketing. Filming took place mainly at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire near London, because of its large sets and the lower cost of filming in England. Filming was difficult as Cameron, a Canadian, had little familiarity with British film-industry traditions such as tea breaks, which interrupted production for up to an hour each weekday, and was frustrated at losing hours of filming every week. In his book &quot;The Making of Aliens&quot;, J. W. Rinzler described Cameron as aggressive and certain of what he wanted, which irked the crew. The situation was exacerbated by Cameron&#x27;s hands-on approach, often modifying setups such as lighting himself to fit his vision without involving the unionized crew.

The crew was dismissive of Cameron for his relative inexperience, thinking he had not done enough to earn such a prominent position, and that Hurd had her job only because she was his partner. Cinematographer Dick Bush insisted on lighting the alien hive brightly (counter to Cameron&#x27;s request), and was eventually replaced with Adrian Biddle. First assistant director Derek Cracknell also ignored Cameron&#x27;s requests. Gale described the situation: &quot;[Cameron] would ask him to set up a shot one way and [Cracknell] would say, &#x27;Oh no no no, I know what you want,&#x27;... Then he&#x27;d do it wrong and the whole set would have to be broken down.&quot; The situation deteriorated until Cameron and Hurd fired Cracknell and the Pinewood crew walked out in the middle of the day.

Cameron called Fox for advice and was determined to move the production out of England until Hurd convinced him otherwise. The situation was tumultuous because the number of films simultaneously in production meant the crew could not be easily replaced. Cameron and Hurd gathered the crew to discuss their grievances; Cameron explained the importance of the production, and that any member of the crew who could not support it should volunteer to be replaced. The crew agreed to support Cameron if he supported their scheduled working hours. The relationship between filmmakers and crew remained cool; when filming concluded at Pinewood, Cameron told the crew: &quot;This has been a long and difficult shoot, fraught by many problems... but the one thing that kept me going, through it all, was the certain knowledge that one day I would drive out the gate of Pinewood and never come back, and that you sorry bastards would still be here&quot;. He described most of the crew as &quot;lazy, insolent, and arrogant&quot;. Paxton called the crew&#x27;s work impeccable, but their attitude more relaxed than the American crews to which he was accustomed.

The power plant and alien nest were filmed in the decommissioned Acton Lane Power Station in London, and the sets were left in place until Tim Burton redressed the sets into interiors for Axis Chemicals during the filming of his 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;. While filming the dropship descent from the &quot;Sulaco&quot;, shaking collapsed the set roof onto the cast and crew. Most of the cast were unharmed, but a large piece of debris hit Cameron in the head. Because of the tight budget, Hurd made Cameron pay for an early scene of a laser cutting Ripley free from her hypersleep chamber. According to Henriksen, Paxton was unaware he would be involved in the knife-trick scene until it was filmed; Henriksen nicked Paxton&#x27;s finger during the reshoot. Some of the early establishing scenes were filmed near the end of principal photography to capture the bond that had developed between cast and characters.

Some improvisation was encouraged. Weaver discussed tweaks to her character with Cameron on set, believing she understood how Ripley would act. Her line &quot;Get away from her, you bitch!&quot; had to be filmed in one take due to the tight schedule remaining, and the actress thought she had messed it up. Paxton believed he was not good at improvisation and discussed ideas with Cameron before filming. Hudson&#x27;s signature line &quot;Game over, man; game over!&quot; originated from Paxton developing a backstory for the character, in which he was trained on simulators. Henn found it hard to act afraid of the aliens (since she was fond of the actors in the suits) and imagined a dog was chasing her. Other cast members spent time with Henn between scenes, including Weaver and Paxton (who would color or craft things with her). Biehn said he and Paxton spent much of their free time together. Despite the difficulties, Fox was satisfied with the daily footage, and principal photography concluded in January 1986, on time and on budget.

===Post-production===
Post-production began in late April 1986. Several scenes were removed from &quot;Aliens&quot;″ theatrical release, including Ripley learning about her daughter&#x27;s death and a cocooned Burke begging her for death. Fox and Hurd suggested removing a long opening scene detailing the lives of the colonists, Newt&#x27;s family discovering the derelict alien ship, and her father being attacked by a facehugger, because it ruined the pacing and sense of mystery. Two scenes with James Remar as Hicks (shown from the back) were used in the film.

Ray Lovejoy was responsible for editing the final 137-minute cut of &quot;Aliens&quot;. Fox wanted the film to be under two hours so it could be shown more times per day in theaters, increasing its revenue potential. Fox production president Scott Rudin flew to England to ask Cameron and Hurd if they could cut another 12 minutes, but Cameron was concerned further cuts would make it nonsensical, and Rudin relented.

===Music===
James Horner met Cameron early in their careers, when they worked for director Roger Corman. &quot;Aliens&quot; was Horner and Cameron&#x27;s first collaboration; Horner called it a &quot;nightmare&quot;. He arrived in London to compose, expecting a six-week schedule. There was nothing for him to score, as Cameron was still filming and editing, and Horner had only three weeks to compose. The producers were unwilling to give him any more time, and he was booked to begin scoring &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986) shortly afterwards.

Horner recorded the score at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra. His schedule was so tight that the music for the climactic battle between Ripley and the queen was written overnight. Cameron first heard the score while it was being recorded by the orchestra and did not like it, but it was too late to make changes. Brad Fiedel&#x27;s synth-inspired tracks for &quot;The Terminator&quot; had allowed changes to be made quickly based on feedback, but Cameron had no experience managing orchestral music. Cameron cut the score up, using pieces where he believed they fit best, and inserted pieces of Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;Alien&quot; score and hired unknown composers to fill gaps. The director said in a later interview he thought the music was good, but did not fit the scenes he had filmed. Horner&#x27;s &quot;alien sting&quot; sound was initially used only once, during the scene with the cocooned woman, as Cameron disliked it, but he eventually used it throughout the film. Unused portions of Horner&#x27;s &quot;Aliens&quot; score were repurposed for &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988).
==Special effects and design==
Development of the special effects for &quot;Aliens&quot; began in May 1985, with John Richardson supervising a 40-person team at Stan Winston Studio. L.A. Effects Group created miniatures and optical effects. Cameron lacked contacts at the more established special effects studios and avoided using them because he believed his hands-on approach would not be welcomed. He also did not rehire many &quot;Alien&quot; crew members because he did not want to be restricted by their loyalties to the first film. Those who returned were often given a higher status (such as Crispian Sallis, &quot;Alien&quot; focus puller and &quot;Aliens&quot; set decorator). Cameron had enjoyed returning artist Ron Cobb&#x27;s work on &quot;Alien&quot;, and conceptual artist Syd Mead was recruited because Cameron was a fan of his work on films such as &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; (1984).

===Sets and technology===
Mead designed the &quot;Sulaco&quot;, the marines&#x27; spaceship. He conceived it as a large sphere with antennae, but Cameron wanted it to be flatter; the full craft had to pass the camera, and a sphere would not work with the aspect ratio. Mead designed the craft as a commercial freighter carrying a military unit. Its exterior was designed with a row of loading doors, a crane, and large gun fixtures to defend against threats. Mirrors were used as a cost-cutting measure to increase the number of sleeping pods and add a power loader. Cobb designed the dropship, the armored personnel carrier (APC), and exteriors of the colony and its vehicles. The &quot;Sulaco&quot;″s dropship was designed to be life-size, for use on the &quot;Sulaco&quot; set, but a smaller replica was used for some shots. The APC was a disguised pushback tug for a Boeing 747. The derelict alien spacecraft used in &quot;Aliens&quot; had been in historian Bob Burns III&#x27;s driveway since its appearance in &quot;Alien&quot;.

Most of the colony, apart from the main entrance used by the marines, was constructed in scale miniature form. The set was about long to accommodate the sixth-scale APC replica. The set was so large it had to be laid out diagonally across the stage, and forced perspective was used to add in buildings that would otherwise not fit. Cobb used a stylized design for the colony, resembling a western frontier town. It featured a makeshift construction from cargo containers, broken filming equipment, and beer crates. The alien nest scene was one of the earliest filmed; Weaver&#x27;s participation was delayed by three weeks because of production issues on her previous film &quot;Half Moon Street&quot; (1986), and the scene was one of the few not involving her. The Acton Power Station location was filled with decaying asbestos and three weeks were spent having it professionally cleaned, during which time the alien hive was fabricated in clay spawning hundreds of fiberglass and vacuum-formed castings that were installed at the station over a further three weeks. Cameron wanted to vertically pan as the marines entered the hive, but disguising the area above the marines would be time-intensive. A hanging miniature, about square, was made from plywood and styrofoam, hung just above the actors&#x27; heads, and carefully blended into the larger set. After Remar was replaced, Cameron wanted to reshoot the scene, but the miniature had been destroyed; he was able to edit the scene to conceal Remar.

The marines&#x27; smart guns weighed , and were constructed from German MG 42 machine guns attached to a steadicam and augmented with motorcycle parts. Since getting in and out of the smart-gun rig was difficult, the actors kept them on when not filming. The pulse rifle was made from a Thompson submachine gun and a Franchi SPAS-12 pump-action shotgun in a futuristic shell. Weaver was opposed to weapons in general, but Cameron explained weapons were secondary to the core narrative of Ripley bonding with and protecting Newt. Weaver found using the weapons strange and difficult, due to their weight and her concern about pulling the wrong trigger. Automated sentry guns were also constructed for &quot;Aliens&quot;, although they do not appear in the theatrical cut. Real machine guns were positioned atop remote-controlled hydraulic tripods that allowed them to pivot horizontally or vertically. The guns were capable of firing up to 600 wooden-blank rounds per minute that were shattered into small splinters by baffles in the muzzle and incinerated by the heat generated in the barrel.

A cast was made of Henn&#x27;s upper body and her stunt double&#x27;s legs to construct a lightweight dummy for Weaver to hold when carrying a gun; Henn&#x27;s weight plus a gun would have been too heavy. Goldstein had never handled a gun, and held her weapon incorrectly in closeups, so Hurd stood in for her. The flamethrowers were functional. The art department had covered the sets in an unspecified substance to artificially age them; the flamethrowers vaporized it, causing fire and heavy smoke. Goldstein struggled to breathe and, since improvisation was encouraged, Paxton thought she was acting until he also became breathless.

The nuclear explosion of the colony in the finale was created by shining a light bulb through cotton. Reebok designer Taun Le was commissioned to design custom sneakers for Weaver to wear in the film. The only mandate was that they be laceless so one could easily slide off of Weaver&#x27;s foot during the finale.
===Creature effects===

H. R. Giger, who designed the alien creature, was reportedly disappointed that he could not be involved in &quot;Aliens&quot;. According to Hurd, Giger was contractually obligated to &quot;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&quot; (1986) and Fox was not allowed to negotiate with him. Giger was replaced by special-effects creator Stan Winston. Cameron also contributed to designs but was not as concerned with the warrior aliens because they were on screen only briefly. In redesigning the alien warriors, Cameron remained faithful to Giger&#x27;s work while building on it. Conscious that the creatures would be seen by audiences as people in costumes, he enhanced the designs by extending their arms and often filmed them hung from wires or from atypical positions to make them appear more inhuman. The aliens were played by dancers and stuntmen in lightweight costumes that allowed them to move quickly. Several mannequins were used for aliens that were contorted into inhuman poses. Although hordes of alien creatures appear to be in the film, there were only 12 alien suits: simple black leotards covered in molded foam were used for faster-moving shots, and detailed models with articulated upper bodies and mouths for closeups. When the aliens were shot and destroyed, puppets were hung up and detonated. The aliens&#x27; acidic blood was a combination of titanium tetrachloride, cyclohexylamine, acetic acid and yellow dye.

The facehugger design remained faithful to the original &quot;Alien&quot; design, but the overall appearance was made to appear more organic, and its eight legs were made more finger-like, enhancing the detail on the knuckles and adding fingernails. Unlike in &quot;Alien&quot;, which only involved one substantial jumping scene, the facehugger models used in &quot;Aliens&quot; featured full articulation for their tongue, legs, and tail, allowing for more action set pieces. The tail was also lengthened about to give it more functions such as a whip-like action. Nine operators were required for the fully articulated facehugger; other less-detailed variants were used for simple actions such as scurrying across the floor. The design team struggled with making it scuttle believably while moving the appendages; they eventually developing a control wire along the floor that activated a gear inside it, causing the appendages to move as it was pulled along. Several rubber facehuggers were made to be thrown or blown up. Manipulating the facehugger inside a water tank was also difficult as the tank had to be watertight, limiting the use of control cables. A method was developed that required fewer cables to move the facehugger around the tank; the tail was fitted with a spring that caused it to snap back and forth. Winston added arms to the chestburster alien form (since the adult form had arms), explaining how it could drag itself out of a host&#x27;s chest. Two chestburster puppets were used: a reinforced one, and an articulated one for movement. A puppeteer punched the former through a fabricated latex-foam chest; the scene took several takes to film because it could not pierce the clothing.

A deleted scene in &quot;Alien&quot; established a life cycle for the alien creatures in which a lifeform would be cocooned and transformed into an egg that birthed a facehugger. Inspired by a beehive-like hierarchy, Cameron believed the vast field of eggs on the derelict alien craft would come from a much larger creature, the queen, with the other alien creatures serving as her drones. Winston described Cameron&#x27;s initial queen design as a combination of a praying mantis and &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; influenced by the alien warrior design. Cameron said dinosaur influences were unintentional as he considered them &quot;boring&quot;; his goal was to extrapolate on Giger&#x27;s warrior designs to create a large and powerful creature that was also swift and overtly female, describing it as &quot;hideous and beautiful at the same time, like a black widow spider&quot;. The queen has elongated, large forelimbs, with smaller secondary ones underneath, but Winston redesigned the legs by adding a double joint to make it more inhuman. Cameron and Winston worked on several concepts to vivify the queen, including large puppets, miniatures, and costumes with several people inside. A frame was built large enough to hold two people, covered in black polythene bags, and hung on a crane. The prototype was a success, and Cameron wrote the alien-queen scene. The final alien queen was a puppet made of lightweight polyurethane foam. Two people sat inside to control the arms; the legs were controlled by rods connected at the ankles, and a separate person whipped the tail around with fishing line. The head was manipulated with a combination of servomotors and hydraulics controlled by up to four people. The effect was hidden by lighting, steam, slime, and smoke. The Stan Winston Studio had not used hydraulics and considered them a learning experience. They were essential for moving larger parts of the queen puppet, including the head, and a foot pedal in the body could hydraulically move the tail up and down. Shane Mahan took several weeks to sculpt the head by sight, based on a maquette; computer technology to scale up the model&#x27;s design did not yet exist. Two heads were built: a lightweight, fragile one; and another that could survive some damage. Each was articulated with hydraulics and cables to control the queen&#x27;s mouth and lips.

To create the effect of the queen piercing Bishop&#x27;s chest with her tail, Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis constructed a chestplate for Henriksen with a rubber segment of the queen&#x27;s tail flattened against it. The tail was pulled forward by wire, apparently exploding through Bishop&#x27;s torso. A rigid piece of tail, attached to a body harness, was used to show more of the tail moving through Bishop, and Henriksen was levered upward as if he was being lifted by the tail. To complete the effect, a dummy of Bishop was constructed with a spring-loaded mechanism that forcibly separated his upper and lower body, as if the queen had ripped him in half. Once separated, Henriksen&#x27;s upper body was below the set and a fake torso attached up to his shoulders. The android blood was milk, and after several days of filming, it was sour and foul-smelling.

John Richardson designed the mechanical power loader exosuit, with input from Mead. As with the queen, a prototype was built out of wood and polythene bags stuffed with newspaper to see how the movement would work. The finished design was so cumbersome that stuntman John Lees, in a black skinsuit, operated it from behind. The battle between the queen and power loader was extensively choreographed, as Weaver risked serious injury battling a large, unwieldy animatronic. The camera was sometimes moved to simulate subjects moving faster. The scene of the queen running at Ripley was one of the more difficult shots; the wires and rods had to be concealed, since they could not be removed in post-production. Miniatures were used for parts of the scene with go motion, a version of stop motion with motion blur added.

==Release==
===Context===
The 1986 summer film season began in mid-May. The season had been starting earlier each year as studios attempted to beat each other with their biggest films. Fifty-five films were scheduled for release between May and September, including the action drama &quot;Top Gun&quot; and the comedic &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot;, but the season was not expected to break financial records due to fewer sequels, anticipated blockbusters, and films by Steven Spielberg or starring popular comedians that had dominated the earlier half of the decade. Some industry experts also blamed the burgeoning home-video market, which had grown from 7million rentals in 1983 to 58million by 1985. Films expected to do well were aimed at younger audiences and featured comedy or horror, such as &quot;Back to School&quot;, &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, and &quot;SpaceCamp&quot;. Some films targeted at adults were also seen as potential successes, including &quot;Legal Eagles&quot;, &quot;Ruthless People&quot;, and &quot;Cobra&quot;.

&quot;Aliens&quot; was seen by industry professionals as a potential sleeper hit based on positive industry word-of-mouth during filming, enthusiastic industry screenings, and favorable pre-release reviews. The film&#x27;s success was considered dependent on its ability to attract audiences outside the young males and blue-collar workers typical for the genre. The tagline was, &quot;This time, it&#x27;s war&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Aliens&quot; began a wide release in the United States (U.S.) and Canada on July18, 1986. During its opening weekend, the film earned $10.1million from 1,437 theaters—an average of $6,995 per theater. It was the weekend&#x27;s number-one film, ahead of the martial-arts drama &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; ($5.6million in its fifth weekend) and the black comedy &quot;Ruthless People&quot; ($4.5million in its fourth weekend). Based on its opening-five-day total ($13.4million), &quot;Aliens&quot; exceeded Fox&#x27;s expectations and was anticipated to become the summer&#x27;s top film, surpassing &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;, &quot;Back to School&quot;, and &quot;Top Gun&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported long lines to see &quot;Aliens&quot;, even on weekday afternoons.

The film retained the number-one position in its second weekend with an additional gross of $8.6million, ahead of the debuting &quot;Heartburn&quot; ($5.8million) and &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; ($5million). &quot;Aliens&quot; remained the number-one film of its third weekend with a gross of $7.1million, ahead of the debuts of &quot;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&quot; ($6.8million) and the &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; ($5.1million). The film fell to third place in its fifth weekend with a gross of $4.30million, behind the debuts of &quot;The Fly&quot; ($7million) and &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; ($4.33million). &quot;Aliens&quot; was one of the top ten highest-grossing films for 11 weeks.

By the end of its theatrical run, &quot;Aliens&quot; had grossed about $85.1million. This figure made it the year&#x27;s seventh highest-grossing film, behind &quot;Back to School&quot; ($91.3million), science-fiction film &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; ($109.6million), &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; ($115.1million), war film &quot;Platoon&quot; (138.5million), action comedy &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; ($174.8million) and &quot;Top Gun&quot; ($176.8million). &quot;Aliens&quot;″ box-office returns to the studio, minus the theaters&#x27; share, was $42.5million.

Box office figures outside the U.S. and Canada are inconsistent and not available for all 1986 films. According to the box-office tracking websites Box Office Mojo and the Numbers, &quot;Aliens&quot; earned from $45.9million to $98.1million. This gives &quot;Aliens&quot; a worldwide gross of $131.1million to $183.3million, making it the year&#x27;s fourth-highest-grossing film, behind &quot;Platoon&quot; ($138million), &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; ($328.2million), and &quot;Top Gun&quot; ($356.8million), or the third-highest-grossing film behind &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; and &quot;Top Gun&quot;. According to Fox&#x27;s 1992 estimate, &quot;Aliens&quot; had earned $157million worldwide. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;extremely successful.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Aliens&quot; opened to generally positive reviews. It appeared on the cover of the July 28, 1986, edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which called it &quot;The Summer&#x27;s Scariest Movie&quot;. Audience polls by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an scale.

Most reviewers agreed &quot;Aliens&quot; was a worthy successor to &quot;Alien&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; and Walter Goodman said it could not replicate the novelty of the first film, but &quot;Aliens&quot; compensated with special effects, technique, and a constant stream of set-piece thrills and scary scenes. &quot;Variety&quot; added &quot;Aliens&quot; was made by an expert craftsman, suggesting its predecessor was a more artistic endeavor. Sheila Benson said &quot;Aliens&quot; was clever and ironically funny, but lacked &quot;Alien&quot; pure horror. Benson attributed this to an overabundance of creature effects in the intervening years, particularly the 1982 film &quot;The Thing&quot; (which, Benson said, took alien monstrosities to an extreme).

According to Rick Kogan, &quot;Aliens&quot; demonstrated that science-fiction horror could still be entertaining after many poorly received &quot;Alien&quot;-derived films. Dave Kehr and Richard Schickel called it a rare sequel which surpassed the original, and Kehr appreciated the action used to develop the characters. Schickel wrote that the film had evolved from &quot;Alien&quot;, giving Weaver new emotional depths. Jay Scott said Cameron had redefined the war film, combining &quot;Rambo&quot; with &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Kogan agreed Cameron possessed a knack for action pacing and excitement, but Kehr believed Cameron pushed some elements beyond believability.

Roger Ebert called the last hour &quot;painfully, unremittingly intense&quot; in horror and action, leaving him emotionally drained and unhappy. Ebert believed it could not be defined as entertainment, despite his admiration of the filmmaking craft on display. Dennis Fischer wrote for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that the unrelenting scenes of action and suspense worked for &quot;Aliens&quot; as they had in &quot;The Terminator&quot;; tension was created by placing the characters in successive, increasingly difficult situations. Gene Siskel described the film as &quot;one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses&quot;. In the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, Jay Boyar called it the &quot;Jaws&quot; of the 1980s: the most &quot;intensely shocking&quot; film in years.

Reviewers consistently praised Weaver&#x27;s performance. Benson called her the &quot;white-hot core&quot; around whose &quot;defiant intelligence&quot; and &quot;sensual athleticism&quot; &quot;Aliens&quot; was built, and Ripley returned not for vengeance but out of compassion. Ebert credited Weaver&#x27;s sympathetic performance with holding &quot;Aliens&quot; together. Kogan compared her to a more attractive John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s action character). Scott agreed, saying Weaver made action stars like Stallone and Schwarzenegger look like male pin-up models. He described her as the ultimate adventure heroine, balancing action with femininity and maternal instincts. Pauline Kael was critical of the film overall as too &quot;mechanical&quot;, but praised Weaver&#x27;s physical presence and performance, writing that, without her, &quot;Aliens&quot; was a subpar B picture.

Most of the cast was also praised, particularly Biehn, Goldstein, Henriksen, Henn and Reiser but Benson noted that less time was spent exploring the new characters than in &quot;Alien&quot;. Schickel said Henn played her character as endearingly brave and clever, without self-pity. Benson praised Horner&#x27;s &quot;ruminative, intelligent&quot; music, but Fischer criticized it for borrowing too much from Goldsmith&#x27;s score and Horner&#x27;s work on &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984).

===Accolades===

&quot;Aliens&quot; received two awards at the 1987 Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing (Don Sharpe) and Best Visual Effects (Robert Skotak, Stan Winston, John Richardson, Suzanne Benson). Weaver was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Marlee Matlin for the romantic drama &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot;. Weaver&#x27;s was the first Best Actress nomination given for a science-fiction film, at a time when the genre was given little respect, and it remained a rarity for the action or science-fiction genres. The film garnered four other nominations: Best Original Score for Horner; Best Art Director for Peter Lamont and Crispian Sallis; Best Editing for Ray Lovejoy, and Best Sound for Graham V. Hartstone, Nicolas Le Messurier, Michael A. Carter, and Roy Charman. At the 44th Golden Globe Awards, Weaver was nominated for Best Actress in a Drama.

At the 40th British Academy Film Awards, &quot;Aliens&quot; won the award for Best Special Visual Effects and three other nominations: Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hair for Peter Robb King, and Best Sound. At the 14th Saturn Awards, &quot;Aliens&quot; received eight awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actress (Weaver), Best Performance by a Young Actor (Henn), Best Supporting Actress (Goldstein), Best Supporting Actor (Paxton), Best Special Effects (Winston and the L.A. Effects Group) and Best Director and Best Writing (both for Cameron). It received a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

==Post-release==
===Home media===

&quot;Aliens&quot; was released on VHS in February 1987. A modified cut, including scenes deleted from the theatrical release, was broadcast on CBS in 1989, and a further extended edition with more deleted scenes, including the opening scene of Newt&#x27;s family investigating the derelict spacecraft, was released on LaserDisc in 1991. The extended cut is 157minutes long, 20 minutes longer than the theatrical cut, and Cameron has stated it is his preferred version.

The extended edition was released on VHS and DVD in 1999 as part of the &quot;Alien Legacy&quot; box set with the other three available &quot;Alien&quot; films: &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992) and &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997). The DVD version was also sold separately, and both versions included additional behind-the-scenes footage. The 2003 &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; nine-DVD box set included all four films and an additional disc for each film with behind-the-scenes footage and featurettes (including a three-hour documentary, &quot;Superior Firepower: The Making of Aliens&quot;), and theatrical and extended cuts of each film. The &quot;Aliens&quot; disc included commentary by cast and crew members, including Cameron; Weaver did not participate. Each film was sold separately (including its bonus disc) in 2004.

&quot;Aliens&quot; was released on Blu-ray in 2010 as part of the &quot;Alien Anthology&quot; box set with remastered footage, theatrical and extended versions, and featurettes found in earlier releases. The film was released separately on Blu-ray in 2011. For its 30th anniversary in 2016, &quot;Aliens&quot; was released on Blu-ray and digital download, featuring a new interview with Cameron about his inspirations for the film. In addition to the theatrical and extended versions, the release contained a limited-edition lithograph of Ripley in battle with the alien queen, an art book focused on the &quot;Aliens&quot; comic books by Dark Horse Comics, and collectible cards with concept art by Cameron. A limited-edition, 75-copy vinyl soundtrack was also released that year. A 4K Ultra HD remastered Collector&#x27;s Edition of &quot;Aliens&quot; was made available for digital release in December 2023, followed by a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release in March 2024. This release received some criticism for the use of artificial intelligence to improve the image quality, which resulted in some overly smooth and uncanny results.

===Other media===
Toy company Kenner Products attempted to release figures based on &quot;Alien&quot; in 1979, but only an alien action figure was released, which was quickly withdrawn when it was deemed too frightening for children. &quot;Aliens&quot; was considered a different prospect (despite its adult-oriented content), since it focused on action and featured marines (instead of ordinary workers) fighting a large number of aliens. The toys were intended to tie into &quot;Operation Aliens&quot; (a children&#x27;s cartoon scheduled for release in 1992, alongside &quot;Alien 3&quot;) and a series of mini-comics by Dark Horse Comics. Since its release, &quot;Aliens&quot; has appeared across a variety of merchandise, including action figures, punching bags, clothing, and board games. McFarlane Toys released figures for Hicks, the alien, and the alien queen in the early 2000s. In the late 2010s, National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released figures based on the film, including Newt, Burke, and Cameron dressed as a Colonial Marine. NECA also revived the original Kenner designs in 2019, releasing better-quality models.

&quot;Aliens&quot; has had several video-game adaptations, beginning with&quot; &quot; (1986), which was followed by a separate game, also called &quot;&quot;, in 1987. A side-scroller, &quot;Aliens&quot; (1987), was released in Japan for the MSX, and a 1990 arcade game, &quot;Aliens&quot;, allowed players to play as Ripley or Hicks against alien variants; some levels required the player to control Newt. &quot;&quot;, an adventure game focusing on puzzles, was released in 1995. A first-person shooter, &quot;Alien Trilogy&quot; (1996), is based on &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, and &quot;Alien 3&quot;. &quot;Aliens Online&quot; (1998) was an online game which allowed players to play as Colonial Marines or aliens. &quot;&quot; (2013) is a first-person shooter and a canonical sequel of &quot;Aliens&quot;, focusing on the marines sent to search for Ripley&#x27;s expedition. Several other games have the &quot;Aliens&quot; brand or are side stories or sequels to the film&#x27;s events, and the &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; game series.

A novelization by Alan Dean Foster was released alongside the film. Comic books based on (and continuing) the story of &quot;Aliens&quot; have been published (primarily by Dark Horse Comics) since 1988, including crossovers of the titular aliens with popular franchises, such as &quot;Predator&quot; (creating a derivative &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; franchise), &quot;Terminator&quot;, and &quot;Superman&quot;. Reebok&#x27;s boots designed for Ripley became available to the public in 2016; other versions included boots based on the power loader, Bishop, the Colonial Marines and the alien queen. Rinzler published &quot;The Making of Aliens&quot;, a 300-page behind-the-scenes book with cast and crew interviews and previously unseen photographs, in 2020. &quot;Operation Aliens&quot;, a board game, was released in 1992. Players are cast as a Colonial Marine or Ripley and tasked with finding a self-destruct code to destroy an infested spaceship.

==Themes==
===Motherhood===
A central theme of &quot;Aliens&quot; is motherhood. &quot;Alien&quot; can be seen as a metaphor for childbirth, but &quot;Aliens&quot; focuses on Ripley&#x27;s maternal feelings for Newt. A scene cut from the theatrical release depicts Ripley learning her child died while she was in stasis, helping explain Ripley&#x27;s motherly attention for Newt. Newt has also lost everything of value, and they form a new family from the remnants of their old ones. This relationship is mirrored by the alien queen, mother of the alien creatures. There are no paternal figures; both are single mothers, defending their young. The alien queen seeks revenge against Ripley, who destroyed her brood and her means of reproduction. According to Richard Schickel, &quot;Alien&quot; is about survival; &quot;Aliens&quot; is about fighting to ensure someone else&#x27;s survival.

Authors Tammy Ostrander and Susan Yunis believed Newt&#x27;s capture by the aliens forces Ripley to realize she is willing to die to save her, demonstrating a selfless motherhood, unlike the queen&#x27;s selfish motherhood. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Nancy Weber wrote that as a mother, she saw in &quot;Aliens&quot; the constant vigilance required to protect her child from predators, sexism, and threats to childhood innocence. Leilani Nishime believed despite the focus on motherhood, the nuclear family is represented in &quot;Aliens&quot; with a mother (Ripley), father (Hicks), daughter (Newt), and a loyal, self-sacrificing dog (Bishop).

According to Charles Berg, the depictions of aliens in science fiction that became more popular during the 1980s represented American fears of immigrants (the &quot;other&quot;). In &quot;Aliens&quot;, this can be seen in the white-skinned single mother (Ripley) confronting the dark-skinned alien queen with an endless brood. Ostrander and Yunis also identified fears of overcrowding, dwindling resources, and pollution, suggesting the alien queen demonizes motherhood and makes it less attractive. She represents mindless, unchecked maternal instinct spawning armies of children, regardless of the lives which must be sacrificed to ensure their survival. Despite imminent destruction by the colony exploding, the queen continues to reproduce. The aliens&#x27; life cycle taints the reproductive cycle. Creation involves rape, and birth involves a violent death. In destroying the aliens and their queen, Ripley rejects the unchecked proliferation of their species and sets an example for her own.

===Masculinity and femininity===

Ripley has been compared to John Rambo and dubbed Ramboette, Rambette, Fembo, Ramboline; Weaver called herself Rambolina. Mary Lee Settle said females in television and film had evolved from escapist fantasy to more accurately reflect their audiences. A gun, which can be seen as a phallic symbol, has a different meaning when wielded by Weaver. Schickel described Ripley as transcending the customary boundaries imposed on her gender, where females serve the male hero. In &quot;Aliens&quot;, the male characters are neutralized by the climax and Ripley faces the queen alone. Cameron said he does not like cowardly female characters and removes their expected protectors to force them to fend for themselves. He called the overuse of male heroes &quot;commercially shortsighted&quot; in an industry whose audience is 50-percent female, and where &quot;80 percent of the time, it&#x27;s women who decide which film to see&quot;.

The growth of female-led action films after the success of &quot;Aliens&quot; reflects the change in women&#x27;s roles and the divide between professional critics (who perceive a masculinization of the heroine) and audiences that—regardless of gender—embrace, emulate, and quote Ripley. The hyper-masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme were replaced by independent women capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991) and Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991). These female characters often perform stereotypical male actions, and have muscular physiques rather than feminine &quot;soft&quot; bodies. When Ripley has seized command of the marines and is no longer a passive outsider in &quot;Aliens&quot;, the traditional male hero (Hicks) instructs her in the use of their weapons. The comparison of Ripley to Rambo conflates her with the male, musclebound, gun-wielding action hero. To balance her masculine traits, Cameron gives Ripley maternal instincts; this counters homophobic audiences, who might see a masculinized female as lesbian or butch. These traits are further offset by the more openly masculine Vasquez, a minor character. Vasquez (who has short hair and bigger muscles) is introduced to the audience by working out, and is asked if she has ever been mistaken for a man. Weber appreciated the change in female characters between the films, contrasting &quot;Alien&quot; hysterical Lambert with the tough Vasquez (who sacrifices herself for her team, not only for the protagonist).

===War and trauma===
&quot;Aliens&quot; has been described as an allegory for the Vietnam War; the marines (like the United States) have superior weaponry and technology that proves largely ineffective against an unseen, local enemy. Like some Vietnam veterans, Ripley developed post-traumatic stress disorder after the events of &quot;Alien&quot;. Writer Joe Abbott contrasted the depiction of the military in &quot;Aliens&quot; to the 1954 science-fiction film &quot;Them!&quot; In both films, humans are beset by a monstrous invasion; in &quot;Them!&quot;, the military is the hero despite its responsibility for the infestation. Abbott said its post-World War II American setting depicts a competent military and a state authority that demands (and receives) the compliance of its citizens. The image of the post-Vietnam military is tarnished and scrutinized; in &quot;Aliens&quot;, it is ill-equipped, bumbling, and incapable of combating the threat posed by the alien creatures. Citizen cooperation can no longer be demanded or expected, and it is Ripley, an independent contractor from outside the state and military infrastructures, who saves the day. Unlike &quot;Them!&quot;, the military is not at fault for creating the problem in &quot;Aliens&quot;; it is the Weyland-Yutani corporation (&quot;the company&quot;). The power of the state has been superseded by the corporation, which also demands conformity for rewards and advancement and reflects a growing mistrust of corporatism; the company is represented by Burke, a self-interested opportunist. Ripley is elevated throughout &quot;Aliens&quot; as she prioritizes the survival and safety of all humans while Burke is often willing to callously sacrifice human life in pursuit of the interests of the company.

According to Weaver, &quot;Aliens&quot; is about confronting trauma to obtain closure. This may be seen as a reflection of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s United States presidency and a conservatism that believed the hero must return to confront their fears with ethics and morality on their side. Comparing &quot;Alien&quot; with &quot;Aliens&quot;, Roger Luckhurst said: &quot;Even if &quot;Alien&quot; was a piece of leftist science fiction, the core of [its] myth could be inflected the other way. [Cameron&#x27;s] &quot;Aliens&quot; would be a defiantly Reaganite version of the story—pumped, militarized, libertarian driven by a staunch defense of the nuclear family.&quot; Abbott said &quot;Aliens&quot; adheres to a radical ideology and condemns centrism; similar films were popular because they represented audience dissatisfaction with the social &quot;status quo&quot;. The film places power in the individual (Ripley), instead of institutions like the military, corporations, or the government. The Bishop character also allows Ripley to confront her distrust of androids that resulted from the deception of Ash (portrayed by Ian Holm) in &quot;Alien&quot;. Unlike Ash, Bishop is openly an android and conveys both a similarly unassuming personality and a fascination with the alien creatures. &quot;Aliens&quot; imbues Bishop with a degree of humanity as he volunteers for a potentially suicidal mission. Although the other characters assume he is artificial and thus unafraid, Bishop affirms, &quot;Believe me, I&#x27;d prefer not to, I may be synthetic, but I&#x27;m not stupid.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Cultural influence===

A cinematic touchstone, &quot;Aliens&quot; has had an enduring influence on filmmaking. Elements such as a team of soldiers being dismantled by a villain have been repeated to the point of cliché. The same is true of Horner&#x27;s oft-imitated score, which regularly appeared in action-film trailers for the following decade. The film&#x27;s influence can also be seen in video games&#x27; (particularly science-fiction games&#x27;) ships, armor, and weapons, as well as the 1989 Italian film &quot;Shocking Dark&quot;, a remake of &quot;Aliens&quot; that relocates much of the plot and scenes to a Venetian setting and incorporates elements of &quot;The Terminator&quot;; outside Italy, it was released as &quot;Terminator II&quot;. In &quot;&quot; (2018), Spider-Man discusses the film with Iron Man, and the two use the xenomorph queen&#x27;s defeat as inspiration for how to kill Ebony Maw and free Doctor Strange.

Although &quot;The Terminator&quot; was a success for Cameron, the critical and commercial success of &quot;Aliens&quot; made him a blockbuster director. It also expanded the &quot;Alien&quot; series into a franchise, spanning video games, comic books, and toys; although Ripley and the alien creature originated in &quot;Alien&quot;, Cameron elaborated on the creature&#x27;s life cycle, added new characters and factions (such as the Colonial Marines), and extended the films&#x27; universe. Ripley became a post-feminist icon, a proactive hero who retained feminine traits. &quot;Aliens&quot; features popular quotes, including Paxton&#x27;s &quot;Game over, man; game over&quot;, and Weaver&#x27;s &quot;Get away from her, you bitch,&quot; which is considered one of &quot;Aliens&quot; most memorable lines and has often been repeated in other media. &quot;Aliens&quot; was named by director Roland Emmerich as one of his top ten science-fiction films, alongside &quot;Alien&quot;.

Many cast and crew members reunited at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to celebrate the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, including Weaver, Biehn, Paxton, Henriksen, Reiser, Henn, Cameron and Hurd. Cameron said he normally would not participate (and did not do so for &quot;The Terminator&quot;″s anniversary) but he considered &quot;Aliens&quot; special because of its impact on his career. Asked why he thought &quot;Aliens&quot;″ popularity had endured, Cameron said:

Hurd believed that it was the experience itself:

The ensemble cast&#x27;s popularity led to many members appearing together in later films, including Henriksen, Goldstein, and Paxton in &quot;Near Dark&quot; (1987) as well as Goldstein and Rolston in &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; (1989). Biehn lost a role in Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) because Weaver had been cast, and the director did not want to create an obvious association with &quot;Aliens&quot;. Paxton is also remembered as one of only two actors, along with Lance Henriksen, to play characters killed by an alien, a Terminator (in &quot;The Terminator&quot;), and a Predator (in 1990&#x27;s &quot;Predator 2&quot;). Despite her sudden fame, Henn decided not to pursue acting, so that she could remain close to her family. She said some people resented her fame and was uncertain whether people liked her for being in &quot;Aliens&quot; or for herself. Henn became a teacher; she maintains a relationship with Weaver and kept a framed picture of her and Weaver that the actress had given her after filming was complete.

===Critical reassessment===
&quot;Aliens&quot; is considered one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made, as well as being among the best films of the 1980s, and one of the greatest action films of all time. The British Film Institute called &quot;Aliens&quot; one of the 10 greatest action films, saying: &quot;A matriarchal masterpiece of God-bothering structural engineering, there&#x27;s really little that &quot;Aliens&quot; doesn&#x27;t get right; from its slow-burn exemplification of character and world-building through to its jab-jab-hook-pause-uppercut series of sustained climaxes, Cameron delivers a masterclass in action direction.&quot;

The film is also considered one of the best sequels of all time, and equal to (or better than) &quot;Alien&quot;. According to &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, it exceeded &quot;Alien&quot; in every way. In 2009, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; called it the best blockbuster sequel ever made, and remarkable even as a standalone film. In 2017, the website ranked it the second-best film in the series (behind &quot;Alien&quot;). In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; called it the greatest movie sequel ever. &quot;Empire&quot; also listed &quot;Aliens&quot; as the 30th-best film ever made on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Movies Of All Time&quot; list; its readers ranked it the 17th-best. The film is listed in the book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Aliens&quot; has a approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from reviews, with an average rating of . Its critical consensus reads, &quot;While &quot;Alien&quot; was a marvel of slow-building, atmospheric tension, &quot;Aliens&quot; packs a much more visceral punch, and features a typically strong performance from Sigourney Weaver.&quot; The film has a score of 84 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The Ellen Ripley character has also been recognized; the American Film Institute ranked her the eighth-most-heroic character on its 2003 100 Years ... 100 Heroes and Villains list, and she was ninth on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2006 &quot;100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot; list. Despite her character&#x27;s popularity, the casting of Jenette Goldstein (a Jewish actress of Russian, Moroccan, and Brazilian descent) as the Hispanic Vasquez has been considered odd. Goldstein has said she considers herself unrecognizable as Vasquez on film, but a muscular actress was required, and the filmmakers could not find anyone else with her physique.

==Franchise==
&quot;Aliens&quot;″ success resulted in immediate discussion of a sequel. &quot;Alien 3&quot; was released in 1992, after a tumultuous development involving several writers and directors; Cameron did not return. The film was financially successful, but &quot;generally panned&quot; by critics, and its director, David Fincher, disowned it after the release, citing studio interference. The film was also derided by fans because it killed the Hicks and Newt characters off-screen. Biehn called it one of his greatest disappointments and refused permission for the use of his likeness in &quot;Alien 3&quot;. Regarding the treatment of his characters, Cameron said:

An early script for &quot;Alien 3&quot;, by William Gibson, was adapted as a 2019 audio drama, focusing on Hicks as the protagonist, with Biehn and Henriksen voicing their respective roles. A five-hour 2017 audio drama, &quot;River of Pain&quot;, takes place between &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; and covers the early days of the LV-426 colony and its downfall to the aliens. Actors returning to voice their characters included William Hope, Mac MacDonald, Stuart Milligan, and Alibe Parsons. A third sequel, &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, was released in 1997. Instead of a fourth sequel, Fox began development of a prequel crossover film, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004), pitting the series&#x27; aliens against the titular alien race of its science-fiction property, &quot;Predator&quot;; the film was poorly received. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; (2007), the least financially-successful and worst-reviewed film in either franchise.

Ridley Scott returned to the series for &quot;Prometheus&quot; (2012) (a prequel to &quot;Alien&quot;) and its sequel, &quot;&quot; (2017). A fourth &quot;Alien&quot; sequel was in development by 2020, but was canceled by the Walt Disney Company following its acquisition of 20th Century Fox. A stand-alone film in the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise, &quot;&quot;, was released on August 16, 2024; it is set between the events of &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;.

<doc id="213473" wikidata="Q1052311" url="?curid=213473" title="List of largest optical refracting telescopes">
<text>Refracting telescopes use a lens to focus light. The Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, with a lens diameter of 43 inches, is technically the largest, with 39 inches clear for the aperture.The second largest refracting telescope in the world is the Yerkes Observatory 40 inch (102 cm) refractor, used for astronomical and scientific observation for over a century. The next largest refractor telescopes are the James Lick telescope, and the Meudon Great Refractor.

Most are classical great refractors, which used achromatic doublets on an equatorial mount. However, other large refractors include a 21st-century solar telescope which is not directly comparable because it uses a single element non-achromatic lens, and the short-lived Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900. It used a 78-inch (200 cm) Focault siderostat for aiming light into the Image-forming optical system part of the telescope, which had a 125 cm diameter lens. Using a siderostat incurs a reflective loss. Larger meniscus lenses have been used in later catadioptric telescopes which mix refractors and reflectors in the image-forming part of the telescope. As with reflecting telescopes, there was an ongoing struggle to balance cost with size, quality, and usefulness.

== List ==
This list includes some additional examples, such as the Great Paris telescope, which also used a mirror, and some solar telescopes which may have more complicated optical configurations. The SST has an optical aperture of 98 cm (39.37&quot;), although the lens itself is 110 cm (43.31&quot;). It is a single element lens whereas most of this list are doublets, with a crown and flint lens elements.

<doc id="213474" wikidata="Q4671123" url="?curid=213474" title="Academic Competition Federation">
<text>The Academic Competition Federation (ACF) is an organization, founded as the Academic Competition Foundation in 1991, that runs a national championship for collegiate quiz bowl as well as other tournaments.

==History==
During the mid-1980s, several schools began to prepare for College Bowl&#x27;s regional and national tournaments by holding independent invitationals, during which players became unsatisfied with College Bowl&#x27;s questions. Several scandals soon emerged, in which the 1988 College Bowl Regionals were found to have recycled nearly all of their questions from the 1982 College Bowl Regionals, independent tournaments were threatened with lawsuits from College Bowl, and the 1983 and 1985 College Bowl National Championship Tournaments were cancelled.

In response to these concerns, the University of Maryland and University of Tennessee stopped participating in College Bowl, followed a few years later by the Georgia Institute of Technology and a steadily increasing number schools.

In the fall of 1990, the then-coach of the University of Tennessee team Carol Guthrie joined with a few University of Maryland team members to found the Academic Competition Foundation. In 1991, they held the first ACF Nationals, which was won by the host Tennessee team over Georgia Tech. While departing from College Bowl&#x27;s structure, the tournament initially included a few elements carried over from College Bowl games. Those elements were later removed. No ACF Nationals tournament was held in 1992, but, beginning in 1993, Regionals and Nationals tournaments were held every year. By 1996, ACF Nationals was attracting 40 teams, but after the 1997 Nationals, Carol Guthrie announced that she and co-founder Jim Dendy were each resigning, and that ACF would go defunct.

In 1996, a new company called National Academic Quiz Tournaments (1996) was formed. NAQT was more organized than ACF in several respects, yet also included College Bowl-like features in their questions. University of Virginia student Andrew Yaphe thus organized the Academic Competition Federation to continue running the Regional and National tournaments along with John Sheahan and David Hamilton. The 1999 Nationals saw the first presentation of the Dr. N. Gordon Carper Lifetime Achievement Award, which recognizes individuals &quot;for meritorious services in sustaining and enriching collegiate academic competitions.&quot;

Following the rise to popularity of NAQT, the decline of College Bowl, and longstanding complaints about the difficulty of ACF, a decision was made in 2001 to focus on the accessibility of Academic Competition Federation tournaments. Despite those efforts, however, only sixteen teams attended ACF Nationals in 2001, and the future of the tournament seemed tenuous. Thus, a third, easier tournament, ACF Fall, was conceived by University of Kentucky player Kelly McKenzie, star player of the University of Kentucky team, and held in November 2001. This three-tournament lineup continued to 2009, then again from 2011 to 2019, with a fourth, intermediate difficulty, &quot;ACF Winter&quot; tournament held as part of the current circuit, as well as in 2009-10

==Format==

An ACF game consists of twenty ten-point tossups with thirty-point bonuses, a format now widely used by various collegiate and high school quiz bowl tournaments.

The ACF finals format is unique in that it involves awarding a tournament title outright to a team which is two or more games ahead in the standings of the second-place team at the end of the tournament proper. If two teams are tied, a one-game winner-take-all final is played. An advantaged final of up to two games is played if the first-place team is exactly one game ahead of the second-place team.

== ACF Tournaments ==

=== Overview ===
ACF tournaments follow the packet submission model, where editors organize the writing project and teams submit questions which will be used in competition. Depending on the experience of the players on a given team, that team may need to submit questions that will either comprise the entirety of a 20-tossup, 20-bonus packet, or that will be combined by editors with the question submissions of one or more teams to produce a full packet.

=== ACF Fall ===
ACF Fall is intended to be an easy college tournament for new college players or players with limited high school quiz bowl experience. ACF fall is played concurrently each year throughout the United States and internationally in Canada and the United Kingdom. With over 200 teams participating across all sites, ACF fall is the most-widely played college set in a given year. ACF Fall follows the packet-submission model.

=== ACF Winter ===
In 2009 and 2010, ACF organized the ACF Winter tournament. The target difficulty for ACF Winter was that of a regular college tournament, i.e. more difficult than ACF Fall and easier than ACF Regionals. In February 2020, ACF announced that it will be releasing ACF Winter again for the 2020-2021 season onwards.

=== ACF Regionals ===
ACF Regionals is the regular-difficulty (more difficult that ACF Fall) college tournament by which teams may qualify for ACF Nationals. In 2020, there were 11 concurrent ACF Regionals tournaments in the United States, 2 in Canada, and one in the United Kingdom. ACF Regionals follows the packet-submission model.

=== ACF Nationals ===
ACF Nationals is the final ACF tournament each season, and it has been run for more than 25 years. With the 48 strongest teams in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom competing together at a single tournament location, the questions at ACF Nationals are more difficult than those at ACF Regionals.

EACN was an ACF-sponsored collegiate novice tournament written and competed on from 2010 to 2013. With stricter eligibility requirements than ACF Fall, EACN was intended to be an introduction to collegiate quiz bowl for people who had not played previously.

==Carper Award recipients==
Dr. N. Gordon Carper Lifetime Achievement Award was established in 1999 to honor individuals for meritorious services in sustaining and enriching collegiate academic competitions. The award is presented annually to a member of the quizbowl community who exhibits the kind of dedication to and long-term support of academic competitions as exemplified by career of Dr. Carper. Beginning in 2019, ACF empowered a committee of former Carper winners who are also ACF members to select a second winner.

<text>Lidth&#x27;s jay (Garrulus lidthi), also known as the Amami jay, is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae native to Japan.

Measuring up to in total length, it is slightly larger than its close relative the Eurasian jay, with a proportionately stouter bill and also a longer tail. It has no discernible crest, with the head feathers a velvety black, the shoulders and back a deep purplish blue and all other parts a rich chestnut purple.

This jay has a very restricted distribution occurring only on the southern Japanese islands of Amami Ōshima and Tokunoshima in pine forest, sub-tropical woodland and cultivated areas especially around villages.

Food is largely made up of the nuts of the native chinkapin &quot;Castanopsis cuspidata&quot; but includes small reptiles and invertebrates of many types.

The bird nests in large cavities in trees but otherwise the nest is the same as that of the other two &quot;Garrulus&quot; species with 3–4 eggs.

The voice is similar to that of the Eurasian jay.

The species was threatened in the past by hunting for its feathers, which were used for decorating ladies&#x27; hats. Today it is threatened by introduced small Indian mongooses, which were brought to its range to control the venomous Okinawa pit viper. The species is fully protected under Japanese law and is increasing in numbers thanks to control of the mongooses.

The species name commemorates the Dutch zoologist Theodoor Gerard van Lidth de Jeude.

In 1965 it was chosen as the symbolic bird of Kagoshima Prefecture.

<doc id="213480" wikidata="Q6970103" url="?curid=213480" title="National Academic Quiz Tournaments">
<text>National Academic Quiz Tournaments, LLC is a question-writing and quiz bowl tournament-organizing company founded by former players in 1996. It is unique among U.S. quiz organizations for supplying questions and hosting championships at the middle school, high school, and college levels. NAQT operates out of Shawnee, Kansas and Minneapolis–Saint Paul.

The company mostly writes practice questions and questions for high school and middle school invitational tournaments, as well as for some game shows. Its involvement in college quiz bowl is mostly restricted to sectional tournaments and the Intercollegiate Championship Tournament.

== Rules ==
NAQT&#x27;s rules are quite similar to other quiz bowl tournament&#x27;s rules. These are about qualification, packets, and gameplay.

=== Qualification ===
To qualify for the MSNCT or HSNCT, a team from a school must get certain place depending on pool size, or teams playing. A school can get more teams also depending on pool size. The events which you must qualify at must be organized and accepted and using NAQT packets.

=== Packets ===
NAQT creates their own packets for tournaments along for studying, such as specific subject, lightning rounds, Thumbs Up! and more. They consist of 24 tossups and 24 bonuses. For certain packets, tossups and bonuses are on the same page, but for HSNCT, MSNCT, and SSNCT, the tossups and bonuses are on separate pages. They consist of clues that become easier and end in &#x27;For 10 points&#x27;. They will also provide pronunciation on certain words and provide what to accept, prompt, or say is incorrect.

=== Gameplay ===
The rules about negs and powers are that negs give -5, but if another team interrupts and gets it wrong, it is a 0. Correct answers before the power mark, or (*), give 15 points. Protests can be made at timeouts, halftime, or the end of the game. If a player answers incorrectly, their team is locked for the tossup. Bounce-backs are not allowed. Timeouts can be called at the very beginning of any tossup, but a team is limited to 1 tossup per match. A score-check is allowed during the timeouts and halftime.

== At the college level ==

The ICT is divided into divisions, unlike ACF Nationals, so that a clear undergraduate champion is determined (all formats allow graduate students to compete in some form).

===Collegiate divisions===

====Division I Overall====
NAQT&#x27;s eligibility rules state that any student taking at least three credit hours towards a degree at a university may compete on that university&#x27;s team, and indeed may not compete independently if such a team exists. If no program exists at their university&#x27;s campus, they may compete on the team for another campus of the same university, with the provision that they must leave that team should their home campus organize a program.

If any member of the team has an undergraduate degree, the team competes in the Division I competition, and is only eligible for the open championship (i.e. the overall championship).

====Division I Undergraduate====
At Sectional Championship Tournaments (SCTs) and the Intercollegiate Championship Tournament (ICT), teams that do not meet the Division II requirements play together. However, awards are given, including bids to the ICT, for the top undergraduate team. A team is eligible for the undergraduate championship if all members of the team are undergraduate students, and none of them have played in four years of NAQT collegiate competition prior to the current year. The undergraduate championship was first awarded in 1998.

====Division II====
Also introduced in 1998, Division II is intended to give first- and second-year students an opportunity to compete against other players and teams of the same level of experience. The rules of Division II eligibility are that one must be eligible for DI Undergraduate (i.e. no degree, and less than four years of experience), and in no year prior qualified for or participated in ICT.

Exceptions to the eligibility rules have been granted to deal with special circumstances in past years; however, as they are controversial when they occur, they do not occur often.

====Community colleges====
Two-year colleges usually compete in separate SCTs each February (it is permitted, but rare, for teams from these schools to compete in DI). Eight teams qualify for the Division II ICT, where they compete alongside other DII teams in a manner analogous to that of DI Undergraduate teams. However, students at two-year colleges are exempt from the DII eligibility restrictions. In fact, they have three years of eligibility at the DII level.

;Notes
==At the high school level==
Teams qualify to the High School National Championship Tournament through a variety of methods. Most commonly, a team qualifies by finishing in the top 15% of the field at a tournament that uses NAQT questions. If a school wants to send more than one team to nationals, the school must qualify all said teams at the same time during a single tournament.

The small school award is given to a public school with a non-selective admissions policy and less than 500 students in grades 10 through 12. Up until and including 2013, the small school champion was decided on a playoff between top finishing teams at the High School National Championship Tournament. Since 2014, a separate national championship tournament has been held for small schools.

==At the middle school level==
For the 2010–2011 academic year, NAQT has introduced a program for middle school. A corresponding middle school national championship, called the MSNCT, was held in 2011 in Chicago.

;Notes
==Jeopardy!==
Various NAQT employees and former NAQT players have appeared on the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Over 30 NAQT players or employees have participated on the show, including 17 who qualified for the Ultimate Tournament of Champions, including two finalists, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings. Jennings writes questions and edits the literature and mythology categories for NAQT. Due to the success of these players, adults trying out must now declare any affiliation to NAQT or quizbowl on their information sheet. (See &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; audition process for further discussion.)

In 2006, competitors in the High School National Championship Tournament were given the opportunity to audition for the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Teen Tournament and the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; College Championship. Ben Schenkel of Moravian Academy (Allentown, Pennsylvania) qualified for the Teen Tournament at this tryout, and finished as the tournament&#x27;s first runner-up. Meryl Federman of Livingston High School (Livingston, New Jersey) qualified for the second edition of the teen tournament, called the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Teen Tournament Summer Games, and won.

<text>NBA Jam is a basketball video game developed and published by Midway for arcades in 1993. It is the first entry in the &quot;NBA Jam&quot; series. The project leader for this game was Mark Turmell.

&quot;NBA Jam&quot; was the third basketball video game released by Midway, after &quot;TV Basketball&quot; (1974) and &quot;Arch Rivals&quot; (1989). The gameplay of &quot;NBA Jam&quot; is based on &quot;Arch Rivals&quot;, which was also a 2-on-2 basketball game. However, it was the release of &quot;NBA Jam&quot; that brought mainstream success to the genre.

The release of &quot;NBA Jam&quot; popularized a subgenre of basketball based around fast action and exaggerated realism, a formula Midway later applied to the sports of hockey (&quot;NHL Open Ice&quot; and &quot;NHL Hitz&quot;), American football (&quot;NFL Blitz&quot;), and baseball (&quot;MLB Slugfest&quot;).

==Gameplay==
&quot;NBA Jam&quot; is a two-on-two basketball video game featuring NBA-licensed teams and digitized likenesses of real players. Gameplay is exaggerated instead of realistic: players can jump extremely high and make slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24-second violations. This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow opponents out of the way. Additionally, if a player makes three baskets in a row, the character becomes &quot;on fire&quot; and has an unlimited turbo and increased shooting precision. The &quot;on fire&quot; mode continues until the other team scores, or until the player who is &quot;on fire&quot; scores four additional consecutive baskets while &quot;on fire&quot;.

The game contains many Easter eggs, special features, and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, pressing A five times and right five times on any Genesis controller will activate &quot;Super Clean Floors&quot;. This feature causes characters to fall if they run too fast or change direction too quickly. Players can also enter special codes to unlock hidden players, ranging from US President Bill Clinton to Hugo, the Charlotte Hornets mascot. On the arcade machine, there is also a hidden &quot;tank&quot; game that allows the player to drive a tank and shoot enemy tanks for a minute. Just before the court is shown at the start of a game, joysticks 1 and 2 must be moved down and all six of their buttons held down.

==Teams and players==
The original arcade version of &quot;NBA Jam&quot; has team rosters from the 1992–93 NBA season and the console versions use rosters from the 1993–94 NBA season. More up-to-date rosters were available in subsequent ports released for the Sega CD, Game Boy, and Game Gear in 1994. Midway did not secure the license to use Michael Jordan&#x27;s name or likeness (as Jordan himself owns the rights to his name and likeness and not the NBA), and as such he was not available as a player for the Chicago Bulls or any other team. Another notable absence from the home versions is Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, who was in the arcade version as a member of the Orlando Magic (and who later followed in Jordan&#x27;s footsteps in buying his name and likeness from the NBA). New Jersey Nets guard Dražen Petrović and Boston Celtics forward Reggie Lewis, both of whom died after the release of the arcade version, were also removed from the home versions.

A limited edition version of the game with an additional team composed of Gary Payton and Michael Jordan was developed primarily for Jordan and Payton&#x27;s personal use.

During development, Godzilla and Bart Simpson were planned to be secret characters, but were ultimately scrapped.

== Development ==
The game was devised after Midway&#x27;s previous arcade release &quot;Total Carnage&quot; failed to meet sales expectations. Lead designer and programmer Turmell wanted to develop a game with a wider appeal and decided to mix the digitized graphics of some of Midway&#x27;s previous titles to create a title similar to Midway&#x27;s previous basketball game &quot;Arch Rivals&quot;. Midway was able to procure a license from the NBA, paying royalties of $100 for each arcade cabinet sold. The NBA initially reacted negatively to the game feeling that an arcade game was wrong for the branding; however, after a second pitch, they eventually became convinced of its potential.
In one of Midway&#x27;s original pitch videos to the NBA, they stated that they planned on including various additional features. These included different camera angles, tips from coaches, instant replays and a first-person view on fast breaks. None of these features were included in the final game. The graphics for the NBA players were created from digitized video footage of several amateur basketball players, including future NBA player Stephen Howard. These players were available as secret characters in certain versions of the game. 
Turmell recounted, &quot;My big ideas in &quot;NBA Jam&quot; were to do the spectacular dunks and two-on-two basketball, but the whole game was very much a team effort. For instance, someone else came up with the idea of attributes, giving different players different abilities.&quot;

In 2008, Turmell confirmed a long-held suspicion that the game had a bias against the Chicago Bulls. According to Turmell, a Detroit Pistons fan, the game was programmed such that the Bulls would miss last-second shots in close games against the Pistons.

Iguana Entertainment handled the conversion of the game to home consoles. According to Iguana president Jeff Spangenberg, including the time spent on learning the then-new PlayStation hardware, the PlayStation version took six months to develop. The Saturn version took longer to develop, in part because of the greater complexity of the hardware, but also because Iguana Entertainment did not have access to the Sega Graphics Library operating system (which was used to facilitate the Saturn versions of &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; and &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, among other games). The Game Gear and PlayStation ports were programmed by Iguana UK employee Chris Kirby, with the Sega Saturn version coded by Darren Tunnicliff. Steve Snake, who would later create the Genesis emulator Kega Fusion, made the 32X version.

The game was written entirely in assembly language. The game had a marketing budget of $10 million.

==Reception==
The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release. In the United States, it topped the monthly &quot;RePlay&quot; charts for upright arcade cabinets from April 1993 through summer to October 1993. &quot;RePlay&quot; listed it as America&#x27;s top-grossing arcade game of Summer 1993. The game&#x27;s US revenue in 1993 exceeded the ( adjusted for inflation) domestic box office gross of the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; the same year. &quot;NBA Jam&quot; was America&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game of 1993. Individual machines at the time were earning up to $2400 per week, setting the all-time record for the highest per-unit arcade earnings in the United States. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;NBA Jam&quot; on their August 15, 1993 issue as the fourth most successful upright arcade unit of the month. The game grossed over worldwide in its first twelve months. , the arcade game has sold more than 20,000 arcade units and generated a lifetime revenue of .

On consoles in the United States it was the top-selling Sega Genesis, Super NES and Game Gear game in March 1994, holding the top-spot on Sega systems for April as well. It was the second best-selling home video game of 1994 in the United States (below &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;), with the Genesis version outselling the Super NES version. The console ports sold copies in 1994, more than cartridges worldwide by February 1995, and over within a year. , the Genesis and Super NES versions sold a combined copies worldwide.

===Critical response===
The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Super NES version a unanimous score of 9 out of 10 and their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award. They praised its graphics, sounds, and the four-player mode, and remarked that the gameplay is easy to pick up and incredibly fun even for people who don&#x27;t like sports games. Reviewing the Genesis version, Mike Weigand commented that &quot;The voices are fuzzy and the colors are a bit bland&quot;, but that the game is still very fun. &quot;EGM&quot; rated the Game Gear version as weaker than either the SNES or Genesis versions, chiefly due to the removal of most of the jams, but said it is still worthwhile for Game Gear owners.

&quot;GamePro&quot; praised the Sega CD version&#x27;s updated roster, more intuitive controls, and improved audio with &quot;more voice samples, more music, and more sound effects than any other home version.&quot; However, they criticized the graphics as much worse than in the Super NES and arcade versions, complained of long load times, and concluded that the improvements were not enough to make the game worthwhile for those who already had a home version of &quot;NBA Jam&quot;.

&quot;GamePro&quot; commented of the Game Boy version, &quot;Obviously the GB is far too limited a system to capture more than a fraction of what made NBA Jam an arcade smash, but at least it has that fraction.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Sega CD version of the game, and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s good, but it could have been so much more.&quot;

In 1995, Flux magazine rated the arcade version 19th in their &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;NBA Jam&quot; at number 99 in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that &quot;Despite it having been flogged to death by Acclaim at home and now in the arcades, &quot;NBA Jam&quot; is still a terrific game, especially in the arcade with four players.&quot; In 2017, Gamesradar ranked NBA Jam 23rd on its &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time.&quot; IGN listed the NBA Jam 36th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games.&quot; They praised the game saying: &quot;Professional basketball has never been as much fun as in NBA Jam&quot;. They also praised the secret playable characters.

===&quot;Tournament Edition&quot;===
Reviewing the 32X version, &quot;GamePro&quot; opined that people who already own the Genesis version should not bother with the 32X one, but summarized that &quot;Despite some sloppy rough edges, Jam&#x27;s classic run-n-gun gameplay brings much-needed excitement to the cart-starved 32X.&quot; The two sports reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said the 32X version was the most accurate conversion of the arcade game to date. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the 32X version of &quot;NBA Jam Tournament Edition&quot;, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;&quot;NBA Jam T.E.&quot; is a good game, but it is just as good on the Genesis and SNES, and shows no signs of 32-bit gaming. While there have been some decent games for the 32X, this is yet one more of the many disappointments.&quot;

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, after enumerating the improvements &quot;Tournament Edition&quot; offers over the original game, concluded, &quot;What does all this equal? Same game (albeit a good one), new package! Only &quot;Jam&quot; fanatics and the two guys who don&#x27;t own the original need slam down the cash for this rehash.&quot;

A &quot;GamePro&quot; critic covered the &quot;Tournament Edition&quot; release and was less forgiving of the Game Boy version&#x27;s technical flaws, complaining of sprites with too little detail to discern which player is which during play, and summarizing the conversion as &quot;a pale imitation of an otherwise great game.&quot;

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s two sports reviewers highly praised the PlayStation version as a precise conversion with good enhancements. &quot;Next Generation&quot; concurred and declared it the best version of the game to date. Videohead of &quot;GamePro&quot; disagreed, saying the PlayStation version conspicuously lacks graphical details and voice clips from the arcade version and suffers from overly tough A.I.

Steve Merrett of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; gave the Saturn version an 89%, declaring it &quot;A perfect conversion of one of the most original coin-ops around.&quot; He particularly praised the reliance on timing and precision over complex button combinations, and the game&#x27;s high playability in general, saying it &quot;ensures a return for late-night rematches whilst the graphically-stunning games are gradually coated in dust.&quot; Both &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; and &quot;Maximum&quot; were impressed with the Saturn version&#x27;s retention of all the considerable content of the arcade version. However, the reviewer for &quot;Maximum&quot; added that it nonetheless failed to offer any game-changing features that would make buying it worthwhile to anyone who already owned the Genesis or Super NES version.

&quot;GamePro&quot; commented that the Jaguar version is competent but far inferior to the PlayStation version. The two sports reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; were slightly more pleased with the conversion but felt it pointless since there had already been so many versions of the game, and the Jaguar release fails to offer anything new.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;NBA Jam Tournament Edition&quot; an A and wrote that &quot;The latest upgrade, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, of the two-on-two in-your-face hoopfest boasts the participation of fully one third of the NBA&#x27;s roster. And the graphics and sound are astounding-not only is playing this game like watching TV, but so is listening to it, with unnervingly accurate commentary that precisely follows the action of the game. Loads of hidden tricks and guest appearances make this one an arcade slam dunk.&quot;

In 1995, Total! ranked the game 8th in its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games&quot;. In 1998, Saturn Power listed the Sega Saturn version 89th in their &quot;Top 100 Sega Saturn Games.&quot; In 2018, Complex named NBA Jam Tournament Edition 44th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot;

==Legacy==
===&quot;Tournament Edition&quot;===
An update named &quot;NBA Jam Tournament Edition&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;NBA Jam T.E.&quot;) was released in arcades. &quot;NBA Jam T.E.&quot; included updated rosters, new features and Easter eggs combined with the same gameplay of the original. Jon Hey created new music specifically for &quot;NBA Jam: T.E.&quot; to replace the original &quot;NBA Jam&quot; music. Teams now consisted of three players (though only two could be on the court at any time; in practice, the extra player meant greater variety in lineups), with the exception of the new &quot;Rookies&quot; team, which consists of five players, all picked in the 1994 NBA draft. Players could be substituted into the game between quarters. The game also featured new hidden teams and secret playable characters. Early versions of the game included characters from Midway&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games. Players were also assigned more attributes, including clutch and fatigue levels. In addition, the game also introduced features such as a &quot;Tournament&quot; mode that turned off computer assistance and on-court hot spots that allowed for additional points or special slam dunks.

The test version of &quot;NBA Jam Tournament Edition&quot; included eight hidden characters which were taken out of the final version at the request of the NBA: Elviscious, Grim Reaper, Kongo, Raiden, Reptile, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Tim Coman. Midway also stated they would update all test version cabinets to remove these characters.

In addition to the arcade version, &quot;NBA Jam Tournament Edition&quot; was ported to the Super NES, Genesis, 32X, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Atari Jaguar, with the PlayStation port serving as a North American launch title.

After Midway produced 250,000 Genesis cartridges, the developer learned that the flash memory used for savegames only works if games are played in a specific order. After attempts to repair the cartridges failed, Midway included a flyer advising customers of &quot;AutoStat&quot; functionality that requires playing two games using initials &quot;XXX&quot; and &quot;NBA&quot; to initialize the cartridge, turning the flaw into an undocumented feature.

===Ports and sequels===
The &quot;NBA Jam&quot; games were ported to many home video game consoles and PC, published by Acclaim. The console versions were well known for featuring many new secret characters; the home versions of &quot;Jam T.E.&quot; even allowed the player to use then-President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and, on the Atari Jaguar version, Atari&#x27;s Vice President of Software Development Leonard Tramiel.

Acclaim later ended up winning the exclusive rights to use the &quot;NBA Jam&quot; name, and without Midway&#x27;s involvement, released a sequel, &quot;NBA Jam Extreme&quot;, in 1996. It features 3D graphics and Marv Albert doing commentary. The game received mixed reception. Acclaim continued to use the &quot;NBA Jam&quot; name on subsequent console games until the company closed in 2004, although the games were only mildly popular.

Midway released their own sequel in arcades in 1996, &quot;NBA Hangtime&quot;, which was better received. &quot;Hangtime&quot; featured refined 2D gameplay and added a create-a-player option among other new features. An update called &quot;NBA Maximum Hangtime&quot; was subsequently released for the arcade, and the game was ported to home systems. Midway later produced further entries in its NBA series with 3-D graphics, beginning with &quot;NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC&quot; in 1999, followed by the console-exclusive &quot;NBA Hoopz&quot; in 2001, which expanded the gameplay to 3-on-3, and the &quot;NBA Ballers&quot; series.

EA Sports, having acquired rights to the name, released a new version of &quot;NBA Jam&quot;, with the Wii version released on October 5, 2010, and PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions released the following month. Original &quot;NBA Jam&quot; creator Mark Turmell was hired to work on this new version in conjunction with EA Canada. Following the game&#x27;s critical and commercial success, a follow-up, &quot;NBA Jam: On Fire Edition&quot; was released for PSN on October 4, 2011, and XBLA on October 5, 2011.

In 2020, Tastemakers LLC released a 3/4 scale replica of the original NBA Jam cabinet featuring emulated versions of the original arcade game, along with &quot;Tournament Edition&quot; and &quot;Hangtime&quot;, with newly added online play.

===Other Midway sports series===

Midway also applied similar themes and designs to their other sports games, beginning with the 1996 hockey game &quot;NHL Open Ice&quot; and the American football game &quot;NFL Blitz&quot;, which proved to be a major success. Midway had also developed &quot;Power Up Baseball&quot; around 1996 based on the same concepts as &quot;NBA Jam&quot;, but it was cancelled as they found the game did not test well due to the large number of paid plays users would need to complete one game, among other issues.

After making the switch to develop console games exclusively, Midway continued to produce sports titles with arcade-style gameplay, with sequels to &quot;NFL Blitz&quot;, a new hockey series called &quot;NHL Hitz&quot;, the &quot;MLB Slugfest&quot; series of baseball games, and the soccer game &quot;RedCard 2003&quot;.

=== Popular culture ===
In popular sports culture, the phrases &quot;He&#x27;s heating up&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s on fire&quot;, and &quot;Boomshakalaka!&quot; are identified with &quot;NBA Jam&quot;. In the game, these catch-phrases describe when a player hits two or three shots in a row. When a player is &quot;on fire&quot;, the ball literally catches fire and singes the net. Voiced by Tim Kitzrow, the announcer is reminiscent of Marv Albert and has contributed numerous memorable lines to the basketball lexicon. The &quot;NBA Jam&quot; script was written solely by Jon Hey, although Kitzrow has stated that the lines were largely improvised.

&quot;NBA Jam&quot; also incorporates a slogan from Spike Lee&#x27;s alter-ego in his 1986 film &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;, Mars Blackmon, who was also featured in a Nike basketball shoe television commercial at the time. The &quot;NBA Jam&quot; commentator asks, &quot;Is it the shoes?&quot; after a player performs spectacularly. The 2010 game features a nod to this particular piece of commentary, when the commentator (Kitzrow reprising the role) sometimes exclaims &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;gotta&quot; be the shoes!&quot; under similar circumstances.

The upbeat, funky music written by Jon Hey was inspired by sports music themes and has been compared to George Clinton&#x27;s P-Funk All Stars. Funkadelic&#x27;s 1979 &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; shares the most similarity with the music of &quot;NBA Jam&quot; but was recorded more than a decade before &quot;NBA Jam&quot;″s music was written. The likeness of George Clinton was used as the character &quot;P. Funk&quot; in the console versions of &quot;NBA Jam Tournament Edition&quot;. The original &quot;NBA Jam&quot; arcade release and the &quot;NBA Jam T.E.&quot; arcade release had different music for the title screen and for each quarter.

In July 2009, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; creator Ed Boon revealed (on Twitter) that a &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; court was to be hidden in a console port of &quot;NBA Jam&quot; or &quot;NBA Hangtime&quot;.

In October 2019, writer Reyan Ali published a book on the game/series for Boss Fight Books called &quot;NBA Jam&quot; documenting the game&#x27;s development, success and impact on Midway afterward.

<text>Mark James Walter Cameron CBE (17 June 1911 – 26 January 1985) was a British journalist and writer, in whose memory the annual James Cameron Memorial Lecture is given.

== Early life ==
Cameron was born in Battersea, London, of Scottish parentage. His father, William Ernest Cameron, was a barrister who wrote novels under the pseudonym Mark Allerton and his mother was Margaret Douglas (née Robertson) Cameron.

== Career ==
Cameron began as an office dogsbody with the &quot;Weekly News&quot; in 1935. Having worked for several Scottish newspapers and for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in Fleet Street, he was rejected for military service in World War II. After the war, his experience of reporting on the Bikini Atoll nuclear experiments and the first British nuclear test in South Australia turned him into a pacifist and, later, a founding member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He continued to work for the &quot;Express&quot; until 1950, after which he briefly joined &quot;Picture Post&quot;, where he and photographer Bert Hardy covered the Korean War, winning the Missouri Pictures of the Year International Award for &quot;Inchon&quot;. Tom Hopkinson, the editor of &quot;Picture Post&quot;, lost his job as publisher when he defended the magazine&#x27;s coverage of atrocities committed by South Korean troops at a concentration camp in Pusan. Cameron wrote, &quot;I had seen Belsen, but this was worse. This terrible mob of men – convicted of nothing, un-tried, South Koreans in South Korea, suspected of being &#x27;unreliable&#x27;.&quot; The founder of the Hulton press, Edward G. Hulton, decided to &quot;kill&quot; the story.

In 1952 Cameron wrote an obituary essay for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, &quot;The King Is Dead&quot;, about the death of King George VI. Cameron then spent eight years with the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; until the paper ceased publication, in 1960. In 1953 he visited Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, in French Equatorial Africa (now Gabon) and found flaws in the practices and attitudes of Schweitzer and his staff. This was the subject of &quot;The Walrus and the Terrier&quot;, a BBC Radio 4 &quot;Afternoon Play&quot; by Christopher Ralling, broadcast on 7 April 2008.

In 1965, Cameron wangled his way into North Vietnam for interviews and photos (with photographer Romano Cagnoni) of Ho Chi Minh and its other leaders. His book &quot;Here Is Your Enemy&quot; was published in the United States, and his five-part series on North Vietnam was published in December 1965 in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where it was edited by journalist Anthony Lewis.

Cameron also did illustration work, especially in his early career. Working in Scotland for D. C. Thomson, he prepared drawings for sensationalist items in Thomson&#x27;s publications. He rebelled when asked to draw a picture of a murdered young girl, embellishing it with excess blood and grisly detail. Called to Thomson&#x27;s office, he was rebuked merely for exposing her underwear.

Cameron became a broadcaster for the BBC after the war, writing and presenting such television series as &quot;Cameron Country&quot;, and numerous single documentaries. An unusual example was &quot;Edgar Wallace: The Man Who Made His Name&quot;, a television biography of the thriller writer and journalist. He was a frequent contributor to &quot;Up Sunday&quot;, a magazine show that featured him and other commentators talking to the camera about topics of interest to them. Cameron also wrote a radio play, &quot;The Pump&quot; (1973), based on his experience of open heart surgery, which won a Prix Italia award in 1973. In his last years, he wrote a column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Cameron wrote two volumes of autobiography: &quot;Point of Departure&quot;, a chronicle of his life, and &quot;An Indian Summer&quot;, about his relationship with India, his marriage to his third wife, Moni, originally of Indian nationality, and his serious car accident and near death in Calcutta.

==Personal life==
Cameron&#x27;s first wife, Elma, died in childbirth near the start of World War II. Before she died she gave birth to their daughter, also Elma (Eleanor Margaret). 
He later married Elizabeth Marris (who already had a son, Desmond Roderic O’Conor, by a previous marriage to Denis O&#x27;Conor Don). He also had a son, Fergus, with Elizabeth. 
In 1971 he married Moneesha (&quot;Moni&quot;) Sarkar. 
James Cameron died of a stroke in his sleep on 26 January 1985. He was 73.

Among his literary relatives are the Gighan poet the Rev Kenneth Macleod – of &quot;The Road to the Isles&quot; fame – and the writer the Rev Dr John Urquhart Cameron of St Andrews.

<text>Fleet Street is a street in Central London, England. It runs west to east from Temple Bar at the boundary of the Cities of London and Westminster to Ludgate Circus at the site of the London Wall and the River Fleet from which the street was named.

The street has been an important through route since Roman times. During the Middle Ages, businesses were established and senior clergy lived there; several churches remain from this time including Temple Church and St Bride&#x27;s. The street became known for printing and publishing at the start of the 16th century and by the 20th century, most British national newspapers operated here. Much of the industry moved out in the 1980s after News International set up cheaper manufacturing premises in Wapping, but some former newspaper buildings are listed and have been preserved. The term &quot;Fleet Street&quot; remains a metonym for the British national press, and pubs on the street once frequented by journalists remain popular.

Fleet Street has a significant number of monuments and statues along its length, including the dragon at Temple Bar and memorials to a number of figures from the British press, such as Samuel Pepys and Lord Northcliffe. The street is mentioned in several works by Charles Dickens and is the home of the fictional murderer Sweeney Todd.

==Geography==
Fleet Street is named after the River Fleet, which runs from Hampstead to the River Thames at the western edge of the City of London. It is one of the oldest roads outside the original city and was established by the Middle Ages. In the 13th century, it was known as Fleet Bridge Street, and in the early 14th century it became known as Fleet Street.

The street runs east from Temple Bar, the boundary between the Cities of London and Westminster, as a continuation of the Strand from Trafalgar Square. It crosses Chancery Lane and Fetter Lane to reach Ludgate Circus by the London Wall. The road ahead is Ludgate Hill. The street numbering runs consecutively from west to east south-side and then east to west north-side. It links the Roman and medieval boundaries of the City after the latter was extended. The section of Fleet Street between Temple Bar and Fetter Lane is part of the A4, a major road running west through London, although it once ran along the entire street and eastwards past St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard towards Cannon Street.

The nearest London Underground stations are Temple, Chancery Lane, and Blackfriars tube/mainline station and the City Thameslink railway station. London Bus routes 4, 11, 15, 23, 26, 76 and 172 run along the full length of Fleet Street, while route 341 runs between Temple Bar and Fetter Lane.

==History==

===Early history===
Fleet Street was established as a thoroughfare in Roman London and there is evidence that a route led west from Ludgate by 200 AD. Local excavations revealed remains of a Roman amphitheatre near Ludgate on what was Fleet Prison, but other accounts suggest the area was too marshy for regular inhabitation by the Romans. The Saxons did not occupy the Roman city but established Lundenwic further west around what is now Aldwych and the Strand.

Many prelates lived around the street during the Middle Ages, including the Bishops of Salisbury and St Davids and the Abbots of Faversham, Tewkesbury, Winchcombe and Cirencester. Tanning of animal hides became established on Fleet Street owing to the nearby river, though this increased pollution leading to a ban on dumping rubbish by the mid-14th century. Many taverns and brothels were established along Fleet Street and have been documented as early as the 14th century. Records show that Geoffrey Chaucer was fined two shillings for attacking a friar in Fleet Street, though modern historians believe this is apocryphal.

An important landmark in Fleet Street during the late Middle Ages was a conduit that was the main water supply for the area. When Anne Boleyn was crowned queen following her marriage to Henry VIII in 1533, the conduit flowed wine instead of water. By the 16th century, Fleet Street, along with much of the City, was chronically overcrowded, and a royal proclamation in 1580 banned any further building on the street. This had little effect, and construction continued, particularly timber. Prince Henry&#x27;s Room over the Inner Temple gate dates from 1610 and is named after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I, who did not survive to succeed his father.
The eastern part of the street was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666, despite attempts to use the River Fleet to preserve it. Fire damage reached to about Fetter Lane, and the special tribunal of the &#x27;Fire Courts&#x27; was held at Clifford&#x27;s Inn, an inn of Chancery at the edge of the extent of the fire, to arbitrate on claimants&#x27; rights. Properties were rebuilt in the same style as before the fire.

During the early 18th century, a notorious upper-class gang known as the Mohocks operated on the street causing regular violence and vandalism. Mrs Salmon&#x27;s Waxworks was established at Prince Henry&#x27;s Room in 1711. It had a display of macabre and black-humoured exhibits, including the execution of Charles I; a Roman lady, Hermonie, whose father survived a sentence of starvation by sucking her breast; and a woman who gave birth to 365 children simultaneously. The waxworks were a favourite haunt of William Hogarth, and survived into the 19th century. The Apollo Society, a music club, was established in 1733 at the Devil Tavern on Fleet Street by composer Maurice Greene.

In 1763, supporters of John Wilkes, who had been arrested for libel against the Earl of Bute, burned a jackboot in the centre of the street in protest against Bute. It led to violent demonstrations and rioting in 1769 and 1794.

Tanning and other industries declined sharply after the River Fleet was routed underground in 1766. The street was widened during the late-19th century, when Temple Bar was demolished and Ludgate Circus was constructed. The headquarters of the Anti-Corn Law League were based at No. 67 Fleet Street, and a blue plaque marks the location.

===Printing and journalism===

Publishing started in Fleet Street around 1500 when William Caxton&#x27;s apprentice, Wynkyn de Worde, set up a printing shop near Shoe Lane, while at around the same time Richard Pynson set up as publisher and printer next to St Dunstan&#x27;s Church. More printers and publishers followed, mainly supplying the legal trade in the four Inns of Court around the area, but also publishing books and plays.

In March 1702 the first issue of London&#x27;s first daily newspaper, the &quot;Daily Courant&quot;, was published in Fleet Street. It was followed by the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;. The publisher John Murray was founded at No. 32 Fleet Street in 1762 and remained there until 1812, when it moved to Albemarle Street. The popularity of newspapers was restricted due to various taxes during the early 19th century, particularly paper duty. Peele&#x27;s Coffee-House at No. 177–178 Fleet Street became popular and was the main committee room for the Society for Repealing the Paper Duty, starting in 1858. The society was successful and the duty was abolished in 1861. Along with the repeal of the newspaper tax in 1855, this led to a dramatic expansion of newspaper production in Fleet Street. The &quot;penny press&quot; (newspapers costing one penny) became popular during the 1880s and the initial number of titles had consolidated into a few nationally important ones.

By the 20th century, Fleet Street and the area surrounding it were dominated by the national press and related industries. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; relocated to No. 121–8 Fleet Street in 1931, into a building designed by Sir Owen Williams. It was the first curtain wall building in London. It has survived the departure of the newspaper in 1989 and was restored in 2001. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was based at No. 135–142. These premises are both Grade II-listed. In the 1930s, No. 67 housed 25 separate publications; by this time the majority of British households bought a daily paper produced from Fleet Street.

In the late 20th century new technology in printing and publishing and changes in labour practices led to the newpapers printing industry and journalists leaving Fleet Street. In 1986 News International owner Rupert Murdoch caused controversy when he moved publication of &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; away from Fleet Street to new premises in Wapping, East London. Murdoch believed it was impossible to produce a newspaper profitably on Fleet Street and the power of the print unions, the National Graphical Association (NGA) and the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT), was too strong (an opinion endorsed by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher). All Fleet Street print staff were sacked and new staff from the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union were brought in to operate the presses at Wapping using modern computer-operated technology, rendering the power of the old unions obsolete. The resulting Wapping dispute featured violent protests at Fleet Street and Wapping that lasted over a year, but ultimately other publishers followed suit and moved out of Fleet Street towards Canary Wharf or Southwark. Reuters was the last major news outlet to leave Fleet Street, in 2005. In the same year, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; announced they were returning to the centre of London from Canary Wharf to new premises in Victoria in 2006.

Some publishers have remained on Fleet Street. The London office of D.C. Thomson &amp; Co., creator of &quot;The Beano&quot;, is at No. 185. The Secretariat of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association is at No. 17, as is Wentworth Publishing, an independent publisher of newsletters and courses. &quot;The Associated Press&quot; has an office in Fleet Street as did &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; until 2013 when it moved to Golders Green. The British Association of Journalists is based at No. 89 while Metro International are at No. 85.

Though many prominent national newspapers have moved away from Fleet Street, the name is still synonymous with the printing and publishing industry. In the adjacent St. Brides Lane is the St Bride Library, holding a specialist collection relating to the type and print industry and providing courses in printing technology and methods. On the wall of Magpie Alley, off Bouverie Street, is a mural depicting the history of newspapers in the area.

The &quot;Daily Express&quot; was the last newspaper to be printed on Fleet Street on 17 November 1989, in their former premises at 120 Fleet Street.The last two journalists to work for the Dundee-based &quot;Sunday Post&quot;, left in 2016, as the paper closed its London offices.
===Modern history===
Despite the domination of the print industry, other businesses were also established on Fleet Street. The Automobile Association was established at No. 18 Fleet Street in 1905. Since the post-Wapping migration, Fleet Street is now more associated with the investment banking, legal and accountancy professions. For example, The Inns of Court and barristers&#x27; chambers are down alleys and around courtyards off Fleet Street itself and many of the old newspaper offices have become the London headquarters for various companies. One example is Goldman Sachs, whose offices are in the old Daily Telegraph and Liverpool Echo buildings of Peterborough Court and Mersey House.

C. Hoare &amp; Co, England&#x27;s oldest privately owned bank, has been operating in Fleet Street since 1672. Child &amp; Co., now a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, claims it is the oldest continuous banking establishment in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1580 and has been based at No.1 Fleet Street, adjacent to Temple Bar, since 1673. The law firm Freshfields moved to No. 65 Fleet Street in 1990.

==Notable buildings==
In the High Middle Ages senior clergymen had their London palaces in the street. Place-names surviving with this connection are Peterborough Court and Salisbury Court after their respective Bishops&#x27; houses here; apart from the Knights Templars&#x27; establishment the Whitefriars monastery is recalled by Whitefriars Street and the remains of its undercroft have been preserved in a public display area. A Carmelite church was established on Fleet Street in 1253, but it was destroyed during the Reformation in 1545.

Today three churches serve the spiritual needs of the three &#x27;communities&#x27; associated with the area of the street. Temple Church was built by the Knights Templar in 1162 and serves the legal profession. St Bride&#x27;s Church was established as early as the 6th century and was later designed by Sir Christopher Wren in a style that complemented St Mary Le Bow further east in the City. It remains the London church most associated with the print industry. St Dunstan-in-the-West also dates from the 12th century supplements these as the local parish (as opposed to guild church) and is the London home for the Romanian Orthodox church.
To the south lies an area of legal buildings known as the Temple, formerly the property of the Knights Templar, which at its core includes two of the four Inns of Court: the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple. There are many lawyers&#x27; offices (especially barristers&#x27; chambers) in the vicinity. The gatehouse to Middle Temple Lane was built by Sir Christopher Wren in 1684. To the west, at the junction with Strand are the Royal Courts of Justice whilst at the eastern end of the street the Old Bailey is near Ludgate Circus.

As a principal route leading to and from the City, Fleet Street was especially noted for its taverns and coffeehouses. Many notable persons of literary and political fame such as Samuel Johnson frequented these, and journalists would regularly meet in pubs to collect stories. Some have survived to the 21st century and are grade II listed: Ye Olde Cock Tavern at No. 22, The Tipperary at No. 66, the Old Bell at No. 95, the Punch Tavern at No. 98 and Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese at No. 145. The El Vino wine bar moved to No. 47 in 1923, quickly becoming popular with lawyers and journalists. Women were not allowed in the bar until 1982, and then only because of a court order. The Old Bank of England, which from 1888 to 1975 was a trading house for the country&#x27;s central bank, is now a Grade II listed pub.

Since 1971, the southern side of the street has been part of the Fleet Street Conservation Area, which ensures buildings are regularly maintained and the character of the street is preserved. The area expanded to the north side in 1981.

== Monuments and statues ==
The area around Fleet Street contains numerous statues and memorials to prominent public figures. At the north-eastern corner is a bust of Edgar Wallace, and a full-length representation of Mary, Queen of Scots in a first-floor niche at No. 143–144 commissioned by John Tollemache Sinclair. Above the entrance to the old school-house of St Dunstan&#x27;s is a statue of Queen Elizabeth I provided for the then new Ludgate in 1586 by William Kerwin; it was moved to here following the gate&#x27;s demolition in 1776. Adjacent to this is a bust of Lord Northcliffe, the newspaper proprietor, co-founder of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. At No. 72 is a bust of the Irish journalist and MP TP O&#x27;Connor, constructed in 1934 by F. W. Doyle-Jones.

On the southern side of the street nearby memorials and monuments include the Temple Bar Memorial where the Temple Bar (a gateway) used to stand until it was removed in 1878. The marker was designed by Sir Horace Jones in 1880. It has a statue of a dragon at the top (sometimes called &quot;the Griffin&quot;), and a statue of Queen Victoria in a niche in the side.

In the Inner Temple Gardens is a memorial to Charles Lamb. In Salisbury Square there is an obelisk commemorating Robert Waithman, mayor of London between 1823 and 1833, and a blue plaque commemorating the birthplace of diarist and naval secretary Samuel Pepys.

==Notable residents==
Several writers and politicians are associated with Fleet Street, either as residents or regulars to the various taverns, including Ben Jonson, John Milton, Izaak Walton, John Dryden, Edmund Burke, Oliver Goldsmith and Charles Lamb. The lexicographer Samuel Johnson lived at Gough Square off Fleet Street between 1748 and 1759; the building has survived into the 21st century. The cartographer John Senex owned a map store, The Sign of the Globe, on Fleet Street between 1725 and his death in 1736. Wynkyn de Worde was buried in St. Bride&#x27;s Church in 1535, as was poet Richard Lovelace in 1657, while Samuel Pepys was baptised there in 1633.

The Royal Society was based in Crane Court from 1710 to 1782, when it moved to Somerset House on the Strand.

==Cultural references==
The barber Sweeney Todd is traditionally said to have lived and worked during the 18th century in Fleet Street, where he would murder customers and serve their remains as pie fillings. An urban myth example of a serial killer, the character appears in various English language works starting in the mid-19th century. Adaptations of the story include the 1936 George King film, the 1979 Stephen Sondheim musical, and the 2007 Tim Burton film based on the musical, all titled &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;.

Fleet Street is mentioned in several of Charles Dickens&#x27;s works. The eponymous club in &quot;The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, is set in the street, as is Tellson&#x27;s Bank in &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. The poet John Davidson wrote two works in the late 19th century titled the &quot;Fleet Street Eclogues&quot;. Arthur Ransome has a chapter in his &quot;Bohemia in London&quot; (1907) about earlier inhabitants of the street: Ben Jonson, the lexicographer Doctor Samuel Johnson, Coleridge, Hazlitt and Lamb; and about Temple Bar and the Press Club.

Fleet Street is a square on the British Monopoly board, in a group with the Strand and Trafalgar Square. One of the Chance cards in the game, &quot;You Have Won A Crossword Competition, collect £100&quot; was inspired by rival competitions and promotions between Fleet Street-based newspapers in 1930s, particularly the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

<doc id="213495" wikidata="Q34816" url="?curid=213495" title="Kathryn Bigelow">
<text>Kathryn Ann Bigelow (; born November 27, 1951) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. She has received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2010.

Bigelow made her directorial film debut with the outlaw biker film &quot;The Loveless&quot; (1981). She rose to prominence directing the thrillers &quot;Near Dark&quot; (1987), &quot;Blue Steel&quot; (1990), &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), &quot;Strange Days&quot; (1995), and &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot; (2002). For directing the war drama &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; (2008), Bigelow became the first woman to win the Academy Award for Best Director. She has since directed the spy thriller &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot; (2012), and the crime drama &quot;Detroit&quot; (2017).

She directed episodes of the NBC series &quot;&quot; (1998–1999), and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking for her work on the Netflix film &quot;Cartel Land&quot; (2015). She is known for her collaborations with Eric Red and Mark Boal.

==Early life and education==
Bigelow was born in San Carlos, California, the only child of Gertrude Kathryn (née Larson; 1917–1994), a librarian, and Ronald Elliot Bigelow (1915–1992), a paint factory manager. Her mother was of Norwegian descent. She attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, California.

Bigelow&#x27;s early creative endeavors were as a student of painting. She enrolled at San Francisco Art Institute in the fall of 1970 and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in December 1972. While enrolled at SFAI, she was accepted into the Whitney Museum of American Art&#x27;s Independent Study Program in New York City. For a while, Bigelow lived as an impoverished artist, staying with painter Julian Schnabel in performance artist Vito Acconci&#x27;s loft. She had a minor role in Richard Serra&#x27;s video &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (1974). Bigelow teamed up with Philip Glass on a real-estate venture in which they renovated distressed apartments downtown and sold them for a profit.

Bigelow entered the graduate film program at Columbia University, where she studied theory and criticism and earned her master&#x27;s degree. Her professors included Vito Acconci, Sylvère Lotringer, and Susan Sontag, as well as Andrew Sarris and Edward W. Said, and she worked with the Art &amp; Language collective and Lawrence Weiner. She also taught at the California Institute of the Arts. While working with Art &amp; Language Bigelow published an article, &quot;Not on the Development of Contradiction,&quot; in the short-lived Art &amp; Language magazine &quot;The Fox&quot;, and began a short film, &quot;The Set-Up&quot; (1978), which found favor with director Miloš Forman, then teaching at Columbia University, and which Bigelow later submitted as part of her MFA at Columbia.

==Directing career==
===1981–2002: Directorial debut and breakthrough===
Bigelow&#x27;s short &quot;The Set-Up&quot; is a 20-minute deconstruction of violence in film. The film portrays &quot;two men fighting each other as the semioticians Sylvère Lotringer and Marshall Blonsky deconstruct the images in voice-over.&quot; Bigelow asked her actors to actually beat and bludgeon each other throughout the film&#x27;s all-night shoot. Her first full-length feature was &quot;The Loveless&quot; (1981), a biker film that she co-directed with Monty Montgomery. It featured Willem Dafoe in his first starring role. Next, she directed &quot;Near Dark&quot; (1987), which she co-scripted with Eric Red. With this film, she began her lifelong fascination with manipulating movie conventions and genre. The main cast included three actors who had appeared in the film &quot;Aliens&quot;. In the same year, she directed a music video for the New Order song &quot;Touched by the Hand of God&quot;; the video is a spoof of glam metal imagery. Bigelow&#x27;s subsequent films, &quot;Blue Steel&quot;, &quot;Point Break&quot;, and &quot;Strange Days&quot;, &quot;merged her philosophically minded manipulation of pace with the market demands of mainstream film-making&quot;.

&quot;Blue Steel&quot; starred Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie police officer who is stalked by a psychopathic killer, played by Ron Silver. As with &quot;Near Dark&quot;, Eric Red co-wrote the screenplay. The film, originally bankrolled for $10 million, was shot on location in New York due to financial considerations and because Bigelow does not &quot;like movies where you see a welfare apartment and it&#x27;s the size of two football fields.&quot; Bigelow followed &quot;Blue Steel&quot; with the cult classic &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), which starred Keanu Reeves as an FBI agent who poses as a surfer to catch the &quot;Ex-Presidents&quot;, a team of surfing armed robbers led by Patrick Swayze who wear Reagan, Nixon, LBJ and Jimmy Carter masks when they hold up banks. &quot;Point Break&quot; was Bigelow&#x27;s most profitable &#x27;studio&#x27; film, taking approximately $80 million at the global box office during the year of its release, and yet it remains one of her lowest rated films, both in commercial reviews and academic analysis. Critics argued that it conformed to some of the clichés and tired stereotypes of the action genre and that it abandoned much of the stylistic substance and subtext of Bigelow&#x27;s other work.

In 1993, she directed an episode of the TV series &quot;Wild Palms&quot; and appeared in one episode as Mazie Woiwode (uncredited). Bigelow&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Strange Days&quot; was written and produced by her ex-husband James Cameron. Despite some positive reviews, the film was a commercial failure. Furthermore, many attributed the creative vision to Cameron, diminishing Bigelow&#x27;s perceived influence on the film. She directed three episodes of &quot;&quot; in 1997 and 1998. Based on Anita Shreve&#x27;s novel of the same name, Bigelow&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; is a portrait of two women trapped in suffocating relationships. In 2002, she directed &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot;, starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson, about a group of men aboard the Soviet Union&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine. The film fared poorly at the box office and was received with mixed reactions by critics.

===2008–present: Awards success and acclaim===

Bigelow next directed &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, which was first shown at the Venice Film Festival in September 2008, was the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival in May 2009, and theatrically released in the US in June 2009. It qualified for the 2010 Oscars as it did not premiere in an Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009. Set in post-invasion Iraq, the film received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; (according to Metacritic) and a 97% &quot;fresh&quot; rating from the critics aggregated by Rotten Tomatoes. The film stars Jeremy Renner, Brian Geraghty and Anthony Mackie, with cameos by Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes. She won the Directors Guild of America award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures (becoming the first woman to win the award) and also received a Golden Globe Award for Best Director nomination losing to James Cameron for &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009). In 2010, she won the award for Best Director and &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; won Best Picture at the 63rd British Academy Film Awards.
She became the first woman to receive an Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;The Hurt Locker.&quot; She was the fourth woman in history to be nominated for the honor, and only the second American woman. A competitor in the category was her ex-husband, James Cameron, who directed the sci-fi film &quot;Avatar.&quot; In her acceptance speech for her Academy Award, Bigelow surprised many audience members when she did not mention her status as the first woman to ever receive an Oscar for Best Director. In the past, Bigelow has refused to identify herself as a &quot;woman filmmaker&quot; or a &quot;feminist filmmaker.&quot; She has been criticized for the violence in her films by writers like Mark Salisbury, who asked in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Why does she make the kind of movie she makes?&quot; and by Marcia Froelke Coburn, who asked in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s a nice woman like Bigelow doing making erotic, violent vampire movies?&quot;

Bigelow&#x27;s next film was &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot;, a dramatization of American efforts to find Osama bin Laden. &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot; was acclaimed by film critics but also attracted controversy and strong criticism for its allegedly pro-torture stance. Bigelow won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director for the film, making her the first woman to win the award twice. She had already won previously for directing &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;. She was also the first woman to receive the National Board of Review Award for Best Director.

Bigelow collaborated with Mark Boal for the third time on the film &quot;Detroit&quot;, set during the 1967 Detroit riots. &quot;Detroit&quot; began filming in the summer of 2016 and was released in July 2017, around the time of the 50th anniversary of the riots, and on the anniversary day of the Algiers Motel incident, which is depicted in the film. John Boyega, Hannah Murray, Will Poulter, Jack Reynor, Anthony Mackie, and Joseph David-Jones starred in the film.

She served as executive producer of &quot;Triple Frontier&quot;, a film that she was originally going to direct. She gave up directing duties to J. C. Chandor to focus on other projects. Bigelow also directs commercials. She is represented internationally by commercial production company SMUGGLER, where she has directed commercials for the Army National Guard, Budweiser and AT&amp;T, some of which were broadcast during the Super Bowl. In 2022, Bigelow was nominated by the Directors Guild of America for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Commercials for Apple&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood In Your Pocket&quot;.

In May 2024, Netflix announced that Bigelow would be directing a new feature film for the streaming platform. The currently untitled project is reported to be &quot;centered on a group of White House officials scrambling to deal with an incoming missile attack&quot;. The cast includes Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Tracy Letts, Greta Lee, and Jared Harris.

==== Unreleased projects ====
== Film style ==
Bigelow has a shifting relationship with Hollywood and its conventional film standards and techniques. Her work &quot;both satisfies and transcends the demands of formula to create cinema that&#x27;s ideologically complex, viscerally thrilling, and highly personal&quot;. Social issues of gender, race, and politics are entrenched in her work of all genres.

While her films are often categorized in the action genre, she describes her style as an exploration of &quot;film&#x27;s potential to be kinetic&quot;. She often uses &quot;purpose-built&quot; camera equipment to create mobile shots. In many of her films, such as &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, &quot;Point Break&quot;, and &quot;Strange Days&quot;, she has used mobile and hand-held cameras.

Bigelow&#x27;s work is characterized by extensive violence. Most of her films include violent sequences and many revolve around the theme of violence. Violence has been a staple in her films from the beginning of her career. In her first short film &quot;The Set-Up&quot; (1978), two professors deconstruct two men beating each other up and reflect on the &quot;fascistic appeal of screen violence&quot;. For this film Bigelow asked the two actors to actually beat each other up in the film&#x27;s all-night shoot. This interest in violence seeped into her first full-length feature film &quot;The Loveless&quot;, starring Willem Dafoe, which follows a 1950s motorcycle gang&#x27;s visit to a small town and the ensuing violence that occurs. Her next film, &quot;Near Dark&quot;, follows a young boy who falls in love with a vampire after being bitten by her. The film was conceived as a Western but the genre was so unpopular at the time that Bigelow had to adjust her script and invert the genre conventions. She still used the violent staples of the genre including sieges, shoot-outs, and horseback chases. It is regarded for its combination of the Western and horror genre and its exploration of &quot;homosexuality and &#x27;white America&#x27;s illusion of safety and control. The film became a cult classic within the horror genre community. Bigelow herself saw it screened in Greenwich Village with a horror genre crowd.

&quot;Blue Steel&quot; was her first venture into the action film genre, with which she has stayed throughout her career and has found most success. The film revolves around a female police officer who is falsely accused of a murder and who in the process of clearing her name investigates a killing spree connected to the original murder. Similarly to &quot;Near Dark&quot;, Bigelow inverts the typical action genre conventions by placing a female protagonist at the center. The film digs deeply into feminist issues and is often taught and studied by feminist film scholars. Her next film &quot;Point Break&quot;, starring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze, was her breakout film in terms of mainstream success. The film follows a detective who goes undercover in a suspected criminal gang of surfers who primarily rob banks. It marks the first time that Bigelow used lengthy Steadicam tracking shots. It was also her biggest financial success yet, grossing $83.5 million worldwide with a budget of $24 million. Although her next film, &quot;Strange Days&quot;, which ruminates on the relationships between media, sex, race, class, and technology, had a budget of $42 million, it only grossed just under $8 million. Although the film flopped, it led Bigelow and her team to spend over a year developing a camera that intended to approximate human vision.

The commercial failure of &quot;Strange Days&quot; was followed by a stream of commercial and critical flops for Bigelow. Her films &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; and &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot; received negative reviews from critics and little attention from the general public. With her independently produced film &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; she made a commercial and critical comeback. This film was her transition into political and historical film. &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, which follows members of a bomb squad serving in the Iraq War, was Bigelow&#x27;s first venture into pseudo-documentary style film, abandoning the aesthetic stylization found in &quot;Strange Days&quot; and &quot;Near Dark&quot;. The film utilizes the genre&#x27;s tendency to use quick cuts, shaky camera, and rapid zooms. It also breaks with the conventional narrative structures of her previous films, following a more unorganized and experimental narrative structure. Her next film, &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot;, is widely seen as a direct extension of &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, going further in-depth of historical analysis and addressing issues of geopolitics and American foreign policy. The film was criticised for its depiction of the CIA&#x27;s torture practices.

Throughout her career, Bigelow has tended to go to extremes for her films. In &quot;Point Break&quot;, while filming the skydiving scene, Bigelow was on the airplane with a parachute on, as she filmed Patrick Swayze throw himself into the sky. During surfing scenes in the same film, she would either paddle on a longboard or lean over a nearby boat as far as possible to get shots of Keanu Reeves surfing. For the opening of &quot;Strange Days&quot; she controlled a crane that dropped a camera man off the edge of a tall building. For &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, Bigelow filmed in Jordan in up to heat.

==Other work==

In November 1976, she appeared in a political 56-minute film, entitled &quot;Struggle in New York&quot; which involved conceptual artists Art &amp; Language.

In the early 1980s, Bigelow modeled for a Gap advertisement. Her acting credits include Lizzie Borden&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;Born in Flames&quot; as a feminist newspaper editor, and as the leader of a cowgirl gang in the 1988 music video of Martini Ranch&#x27;s &quot;Reach&quot;, which was directed by James Cameron.

Bigelow was married to director James Cameron from 1989 to 1991.

<doc id="213497" wikidata="Q177076" url="?curid=213497" title="Caucasian Albania">
<text>Caucasian Albania is a modern exonym for a former state located in ancient times in the Caucasus, mostly in what is now Azerbaijan (where both of its capitals were located). The modern endonyms for the area are Aghwank and Aluank, among the Udi people, who regard themselves as descended from the inhabitants of Caucasian Albania. However, its original endonym is unknown.

The name Albania is derived from the Ancient Greek name and Latin , created from Greek sources that incorrectly translated the Armenian language. The prefix &quot;Caucasian&quot; is used to avoid confusion with Albania in the Balkans, which has no geographical or historical connections to Caucasian Albania.

Little is known of the region&#x27;s prehistory, including the origins of Caucasian Albania as a geographical and/or ethnolinguistic concept. In the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD, the area south of the Greater Caucasus and north of the Lesser Caucasus was divided between Caucasian Albania in the east, Caucasian Iberia in the center, Kolchis in the west, Armenia in the southwest and Atropatene to the southeast.

In 252, Caucasian Albania acknowledged the suzerainty of the Sasanian Empire, appearing among its provinces in Shapur I&#x27;s inscription at the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht. The kingdom would remain an integral part of the empire until its fall. By the end of the 3rd-century, the kings of Caucasian Albania were replaced with an Arsacid family, and would later be succeeded by another Iranian royal family in the 5th century AD, the Mihranids.

==Geonyms==

Aghuank (Old Armenian: &quot;Ałuankʿ&quot;, Modern Armenian: &quot;Aġvank’&quot;) is the Armenian name for Caucasian Albania. Armenian authors mention that the name derived from the word &quot;&quot; («աղու») meaning in Armenian. The term &quot;Aghuank&quot; is polysemous and is also used in Armenian sources to denote the region between the Kur and Araxes rivers as part of Armenia. In the latter case it is sometimes used in the form &quot;Armenian Aghuank&quot; or &quot;Hay-Aghuank&quot;.

The Armenian historian of the region, Movses Kaghankatvatsi, who left the only more or less complete historical account about the region, explains the name Aghvank as a derivation from the word &quot;&quot; (Armenian for sweet, soft, tender), which, he said, was the nickname of Caucasian Albania&#x27;s first governor Arran and referred to his lenient personality. Movses Kaghankatvatsi and other ancient sources explain &quot;Arran&quot; or &quot;Arhan&quot; as the name of the legendary founder of Caucasian Albania (Aghvan) or even of the Iranian tribe known as Alans (Alani), who in some versions was a son of Noah&#x27;s son Yafet. James Darmesteter, translator of the Avesta, compared &quot;Arran&quot; with &quot;Airyana Vaego&quot; which he also considered to have been in the Araxes-Ararat region, although modern theories tend to place this in the east of Iran.

The Parthian name for the region was &quot;Ardhan&quot; (Middle Persian: &quot;Arran&quot;). The Arabic was &quot;ar-Rān&quot;. In Georgian, it was known as რანი (&quot;Rani&quot;). In Ancient Greek, it was called . What its inhabitants were called is unknown.

==Geography==
In pre-Islamic times, Caucasian Albania/Arran was a wider concept than that of post-Islamic Arran. Ancient Arran covered all of eastern Transcaucasia, which included most of the territory of the modern-day Azerbaijan Republic and part of the territory of Dagestan. However, in post-Islamic times the geographic notion of Arran reduced to the territory between the Kura and Aras rivers.

Ancient Caucasian Albania lay on the south-eastern part of the Greater Caucasus mountains. It was bounded by Caucasian Iberia (present-day Georgia) to the west, by Sarmatia to the north, by the Caspian Sea to the east, and by the provinces of Artsakh and Utik in Armenia to the west along the Kura river. These boundaries, though, were probably never static—at times the territory of Caucasian Albania included land to the west of the Kura river.

Albania or Arran in Islamic times was a triangle of land, lowland in the east and mountainous in the west, formed by the junction of the Kura and Aras rivers, Mil plain and parts of the Mughan plain, and in the pre-Islamic times, corresponded roughly to the territory of the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan.

The districts of Albania were:

* Cambysene
* Getaru
* Elni/Xeni
* Begh
* Xolmaz
* Kapalak
* Hambasi
* Gelavu
* Hejeri
* Kaladasht
The kingdom&#x27;s capital in antiquity was Qabala (Gabala; Kapalak).

Classical sources are unanimous in making the Kura River (Cyros) the frontier between Armenia and Albania after the conquest of the territories on the right bank of Kura by Armenians in the 2nd century BC.

The original territory of Albania was approximately 23,000 km2. After 387 AD the territory of Caucasian Albania, sometimes referred to by scholars as &quot;Greater Albania,&quot; grew to about 45,000 km2. In the 5th century the capital was transferred to Partav in Utik&#x27;, reported to have been built in the mid-5th century by the King Vache II of Albania, but according to M. L. Chaumont, it existed earlier as an Armenian city.

In a medieval chronicle &quot;Ajayib-ad-Dunia&quot;, written in the 13th century by an unknown author, Arran is said to have been 30 &quot;farsakhs&quot; (200 km) in width, and 40 &quot;farsakhs&quot; (270 km) in length. All the right bank of the Kura River until it joined with the Aras was attributed to Arran (the left bank of the Kura was known as Shirvan). The boundaries of Arran have shifted throughout history, sometimes encompassing the entire territory of the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan, and at other times only parts of the South Caucasus. In some instances, Arran was a part of Armenia.

Medieval Islamic geographers gave descriptions of Arran in general, and of its towns, which included Barda, Beylagan, and Ganja, along with others.

==Ethnogenesis==

Originally, at least some of the Caucasian Albanians probably spoke Lezgic languages close to those found in modern Dagestan; overall, though, as many as 26 different languages may have been spoken in Caucasian Albania.

After the Caucasian Albanians were Christianized in the 4th century, part of the population was assimilated by the Armenians (who dominated in the provinces of Artsakh and Utik that were earlier detached from the Kingdom of Armenia) and Georgians (in the north), while the eastern parts of Caucasian Albania were Islamized and absorbed by Iranian and subsequently Turkic peoples (modern Azerbaijanis). Small remnants of this group continue to exist independently, and are known as the Udi people.
The pre-Islamic population of Caucasian Albania might have played a role in the ethnogenesis of a number of modern ethnicities, including the Azerbaijanis of Qabala, Zaqatala, Shaki, and Oguz; the Armenians of Oghuz and Shaki; the Georgians of Kakhetia and Hereti (Ingiloy); and the Laks, the Lezgins and the Tsakhurs of Daghestan.

===Alphabet and languages===

====Caucasian Albanian language====

According to Armenian medieval historians Movses Khorenatsi, Movses Kaghankatvatsi and Koryun, the Caucasian Albanian (the Armenian name for the language is Aghvaneren, the native name of the language is unknown) alphabet was created by Mesrob Mashtots, the Armenian monk, theologian and translator who is also credited with creating the Armenian alphabet. This alphabet was used to write down the Udi language, which was probably the main language of the Caucasian Albanians.

Koryun, a pupil of Mesrob Mashtots, in his book &quot;The Life of Mashtots&quot;, wrote about how his tutor created the alphabet:

Then there came and visited them an elderly man, an Albanian named Benjamin. And he (Mashtots) inquired and examined the barbaric diction of the Albanian language, and then through his usual God-given keenness of mind invented an alphabet, which he, through the grace of Christ, successfully organized and put in order.

A Caucasian Albanian alphabet of fifty-two letters, bearing resemblance to Georgian, Ethiopian and Armenian characters, survived through a few inscriptions, and an Armenian manuscript dating from the 15th century. This manuscript, Matenadaran No. 7117, first published by Ilia Abuladze in 1937 is a language manual, presenting different alphabets for comparison – Armenian alphabet, Greek, Latin, Syriac, Georgian, Coptic, and Caucasian Albanian among them. The alphabet was titled: &quot;Ałuanicʿ girn ē&quot; (, meaning, &quot;These are Albanian letters&quot;).

In 1996, Zaza Aleksidze of the Georgian Centre of Manuscripts discovered at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery at Mount Sinai, Egypt, a text written on parchment that had been reused in a Georgian palimpsest. In 2001 Aleksidze identified its script as Caucasian Albanian, and the text as an early lectionary dating to perhaps before the 6th century. Many of the letters discovered in it were not in the Albanian alphabet listed in the 15th-century Armenian manuscript.

Muslim geographers Al-Muqaddasi, Ibn-Hawqal and Estakhri recorded that a language which they called Arranian was still spoken in the capital Barda and the rest of Arran in the 10th century.

====Iranian languages====

Iranian contact in the region goes back to the Median and Achaemenid times. During this Arsacid dynasty of Caucasian Albania, the Parthian language spread in the region. It is possible that the language and literature for administration and record-keeping of the imperial chancellery for external affairs naturally became Parthian, based on the Aramaic alphabet. According to Toumanoff: &quot;the predominance of Hellenism, as under the Artaxiads, was now followed by a predominance of &quot;Iranianism&quot;, and, symptomatically, instead of Greek, as before, Parthian became the language of the educated&quot;.

With the establishment of the Sassanids, Middle Persian, a closely related language to Parthian, became an official language of the Sassanid Empire. At this time, Persian enjoyed even more success than the Caucasian Albanian language and the region was greatly affected by Iran. According to Vladimir Minorsky: &quot;The presence of Iranian settlers in Transcaucasia, and especially in the proximity of the passes, must have played an important role in absorbing and pushing back the aboriginal inhabitants. Such names as Sharvan, Layzan, Baylaqan, etc., suggest that the Iranian immigration proceeded chiefly from Gilan and other regions on the southern coast of the Caspian&quot;. The presence of the Persian language and Iranian culture continued during the Islamic era.

===Religion===
The original population of the Caucasus followed different pagan religions. Under Achaemenid, Parthian and especially Sassanid influence, Zoroastrianism also grew in the region. Christianity started to spread in the late 4th century in the Sassanid era.

The Arab conquest and the Chalcedonian crisis led to severe disintegration of the Church of Caucasian Albania. Starting from the 8th century, much of the local population converted to Islam. By the 11th century there already were conciliar mosques in Partaw, Qabala and Shaki; the cities that were the creed of Caucasian Albanian Christianity.

These Islamised groups would later be known as Lezgins and Tsakhurs or mix with the Turkic and Iranian population to form present-day Azeris, whereas those that remained Christian were gradually absorbed by Armenians or continued to exist on their own and be known as the Udi people.

The Caucasian Albanian tribes of Hereti were converted to Eastern Orthodoxy by Dinar, Queen of Hereti in the 10th century. The religious affairs of this small principality were now officially administered by the Georgian Orthodox Church. In 1010, Hereti became absorbed into the neighbouring Georgian kingdom of Kakheti. Eventually, in the early 12th century, these lands became part of the Georgian Kingdom under David the Builder finalising the process of their Georgianisation.

==History==
The history of Albania before the 6th century BC is unknown.

===Median and Achaemenid era===
According to one hypothesis, Caucasian Albania was incorporated in the Median empire, as early as the 7th or 6th century BC. However, an increasing Persian influence on the region is usually believed to be connected with the defence of Persia&#x27;s northern frontiers, from invading nomads. As early as the Achaemenid empire, measures may have been taken to fortify the Caucasian passes. By the mid-6th century BC, Albania has been incorporated in the Achaemenid empire; it was later controlled by the Achaemenid satrapy of Media. The building of fortifications and gates in and around Darband is traditionally ascribed to the Sassanid Empire.

===Hellenistic era===

The Greek historian Arrian mentions (perhaps anachronistically) the Caucasian Albanians for the first time in the battle of Gaugamela, where the Albanians, Medes, Cadussi and Sacae were under the command of Atropates. Albania first appears in history as a vassal state in the empire of Tigranes the Great of Armenia (95-56 BC). The kingdom of Albania emerged in the eastern Caucasus in 2nd or 1st century BC and along with the Georgians and Armenians formed one of the three nations of the Southern Caucasus. Albania came under strong Armenian religious and cultural influence.

Herodotus, Strabo, and other classical authors repeatedly mention the Caspians but do not seem to know much about them; they are grouped with other inhabitants of the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, like the Amardi, Anariacae, Cadusii, Albani (see below), and Vitii (Eratosthenes apud Strabo, 11.8.8), and their land (Caspiane) is said to be part of Albania (Theophanes Mytilenaeus apud Strabo, 11.4.5).

In the 2nd century BC parts of Albania were conquered by the Kingdom of Armenia, presumably from Medes (although possibly it was earlier part of Orontid Armenia).

The original population of the territories on the right bank of Kura before the Armenian conquest consisted of various autochthonous people. Ancient chronicles provide the names of several peoples that populated these districts, including the regions of Artsakh and Utik. These were Utians, Mycians, Caspians, Gargarians, Sakasenians, Gelians, Sodians, Lupenians, Balas[ak]anians, Parsians and Parrasians. According to Robert H. Hewsen, these tribes were &quot;certainly not of Armenian origin&quot;, and &quot;although certain Iranian peoples must have settled here during the long period of Persian and Median rule, most of the natives were not even Indo-Europeans&quot;. He also states that the several peoples of the right bank of Kura &quot;were highly Armenicized and that many were actually Armenians &quot;per se&quot; cannot be doubted&quot;. Many of those people were still being cited as distinct ethnic entities when the right bank of Kura was acquired by the Caucasian Albanians in 387 AD.

===Roman Empire===
There was an enduring relation of Albania with Ancient Rome.

The Latin rock inscription close to Boyukdash mountain in Gobustan, Baku, which mentions Legio XII Fulminata, is the world&#x27;s easternmost Latin inscription known. In Albania, Romans reached the Caspian Sea for the first time.

The Roman coins circulated in Caucasian Albania till the end of the 3rd century AD. Two denarii, which were unearthed in the 2nd-century BC layer, were minted by Clodius and Caesar. The coins of Augustus are ubiquitous. The Qabala treasures revealed the denarii of Otho, Vespasian, Trajan and Hadrian.

In 69-68 BC Lucullus, having overcome Armenian ruler Tigranes II, approached the borders of Caucasian Albania and was succeeded by Pompey.

After the 66-65 BC wintering Pompey launched the Iberian campaign. It is reported by Strabo upon the account of Theophanes of Mytilene who participated in it. As testified by Kamilla Trever, Pompey reached the Albanian border at modern Qazakh District of Azerbaijan. Igrar Aliyev showed that this region called Cambysene was inhabited mainly by stock-breeders at the time. When fording the Alazan river, he was attacked by forces of Oroezes, King of Albania, and eventually defeated them. According to Plutarch, Albanians &quot;were led by a brother of the king, named Cosis, who as soon as the fighting was at close quarters, rushed upon Pompey himself and smote him with a javelin on the fold of his breastplate; but Pompey ran him through the body and killed him&quot;. Plutarch also reported that &quot;after the battle, Pompey set out to march to the Caspian Sea, but was turned back by a multitude of deadly reptiles when he was only three days march distant, and withdrew into Lesser Armenia&quot;. The first kings of Albania were certainly the representatives of the local tribal nobility, to which attest their non-Armenian and non-Iranian names (Oroezes, Cosis and Zober in Greek sources).

The population of Caucasian Albania of the Roman period is believed to have belonged to either the Northeast Caucasian peoples or the South Caucasian peoples.
According to Strabo, the Albanians were a group of 26 tribes which lived to the north of the Kura river and each of them had its own king and language. Sometime before the 1st century BC they federated into one state and were ruled by one king.

Strabo wrote of the Caucasian Albanians in the 1st century BC:
Albania is also mentioned by Dionysius Periegetes (2nd or 3rd century AD) who describes Albanians as a nation of warriors, living by the Iberians and the Georgians.

In 1899 a silver plate featuring Roman toreutics was excavated near Azerbaijani village of Qalagah.
The rock inscription near the south-eastern part of Boyukdash&#x27;s foot (70 km from Baku) was discovered on June 2, 1948, by Azerbaijani archaeologist Ishag Jafarzadeh. The legend is IMPDOMITIANO CAESARE·AVG GERMANIC L·IVLIVS MAXIMVS&gt; LEG XII·FVL. According to Domitian&#x27;s titles in it, the related march took place between 84 and 96. The inscription was studied by Russian expert Yevgeni Pakhomov, who assumed that the associated campaign was launched to control the Derbent Gate and that the XII Fulminata has marched out either from Melitene, its permanent base, or Armenia, where it might have moved from before. Pakhomov supposed that the legion proceeded to the spot continually along the Aras River. The later version, published in 1956, states that the legion was stationing in Cappadocia by that time whereas the centurion might have been in Albania with some diplomatic mission because for the talks with the Eastern rulers the Roman commanders were usually sending centurions.

In 1953 twelve denarii of Augustus were unearthed. In 1958 one denarius, coined in c. 82 AD, was revealed in the Şamaxı trove.

During the reign of Roman emperor Hadrian (117-138) Albania was invaded by the Alans, an Iranian nomadic group. This invasion promoted an alliance between Rome and the Albanians that was reinforced under Antoninus Pius in 140 AD. Sassanians occupied the area around 240 AD but after a few years, the Roman Empire regained control of Caucasian Albania.

In 297 the treaty of Nisibis stipulated the reestablishment of the Roman protectorate over Caucasian Iberia and Albania. But fifty years later Rome lost the area that since then remained an integral part of the Sasanian Empire.

===Parthian period===
Under Parthian rule, Iranian political and cultural influence increased in the region. Whatever the sporadic suzerainty of Rome, the country was now a part—together with Iberia (East Georgia) and (Caucasian) Albania, where other Arsacid branches reigned—of a pan-Arsacid family federation. Culturally, the predominance of Hellenism, as under the Artaxiads, was now followed by a predominance of &quot;Iranianism&quot;, and, symptomatically, instead of Greek, as before, Parthian became the language of the educated. An incursion in this era was made by the Alans who between 134 and 136 attacked Albania, Media, and Armenia, penetrating as far as Cappadocia. But Vologases persuaded them to withdraw, probably by paying them.

===Sassanid period===

In 252–253, Caucasian Albania, along with Caucasian Iberia and Greater Armenia, was conquered and annexed by the Sassanid Empire. Albania became a vassal state of the Sassanid Empire, but retained its monarchy; the Albanian king had no real power and most civil, religious, and military authority lay with the Sassanid marzban (military governor) of the territory.

The Roman Empire again obtained control of Caucasian Albania as a vassal state for a few years around 300 AD, but then the Sassanids regained control and subsequently dominated the area for centuries until the Arab invasions.

Albania was mentioned among the Sassanid provinces listed in the trilingual inscription of Shapur I at Naqsh-e Rustam.
In the middle of the 4th century, King Urnayr of Albania arrived in Armenia and was baptized by Gregory the Illuminator, but Christianity spread in Albania only gradually, and the Albanian king remained loyal to the Sassanids. After the partition of Armenia between Byzantium and Persia (in 387 AD), Albania with Sassanid help was able to seize from Armenia all the right bank of the river Kura up to river Araxes, including Artsakh and Utik.

In the mid-5th century, the Sassanid King Yazdegerd II passed an edict requiring all the Christians in his empire to convert to Zoroastrianism, fearing that Christians might ally with Roman Empire, which had recently adopted Christianity as its official religion. This led to a rebellion of Albanians, along with Armenians and Georgians. At the Battle of Avarayr, the allied forces of Caucasian Albania, Georgia, and Armenia, devoted to Christianity, suffered defeat at the hands of the Sassanid army. Many of the Armenian nobility fled to the mountainous regions of Albania, particularly to Artsakh, which had become a center for resistance to Sassanid Persia. The religious center of the Albanian state also moved here. However, King Vache of Albania, a relative of Yazdegerd II, was forced to convert to Zoroastrianism, but soon thereafter converted back to Christianity.

According to &quot;The History of the Country of Albania&quot;, Peroz ordered the Albanian king Vache II to have the city of Perozapat (&quot;the city of Peroz&quot; or &quot;Prosperous Peroz&quot;) constructed. However, this is unlikely as the Kingdom of Caucasian Albania had been abolished by Peroz after suppressing a revolt by Vache II in the mid-460s. The city was seemingly founded by Peroz himself after the removal of the ruling family in Caucasian Albania. Due to its more secure location, it was made the new residence of the Iranian . Albania remained kingless until 485, when Vachagan III () was installed on the throne by Peroz&#x27;s brother and successor Balash (). In 552, the seat of the Albanian Catholicos was also transferred to Partaw.

By the end of the 5th century, the ancient Arsacid royal house of Albania, a branch of the ruling dynasty of Parthia, became extinct, and in the 6th century, it was replaced by princes of the Persian or Parthian Mihranid family, who claimed descent from the Sassanids. They assumed the Persian title of Arranshah (i.e. the Shah of Arran, the Persian name of Albania). The ruling dynasty was named after its Persian founder Mihran, who was a distant relative of the Sasanians. The Mihranid dynasty survived under Muslim suzerainty until 821–22.

In the late 6th to early 7th centuries the territory of Albania became an arena of wars between Sassanid Persia, Byzantium, and the Khazar Khanate, the latter two very often acting as allies against Sassanid Persia. In 628, during the Third Perso-Turkic War, the Khazars invaded Albania, and their leader Ziebel declared himself Lord of Albania, levying a tax on merchants and the fishermen of the Kura and Araxes rivers &quot;in accordance with the land survey of the kingdom of Persia&quot;. Most of Transcaucasia was under Khazar rule before the arrival of the Arabs. However, some other sources state that the Khazars later left the region because of political instability.

According to Peter Golden, &quot;steady pressure from Turkic nomads was typical of the Khazar era, although there are no unambiguous references to permanent settlements&quot;, while Vladimir Minorsky stated that, in Islamic times, &quot;the town of Qabala lying between Shirvan and Shakki was a place where Khazars were probably settled&quot;.

===Impact of Armenian politics, culture and civilization===
Armenian politics, culture and civilization played a critical role in the entire history of Caucasian Albania (Aghvank, in Armenian). This, due to the fact that after the partition of the Kingdom of Armenia by Persia and Byzantium in 387 AD, the Armenian provinces of Artsakh and Utik were disassociated from the Armenian kingdom and included by Persians into a single province (marzpanate) called Aghvank (Arran). This new unit included: the original Caucasian Albania, found between the River Kura and the Great Caucasus; tribes living along the Caspian shore; as well as Artsakh and Utik, two territories now detached from Armenia.

The Armenian medieval atlas Ashkharhatsuyts (Աշխարացույց), compiled in the 7th century by Anania Shirakatsi (Անանիա Շիրակացի, but sometimes attributed to Movses Khorenatsi as well), categorizes Artsakh and Utik as provinces of Armenia despite their presumed detachment from the Armenian Kingdom and their political association with Caucasian Albania and Persia at the time of his writing. Shirakatsi specifies that Artsakh and Utik are &quot;now detached&quot; from Armenia and included in &quot;Aghvank,&quot; and he takes care to distinguish this new entity from the old &quot;Aghvank strictly speaking&quot; (Բուն Աղվանք) situated north of the river Kura. Because it was more homogeneous and more developed than the original tribes to the north of the Kura, the Armenian element took over Caucasian Albania&#x27;s political life and was progressively able to impose its language and culture.

The Armenian population of Artsakh and Utik remained in place as did the entire political, social, cultural and military structure of the provinces. In the 5th century, early medieval historian Khorenatsi (Խորենացի) testifies that the population of Artsakh and Utik spoke Armenian, with the River Kura, in his words, marking the &quot;boundary of Armenian speech&quot; (... զեզերս հայկական խօսիցս). though this does not mean that its population consisted exclusively of ethnic Armenians.

Whatever little is known about Caucasian Albania after 387 AD comes from the Old Armenian text &quot;History of the Land of Aghvank&quot; (Պատմություն Աղվանից Աշխարհի) by the Armenian author Movses Kaghankatvatsi (also known as Movses Daskhurantsi), which in essence is the history of Armenia&#x27;s provinces of Artsakh and Utik. Kaghankatvatsi, repeating Khorenatsi, mentions that the very name &quot;Aghvank&quot;/&quot;Albania&quot; is of Armenian origin, and relates it to the Armenian word &quot;aghu&quot; (աղու, meaning &quot;kind,&quot; &quot;benevolent&quot;. Khorenatsi states that &quot;aghu&quot; was a nickname given to Prince Arran, whom the Armenian King Vologases I (Vagharsh I) appointed as governor of northeastern provinces bordering on Armenia. According to a legend reported by Khorenatsi, Arran was a descendant of Sisak, the ancestor of the Siunids of Armenia&#x27;s province of Syunik, and thus a great-grandson of the ancestral eponym of the Armenians, the Forefather Hayk. Kaghankatvatsi and another Armenian author, Kirakos Gandzaketsi, confirm Arran&#x27;s belonging to Hayk&#x27;s bloodline by calling Arranshahiks &quot;a Haykazian dynasty&quot;.

In Kaghankatvatsi&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; and in the historical text of the Armenian early medieval author Agathangelos, the Kingdom of Aghvank&#x27;s feudal system, including its political terminology, was Armenian. As in Armenia, nobles of Aghvank are referred to by the terms nakharars (նախարար), azats (ազատ), hazarapets (հազարապետ), marzpets (մարզպետ), shinakans (շինական), etc.

Princely families, which were later mentioned in Kaghankatvatsi&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; were included in the Table of Ranks called &quot;Gahnamak&quot; (direct translation: &quot;List of Thrones,&quot; Arm. Գահնամակ) of the Kingdom of Armenia, which defined Armenia&#x27;s aristocratic hierarchy. Princely families of Caucasian Albania were also included in the Table of Armies called &quot;Zoranamak&quot; (Arm. Զորանամակ) of the Kingdom of Armenia which determined military obligations of key aristocratic families before the Armenian King in times of war.

As in Armenia, the &quot;Albanian&quot; clergy used exclusively Armenian church terms for clerical hierarchy (katholikos/կաթողիկոս, vardapet/վարդապետ, sargavag/սարգավագ, etc.) Identifiably Armenian are also most if not all toponyms found in the &quot;History.&quot; Not only are the names of most towns, villages, mountains, and rivers uniquely Armenian morphologically, exactly the same toponyms were and are still found in other parts of historical Armenia. They include the root kert (&quot;town&quot;) for towns (Arm.: կերտ, such Dastakert, Hnarakert – compare with Tigranakert or modern Stapanakert in Nagorno Karabakh), shen and kan (village) for villages (Arm. շեն, and կան, such as Karashen or Dyutakan), etc.

After the partition, the capital city of Caucasian Albania was moved from the territories on the eastern bank of the River Kura (referred to by Armenians &quot;Aghvank Proper,&quot; Arm. Բուն Աղվանք) to Partav, located in the former Armenian province of Utik. This was followed by the transfer of the Seat of the Kingdom of Albania&#x27;s religious leader (Katholicos) from territories north of Kura to Partav.

The Kingdom of Albania was converted to Christianity at the start of the 4th century by none other than the Armenian evangelizer St. Gregory the Enlightener (Arm. Սբ. Գրիգոր Լուսավորիչ), who baptized Armenia into the first Christian state by 301 AD. In about 330 AD, the grandson of St. Gregory, St. Grigoris, ecumenical head of the eastern provinces of Armenia, was designated bishop for the Kingdom of Aghvank. Mausoleum interning Grigoris’ remains, the Amaras Monastery stands as the oldest dated monument in Nagorno Karabakh. Amaras was started by St. Gregory and completed by St. Grigoris himself.

According to tradition, the Amaras Monastery housed the first Armenian school in historical Armenia, which was opened early in the 5th century by the inventor of the Armenian alphabet St. Mesrob Mashtots. St. Mesrob Mashtots was intensely active in preaching Gospel in Artsakh and Utik. Movses Kaghankatvatsi&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; dedicates four separate chapters to St. Mashtots’ mission, referring to him as &quot;enlightener&quot; and &quot;saint&quot; (chapters 27, 28 and 29 of Book One, and chapter 3 of Book Two). Overall, St. Mesrob made three trips to the Kingdom of Albania where he toured not only the Armenian lands of Artsakh and Utik but also territories to the north of the River Kura.

Kaghankatvatsi&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; describes Armenian influence on the Church of Aghvank, whose jurisdiction extended from Artsakh and Utik to regions to the north of the River Kura, in the territories of the &quot;original&quot;, &quot;pre-Armenian&quot; Caucasian Albania. One of the consequences of this was that the Armenian language progressively supplanted Albanian as the language of church and state (and only if there was any single &quot;Albanian&quot; language in the first place which is doubtful because the population of Albania/Aghvank was described as consisting of as many 26 different tribes). In the same 7th century, Armenian poet Davtak Kertogh writes his &quot;Elegy on the Death of Grand Prince Juansher&quot;, where each passage begins with a letter of Armenian script in alphabetical order.

===Christianization===

The polytheistic religion of Albania was centered on the worship of three divinities, designated by &quot;Interpretatio Romana&quot; as Sol, Zeus, and Luna.

Christianity started to enter Caucasian Albania at an early date, according to Movses Kaghankatvatsi, as early as during the 1st century. The first Christian church in the region was built by St. Eliseus, a disciple of Thaddeus of Edessa, at a place called Gis. Shortly after Armenia adopted Christianity as its state religion (301 AD), the Caucasian Albanian king Urnayr went to the See of the Armenian Apostolic Church to receive baptism from St. Gregory the Illuminator, the first Patriarch of Armenia.

King Vachagan III helped to implant Christianity in Caucasian Albania, through a synod allowing the church legal rights in some domestic issues. In 498 AD (in other sources, 488 AD) in the settlement named Aluen (Aghuen) (present-day Agdam District of Azerbaijan), an Albanian church council convened to adopt laws further strengthening the position of Christianity in Albania.

Albanian churchmen took part in missionary efforts in the Caucasus and Pontic regions. In 682, the &quot;catholicos&quot;, Israel, led an unsuccessful delegation to convert Alp Iluetuer, the ruler of the North Caucasian Huns, to Christianity. The Albanian Church maintained a number of monasteries in the Holy Land. In the 7th century, Varaz-Grigor, ruler of Albania, and &quot;his nation&quot; were christened by Emperor Heraclius at Gardman.

After the overthrow of Nerses in 705, the Caucasian Albanian elite decided to reestablish the tradition of having their Catholicoi ordained through the Patriarch of Armenia, as it was the case before 590. This event is generally regarded as the abolition of the Church of Caucasian Albania, and the lowering of its denominational status to that of a Catholicate within the body of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

=== Islamic era ===
Sassanid Albania fell to the Islamic conquest of Persia in the mid-7th century and was incorporated into the Rashidun Caliphate. King Javanshir of Albania, the most prominent ruler of Mihranid dynasty, fought against the Arab invasion of caliph Uthman on the side of Sassanid Iran. Facing the threat of the Arab invasion on the south and the Khazar offensive on the north, Javanshir had to recognize the caliph&#x27;s suzerainty. The Arabs then reunited the territory with Armenia under one governor.

By the 8th century, &quot;Albania&quot; had been reduced to a strictly geographical and titular ecclesiastical connotation, and was referred to as such by medieval Armenian historians; on its place sprang a number principalities, such as that of the Armenian principality and kingdom of Khachen, along with various Caucasian, Iranian and Arabic principalities: the principality of Shaddadids, the principality of Shirvan, the principality of Derbent. Most of the region was ruled by the Persian Sajid dynasty from 890 to 929. The region was at times part of the Abbasid province of Armenia based on numismatic and historical evidence.

Early Muslim ruling dynasties of the time included Rawadids, Sajids, Salarids, Shaddadids, Shirvanshahs, and the Sheki and Tiflis emirates. The principal cities of Arran in early medieval times were Barda (Partav) and Ganja. Barda reached prominence in the 10th century, and was used to house a mint. Barda was sacked by the Rus and Norse several times in the 10th century as a result of the Caspian expeditions of the Rus. Barda never revived after these raids and was replaced as capital by Baylaqan, which in turn was sacked by the Mongols in 1221. After this Ganja rose to prominence and became the central city of the region. The capital of the Shaddadid dynasty, Ganja was considered the &quot;mother city of Arran&quot; during their reign.

The territory of Arran became a part of the Seljuk empire, followed by the Ildegizid state. It was taken briefly by the Khwarizmid dynasty and then overran by Mongol Hulagu empire in the 13th century. Later, it became a part of Chobanid, Jalayirid, Timurid, and Safavid states.

==In Azerbaijani historiography==

The history of Caucasian Albania has been a major topic of Azerbaijani revisionist theories, which came under criticism in Western and Russian academic and analytical circles, and were often characterized as &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;futile&quot;.

In his article &quot;The Albanian Myth&quot;, Russian historian and anthropologist Victor Schnirelmann states that Azerbaijani academics have been &quot;renaming prominent medieval Armenian political leaders, historians and writers, who lived in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia into &quot;Albanians&quot;&quot;. Schnirelmann argues that these efforts were first launched in the 1950s and were directed towards &quot;ripping the population of early medieval Nagorno Karabakh off from their Armenian heritage&quot; and &quot;cleansing Azerbaijan of Armenian history&quot;. In the 1970s, Azerbaijan made a transition from ignoring, discounting or concealing Armenian historical heritage in Soviet Azerbaijan to misattributing and mischaracterizing it as examples of Azerbaijani culture by arbitrarily declaring &quot;Caucasian Albanians&quot; as ancestors of modern Azerbaijanis. In this regard, Thomas de Waal, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, writes about the political context of Azerbaijan&#x27;s historical revisionism:
This rather bizarre argument has the strong political subtext that Nagorno Karabakh had in fact been Caucasian Albanian and that Armenians had no claim to it.
Schnirelmann states that a significant revisionist method used by Azerbaijani scholars was &quot;re-publishing of ancient and medieval sources, where the term &quot;Armenian state&quot; was routinely and systematically removed and replaced with &quot;Albanian state&quot;. American author George Bournoutian gives examples of how that was done by Ziya Bunyadov, vice-chairman of Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences, who earned the nickname of &quot;Azerbaijan’s foremost Armenophobe&quot;.

According to de Waal:

Buniatov’s scholarly credentials were dubious. It later transpired that the two articles he published in 1960 and 1965 on Caucasian Albania were direct plagiarism. Under his own name, he had simply published, unattributed, translations of two articles, originally written in English by Western scholars C.F.J. Dowsett and Robert Hewsen.
Hewsen, a historian from Rowan College and the acknowledged authority in this field, wrote in his volume &quot;Armenia: A Historical Atlas&quot;, published by University of Chicago Press:

According to de Waal, a disciple of Bunyadov, Farida Mammadova, has &quot;taken the Albanian theory and used it to push Armenians out of the Caucasus altogether. She had relocated Caucasian Albania into what is now the Republic of Armenia. All those lands, churches, and monasteries in the Republic of Armenia—all had been Albanian. No sacred Armenian fact was left un-attacked&quot;. De Waal describes Mammadova as a sophisticated end of what &quot;in Azerbaijan has become a very blunt instrument indeed&quot;. Both Ziya Bunyadov and Farida Mammadova are known for their anti-Armenian public pronouncements and pamphlets.

Historical revisionism in Azerbaijan supported a number of policies on the ground, including cultural vandalism directed against Armenian monuments in Soviet and post-Soviet Azerbaijan. Armenian memorial stone crosses known as &quot;&quot;khachkars&quot; on the territory of Azerbaijan were regularly misrepresented as &quot;Caucasian Albanian&quot; both before and after Azerbaijan&#x27;s independence. Furthermore, mischaracterization of Armenian &quot;khachkars&quot; as supposedly non-Armenian monuments of Caucasian Albania was associated with acts of cultural vandalism against Armenian historical monuments in Nakhichevan. The Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan refer to the systematic campaign by the government of Azerbaijan to completely demolish the Armenian cemetery in Julfa with thousands of Armenian &quot;khachkars&quot; near the town of Julfa (known as Jugha in Armenian), Nakhchivan. Claims by Armenians that Azerbaijan was undertaking a systematic campaign to destroy and remove the monuments first arose in late 1998 and those charges were renewed in 2002 and 2005. Adam T. Smith, an anthropologist and associate professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago, called the removal of the khachkars &quot;a shameful episode in humanity&#x27;s relation to its past, a deplorable act on the part of the government of Azerbaijan which requires both explanation and repair&quot;. Smith and other scholars, as well as several United States Senators, signed a letter to the UNESCO and other organizations condemning Azerbaijan&#x27;s government. Azerbaijan instead contends that the monuments were not of Armenian, but of Caucasian Albanian, origin, which, per Thomas De Waal, did not protect &quot;the graveyard from an act in the history wars&quot;.

Anti-Armenian cultural vandalism in Azerbaijan perpetrated with the use of revisionist theories on Caucasian Albania was also noted in northern Azerbaijan, where Norwegian archeologists were involved in the restoration of an Armenian-Georgian church in the village of Kish near the city of Shaki. Azerbaijanis erased Armenian inscriptions on the church&#x27;s walls, which led to by an official complaint by Norwegian foreign ministry.

Furthermore, revisionist theories about Caucasian Albania have also been used by Azerbaijani statesmen in the ongoing Azerbaijani-Georgian dispute over the territorial status of David Gareja monastery complex, a Georgian spiritual and historical monument partially located on the territory of Azerbaijani Republic. David Gareja is a rock-hewn Georgian Orthodox monastery complex in the Kakheti region of Eastern Georgia, on the semi-desert slopes of Mount Gareja, some 60–70 km southeast of Georgia&#x27;s capital Tbilisi. Giorgi Manjgaladze, Georgia&#x27;s deputy foreign minister proposed that Georgia would be willing to exchange other territory for the remainder of David Gareja because of its historical and cultural significance to the Georgians. Baku disapproves of this land swap, and in April 2007, Azerbaijan&#x27;s deputy foreign minister Khalaf Khalafov told a press conference in Baku that it was &quot;out of the question&quot; for Azerbaijan to &quot;give up its claims to the borderlands&quot; including David Gareja. Khalafov then stated that the monastery &quot;was home to the Caucasian Albanians, who are believed to have been the earliest inhabitants of Azerbaijan&quot;. Georgian art historian Dimitri Tumanishvili dismissed this claim and stated that the complex &quot;is covered in the work of Georgian masters&quot;. &quot;There are Georgian inscriptions everywhere dating back to the sixth century,&quot; he said, &quot;There are no traces of another culture there. After that, I don’t think you need any further proof.&quot;
