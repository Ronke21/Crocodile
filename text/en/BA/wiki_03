<text>Charmed is an American fantasy drama television series created by Constance M. Burge and produced by Aaron Spelling and his production company Spelling Television, with Brad Kern serving as showrunner. The series was originally broadcast by The WB from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006. The series narrative follows a trio of sisters, known as The Charmed Ones, the most-powerful, good witches of all time, who use their combined &quot;Power of Three&quot; to protect innocent lives from evil beings such as demons and warlocks. Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, while they attempt to maintain normal lives in modern-day San Francisco. Keeping their supernatural identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives often becomes a challenge for them, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on their various relationships and resulting in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series. The series initially focuses on the three Halliwell sisters, Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs), and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano).

&quot;Charmed&quot; achieved a cult following and popularity on The WB with its first episode &quot;Something Wicca This Way Comes&quot; garnering 7.7 million viewers, breaking the record for the network&#x27;s highest-rated debut episode. The show&#x27;s ratings, although smaller than rival shows on the &quot;big four&quot; networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB network. &quot;Charmed&quot; went through several timeslot changes during its eight-season run. During its fifth season, the show moved to the Sunday 8:00 pm timeslot, where it became the highest-rated Sunday night program in The WB&#x27;s history. At 178 episodes, &quot;Charmed&quot; was the second-longest drama broadcast by The WB, behind &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. In 2006, it became the longest-running, hour-long television series featuring all-female leads, before being surpassed by &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; in 2012.

The series has also received numerous awards and nominations. In 2010, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and AOL TV ranked &quot;Charmed&quot; within their joint list of &quot;The Top 20 Magic/Supernatural Shows of All Time,&quot; while in 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed the series as one of &quot;The 60 Greatest Sci-Fi Shows of All Time.&quot; &quot;Charmed&quot; has also become a source of pop culture references in film and television and has influenced other succeeding television series in the same subgenre. The show&#x27;s success has led to its development in other media, including a video game, board games, soundtracks, novels, and a comic book series which served as a continuation of its narrative. According to data research from The NPD Group in 2012, &quot;Charmed&quot; was the second-most binge watched television series on subscription video-on-demand services, such as Netflix. A reboot series of &quot;Charmed&quot;, featuring different cast members and characters, premiered on The CW on October 14, 2018.

== Series overview ==
The series starts in 1998 when Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano) returns from New York and moves back into the family&#x27;s Halliwell Manor in San Francisco to live with her sisters Prue (Shannen Doherty) and Piper (Holly Marie Combs). When Phoebe discovers the family&#x27;s &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; in the attic, she learns that she and her sisters are the most powerful witches ever known, destined to protect both innocents and the world at large from demons, warlocks, and other evil creatures. Phoebe, reasonably suspecting the book to be a novelty, reads its initial inscription—unaware that it also happens to be an incantation activating the sisters&#x27; supernatural powers once all three are reunited in their ancestral home.

By the end of the first episode, each sister learns that she has a unique magical power that allows them to cast spells and brew potions. Prue, the eldest, has the power of telekinesis (the ability to move objects with her mind), and in season two she develops the power of astral projection (the ability to be in two places at once). Piper, the middle sister, has the power of molecular immobilization. As she grows more proficient, she learns how to freeze only certain people or objects or body parts, as she wishes. In season three, her powers evolve further, as she is able to cause evil beings or objects to explode using her hands as a development of her powers surrounding molecular movement. Phoebe, the youngest of the three, initially possesses the power of premonition allowing her to receive visions of the future and later of the past. She later develops the powers of levitation in season three, and empathy in season six, the latter allowing her to sense and tap into others&#x27; emotions and, sometimes, powers. In accordance with the series&#x27; mythology, witches&#x27; powers are tied to their emotions.

During the first two seasons, the sisters face various evil beings from week to week. However, in the third season, they discover that their ultimate enemy is The Underworld&#x27;s demonic ruler, The Source of All Evil. Eventually, Prue is killed in the season three finale by The Source&#x27;s personal assassin, Shax (Michael Bailey Smith). While grieving for their older sister, Piper and Phoebe discover that they also have a younger half-sister, Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan), who had been the secret love child of their witch mother, Patty (Finola Hughes), and her &quot;whitelighter&quot; (guardian angel) Sam Wilder (Scott Jaeck). Paige&#x27;s magical abilities represent her dual heritage as both a witch and whitelighter; like Prue, she possesses a form of telekinesis, but she has to verbally call for objects to &quot;orb&quot; (teleport) them to their intended destination. As she attempts to control the two sides of her ancestry, Paige also learns how to orb herself and others, and to heal others with the touch of her hand; she eventually receives her own whitelighter charges to train and protect as they learn witchcraft. Paige can also &quot;glamour&quot;, shapeshifting into a different human appearance.

The Source, responsible for the majority of attacks on the sisters, becomes the main villain during season four until he is finally vanquished. After his demise, an annual season-long storyline and several antagonists are introduced in subsequent seasons (occasionally following the &quot;Big Bad&quot; television format). These include Phoebe&#x27;s demonic ex-husband, Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), until mid-season five; the scheming, misguided Elder, Gideon (Gildart Jackson), throughout season six; The Avatars until mid-season seven; the demon Zankou (Oded Fehr) until the season seven finale; and, in season eight, powerful sister witches Billie (Kaley Cuoco) and Christy Jenkins (Marnette Patterson), who fall under the influence of the demonic Triad (who earlier feature as an early-season three antagonist). In addition to the supernatural themes explored in &quot;Charmed&quot;, the characters contend with serious issues in their day-to-day lives such as relationships, careers, marriage, childbirth, illness and the deaths of loved ones. The sisters also fight to prevent the exposure of the existence of magic to the human community at large, contending with several police, FBI, and Homeland Security investigations. Often through the assistance of their long-term ally, Darryl Morris (Dorian Gregory) of the San Francisco Police Department, they are able to avoid police suspicion, including the investigation of the most-recurring human antagonist, Inspector Sheridan (Jenya Lano), in the sixth and seventh seasons.

The sisters also face romantic storylines. Prue&#x27;s love interests include her high school sweetheart, Inspector Andy Trudeau (Ted King), who dies in the season one finale in an attempt to save the sisters, and a brief co-worker, Jack Sheridan (Lochlyn Munro), in season two. Piper&#x27;s central love interest throughout the series is the sisters&#x27; whitelighter Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause); their early relationship is problematic due to the forbidden nature of witch-whitelighter relationships, and so in season two a love triangle forms with Piper, Leo and her neighbor, Dan Gordon (Greg Vaughan). Eventually, the two manage to marry and consummate their union in season three, producing a son named Wyatt in season five. The couple separate due to supernatural circumstances at the end of the fifth season; however, they reconnect in the subsequent season, resulting in a second son named Chris. The final episode of &quot;Charmed&quot; shows them to have a daughter, many grandchildren, and to grow old together in the future. Phoebe&#x27;s romantic history involves a tortured relationship with half-demon, half-human Cole Turner in the show&#x27;s third, fourth and fifth seasons; they have a turbulent marriage in the fourth, and in the fifth, following their divorce, she is compelled to vanquish him. Phoebe has a number of multi-episode human boyfriends in subsequent seasons, including her boss, Jason Dean (Eric Dane), before meeting a cupid named Coop (Victor Webster) in the eighth season, whom she marries. Paige, like Phoebe, has several multi-episode boyfriends, including fellow-witch and magic &quot;addict&quot; Richard Montana (Balthazar Getty) in season six, and an unstable FBI agent-turned-whitelighter Kyle Brody (Kerr Smith) in season seven. In the eighth season, she becomes committed to a human parole officer, Henry Mitchell (Ivan Sergei), whom she marries. The final episode&#x27;s flashforward montage reveals Piper, Phoebe, and Paige to have three children each with their respective husbands.

== Cast and characters ==

As the series progresses, Prue learns how to channel her telekinetic powers through her hands and gains the power of astral projection, the ability to be in two places at once. The evolution of her powers was explained by the theory that her ability to move objects with her mind evolved into the ability to move or transfer her own consciousness and astral body to other places. Prue also develops martial arts skills and becomes an effective hand-to-hand fighter. During her three seasons on &quot;Charmed&quot;, she is regarded as the strongest and most powerful witch of the Halliwell sisters. Prue initially works as an appraiser for an auction house, and later becomes a professional photographer for a magazine company.

* Holly Marie Combs as Piper Halliwell, the second-eldest sister who initially receives the power to freeze demons, people, and objects; and eventually her surrounding environment.

She was given up at birth and raised by her adoptive parents. Paige is introduced upon Prue&#x27;s funeral at the beginning of season four, where she goes on to help reconstitute The Charmed Ones by taking Prue&#x27;s place in the &quot;Power of Three&quot;.

==Production==

===Development===
In 1998, when The WB began looking for a new drama series for the 1998–99 season, they approached Spelling Television (which had produced the network&#x27;s then-most successful series, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;) to create it. Expanding on the popularity of witch-themed dramas such as &quot;The Craft&quot; (1996) and &quot;Practical Magic&quot; (1998), the production company explored different forms of mythology to find characters they could realize with contemporary storytelling.

Constance M. Burge was hired to create the series as she was under contract with 20th Century Fox and Spelling Television after conceiving the drama series &quot;Savannah&quot; (1996–97). When the theme of witchcraft was first pitched to her, she was aware of stereotypes of witches (flying brooms, black cats, and warts). After researching Wicca, she changed her perspective and aimed at telling a story of good witches who looked and acted like ordinary people. With this, her initial concept was a series set in Boston, Massachusetts, about three friends and roommates who were all witches. However, executive producer E. Duke Vincent lacked confidence, asking &quot;Why would anybody want to watch a show about three witches?&quot; He proposed that the series should focus on family values and developed the series-long mantra of it being about &quot;three sisters who happen to be witches, not three witches who happen to be sisters.&quot; Spelling warmed to Burge&#x27;s ideas and, after the concept was re-crafted to be a series about three sisters (now living in San Francisco) descended from a line of witches, it was pitched to The WB&#x27;s President of Entertainment, Susanne Daniels, who liked it, allowing the series to begin development.

The series was retitled &quot;Charmed&quot; after Spelling&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;House of Sisters&quot; was dropped. Burge wrote the pilot script and a 28-minute version of the pilot was filmed, which was never aired on network television. After original cast member Lori Rom quit the series before its premiere, Alyssa Milano took over her role and a new pilot had to be filmed. Upon its debut, &quot;Charmed&quot; received the largest audience for a series premiere in The WB&#x27;s history. The first season of 22 episodes was picked up by The WB after only two episodes had aired.

===Casting===
Former &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; actress Shannen Doherty was cast as the eldest sister Prue Halliwell, while her best friend at the time and former &quot;Picket Fences&quot; actress Holly Marie Combs played the role of the middle sister Piper Halliwell. Lori Rom was originally cast as the youngest sister Phoebe Halliwell in the 28-minute unaired pilot episode. However, Rom quit the series, and a new pilot was filmed with former &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; actress Alyssa Milano in the role of Phoebe. Doherty departed &quot;Charmed&quot; at the end of the third season. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Tiffani Thiessen were both considered as replacements. The part ultimately went to film actress Rose McGowan, who played the long-lost younger half-sister Paige Matthews in the fourth season.

In season one, Ted King was cast as the inspector Andy Trudeau, Dorian Gregory was cast as his inspector partner Darryl Morris, and Brian Krause was cast as the Halliwell sisters&#x27; whitelighter Leo Wyatt. King departed &quot;Charmed&quot; at the end of the first season, while Gregory remained on the show until the seventh season. In season two, Greg Vaughan joined the series as the Halliwell sisters&#x27; new next-door neighbor Dan Gordon, while Karis Paige Bryant was cast as his niece Jenny Gordon. Bryant left her role midway through the second season, while Vaughan left at the end of the season. Australian actor Julian McMahon joined the cast of &quot;Charmed&quot; in season three as the half-demon Cole Turner. He departed the show midway through season five. Drew Fuller joined &quot;Charmed&quot; at the end of the fifth season as Piper and Leo&#x27;s second son from the future, Chris Halliwell. Fuller left his role at the end of season six, but returned for guest appearances in later seasons. In the eighth and final season, Kaley Cuoco joined the show as the young witch Billie Jenkins.

===Production and writing===
Aaron Spelling and E. Duke Vincent maintained their positions as executive producers of the series until it ended. Constance M. Burge became an executive producer when she was hired to create the series and write the pilot script. After the 28-minute &quot;unaired pilot&quot; was shown to The WB and the series was picked up by the network, Brad Kern was recruited as the fourth executive producer and as the showrunner in order to decipher how the series would develop over the course of its run. Scripting was done by a large number of writers. Kern did the most writing, with a total of 26 episodes, as well as directing one of them. The writers with the most writing credits other than Kern include Daniel Cerone, Curtis Kheel, Zack Estrin, Chris Levinson, Krista Vernoff, Sheryl J. Anderson, Monica Owusu-Breen, Alison Schapker, Cameron Litvack, and Jeannine Renshaw. Burge wrote seven episodes for the first and second seasons before leaving her position as executive producer. Scripting was carried out after group brainstorms took place, discussing the events of the episodes, the emotions of the characters, and the mythology involved. Robert Masello, an executive story editor for the series, credits himself as the only demonologist hired for a series, in order to add his experience to the storyline.

The book &quot;Investigating Charmed: The Magic Power of TV&quot; (2007) revealed that viewers of the Wiccan religion appreciated the accurate portrayal of some Wiccan elements, but were disappointed with the way the series tied the Wiccan religion with Christianity, through the concept of demons and angels (Whitelighters). One Wiccan viewer noted that some of the evil demons in &quot;Charmed&quot; carry the names of benevolent gods and goddesses in the Wiccan religion. However, many Wiccan viewers appreciated the fact that &quot;Charmed&quot; brought their religion into the public eye in a positive way, through the use of other elements such as sacred objects, spellcasting, a &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;, solstice celebrations and handfastings. Cast member Holly Marie Combs revealed in &quot;The Women of Charmed&quot; documentary (2000) that the series aimed at following a mythology created by fantasy, and not adhering to Wiccan rules too closely, for fear of coming under criticism for either not being &quot;technically correct enough&quot; or missing the truth completely.

Ahead of the third season, Burge left her former position as executive producer to Kern, after she reportedly became frustrated that storylines for the third season were going to become more focused on the sisters&#x27; relationships with their love interests than each other. She had disagreements with Kern over bringing the character Cole Turner (Julian McMahon) into the show as a love interest for Alyssa Milano&#x27;s character Phoebe, as there was already enough focus on the show&#x27;s established couple Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause). However, Burge remained on &quot;Charmed&quot; as a creative consultant until season four. Her departure resulted in changes in the story structure of the show, from a &quot;demon of the week&quot; system to using third or half-season-long story arcs. In addition, more importance was given to the protagonists&#x27; personal lives. The serial connection of episodes culminated in the second half of season four. Despite the ratings increasing during season four&#x27;s final story arc from 4.19 to 4.21, The WB asked Kern to abandon the serial system. This led to the largely episodic structure of season five, and resulted in the two systems being balanced from the sixth season onwards.

===Filming locations===
The first six seasons of &quot;Charmed&quot; were filmed at Ray-Art Studios in Canoga Park, Los Angeles on four of the studio&#x27;s sound stages. After Ray-Arts Studio was sold in 2003, production for &quot;Charmed&quot; moved to the Paramount Studios lot for seasons seven and eight. The Innes House located at 1329 Carroll Avenue in Los Angeles was used as the exterior for the show&#x27;s fictional Halliwell Manor, and has become popular with tourists over the years.

=== Budget cuts ===
During the seventh season and for the first time in its history, the show had been in limbo as there was no guaranteed renewal for an eighth season. &quot;Charmed&quot; was ultimately renewed for a final season, but the budget was cut considerably compared to previous seasons due to expensive special effects and props and highly-paid actresses. Executive producer Brad Kern revealed that they had to cut back on special effects and guest stars, and that the entire season was shot only on the Paramount Studios lot as they could not go out on location anymore. These budget cuts also led to cast member Dorian Gregory being written out of the final season and Brian Krause being written out of several episodes as a cost-saving measure. Kern revealed that the show could not afford to have Krause in all 22 episodes of the final season, but he was brought back for the final two episodes to help bring closure to the storylines.

===Opening sequence===
&quot;Charmed&quot; uses its opening sequence to introduce the main and supporting cast members in each season. It consists of scenes from various episodes and miscellaneous footage of the cast which was updated from season to season. The opening begins with images of the Golden Gate Bridge and flashing shots of the triquetra symbol in a circle. The show&#x27;s title card then appears, featuring the triquetra symbol and &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;. After the title card in the opening of seasons 1 to 3, scenes from the pilot episode are shown, including an overhead view of the sisters casting a spell at a round table and a shot of them coming downstairs. A scene of the sisters reciting a spell is then shown with the word &quot;Starring.&quot; This is followed by clips of each main and supporting cast member, though the supporting cast is omitted from the first five episodes, in which Milano was the last to be billed. The last few scenes in the opening show the sisters&#x27; cat, a San Francisco cable car, and lastly the sisters walking upstairs into their home, with Doherty&#x27;s character closing the door using her telekinetic powers.

Following Doherty&#x27;s departure at the end of season three, the season four opening credits had to be recreated to remove all footage of Doherty and to include her replacement, Rose McGowan. The beginning of the opening remained the same. However, after the title card is shown, new scenes are introduced which include images of the Golden Gate Bridge, a gargoyle, talisman, a scrying crystal, a tattoo of the triquetra symbol, and candles. The order in which the lead actresses are credited was also changed to accommodate the changes to the main cast. The last few scenes in the opening are also changed to include a cemetery, exterior shots of the Halliwell Manor, and pages in the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;. A five-second opening was used for the two-part premiere episodes of seasons four and five; it features flashing shots of the triquetra symbol and the show&#x27;s title in large blue letters.

The opening theme song used in the original television airings of all eight seasons was Love Spit Love&#x27;s cover version of &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; by The Smiths. This version of the song had previously appeared on the soundtrack of &quot;The Craft&quot;, and is featured in the series&#x27; first soundtrack album. In the shortened five-second opening for the two-part premiere episodes of seasons four and five, the song was replaced by instrumental music. &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; was also replaced by hard rock instrumental music in the season eight DVD because the license to use the song had expired. This hard rock instrumental music was also used in the opening of all eight seasons on Netflix and later on Peacock.

For its remaster, although most of the original shots for the opening credits were retained, some background images and flashing symbols were panned and scanned to fit the 16:9 aspect ratio.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===

The earlier seasons of &quot;Charmed&quot; received mostly favorable reviews from television critics, with its first season scoring a Metacritic score of 61 out of 100. During the first season, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Ken Tucker, speaking on the comparisons between &quot;Charmed&quot; and rival series, argued: &quot;spike-heeled where &quot;Buffy&quot; is fleet-footed, &quot;Charmed&quot; is &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; with an Ouija board.&quot; As well as the show&#x27;s action sequences—describing the Halliwells as &quot;superheroes&quot;—he noted that the series &quot;plays up the stars&#x27; separate-but-equal charms&quot; and admired both its &quot;casting and pop-culture timing.&quot; Vanessa Thorpe of &quot;The Guardian&quot; agreed with Alyssa Milano&#x27;s description of &quot;Charmed&quot; as &quot;perfect post-feminist girl-power,&quot; praising the balance between action and emotion as the &quot;three sibling sorceresses know mischief, but are accessibly feminine.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Karyn L. Barr labelled &quot;Charmed&quot; a &quot;crafty cult classic&quot; and in her retrospective review of the first season, wrote that it &quot;remains spellbinding thanks to its proper balance of quirky humor, &quot;Buffy&quot;-esque drama&quot; and Shannen Doherty&#x27;s character Prue. Angelica Bastien of &quot;Bustle&quot; magazine commended the &quot;strong female characters&quot; and felt that the show resembled &quot;&quot; more than &quot;Buffy&quot; due to its &quot;mix of drama, wacky humor, intensely layered mythology, and feminism-lite vibe.&quot;

During the third season, Michael Abernethy of &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised the &quot;well-choreographed action sequences, respectable acting&quot; and &quot;believable&quot; sisterly relationship between Milano, Doherty, and Holly Marie Combs. Abernethy credited &quot;Charmed&quot; as &quot;more enjoyable than most shows in the good vs evil genre&quot; largely due to the strength of the performers, and noted that despite the monster of the week format, &quot;the writers tend to explore the sibling dynamics to keep the show from growing redundant.&quot; Christel Loar also from &quot;PopMatters&quot; agreed that &quot;episodes go beyond the demon-of-the-week formula to tap into the relationships of the characters and their...flaws. &quot;Charmed&quot;...succeeded by combining sisterhood with the supernatural.&quot; Loar also claimed that the Halliwells&#x27; struggle for normal lives, &quot;stability, and a sense of self is one of the reasons &quot;Charmed&quot; strikes such a chord with its viewers.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya described the fourth season as &quot;one of the grimmest seasons of &quot;Charmed&quot;,&quot; following Doherty&#x27;s departure and her character&#x27;s death &quot;informing the overall tone.&quot; Upadhyaya also praised the &quot;smart decisions&quot; the writers made of how they introduced a new sister into the series, calling the transition &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot;″s greatest accomplishment&quot; that &quot;opened up whole new avenues for grounded, emotional storytelling.&quot; During the sixth season, Gillian Flynn of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described &quot;Charmed&quot; as &quot;a guilty-pleasure fantasy&quot; that is &quot;inherently cute and incredibly simple.&quot; Flynn also praised the comedic acting between Milano, Combs and Rose McGowan, adding that &quot;selling this kind of comedy takes a certain gameness, and the actresses have got it.&quot;

The later seasons of &quot;Charmed&quot; also received a mixed reception from some critics. &quot;Bustle&quot;″s Bastien felt that after Doherty&#x27;s departure, &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot; got pretty bad,&quot; noting that the show &quot;lost track of its core theme&quot; of witchcraft and sisterhood by bringing in mystical fairy tale beings and focusing more on soap opera-type plots and the sisters&#x27; love lives. Similarly, BuzzFeed writer Jarett Wieselman agreed that &quot;After Doherty&#x27;s exit, &quot;Charmed&quot; veered into slightly-absurd-yet-no-less-entertaining territory,&quot; noting that McGowan&#x27;s addition &quot;ushered in a wave of increasingly campy episodes.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Upadhyaya felt that the latter seasons &quot;got too complicated&quot; and campy by focusing too much on the magic &quot;and not enough about the themes that grounded the show earlier on.&quot; Becca James also from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that the show &quot;should have died the same time&quot; Doherty&#x27;s character did. Hugh Armitage of Digital Spy believed that &quot;Charmed&quot; &quot;began to feel very self-indulgent towards its stars&quot; in the later seasons, noting that character-driven storylines were replaced with gimmicks, such as the revealing outfits worn by the sisters, particularly both Milano&#x27;s and McGowan&#x27;s characters. &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; magazine&#x27;s Kristina Adams felt that, after creator Constance M. Burge&#x27;s departure from the show, executive producer Brad Kern &quot;ruined it&quot; by focusing more on the magic and making a &quot;cliché&quot; magical world with the introduction of nymphs, Greek gods, valkyries, Egyptian gods, magic school, gnomes, and ogres. Adams further added that &quot;storylines were less thought out,&quot; and the sisters&#x27; outfits were becoming &quot;more and more revealing.&quot; Nick Romano of Screen Crush wrote that &quot;the storylines became wicca ridiculous and the dialogue became too cheesy,&quot; particularly in season eight. Jon Langmead of &quot;PopMatters&quot; believed that &quot;Charmed&quot; &quot;slipped markedly&quot; in seasons seven and eight, noting that the final season lost appealing elements such as &quot;smart casting&quot; and &quot;attention to relationship drama&quot; of the show&#x27;s earlier seasons. Langmead also disliked the introduction of Kaley Cuoco and Marnette Patterson in the eighth season, and felt that Cuoco was &quot;consistently painful to watch.&quot; DVD Verdict&#x27;s Ryan Keefer also felt that Cuoco joining the show was a &quot;poor choice&quot; by the producers, and commented that season eight &quot;failed to recapture the glory days of the first few seasons.&quot;

=== Awards and nominations ===
&quot;Charmed&quot; has gathered several awards and nominations. The show was nominated for one TV Guide Award, two International Horror Guild Awards, three Teen Choice Awards, three Wand Awards and seven RATTY Awards, with Holly Marie Combs winning &quot;Best Science Fiction Lead Actress&quot; in 2003. It was also nominated for three Saturn Awards, including one &quot;Best Network Television Series&quot; nomination for its first season and two &quot;Best Actress on Television&quot; nominations for Shannen Doherty in 1999 and 2000. In 2001, &quot;Charmed&quot; won a Cable Guide Award in the United Kingdom for &quot;Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Series.&quot; The series also won a &quot;Certificate of Merit&quot; at the 2003 EDGE Awards for the season four episode &quot;Muse to My Ears.&quot;

In 2004, Alyssa Milano was nominated for a Spacey Award in Canada for &quot;Favorite Female TV Character&quot; and in 2005, she was nominated for &quot;Favorite Television Actress&quot; at the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. That same year, Rose McGowan won the award for &quot;Favorite Sister&quot; at the Family Television Awards. &quot;Charmed&quot; also received recognition for its young guest actors, having been nominated for five Young Artist Awards, with Alex Black winning once for his role in the season four episode &quot;Lost and Bound.&quot;

== Broadcasting and viewership ==

In the United States, &quot;Charmed&quot; premiered on The WB on October 7, 1998, and ended on May 21, 2006. The first season aired on Wednesday nights at 9:00 pm. For its second, third and fourth seasons, &quot;Charmed&quot; moved to Thursday nights. For the fifth season, the series moved to Sunday nights at 8:00 pm and remained there until its eighth and final season. By the end of season eight, &quot;Charmed&quot; had aired a total of 178 episodes and became the longest running hour-long television series in American history, featuring all female leads. Most seasons consisted of 22 episodes, except for the fifth and sixth seasons, which contained 23 episodes, including their double-episode premieres and double-episode finales.

TNT and E! currently air reruns of &quot;Charmed&quot; during early weekday mornings. Full episodes of &quot;Charmed&quot; are also available for viewing on TNT&#x27;s official website. WE tv had previously aired reruns during weeknights in 2010. The series was first released onto the subscription video-on-demand service Netflix in July 2011. According to data research from The NPD Group, &quot;Charmed&quot; was the second-most binge watched television series on subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix in 2012.

===Ratings===

&quot;Charmed&quot;″s first episode &quot;Something Wicca This Way Comes&quot; broke the record for the highest-rated debut episode for The WB, with 7.72 million viewers. The show&#x27;s ratings, although smaller than rival shows on the &quot;big four&quot; networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB network. &quot;Charmed&quot;″s premiere in 1998 helped ratings rise for The WB, with &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Mark Schwed noting that the network&#x27;s viewing figures were way up than the previous year. For its first three seasons, &quot;Charmed&quot; was the second-highest rated series on The WB, behind &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. During its fifth season, the series became the highest-rated Sunday night program in The WB&#x27;s history.

== Cultural impact ==

=== Television ===
&quot;Charmed&quot; was the first primetime television show about a coven of witches. Following the broadcast of the season eight episode &quot;Payback&#x27;s a Witch&quot; in January 2006, &quot;Charmed&quot; became the longest running hour-long series in American television history featuring all female leads. However, this accolade was surpassed in 2012 by &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, which also lasted for eight seasons but aired two more episodes than &quot;Charmed&quot;. In 2000, Cult TV placed &quot;Charmed&quot; at number forty-four on its list of the &quot;Top 100 Cult TV Shows.&quot; In 2007, AOL TV ranked each Charmed One on its list of the &quot;Top TV Witches&quot;—Piper third, Phoebe seventh, Prue ninth and Paige twelfth. In 2010, HuffPost TV and AOL TV ranked &quot;Charmed&quot; at number ten on their joint list of &quot;The Top 20 Magic/Supernatural Shows of All Time&quot; and in 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; placed the series on its list of &quot;The 60 Greatest Sci-Fi Shows of All Time.&quot;

In 2012, six years after its original broadcasting, &quot;Charmed&quot; was found by The NPD Group to be the second-most binge watched television series on subscription video-on-demand services, such as Netflix. After &quot;Charmed&quot; ended, there were never any other long-running shows about witches to rival shows about vampires and zombies. In 2013, Joe Rhodes of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to &quot;Charmed&quot; as &quot;the last successful witch TV series,&quot; while BuzzFeed writer Jarett Wieselman wrote that &quot;no subsequent [witch] series have been able to replicate &quot;Charmed&quot;″s success.&quot; Many witch-themed shows since &quot;Charmed&quot; ended have been cancelled after one or two seasons. The 2013–14 season saw a resurgence of witches in new shows &quot;The Originals&quot;, &quot;Witches of East End&quot;, &quot;Salem&quot;, and in the third season of &quot;American Horror Story&quot; titled &quot;Coven&quot;. In an interview with E! Online, cast member Alyssa Milano stated that she believed the success of &quot;Charmed&quot; helped pave the way for these witch-themed shows, saying &quot;I feel like networks are trying to replicate that.&quot; The growing trend of witches on television that year as well as &quot;Charmed&quot;″s success on Netflix prompted CBS to develop a reboot of &quot;Charmed&quot;, which did not get picked up at the network. However, The CW network later developed a different reboot series, which premiered in October 2018, featuring different cast members and characters.

&quot;Witches of East End&quot; (2013–14) was noted by critics for its strong resemblance to &quot;Charmed&quot;, as both shows are about a sisterhood of witches battling evil and live in similar houses, which its executive producer Maggie Friedman has acknowledged. Other witch-themed shows that have been compared to &quot;Charmed&quot; include &quot;The Secret Circle&quot; (2011–12) and &quot;Hex&quot; (2004–05), which was described as &quot;the U.K.&#x27;s edgier, oversexed response to &quot;Charmed&quot;.&quot; &quot;Eastwick&quot; (2009) was noted for its surface similarities to &quot;Charmed&quot; as it also focused on a trio of female witches, which led director David Nutter to come out and say that &quot;Eastwick&quot; was not a clone of &quot;Charmed&quot;. The season four episode of &quot;Smallville&quot; titled &quot;Spell&quot; also received comparisons to &quot;Charmed&quot; as it focused on three of its main female characters, who get possessed by a trio of 16th Century witches.

=== &quot;Charmed&quot; in popular culture ===
The depiction of witchcraft in &quot;Charmed&quot; has had a significant impact on popular culture. The book &quot;Investigating Charmed: The Magic Power of TV&quot; (2007) revealed that viewers of the Wiccan religion appreciated the fact that &quot;Charmed&quot; brought their religion into the public eye in a positive way, through the use of sacred objects, spellcasting, a &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;, solstice celebrations and handfastings. In 2008, the religious organisation Beliefnet ranked The Charmed Ones at number eight on their list of the &quot;Top 10 Witches in Pop Culture.&quot; Beliefnet praised the cultural image of &quot;Charmed&quot; for its female empowerment, mythology and how the sisters &quot;managed to solve their cases&quot; week-on-week. In 2011, &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine named The Charmed Ones ninth in its list of the top fictional witches of all time, while E! Online ranked Piper at number six on their list of &quot;Pop Culture&#x27;s Top 10 Most Bitchin&#x27; Witches.&quot; In 2012, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; placed The Charmed Ones at number seven on their list of &quot;The Top Pop Culture Witches of All Time.&quot; In 2014, The Charmed Ones were ranked at number six on the &quot;Pop Culture&#x27;s Favorite Witches&quot; list by MSN&#x27;s Wonderwall. In 2016, Piper was also ranked at number six in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;″s list of &quot;The Top 10 Greatest Witches of All Time.&quot;

&quot;Charmed&quot; has also become a pop culture reference in television shows and films. In the 2000 parody film, &quot;Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth&quot;, Barbara Primesuspect (Julie Benz) is said to be yelling &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot; my ass!&quot; at Shannen Doherty, who does not appear on-screen. The series is also mentioned in the episode &quot;Ur-ine Trouble&quot; of teen comedy-drama series &quot;Popular&quot;, when Josh Ford (Bryce Johnson) tells Brooke McQueen (Leslie Bibb) to go home and watch &quot;Charmed&quot;. In another episode of &quot;Popular&quot;, titled &quot;The Shocking Possession of Harrison John,&quot; Josh asks George Austin (Anthony Montgomery) who is Michael Bernardino&#x27;s (Ron Lester) &quot;favorite hottie witch&quot; on &quot;Charmed&quot; and George says it is Prue. In the episode &quot;Faith&quot; of &quot;Third Watch&quot;, Fred Yokas (Chris Bauer) mentions to his wife Faith (Molly Price) that their daughter was upset she could not watch &quot;Charmed&quot;. In the 2002 teen comedy film &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot;, Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) recalls watching an episode of &quot;Charmed&quot; on The WB where Alyssa Milano&#x27;s character Phoebe was about to put a spell on her demon boyfriend.

In a 2003 episode of the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher) and Erin Perry (Talia Zucker) find out they have a lot in common like their love for &quot;Charmed&quot;. In a 2005 episode of &quot;Neighbours&quot;, Bree Timmins (Sianoa Smit-McPhee) mentions that &quot;The O.C.&quot; is the best show on television since &quot;Charmed&quot;. In the episode &quot;Plucky&quot; of sitcom &quot;So Notorious&quot;, Aaron Spelling tells his daughter Tori Spelling that &quot;there&#x27;s always room for another witch on &quot;Charmed&quot;&quot; after hearing of her latest cable telemovie role. In another episode of &quot;So Notorious&quot;, titled &quot;Cursed,&quot; Tori and Sasan (Zachary Quinto) discuss who has put a curse on her and Sasan says, &quot;It&#x27;s Shannen [Doherty]! She knows all that witchcraft from &quot;Charmed&quot;.&quot; In the season four episode &quot;Me and the Devil&quot; of &quot;True Blood&quot;, Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) tells a witch named Marnie Stonebrook (Fiona Shaw) that one of her favorite television shows she watched as a child was &quot;Charmed&quot;. In the episode &quot;Boy Parts&quot; of &quot;American Horror Story: Coven&quot;, a witch named Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe) mentions that she grew up watching &quot;Charmed&quot;. Both the show and character Piper were referenced in the episode &quot;Sorry for Your Loss&quot; of &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, when Piper Nichols (Aeriél Miranda) introduces herself to Russell Kwon (Aaron Yoo), who responds by saying &quot;&quot;Charmed&quot;, Piper.&quot; Critics noted references of &quot;Charmed&quot; in the witchcraft-themed music video for British girl group Little Mix&#x27;s song &quot;Black Magic&quot; (2015).

In the film &quot;Fighting with My Family&quot; (2019), Saraya is watching the episode &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; and this inspires her to come up with her ring name Paige.

===Academia===

Since &quot;Charmed&quot; ended in 2006, academics have appropriated its content and published essays and articles regarding &quot;Charmed&quot;. It has been the subject of several collective books such as &quot;Investigating Charmed: The Magic Power of TV&quot; edited by Karin and Stan Beeler, which adopts a gender perspective to carry out an in-depth analysis of third-wave feminism as shown in the series. Between 2012 and 2015, French academic and essayist Alexis Pichard delivered a set of three lectures on &quot;Charmed&quot;. In 2012, he spoke about intertextuality and postmodernism in the series at the Université de Rouen. In 2014, he explored &quot;Charmed&quot; transmedia storytelling at the Université Paris 3. In 2015, he investigated the show&#x27;s postfeminist subversion of fairy tales at the University of Lorient, a presentation which was followed two years later by the publication in French academic journal &quot;TV/Series&quot; of an article titled &quot;&#x27;When you said sea hag, did you mean like old woman hag or evil magic hag?&#x27; : Imbrication du conte de fées et du (post)féminisme dans Charmed&quot; (&#x27;The embedding of fairy tales and (post)feminism in Charmed&#x27;). The journal&#x27;s editor summarises Pichard&#x27;s work as follows: &quot;Alexis Pichard examines gender norms as they appear on the small screen, scrutinizing the relationship between supernatural soap Charmed (The WB, 1998-2006) and the fairy tale. He describes a complex relationship where literary associations are a way of subverting traditions and expectations on the one hand – and ultimately succumbing to them on the other, with a problematic post-feminist emphasis on &#x27;having it all&#x27;&quot;.

== Other media ==

=== Novels ===

The &quot;Charmed&quot; novels are a series of books that accompany the television series. Between 1999 and 2008, forty-three novels were published by Simon &amp; Schuster and were roughly set during the same period as the events of the television series. The first novel, &quot;The Power of Three&quot;, was released in November 1999 as a novelization of the series premiere episode, &quot;Something Wicca This Way Comes.&quot; All subsequent novels – apart from &quot;Charmed Again&quot; (2001) which narrates the events of the two-part episode of the same name – are original stories revolving around the Halliwell sisters and their allies. The first ten novels involve the original Charmed Ones, Prue, Piper, and Phoebe Halliwell, while the remaining thirty-three are set after both Prue&#x27;s murder and the introduction of Paige Matthews as the youngest, new Charmed One. Two books, &quot;Seasons of the Witch&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Warren Witches&quot; (2005), are anthologies of short stories. Writers of the series include Diana G. Gallagher and Paul Ruditis who also co-authored two volumes of the official guidebook, &quot;The Book of Three&quot; (2004; 2006).

In 2015, HarperCollins acquired the rights to publish a second series of &quot;Charmed&quot; novels from CBS Consumer Products. The first novel, &quot;The War on Witches&quot;, was published in May 2015 and its narrative is set between the events of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; of the comic book series. It is written by Ruditis, who previously authored &quot;Season 9&quot; and edited &quot;Season 10&quot;, and follows the younger Charmed Ones&#x27; reunions with Prue and Cole Turner after their resurrections.

=== Comic books ===

The &quot;Charmed&quot; comic books serve as a continuation of the television series and were originally published by Zenescope Entertainment. The first comic book series, &quot;&quot;, was released in June 2010 and is set eighteen months after the events of the televised show&#x27;s final episode, &quot;Forever Charmed.&quot; Author Paul Ruditis was the lead writer of the first series and Raven Gregory helped him co-write the first three issues. The second and final comic book series by Zenescope, &quot;&quot;, debuted at the New York Comic Con during the weekend of October 9, 2014. Pat Shand was the lead writer of the second series while Ruditis assumed the role of editor. In 2017, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the rights to publish a new comic book series titled &quot;Charmed: A Thousand Deaths&quot;. It was written by Erica Schultz and illustrated by Maria Sanapo.

The second soundtrack, &quot;&quot;, was released in January 2005 and the third, &quot;Charmed: The Final Chapter&quot;, was released in May 2006. A retrospect of songs compiled from all eight seasons of the show, &quot;Charmed: The Final Chapter&quot; was positively received by Heather Phares of AllMusic, who praised it for &quot;feel[ing] like a late &#x27;90s/early 2000s time capsule&quot;. The fourth soundtrack, &quot;Charmed: Score from the Television Series&quot;, was released as a limited edition in June 2013 and featured a selection of cues from the show by composer J. Peter Robinson. This is now out of print.

On December 13, 2019, Koch Films announced a full series release on Blu-ray for Charmed in Germany, making Germany the first country worldwide to receive a full Blu-ray set rather than individual seasons like in the United States. The Blu-ray box set edition was released on June 24, 2021.

=== Podcast ===

On September 1, 2022, three members of the Charmed cast started a podcast called &quot;The House of Halliwell / A Charmed Rewatch Podcast&quot;. At Dragon Con, Drew Fuller explains that he had not watched Charmed and recruited his fellow co-stars to create a rewatch podcast. Holly Marie Combs recalls a cancer scare during &quot;The Power of Two&quot; episode. She revealed that a tumor was discover in her uterus while filming an episode of Charmed with the same name. As a result, production of the show was shut down for two weeks. Brian Krause discussed how Charmed impacted its viewers by bringing them together with family and assisting individuals in accepting themselves. He also reveals in the podcast that this is his first time watching the show.

== Reboot series ==
=== Canceled CBS reboot ===
On October 25, 2013, it was announced that CBS was developing a reboot of &quot;Charmed&quot;. &quot;Party of Five&quot; co-creator Christopher Keyser and Sydney Sidner were going to executive produce and write the pilot script for CBS Television Studios (who own the rights to &quot;Charmed&quot;) and The Tannenbaum Company. The reboot was described as a &quot;re-imagining of the original series centered around four sisters who discover their destiny – to battle against the forces of evil using their witchcraft.&quot; CBS only ordered a script for a pilot, however; no commitment to filming was made.

Following the announcement, the original cast of &quot;Charmed&quot; shared their opinions of the reboot through Twitter. Rose McGowan tweeted, &quot;They really are running out of ideas in Hollywood,&quot; followed up by another tweet, &quot;lame lame lame lamertons.&quot; Alyssa Milano tweeted, &quot;The thing about them doing a #charmed reboot is ... it just ... it feels like yesterday. It feels too close.&quot; Holly Marie Combs tweeted, &quot;Here&#x27;s the thing. Everything is a reboot. If you think otherwise you haven&#x27;t read enough Shakespeare yet. At least they had the decency to call it what it is. Instead of ripping it off and then pretending to not be ripping it off.&quot; Shannen Doherty tweeted to a fan, &quot;I don&#x27;t know yet. It&#x27;s strange to think about a reboot. I guess I&#x27;m still processing the idea.&quot; However, on August 12, 2014, TVLine&#x27;s Michael Ausiello revealed that CBS was not moving forward with the reboot.

=== The CW reboot ===

On January 25, 2018, The CW network officially ordered a pilot of a new &quot;Charmed&quot; reboot, developed by Jennie Snyder Urman, Jessica O&#x27;Toole and Amy Rardin, for the 2018–19 television season. The reboot was described by The CW as &quot;a fierce, funny, feminist reboot&quot; of the original series. It follows the lives of three sisters—Macy, Mel and Maggie—who, after the death of their mother, discover they are The Charmed Ones, the most powerful trio of good witches, who are destined to protect innocent lives from demons and other dark forces. The eldest sister Macy is a &quot;practical, driven, and brilliant geneticist&quot; with the power of telekinesis. The middle sister Mel is &quot;a passionate, outspoken activist&quot; and lesbian with the power of time-freezing, while the youngest Maggie is &quot;a bubbly college freshman&quot; with the power to hear people&#x27;s thoughts. Madeleine Mantock was cast as Macy, Melonie Diaz was cast as Mel, Sarah Jeffery was cast as Maggie, and Rupert Evans was cast as the trio&#x27;s whitelighter Harry. The reboot premiered on The CW on October 14, 2018, 20 years after the original series&#x27; premiere. The CW renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on October 11, 2019. The reboot would ultimately run for four seasons and 72 episodes before being canceled in May 2022.

<doc id="212373" wikidata="Q809420" url="?curid=212373" title="Barthélemy-Prosper Enfantin">
<text>Barthélemy-Prosper Enfantin (8 February 17961 September 1864) was a French social reformer, one of the founders of Saint-Simonianism. He was also a proponent of a Suez Canal.

== Early life ==
Enfantin was born in Paris, the son of a banker of Dauphiné. After receiving his early education at a lyceum, he was sent in 1813 to the École polytechnique. In March 1814 he was one of the band of students who, on the heights of Montmartre and Saint-Chaumont, attempted resistance to the armies of the Sixth Coalition which had engaged in the invasion of Paris. In consequence of this outbreak of patriotic enthusiasm, the school was soon after closed by Louis XVIII, and the young student was compelled to seek another career.

Initially, he began working for a country wine merchant, travelling to Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1821 he entered a banking-house newly established at Saint Petersburg, but returned two years later to Paris, where he was appointed cashier to the &quot;Caisse Hypothécaire&quot;. At the same time, he became a member of the secret society of the &quot;Carbonari&quot;.

In 1825 a new turn was given to his thoughts and his life by the friendship which he formed with Olinde Rodriguez, who introduced him to the Comte de Saint-Simon. He affiliated to Saint-Simon&#x27;s version of utopian socialism, and, by 1829, he had become one of the acknowledged heads of the movement.

== Preaching and politics ==
After the July Revolution of 1830 Enfantin resigned his office of cashier, and devoted all his energy to the cause. Besides contributing to &quot;Le Globe&quot;, he made appeals to the people by systematic preaching, and organized centres of action in some of the main cities of France.

The headquarters in Paris were moved from the modest rooms in the Rue Taranne to the large halls near the Boulevard des Italiens. Enfantin and Amand Bazard were proclaimed &quot;Pères Suprêmes&quot; (&quot;Supreme Fathers&quot;) – a union which was, however, only nominal, as a divergence was already manifest. Bazard, who concentrated on organizing the group, had devoted himself to political reform, while Enfantin, who favoured teaching and preaching, dedicated his time to social and moral change. The antagonism was widened by Enfantin&#x27;s announcement of his theory of the relation of man and woman, which would substitute for the &quot;tyranny of marriage&quot; a system of &quot;free love&quot;.

Bazard and his disciples broke with Enfantin&#x27;s group. The latter became sole &quot;father&quot;, leading a chiefly religiously-oriented movement, joined by new converts (according to Enfantin&#x27;s estimate, the total number of followers would have reached 40,000). He wore on his breast a badge with his title of &quot;Père&quot;, was referred to by his preachers as &quot;the living law&quot;, declared himself to be the chosen of God, and sent out emissaries in a quest of a woman predestined to be the &quot;female Messiah,&quot; and the mother of a new Saviour (the latter quest was very costly and altogether fruitless).

== Success and repression ==
Meanwhile, the new religion gathered believers in all parts of Europe. His extravagances and success at length brought him to the attention of authorities, who argued that he was endangering public morality - Enfantin had announced that the gulf between the sexes was too wide and this social inequality would impede rapid growth of society. Enfantin called for the abolition of prostitution and for the ability for women to divorce and obtain legal rights. This was considered radical for the time. In May 1832 the halls of the new sect were closed by the government, and the &quot;Père&quot;, with some of his followers, appeared before the tribunals. He then retired to his estate at Menilmontant, near Paris, where with forty disciples, all of them men, he continued to carry out his socialist views. In August of the same year he was again arrested, and on his appearance in court he desired his defence to be undertaken by two women who were with him, alleging that the matter was of special concern to women; the request was promptly refused. The trial occupied two days and resulted in a verdict of guilty, and a sentence of imprisonment for a year with a small fine.

This prosecution discredited the new society. Enfantin was released in a few months.

==Turkey and Egypt==
Then, accompanied by twenty of his followers, many of whom were also engineers from the Ecole Polytechnique, including Charles Joseph Lambert, also known as Lambert-Bey, and some women, he went first to Istanbul. Enfantin had declared 1833 the Year of the Mother, and upon arrival in Istanbul the group began to strongly preach their views about gender relations and New Christianity. The Ottoman Empire told them to leave to avoid prison.

Enfantin and his group then arrived in Egypt, where he planned to penetrate the feminine Orient with the masculine Occident in a consummation of progression - build a canal connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea. In Egypt at that time, Muhammad Ali, the Egyptian Viceroy, was at odds with the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, and also practiced public-private contracts known as concessions with mostly European companies to build cheap infrastructure. Ali did not agree to a project linking the two seas because he did not want to cut out the duties he collected from overland trade in Egypt, but did allow Enfantin&#x27;s group to work on the Delta Barrage - a type of dam - north of Cairo - with unpaid laborers - that would act to limit Nile flooding and create predictable crop yields. During his time in Egypt, Enfantine also established technical schools based on the Ecole Polytechnique model with Ali&#x27;s blessing. Also in Egypt he encountered and influenced Ferdinand de Lesseps. Enfantine returned to France in 1836, lacking the patience to finish the Nile barrage project that was encountering delays.

== Return to France ==

On his return to France, he occupied minor offices. He became first a postmaster near Lyon, and in 1841 was appointed, through the influence of some of his friends who had risen to posts of power, member of a scientific commission on Algeria, which led him to engage in researches concerning North Africa and colonization in general.

In 1845 he was appointed a director of the Paris &amp; Lyons railway. Three years later he established, in conjunction with Duveyrier, a daily journal, entitled &quot;Le Credit&quot;, which was discontinued in 1850. He was afterwards attached to the administration of the railway from Lyons to the Mediterranean.

==Société d&#x27;Études du Canal de Suez==
Father Enfantin held fast by his ideal to the end, but he had renounced the hope of giving it a local habitation and a name in the degenerate obstinate world. His personal influence over those who associated with him was immense. &quot;He was a man of a noble presence, with finely formed and expressive features. He was gentle and insinuating in manner, and possessed a calm, graceful and winning delivery&quot; (&quot;Gent. M .&quot; Jan. 1865). His evident sincerity, his genuine enthusiasm, gave him his marvellous ascendancy. The Société d&#x27;Études du Canal de Suez was established by Enfantin in 1846 to continue study of the Suez Canal. Its members included Arlès-Dufour, Jules, Lon and Paulin Talabot, the British Robert Stephenson and Edward Starbuck, the Austrian Alois Negrelli, inspector of the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway, and Feronce and Sellier of Leipzig as representatives of the German interest.

The Société sent surveying teams to Egypt, developed engineering plans, determined that the elevation difference between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea was negligible, but Muhammad Ali was still reticent to the idea of a canal. Upon his death in 1848, the activities of the Société were minimized until his successor was assassinated in 1854 and Ferdinand de Lesseps took up the initiative to build a canal. Lessups had corresponded at least once with the Société in the intervening years and had known the new Egyptian viceroy, Sa&#x27;id, when he was a young man. Enfantin was listed by Lessups as a founder of the Suez Canal Company.

Not a few of his disciples ranked afterwards amongst the most distinguished men of France. Enfantin died suddenly in Paris on September 1, 1864.

== Literary works ==
Amongst his works are: &quot;Doctrine de Saint-Simon&quot; (written in conjunction with several of his followers), published in 1830, and several times republished; &quot;Economie politique et politique Saint-Simonienne&quot; (1831); &quot;&quot; (1835–1840); &quot;Corresp. philos. et religieuse&quot; (1843–1845); and &quot;La Vie eternelle passee, presente, future&quot; (1861). A large number of articles by his hand appeared in &quot;Le Producteur&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Organisateur&quot;, &quot;Le Globe&quot;, and other periodicals. He also wrote in 1832 &quot;Le Livre nouveau&quot;, intended as a substitute for the Christian Scriptures, but it was not published.

<doc id="212374" wikidata="Q13599969" url="?curid=212374" title="Nebular hypothesis">
<text>The nebular hypothesis is the most widely accepted model in the field of cosmogony to explain the formation and evolution of the Solar System (as well as other planetary systems). It suggests the Solar System is formed from gas and dust orbiting the Sun which clumped up together to form the planets. The theory was developed by Immanuel Kant and published in his &quot;Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens&quot; (1755) and then modified in 1796 by Pierre Laplace. Originally applied to the Solar System, the process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the universe. The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular theory is the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) or solar nebular model. It offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System, including the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of the planets, and their motion in the same direction as the Sun&#x27;s rotation. Some elements of the original nebular theory are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation, but most elements have been superseded.

According to the nebular theory, stars form in massive and dense clouds of molecular hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation is a complex process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk (proplyd) around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems is thought to be a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1 million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next 10–100 million years.

The protoplanetary disk is an accretion disk that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools in what is known as the T Tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000 years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100 million to a billion years.

The formation of giant planets is a more complicated process. It is thought to occur beyond the frost line, where planetary embryos mainly are made of various types of ice. As a result, they are several times more massive than in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk. What follows after the embryo formation is not completely clear. Some embryos appear to continue to grow and eventually reach 5–10 Earth masses—the threshold value, which is necessary to begin accretion of the hydrogen–helium gas from the disk. The accumulation of gas by the core is initially a slow process, which continues for several million years, but after the forming protoplanet reaches about 30 Earth masses () it accelerates and proceeds in a runaway manner. Jupiter- and Saturn-like planets are thought to accumulate the bulk of their mass during only 10,000 years. The accretion stops when the gas is exhausted. The formed planets can migrate over long distances during or after their formation. Ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune are thought to be failed cores, which formed too late when the disk had almost disappeared.

== History ==

There is evidence that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular theory in 1734. Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg&#x27;s work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own &quot;Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens&quot;, wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity, eventually forming stars and planets.

Pierre-Simon Laplace independently developed and proposed a similar model in 1796 in his &quot;Exposition du systeme du monde&quot;. He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout the volume of the Solar System. His theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud—the protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) a series of gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. His model was similar to Kant&#x27;s, except more detailed and on a smaller scale. While the Laplacian nebular model dominated in the 19th century, it encountered a number of difficulties. The main problem involved angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model. As a result, astronomers largely abandoned this theory of planet formation at the beginning of the 20th century.

According to some, a major critique came during the 19th century from James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879), who in some sources is claimed to have maintained that &quot;different rotation between the inner and outer parts of a ring&quot; could not allow condensation of material. However, both the critique and the attribution to Maxwell have been deemed to be incorrect upon further investigation, with the original error being made by George Gamow in some popular publications and propagated continually ever since. Astronomer Sir David Brewster also rejected Laplace, writing in 1876 that &quot;those who believe in the Nebular Theory consider it as certain that our Earth derived its solid matter and its atmosphere from a ring thrown from the Solar atmosphere, which afterwards contracted into a solid terraqueous sphere, from which the Moon was thrown off by the same process&quot;. He argued that under such view, &quot;the Moon must necessarily have carried off water and air from the watery and aerial parts of the Earth and must have an atmosphere&quot;. Brewster claimed that Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s religious beliefs had previously considered nebular ideas as tending to atheism, and quoted him as saying that &quot;the growth of new systems out of old ones, without the mediation of a Divine power, seemed to him apparently absurd&quot;.

The perceived deficiencies of the Laplacian model stimulated scientists to find a replacement for it. During the 20th century many theories addressed the issue, including the &quot;planetesimal theory&quot; of Thomas Chamberlin and Forest Moulton (1901), the &quot;tidal model&quot; of James Jeans (1917), the &quot;accretion model&quot; of Otto Schmidt (1944), the &quot;protoplanet theory&quot; of William McCrea (1960) and finally the &quot;capture theory&quot; of Michael Woolfson. In 1978 Andrew Prentice resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the &quot;modern Laplacian theory&quot;. None of these attempts proved completely successful, and many of the proposed theories were descriptive.

The birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation—the solar nebular disk model (SNDM)—can be traced to the Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov. His 1969 book &quot;Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets&quot;, which was translated to English in 1972, had a long-lasting effect on the way scientists think about the formation of the planets. In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov&#x27;s ideas were further developed in the works of George Wetherill, who discovered &quot;runaway accretion&quot;. While originally applied only to the Solar System, the SNDM was subsequently thought by theorists to be at work throughout the Universe; as of astronomers have discovered extrasolar planets in our galaxy.

== Solar nebular model: achievements and problems ==

=== Achievements ===
The star formation process naturally results in the appearance of accretion disks around young stellar objects. At the age of about 1 million years, 100% of stars may have such disks. This conclusion is supported by the discovery of the gaseous and dusty disks around protostars and T Tauri stars as well as by theoretical considerations. Observations of these disks show that the dust grains inside them grow in size on short (thousand-year) time scales, producing 1 centimeter sized particles.

The accretion process, by which 1 km planetesimals grow into 1,000 km sized bodies, is well understood now. This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high, and proceeds in a runaway manner. Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion. The end result is formation of planetary embryos of varying sizes, which depend on the distance from the star. Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a few Earth-sized bodies. Thus the origin of terrestrial planets is now considered to be an almost solved problem.

=== Current issues ===
The physics of accretion disks encounters some problems. The most important one is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its angular momentum. One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star&#x27;s magnetic field. The main processes responsible for the disappearance of the gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.

The formation of planetesimals is the biggest unsolved problem in the nebular disk model. How 1 cm sized particles coalesce into 1 km planetesimals is a mystery. This mechanism appears to be the key to the question as to why some stars have planets, while others have nothing around them, not even dust belts.

The formation timescale of giant planets is also an important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (107) years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.

Another potential problem of giant planet formation is their orbital migration. Some calculations show that interaction with the disk can cause rapid inward migration, which, if not stopped, results in the planet reaching the &quot;central regions still as a sub-Jovian object.&quot; More recent calculations indicate that disk evolution during migration can mitigate this problem.

== Formation of stars and protoplanetary disks ==

=== Protostars ===
Stars are thought to form inside giant clouds of cold molecular hydrogen—giant molecular clouds roughly 300,000 times the mass of the Sun () and 20 parsecs in diameter. Over millions of years, giant molecular clouds are prone to collapse and fragmentation. These fragments then form small, dense cores, which in turn collapse into stars. The cores range in mass from a fraction to several times that of the Sun and are called protostellar (protosolar) nebulae. They possess diameters of 0.01–0.1 pc (2,000–20,000 AU) and a particle number density of roughly 10,000 to 100,000 cm−3.

The initial collapse of a solar-mass protostellar nebula takes around 100,000 years. Every nebula begins with a certain amount of angular momentum. Gas in the central part of the nebula, with relatively low angular momentum, undergoes fast compression and forms a hot hydrostatic (not contracting) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula. This core forms the seed of what will become a star. As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation of the infalling envelope accelerates, which largely prevents the gas from directly accreting onto the central core. The gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane, forming a disk, which in turn accretes onto the core. The core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot protostar. At this stage, the protostar and its disk are heavily obscured by the infalling envelope and are not directly observable. In fact the remaining envelope&#x27;s opacity is so high that even millimeter-wave radiation has trouble escaping from inside it. Such objects are observed as very bright condensations, which emit mainly millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave radiation. They are classified as spectral Class 0 protostars. The collapse is often accompanied by bipolar outflows—jets—that emanate along the rotational axis of the inferred disk. The jets are frequently observed in star-forming regions (see Herbig–Haro (HH) objects). The luminosity of the Class 0 protostars is high — a solar-mass protostar may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities. The source of this energy is gravitational collapse, as their cores are not yet hot enough to begin nuclear fusion.
As the infall of its material onto the disk continues, the envelope eventually becomes thin and transparent and the young stellar object (YSO) becomes observable, initially in far-infrared light and later in the visible. Around this time the protostar begins to fuse deuterium. If the protostar is sufficiently massive (above 80 Jupiter masses ()), hydrogen fusion follows. Otherwise, if its mass is too low, the object becomes a brown dwarf. This birth of a new star occurs approximately 100,000 years after the collapse begins. Objects at this stage are known as Class I protostars, which are also called young T Tauri stars, evolved protostars, or young stellar objects. By this time the forming star has already accreted much of its mass: the total mass of the disk and remaining envelope does not exceed 10–20% of the mass of the central YSO.

At the next stage the envelope completely disappears, having been gathered up by the disk, and the protostar becomes a classical T Tauri star. This happens after about 1 million years. The mass of the disk around a classical T Tauri star is about 1–3% of the stellar mass, and it is accreted at a rate of 10−7 to per year. A pair of bipolar jets is usually present as well. The accretion explains all peculiar properties of classical T Tauri stars: strong flux in the emission lines (up to 100% of the intrinsic luminosity of the star), magnetic activity, photometric variability and jets. The emission lines actually form as the accreted gas hits the &quot;surface&quot; of the star, which happens around its magnetic poles. The jets are byproducts of accretion: they carry away excessive angular momentum. The classical T Tauri stage lasts about 10 million years. The disk eventually disappears due to accretion onto the central star, planet formation, ejection by jets and photoevaporation by UV-radiation from the central star and nearby stars. As a result, the young star becomes a weakly lined T Tauri star, which slowly, over hundreds of millions of years, evolves into an ordinary Sun-like star.

=== Protoplanetary disks ===
Under certain circumstances the disk, which can now be called protoplanetary, may give birth to a planetary system. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young star clusters. They exist from the beginning of a star&#x27;s formation, but at the earliest stages are unobservable due to the opacity of the surrounding envelope. The disk of a Class 0 protostar is thought to be massive and hot. It is an accretion disk, which feeds the central protostar. The temperature can easily exceed 400 K inside 5 AU and 1,000 K inside 1 AU. The heating of the disk is primarily caused by the viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula. The high temperature in the inner disk causes most of the volatile material—water, organics, and some rocks—to evaporate, leaving only the most refractory elements like iron. The ice can survive only in the outer part of the disk.

The main problem in the physics of accretion disks is the generation of turbulence and the mechanism responsible for the high effective viscosity. The turbulent viscosity is thought to be responsible for the transport of the mass to the central protostar and momentum to the periphery of the disk. This is vital for accretion, because the gas can be accreted by the central protostar only if it loses most of its angular momentum, which must be carried away by the small part of the gas drifting outwards. The result of this process is the growth of both the protostar and of the disk radius, which can reach 1,000 AU if the initial angular momentum of the nebula is large enough. Large disks are routinely observed in many star-forming regions such as the Orion nebula.

The lifespan of the accretion disks is about 10 million years. By the time the star reaches the classical T-Tauri stage, the disk becomes thinner and cools. Less volatile materials start to condense close to its center, forming 0.1–1 μm dust grains that contain crystalline silicates. The transport of the material from the outer disk can mix these newly formed dust grains with primordial ones, which contain organic matter and other volatiles. This mixing can explain some peculiarities in the composition of Solar System bodies such as the presence of interstellar grains in primitive meteorites and refractory inclusions in comets.

Dust particles tend to stick to each other in the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1 km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.

One hypothesis is formation by gravitational instability. Particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle near the middle plane of the disk, forming a very thin—less than 100 km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, which in turn collapse into planetesimals. However, the differing velocities of the gas disk and the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational instability. This may limit the formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in the disk where the concentration of solids is enhanced.

Another possible mechanism for the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentrations push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.

Planetary formation can also be triggered by gravitational instability within the disk itself, which leads to its fragmentation into clumps. Some of them, if they are dense enough, will collapse, which can lead to rapid formation of gas giant planets and even brown dwarfs on the timescale of 1,000 years. If these clumps migrate inward as the collapse proceeds tidal forces from the star can result in a significant mass loss leaving behind a smaller body. However it is only possible in massive disks—more massive than . In comparison, typical disk masses are . Because the massive disks are rare, this mechanism of planet formation is thought to be infrequent. On the other hand, it may play a major role in the formation of brown dwarfs.

The ultimate dissipation of protoplanetary disks is triggered by a number of different mechanisms. The inner part of the disk is either accreted by the star or ejected by the bipolar jets, whereas the outer part can evaporate under the star&#x27;s powerful UV radiation during the T Tauri stage or by nearby stars. The gas in the central part can either be accreted or ejected by the growing planets, while the small dust particles are ejected by the radiation pressure of the central star. What is finally left is either a planetary system, a remnant disk of dust without planets, or nothing, if planetesimals failed to form.

Because planetesimals are so numerous, and spread throughout the protoplanetary disk, some survive the formation of a planetary system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide a great deal of information about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals. Interstellar objects could have been captured, and become part of the young Solar system.

== Formation of planets ==

=== Rocky planets ===
According to the solar nebular disk model, rocky planets form in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the temperature is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains. This results in coagulation of purely rocky grains and later in the formation of rocky planetesimals. Such conditions are thought to exist in the inner 3–4 AU part of the disk of a Sun-like star.

After small planetesimals—about 1 km in diameter—have formed by one way or another, &quot;runaway accretion&quot; begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. The specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000 years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000 km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.

The next stage is called &quot;oligarchic accretion&quot;. It is characterized by the dominance of several hundred of the largest bodies—oligarchs, which continue to slowly accrete planetesimals. No body other than the oligarchs can grow. At this stage the rate of accretion is proportional to R2, which is derived from the geometrical cross-section of an oligarch. The specific accretion rate is proportional to ; and it declines with the mass of the body. This allows smaller oligarchs to catch up to larger ones. The oligarchs are kept at the distance of about (= is the Hill radius, where a is the semimajor axis, e is the orbital eccentricity, and Ms is the mass of the central star) from each other by the influence of the remaining planetesimals. Their orbital eccentricities and inclinations remain small. The oligarchs continue to accrete until planetesimals are exhausted in the disk around them. Sometimes nearby oligarchs merge. The final mass of an oligarch depends on the distance from the star and surface density of planetesimals and is called the isolation mass. For the rocky planets it is up to , or one Mars mass. The final result of the oligarchic stage is the formation of about 100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos uniformly spaced at about . They are thought to reside inside gaps in the disk and to be separated by rings of remaining planetesimals. This stage is thought to last a few hundred thousand years.

The last stage of rocky planet formation is the &quot;merger stage&quot;. It begins when only a small number of planetesimals remains and embryos become massive enough to perturb each other, which causes their orbits to become chaotic. During this stage embryos expel remaining planetesimals, and collide with each other. The result of this process, which lasts for 10 to 100 million years, is the formation of a limited number of Earth-sized bodies. Simulations show that the number of surviving planets is on average from 2 to 5. In the Solar System they may be represented by Earth and Venus. Formation of both planets required merging of approximately 10–20 embryos, while an equal number of them were thrown out of the Solar System. Some of the embryos, which originated in the asteroid belt, are thought to have brought water to Earth. Mars and Mercury may be regarded as remaining embryos that survived that rivalry. Rocky planets which have managed to coalesce settle eventually into more or less stable orbits, explaining why planetary systems are generally packed to the limit; or, in other words, why they always appear to be at the brink of instability.

=== Giant planets ===

The formation of giant planets is an outstanding problem in the planetary sciences. In the framework of the solar nebular model two theories for their formation exist. The first one is the &quot;disk instability model&quot;, where giant planets form in the massive protoplanetary disks as a result of its gravitational fragmentation (see above). The second possibility is the &quot;core accretion model&quot;, which is also known as the &quot;nucleated instability model&quot;. The latter scenario is thought to be the most promising one, because it can explain the formation of the giant planets in relatively low-mass disks (less than ). In this model giant planet formation is divided into two stages: a) accretion of a core of approximately and b) accretion of gas from the protoplanetary disk. Either method may also lead to the creation of brown dwarfs. Searches as of 2011 have found that core accretion is likely the dominant formation mechanism.

Giant planet core formation is thought to proceed roughly along the lines of the terrestrial planet formation. It starts with planetesimals that undergo runaway growth, followed by the slower oligarchic stage. Hypotheses do not predict a merger stage, due to the low probability of collisions between planetary embryos in the outer part of planetary systems. An additional difference is the composition of the planetesimals, which in the case of giant planets form beyond the so-called frost line and consist mainly of ice—the ice to rock ratio is about 4 to 1. This enhances the mass of planetesimals fourfold. However, the minimum mass nebula capable of terrestrial planet formation can only form cores at the distance of Jupiter (5 AU) within 10 million years. The latter number represents the average lifetime of gaseous disks around Sun-like stars. The proposed solutions include enhanced mass of the disk—a tenfold increase would suffice; protoplanet migration, which allows the embryo to accrete more planetesimals; and finally accretion enhancement due to gas drag in the gaseous envelopes of the embryos. Some combination of the above-mentioned ideas may explain the formation of the cores of gas giant planets such as Jupiter and perhaps even Saturn. The formation of planets like Uranus and Neptune is more problematic, since no theory has been capable of providing for the in situ formation of their cores at the distance of 20–30 AU from the central star. One hypothesis is that they initially accreted in the Jupiter-Saturn region, then were scattered and migrated to their present location. Another possible solution is the growth of the cores of the giant planets via pebble accretion. In pebble accretion objects between a cm and a meter in diameter falling toward a massive body are slowed enough by gas drag for them to spiral toward it and be accreted. Growth via pebble accretion may be as much as 1000 times faster than by the accretion of planetesimals.

Once the cores are of sufficient mass (), they begin to gather gas from the surrounding disk. Initially it is a slow process, increasing the core masses up to in a few million years. After that, the accretion rates increase dramatically and the remaining 90% of the mass is accumulated in approximately 10,000 years. The accretion of gas stops when the supply from the disk is exhausted. This happens gradually, due to the formation of a density gap in the protoplanetary disk and to disk dispersal. In this model ice giants—Uranus and Neptune—are failed cores that began gas accretion too late, when almost all gas had already disappeared. The post-runaway-gas-accretion stage is characterized by migration of the newly formed giant planets and continued slow gas accretion. Migration is caused by the interaction of the planet sitting in the gap with the remaining disk. It stops when the protoplanetary disk disappears or when the end of the disk is attained. The latter case corresponds to the so-called hot Jupiters, which are likely to have stopped their migration when they reached the inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.

During the accretion of gas via streams, a giant planet can be surrounded by a circumplanetary disk. This circumplanetary disk also carries solids and can form satellites. The Galilean moons are thought to have formed in such a circumplanetary disk.

Giant planets can significantly influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4 AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form near the end of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.

The region of a planetary system adjacent to the giant planets will be influenced in a different way. In such a region, eccentricities of embryos may become so large that the embryos pass close to a giant planet, which may cause them to be ejected from the system. If all embryos are removed, then no planets will form in this region. An additional consequence is that a huge number of small planetesimals will remain, because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out without the help of embryos. The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small, because cumulative action of the embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99% of the small bodies. Such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt, which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System, located from 2 to 4 AU from the Sun.

===Exoplanets===

Thousands of exoplanets have been identified in the last twenty years, with, at the very least, billions more, within our observable universe, yet to be discovered. The orbits of many of these planets and systems of planets differ significantly from the planets in the Solar System. The exoplanets discovered include hot-Jupiters, warm-Jupiters, super-Earths, and systems of tightly packed inner planets.

The hot-Jupiters and warm-Jupiters are thought to have migrated to their current orbits during or following their formation. A number of possible mechanisms for this migration have been proposed. Type I or Type II migration could smoothly decrease the semimajor axis of the planet&#x27;s orbit resulting in a warm- or hot-Jupiter. Gravitational scattering by other planets onto eccentric orbits with a perihelion near the star followed by the circularization of its orbit due to tidal interactions with the star can leave a planet on a close orbit. If a massive companion planet or star on an inclined orbit was present an exchange of inclination for eccentricity via the Kozai mechanism raising eccentricities and lowering perihelion followed by circularization can also result in a close orbit. Many of the Jupiter-sized planets have eccentric orbits which may indicate that gravitational encounters occurred between the planets, although migration while in resonance can also excite eccentricities. The in situ growth of hot Jupiters from closely orbiting super Earths has also been proposed. The cores in this hypothesis could have formed locally or at a greater distance and migrated close to the star.

Super-Earths and other closely orbiting planets are thought to have either formed in situ or ex situ, that is, to have migrated inward from their initial locations. The in situ formation of closely orbiting super-Earths would require a massive disk, the migration of planetary embryos followed by collisions and mergers, or the radial drift of small solids from farther out in the disk. The migration of the super-Earths, or the embryos that collided to form them, is likely to have been Type I due to their smaller mass. The resonant orbits of some of the exoplanet systems indicates that some migration occurred in these systems, while the spacing of the orbits in many of the other systems not in resonance indicates that an instability likely occurred in those systems after the dissipation of the gas disk. The absence of Super-Earths and closely orbiting planets in the Solar System may be due to the previous formation of Jupiter blocking their inward migration.

The amount of gas a super-Earth that formed in situ acquires may depend on when the planetary embryos merged due to giant impacts relative to the dissipation of the gas disk. If the mergers happen after the gas disk dissipates terrestrial planets can form, if in a transition disk a super-Earth with a gas envelope containing a few percent of its mass may form. If the mergers happen too early runaway gas accretion may occur leading to the formation of a gas giant. The mergers begin when the dynamical friction due to the gas disk becomes insufficient to prevent collisions, a process that will begin earlier in a higher metallicity disk. Alternatively gas accretion may be limited due to the envelopes not being in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead gas may flow through the envelope slowing its growth and delaying the onset of runaway gas accretion until the mass of the core reaches 15 Earth masses.

== Meaning of &quot;accretion&quot; ==
Use of the term &quot;accretion disk&quot; for the protoplanetary disk leads to confusion over the planetary accretion process.
The protoplanetary disk is sometimes referred to as an accretion disk, because while the young T Tauri-like protostar is still contracting, gaseous material may still be falling onto it, accreting on its surface from the disk&#x27;s inner edge. In an accretion disk, there is a net flux of mass from larger radii toward smaller radii.

However, that meaning should not be confused with the process of accretion forming the planets. In this context, accretion refers to the process of cooled, solidified grains of dust and ice orbiting the protostar in the protoplanetary disk, colliding and sticking together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable planetesimals.

In addition, the giant planets probably had accretion disks of their own, in the first meaning of the word. The clouds of captured hydrogen and helium gas contracted, spun up, flattened, and deposited gas onto the surface of each giant protoplanet, while solid bodies within that disk accreted into the giant planet&#x27;s regular moons.

<text>Saint-Amand Bazard (18 September 179129 July 1832) was a French socialist, the founder of a secret society in France corresponding to the Carbonari of Italy.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris. He took part in the defence of Paris in 1815, and afterwards occupied a subordinate situation in the prefecture of the Seine département. At 25 years of age, he was appointed a knight of the Legion of Honor. About 1820, he united some of his patriotic friends into a society called &quot;Amis de la vérité&quot; (literally &quot;Friends of the truth&quot;). From this, a complete system of Carbonarism developed, whose peculiar principles were introduced from Italy by two of Bazard&#x27;s friends. 
Bazard himself was at the head of the central body, and, while taking a general lead, contributed extensively to the Carbonarist journal, &quot;L&#x27;Aristarque&quot;. An unsuccessful outbreak at Belfort ruined the society, and the leaders were compelled to conceal themselves. Bazard, after remaining for some time in obscurity in Paris, came to the conclusion that the ends of those who wished well to the people would be most easily attained, not through political agitation, but by effecting a radical change in their social condition.

This train of thinking naturally drew him towards the socialist philosophers of the school of Saint-Simon, whom he joined, he contributed to their journal, &quot;Le Producteur&quot;; and in 1828 began to give public lectures on the principles of the school. His opposition to the emancipation of women brought about a quarrel with Enfantin in 1831, and Bazard found himself almost deserted by the members of the society. He attacked Enfantin violently, and, in a heated argument among them, he was struck down by apoplexy. After lingering for a few months, he died in Courtry.

<text>Francisco Peña Pérez (born 1 June 1942), known as Paco Peña, is a Spanish flamenco composer and guitarist. He is regarded as one of the world&#x27;s foremost traditional flamenco players.

==Biography==
Born in Córdoba, Spain, as Francisco Peña Pérez, Paco Peña began learning to play the guitar from his brother at the age of six and made his first professional appearance aged 12. Encouraged by his family, he left home and began performing throughout Spain as part of a government-sponsored folk music and dance program. This led to calls from professional flamenco companies in Madrid and the Costa Brava, where Peña established himself as a highly regarded accompanist to flamenco dance and singing. However, dissatisfied with life on the coast and seeking a new challenge, he moved to London in the late 1960s to become a soloist.

Initially the star attraction at the Restaurante Antonio in Covent Garden, Peña generated so much interest among the British public previously uninitiated in flamenco that he soon found himself sharing concerts with artists such as Jimi Hendrix, and made his solo debut at Wigmore Hall in 1967. It was not long before Peña was touring the world, both as a soloist and an accompanist with performances at Carnegie Hall in New York City, the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. He later founded the world&#x27;s first university course on flamenco guitar, at the Rotterdam conservatory of music. In 1984 Peña was interviewed by Julian Bream for the Channel 4 television series &quot;Guitarra!&quot;, which traces the development of the guitar in Spain.

Peña also created the Centro Flamenco Paco Peña in Córdoba, and was responsible for the founding of the now-celebrated annual Córdoba Guitar Festival, which has seen appearances by other flamenco greats such as Manolo Sanlúcar and Paco de Lucía.

In 1997 Peña was named Oficial de la Cruz de la Orden del Mérito Civil by King Juan Carlos of Spain.

His most famous compositions include his &quot;Misa Flamenca&quot; (a flamenco Mass), and &quot;Requiem for the Earth&quot;, both of which have received great critical acclaim.

He has also had a number of notable collaborations, significantly with the Argentinian guitarist Eduardo Falú and the Chilean group Inti-Illimani.

Peña has homes in London and Córdoba. Recent shows include &quot;Flamenco Sin Fronteras&quot;, which explores the relationship between Venezuelan music and flamenco; and &quot;Quimeras,&quot; which features the Paco Peña Flamenco Dance Company performing a story about immigrants from Africa arriving in Andalusia.

Peña has collaborated with the classical guitarist John Williams. Peña also provided the chapter on flamenco guitar for the book &quot;The Guitar (A Guide For Students And Teachers)&quot;.

<doc id="212378" wikidata="Q7905" url="?curid=212378" title="Lahn-Dill-Kreis">
<text>Lahn-Dill is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the west of Hesse, Germany. Neighboring districts are Siegen-Wittgenstein, Marburg-Biedenkopf, Gießen, Wetteraukreis, Hochtaunuskreis, Limburg-Weilburg, Westerwaldkreis.

==History==

The southern district belonged to the Princes of Solms-Braunfels and the Free Imperial City of Wetzlar. The latter had to give up its imperial freedom in 1803 as a result of the Imperial Deputation, then as the county of Wetzlar, in favor of the newly created Grand Duchy of Frankfurt of the prince primate (in the old empire Reichserzkanzler) Karl Theodor von Dalberg. The former Solmsian territories came to the Duchy of Nassau in 1806 and in 1815 also to Prussia in an exchange. In 1816, the Prussian districts of Wetzlar and Braunfels were created, which were united in 1822 to form the district of Wetzlar. The district belonged to the Prussian Rhine Province as an exclave until 1932. Since the Middle Ages, the northern part of the district belonged to the principality of Nassau-Dillenburg, which was part of the French-occupied Grand Duchy of Berg between 1806 and 1813, and to the principality of Nassau-Oranien between 1813 and 1815, which was absorbed into the Duchy of Nassau in 1816. This formed the two offices of Herborn and Dillenburg. After the Prussian annexation of the Duchy of Nassau in September 1866, both offices were united to form the Dillkreis.

After World War II, the entire district area as it is today became part of the state of Hesse. In the course of the territorial reform in Hesse, the Lahn-Dill district was formed on 1 January 1977. The new district consisted of

* the entire area of the dissolved Dillkreis with the cities of Dillenburg, Haiger and Herborn as well as the municipalities of Breitscheid, Dietzhölztal, Driedorf, Eschenburg, Greifenstein, Mittenaar, Siegbach and Sinn

* the largest part of the dissolved district of Giessen with the towns of Allendorf (Lumda), Grünberg, Hungen, Laubach, Lich, Linden and Staufenberg as well as the municipalities of Buseck, Fernwald, Langgöns, Lollar, Pohlheim, Rabenau and Reiskirchen

* part of the dissolved district of Wetzlar with the towns of Braunfels and Leun and the municipalities of Aßlar, Biebertal, Bischoffen (formerly Biedenkopf district), Ehringshausen, Hohenahr, Hüttenberg, Schöffengrund, Solms and Waldsolms.

The new district had an area of and included a total of 36 municipalities. The seat of the district administration became the simultaneously formed district-free city Lahn. This was created by uniting the district-free city of Giessen with the city of Wetzlar, 13 other municipalities from the district of Wetzlar and the municipality of Heuchelheim from the district of Giessen.

Due to strong protests, mainly from the people of Wetzlar, the territorial reform was partially reversed. As from 1 August 1979 the city of Lahn was dissolved again and the Lahn-Dill district was reorganized:

* The restored city of Wetzlar and the newly formed municipality of Lahnau were incorporated into the Lahn-Dill district.

* The municipality of Biebertal as well as all municipalities belonging to the district of Giessen until 1976 left the Lahn-Dill district and came to the newly established district of Giessen.

Since then, the Lahn-Dill district has comprised 23 towns and municipalities on an area of .

==Geography==
The main rivers of the district are the Lahn and the Dill, which also gave it the name. It is mountain landscape with the Westerwald in the west, the Taunus in the south, the Lahn-Dill-Bergland in the east and the Rothaargebirge of the Sauerland in the north. The highest elevation with is near Rittershausen (part of Dietzhölztal), the lowest with is in the Lahn valley in Biskirchen (part of the town of Leun).

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the imperial eagle in the top, a sign for the imperial city Wetzlar. The bottom part – taken from the arms of the previous Dillkreis – shows the lion of Nassau and the horn of the princes of Orange-Nassau, which later became the Dutch royal family. Dillenburg was the capital of the county of Nassau and later of Nassau-Orange.

<text>Meiobenthos, also called meiofauna, are small benthic invertebrates that live in marine or freshwater environments, or both. The term &quot;meiofauna&quot; loosely defines a group of organisms by their sizelarger than microfauna but smaller than macrofaunarather than by their taxonomy. This fauna includes both animals that turn into macrofauna later in life, and those small enough to belong to the meiobenthos their entire life. In marine environments there can be thousands of individuals in 10 cubic centimeters of sediment, and counts animals like nematodes, copepods, rotifers, tardigrades and ostracods, but protists like ciliates and foraminifers within the size range of the meiobenthos are also often included. In practice, the term usually includes organisms that can pass through a 1 mm mesh but are retained by a 45 μm mesh, though exact dimensions may vary. Whether an organism will pass through a 1 mm mesh also depends upon whether it is alive or dead at the time of sorting.

The term &quot;meiobenthos&quot; was first coined in 1942 by marine biologist Molly Mare, but organisms that fit into the modern meiofauna category have been studied since the 18th century.

==Meiofaunal taxa==


==Collecting the meiobenthos==
Meiofauna are most commonly encountered in sedimentary environments in both marine and freshwater environments, from the littoral to the deep-sea. They can also be found on hard substrates living on algae, the phytal environment, and sessile animals (barnacles, mussel beds, etc.).

===Sampling methodologies===
Sampling the meiobenthos is dependent upon the environment and whether quantitative or qualitative samples are required. In the sedimentary environment, the methodology used also depends on the physical morphology of the sediment. For qualititative sampling within the littoral zone, for both coarse and fine sediment, a bucket and spade will work. In the sub-littoral and deep water, some form of grab (like the Van Veen grab sampler) is required, although a fine mesh (about 0.25 mm or less) would work also.

For the quantitative sampling of sedimentary environments at all depths, a wide variety of samplers have been devised. The simplest is a plastic syringe with the end cut off to form a piston corer which can be deployed in the littoral zone, or in the sub-littoral using SCUBA gear. Generally the deeper the water, the more complicated the sampling process becomes. For sampling the meiofauna on hard substrates or phytal or epizootic environments, the only practical methodology is to cut or scrape off a known area of the substrate and place it in a plastic bag.

===Extraction methodologies===
There are a wide variety of methods for extracting meiofauna from the samples of their habitat depending upon whether live or fixed specimens are required. For extracting live meiofauna, one has to contend with the large number of species that cling or attach themselves to the substrate when disturbed. In order to get the meiofauna to release their grip, there are three methodologies available.

The first, and simplest, is osmotic shock, which is achieved by submerging the sample in fresh water for a few seconds (this only works for marine samples). This will cause the organisms to release, after which they can be shaken free from the substrate and filtered out through a 45 μm mesh and immediately returned to fresh filtered seawater. Many organisms will come through this process unharmed as long as the osmotic shock does not last too long.

The second methodology is the use of an anaesthetic. The preferred chemical solution for meiobenthologists is isotonic magnesium chloride (7.5g MgCl2·6H2O per 100 mL of distilled water). The sample is immersed in the isotonic solution and left for a period of 15 min, after which the meiofauna are shaken free of the substrate and again filtered out through a 45 μm mesh and immediately returned to fresh filtered seawater.

The third methodology is Uhlig&#x27;s seawater ice technique. This relies on the organisms moving ahead of a front of ice-cold seawater moving down through the sample, ultimately forcing them out of the sediment. It is most effective on samples from temperate and tropical regions.

For major studies where large numbers of samples are collected concurrently, samples are normally fixed using a 10% formalin solution, and the meiofauna are extracted at a later date. There are two main extraction methodologies. The first, decantation, works best with coarse sediments. Samples are shaken in an excess of water, the sediment is briefly allowed to settle, and then the meiofauna are filtered off. The second methodology, the flotation technique, works best with finer sediments, where the mass of the sediment particles is close to that of the meiofauna. The best solution for this technique is the colloidal silica Ludox. The sample is stirred into the Ludox solution and left to settle for 40 min, after which the meiofauna are filtered out. In fine sediments, extraction efficiency is improved with centrifugation. With both methodologies, repeated extractions should be made (at least three) with each sample to ensure that at least 95% of the meiofauna is extracted.

<text>Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon (; 17 October 1760 – 19 May 1825), better known as Henri de Saint-Simon (), was a French political, economic and socialist theorist and businessman whose thought had a substantial influence on politics, economics, sociology and the philosophy of science. He was a younger relative of the famous memoirist the Duc de Saint-Simon.

Saint-Simon created a political and economic ideology known as Saint-Simonianism that claimed that the needs of an &quot;industrial class&quot;, which he also referred to as the working class, needed to be recognized and fulfilled to have an effective society and an efficient economy. Unlike conceptions within industrializing societies of a working class being manual laborers alone, Saint-Simon&#x27;s late-18th-century conception of this class included all people engaged in what he saw as productive work that contributed to society, such as businesspeople, managers, scientists, bankers, and manual labourers, amongst others.

Saint-Simon believed the primary threat to the needs of the industrial class was what he defined as the &quot;idling class&quot;: a tier of society that included able-bodied persons who, instead of using their labor to benefit the social and economic orders, preferred what he perceived as a parasitic life of work avoidance. Saint-Simon stressed a three-pronged recognition of the merits of the individual, social hierarchy, and the wider economy, such as hierarchical, merit-based organizations of managers and scientists; those at the top of the hierarchies would be decision-makers in government. Saint-Simon strongly criticized any expansion of government intervention into the economy beyond ensuring productive working conditions and reducing idleness in society; he regarded intervention beyond these as too intrusive. Saint-Simon endorsed what critics have described as authoritarian or totalitarian means to achieve his goals, such as saying those who opposed his proposed reforms should be &quot;treated like cattle.&quot;

Saint-Simon&#x27;s conceptual recognition of the merits of broad socioeconomic contribution and Enlightenment-era valorization of scientific knowledge inspired and influenced utopian socialism, utilitarian political theorist John Stuart Mill, anarchism (through its founder, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon), and Marxism—Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels identified Saint-Simon as an inspiration for their ideas and classified him among the utopian socialists. Saint-Simon&#x27;s views also influenced 20th-century sociologist and economist Thorstein Veblen, including Veblen&#x27;s creation of institutional economics that has included prominent economists as adherents.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Henri de Saint-Simon was born in Paris as a French aristocrat, the son of Balthazar Henri de Rouvroy de Saint-Simon, Marquis de Sandricourt (1721-1783) and his wife and cousin, Blanche Isabelle de Rouvroy de Saint-Simon (b. 1737), lady-in-waiting of Marie Joséphine of Savoy, Countess of Provence. His grandfather&#x27;s cousin had been the Duke of Saint-Simon. His younger sister Marie Louise de Rouvroy de Saint-Simon (1763-1834) was mother-in-law of Princess Maria Christina of Saxony, Dowager Princess of Carignano.

From his youth, Saint-Simon was highly ambitious. He ordered his valet to wake him every morning with, &quot;Remember, monsieur le comte, that you have great things to do.&quot; Among his early schemes was one to connect the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans by a canal, and another to construct a canal from Madrid to the sea.

During the American Revolution, Saint-Simon joined the Americans, believing that their revolution signaled the beginning of a new era. He fought alongside the Marquis de Lafayette between 1779 and 1783, and took part in the siege of Yorktown under the command of General George Washington. Saint-Simon was captured and imprisoned by British forces during the end of his service, and upon his release, returned to France to study engineering and hydraulics at the Ecole de Mézières.

At the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, Saint-Simon quickly endorsed the revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity. In the early years of the revolution, Saint-Simon devoted himself to organizing a large industrial structure in order to found a scientific school of improvement. He needed to raise some funds to achieve his objectives, which he did by land speculation. This was only possible in the first few years of the revolution because of the growing instability of the political situation in France, which prevented him from continuing his financial activities and indeed put his life at risk. Saint-Simon and Talleyrand planned to profiteer during the Terror by buying the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, stripping its roof of metal, and selling the metal for scrap. Saint-Simon was imprisoned on suspicion of engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. He was released in 1794 at the end of the Terror. After he recovered his freedom, Saint-Simon found himself immensely rich due to currency depreciation, but his fortune was subsequently stolen by his business partner. Thenceforth he decided to devote himself to political studies and research. After the establishment of the Ecole Polytechnique in 1794, a school established to train young men in the arts of sciences and industry and funded by the state, Saint-Simon became involved with the new school.

===Life as a working adult===
When he was nearly 40 he went through a varied course of study and experiment to enlarge and clarify his view of things. One of these experiments was an unhappy marriage in 1801 to Alexandrine-Sophie Goury de Champgrand, undertaken so that he might have a literary salon. After a year, the marriage was dissolved by mutual consent. The result of his experiments was that he found himself completely impoverished, and lived in penury for the remainder of his life. The first of his numerous writings, mostly scientific and political, was &quot;Lettres d&#x27;un habitant de Genève&quot;, which appeared in 1802. In this first work, he called for the creation of a religion of science with Isaac Newton as a saint. 

Saint-Simon&#x27;s earliest publications, such as his &quot;Introduction aux travaux scientifiques du XIXe siècle (Introduction to scientific discoveries of the 19th century&quot; (1803) and his &quot;Mémoire sur la science de l&#x27;homme (Notes on the study of man)&quot; (1813), (the latter of which is a eulogy to Napoleon), demonstrate his faith in science as a means to regenerate society.

A few years into his writing career, Saint-Simon found himself ruined and was forced to work for a living. After a few attempts to recover his money from his former partner, he received financial support from Diard, a former employee, and was able to publish in 1807 his second book, &quot;Introduction aux travaux scientifiques du XIX siècle&quot;. Diard died in 1810 and Saint-Simon found himself poor again, and this time also in poor health. He was sent to a sanatorium in 1813, but with financial help from relatives, he had time to recover his health and gain some intellectual recognition in Europe. In February 1821 &quot;Du système industriel&quot; appeared, and in 1823–1824 &quot;Catéchisme des industriels&quot;.

Around 1814 he wrote the essay &quot;On Reconstruction of the European Community&quot; and sent it to the Congress of Vienna. He proposed a European kingdom, building on France and the United Kingdom.

For his last decade, Saint-Simon concentrated on themes of political economy. Together with Auguste Comte, (then only a teenager), Saint-Simon projected a society bypassing the changes of the French Revolution, in which science and industry would take the moral and temporal power of medieval theocracy. In his last work however, &quot;Le Nouveau Christianisme (The New Christianity)&quot; (1825), Saint-Simon reverted to more traditional ideas of renewing society through Christian brotherly love. He died shortly after its publication.

===Suicide attempt===
On March 9, 1823, disappointed by the lack of results of his writing (he had hoped they would guide society towards social improvement), he attempted suicide in despair. Remarkably, he shot himself in the head six times without succeeding, losing his sight in one eye.

=== Death ===
He died on 19 May 1825 and was buried in Le Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France.

==Ideas==
===Industrialism===

In 1817 Saint-Simon published a manifesto called the &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot; in his work titled &quot;L&#x27;Industrie&quot; (&quot;Industry&quot;). The declaration was about the principles of an ideology called industrialism that called for the creation of an industrial society led by people within what he defined as the industrial class. The industrial class, also referred to as the working class, was defined as including all people engaged in productive work that contributed to society, emphasizing scientists and industrialists, but including engineers, businesspeople, managers, bankers, manual workers, and others.

Saint-Simon said the primary threat to the needs of the industrial class was another class he referred to as the idling class, which included able people who preferred to be parasitic and benefit from the work of others while seeking to avoid doing work. He saw the origins of this parasitic activity by idlers in what he regarded as the natural laziness of humanity. He believed the principal economic roles of government were to ensure that productive activity in the economy is unhindered and to reduce idleness in society.

In the Declaration, Saint-Simon strongly criticized any expansion of government intervention into the economy beyond these two principal economic roles, saying that when the government goes beyond these roles, it becomes a &quot;tyrannical enemy of industry&quot; and that the industrial economy will decline as a consequence of such excessive government intervention. Saint-Simon stressed the need for recognition of the merit of the individual and the need for hierarchy of merit in society and in the economy, such as society having hierarchical merit-based organizations of managers and scientists to be the decision-makers in government. His views were radical for his time. He built on Enlightenment ideas which challenged church doctrine and the older regime with the idea of progress from industry and science

Heavily influenced by the absence of social privilege he saw in the early United States, Saint-Simon renounced his aristocratic title and came to favor a form of meritocracy, becoming convinced that science was the key to progress and that it would be possible to develop a society based on objective scientific principles. He claimed that feudal society in France and elsewhere needed to be dissolved and transformed into an industrial society. As such, he invented the conception of the industrial society.

Saint-Simon&#x27;s economic views and ideas were influenced by Adam Smith whom Saint-Simon deeply admired, and referred to him in praise as &quot;the immortal Adam Smith&quot;. He shared with Smith the belief that taxes needed to be much reduced from what they were then in order to have a more just industrial system. Saint-Simon desired the minimization of government intervention into the economy to prevent disruption of productive work. He emphasized more emphatically than Smith that state administration of the economy was generally parasitic and hostile to the needs of production. Like Adam Smith, Saint-Simon&#x27;s model of society emulated the scientific methods of astronomy, and said &quot;The astronomers only accepted those facts which were verified by observation; they chose the system which linked them best, and since that time, they have never led science astray.&quot;.

Saint-Simon reviewed the French Revolution and regarded it as an upheaval driven by economic change and class conflict. In his analysis, he believed that the solution to the problems that led to the French Revolution would be the creation of an industrial society, where a hierarchy of merit and respect for productive work would be the basis of society, while ranks of hereditary and military hierarchy would lessen in importance in society because they were not capable to lead a productive society.

===Racial views===
Saint-Simon believed that Europeans were superior. In the work &quot;De la réorganization de la société européenne&quot;, written with Augustin Thierry and published in 1814, Saint-Simon advocated that the united Europe which he envisioned should try to colonize the rest of the world: &quot;To colonize the world with the European race, which is superior to every other race: to make the world accessible and habitable like Europe—such is the sort of enterprise by which the European Parliament should continually keep Europe active and happy.&quot; Writing in &quot;Introduction aux œuvres scientifiques du XIXe siècle&quot;, Saint-Simon states that he does not believe negroes to be equal to the Europeans for physiological reasons. In &quot;Lettres&quot;, he writes: &quot;The revolutionaries applied the principles of equality to negroes. If they had consulted the physiologists they would have learned that the negro, because of his basic physical structure, is not susceptible, even with the same education, of rising to the intellectual level of Europeans.&quot; Jan Eijking writes that &quot;Saint-Simon&#x27;s understanding of a neutral, technocratic international sphere took existing social, economic, and racial hierarchies for granted&quot;.

===Religious views===
Prior to the publication of the &quot;Nouveau Christianisme&quot;, Saint-Simon had not concerned himself with theology. In &quot;Nouveau Christianisme&quot;, Saint-Simon presupposes a belief in God; his object in the treatise is to reduce Christianity to its simple and essential elements. He does this by clearing it of what he thought to be the dogmas and other defects that had come to define the Catholic and Protestant forms of Christianity. Saint-Simon posited a comprehensive formula for a &quot;new Christianity&quot;: &quot;The whole of society ought to strive towards the amelioration of the moral and physical existence of the poorest class; society ought to organize itself in the way best adapted for attaining this end.&quot;

==Influence==

Saint-Simon&#x27;s thought exerted significant influence upon French and European technocratic thought, the development of technocratic internationalism, as well as major industrial and financial projects including the Suez Canal, the Channel Tunnel, the Crédit Mobilier, and the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée. Following Saint-Simon&#x27;s death in 1825, his followers began to differ as to how to promulgate his ideas. The most acclaimed disciple of Saint-Simon was Auguste Comte.

In 1831 Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin and Amand Bazard purchased the newspaper &quot;Le Globe&quot; as the official organ for their revolutionary fraternity &quot;Friends of the Truth&quot;. Initially both men were supposed to be co-leaders naming themselves &quot;Supreme Fathers&quot;. However, Bazard left the group as it became increasingly ritualistic and religiously minded with Enfantin founding a community at Ménilmontant where he decried marriage as tyranny, promoted free love, declared himself &quot;chosen by God&quot;, and began predicting that a &quot;female Messiah&quot; would soon save humanity. Enfantin would go on to organize an expedition of the disciples to Constantinople, and then to Egypt, where he influenced the creation of the Suez Canal.

Gustave d&#x27;Eichthal was a sympathiser of the Saint-Simonian movement who developed Saint-Simonian notions practically and involved himself in the development of the French economy, founding a number of leading concerns including the Suez Canal Company, founded by Saint-Simonian sympathiser Ferdinand de Lesseps, and the bank Crédit Mobilier, which was established by the Pereire brothers who had been members of the Saint-Simonian movement. It has also been noted that Saint-Simonian ideas exerted a significant influence on new religious movements such as Spiritualism and Occultism since the 1850s. Karl Marx considered the Saint-Simonians to be the &quot;patriarchs of socialism.&quot;

French feminist and socialist writer Flora Tristan (1803–1844) claimed that Mary Wollstonecraft, author of &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;, anticipated Saint-Simon&#x27;s ideas by a generation.

Karl Marx identified Saint-Simon as being among whom he called the &quot;utopian socialists&quot;, though historian Alan Ryan regards certain followers of Saint-Simon, rather than Saint-Simon himself, as being responsible for the rise of utopian socialism that based itself upon Saint-Simon&#x27;s ideas. Ryan also distinguishes between Saint-Simon&#x27;s conceptions and Marxism&#x27;s, as Saint-Simon did not promote independent working-class organization and leadership as a solution to capitalist societal problems, nor did he adhere to the Marxist definition of the working class as excluded by fundamental private property law from control over the means of production. Unlike Marx, Saint-Simon did not regard class relations, with respect to the means of production, to be an engine of socio-economic dynamics but rather the form of management. Furthermore, Saint-Simon was not critical of capitalists as exclusive owners, collaborators, controllers, and decision-makers. Rather, he regarded capitalists as an important component of the &quot;industrial class.&quot; Ryan further suggests that by the 1950s it was clear that Saint-Simon had presaged the &quot;modern&quot; understanding of industrial society. Economist Don Lavoie described Saint-Simon as part of an authoritarian current in socialist thought, by promoting a &quot;deliberate reconstruction of society&quot; which was &quot;comprehensively planed&quot; and which, which by necessity, required mass compulsion to achieve its goals.

According to Fr. Cyril Martindale, Robert Hugh Benson got the idea of his dystopian science fiction novel about the Antichrist, published in 1908 as &quot;Lord of the World&quot;, from his friend and literary mentor Frederick Rolfe, who also introduced Monsignor Benson to the writings of Saint-Simon. According to Fr. Martindale, as Benson read Saint-Simon&#x27;s writings, &quot;A vision of a dechristianised civilisation, sprung from the wrecking of the french Ancien régime, arose before him and he listened to Mr. Rolfe&#x27;s suggestion that he should write a book on Antichrist.&quot;

<text>The tilde (, also ) is a grapheme or with a number of uses. The name of the character came into English from Spanish , which in turn came from the Latin , meaning &#x27;title&#x27; or &#x27;superscription&#x27;. Its primary use is as a diacritic (accent) in combination with a base letter. Its freestanding form is used in modern texts mainly to indicate approximation.

==History==

===Use by medieval scribes===

The tilde was originally one of a variety of marks written over an omitted letter or several letters as a scribal abbreviation (a &quot;mark of contraction&quot;). Thus, the commonly used words &quot;Anno Domini&quot; were frequently abbreviated to &quot;Ao Dñi&quot;, with an elevated terminal with a contraction mark placed over the &quot;n&quot;. Such a mark could denote the omission of one letter or several letters. This saved on the expense of the scribe&#x27;s labor and the cost of vellum and ink. Medieval European charters written in Latin are largely made up of such abbreviated words with contraction marks and other abbreviations; only uncommon words were given in full.

The text of the Domesday Book of 1086, relating for example, to the manor of Molland in Devon (see adjacent picture), is highly abbreviated as indicated by numerous tildes.

The text with abbreviations expanded is as follows:
:

===Role of mechanical typewriters===


On typewriters designed for languages that routinely use diacritics (accent marks), there are two possible solutions. Keys can be dedicated to precomposed characters or alternatively a dead key mechanism can be provided. With the latter, a mark is made when a dead key is typed, but unlike normal keys, the paper carriage does not move on and thus the next letter to be typed is printed under that accent. Typewriters for Spanish typically have a dedicated key for Ñ/ñ but, as Portuguese uses Ã/ã and Õ/õ, a single dead-key (rather than take two keys to dedicate) is the most practical solution.

The tilde symbol did not exist independently as a movable type or hot-lead printing character since the type cases for Spanish or Portuguese would include sorts for the accented forms.

===The centralized ASCII tilde ===

The first ASCII standard (X3.64-1963) did not have a tilde. Like Portuguese and Spanish, the French, German and Scandinavian languages also needed symbols in excess of the basic 26 needed for English. The ASA worked with and through the CCITT to internationalize the code-set, to meet the basic needs of at least the Western European languages.
Thus ISO646 was born (and the ASCII standard updated to X3.64-1967), providing the tilde and other symbols as optional characters.

ISO646 and ASCII incorporated many of the overprinting lower-case diacritics from typewriters, including tilde. Overprinting was intended to work by putting a backspace code between the codes for letter and diacritic. 

The free-standing tilde is at code 126 in ASCII, where it was inherited into Unicode as U+007E.

A similar shaped mark () is known in typography and lexicography as a swung dash: these are used in dictionaries to indicate the omission of the entry word.

===Connection to Spanish===

As indicated by the etymological origin of the word &quot;tilde&quot; in English, this symbol has been closely associated with the Spanish language. The connection stems from the use of the tilde above the letter to form the (different) letter in Spanish, a feature shared by only a few other languages, most of which are historically connected to Spanish. This peculiarity can help non-native speakers quickly identify a text as being written in Spanish with little chance of error. Particularly during the 1990s, Spanish-speaking intellectuals and news outlets demonstrated support for the language and the culture by defending this letter against globalisation and computerisation trends that threatened to remove it from keyboards and other standardised products and codes. The Instituto Cervantes, founded by Spain&#x27;s government to promote the Spanish language internationally, chose as its logo a highly stylised with a large tilde. The 24-hour news channel CNN in the US later adopted a similar strategy on its existing logo for the launch of its Spanish-language version, therefore being written as CN͠N. And similarly to the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Spain men&#x27;s national basketball team is nicknamed &quot;ÑBA&quot;.

In Spanish itself the word is used more generally for diacritics, including the stress-marking acute accent. The diacritic is more commonly called or , and is not considered an accent mark in Spanish, but rather simply a part of the letter (much like the dot over makes an character that is familiar to readers of English).

==Usage==
=== Letters with tilde ===
Unicode encodes a number of cases of &quot;letter with tilde&quot; as precomposed characters and these are displayed below. In addition, many more symbols may be composed using the combining character facility (, and others) that may be used with any letter or other diacritic to create a customised symbol but this does not mean that the result has any real-world application and are not shown in the table. 

A tilde diacritic can be added to almost any character by using a combining tilde. Greek and Cyrillic letters with tilde (Α͂ᾶ, Η͂ῆ, Ι͂ῖ, ῗ, Υ͂ῦ, ῧ and А̃а̃, Ә̃ ә̃, Е̃е̃, И̃и̃, О̃о̃, У̃у̃, Ј̃j̃) are formed using this method.

===Common use in English===

The English language does not use the tilde as a diacritic, though it is used in some loanwords. The standalone form of the symbol is used more widely. Informally, it means &quot;approximately&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, or &quot;around&quot;, such as &quot;~30 minutes before&quot;, meaning &quot;&quot;approximately&quot; 30 minutes before&quot;. It may also mean &quot;similar to&quot;, including &quot;of the same order of magnitude as&quot;, such as &quot;&quot; meaning that and are of the same order of magnitude. Another approximation symbol is the double tilde , meaning &quot;approximately/almost equal to&quot;. The tilde is also used to indicate congruence of shapes by placing it over an symbol, thus .

In more recent digital usage, tildes on either side of a word or phrase have sometimes come to convey a particular tone that &quot;let[s] the enclosed words perform both sincerity and irony&quot;, which can pre-emptively defuse a negative reaction. For example, BuzzFeed journalist Joseph Bernstein interprets the tildes in the following tweet:
:&quot;in the ~ spirit of the season ~ will now link to some of the (imho) #Bestof2014 sports reads. if you hate nice things, mute that hashtag.&quot;
as a way of making it clear that both the author and reader are aware that the enclosed phrase – &quot;spirit of the season&quot; – &quot;is cliche and we know this quality is beneath our author, and we don&#x27;t want you to think our author is a cliche person generally&quot;.

Among other uses, the symbol has been used on social media to indicate sarcasm. It may also be used online, especially in informal writing such as fanfiction, to convey a cutesy, playful, or flirtatious tone.
===Diacritical use===
In some languages, the tilde is a diacritic mark placed over a letter to indicate a change in its pronunciation:

====Pitch====
The tilde was firstly used in the polytonic orthography of Ancient Greek, as a variant of the circumflex, representing a rise in pitch followed by a return to standard pitch.

====Abbreviation====

Later, it was used to make abbreviations in medieval Latin documents. When an or followed a vowel, it was often omitted, and a tilde (physically, a small ) was placed over the preceding vowel to indicate the missing letter; this is the origin of the use of tilde to indicate nasalization (compare the development of the umlaut as an abbreviation of .) A tilde represented an omitted or a syllable containing it. The practice of using the tilde over a vowel to indicate omission of an or continued in printed books in French as a means of reducing text length until the 17th century. It was also used in Portuguese and Spanish.

The tilde was also used occasionally to make other abbreviations, such as over the letter , making , (&quot;that&quot;). It also appears for &quot;qua&quot; and together with the letter to form for &quot;pra&quot;.

====Nasalization====
It is also as a small that the tilde originated when written above other letters, marking a Latin which had been elided in old Galician-Portuguese. In modern Portuguese it indicates nasalization of the base vowel: &quot;hand&quot;, from Lat. &quot;manu-&quot;; &quot;reasons&quot;, from Lat. . This usage has been adopted in the orthographies of several native languages of South America, such as Guarani and Nheengatu, as well as in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and many other phonetic alphabets. For example, is the IPA transcription of the pronunciation of the French place-name &quot;Lyon&quot;.

In Breton, the symbol after a vowel means that the letter serves only to give the vowel a nasalised pronunciation, without being itself pronounced, as it normally is. For example, gives the pronunciation whereas gives .

In the DMG romanization of Tunisian Arabic, the tilde is used for nasal vowels õ and ṏ.

====Palatal n====

The tilded (, ) developed from the digraph in Spanish. In this language, is considered a separate letter called &quot;eñe&quot; (), rather than a letter-diacritic combination; it is placed in Spanish dictionaries between the letters and . In Spanish, the word &quot;tilde&quot; actually refers to diacritics in general, e.g. the acute accent in &quot;José&quot;, while the diacritic in is called &quot;virgulilla&quot; () (yeísta) or () (non-yeísta). Current languages in which the tilded () is used for the palatal nasal consonant include

* Asturian
* Aymara
* Basque
* Chamorro
* Filipino
* Galician
* Guaraní
* Iñupiaq
* Mapudungun
* Papiamento
* Quechua
* Spanish
* Tetum
* Wolof
====Tone====
In Vietnamese, a tilde over a vowel represents a creaky rising tone (&quot;ngã&quot;). Letters with the tilde are not considered separate letters of the Vietnamese alphabet.

====International Phonetic Alphabet====

In phonetics, a tilde is used as a diacritic that is placed above a letter, below it or superimposed onto the middle of it:

* A tilde above a letter indicates nasalization, e.g. .
* A tilde superimposed onto the middle of a letter indicates velarization or pharyngealization, e.g. . If no precomposed Unicode character exists, the Unicode character can be used to generate one.
* A tilde below a letter indicates laryngealisation, e.g. . If no precomposed Unicode character exists, the Unicode character can be used to generate one.

A tilde between two phonemes indicates optionality, or &quot;alternates with&quot;. E.g. could indicate that the sounds may alternate depending on context (free variation), or that they vary based on region or speaker, or some other variation.

====Letter extension====
In Estonian, the symbol stands for the close-mid back unrounded vowel, and it is considered an independent letter.

====Other uses====
Some languages and alphabets use the tilde for other purposes, such as:
* Arabic script: A symbol resembling the tilde () is used over the letter () to become , denoting a long sound.
* Guaraní: The tilded (note that with tilde is not available as a precomposed glyph in Unicode) stands for the velar nasal consonant. Also, the tilded () stands for the nasalized upper central rounded vowel . Munduruku, Parintintín, and two older spellings of Filipino words also use .
* Syriac script: A tilde (~) under the letter &quot;Kaph&quot; represents a sound, transliterated as &quot;ch&quot; or &quot;č&quot;.
* Estonian and Võro use the tilde above the letter o (õ) to indicate the vowel , a rare sound among languages.
* Unicode has a combining vertical tilde character: . It is used to indicate middle tone in linguistic transcription of certain dialects of the Lithuanian language, and was also used historically in the letter х̾, which was part of the Polish Cyrillic alphabet of the late 19th century.
* Resurrección María de Azkue&#x27;s 1906 Basque dictionary used an idiosyncratic spelling including .

===Punctuation===
The tilde is used in various ways in punctuation, including In some languages (such as in French), a tilde or a tilde-like wave dash (Unicode: ) may be used as a punctuation mark (instead of an unspaced hyphen, en dash or em dash) between two numbers, to indicate a range. Doing so avoids the risk of confusion with subtraction or a hyphenated number (such as a part number or model number). For example, &quot;12~15&quot; means &quot;12 to 15&quot;, &quot;~3&quot; means &quot;up to three&quot;, and &quot;100~&quot; means &quot;100 and greater&quot;. East Asian languages almost always use this convention, but it is sometimes done for clarity in some other languages as well. Chinese uses the wave dash and full-width em dash interchangeably for this purpose. In English, the tilde is often used to express ranges and model numbers in electronics, but rarely in formal grammar or in type-set documents, as a wavy dash preceding a number sometimes represents an approximation (see below).

The range tilde is used for various purposes in French, but only to denote ranges of numbers (e.g., &quot; means &quot;21 to 32 degrees Celsius&quot;)

(The symbol (a double tilde) is also used in French, for example, means &quot;approximately 400 meters&quot;.)

==== Approximation ====

Before a number the tilde can mean &#x27;approximately&#x27;; &#x27;~42&#x27; means &#x27;approximately 42&#x27;. When used with currency symbols that precede the number (national conventions differ), the tilde precedes the symbol, thus for example &#x27;~$10&#x27; means &#x27;about ten dollars&#x27;.

The symbols ≈ (almost equal to) and ≅ (approximately equal to) are among the other symbols used to express approximation.

====Japanese====
The is used for various purposes in Japanese, including to denote ranges of numbers (e.g., &quot;5〜10&quot; means between 5 and 10) in place of dashes or brackets, and to indicate origin. The wave dash is also used to separate a title and a subtitle in the same line, as a colon is used in English.

When used in conversations via email or instant messenger it may be used as a sarcasm mark .

The sign is used as a replacement for the , katakana character, in Japanese, extending the final syllable.

=====Unicode and Shift JIS encoding of wave dash=====

In practice the (Unicode ), is often used instead of the (Unicode ), because the Shift JIS code for the wave dash, 0x8160, which should be mapped to U+301C, is instead mapped to U+FF5E in Windows code page 932 (Microsoft&#x27;s code page for Japanese), a widely used extension of Shift JIS.

This decision avoided a shape definition error in the original (6.2) Unicode code charts: the wave dash reference glyph in JIS / Shift JIS matches the Unicode reference glyph for U+FF5E , while the original reference glyph for U+301C was reflected, incorrectly, when Unicode imported the JIS wave dash. In other platforms such as the classic Mac OS and macOS, 0x8160 is correctly mapped to U+301C. It is generally difficult, if not impossible, for users of Japanese Windows to type U+301C, especially in legacy, non-Unicode applications.

A similar situation exists regarding the Korean KS X 1001 character set, in which Microsoft maps the EUC-KR or UHC code for the wave dash (0xA1AD) to , while IBM and Apple map it to U+301C. Microsoft also uses U+FF5E to map the KS X 1001 raised tilde (0xA2A6), while Apple uses .

The current Unicode reference glyph for U+301C has been corrected to match the JIS standard in response to a 2014 proposal, which noted that while the existing Unicode reference glyph had been matched by fonts from the discontinued Windows XP, all other major platforms including later versions of Microsoft Windows shipped with fonts matching the JIS reference glyph for U+301C.

The JIS / Shift JIS wave dash is still formally mapped to U+301C as of JIS X 0213, whereas the WHATWG Encoding Standard used by HTML5 follows Microsoft in mapping 0x8160 to U+FF5E. These two code points have a similar or identical glyph in several fonts, reducing the confusion and incompatibility.

====Chinese====

WeChat users frequently replace final punctuations with tildes in messages. An analysis of such &quot;innovative uses&quot; of tildes found that final tildes are most used to make the message friendlier and polite. They make expressives more sincere and directives less abrupt. Less commonly, final tildes imply sounds, i.e. otomatopeas and sound extensions. This use is compared to &quot;sajiao&quot; (), a child-like acting seen in East Asian cultures that are also vocalized by raising or extending tone.

===Mathematics===

====As a unary operator====
A tilde in front of a single quantity can mean &quot;approximately&quot;, &quot;about&quot; or &quot;of the same order of magnitude as.&quot;

In written mathematical logic, the tilde represents negation: &quot;~&quot;p&quot;&quot; means &quot;not &quot;p&quot;, where &quot;p&quot;&quot; is a proposition. Modern use often replaces the tilde with the negation symbol (¬) for this purpose, to avoid confusion with equivalence relations.

====As a relational operator====

In mathematics, the tilde operator (which can be represented by a tilde or the dedicated character ), sometimes called &quot;twiddle&quot;, is often used to denote an equivalence relation between two objects. Thus &quot;&quot; means &quot; is equivalent to &quot;. It is a weaker statement than stating that equals . The expression &quot;&quot; is sometimes read aloud as &quot; twiddles &quot;, perhaps as an analogue to the verbal expression of &quot;&quot;.

The tilde can indicate approximate equality in a variety of ways. It can be used to denote the asymptotic equality of two functions. For example, means that formula_1.

A tilde is also used to indicate &quot;approximately equal to&quot; (e.g. 1.902 ~= 2). This usage probably developed as a typed alternative to the libra symbol used for the same purpose in written mathematics, which is an equal sign with the upper bar replaced by a bar with an upward hump, bump, or loop in the middle (︍︍♎︎) or, sometimes, a tilde (≃). The symbol &quot;≈&quot; is also used for this purpose.

In physics and astronomy, a tilde can be used between two expressions (e.g. ) to state that the two are of the same order of magnitude.

In statistics and probability theory, the tilde means &quot;is distributed as&quot;; see random variable (e.g. for a binomial distribution).

A tilde can also be used to represent geometric similarity (e.g. , meaning triangle is similar to ). A triple tilde (≋) is often used to show congruence, an equivalence relation in geometry.

In graph theory, the tilde can be used to represent adjacency between vertices. The edge formula_2 connects vertices formula_3 and formula_4 which can be said to be adjacent, and this adjacency can be denoted formula_5.

====As a diacritic====

The symbol &quot;formula_6&quot; is pronounced as &quot;eff tilde&quot; or, informally, as &quot;eff twiddle&quot;. This can be used to denote the Fourier transform of &quot;f&quot;, or a lift of &quot;f&quot;, and can have a variety of other meanings depending on the context.

A tilde placed below a letter in mathematics can represent a vector quantity (e.g. formula_7).

In statistics and probability theory, a tilde placed on top of a variable is sometimes used to represent the median of that variable; thus formula_8 would indicate the median of the variable formula_9. A tilde over the letter n (formula_10) is sometimes used to indicate the harmonic mean.

In machine learning, a tilde may represent a candidate value for a cell state in GRUs or LSTM units. (e.g. c̃)

===Physics===
Often in physics, one can consider an equilibrium solution to an equation, and then a perturbation to that equilibrium. For the variables in the original equation (for instance formula_11) a substitution formula_12 can be made, where formula_3 is the equilibrium part and formula_14 is the perturbed part.

A tilde is also used in particle physics to denote the hypothetical supersymmetric partner. For example, an electron is referred to by the letter &quot;e&quot;, and its superpartner the selectron is written &quot;ẽ&quot;.

In multibody mechanics, the tilde operator maps three-dimensional vectors formula_15 to skew-symmetrical matrices formula_16 (see or ).

===Economics===
For relations involving preference, economists sometimes use the tilde to represent indifference between two or more bundles of goods. For example, to say that a consumer is indifferent between bundles &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, an economist would write &quot;x&quot; ~ &quot;y&quot;.

===Electronics===
It can approximate the sine wave symbol (∿, U+223F), which is used in electronics to indicate alternating current, in place of +, −, or ⎓ for direct current.

===Linguistics===
The tilde may indicate alternating allomorphs or morphological alternation, as in for &quot;kneel~knelt&quot; (the plus sign &#x27;+&#x27; indicates a morpheme boundary).

The tilde may represent some sort of phonetic or phonemic variation between two sounds, which might be allophones or in free variation. For example, can represent &quot;either or &quot;.

In formal semantics, it is also used as a notation for the &quot;squiggle operator&quot; which plays a key role in many theories of focus.

===Computing===

Computer programmers use the tilde in various ways and sometimes call the symbol (as opposed to the diacritic) a squiggle, squiggly, swiggle, or twiddle. According to the Jargon File, other synonyms sometimes used in programming include not, approx, wiggle, enyay (after &quot;eñe&quot;) and (humorously) sqiggle .

==== Directories and URLs ====
On Unix-like operating systems (including AIX, BSD, Linux and macOS), tilde normally indicates the current user&#x27;s home directory. For example, if the current user&#x27;s home directory is , then the command is equivalent to , , or . This convention derives from the Lear-Siegler ADM-3A terminal in common use during the 1970s, which happened to have the tilde symbol and the word &quot;Home&quot; (for moving the cursor to the upper left) on the same key. When prepended to a particular username, the tilde indicates that user&#x27;s home directory (e.g., for the home directory of user , such as ).

Used in URLs on the World Wide Web, it often denotes a personal website on a Unix-based server. For example, might be the personal website of John Doe. This mimics the Unix shell usage of the tilde. However, when accessed from the web, file access is usually directed to a subdirectory in the user&#x27;s home directory, such as or .

In URLs, the characters (or ) may substitute for a tilde if an input device lacks a tilde key. Thus, and will behave in the same manner.

==== Computer languages ====
=====Regex=====
The tilde is used in the AWK programming language as part of the pattern match operators for regular expressions:
*codice_1 returns true if the variable is matched.
*codice_2 returns false if the variable is matched.

The operators are also used in the SQL variant of the database PostgreSQL.

A variant of this, with the plain tilde replaced with codice_3, was adopted in Perl. Ruby also uses this variant without the negated operator.

In APL and MATLAB, tilde represents the monadic logical function NOT. and in APL it additionally represents the dyadic multiset function &quot;without&quot; (set difference).

In C the tilde character is used as bitwise NOT unary operator, following the notation in logic (an codice_4 causes a logical NOT, instead). This is also used by many languages based on or influenced by C, such as C++, C#, D, Java, Perl, PHP, and Python. The MySQL database also use tilde as bitwise invert as does Microsoft&#x27;s SQL Server Transact-SQL (T-SQL) language.

 JavaScript also uses tilde as bitwise NOT. Because bitwise operators work on integers, and numbers in JavaScript are 64 bit floating point numbers, the operator converts numbers to a 32-bit signed integer before it performing the negation. The conversion truncates the fractional part and most significant bits. This lets two tildes codice_5 to be used as a short syntax to cast to integer. However, it is not recommended as use for truncation. In contrast, it does not truncate BigInts, which are arbitrarily large integers.

In C++ and C#, the tilde is also used as the first character in a class&#x27;s method name (where the rest of the name must be the same name as the class) to indicate a destructor – a special method which is called at the end of the object&#x27;s life.

In ASP.NET applications, tilde (&#x27;~&#x27;) is used as a shortcut to the root of the application&#x27;s virtual directory.

In the CSS stylesheet language, the tilde finds the element selected by the right-hand side that shares the parent with an element selected by the left-hand side.

In the D programming language, the tilde is used as bitwise not operator, concatenation operator such as those of arrays, and to indicate an object destructor. Tilde operator can be overloaded for user types, and binary tilde operator is mostly used to merging two objects, or adding some objects to set of objects. It was introduced because plus operator can have different meaning in many situations. For example, &quot;120&quot; + &quot;14&quot; may produce &quot;134&quot; (addition of two numbers), &quot;12014&quot; (concatenation of strings), or something else. D disallows + operator for arrays (and strings), and provides separate operator for concatenation (similarly PHP programming language solved this problem by using dot operator for concatenation, and + for number addition, which will also work on strings containing numbers).

In Eiffel, the tilde is used for object comparison. If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; denote objects, the Boolean expression &quot;a&quot; ~ &quot;b&quot; has value true if and only if these objects are equal, as defined by the applicable version of the library routine &quot;is_equal&quot;, which by default denotes field-by-field object equality but can be redefined in any class to support a specific notion of equality. If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are references, the object equality expression &quot;a&quot; ~ &quot;b&quot; is to be contrasted with &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; which denotes reference equality. Unlike the call &quot;a&quot;.&quot;is_equal&quot; (&quot;b&quot;), the expression &quot;a&quot; ~ &quot;b&quot; is type-safe even in the presence of covariance.

In the Apache Groovy programming language the tilde character is used as an operator mapped to the bitwiseNegate() method. Given a String the method will produce a java.util.regex.Pattern. Given an integer it will negate the integer bitwise like in C. codice_3 and codice_7 can in Groovy be used to match a regular expression.

In Haskell, the tilde is used in type constraints to indicate type equality. Also, in pattern-matching, the tilde is used to indicate a lazy pattern match.

In the Inform 6 programming language, the tilde is used to indicate a quotation mark inside a quoted string. Tilde itself is created by codice_8.
In &quot;text mode&quot; of the LaTeX typesetting language a tilde diacritic can be obtained using, e.g., codice_9, yielding &quot;ñ&quot;. A stand-alone tilde can be obtained by using codice_10 or codice_11.
In &quot;math mode&quot; a tilde diacritic can be written as, e.g., codice_12. For a wider tilde codice_13 can be used. The codice_14 command produce a tilde-like binary relation symbol that is often used in mathematical expressions, and the double-tilde ≈ is obtained with codice_15. The codice_16 package also supports entering tildes directly, e.g., codice_17.
In both text and math mode, a tilde on its own (codice_18) renders a white space with no line breaking.

In MediaWiki syntax, four tildes are a shortcut for a user&#x27;s signature. Three and five tildes puts the signature without timestamp and only the timestamp, respectively.

In Common Lisp, the tilde is used as the prefix for format specifiers in format strings.

In Max/MSP, MSP objects have names ending with a tilde. MSP objects process at the computer&#x27;s sampling rate and mainly deal with sound.

In Standard ML, the tilde is used as the prefix for negative numbers and as the unary negation operator.

In OCaml, the tilde is used to specify the label for a labeled parameter.

In R, the tilde operator is used to separate the left- and right-hand sides in a model formula.

In Object REXX, the twiddle is used as a &quot;message send&quot; symbol. For example, codice_19 would cause the codice_20 method to act on the object codice_21&#x27;s codice_22 attribute, returning the result of the operation. codice_23 returns the object that received the method rather than the result produced. Thus, it can be used when the result need not be returned or when cascading methods are to be used. codice_24 would send multiple concurrent codice_25 messages, thus invoking the codice_25 method three consecutive times on the codice_27 object.

In Raku, a prefixing tilde converts a value to a string. An infix tilde concatenates strings, taking place of the dot operator in Perl, as the dot is used for member access instead of . is called &quot;the smartmatch operator&quot; and its semantics depend on the type of the right-side argument. Namely, it checks numeric and string equalities, performs regular expression match tests (as opposed to in Perl), and type checking.
my $concatResult = &quot;Hello &quot; ~ &quot;world!&quot;;
$concatResult ~~ /&lt;|w&gt;&lt;[A..Z]&gt;&lt;[a..z]&gt;*&lt;|w&gt;/;

say $/; # outputs &quot;Hello&quot;
# the $/ variable holds the last regex match result
In YAML, the &quot;Core schema,&quot; a set of aliases that processors are recommended to use, resolves a tilde as null.

====Keyboards====

The presence (or absence) of a tilde engraved on the keyboard depends on the territory where it was sold. In either case, computer&#x27;s system settings determine the keyboard mapping and the default setting will match the engravings on the keys. Even so, it certainly possible to configure a keyboard for a different locale than that supplied by the retailer. On American and British keyboards, the tilde is a standard keytop and pressing it produces a free-standing &quot;ASCII Tilde&quot;. To generate a letter with a tilde diacritic requires the US international or UK extended keyboard setting.
* With US-international, the key is a dead key: pressing that key and then a letter produces the tilde-accented form of that letter. (For example, produces .) With this setting active, an ASCII tilde can be inserted with the dead key followed by the space bar, or alternatively by striking the dead key twice in a row.
* With UK-extended, the key works normally but becomes a &#x27;dead key&#x27; when combined with AltGr. Thus followed by a letter produces the accented form of that letter.
* With a Mac either of the Alt/Option keys function similarly.
* With Linux, the compose key facility is used.
Instructions for other national languages and keyboards are beyond the scope of this article.

==== Backup filenames ====
The dominant Unix convention for naming backup copies of files is appending a tilde to the original file name. It originated with the Emacs text editor and was adopted by many other editors and some command-line tools.

Emacs also introduced an elaborate numbered backup scheme, with files named , and so on. It didn&#x27;t catch on, as the rise of version control software eliminates the need for this usage.

==== Microsoft filenames ====
The tilde was part of Microsoft&#x27;s filename mangling scheme when it extended the FAT file system standard to support long filenames for Microsoft Windows. Programs written prior to this development could only access filenames in the so-called 8.3 format—the filenames consisted of a maximum of eight characters from a restricted character set (e.g. no spaces), followed by a period, followed by three more characters. In order to permit these legacy programs to access files in the FAT file system, each file had to be given two names—one long, more descriptive one, and one that conformed to the 8.3 format. This was accomplished with a name-mangling scheme in which the first six characters of the filename are followed by a tilde and a digit. For example, &quot; might become &quot;.

The tilde symbol is also often used to prefix hidden temporary files that are created when a document is opened in Windows. For example, when a document &quot;Document1.doc&quot; is opened in Word, a file called &quot;~$cument1.doc&quot; is created in the same directory. This file contains information about which user has the file open, to prevent multiple users from attempting to change a document at the same time.
===Juggling notation===
In the juggling notation system Beatmap, tilde can be added to either &quot;hand&quot; in a pair of fields to say &quot;cross the arms with this hand on top&quot;. Mills&#x27; Mess is thus represented as (~2x,1)(1,2x)(2x,~1)*.

<text>Marie Roch Louis Reybaud (15 August 1799 – 26 or 28 October 1879) was a French writer, political economist and politician. He was born in Marseille.

== Biography ==
After travelling in the Levant and in India, he settled in Paris in 1829. Besides writing for the Radical press, he edited the &quot;Histoire scientifique et militaire de l&#x27;expédition française en Égypte&quot; in ten volumes (1830–36) and Dumont d&#x27;Urville&#x27;s &quot;Voyage au tour du monde&quot; (1833).

In 1840 he published &quot;Études sur les réformateurs ou socialistes modernes&quot; which gained him the Montyon prize (1841) and a place in the Académie des sciences morales et politiques (1850). In 1843 he published &quot;Jérôme Paturot à la recherche d&#x27;une position sociale&quot;, a clever social satire that had a prodigious success. In 1846 he abandoned his democratic views, and was elected liberal deputy for Marseille.

Reybaud was an early member of the Société d&#x27;économie politique organized in 1842 by Pellegrino Rossi.

His &quot;Jérôme Paturot a la recherche de 10 meilleure des republiques&quot; (1848) was a satire on the new republican ideas. Afterwards he published &quot;La Vie de l&#x27;emploi&quot; (1855), &quot;L&#x27;Industrie en Europe&quot; (1856), &quot;Études sur le régime de nos manufactures&quot; (1859), and &quot;Le coton: son régime, ses problèmes&quot; (1863).

Reybaud died in Paris.

<text>Ghee is a type of clarified butter, originating from India. It is commonly used for cooking, as a traditional medicine, and for Hindu religious rituals.

== Description ==
Ghee is typically prepared by simmering butter, which is obtained by churning cream, skimming any impurities from the surface, then pouring and retaining the clear liquid fat while discarding the solid residue that settles at the bottom. Spices can be added for flavor. The texture, color, and taste of ghee depend on the quality of the butter, the milk used in the process, and the duration of boiling.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;ghee&quot; comes from (&quot;&quot;, ) &#x27;clarified butter&#x27;, from , , &#x27;to sprinkle&#x27;; it is cognate with the Ancient Greek word (, &#x27;rubbed, anointed&#x27;), from which the English word &quot;Christ&quot; is derived.

== In Hinduism ==
Traditionally, ghee is made from bovine milk, either cow or water buffalo, and has been used in rituals since the Vedic period. It is a sacred requirement in Vedic &quot;yajña&quot; and &quot;homa&quot; (fire rituals), through the medium of Agni (fire) to offer oblations to various deities (See: Yajurveda).

Fire rituals are utilized for ceremonies such as marriage and funerals. Ghee is required in Vedic worship of &quot;mūrtis&quot; (divine deities), with &quot;aarti&quot; (offering of ghee lamp) called&quot; diyā&quot; or &quot;dīpa&quot; and for &quot;Pañcāmṛta&quot; (Panchamruta) where ghee along with mishri, honey, milk, and &quot;dahi&quot; (curd) is used for bathing the deities on the appearance day of Krishna on Janmashtami, &quot;Śiva&quot; (Shiva) on &quot;Mahā-śivarātrī&quot; (Maha Shivaratri). There is a hymn to ghee. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Kaurava&quot; were born from pots of ghee.

Ghee is also used in &quot;bhang&quot; in order to heat the cannabis to cause decarboxylation, making the drink psychoactive.

In Buddhist scripture, stages of dairy production are used as metaphors for stages of enlightenment. The highest-stage product, sarpir-maṇḍa, is theorised to be ghee or clarified butter.

== Culinary uses ==
Ghee is common in cuisines from the Indian subcontinent, including traditional rice preparations (such as &quot;biryani&quot;). In Maharashtra, polis or Indian flatbreads are accompanied with ghee. For example, &#x27;Puranpoli&#x27;, a typical Maharashtrian dish is eaten with much ghee. In Rajasthan, ghee often accompanies &quot;baati&quot;. All over North India, &quot;roti&quot; is served with ghee. In Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, ghee is provided alongside dosa, and kesari bhath. In Bengal (both West Bengal and Bangladesh) and Gujarat, &quot;khichdi&quot; is a traditional evening meal of rice with lentils, cooked in a curry made from dahi (curd), cumin seeds, curry leaves, cornflour, turmeric, garlic, salt and ghee. It is also an ingredient in &quot;kadhi&quot; and Indian sweets, such as &quot;Mysore pak,&quot; and varieties of &quot;halva&quot; and &quot;laddu&quot;. Indian restaurants typically incorporate large amounts of ghee, sometimes brushing &quot;naan&quot; and &quot;roti&quot; with it, either during preparation or just before serving. In the state of Odisha ghee is widely used in Odia dishes such as &quot;Khechedi&quot; and &quot;Dalma&quot;. Particularly the sattvic food prepared in most temples in Odisha has ghee as a major ingredient in its culinary tradition. Ghee is used in South Indian cuisine for tempering curries and in the preparation of rice dishes and sweets. North Indians also add ghee to rice before eating it with pickles, dal and curries. North Indians are among the biggest consumers of ghee. Vegetarian dishes of Andhra Pradesh especially use ghee for the preparation of savoury and sweet dishes alike. Ghee is important to traditional North Indian cuisine, with &quot;parathas, daals&quot; and curries often using ghee instead of oil for a richer taste. The type of ghee, in terms of animal source, tends to vary with the dish; for example, ghee prepared from cow&#x27;s milk () is traditional with rice or &quot;roti&quot; or as a finishing drizzle atop a curry or &quot;dal&quot; (lentils) whereas buffalo milk ghee is more typical for general cooking purposes.

Ghee is an ideal fat for deep frying because its smoke point (where its molecules begin to break down) is , which is well above typical cooking temperatures of around and above that of most vegetable oils.

== Flavour ==
The main flavour components of ghee are carbonyls, free fatty acids, lactones, and alcohols. Along with the flavour of milk fat, the ripening of the butter and the temperature at which it is clarified also affect the flavour. For example, ghee produced at or lower has a milder flavour, whereas results in a strong flavour.

== Differences from clarified butter==
The production of ghee differs slightly from that of clarified butter. The process of creating clarified butter is complete once the water is evaporated and the fat (clarified butter) is separated from the milk solids. However, the production of ghee includes simmering the butter, which makes it nutty-tasting and aromatic.

A traditional Ayurvedic recipe for ghee is to boil raw milk and let it cool to . After leaving it covered at room temperature for around 12 hours, add a bit of dahi (yogurt) to it and leave it overnight. This makes more yogurt. This is churned with water, to obtain cultured butter, which is used to simmer into ghee.

== Nutrition and health ==

Like any clarified butter, ghee is composed almost entirely of fat, 62% of which consists of saturated fats. Most commercial preparations in India were also found to contain significant amounts of trans fats. It has negligible amounts of lactose and casein and is, therefore, acceptable to most people who have a lactose intolerance or milk allergy.

Ghee consumption has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The British Dietetic Association, British Nutrition Foundation, National Health Service, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada and World Health Organization advise people to limit ghee consumption due to its high saturated fat content.

== Preparation methods ==

There are five common methods through which ghee is prepared. Industrial preparation on the other hand is done by using &quot;white butter&quot;, usually sourced from other dairies and contractors.

=== Milk butter ===
Sour raw milk is churned into butter. The butter is boiled in an open pan to allow the water to evaporate. The hot ghee is transferred and stored.

=== Direct cream ===
Fresh cream, cultured or washed cream is directly converted to ghee. This method requires a long heating time and produces a caramelized flavor.

=== Cream butter ===
Milk is separated into cream which is then churned into butter. The butter undergoes heat clarification to produce ghee.

=== Pre-stratification ===
This method is suitable for large quantities of butter. Butter is melted at for 30 minutes. Layers of protein particles, fat and buttermilk are induced. The buttermilk is drained out. The remaining layers of fat are heated to a temperature of to remove moisture and develop flavor.

== Packaging ==

Ghee is generally found to be packaged in airtight glass jars. They should be kept away from direct sunlight as sunlight can cause moisture to build inside the jar. Moisture can cause deterioration to the ghee&#x27;s quality as well as reduce its shelf life. To prevent the acceleration of the oxidation process, they should be protected from anything that causes it, such as UV rays from sunlight and fluorescent lights. If the jar is unopened, it does not need to be refrigerated as long as the previously mentioned conditions are met. Once opened, they can be stored in a kitchen cabinet for up to three months. Afterwards, it may be left in the refrigerator for up to a year. The refrigerator causes ghee to harden but if it is left at room temperature for a while, it will soften up again.

== Composition ==
Ghee may be made of milk from various domesticated ungulates, such as cows, buffaloes and sheep. The composition of ghee varies depending on the animal whose milk has been used. The vitamin A content ranged from 315 to 375 μg per 100 grams. Palmitic acid and oleic acid were two of the main fatty acids found in both cow and sheep ghee. The saturated fatty acid profile was 53.9 to 66.8%, the unsaturated fatty acid profile was 22.8 to 38.0% and the other fatty acids was 3.5 to 10.4%. Cholesterol amounts ranged from 252 to 284 mg/100 grams.

== Market ==
The market size of ghee in India is 10,000 crore rupees or US$1.5 billion as of 2016. India is the world&#x27;s largest producer of buffalo and cow milk and consequently also the largest producer and consumer of ghee.

<text>Valmiera () is the second largest city of the historical Vidzeme region, Latvia, with a total area of . As of 2002, Valmiera had a population of 27,323, and in 2020, it was at 24,879. It is a state city, and is the seat of the Valmiera Municipality. Valmiera is one of the oldest cities in Latvia; it was a member of the Hanseatic League. According to the ethnic composition, Valmiera has the largest proportion of ethnic Latvians among the state cities.

Valmiera lies at the crossroads of several important roads, to the north-east from Riga, the capital of Latvia, and south of the border with Estonia. Valmiera lies on both banks of the Gauja River.

==Names and etymology==
The name was derived from the Old German given name or the Slavic name . The town may have been named after the kniaz of the Principality of Pskov Vladimir Mstislavich, who became a vassal of Albert of Riga in 1212, and for a short time, it was a vogt of Tālava, Ydumea and Autīne. In another version, it may have been named after the King of Denmark Valdemar II, who allied with the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the Livonian Crusade. In the second half of 13th century, the Livonian Order built a castle which they called in German. During the Livonian War, the town was known in Russian as (), but during the period of the Russian Empire, it was known as (Wolmar).

==History==

Valmiera and its surroundings have been one of the longest-inhabited regions of Latvia. Archeological evidence indicates the site was inhabited 9,000 years ago.
In 1224 after partition of Tālava trade roads along the Gauja river became property of Livonian Brothers of the Sword who erected a castle which is today known as Valmiera Castle. After the Battle of Saule in 1236 Valmiera Castle and nearby lands became the property of the newly established Livonian Order.

Valmiera was first mentioned as a town in a chronicle dating back to 1323. The actual founding of the town probably occurred at least 40 years earlier when the master of the Livonian Order Wilken von Endorp constructed a castle (&quot;Wolmar&quot;) and Catholic church on the banks of the river Gauja. Valmiera was a member of the Hanseatic League from the 14th–16th centuries. Involvement in the Hansa brought significant trade and movement into the town&#x27;s life.
During the 14th–16th centuries several regional assemblies (landtags) were held in Valmiera. After the Livonian War in 1583 Valmiera was heavily devastated and was incorporated into the Duchy of Livonia as part of Wenden Voivodeship. After the Polish-Swedish war in 1622 Valmiera was managed by the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden Axel Oxenstierna.
During the Great Northern War Valmiera was again destroyed and burned down in 1702. It was further devastated by plague. During the first half of the 18th century Valmiera was on the decline.
In 1738 M.E. von Hallart opened the first seminary of the Moravian Church in Valmiera, a movement which played an important role in the history of Vidzeme.
In 1785 Valmiera became the centre of a district. The town saw rapid development in the 19th century. First it was stimulated by the building of the first bridge over the river Gauja in 1865. Later the building of the Riga-St.Petersburg railway line through the town in 1899 also played a major role. Many new factories were built in the town and new settlements were growing on both banks of the river Gauja. During 1911–12 a narrow gauge railway line Ainaži-Valmiera-Smiltene was built thus making Valmiera a major transport hub. In 1906 Municipal elections were held and Valmiera was one of the few towns in Latvia where Latvians won the majority of seats (18 of 24). As a result, local doctor Georgs Apinis was elected as mayor.
During the first quarter of the 20th century Valmiera also became a centre of culture and education as many schools were opened in the town. Among them were the Vidzeme teachers seminary, women gymnasium and merchant school.

During World War II, Valmiera was captured by troops of the German Army Group North on 4 July 1941 and placed under the administration of Reichskommissariat Ostland. In October 1941, 209 Jews from Valmiera and surrounding areas were murdered in local forests. The city was recaptured on 24 September 1944 by troops of the 3rd Baltic Front of the Red Army during the Riga Offensive. During the war almost all buildings at the center of Valmiera were destroyed.

The Cold War Liepas Air Base was located nearby.

Version 2.2 of the open source mapping application QGIS was named in honor of Valmiera.

<doc id="212396" wikidata="Q863266" url="?curid=212396" title="Tallow">
<text>Tallow is a rendered form of beef or mutton suet, primarily made up of triglycerides.

In industry, tallow is not strictly defined as beef or mutton suet. In this context, tallow is animal fat that conforms to certain technical criteria, including its melting point. Commercial tallow commonly contains fat derived from other animals, such as lard from pigs, or even from plant sources.
The solid material remaining after rendering is called cracklings, greaves, or graves. It has been used mostly for animal food, such as dog food.

In the soap industry and among soap-making hobbyists, the name tallowate is used informally to refer to soaps made from tallow. Sodium tallowate, for example, is obtained by reacting tallow with sodium hydroxide (lye, caustic soda) or sodium carbonate (washing soda). It consists chiefly of a variable mixture of sodium salts of fatty acids, such as oleic and palmitic.

==Composition==
Tallow is 100% fat, mainly of monounsaturated fats (52%) and saturated fats (42%), and contains no water, protein or carbohydrates (table). 

The fatty acid content of tallow is:
*Saturated fatty acids:
**Palmitic acid (C16:0): 26%
**Stearic acid (C18:0): 14%
**Myristic acid (C14:0): 3%
*Monounsaturated fatty acids:
**Oleic acid (C18-1, ω-9): 47%
**Palmitoleic acid (C16:1): 3%
*Polyunsaturated fatty acids:
**Linoleic acid: 3%
**Linolenic acid: 1%

==Uses==

Tallow is used mainly in producing soap and animal feed.

===Food===
A significant use of tallow is for the production of shortening. It is also one of the main ingredients of the Native American food pemmican. With a smoke point of , tallow is traditionally used in deep frying and was preferred for this use until the rise in popularity of plant oils for frying. Before switching to pure vegetable oil in 1990, McDonald&#x27;s cooked its French fries in a mixture of 93% beef tallow and 7% cottonseed oil. According to a 1985 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, tallow was also used for frying at Burger King, Wendy&#x27;s, Hardee&#x27;s, Arby&#x27;s, Dairy Queen, Popeyes, and Bob&#x27;s Big Boy. Tallow is, however, making a comeback in certain nutrition circles.

====Greaves====

Greaves (also &quot;graves&quot;) or cracklings is the fibrous matter remaining from rendering, typically pressed into cakes and used for animal feed, especially for dogs and hogs, or as fish bait. In the past, it has been both favoured and shunned in dog food.

===Fuel===
====Biodiesel====
Tallow can be used for the production of biodiesel in much the same way as oils from plants are currently used.

====Aviation fuel====
The United States Air Force has experimented successfully with the use of beef tallow in aviation biofuels. During five days of flight testing from August 23 to 27, 2010, at Edwards Air Force Base, California, a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III flew using JP-8 conventional jet fuel in three of its engines and a 50/50 blend of JP-8 and HRJ biofuel made from beef tallow in one engine on August 23, followed by a flight with the same 50/50 blend in all four engines on August 24. On August 27, it flew using a blend of 50% JP-8, 25% HRJ, and 25% coal-based fuel made through the Fischer–Tropsch process, becoming the first United States Department of Defense aircraft to fly on such a blend and the first aircraft to operate from Edwards using a fuel derived from beef tallow.

===Printing===
Tallow also has a use in printmaking, where it is combined with bitumen and applied to metal print plates to resist acid etching.

The use of trace amounts of tallow as an additive to the substrate used in polymer banknotes came to light in November 2016. Notes issued in 24 countries including Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom were found to be affected, leading to objections from vegans and members of some religious communities.

===Candles===

Tallow once was widely used to make molded candles before more convenient wax varieties became available and for some time after they continued to be a cheaper alternative. For those too poor even to avail themselves of homemade, molded tallow candles, the &quot;tallow dip&quot; a reed that had been dipped in melted tallow or sometimes a strip of burning cloth in a saucer/cresset of tallow grease was an accessible substitute. Such a candle was often simply called a &quot;dip&quot; or, because of its low cost, a &quot;farthing dip&quot; or &quot;penny dip&quot;.

===Lubrication===
Early in the development of steam-driven piston engines, the hot vapors and liquids washed away most lubricants very quickly. It was soon found that tallow was quite resistant to this washing. Tallow and compounds including tallow were widely used to lubricate locomotive and steamship engines at least until the 1950s. (During World War II, the vast fleets of steam-powered ships exhausted the supply, leading to the large-scale planting of rapeseed because rapeseed oil also resisted the washing effect.) Tallow is still used in the steel rolling industry to provide the required lubrication as the sheet steel is compressed through the steel rollers. There is a trend toward replacing tallow-based lubrication with synthetic oils in rolling applications for surface cleanliness reasons.

Another industrial use is as a lubricant for certain types of light engineering work, such as cutting threads on electrical conduit. Specialist cutting compounds are available, but tallow is a traditional lubricant that is easily available for cheap and infrequent use.

The use of tallow or lard to lubricate rifles was the spark that started the Indian Mutiny of 1857. To load the new Pattern 1853 Enfield Rifle, the sepoys had to bite the cartridge open. It was believed that the paper cartridges that were standard issue with the rifle were greased with lard (pork fat), which was regarded as unclean by Muslims, or tallow (cow fat), which is incompatible with Hindu dietary laws. Tallow, along with beeswax, was also used in the lubricant for American Civil War ammunition used in the Springfield rifled musket. A combination of mutton tallow, paraffin wax and beeswax is still used as a patch or projectile lubricant in present-day black powder arms.

Tallow is used to make a biodegradable motor oil.

Tallow is also used in traditional bell foundry, as a separation for the false bell when casting.

===Industrial===
Tallow can be used as flux for soldering.

===Textiles===
Mutton tallow is widely used as starch, lubricant and softener in textile manufacturing. Pretreatment processes in textiles include a process called sizing. In sizing, a chemical is necessary to provide required strength to yarns mounted on the loom. Mutton tallow provides required strength and lubrication to the yarns.

<doc id="212399" wikidata="Q700638" url="?curid=212399" title="Eugène Burnouf">
<text>Eugène Burnouf (; April 8, 1801May 28, 1852) was a French scholar, an Indologist and orientalist. His notable works include a study of Sanskrit literature, translation of the Hindu text &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and Buddhist text &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. He wrote a foundational text on Buddhism and also made significant contributions to the deciphering of Old Persian cuneiform.

==Life==
He was born in Paris. His father, Professor Jean-Louis Burnouf (1775–1844), was a classical scholar of high reputation, and the author, among other works, of an excellent translation of Tacitus (6 vols., 1827–1833). Eugène Burnouf published in 1826 an &quot;Essai sur le Pali ...&quot;, written in collaboration with Christian Lassen; and in the following year &quot;Observations grammaticales sur quelques passages de l&#x27;essai sur le Pali&quot;.

The next great work he undertook was the deciphering of the Avesta manuscripts brought to France by Anquetil-Duperron. By his research a knowledge of the Avestan language was first brought into the scientific world of Europe. He caused the &quot;Vendidad Sade&quot;, to be lithographed with the utmost care from the manuscript in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and published it in folio parts, 1829–1843.

From 1833 to 1835 he published his &quot;Commentaire sur le Yaçna, l&#x27;un des livres liturgiques des Parses&quot;.

At about the same time in his life, Eugène Burnouf made significant contributions to the deciphering of Old Persian cuneiform. Copies of cuneiform inscriptions from Persepolis had been published by Carsten Niebuhr many years earlier in 1778 and some preliminary inferences had already been made by other scholars such as Georg Friedrich Grotefend about these Persian inscriptions. In 1836, Eugène Burnouf discovered that the first of the inscriptions contained a list of the satrapies of Darius. With this clue in his hand, he was able to identify and publish an alphabet of thirty letters, most of which he had correctly deciphered.

A month earlier, Burnouf&#x27;s friend Professor Christian Lassen of Bonn, had also published a work on &quot;The Old Persian Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persepolis&quot;. He and Burnouf had been in frequent correspondence, and (Burnouf&#x27;s?) claim to have independently detected the names of the satrapies, and thereby to have fixed the values of the Persian characters, was in consequence fiercely attacked. However, whatever his obligations to Burnouf may have been, according to Sayce, Lassen&#x27;s &quot;contributions to the decipherment of the inscriptions were numerous and important.&quot;

A year later in 1837, Henry Rawlinson had made a copy of the much longer Behistun inscriptions in Persia. Carved in the reign of King Darius of Persia (522 BC–486 BC), the inscriptions consisted of identical texts in the three official languages of the empire: Old Persian, Babylonian, and Elamite. Rawlinson sent a translation of the opening paragraphs to the Royal Asiatic Society. Before this paper was published, however, the works of Lassen and Burnouf reached him, prompting a series of revisions and a delay in publication. In 1847 the first part of Rawlinson&#x27;s Memoir was published, followed by the second part in 1849. The task of deciphering the Persian cuneiform texts was virtually accomplished.

Eugène Burnouf received many Sanskrit texts from Indologist and anthropologist Brian Houghton Hodgson. He published the Sanskrit text and French translation of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana ou histoire poétique de Krichna&quot; in three folio volumes (1840–1847). His last works were &quot;Introduction à l&#x27;histoire du Bouddhisme indien&quot; (1844), and a translation of &quot;Le lotus de la bonne loi&quot; (&quot;The Lotus Sutra&quot;, 1852). According to Jonathan Silk, Burnouf can be regarded as &quot;the founding father of modern Buddhist scientific studies.&quot;

He had been for twenty years a member of the Academie des Inscriptions and professor of Sanskrit in the Collège de France. &quot;Introduction à l&#x27;Histoire du Bouddhisme Indien&quot; is recognized as an introduction to Buddhist metaphysics which influenced many French occultists in the nineteenth century for whom indianism and Sanskrit texts were a source of inspiration.

See a notice of Burnouf&#x27;s works by Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire, prefixed to the second edition (1876) of the &quot;Introduction à l&#x27;histoire du Bouddhisme indien&quot;; also Naudet, &quot;Notice historique sur MM. Burnouf, père et fils&quot;, in &quot;Mémoires de l&#x27;Académie des Inscriptions&quot;. A list of his valuable contributions to the &quot;Journal asiatique&quot; and of his manuscript writings, is given in the appendix to the &quot;Choix de lettres d&#x27;Eugène Burnouf&quot; (1891).

His cousin Emile-Louis Burnouf (1821–1907) continued his work on Sanskrit language.

<text>Christian Lassen (22 October 1800 – 8 May 1876) was a Norwegian-born, German orientalist and Indologist. He was a professor of Old Indian language and literature at the University of Bonn.

==Biography==
He was born at Bergen, Norway where he attended Bergen Cathedral School. Having received an education at the University of Oslo, he moved to Germany and continued his studies at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Bonn where Lassen acquired a sound knowledge of Sanskrit. He spent three years in Paris and London, engaged in copying and collating manuscripts, and collecting materials for future research, especially with reference to Hindu drama and philosophy. During this period he published, jointly with Eugène Burnouf, his first work, &quot;Essai sur le Pâli&quot; (Paris, 1826).

On his return to Bonn he studied Arabic, and took the degree of Ph.D., his dissertation discussing the Arabic notices of the geography of the Punjab (&quot;Commentario geographica historica de Pentapotamia Indica&quot;, Bonn, 1827). Soon after he was admitted &quot;Privatdozent&quot;, and in 1830 was appointed extraordinary and in 1840 ordinary professor of Old Indian language and literature. Lassen remained at the University of Bonn to the end of his life. Having been affected with almost total blindness for many years, by 1864 he was allowed to give up lecturing.
He died at Bonn and was buried at Alter Friedhof.
==Work==
In 1829–1831 he brought out, in conjunction with August Wilhelm von Schlegel, a critical annotated edition of the &quot;Hitopadeśa&quot;. The appearance of this edition marks the starting-point of the critical study of Sanskrit literature. Lassen assisted von Schlegel in editing and translating the first two cantos of the epic &quot;Rāmāyana&quot; (1829-1838). In 1832 he brought out the text of the first act of Bhavabhuti&#x27;s drama, &quot;Mālatīmādhava&quot;, and a complete edition, with a Latin translation, of the &quot;Sānkhya-kārikā&quot;. In 1837 followed his edition and translation of Jayadeva&#x27;s charming lyrical drama, &quot;Gītagovinda&quot; and his &quot;Institutiones linguae Pracriticae&quot;. His &quot;Anthologia Sanscritica&quot;, which came out the following year, contained several hitherto unpublished texts, and did much to stimulate the study of Sanskrit in German universities. In 1846 Lassen brought out an improved edition of Schlegel&#x27;s text and translation of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.
As well as the study of Indian languages, he was a scientific pioneer in other fields of philological inquiry. In his &quot;Beiträge zur Deutung der Eugubinischen Tafeln&quot; (1833) he prepared the way for the correct interpretation of the Umbrian inscriptions; and the &quot;Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes&quot; (7 vols., 1837–1850), started and largely conducted by him, contains, among other valuable papers from his pen, grammatical sketches of the Beluchi and Brahui languages, and an essay on the Lycian inscriptions.

===Old Persian cuneiform===

Soon after the appearance of Burnouf&#x27;s &quot;Commentaire sur le Yacna&quot; (1833), Lassen also directed his attention to the Zend language, and to Iranian studies generally; and in &quot;Die altpersischen Keilinschriften von Persepolis&quot; (1836) he greatly improved the knowledge of the Old Persian cuneiform inscriptions, following the early efforts of Grotefend (1802) and Saint-Martin (1823). thereby anticipating, by one month, Burnouf&#x27;s &quot;Mémoire&quot; on the same subject, while Sir Henry Rawlinson&#x27;s famous memoir on the Behistun Inscription, though drawn up in Persia, at about the same time, did not reach the Royal Asiatic Society until three years later, 1839.

Subsequently, Lassen published, in the sixth volume of his journal (1845), a collection of all the Old Persian cuneiform inscriptions known up to that date. According to Sayce: 

===Brahmi script===
The first successful attempts at deciphering the Brahmi script were made in 1836 by Christian Lassen, who used a bilingual Greek-Brahmi coin of Indo-Greek king Agathocles to correctly identify several Brahmi letters. The task was then completed by James Prinsep, who was able to identify the rest of the Brahmi characters, with the help of Major Cunningham.

===Kharoshthi===
He also was one of the first scholars in Europe who took up, with signal success, the decipherment of the newly discovered Bactrian, Indo-Greek and Indo-Scythian coins with Kharoshthi legends, which furnished him the materials for &quot;Zur Geschichte der griechischen und indoskythsschen Könige in Bakterien, Kabul, und Indien&quot; (1838). In this, he closely followed the pioneering work of James Prinsep (1835), and Carl Ludwig Grotefend (1836).

He contemplated bringing out a critical edition of the &quot;Vendidad&quot;; but, after publishing the first five fargards (1852), he felt that his whole energies were required for the successful accomplishment of the great undertaking of his life—his &quot;Indische Altertumskunde&quot;. In this work—completed in four volumes, published respectively in 1847 (2nd ed., 1867), 1849 (2nd ed., 1874), 1858 and 1861—which forms one of the greatest monuments of untiring industry and critical scholarship, everything that could be gathered from native and foreign sources, relative to the political, social and intellectual development of India. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1868.

<doc id="212403" wikidata="Q15903261" url="?curid=212403" title="Marshalls">
<text>Marshalls, Inc. is an American chain of off-price department stores owned by TJX Companies. Marshalls has over 1,000 American stores, including larger stores named Marshalls Mega Store (stores operating with HomeGoods combined), covering 49 states and Puerto Rico, and 61 stores in Canada. Marshalls first expanded into Canada in March 2011.

Marshalls is one of the largest U.S. off-price family apparel and home fashion retailers, along with its sister company, TJ Maxx. Its slogans are &quot;Your Surprise Is Waiting&quot; and &quot;Never Boring, Always Surprising&quot;.

==History==
===Independent company===
Marshalls traces its history to 1956, when Alfred Marshall gathered a group of entrepreneurs on the East Coast, including Bernard Goldston, Norman Barren, and Irving Blitt (Frank Estey and Bernard Ribas joined the entrepreneurs in 1960 by purchasing Bernard Goldston&#x27;s shares), to collectively start up the &quot;Brand Names For Less&quot; concept. Marshalls did not carry clothing until Irving Blitt (who later handled the sporting goods concession) called his friend Al Marshall letting him know he had the opportunity to purchase factory second Arrow shirts while on a trip to New York.

Contemplating the dual postwar phenomena of a boom in the economy and growth in the suburbs, Marshall and associates came upon a way to meet it profitably. Together, they opened a self-service department store in Beverly, Massachusetts, offering apparel and homewares at low prices. Additional floor space was &quot;sublet&quot; to offer customers shoes, hardware, and sporting goods from separate sellers, but the separate ownership of those departments was invisible to the shopper. The original store also had a soda fountain/grill, which was another sublet of floor space, the &quot;A &amp; M Luncheonette&quot; (for Alice &amp; Mickey Masters, the proprietors).

The concept proved extremely successful. Ten years later, Marshalls had become the leading off-price retail chain in the nation. Given the volatility of the American economy in the 1970s, with recession affecting the spending habits of most shoppers, the off-price industry gathered speed. By buying up manufacturers&#x27; post-season, overrun, and close-out stock, Marshalls was able to offer fashionable, high-quality &quot;designer&quot; items at prices 20 to 60 percent less than those of the department stores.

===Melville Corporation===
In 1976, Marshalls was acquired by Melville Corporation. There were 36 stores in New England and California at this time. Marshall also independently owned five stores in St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. Maarten in the Caribbean. The brand surpassed $1 billion in sales in 1982. 

By April 1987, there were 261 stores across the country. However, profits began to slip in the mid-1980s when the company shifted to lower-priced goods, competing with other discount stores rather than department stores. Since Marshalls made up 28% of Melville&#x27;s sales at this time, there was a lot of focus on turning the store around. Marshalls was outperformed by rival TJ Maxx in the early 1990s. 

By 1993, Marshalls had expanded throughout 42 states including Hawaii, and had opened several downtown locations. Its first location in Puerto Rico opened in 1994. The company&#x27;s pretax operating earnings fell by 20% between 1993 and 1994. 

===TJX===
In 1995, Marshalls was purchased by TJX, the parent company of its main rival, TJ Maxx, for $550 million. There were 496 stores at the time.

Marshalls and T.J. Maxx operate as sister stores, and share a similar footprint throughout the country. While the two offer near-identical prices and have similar store layouts, Marshalls differentiates itself by its emphasis on family footwear and larger men&#x27;s and juniors departments. 

Starting in 2005, Marshalls began introducing Shoe MegaShop departments in its stores. The company added MegaShops to 240 Marshalls stores in 2008, with another 200 planned for fiscal 2009. Marshalls soon expanded the concept into standalone stores.

In 2015, Marshalls opened its 1,000th store. In 2019, the company began operating a website for online shopping. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Marshalls shut down all stores and suspended its online operations, closing all distribution and fulfillment centers and offices in March 2020. TJX began reopening stores in May and completed the process by the end of June.

==Legal troubles==
TJX paid US$100 million settlement in California to settle an employee class-action suit in 2002, which alleged that Marshalls abused exempt/nonexempt classifications to avoid the payment of overtime or compensation time to employees in certain roles performing non-exempt job duties, as required by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

==Charity==
The enterprise has developed national and local partnerships with U.S. charitable organizations. All donations and fund-raising efforts from Marshalls are connected to helping children, families, and their communities with these programs:
*Domestic Violence Prevention
*Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation
*National Youth Anti-Drug Campaign
*St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital
*United Way

==Marshalls Canada==
Marshalls opened its first locations in Canada in March 2011. As of November 2016, Marshalls Canada had 50 stores with plans to operate approximately 100 stores across the country.

<text>The Gilbert Islands (; formerly Kingsmill or King&#x27;s-Mill Islands) are a chain of sixteen atolls and coral islands in the Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Papua New Guinea and Hawaii. They constitute the main part of the country of Kiribati (the name of which is a rendering of &quot;Gilberts&quot; in the phonology of the indigenous Gilbertese).

==Geography==
The atolls and islands of the Gilbert Islands lie in an approximate north-to-south line. The northernmost island in the group, Makin, it is approximately from southernmost, Arorae, as the crow flies. Geographically, the equator is the dividing line between the northern and southern Gilbert Islands. However, the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) considers the entire Gilbert islands group to be in the South Pacific Ocean.

Another way to group the Gilbert Islands is according to their former administrative districts, which were known as the Northern, Central, and Southern Gilberts. (Tarawa was once a separate district as well).

At one time, a subset of the northern Gilbert islands was known as Scarborough Islands and a subset of the southern Gilberts as the Kingsmill Group; in some 19th century texts, this last name of Kingsmills was applied to the entire Gilberts group.

Geologically, the Gilberts and the Ratak chain of the Marshall Islands to their north together form a continuous chain of seamounts.

===Islands of the Gilberts===
In official north–south order (grouped by former administrative district), the islands and atolls are:

=== Northern Gilberts ===
The Northern Gilberts (&quot;meang&quot; or &quot;mweang&quot;) geographically and traditionally encompass Butaritari, Makin, Marakei, Abaiang (literally &quot;northland&quot;) and Tarawa. They have unique tonal accents with differences particularly noted amongst Butaritari and Makin inhabitants. Traditionally, Butaritari and Makin were ruled by a chief who lived on Butaritari (called Makin or Great Makin). This chief had all the powers and authority to make and impose decisions on the Islanders, a system very different from the Southern Gilbert Islands where power was wielded collectively by the &quot;unimwane&quot; or old men of the island.

The northern Gilberts have a greater mean rainfall in comparison to the southern and central Gilberts allowing cultivation of a wider crop range. Butaritari and Makin supply most of the bananas sold in Kiribati. The cultivation of taro or &quot;babai&quot; (&quot;Cyrtosperma merkusii&quot;) has been historically easier in the northern Gilberts due to a higher water table and regular rainfall.

===Central Gilberts===
The Central Gilberts or &quot;nuka&quot; have traditionally included Maiana, Abemama, Kuria and Aranuka. However, the latter three are considered the main islands that have unique historical and cultural characteristics which distinguish the Central Gilberts from the north and south.

Tembinok&#x27;, the last king of Abemama, Kuria and Aranuka, died in the early part of the 20th century.

===Southern Gilberts===
The Southern Gilberts include the atolls of Nonouti, South and North Tabiteuea, Beru, Nikunau, Onotoa, Tamana and the most southerly island of Arorae.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The islands had been inhabited by Oceanians for several millennia (at least 2,000 years, probably 3,000).

===Contact with Europeans===

In 1606, Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queirós sighted Butaritari and Makin, which he named the Buen Viaje Islands.
The British explorer Vice-Admiral John Byron passed through the islands in 1765 during his circumnavigation of the globe as captain of .

In 1788 Captain Thomas Gilbert on and Captain John Marshall on crossed through Kuria, Aranuka, Tarawa, Abaiang, Butaritari, and Makin without attempting to land on the atolls.

In 1820, the islands were named the Gilbert Islands or &quot;îles Gilbert&quot; (in French) by Adam Johann von Krusenstern, a Baltic German Admiral of the Russian Czar after the British Captain Thomas Gilbert, who crossed the archipelago in 1788. French captain Louis Duperrey was the first to map the whole Gilbert Islands archipelago. He commanded &quot;La Coquille&quot; on its circumnavigation of the earth (1822–1825).

=== US exploration ===
Many whaling ships called at the islands in the 19th century. The first recorded visit was by the &quot;Ann and Hope&quot;, which called at Nikunau in December 1799.

Two ships of the United States Exploring Expedition (1838–1842), and , under the command of Captain William L. Hudson, visited many of the Gilbert Islands (then called the Kingsmill Islands or Kingsmill Group in English). While in the Gilberts, they devoted considerable time to mapping and charting reefs and anchorages.

===Colonial rule===

In 1886, an Anglo-German agreement partitioned the &quot;unclaimed&quot; central Pacific, leaving Nauru in the German sphere of influence, while Ocean Island and the future GEIC wound up in the British sphere of influence. A British protectorate was first proclaimed over the Gilberts by Captain Edward Davis of on 27 May 1892. British official Arthur Mahaffy visited the Islands in 1909. He noted that the &quot;villages are kept in admirable order and the roads are scrupulously clean.&quot; A hospital was on each island, as well. The conduct of William Telfer Campbell, the second resident commissioner of the Gilberts, was criticised as to his legislative, judicial and administrative management (including allegations of forced labour exacted from islanders) and became the subject of the 1909 report by Arthur Mahaffy. In 1913 an anonymous correspondent to &quot;The New Age&quot; journal described the mis-administration of Telfer Campbell and challenged the impartiality of Arthur Mahaffy as he was a former colonial official in the Gilberts.

In 1915, starting from 1916, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands were proclaimed a colony of the British Empire.

==== Population ====
The natives of the Gilbert Islands are Austronesian peoples, similar in many respects to the natives of the Marshalls or the Carolines.

In Mahaffy&#x27;s 1909 report to the British Government he described the missionaries or Protectorate staff then resident in the Gilbert Islands.

At the outbreak of World War II, about 78% of the native population were said to be Christians. This group was divided mainly into two denominations: Congregationalists (43%) and Roman Catholics (35%), Catholics becoming quickly the majority at the end of the Colony. The rest of the population were then largely semi-pagan agnostics; they did not adhere to the Christian faith, nor did they retain much of their beliefs in their own ancient gods.

Native diet during this time consisted mainly of fish, coconuts, pandanus fruit, &quot;babai&quot; (swamp taro), chicken, and some pork. Housing for Europeans employed in the island was simple: constructed of European and native materials and generally of the bungalow type. Mahaffy described the native clothing as being of &quot;shocking shape&quot; and &quot;atrocious color&quot;, and that the style was changing into &quot;kilt(s) of leaves or fine woven mats&quot;.

==== Economy ====
In the early to mid 20th century the principal source of income for Gilbert islanders was from working on the production of phosphate from the deposits on Banaba (Ocean Island), an island to the west of the Gilbert Islands. In addition, coconut palms were cultivated on some of the islands. All labor was supervised by the British and every effort was made to see that the wages and living conditions were fair and adequate. (Source?) Sanitary inspections by the British did much to improve the general living conditions on most of the islands.

Arthur Mahaffy noted in 1909 that &quot;extreme poverty is virtually unknown&quot;, and that most people on the island owned their own land. Residents paid taxes, with the majority of taxes going back into the community, and a small portion going to the Protectorate.

==== Administration ====
Judged to be about 84% literate, the Gilbertese responded readily to the colony&#x27;s educational efforts. All education in the islands came under the supervision of the Colonial Education Department whose aims were to educate native boys for employment in government and commercial work, and to standardize the level of education throughout the colony. The bulk of the education was provided by the missions, which maintained all the village schools and trained the native school teachers.

With the availability of European-style medical care life improved. The Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme sought to provide an outlet through the development of three uninhabited atolls in the Phoenix Islands and was the last attempt at human colonization within the British Empire.

=== Religion ===
Hiram Bingham II (1831–1908) was the first to translate the Bible into Gilbertese, and also wrote hymns for the Gilbertese language. Joanna Gordon-Clark writes of their religious belief:

The Gilbert (and Ellice) Islanders had a strong set of beliefs of their own, pre the Christian missionaries; they had a strong foundation myth, involving trees and the two genders. Their ancestors, they said, had been white skinned and red haired and came from elsewhere, perhaps the West (possibly coinciding with the outward spread of Homo sapiens from Africa and elsewhere). As might be expected, they gave power to the natural forces and gave them names and godly characteristics (sun, moon, &quot;etc&quot;.) but believed in one spirit god, a bit similar to the god of Genesis, in that he/she seemed to have power over dark and light and so on, and was pretty much invisible. They had a strong belief in behaving properly to their ancestors, and especially their parents, and had well-developed community rules for courtesy to others. Read &quot;A Pattern of Islands&quot;, by Arthur Grimble, who worked in these islands and on Banaba, for the Colonial Administration, from just before the First World War to the mid thirties, or thereabouts. It is a remarkable, informative, funny and warm-hearted account of these people and their religion. Other religions on the islands figure slightly, and there are remarkable stories of adventures, bravery, political machinations, &quot;etc&quot;. Probably out of print, but second hand copies are available I think, I have two, and the illustrations are delightful.

=== World War II ===
On the same day as the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese invaded the Gilbert Islands, occupying 3 of them by 9 December 1941.

On 17 August 1942, 221 U.S. Marines of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion raided Makin from two submarines. The raid was intended by the Americans to confuse the Japanese about US intentions in the Pacific, a feint to draw Japanese attention away from the planned invasion route through the Solomons. It is instead believed to have alerted the Japanese to the strategic importance of the Gilbert Islands and led to their reinforcement and fortification. Marines captured during this operation were subsequently summarily executed by the Japanese, in gross violation of the laws of war.
The 19 Marines who died were left behind for the villagers to bury. In 1999, a Marine Honor guard was sent to recover the bodies and found them after a villager showed them where to dig. All were exhumed and were taken to the United States.

Tarawa and Abemama were occupied in force by the Japanese in September 1942 and during the next year garrisons were built up on Betio (Tarawa Atoll), and Butaritari (Makin Atoll). Only nominal forces were placed on other islands in the Gilberts.

On 20 November 1943, the U.S. Army and U.S. 2nd Marine Division landed on Makin and Tarawa, initiating the battles of Makin and Tarawa, in which the Japanese were defeated. The Gilbert Islands were then used to support the invasion of the Marshall Islands in February 1944. The US built bases on Islands.

===Self-determination===
The Gilbert and Ellice Islands became autonomous in 1971. From 1975 to 1978, the Ellice Islands were separated, and the Gilberts became the Gilbert Islands colony, which issued stamps under that name. In 1979, the Gilberts opted for independence, becoming the independent state of Kiribati. The Ellice Islands became the independent state of Tuvalu in 1978.

<text>In computer science, transaction processing is information processing that is divided into individual, indivisible operations called &quot;transactions&quot;. Each transaction must succeed or fail as a complete unit; it can never be only partially complete.

For example, when you purchase a book from an online bookstore, you exchange money (in the form of credit) for a book. If your credit is good, a series of related operations ensures that you get the book and the bookstore gets your money. However, if a single operation in the series fails during the exchange, the entire exchange fails. You do not get the book and the bookstore does not get your money. The technology responsible for making the exchange balanced and predictable is called &quot;transaction processing&quot;. Transactions ensure that data-oriented resources are not permanently updated unless all operations within the transactional unit complete successfully. By combining a set of related operations into a unit that either completely succeeds or completely fails, one can simplify error recovery and make one&#x27;s application more reliable.

Transaction processing systems consist of computer hardware and software hosting a transaction-oriented application that performs the routine transactions necessary to conduct business. Examples include systems that manage sales order entry, airline reservations, payroll, employee records, manufacturing, and shipping.

Since most, though not necessarily all, transaction processing today is interactive, the term is often treated as synonymous with &quot;online transaction processing&quot;.

== Description ==
Transaction processing is designed to maintain a system&#x27;s Integrity (typically a database or some modern filesystems) in a known, consistent state, by ensuring that interdependent operations on the system are either all completed successfully or all canceled successfully.

For example, consider a typical banking transaction that involves moving $700 from a customer&#x27;s savings account to a customer&#x27;s checking account. This transaction involves at least two separate operations in computer terms: debiting the savings account by $700, and crediting the checking account by $700. If one operation succeeds but the other does not, the books of the bank will not balance at the end of the day. There must, therefore, be a way to ensure that either both operations succeed or both fail so that there is never any inconsistency in the bank&#x27;s database as a whole.

Transaction processing links multiple individual operations in a single, indivisible transaction, and ensures that either all operations in a transaction are completed without error, or none of them are. If some of the operations are completed but errors occur when the others are attempted, the transaction-processing system &quot;rolls back&quot; &quot;all&quot; of the operations of the transaction (including the successful ones), thereby erasing all traces of the transaction and restoring the system to the consistent, known state that it was in before processing of the transaction began. If all operations of a transaction are completed successfully, the transaction is committed by the system, and all changes to the database are made permanent; the transaction cannot be rolled back once this is done.

Transaction processing guards against hardware and software errors that might leave a transaction partially completed. If the computer system crashes in the middle of a transaction, the transaction processing system guarantees that all operations in any uncommitted transactions are cancelled.

Generally, transactions are issued concurrently. If they overlap (i.e. need to touch the same portion of the database), this can create conflicts. For example, if the customer mentioned in the example above has $150 in his savings account and attempts to transfer $100 to a different person while at the same time moving $100 to the checking account, only one of them can succeed. However, forcing transactions to be processed sequentially is inefficient. Therefore, concurrent implementations of transaction processing is programmed to guarantee that the end result reflects a conflict-free outcome, the same as could be reached if executing the transactions sequentially in any order (a property called serializability). In our example, this means that no matter which transaction was issued first, either the transfer to a different person or the move to the checking account succeeds, while the other one fails.

== Methodology ==
The basic principles of all transaction-processing systems are the same. However, the terminology may vary from one transaction-processing system to another, and the terms used below are not necessarily universal.

=== Rollback ===

Transaction-processing systems ensure database integrity by recording intermediate states of the database as it is modified, then using these records to restore the database to a known state if a transaction cannot be committed. For example, copies of information on the database &quot;prior&quot; to its modification by a transaction are set aside by the system before the transaction can make any modifications (this is sometimes called a &quot;before image&quot;). If any part of the transaction fails before it is committed, these copies are used to restore the database to the state it was in before the transaction began.

=== Rollforward ===
It is also possible to keep a separate journal of all modifications to a database management system. (sometimes called &quot;after images&quot;). This is not required for rollback of failed transactions but it is useful for updating the database management system in the event of a database failure, so some transaction-processing systems provide it. If the database management system fails entirely, it must be restored from the most recent back-up. The back-up will not reflect transactions committed since the back-up was made. However, once the database management system is restored, the journal of after images can be applied to the database (&quot;rollforward&quot;) to bring the database management system up to date. Any transactions in progress at the time of the failure can then be rolled back. The result is a database in a consistent, known state that includes the results of all transactions committed up to the moment of failure.

=== Deadlocks ===

In some cases, two transactions may, in the course of their processing, attempt to access the same portion of a database at the same time, in a way that prevents them from proceeding. For example, transaction A may access portion X of the database, and transaction B may access portion Y of the database. If at that point, transaction A then tries to access portion Y of the database while transaction B tries to access portion X, a &quot;deadlock&quot; occurs, and neither transaction can move forward. Transaction-processing systems are designed to detect these deadlocks when they occur. Typically both transactions will be cancelled and rolled back, and then they will be started again in a different order, automatically, so that the deadlock does not occur again. Or sometimes, just one of the deadlocked transactions will be cancelled, rolled back, and automatically restarted after a short delay.

Deadlocks can also occur among three or more transactions. The more transactions involved, the more difficult they are to detect, to the point that transaction processing systems find there is a practical limit to the deadlocks they can detect.

=== Compensating transaction ===
In systems where commit and rollback mechanisms are not available or undesirable, a compensating transaction is often used to undo failed transactions and restore the system to a previous state.

== ACID criteria ==

Jim Gray defined properties of a reliable transaction system in the late 1970s under the acronym &quot;ACID&quot;—atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

=== Atomicity ===

A transaction&#x27;s changes to the state are atomic: either all happen or none happen. These changes include database changes, messages, and actions on transducers.

=== Consistency ===
Consistency: A transaction is a correct transformation of the state. The actions taken as a group do not violate any of the integrity constraints associated with the state.

=== Isolation ===
Even though transactions execute concurrently, it appears to each transaction T, that others executed either before T or after T, but not both.

=== Durability ===
Once a transaction completes successfully (commits), its changes to the database survive failures and retain its changes.

== Implementations ==

Standard transaction-processing software, such as IBM&#x27;s Information Management System, was first developed in the 1960s, and was often closely coupled to particular database management systems. Client–server computing implemented similar principles in the 1980s with mixed success. However, in more recent years, the distributed client–server model has become considerably more difficult to maintain. As the number of transactions grew in response to various online services (especially the Web), a single distributed database was not a practical solution. In addition, most online systems consist of a whole suite of programs operating together, as opposed to a strict client–server model where the single server could handle the transaction processing. Today a number of transaction processing systems are available that work at the inter-program level and which scale to large systems, including mainframes.

One effort is the X/Open Distributed Transaction Processing (DTP) (see also Java Transaction API (JTA). However, proprietary transaction-processing environments such as IBM&#x27;s CICS are still very popular, although CICS has evolved to include open industry standards as well.

The term extreme transaction processing (XTP) was used to describe transaction processing systems with uncommonly challenging requirements, particularly throughput requirements (transactions per second). Such systems may be implemented via distributed or cluster style architectures. It was used at least by 2011.

<doc id="212410" wikidata="Q224872" url="?curid=212410" title="Lake Winnipesaukee">
<text>Lake Winnipesaukee () is the largest lake in the U.S. state of New Hampshire, located in the Lakes Region at the foothills of the White Mountains. It is approximately long (northwest-southeast) and from wide (northeast-southwest), covering — when Paugus Bay is included—with a maximum depth of . The center area of the lake is called The Broads.

The lake contains at least 264 islands, half of which are less than in size, and is indented by several peninsulas, yielding a total shoreline of approximately . The driving distance around the lake is . It is above sea level. Winnipesaukee is the third-largest lake in New England after Lake Champlain and Moosehead Lake.

Outflow is regulated by the Lakeport Dam in Lakeport, New Hampshire, on the Winnipesaukee River.

== History ==


The Abenaki name &quot;Winnipesaukee&quot; (often spelled Winnipiseogee in earlier centuries) means either &quot;smile of the Great Spirit&quot; or &quot;beautiful water in a high place&quot;. At the outlet of the lake, the Winnipesaukee people, a subtribe of the Pennacook, lived and fished at a village called Acquadocton. Today, the site is called The Weirs, named for the weirs that were noted by the colonists when first exploring the region.

Lake Winnipesaukee has been a popular tourist destination for more than a century, particularly among residents of Boston and New York City. 

Winnipesaukee is a glacial lake but an unusual one, since the last glaciation actually reversed the flow of its waters. Draining the central portion of New Hampshire, it once flowed southeast, leaving via what is now Alton Bay toward the Atlantic Ocean. When glacial debris blocked this path, flow was redirected westward through Paugus Bay into the Winnipesaukee River. The latter flows west from the lake and joins the Pemigewasset River in Franklin to form the Merrimack River, which flows south to Massachusetts and into the Atlantic.

Center Harbor witnessed the first intercollegiate sporting event in the United States, as Harvard defeated Yale by two lengths in the first Harvard–Yale Regatta on August 3, 1852. The outcome was repeated 100 years later when the schools celebrated the centennial of the race by again competing on Lake Winnipesaukee (Harvard winning by 2.7 seconds).

== Cities and towns ==
The communities that surround the lake, clockwise from the southernmost town, are:
*Alton, the largest town by area in the Lakes Region.
*Gilford, home to Gunstock Mountain Resort and Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion at Meadowbrook, a popular New Hampshire concert venue.
*Laconia, the main commercial city on the lake. Included in Laconia is Weirs Beach, the largest public beach on Winnipesaukee. Every year Laconia is home to Bike Week, attracting tens of thousands of motorcyclists to the area.
*Meredith, a tourist haven on the northwestern reach of the lake.
*Center Harbor, a small town in Belknap County which serves as the winter home for the MS &quot;Mount Washington&quot;.
*Moultonborough, with its Castle in the Clouds, an estate atop a small mountain.
*Tuftonboro, which contains the communities of Melvin Village and Mirror Lake.
*Wolfeboro, which bills itself as the &quot;Oldest Summer Resort in America&quot;.

== Divisions ==
The lake consists of a wide, relatively open central region known as the Broads, surrounded by several large bays, as well as many smaller inlets.

The daytime speed limit for boats on the entire lake is .

The main sections of the lake are:

=== The Broads ===
The Broads are a wide portion of Lake Winnipesaukee largely in Belknap County and extending slightly into Carroll County. It is a large island-free zone occupying the center of the lake.

Running along the main axis of the lake, the northwestern tip of the Broads is at the town of Center Harbor, while the southeastern end lies between the towns of Alton and Wolfeboro.

=== Meredith Bay ===
Meredith Bay lies at the western edge of Winnipesaukee. At the northern tip of Meredith Bay is the main village of the town of Meredith. Paugus Bay branches off to the south of Meredith Bay at Weirs Beach, near to where Meredith Bay joins the main body of the lake. Meredith Bay is separated from the Broads by a relatively narrow strait bordered by Governors Island to the south and Stonedam Island to the north. The northeastern shore of Meredith Bay is a long peninsula known as Meredith Neck.

=== Paugus Bay ===

Formerly a hydrologically distinct lake, Paugus Bay became joined to Winnipesaukee when the dam at Lakeport was constructed, raising the surface of Paugus Bay to be contiguous with Winnipesaukee. Paugus Bay joins the main lake in Meredith Bay, running south from a narrow channel connecting it to Meredith Bay. At the northern end of Paugus Bay, where it joins the main lake, is Weirs Beach, the largest and most visited public beach on the lake. At the other end is the village of Lakeport. Both Weirs Beach and Lakeport are villages within the city of Laconia. The eastern shore of the bay is closely followed by U.S. Route 3, and has numerous motels, hotels, inns, and bungalow complexes. The western shore is much less developed.

=== Alton Bay ===
Alton Bay is a narrow bay which runs due south from the southern corner of the main lake. It lies entirely within the town of Alton. The village of Alton Bay lies at the extreme southern tip.

=== Wolfeboro Bay ===
Wolfeboro Bay is a relatively small wide bay lying in the town of Wolfeboro, creating a small northerly bulge in the shoreline to the eastern edge of Winnipesaukee. A series of smaller lakes and streams connects Wolfeboro Bay to Lake Wentworth.

=== Winter Harbor ===
Winter Harbor is a Y-shaped bay with two branches, separated from the Broads by Wolfeboro Neck and Tuftonboro Neck. Winter Harbor is surrounded by many quiet resort communities in the towns of Wolfeboro and Tuftonboro. It also has panoramic views of the Belknap Mountains and looks out toward Rattlesnake Island.

=== Moultonborough Bay ===
The longest bay on Winnipesaukee is Moultonborough Bay. It is connected to the Broads by some narrow straits running between a cluster of islands including Long Island (the largest island in the lake), Cow Island, Little Bear Island, Sandy Island, and dozens of smaller islands and islets. The Moultonborough Neck separates the length of the bay from the main axis of the lake, and the Suissevale development in the town of Moultonborough is at the northern tip of the bay. Melvin Village, the main lakeside village of the town of Tuftonboro lies along the northeastern shore of the bay, closer to where it joins the Broads.

== Islands ==

There are at least 258 natural islands on Lake Winnipesaukee that are at least above lake level and contain vegetation, about 130 of which are over in size. 26 of these are or larger:

*Long Island—
*Bear Island—
*Cow Island—
*Governors Island—
*Rattlesnake Island—
*Welch Island—
*Little Bear Island—
*Stonedam Island—
*Timber Island—
*Sleepers Island—
*Mark Island—
*Black Island—
*Barndoor Island—
*Black Cat Island—
*Pine Island—
*Whortleberry Island—
*Sandy Island—
*Jolly Island—
*Three Mile Island—
*Round Island—
*Lockes Island—
*Diamond Island—
*Dow Island—
*Big Beaver Island—
*Camp Island—
*Mink Island—
*Birch Island—
Six islands are connected to the mainland by bridges (Black Cat, Governors, Long, Oak, Christmas (or Plummers) in Paugus Bay, and Worcester), and another eight (Bear, Birch, Cow, East Bear, Jolly, Loon, Three Mile, and Sandy) are served by the U.S. mail boat M/V &quot;Sophie C&quot;.

== Lakes Region ==
Along with the rest of New Hampshire&#x27;s Lakes Region, which also encompasses Lake Winnisquam, Lake Wentworth, Squam Lake, Newfound Lake, and numerous other smaller lakes and ponds, Winnipesaukee has been a vacation community for at least a century, particularly drawing people from the Boston region. The area is home to numerous summer theater troupes and offers a variety of land and water recreational activities. There are numerous hiking trails in and around the surrounding mountains, which include the Ossipee Mountains to the east, the Belknap Range to the west, and Red Hill to the north.

==Ships==
===Steamship &quot;Mount Washington&quot; and her successor===

The paddlesteamer , named after the highest of New Hampshire&#x27;s White Mountains, was launched in spring 1872 to carry mail, goods, and passengers on Lake Winnipesaukee, under the flag of the Boston and Maine Railroad. With a hull length of and a beam of she appeared as a typical representative of the North American sidewheelers around the second half of the century and was the largest steamer on the lake at that time. The huge paddle wheels were driven by a single-cylinder steam engine of at approximately 26 rpm. The power was transferred from the vertical single cylinder to the wheel shaft by the walking beam, high above the upper deck, oscillating in the frequency of the paddle wheels. Known as &quot;The Mount&quot;, her kitchen and restaurant service became famous.

On December 23, 1939, a nearby railroad station caught fire from an overheated stove. The fire soon spread to the ship, tied at the dock, and destroyed it. Efforts to cut &quot;Mount Washington&quot; loose were to no avail as it was a time of extremely low water and the hull was stuck fast in the mud of the lake bottom. Soon after, a local company was formed to build a new ship. Since Europe was already at war, and the US was stocking steel in a pre-war munitions build-up obtaining steel was impossible. Instead, they purchased an old sidewheel vessel on Lake Champlain: the &quot;Chateaugay&quot;, a , iron-hulled sidewheeler that was being used as a club house for the Burlington yacht club. It was cut into sections by Boston General Ship &amp; Engine Works and transported to Lake Winnipesaukee on rail cars. A new twin-screw vessel was designed for the hull being welded back together at Lakeport. Powered by two steam engines taken from another ocean-going yacht, the new MS &quot;Mount Washington&quot; made her maiden voyage on August 15, 1940.

Two years after her launch, the new &quot;Mount Washington&quot;″s engines and boilers were removed for use in a navy vessel during World War II. After the war, &quot;Mount Washington&quot; returned to the water. The ship was a success in the post-war tourist boom.

In 1982, &quot;Mount Washington&quot; was cut open and extended with an additional hull section to add larger lounge and food service facilities. Still popular, she makes one or two round trips on the lake per day during the summer season, as well as numerous dinner dance cruises in the evenings.

===Mailboat M/V &quot;Sophie C.&quot;===

The M/V &quot;Sophie C.&quot; is the oldest, and one of only two currently operating, floating United States Postal Service post offices. Floating post office service was started on Lake Winnipesaukee in 1892, and currently delivers mail daily to eight of the lake&#x27;s islands between June and September. The &quot;Sophie C.&quot; was built by Boston General Ship &amp; Engine Works in 1945 to temporarily replace the &quot;Mount Washington&quot;, whose engines and boilers had been commandeered by the Navy during World War II, and she took over the mail route from the &quot;Uncle Sam II&quot; in 1969.

As a floating post office, &quot;Sophie C.&quot; delivers mail Monday-Saturday, sells postage, and collects and postmarks outgoing mail. &quot;Sophie C.&quot; also operates as a sightseeing boat, carrying up to 125 people on her two cruises a day as she delivers mail, and sells ice cream and snacks to residents of the islands she serves. In 2018 and 2019, the M/V &quot;Doris E.&quot; replaced the &quot;Sophie C.&quot; as mail boat while the latter was undergoing repairs.

===Others===
The steamship &quot;Dover&quot;, in length, captained by Winborn Sanborn, operated by the Cocheco Railroad, traveled the lake in the 1850s. The &quot;Dover&quot; was lengthened to and renamed the &quot;Chocorua&quot; and sank in the late 1860s. It was refloated, but by the 1870s the new &quot;Mount Washington&quot; had replaced it.

== Seaplane base ==
The Alton Bay Seaplane Base is a state-owned, public-use seaplane base in Alton Bay, the southeast arm of the lake. In the winter it is the only FAA-approved ice runway in the contiguous United States, conditions permitting.

== Weather and climate ==
Average summertime on or next to the water brings days around 80 °F (26 °C), with overnight lows around 65 °F (18 °C). Less than one-half mile (800 m) away from the water, days can be warmer and nights cooler by several degrees. Summer&#x27;s most extreme temperatures away from the water may be as high as 100 °F (38 °C) and as low as 50 °F (10 °C). A typical winter day brings a maximum of 28 °F (−2 °C) with overnight minimum around 15 °F (−9 °C). Typical wintertime extremes are 50 °F (10 °C) and −20 °F (−30 °C) but even greater extremes have been recorded nearby.

The water temperature typically reaches the upper 70s F (around 25 °C) in late July and cools into the 60s (around 18 °C) in September. Several days of hot, humid weather at the height of summer can bring the water temperature well above 80 °F (26 °C). It normally freezes during the last week of December. Ice thickness during a typical winter can be in excess of in many parts of the lake.

== Ice-In and Ice-Out ==
Lake Winnipesaukee is known for its annual Ice-Out Contest, in which people try to guess the earliest date that the &quot;Mount Washington&quot; can safely leave her port in Center Harbor and motor to four other ports (Weirs Beach, Alton Bay, Wolfeboro, and Meredith). Since records began in 1851, ice-out has happened as early as March 17, in 2024 and as late as May 12, although 90 percent of the time it is declared during April. This official ruling is made by David Emerson of Emerson Aviation.

The earliest historical records relating to the area indicate that at a time prior to or during the 11th century, the present-day city of Phitsanulok was a small strategic known as &quot;Song Khwae&quot; (Thai: สองแคว). During the next century, in 1188, Nakhon Thai, near the center of the present Phitsanulok province, was established as the capital city of the Singhanavati Kingdom, an early city-state of Thailand.

Later, during Thailand&#x27;s Sukhothai Period, the city of Phitsanulok emerged as a major city in the east of the Sukhothai Kingdom, and the great temples of Wat Chula Manee, Wat Aranyik and Wat Chedi Yod Thong were constructed. In 1357, the renowned Wat Phra Sri Rattana Mahathat was erected, and the Ayutthaya Period witnessed the construction of several of the province&#x27;s other chief temples. Phitsanulok served for 25 years as the capital city of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. In 1555, King Naresuan the Great was born in Phitsanulok. Naresuan played a significant role in the history of Thailand, as he expanded the kingdom (then called &quot;Siam&quot;) to its greatest territorial extent by conquering sizable portions of modern-day Burma and Cambodia.

In recent times, Phitsanulok province has become an important agricultural center, part of the &quot;bread basket of Thailand&quot;, providing rice and other crops to consumers in Thailand and throughout the world. Extensive agricultural development over the last hundred years or so has spawned a modern infrastructure in the urban areas of the province, bringing with it an array of modern roads, universities, hospitals and other conveniences. Over the years, the Nan River and its tributaries have played a substantial role in the history and development of the region by providing a route for transportation, fertile soil for agriculture, and water for irrigation. The river waters have also served as a route for enemy invaders, and have been the source of periodic widespread flooding throughout the province.

<text>Parectypodus (meaning &quot;besides &quot;Ectypodus&quot;&quot;) is an extinct genus of mammals that lived from Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) to Eocene time in North America. It is a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata, suborder Cimolodonta, family Neoplagiaulacidae. It was named by G.L. Jepsen in 1930.

==Species==
*&quot;Parectypodus armstrongi&quot; (Johnston, P.A. &amp; Fox, R.C., 1984). From the Puercan (Paleocene) Ravenscrag Formation, site Rav W-1, Saskatchewan, Canada. This specimen resides in the collection of the University of Alberta.
*&quot;Parectypodus foxi&quot; (Storer, J.E., 1991). This Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous)-age species from the Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan is estimated to have weighed about 80 g.
*&quot;Parectypodus laytoni&quot; (Jepsen, G.L., 1940; Sloan, R.E., 1966), also known as &quot;Ectypodus laytoni&quot; (Jepsen 1940). Remains are known from the Lower Tiffanian (Middle-Late Paleocene) Princeton Quarry, Wyoming (United States). This species has been cited as a descendant of &quot;P. sinclairi&quot;. It is a small species, having a weight of perhaps 10 g.
*&quot;Parectypodus lunatus&quot; (Krause, D.W., 1982), also known as &quot;P. childei&quot; (Kühn, 1969). From the Wasatchian (Lower Eocene) Pocket Quarry of Colorado and Wyoming. This is a late species, having a weight of about 35 g.
*&quot;Parectypodus simpsoni&quot; (Jepsen, G.L., 1930). Eocene.
*&quot;Parectypodus sinclairi&quot; (Lamb, 1902; Clemens, 1964a). Known from the Puercan-Torrejonian (Paleocene) of Gidley Quarry, Montana, Wyoming, and Alberta, Canada. This species has been cited as having been derived from &quot;Mesodma formosa&quot;. It is a smaller species of about 15 g.
*&quot;Parectypodus sloani&quot; (Schiebout, J.A., 1974). Fossils of this species have been found in the Torrejonian (Paleocene)-age beds of Big Bend, Texas.
*&quot;Parectypodus sylviae&quot; (Rigby, J.K., 1980; Sloan, J.E., 1987) (=&quot;Ectypodus aphronorus&quot; (Sloan 1987), &quot;P. pattersoni&quot; (Sloan 1987)). Remains are known from the Torrejonian (Paleocene)-age Swain Quarry of Montana and Wyoming. The body weight of this species has been estimated as 15 g.
*&quot;Parectypodus trovessartianus&quot; (Cope, E.D., 1882; Van Valen &amp; Sloan, 1966). From the Puercan-Torrejonian (Paleocene) of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. The body mass of this species has been estimated to have been around 90 g.
*&quot;Parectypodus vanvaleni&quot; (Sloan, J.E. 1981). From the Puercan (Paleocene) of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico.

<text>Mineral oil is any of various colorless, odorless, light mixtures of higher alkanes from a mineral source, particularly a distillate of petroleum, as distinct from usually edible vegetable oils.

The name &#x27;mineral oil&#x27; by itself is imprecise, having been used for many specific oils over the past few centuries. Other names, similarly imprecise, include &#x27;white oil&#x27;, &#x27;paraffin oil&#x27;, &#x27;liquid paraffin&#x27; (a highly refined medical grade), (Latin), and &#x27;liquid petroleum&#x27;.

Most often, mineral oil is a liquid obtained from refining crude oil to make gasoline and other petroleum products. Mineral oils used for lubrication are known specifically as base oils. More generally, mineral oil is a transparent, colorless oil, composed mainly of alkanes and cycloalkanes, related to petroleum jelly. It has a density of around .

==Nomenclature==
Some of the imprecision in the definition of the names used for mineral oil (such as &#x27;white oil&#x27;) reflects usage by consumers and merchants who did not know, and usually had no need of knowing, the oil&#x27;s precise chemical makeup. Merriam-Webster states the first use of the term &quot;mineral oil&quot; as being 1771. Prior to the late 19th century, the chemical science to determine the makeup of an oil was unavailable in any case. A similar lexical situation occurred with the term &quot;white metal&quot;.

&quot;Mineral oil&quot;, sold widely and cheaply in the United States, is not sold as such in the United Kingdom. Instead, British pharmacologists use the terms &quot;paraffinum perliquidum&quot; for light mineral oil and &quot;paraffinum liquidum&quot; or &quot;paraffinum subliquidum&quot; for somewhat more viscous varieties. The term &quot;paraffinum liquidum&quot; is often seen on the ingredient lists of baby oil and cosmetics. British aromatherapists commonly use the term &quot;white mineral oil&quot;. In lubrication, mineral oils make up Group I, II, and III base oils that are refined from petroleum.

==Toxicology==
The World Health Organization classifies minimally treated mineral oils as carcinogens group 1 known to be carcinogenic to humans; Highly refined oils are classified group 3 as not suspected to be carcinogenic, from known available information sufficient to classify them as harmless.

The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) carried out a risk assessment on the migration of components from printing inks used on carton-board packaging—including mineral oils—into food in 2011, based on the findings of a survey conducted in the same year. The FSA did not identify any specific food safety concerns due to inks.

People can be exposed to mineral oil mist in the workplace through inhalation, skin contact, or eye contact. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the legal limit for mineral oil mist exposure in the workplace as over an 8-hour workday, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit of over an 8-hour workday, with a previous limit of for short-term exposure rescinded according to the 2019 Guide to Occupational Exposure Values compiled by the ACGIH. Levels of and higher are indicated as immediately dangerous to life and health. However, current toxicological data does not contain any evidence of irreversible health effects due to short-term exposure at any level; the current value of is indicated as being arbitrary.

==Applications==
===Biomedicine===
====Laxative====

Mineral oil is used as a laxative to alleviate constipation by retaining water in stool and the intestines. Although generally considered safe, as noted above, there is a concern of mist inhalation leading to serious health conditions such as pneumonia.

Mineral oil can be administered either orally or rectally. It is sometimes used as a lubricant in enema preparations as most of the ingested material is excreted in the stool rather than being absorbed by the body.

====Personal lubricant====
It is recommended by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine for use as a fertility-preserving vaginal lubrication. However, it is known that oils degrade latex condoms.

====Cell culture====
Mineral oil of special purity is often used as an overlay covering micro drops of culture medium in petri dishes, during the culture of oocytes and embryos in IVF and related procedures. The use of oil presents several advantages over the open culture system: it allows for several oocytes and embryos to be cultured simultaneously, but observed separately, in the same dish; it minimizes concentration and pH changes by preventing evaporation of the medium; it allows for a significant reduction of the medium volume used (as few as per oocyte instead of several milliliters for the batch culture); and it serves as a temperature buffer minimizing thermal shock to the cells while the dish is taken out of the incubator for observation.

====Veterinary====

Over-the-counter veterinarian-use mineral oil is intended as a mild laxative for pets and livestock. Certain mineral oils are used in livestock vaccines, as an adjuvant to stimulate a cell-mediated immune response to the vaccinating agent. In the poultry industry, plain mineral oil can also be swabbed onto the feet of chickens infected with scaly mites on the shank, toes, and webs. Mineral oil suffocates these tiny parasites. In beekeeping, food grade mineral oil-saturated paper napkins placed in hives are used as a treatment for tracheal and other mites. It is also used along with a cotton swab to remove un-shed skin (ashes) on reptiles such as lizards and snakes.

===Cosmetics===
Mineral oil is a common ingredient in baby lotions, cold creams, ointments, and cosmetics. It is a lightweight inexpensive oil that is odorless and tasteless. It can be used on eyelashes to prevent brittleness and breaking and, in cold cream, is also used to remove creme make-up and temporary tattoos. One of the common concerns regarding the use of mineral oil is its presence on several lists of comedogenic substances. These lists of comedogenic substances were developed many years ago and are frequently quoted in the dermatological literature.

The type of highly refined and purified mineral oil found in cosmetic and skincare products is noncomedogenic (does not clog pores).

===Mechanical, electrical, and industrial===

Mineral oil is used in a variety of industrial/mechanical capacities as a non-conductive coolant or thermal fluid in electric components, as it does not conduct electricity and functions to displace air and water. Some examples are in transformers, where it is known as transformer oil, and in high-voltage switchgear, where mineral oil is used as an insulator and coolant to disperse switching arcs. Because it is noncompressible, mineral oil is used as a hydraulic fluid in hydraulic machinery and vehicles.

The dielectric constant of mineral oil ranges from 2.3 at to 2.1 at .
Electric space heaters sometimes use mineral oil as a heat transfer oil. Lubricants used for older refrigerator and air conditioning compressors are based on mineral oil, especially those using R-22 refrigerant.

Mineral oil is used as a lubricant, a cutting fluid, and as a conditioning oil for jute fibres selected for textile production, a process known as &#x27;jute batching&#x27;. Spindle oils are light mineral oils used as lubricants in textile industries.

An often-cited limitation of mineral oil is that it is poorly biodegradable; in some applications, vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil or rapeseed oil may be used instead.

===Food preparation===
Because of its properties that prevent water absorption, combined with its lack of flavor and odor, food grade mineral oil is a popular preservative for wooden cutting boards, countertops, salad bowls, and utensils. Periodically rubbing a small amount of mineral oil into a wooden kitchen item impedes absorption of food liquids, and thereby food odors, easing the process of hygienically cleaning wooden utensils and equipment. The use of mineral oil to impede water absorption can also prevent cracks and splits from forming in wooden utensils due to wetting and drying cycles. However, some of the mineral oil used on these items, if in contact with food, will be picked up by it and therefore ingested.

Mineral oil is occasionally used in the food industry, particularly for confectionery. In this application, it is typically used for the glossy effect it produces, and to prevent the candy pieces from adhering to each other, such as in Swedish Fish. The use of food grade mineral oil is self-limiting because of its laxative effect, and is not considered a risk in food for any age class. The maximum daily intake is calculated to be about , of which some are contributed from its use on machines in the baking industry.

===Insecticide===

Mineral oil, under various names, is one of the most widely used insecticides. See Horticultural oil.

===Other uses===
Mineral oil&#x27;s ubiquity has led to its use in some niche applications as well:

* It is commonly used to create a wear effect on new clay poker chips, which can otherwise be accomplished only through prolonged use. Either the chips are placed in mineral oil for a short time, or the oil is applied to each chip then wiped off. This removes any chalky residue left-over from manufacture, and also improves the look and feel of the chips.

* Mineral oil is used as the principal fuel in some types of gel-type scented candles.

* It is used for cooling, such as in the liquid submersion cooling of components in some custom-built computers.

* Amateur radio operators frequently use veterinary-grade mineral oil as an inexpensive coolant for RF dummy loads, and as an electrical insulator and / or coolant for extra-high voltage circuitry, such as antenna-simulating “can-tennas”. Amateur use of mineral oil follows industrial use, since it typically is the insulating and cooling fluid in large electrical transformers and similar equipment, such as small switches used for high-voltages.

* Mineral oil is used as a brake fluid in some cars, such as Citroën models with hydrodynamic suspension, and bicycle disc brakes.

* Mineral oil is burned in specialized machines (both manufactured and home-made) to produce a thick white smoke that is then blown into automotive evaporative emissions (EVAP) systems to find leaks.

* It is used for polishing alabaster in stonework and lubricating and cleaning pocket knives or food handling tools that use an open bearing, thus needing periodic lubrication. Light mineral oil (paraffinum perliquidum) is used as a honing oil when sharpening edge tools (such as chisels) on abrasive oil stones. Mineral oil USP or light mineral oil can be used as an anti-rust agent for their blades.

* It is an inexpensive alternative for storing reactive metals, such as the alkali metals, lithium, potassium and sodium.

* Horticultural oil is often made with mineral oil as the active ingredient. It is sprayed on plants to control scale, aphid, and other pest populations by suffocation.

* Before the widespread adoption of thermocyclers with heated lids, it was common practice to use mineral oil to overlay polymerase chain reactions in biotechnology to prevent loss of water during heating cycles. It is often used to suspend crystals for use in X-ray crystallography.

* It is used as a transparent collision material for reactions in particle physics, as in the MiniBooNE neutrino oscillation experiment.

* As a relatively low heat combustible with no flavor or odor, mineral oil can be used in entertainments for fire breathing and “fire dancing” act, but there is a risk of injury.

* Paraffin oil is commonly used to fill Galileo thermometers: Due to paraffin oil&#x27;s freezing temperature being lower than that of water (approx. ), this makes them less susceptible to freezing during shipment, or when stored in a cold environment.

<doc id="212420" wikidata="Q471379" url="?curid=212420" title="The Scream">
<text>The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The Norwegian name of the piece is &#x27; (Scream), and the German title under which it was first exhibited is &quot;&quot;&#x27; (The Scream of Nature). The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch&#x27;s work, including &quot;The Scream&quot;, had a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.

Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun&#x27;s light turned the clouds &quot;a blood red&quot;. He sensed an &quot;infinite scream passing through nature&quot;. Scholars have located the spot along a fjord path overlooking Oslo and have suggested various explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister&#x27;s commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.

Munch created two versions in paint and two in pastels, as well as a lithograph stone from which several prints survive. Both painted versions have been stolen from public museums, but since recovered. In 2012, one of the pastel versions commanded the highest nominal price paid for an artwork at a public auction at that time.

==Sources of inspiration==
In his diary in an entry headed &quot;Nice 22 January 1892&quot;, Munch wrote:

He later described his inspiration for the image:

Some scholars believe, based upon these accounts, that Munch was describing a terrifying emotional experience that would today be called a panic attack.

Among theories advanced to account for the reddish sky in the background is the artist&#x27;s memory of the effects of the powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about a decade before Munch painted &quot;The Scream&quot;. This explanation has been disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had seen. Another explanation for the red skies is that they are due to the appearance of nacreous clouds which occur at the latitude of Norway and which look remarkably similar to the skies depicted in &quot;The Scream&quot;. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity of both a slaughterhouse and a lunatic asylum to the site depicted in the painting may have offered some inspiration. The scene was identified as being the view from a road overlooking Oslo, by the Oslofjord and Hovedøya, from the hill of Ekeberg. At the time of painting the work, Munch&#x27;s manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was a patient at the mental asylum at the foot of Ekeberg.

In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum suggested that the strange, skeletal creature in the foreground of the painting was inspired by a Peruvian mummy, which Munch, like Paul Gauguin, could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin&#x27;s paintings, among those the central figure in his painting &quot;Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles)&quot; and for the old woman at the left in his 1897 painting &quot;Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?&quot;. In 2004, Italian anthropologist Piero Mannucci speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence&#x27;s Museum of Natural History which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. However, later studies have disputed that theory, as Munch did not visit Florence until after painting &quot;The Scream&quot;.

The imagery of &quot;The Scream&quot; has been compared to that which an individual suffering from depersonalization disorder experiences, a feeling of distortion of the environment and one&#x27;s self.

Arthur Lubow has described &quot;The Scream&quot; as &quot;an icon of modern art, a &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; for our time.&quot; It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern humanity.

==Versions==
Munch created four versions, two in paint and two in pastels. The first version was painted in 1893, between Berlin in Germany and Åsgårdstrand in Norway. It was exhibited the same year, alongside other artworks in a series which Munch called &quot;The Frieze of Life&quot;. It is in the collection of the National Museum of Norway in Oslo. This is the version that has the barely visible pencil inscription (&quot;could only have been painted by a madman&quot;). A pastel version from that year, which may have been a preliminary study, is in the collection of the Munch Museum, also in Oslo. The second pastel version, from 1895, was sold for $119,922,600 at Sotheby&#x27;s Impressionist and Modern Art auction on 2 May 2012 to financier Leon Black. The second painted version dates from 1910, during a period when Munch revisited some of his prior compositions. It is also in the collection of the Munch Museum. These versions have seldom traveled, though the 1895 pastel was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from October 2012 to April 2013, and the 1893 pastel was exhibited at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in 2015.

Additionally, Munch created a lithograph stone of the composition in 1895 from which several prints produced by Munch survive. Only approximately four dozen prints were made before the original stone was resurfaced by the printer in Munch&#x27;s absence.

The material composition of the 1893 painted version was examined in 2010. The pigment analysis revealed the use of cadmium yellow, vermilion, ultramarine and viridian, among other pigments in use in the 19th century.

==Pencil inscription==
The version held by the National Museum of Norway has a pencil inscription, in small lettering, in the upper left corner, saying (&quot;could only have been painted by a madman!&quot;). It can only be seen on close examination of the painting. This had been presumed to be a comment by a critic or a visitor to an exhibition. It was first noticed when the painting was exhibited in Copenhagen in 1904, eleven years after this version was painted. Following infrared photography, the study of the handwriting now shows that the comment was added by Munch. The theory has been put forward that Munch added the inscription after the critical comments made when the painting was first exhibited in Norway in October 1895. There is good evidence that Munch was deeply hurt by that criticism, being sensitive to the mental illness that was prevalent in his family.

==Thefts==

&quot;The Scream&quot; has been the target of several thefts and theft attempts. Some damage has been suffered in these thefts.

===1994 theft===
On 12 February 1994, the same day as the opening of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, two men broke into the National Gallery, Oslo, and stole its version of &quot;The Scream&quot;, leaving a note reading &quot;Thanks for the poor security&quot;. The painting had been moved down to a second-story gallery as part of the Olympic festivities. After the gallery refused to pay a ransom demand of US$1 million in March 1994, Norwegian police set up a sting operation with assistance from the British police (SO10) and the Getty Museum and the painting was recovered undamaged on 7 May 1994. In January 1996, four men were convicted in connection with the theft, including Pål Enger, who had been convicted of stealing Munch&#x27;s &quot;Love and Pain&quot; in 1988. They were released on appeal on legal grounds: the British agents involved in the sting operation had entered Norway under false identities.

===2004 theft===
The 1910 version of &quot;The Scream&quot; was stolen on 22 August 2004, during daylight hours, when masked gunmen entered the Munch Museum in Oslo and stole it and Munch&#x27;s &quot;Madonna&quot;. A bystander photographed the robbers as they escaped to their car with the artwork. On 8 April 2005, Norwegian police arrested a suspect in connection with the theft, but the paintings remained missing and it was rumored that they had been burned by the thieves to destroy evidence. On 1 June 2005, with four suspects already in custody in connection with the crime, the city government of Oslo offered a reward of 2 million Norwegian krone (roughly US$313,500 or €231,200) for information that could help locate the paintings. Although the paintings remained missing, six men went on trial in early 2006, variously charged with either helping to plan or participating in the robbery. Three of the men were convicted and sentenced to between four and eight years in prison in May 2006, and two of the convicted, Bjørn Hoen and Petter Tharaldsen, were also ordered to pay compensation of 750 million kroner (roughly US$117.6 million or €86.7 million) to the City of Oslo. The Munch Museum was closed for ten months for a security overhaul.

On 31 August 2006, Norwegian police announced that a police operation had recovered both &quot;The Scream&quot; and &quot;Madonna&quot;, but did not reveal detailed circumstances of the recovery. The paintings were said to be in a better-than-expected condition. &quot;We are 100 percent certain they are the originals,&quot; police chief Iver Stensrud told a news conference. &quot;The damage was much less than feared.&quot; Munch Museum director Ingebjørg Ydstie confirmed the condition of the paintings, saying it was much better than expected and that the damage could be repaired. &quot;The Scream&quot; had moisture damage on the lower left corner, while &quot;Madonna&quot; suffered several tears on the right side of the painting as well as two holes in Madonna&#x27;s arm. Before repairs and restoration began, the paintings were put on public display by the Munch Museum beginning 27 September 2006. During the five-day exhibition, 5,500 people viewed the damaged paintings. The conserved works went back on display on 23 May 2008, when the exhibition &quot;Scream and Madonna – Revisited&quot; at the Munch Museum in Oslo displayed the paintings together.

In 2008 Idemitsu Petroleum Norge AS committed an endowment of 4 million Norwegian krone towards the conservation, research and presentation of &quot;The Scream&quot; and &quot;Madonna&quot;.

==Record sale at auction==
The 1895 pastel-on-board version of the work, owned by Norwegian businessman Petter Olsen, sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in London for a record price of nearly US$120 million at auction on 2 May 2012. The bidding started at $40 million and lasted for over 12 minutes when American businessman Leon Black by phone gave the final offer of US$119,922,500, including the buyer&#x27;s premium. Sotheby&#x27;s described the work as &quot;the most colorful and vibrant&quot; of the four versions Munch painted, noting also his hand-colouring of the frame on which he inscribed his poem which detailed the picture&#x27;s inspiration. After the sale, Sotheby&#x27;s auctioneer Tobias Meyer said the work was &quot;worth every penny&quot;, adding: &quot;It is one of the great icons of art in the world and whoever bought it should be congratulated.&quot; 

The auction was contested by the heirs of Hugo Simon, who sold it to Norwegian ship owner Thomas Olsen, Petter&#x27;s father, &quot;around 1937&quot;. 

The previous record for the most expensive work of art sold at auction had been held by Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Nude, Green Leaves and Bust&quot;, which went for US$106.5 million at Christie&#x27;s two years prior on 4 May 2010. As of 2018, the pastel remains the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction. The work had a presale estimate of $80 million, the biggest presale estimate ever set by Sotheby&#x27;s.

==In popular culture==
In Philip K. Dick&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, the main character and his partner, Phil Resch, view the painting in an art gallery. Resch comments that the painting reminds him of how he imagines androids feel.

In the late twentieth century, &quot;The Scream&quot; was imitated, parodied, and (following the expiration of its copyright) outright copied, which led to it acquiring an iconic status in popular culture. It was used on the cover of some editions of Arthur Janov&#x27;s 1970 book &quot;The Primal Scream&quot;.

In 1983–1984, pop artist Andy Warhol made a series of silk screen prints copying works by Munch, including &quot;The Scream&quot;. His stated intention was to desacralize the painting by making it into a mass-reproducible object. Munch had already begun that process, however, by making a lithograph of the work for reproduction. Erró&#x27;s ironic and irreverent treatment of Munch&#x27;s masterpiece in his acrylic paintings &quot;The Second Scream&quot; (1967) and &quot;Ding Dong&quot; (1979) is considered a characteristic of post-modern art. The expression of Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) in the poster for the 1990 film &quot;Home Alone&quot; was inspired by &quot;The Scream&quot;.

The principal alien antagonists depicted in the 2011 BBC series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, named &quot;The Silence&quot;, have an appearance partially based on &quot;The Scream&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;The Scream&quot; was one of four paintings that the Norwegian postal service chose for a series of stamps marking the 150th anniversary of Edvard Munch&#x27;s birth. In 2018 Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis made a musical based on the painting&#x27;s theft starring Pål Enger who stole it in 1994.

A patient resource group for trigeminal neuralgia (which has been described as the most painful condition in existence) have also adopted the image as a symbol of the condition.

In most renderings, the emoji is made to resemble the subject of the painting.
A simplified version of the subject of the painting is one of the pictographs that was considered by the US Department of Energy for use as a non-language-specific symbol of danger to warn future human civilizations of the presence of radioactive waste.

The cover art for the 2018 MGMT album &quot;Little Dark Age&quot; shows a figure resembling the subject of the painting, albeit in clown-like makeup.

Despite popular opinion to the contrary, the Ghostface mask worn by the primary antagonists of the &quot;Scream&quot; series of horror was not inspired by the Munch painting. The mask, discovered by Marianne Maddalena and Wes Craven, was created in 1991 by Brigitte Sleiertin of the Fun World novelty company for the Halloween market. She based her concept drawings on old cartoons, such as those created by Max Fleischer.

<text>Noah Thomas Porter III (December 14, 1811 – March 4, 1892) was an American Congregational minister, academic, philosopher, author, lexicographer and an outspoken anti-slavery activist. Porter Mountain, of the Adirondack Mountains, was named for him after he was the first to climb it in 1875. He was President of Yale College (1871–1886).

==Biography==
He was born to Noah Porter Jr. (1781–1866) (one of the first ministers of First Church of Christ, Congregational in Farmington, Connecticut) and his wife, born Mehitable Meigs, in Farmington, Connecticut, on December 14, 1811. His younger sister was Sarah Porter, founder of Miss Porter&#x27;s School, a college preparatory school for girls. He graduated in 1831 from Yale College, where he was a member of the Linonian Society. On April 13, 1836, in New Haven, he married Mary Taylor, daughter of Nathaniel Taylor (who presided over the creation of the Yale Divinity School and created what came to be known as &quot;New Haven theology&quot;) and his wife Rebecca Marie Hine. They had several children, and two daughters survived them.

He was ordained as a Congregational minister in New Milford, Connecticut, from 1836 to 1843. He served as pastor at a Congregational Church in Springfield, Massachusetts, from 1843 to 1846. He was elected professor of moral philosophy and metaphysics at Yale in 1846.

Porter was inaugurated as President of Yale College on Wednesday, October 11, 1871. He continued to serve as head of the college until 1886.

Porter edited several editions of Webster&#x27;s Dictionary, and wrote on education.

Influenced by the German refugee writer and philosopher Francis Lieber, Porter opposed slavery and integrated an antislavery position with religious liberalism.

He was a frequent visitor to the Adirondack Mountains of New York, and in 1875 was among the first recorded to make an ascent of the peak later named Porter Mountain in his honor.

His best-known work is &quot;The Human Intellect&quot;, with an &quot;Introduction upon Psychology and the Human Soul&quot; (1868), comprehending a general history of philosophy, and following in part the &quot;common-sense&quot; philosophy of the Scottish school, while accepting the Kantian doctrine of intuition, and declaring the notion of design to be &quot;a priori&quot;. Of great importance were two other works, &quot;Elements of Intellectual Science&quot; (1871) and &quot;Elements of Moral Science&quot; (1885).

He died on March 4, 1892, in New Haven, and was buried in the Grove Street Cemetery there.

<text>Xanclomys is a small mammal from the Paleocene of North America. It was a genus within the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and family Neoplagiaulacidae.

The genus &quot;Xanclomys&quot;, named by Rigby J.K. in 1980, is also known as &quot;Xancolomys&quot;. The identification is based on a single species, &quot;Xanclomys mcgrewi&quot;. Fossil remains were found in the Torrejonian (Paleocene)-age strata of the Swain Quarry in Wyoming (U.S.). Affinities are uncertain. There&#x27;s perhaps a second, unnamed species.

<doc id="212427" wikidata="Q235544" url="?curid=212427" title="Flame">
<text>A flame () is the visible, gaseous part of a fire. It is caused by a highly exothermic chemical reaction made in a thin zone. When flames are hot enough to have ionized gaseous components of sufficient density, they are then considered plasma.

==Mechanism==

Color and temperature of a flame are dependent on the type of fuel involved in the combustion. For example, when a lighter is held to a candle, the applied heat causes the fuel molecules in the candle wax to vaporize. In this state they can then readily react with oxygen in the air, which gives off enough heat in the subsequent exothermic reaction to vaporize yet more fuel, thus sustaining a consistent flame. The high temperature of the flame causes the vaporized fuel molecules to decompose, forming various incomplete combustion products and free radicals, and these products then react with each other and with the oxidizer involved in the reaction of the following flame (fire).

One may investigate different parts of a candle flame with the aid of a cold metal spoon: the higher parts of the flame produce water vapor deposition, the result of combustion, the yellow parts in the middle produce soot, and the area near the candle wick produces unburned wax. Goldsmiths use higher parts of a flame with a metallic blow-pipe for melting gold and silver. Sufficient energy in the flame will excite the electrons in some of the transient reaction intermediates such as the methylidyne radical (CH) and diatomic carbon (C2), which results in the emission of visible light as these substances release their excess energy (see spectrum below for an explanation of which specific radical species produce which specific colors). As the combustion temperature of a flame increases (if the flame contains small particles of unburnt carbon or other material), so does the average energy of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the flame (see Black body).

Other oxidizers besides oxygen can be used to produce a flame. Hydrogen burning in chlorine produces a flame and in the process emits gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) as the combustion product. Another of many possible chemical combinations is hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide which is hypergolic and commonly used in rocket engines. Fluoropolymers can be used to supply fluorine as an oxidizer of metallic fuels, e.g. in the magnesium/teflon/viton composition.

The chemical kinetics occurring in the flame are very complex and typically involve a large number of chemical reactions and intermediate species, most of them radicals. For instance, a well-known chemical kinetics scheme, GRI-Mech, uses 53 species and 325 elementary reactions to describe combustion of biogas.

There are different methods of distributing the required components of combustion to a flame. In a diffusion flame, oxygen and fuel diffuse into each other; the flame occurs where they meet. In a premixed flame, the oxygen and fuel are premixed beforehand, which results in a different type of flame. Candle flames (a diffusion flame) operate through evaporation of the fuel which rises in a laminar flow of hot gas which then mixes with surrounding oxygen and combusts.

==Color==

Flame color depends on several factors, the most important typically being black-body radiation and spectral band emission, with both spectral line emission and spectral line absorption playing smaller roles. In the most common type of flame, hydrocarbon flames, the most important factor determining color is oxygen supply and the extent of fuel-oxygen pre-mixing, which determines the rate of combustion and thus the temperature and reaction paths, thereby producing different color hues.
In a laboratory under normal gravity conditions and with a closed air inlet, a Bunsen burner burns with yellow flame (also called a safety flame) with a peak temperature of about . The yellow arises from incandescence of very fine soot particles that are produced in the flame. Also, carbon monoxide is produced, and the flame tends to take oxygen from the surfaces it touches. When the air inlet is opened, less soot and carbon monoxide are produced. When enough air is supplied, no soot or carbon monoxide is produced and the flame becomes blue. (Most of this blue had previously been obscured by the bright yellow emissions.) The spectrum of a premixed (complete combustion) butane flame on the right shows that the blue color arises specifically due to emission of excited molecular radicals in the flame, which emit most of their light well below ≈565 nanometers in the blue and green regions of the visible spectrum.

The colder part of a diffusion (incomplete combustion) flame will be red, transitioning to orange, yellow, and white as the temperature increases as evidenced by changes in the black-body radiation spectrum. For a given flame&#x27;s region, the closer to white on this scale, the hotter that section of the flame is. The transitions are often apparent in fires, in which the color emitted closest to the fuel is white, with an orange section above it, and reddish flames the highest of all. A blue-colored flame only emerges when the amount of soot decreases and the blue emissions from excited molecular radicals become dominant, though the blue can often be seen near the base of candles where airborne soot is less concentrated.

Specific colors can be imparted to the flame by introduction of excitable species with bright emission spectrum lines. In analytical chemistry, this effect is used in flame tests (or flame emission spectroscopy) to determine presence of some metal ions. In pyrotechnics, the pyrotechnic colorants are used to produce brightly colored fireworks.

==Temperature==
When looking at a flame&#x27;s temperature there are many factors which can change or apply. An important one is that a flame&#x27;s color does not necessarily determine a temperature comparison because black-body radiation is not the only thing that produces or determines the color seen; therefore it is only an estimation of temperature. Other factors that determine its temperature are:

* In fires (particularly house fires), the cooler flames are often red and produce the most smoke. Here the red color compared to typical yellow color of the flames suggests that the temperature is lower. This is because there is a lack of oxygen in the room and therefore there is incomplete combustion and the flame temperature is low, often just . This means that a lot of carbon monoxide is formed (which is a flammable gas) which is when there is greatest risk of backdraft. When this occurs, combustible gases at or above the flash point of spontaneous combustion are exposed to oxygen, carbon monoxide and superheated hydrocarbons combust, and temporary temperatures of up to occur.

===Common flame temperatures===

This is a rough guide to flame temperatures for various common substances (in air at 1 atm. pressure):

===Highest temperature===
Dicyanoacetylene, a compound of carbon and nitrogen with chemical formula C4N2 burns in oxygen with a bright blue-white flame at a temperature of , and at up to in ozone. This high flame temperature is partially due to the absence of hydrogen in the fuel (dicyanoacetylene is not a hydrocarbon) thus there is no water among the combustion products.

Cyanogen, with the formula (CN)2, produces the second-hottest-known natural flame with a temperature of over when it burns in oxygen.

===Cool flames===

At temperatures as low as , fuel-air mixtures can react chemically and produce very weak flames called cool flames. The phenomenon was discovered by Humphry Davy in 1817. The process depends on a fine balance of temperature and concentration of the reacting mixture, and if conditions are right it can initiate without any external ignition source. Cyclical variations in the balance of chemicals, particularly of intermediate products in the reaction, give oscillations in the flame, with a typical temperature variation of about , or between &quot;cool&quot; and full ignition. Sometimes the variation can lead to an explosion.

==In microgravity==

In the year 2000, experiments by NASA confirmed that gravity plays an indirect role in flame formation and composition. The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a flame (such as in a candle in normal gravity conditions), making it yellow. In microgravity or zero gravity environment, such as in orbit, natural convection no longer occurs and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become bluer and more efficient. There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is the hypothesis that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than do diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in microgravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and private industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.

==Thermonuclear flames==

Flames do not need to be driven only by chemical energy release. In stars, subsonic burning fronts driven by burning light nuclei (like carbon or helium) to heavy nuclei (up to iron group) propagate as flames. This is important in some models of Type Ia supernovae. In thermonuclear flames, thermal conduction dominates over species diffusion, so the flame speed and thickness is determined by the thermonuclear energy release and thermal conductivity (often in the form of degenerate electrons).

<text>Xyronomys is an extinct genus of small mammals from the Paleocene of North America, with two described species. The genus lies within the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and family Neoplagiaulacidae.

The species &quot;Xyronomys swainae&quot; (J. K. Rigby, 1980) was found in Torrejonian (Paleocene)-age strata of Swain Quarry in Wyoming, United States. Represented by a couple of teeth, this genus was originally assigned to Eucosmodontidae. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (2001, p. 406) refer it to Neoplagiaulacidae on the basis of its possession of microprismatic enamel, i.e. the tooth enamel is built up from small prisms.

A second species &quot;Xyronomys robinsoni&quot; was found in Puercan (Lower Paleocene)-age strata of Colorado, US and was named by Middleton and Dewar in 2004.

Material assigned to this genus has also been reported from Rav W-1 in Saskatchewan, Canada.

<text>Goldwin Smith (13 August 1823 – 7 June 1910) was a British-born academic and historian who was active in both Great Britain and North America. From 1856 to 1866, he was a professor of modern history at the University of Oxford. Smith taught at Cornell University from 1868 to 1872, and was instrumental in establishing the university&#x27;s international reputation, but left when it began admitting female students. He is the namesake of Goldwin Smith Hall at Cornell University, and was outspoken regarding his often controversial political views. Smith was a supporter of the Union during the American Civil War and a critic of imperialism. He was also opposed to the Irish Home Rule movement and women&#x27;s suffrage, along with holding Anglo-Saxonist and antisemitic views.

==Early life and education==

Smith was born at Reading, Berkshire. He was educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and after a brilliant undergraduate career he was elected to a fellowship at University College, Oxford. He threw his energy into the cause of university reform with another fellow of University College, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley. On the Royal Commission of 1850 to inquire into the reform of the university, of which Stanley was secretary, Smith served as assistant-secretary; and he was then secretary to the commissioners appointed by the act of 1854. His position as an authority on educational reform was further recognised by a seat on the Popular Education Commission of 1858. In 1868, when the question of reform at Oxford was again growing acute, he published a pamphlet, entitled &quot;The Reorganization of the University of Oxford&quot;.

In 1865, he led the University of Oxford opposition to a proposal to develop Cripley Meadow north of Oxford railway station for use as a major site of Great Western Railway (GWR) workshops. His father had been a director of GWR. Instead the workshops were located in Swindon. He was public with his pro-Northern sympathies during the American Civil War, notably in a speech at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester in April 1863 and his &quot;Letter to a Whig Member of the Southern Independence Association&quot; the following year.

Besides the Universities Tests Act 1871, which abolished religious tests, many of the reforms suggested, such as the revival of the faculties, the reorganisation of the professoriate, the abolition of celibacy as a condition of the tenure of fellowships, and the combination of the colleges for lecturing purposes, were incorporated in the act of 1877, or subsequently adopted by the university. Smith gave the counsel of perfection that &quot;pass&quot; examinations ought to cease; but he recognised that this change &quot;must wait on the reorganization of the educational institutions immediately below the university, at which a passman ought to finish his career.&quot; His aspiration that colonists and Americans should be attracted to Oxford was later realised by the will of Cecil Rhodes. On what is perhaps the vital problem of modern education, the question of ancient versus modern languages, he pronounced that the latter &quot;are indispensable accomplishments, but they do not form a high mental training&quot; – an opinion entitled to peculiar respect as coming from a president of the Modern Language Association.

==Oxford years==

He held the Regius professorship of Modern History at Oxford from 1858 to 1866, that &quot;ancient history, besides the still unequalled excellence of the writers, is the &#x27;best instrument for cultivating the historical sense.&quot; As a historian, indeed, he left no abiding work; the multiplicity of his interests prevented him from concentrating on any one subject. His chief historical writings – &quot;The United Kingdom: a Political History&quot; (1899), and &quot;The United States: an Outline of Political History&quot; (1893) — though based on thorough familiarity with their subject, make no claim to original research, but are remarkable examples of terse and brilliant narrative. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1865.

The outbreak of the American Civil War proved a turning point in his life. He quickly began championing the Union cause, and his pamphlets, especially one entitled &quot;Does the Bible Sanction American Slavery?&quot; (1863), played a prominent part in hardening British public opinion against the Confederate States of America. Visiting America on a lecture tour in 1864, he received an enthusiastic welcome, and was entertained at a public banquet in New York. Andrew Dickson White, president of Cornell University at Ithaca, N.Y., invited him to take up a teaching post at the newly founded institution. But it was not until a dramatic change in Smith&#x27;s personal circumstances that led to his departure from England in 1868, that he took up the post. He had resigned his chair at Oxford in 1866 in order to attend to his father, who had suffered permanent injury in a railway accident. In the autumn of 1867, when Smith was briefly absent, his father took his own life. Possibly blaming himself for the tragedy, and now without an Oxford appointment, he decided to move to North America.

==Cornell years==
Smith&#x27;s time at Cornell was brief, but his impact there was significant. He held the professorship of English and Constitutional History in the Department of History at Cornell University from 1868 to 1872. The addition of Smith to Cornell&#x27;s faculty gave the newly opened university &quot;instant credibility.&quot; Smith was something of an academic celebrity, and his lectures were sometimes printed in New York newspapers. During Smith&#x27;s time at Cornell he accepted no salary and provided much financial support to the institution. 

In 1869, he had his personal library shipped from England and donated to the university. He lived at Cascadilla Hall among the students, and was much beloved by them. In 1871 Smith moved to Toronto to live with relatives, but retained an honorary professorship at Cornell and returned to campus frequently to lecture. When he did, he insisted on staying with the students at Cascadilla Hall rather than in a hotel. Smith bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the University in his will.

Smith&#x27;s abrupt departure from Cornell was credited to several factors, including the Ithaca weather, Cornell&#x27;s geographic isolation, Smith&#x27;s health, and political tensions between Britain and America. But the decisive factor in Smith&#x27;s departure was the university&#x27;s decision to admit women. Goldwin Smith told White that admitting women would cause Cornell to &quot;sink at once from the rank of a University to that of an Oberlin or a high school&quot; and that all &quot;hopes of future greatness&quot; would be lost by admitting women.

On June 19, 1906, Goldwin Smith Hall was dedicated, at the time Cornell&#x27;s largest building and its first building dedicated to the humanities, as well as the first home to the College of Arts and Sciences. Smith personally laid the cornerstone for the building in October 1904 and attended the 1906 dedication. The &quot;Cornell Alumni News&quot; observed on the occasion, &quot;To attempt to express even in a measure the reverence and affection which all Cornellians feel for Goldwin Smith would be attempting a hopeless task. His presence here is appreciated as the presence of no other person could be.&quot;

==Life in Toronto==
In Toronto, Smith edited the &quot;Canadian Monthly&quot;, and subsequently founded the &quot;Week&quot; and the &quot;Bystander&quot;, and where he spent the rest of his life living in The Grange manor.

In 1893, Smith was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. In his later years he expressed his views in a weekly journal, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Sun&quot;, and published in 1904 &quot;My Memory of Gladstone&quot;, while occasional letters to the &quot;Spectator&quot; showed that he had lost neither his interest in English politics and social questions nor his remarkable gifts of style. He died at his residence in Toronto, The Grange.

==Political views==

He continued to take an active interest in English politics. As a Liberal, he opposed Benjamin Disraeli, and was a strong supporter of Irish Disestablishment, but refused to follow Gladstone in accepting Home Rule. He expressly stated that &quot;if he ever had a political leader, his leader was John Bright, not Mr Gladstone.&quot; Causes that he powerfully attacked were Prohibition, female suffrage and state socialism, as he discussed in his &quot;Essays on Questions of the Day&quot; (revised edition, 1894). He also published sympathetic monographs on William Cowper and Jane Austen, and attempted verse in &quot;Bay Leaves and Specimens of Greek Tragedy&quot;. In his &quot;Guesses at the Riddle of Existence&quot; (1897), he abandoned the faith in Christianity that he had expressed in his lecture of 1861, &quot;Historical Progress&quot;, in which he forecast the speedy reunion of Christendom on the &quot;basis of free conviction,&quot; and wrote in a spirit &quot;not of Agnosticism, if Agnosticism imports despair of spiritual truth, but of free and hopeful inquiry, the way for which it is necessary to clear by removing the wreck of that upon which we can found our faith no more.&quot;

===Anglo-Saxonism===

Smith is considered by historian Edward P. Kohn to be a &quot;devout Anglo-Saxonist&quot;, a racial belief system developed by British and American intellectuals, politicians and academics in the 19th century. In his view, Smith defined the &quot;Anglo-Saxon race&quot; as not necessarily being limited to English people, but extended to the Welsh and Lowland Scots, though not the Irish. Speaking in 1886, he proclaimed that he was standing &quot;by the side of John Bright against the dismemberment of the great Anglo-Saxon community of the West, as I now stand against the dismemberment of the great Anglo-Saxon community of the East.&quot; These words formed the key to his views of the future of the British Empire and he was a leading member of the anti-imperialist &quot;Little Englander&quot; movement.

Smith thought that Canada was destined by geography to become part of the United States. In his view, separated by artificial north–south barriers, into zones communicating naturally with adjoining portions of the United States, Canada was an artificially constructed and badly-governed nation. In his view, it would eventually break away from the British Empire, and the &quot;Anglo-Saxons&quot; of the North American continent would become one nation. These views are most fully developed in his work &quot;Canada and the Canadian Question&quot; (1891). Smith&#x27;s views on the future of Canada–United States relations was criticised by Canadian priest George Monro Grant in the &quot;Canadian Magazine&quot;.

===Imperialism===
Smith identified as an anti-imperialist, describing himself as &quot;anti-Imperialistic to the core&quot;. Despite this, he admired aspects of the British Empire; speaking on the topic of British rule in India, Smith claimed that &quot;it is the noblest the world has seen... Never had there been such an attempt to make conquest the servant of civilization. About keeping India there is no question. England has a real duty there.&quot; Smith remained resolutely opposed to Britain granting more representative government to India, expressing fear that this would lead to a &quot;murderous anarchy.&quot;

When the Second Boer War (1899-1902) broke out, Smith published several articles in the Canadian press and a book &quot;In The Court of History: An Apology of Canadians Opposed to the Boer War&quot; (1902) expressing his opposition to the war. Arguing against British involvement in the war on pacifist grounds, Smith&#x27;s views were uncommon among the English Canadian community of the period. Smith published another anti-imperialist work in 1902, &quot;Commonwealth or Empire?&quot;, arguing against the United States assuming an imperialistic foreign policy in the aftermath of its victory in the Spanish–American War.

===Antisemitism===
Smith held strong anti-Semitic views. Described by McMaster University professor Alan Mendelson as &quot;the most vicious anti-Semite in the English-speaking world&quot;, Smith referred to Jews as &quot;parasites&quot; who absorb &quot;the wealth of the community without adding to it&quot;. Research by Glenn C. Altschuler and Isaac Kramnick has studied Smith&#x27;s writings on Jews, which claimed that they were responsible for a form of &quot;repulsion&quot; they provoked in others, due to his assertion of their &quot;peculiar character and habits&quot;, including a &quot;preoccupation with money-making&quot;, which made them &quot;enemies of civilization&quot;. He also denigrated &quot;brit milah&quot;, a Jewish ritual of circumcision, as a &quot;barborous rite&quot;, and proposed either culturally assimilating Jews or deporting them to Palestine as a solution to the &quot;Jewish problem&quot;.

Smith wrote that &quot;The Jewish objective has always been the same, since Roman times. We regard our race as superior to all humanity, and we do not seek our ultimate union with other races, but our final triumph over them.&quot; He had a strong influence on William Lyon Mackenzie King and Henri Bourassa. He proposed in other writings that Jews and Arabs were of the same race. He also believed that Islamic oppression of non-Muslims was for economic factors. In December 2020, the Cornell University Board of Trustees voted to remove Smith&#x27;s name from the honorific titles of twelve professors at Cornell. The Board took this action in recognition of Smith&#x27;s &quot;racist, sexist and anti-Semitic&quot; views. The Board declined to rename Goldwin Smith Hall.

=== Antisuffragism ===
Smith was strongly opposed to the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, both in the United Kingdom and in the United States. In 1874, he published a treatise in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; titled &quot;Female Suffrage&quot; in opposition to a proposed bill on women&#x27;s suffrage. In the treatise, he explained his view that &quot;The very foundations of society are touched when change is proposed in the relations of the sexes.&quot;

==Legacy==
Goldwin Smith is credited with the quote &quot;Above all nations is humanity,&quot; an inscription that was engraved in a stone bench he offered to Cornell in May 1871. The bench sits in front of Goldwin Smith Hall, named in his honour. This quote is the motto of the University of Hawaii and other institutions around the world (for example, the Cosmopolitan Club at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign).

Another stone bench inscribed with the motto, sits on the campus of Boğaziçi University in Istanbul. It sits with a clear view down onto the city.

After his death, a plaque in his memory was erected outside his birthplace in the town centre of Reading. This still exists, outside the entrance to the Harris Arcade.

<text>Edward Bouverie Pusey (; 22 August 180016 September 1882) was an English Anglican cleric, for more than fifty years Regius Professor of Hebrew at the University of Oxford. He was one of the leading figures in the Oxford Movement, with interest in sacramental theology and typology.

==Early years==
He was born at Pusey House in the village of Pusey in Berkshire (now administratively a part of Oxfordshire). His father, Philip Bouverie-Pusey, who was born Philip Bouverie and died in 1828, was a younger son of Jacob des Bouverie, 1st Viscount Folkestone; he adopted the name of &quot;Pusey&quot; on succeeding to the manorial estates there. His mother, Lady Lucy Pusey, the only daughter of Robert Sherard, 4th Earl of Harborough, was the widow of Sir Thomas Cave, 7th Baronet, MP before her marriage to his father in 1798. Among his siblings was older brother Philip Pusey and sister Charlotte married Richard Lynch Cotton.

Pusey attended the preparatory school of the Rev. Richard Roberts in Mitcham. He then attended Eton College, where he was taught by Thomas Carter, father of Thomas Thellusson Carter. For university admission he was tutored for a period by Edward Maltby.

In 1819 Pusey became a commoner of Christ Church, a college at the University of Oxford, where Thomas Vowler Short was his tutor. He graduated in 1822 with a first in Greats.
==Fellow and professor==
During 1823 Pusey was elected by competition to a fellowship at Oriel College, Oxford. John Henry Newman and John Keble were already there as fellows.

Between 1825 and 1827, Pusey studied Oriental languages and German theology at the University of Göttingen. A claim that, during the 1820s, only two Oxford academics knew German, one being Edward Cardwell, was advanced by Henry Liddon; but was not well evidenced, given that Alexander Nicoll, ignored by Liddon, corresponded in German.

In 1828 Pusey took holy orders, and he married soon afterwards. His opinions had been influenced by German trends in theology. That year, also, the Duke of Wellington as Prime Minister appointed Pusey as Regius Professor of Hebrew at Oxford, with the associated canonry of Christ Church.

==Oxford Movement==
By the end of 1833, Pusey began sympathising with the authors of the &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot;. He published Tract XVIII, on fasting, at the end of 1833, adding his initials (until then the tracts had been unsigned). &quot;He was not, however, fully associated with the movement till 1835 and 1836, when he published his tract on baptism and started the &quot;Library of the Fathers&quot;&quot;.

When John Henry Newman quit the Church of England for the Roman Catholic church around 1841, Pusey became the main promoter of Oxfordianism, with better access to religious officials than John Keble with his rural parsonage. But Pusey himself was a widower, having lost his wife in 1839, and much affected by personal grief. Oxfordianism was known popularly as &quot;Puseyism&quot; and its adherents as &quot;Puseyites&quot;. Some occasions when Pusey preached at his university marked distinct stages for the High Church philosophy he promoted. The practice of confession in the Church of England practically dates from his two sermons on &quot;The Entire Absolution of the Penitent&quot;, during 1846, which both revived high sacramental doctrine and advocated revival of the penitential system which medieval theologians had appended to it. The 1853 sermon on &quot;The Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist&quot;, first formulated the doctrine which became largely the basis for the theology of his devotees, and transformed the practices of Anglican worship.

==Controversialist==
Pusey studied the Church Fathers, and the Caroline Divines who revived traditions of pre-Reformation teaching. His sermon at the university during May 1843, &quot;The Holy Eucharist, a Comfort to the Penitent&quot; caused him to be suspended for two years from preaching. The condemned sermon soon sold 18,000 copies.

In 1843 Pusey received the vows of Marian Hughes, who was the first Anglican woman to make these since the reformation. She went on to be mother superior at an order she founded in Oxford.

Pusey was involved with theological and academic controversies, occupied with articles, letters, treatises and sermons. He was involved with the Gorham controversy of 1850, with the question of Oxford reform during 1854, with the prosecution of some of the writers of &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;, especially of Benjamin Jowett, during 1863, and with the question as to the reform of the marriage laws from 1849 to the end of his life.

By reviving the doctrine of the Real Presence, Pusey contributed to the increase of ritualism in the Church of England. &quot;Puseyite&quot;, became a term for Anglican Ritualists: &quot;&quot;great in puerilities, when he bows and when he stands&quot;, and &quot;half papist and half protestant&quot;&quot;. He had little sympathy with ritualists, however, and protested that as part of a university sermon of 1859. He came to defend those who were accused of violating the law by their practice of ritual; but the Ritualists largely ignored the actual Puseyites.

==Later life and legacy==
Pusey edited the &quot;Library of the Fathers&quot;, a series of translations of the work of the Church fathers. Among the translators was his contemporary at Christ Church, Charles Dodgson. He also befriended and assisted Dodgson&#x27;s son &quot;Lewis Carroll&quot; when he came to Christ Church. When Dodgson Sr. mourned the death of his wife (Carroll&#x27;s mother), Pusey wrote to him:
Not a great orator, Pusey compelled attention by his earnestness. His major influence was as a preacher and spiritual adviser, for which his correspondence was enormous. In private life his habits were simple almost to austerity. He had few personal friends, and rarely mingled with general society; though harsh to opponents, he was gentle to those who knew him, and gave freely to charities. His main characteristic was a capacity for detailed work.
From 1880 Pusey was seen by only a few persons. His strength gradually decreased, and he died on 16 September 1882, after a brief illness. He was buried at Oxford in the cathedral of which he had been a canon for 54 years. In his memory his friends purchased his library, and bought for it a house in Oxford, now Pusey House. It was endowed with funds for librarians, who were to perpetuate in the university Pusey&#x27;s principles.

Edward Bouverie Pusey is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 16 September.

==Works==
Pusey&#x27;s first work, &quot;An Historical Enquiry into the Probable Causes of the Rationalist Character Lately Predominant in the Theology of Germany&quot; of 1828, was an answer to Hugh James Rose&#x27;s Cambridge lectures on rationalist tendencies in German theology. Rose&#x27;s &quot;State of Protestantism in Germany Described&quot; has been called &quot;over-simplified and polemical&quot;, and Pusey had been encouraged by German friends to reply. Pusey showed sympathy with the Pietists; misunderstood, he was himself accused of having rationalist opinions. During 1830 he published a second part of the &quot;Historical Enquiry&quot;.

Other major works by Pusey were:

*two books on the Eucharist, &quot;The Doctrine of the Real Presence&quot; (1855) and &quot;The Real Presence ... the Doctrine of the English Church&quot; (1857); 
*&quot;Daniel the Prophet&quot;, supporting the traditional historical dating of the Book of Daniel; 
*&quot;The Minor Prophets, with Commentary&quot;, on the Twelve Minor Prophets, his main contribution as Professor of Hebrew; 
* the &quot;Eirenicon&quot;, an endeavour to find a basis of union between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church;
*&quot;What is of Faith as to Everlasting Punishment: In Reply to Dr. Farrar&#x27;s Challenge in His &quot;Eternal Hope&quot;, 1879&quot; (1881), in the controversy over everlasting punishment on &quot;Eternal Hope&quot; (1878) by Frederic William Farrar

&quot;Christus consolator&quot; (1883) was published after his death, edited by his godson and friend George Edward Jelf.

In addition to his original works, Pusey also published multiple translations as part of the Library of the Fathers series, including of the Confessions by St. Augustine.

==Family==
Pusey married during 1828 Maria Catherine Barker (1801–1839), daughter of Raymond Barker of Fairford Park; they had a son and three daughters. His son, Philip Edward (1830–1880), edited an edition of Saint Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s commentary on the minor prophets.

<text>James McIntyre (baptised 25 May 1828 – 31 March 1906) was a Scottish poet who emigrated to Upper Canada in 1851. He is sometimes called &quot;The Cheese Poet&quot;, as cheese was a recurring theme in many of his poems.

== Life and works ==

McIntyre was born in Forres, Scotland, in 1828 and immigrated to Upper Canada. He worked as a hired hand to begin with, performing pioneer chores that formed the basis of a number of his works. Later, he settled in St. Catharines, Upper Canada, where he dealt in furniture. There he married and had a daughter and son John William McIntyre.

He later moved to Ingersoll, then a town of 5,000 on the banks of the Thames in Oxford County; depending on when he moved it was either in Upper Canada or Canada West, the heart of Canadian dairy country at the time. He opened a furniture factory on the river as well as a store which sold furniture, along with such items as pianos and coffins.

He was well loved in the community, from which he often received aid in hard times, due in part to his poesy and oratorical skills—he was called on to speak at every kind of social gathering in Ingersoll. The region seems to have inspired him, and it was in celebration of the proud history of Canada, the natural beauty and industry of the region, and especially (as noted above) its cheese, that the majority of his &quot;oeuvre&quot; was written.

:&quot;The ancient poets ne&#x27;er did dream&quot;
:&quot;That Canada was land of cream,&quot;
:&quot;They ne&#x27;er imagined it could flow&quot;
:&quot;In this cold land of ice and snow,&quot;
:&quot;Where everything did solid freeze&quot;
:&quot;They ne&#x27;er hoped or looked for cheese.&quot;
:: from &quot;Oxford Cheese Ode&quot;

The Toronto &quot;Globe&quot; ran his pieces as comic relief, and the New York &quot;Tribune&quot; expressed amusement, but their mockery did not dampen his enthusiasm. He is assumed to have continued writing until his death, in 1906.

He published two volumes of poetry:

:&quot;Musings on the Canadian Thames&quot; (1884);
:&quot;Poems of James McIntyre&quot; (1889).

McIntyre was forgotten after his death for a number of years, until his work was rediscovered and reprinted by William Arthur Deacon—literary editor of the Toronto &quot;Mail and Empire&quot; and its successor &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;—in his book &quot;The Four Jameses&quot; (1927).

In recent years a volume of his work, &quot;Oh! Queen of Cheese: Selections from James McIntyre, the Cheese Poet&quot; (ed. Roy A. Abramson; Toronto: Cherry Tree, 1979) collected his poems together with a variety of cheese recipes and anecdotes. However, the greatest boost to his fame probably came from a number of his poems being anthologized in the collection &quot;Very Bad Poetry&quot;, edited by Ross and Kathryn Petras (Vintage, 1997). This included his masterpiece and possibly best-known poem, &quot;Ode on the Mammoth Cheese Weighing Over 7,000 Pounds&quot;, written about an actual cheese produced in Ingersoll in 1866 and sent to exhibitions in Toronto, New York, and Britain:

:&quot;We have seen thee, Queen of Cheese,&quot;
:&quot;Lying quietly at your ease,&quot;
:&quot;Gently fanned by evening breeze;&quot;
:&quot;Thy fair form no flies dare seize.&quot;

:&quot;All gaily dressed, soon you&#x27;ll go&quot;
:&quot;To the provincial show,&quot;
:&quot;To be admired by many a beau&quot;
:&quot;In the city of Toronto.&quot;
::from &quot;Ode on the Mammoth Cheese&quot;

== Legacy ==

An annual poetry contest is held in Ingersoll, Ontario, to honour McIntyre. The contest is sponsored by &quot;The Ingersoll Times&quot; and the Corporation of the Town of Ingersoll, and includes a cheese-themed poetry competition.

<text>Hugh James Rose (9 June 1795 – 22 December 1838) was an English Anglican priest and theologian who served as the second Principal of King&#x27;s College, London.

==Life==
Rose was born at Little Horsted in Sussex on 9 June 1795 and educated at Uckfield School, where his father was Master, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was conferred the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1817, but missed a fellowship. He was then President of the Cambridge Union Society for the Michaelmas term of 1817. Having been ordained to the deaconate in 1818, he was appointed to a curacy in Buxted, Sussex, in 1819. He married Anne Cuyler and became a priest later that year. In 1821, he was appointed to the vicarage of Horsham, Sussex.

After travelling in Germany, as select preacher at Cambridge, Rose delivered four addresses against rationalism. In 1827 he was appointed to the prebendary of Middleton, which he held until 1833. In 1830 he accepted the rectory of Hadleigh, Suffolk, and in 1833 that of Fairsted, Essex, and in 1835 the perpetual curacy of St Thomas&#x27;s, Southwark. Rose was a high churchman, who in 1832 founded the &quot;British Magazine&quot; to propagate his views, and so came into touch with the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Out of a conference at his rectory in Hadleigh, Suffolk came the Association of Friends of the Church, formed by Hurrell Froude and William Palmer.

In 1833–1834 Rose was professor of divinity at the University of Durham, a post which had to resign due to ill-health. He was appointed Principal of King&#x27;s College, London, in October 1836, but caught influenza, and after two years of ill-health he died in Florence, Italy, on 22 December 1838. He was buried in the English Cemetery, Florence, his name in the register given as &quot;Ugo Giacomo Rose&quot;, his Scipio tomb having a lengthy epitaph in Latin. Rose&#x27;s library was sold at auction in London by R. H. Evans on 28 February 1839 (and five following days); a copy of the catalogue is held at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.145(1)).

==Works==
In 1825 Rose published &quot;The State of the Protestant Religion in Germany&quot;. The book was severely criticised in Germany, and in England by Edward Pusey. Together with William Rowe Lyall he edited Rivington&#x27;s Theological Library (1832–46). In 1836 he became editor of the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot;, and he projected the &quot;New General Biographical Dictionary&quot;, a scheme carried through by his brother Henry John Rose (1800–1873).

<text>James Harrison Rigg (16 January 1821 – 7 April 1909) was an English nonconformist minister and Methodist educator.

==Life==
He was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 16 January 1821, was son of John Rigg, a Methodist minister there, by his second wife Anne, daughter of James McMullen, Irish Methodist missionary at Gibraltar. Brought up in straitened circumstances, the boy was for five years (1830–5) a pupil and for four years (1835-9) a junior teacher at the Kingswood school for preachers&#x27; sons near Bristol. In 1839, he became assistant in the Rev. Firth&#x27;s Academy, Hartstead Moor, near Leeds, and having made an unsuccessful effort to conduct a school of his own at Islington, London, he became in 1843 classical and mathematical master at John Conquest&#x27;s school at Biggleswade. In July 1845, he entered the Methodist ministry as probationer, and being ordained on 1 August 1849, served in successive circuits at Worcester, Guernsey, Brentford, Stockport, Manchester, Folkestone, and Tottenham.
From an early date Rigg read widely and wrote much on religious and theological themes. A vigorous and clear style gave his writings influence in his denomination. He was a chief contributor to the &quot;Biblical Review&quot; (1846–9), and frequently wrote in the Wesleyan newspaper, the &quot;Watchman.&quot; Contributing to the first number of the &quot;London Quarterly Review,&quot; a Wesleyan Methodist periodical, in September 1853, he soon joined its editorial staff (1868), was co-editor with Dr. William Burt Pope (1883–6), and ultimately sole editor (1886–98).

Rigg explained his theological position in three suggestive volumes: &quot;Principles of Wesleyan Methodism&quot; (1850; 2nd edit. 1851), &quot;Wesleyan Methodism and Congregationalism contrasted&quot; (1852), and &quot;Modern Anglican Theology&quot; (1857; 3rd edit. 1880). In the last, which discussed the historical development of the Church of England, he criticised the broad-church teaching of F. D. Maurice, Charles Kingsley and Benjamin Jowett; his differences with Kingsley were considerately expressed, Kingsley sought his acquaintance, and Rigg stayed with him at Eversley.

In 1866, Rigg republished many periodical articles as &quot;Essays for the Times on Ecclesiastical and Social Subjects,&quot; and in 1869 he issued &quot;Churchmanship of John Wesley&quot; (new edit. 1879). His literary work was early valued in America. He acted as English correspondent of the &quot;New Orleans Christian Advocate&quot; (1851) and of the &quot;New York Christian Advocate&quot; (1857–76). In 1865, he received the degree of D.D. from Dickinson College.
In 1868, Rigg was appointed principal of the (Wesleyan) Westminster Training College for day school teachers and he used that role to encourage his daughter Caroline Rigg to also be a leading teacher. Rigg led the Westminster Training College till 1903. 

In matters of education, he acquired an expert knowledge and was an active controversialist. When the first elementary education act was passed in 1870, Rigg took the traditional Wesleyan view, opposing secularism and favouring denominational schools, although without sympathy for sectarian exclusiveness. 
From William Arthur and Hugh Price Hughes, both of whom supported the transfer of Wesleyan schools to the school board as created in 1870, he differed profoundly. 
He pressed his views, in correspondence, on the attention of Gladstone and W. E. Forster, and the Wesleyan conference supported him. 
In 1870, he was elected a member for Westminster on the first London School Board, and served in that capacity till 1876. With the help of Professor Huxley and W. H. Smith, M.P., he secured the provision of a syllabus of religious instruction. 
In 1873, he summarised this attitude in &quot;National Education in its Social Conditions and Aspects.&quot; 
Subsequently he was a member of the royal commission on elementary education (1886-8), over which Sir Richard Cross presided and which reported in favour of the school board management as against the voluntary system.
In the general administration of Wesleyan affairs Rigg was recognised to be a statesmanlike leader of liberal-conservative temper. 
Elected chairman of the Kent district in 1865, he was made a member of the legal hundred in 1866. 
In 1878, he was elected President of the Methodist Conference, and the unusual distinction was paid him of re-election in 1892. 
From 1877 until 1896, with two brief intervals, he was chairman of the second London district, and from 1881 to 1909 he was treasurer of the Wesleyan Missionary Society. 

In controversies concerning the internal organisation of the Wesleyan church Rigg took a middle course. 
He met the demand of the &#x27;progressive&#x27; section under Hugh Price Hughes for an enlarged participation of the laity in the work of the conference, by proposing and carrying the &#x27;Sandwich Compromise&#x27; in 1890, which ’sandwiched&#x27; a representative lay session between the two sittings of the pastoral session. 
The compromise lasted till 1901, when the liberal section prevailed and conference was opened by ministers and laymen together, though the pastoral session still retained the privilege of electing the president. 
Rigg&#x27;s proposal of 1894, in which Hughes supported him, to exempt chairmen of districts from circuit duties and leave them free to exercise supervision over the district, was rejected by the conference from a suspicion that Rigg&#x27;s &#x27;separated chairmen&#x27; had a colour of episcopacy. Rigg&#x27;s own position in the matter was defined in his &quot;Comparative View of Church Organisation. Primitive and Protestant&quot; (1887; 3rd edit. 1896). 
With Hughes and the progressive party Rigg&#x27;s relations were often strained. Writing privately to Cardinal Manning, a colleague on the education commission, on the education question, December 1888, he described Hughes as &#x27;your intemperate temperance coadjutor, our methodist firebrand.&#x27; The unauthorised publication of the letter in Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; of the cardinal (1895) led to reprisals by Hughes, who wrote in the &quot;Methodist Times&quot; an article on &quot;The Self-Revelation of Dr. Rigg.&quot; At Rigg&#x27;s request the letter was withdrawn from later editions of Purcell&#x27;s book, and Hughes and he were reconciled.
Rigg, whose somewhat rough manner caused even friendly admirers to liken him to Dr. Johnson, never abated his literary energies amid his varied activities. 
For many years he was a member of the committee of the London Library. 

He died on 17 April 1909, at 79 Brixton Hill, where he had lived since 1889, and was buried in Norwood cemetery. 

==Family==
He married, on 17 June 1851, Caroline, daughter of John Smith, alderman of Worcester. 
She died on 17 December 1889, leaving two daughters and a son. 
The elder daughter, Caroline Edith Rigg, was head-mistress of the Mary Datchelor School and Training College, Camberwell ; and the son, James McMullen, was a barrister-at-law. 

==Works==
The chief publications of his later life were : 
*&quot;The Living Wesley&quot; (1875; re-issued as &quot;The Centennial Life of Wesley&quot; in 1891 ) ; 
*&quot;Discourses and Addresses on Religion and Philosophy&quot; (1880) ; 
*&quot;Character and Life-work of Dr. Pusey&quot; (1893) ; 
*&quot;Oxford High Anglicanism and its Chief Leaders&quot; (1895 ; 2nd edit. 1899), an interesting study and the only attempt made by a nonconformist to write a history of the Oxford movement. Rigg was a severe critic of Newman.

There followed &quot;Reminiscences sixty Years ago&quot; (1904), and &quot;Jabez Bunting, a short Biography&quot; (1905). 

Rigg also wrote the article on &quot;Methodism&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (9th edit.).

<text>Robert Pacho (August 1, 1911 – May 1, 1978) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1928 to 1941, twice challenging for the welterweight world title in 1939. After Bert Colima&#x27;s career was over, Pacho was Mexican fans&#x27; most popular boxer.

==Early life==
Pacho broke into the professional boxing ranks while working as a farm mechanic in El Centro, California.

==Professional career==
Pacho fought many well known fighters during his career, including legends Barney Ross, and Henry Armstrong. His career lasted from 1929–1941 and his professional record was 78-67-15 with 37 Knockouts.

His two bouts with Henry Armstrong were for the world Welterweight title, one held in Havana, Cuba. Pacho lost both by fourth round technical knockout.

<doc id="212443" wikidata="Q6309841" url="?curid=212443" title="Julius Hare (theologian)">
<text>Julius Charles Hare (13 September 1795 – 3 January 1855) was an English theological writer.

==Early life==
He was born at Valdagno, near Vicenza, in Italy. His parents were Francis Hare-Naylor and the painter Georgiana Shipley, a daughter of Bishop Shipley. Augustus William Hare was his brother, and his great-grandfather, Francis Hare, was bishop of St Asaph.

He came to England with his parents in 1799, but in 1804/05 spent a winter with them at Weimar, Germany, where he met Goethe and Schiller, and took an interest in German literature which influenced his style and sentiments throughout his career. On the death of his mother in 1806, Julius was sent to Tonbridge School, where he remained until 1812, when he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. There he became fellow in 1818, and after another trip abroad he began to read law in London in the following year. From 1822 to 1832 he was assistant tutor at Trinity College.

==Career==
Turning from law to divinity, Hare took holy orders in 1826; and, on the death of his uncle in 1832, he succeeded to the rich family living of Herstmonceux in Sussex, where he accumulated a library of some 12,000 volumes, especially rich in German literature. Before taking up residence in his parish at Buckwell Place, he went abroad again, and in Rome he met Chevalier Bunsen, who afterwards dedicated to him part of his work, &quot;Hippolytus and his Age&quot;. In 1840 Hare was appointed archdeacon of Lewes, and in the same year preached a series of sermons at Cambridge (&quot;The Victory of Faith&quot;), followed in 1846 by a second, &quot;The Mission of the Comforter&quot;. The published versions did not achieve much popularity. In 1844, Hare married Esther, a sister of his friend Frederick Maurice.

Hare was a member of the Canterbury Association from March 1848. In 1851 he was collated to a prebend in Chichester; and in 1853 he became one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s chaplains.

==Views and works==
Julius Hare belonged to what has been called the &quot;Broad Church party,&quot; though some of his opinions approach those of the Evangelical Arminian school, while others seem vague and undecided. He was one of the first Britons to recognize and be influenced by German thought and speculation, and, amidst an exaggerated alarm of German heresy, helped vindicate the authority of the sounder German critics. His writings, which are chiefly theological and controversial, consist mainly of sermons on different topics; though valuable and full of thought, they lose some of their force by the cumbersome German structure of the sentences.

In 1827 &quot;Guesses at Truth by Two Brothers&quot; was published with his brother. The work, initially published anonymously, consisted of essays, aphorisms, and literary studies. A revised edition appeared in 1838 dedicated to William Wordsworth, who began to read it &quot;with great pleasure and profit.&quot; Hare assisted Connop Thirlwall, afterwards Bishop of St David&#x27;s, in translating the first and second volumes of Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot; (1828 and 1832), and published a &quot;Vindication of Niebuhr&#x27;s History&quot; in 1829. He wrote many similar works, among which is a &quot;Vindication of Luther against his recent English Assailants&quot; (1854). In 1848 he edited the &quot;Remains of John Sterling&quot;, who had formerly been his curate. Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Life of John Sterling&quot; (1851) was written out of dissatisfaction at the overemphasis on doctrinal questions in the biography of Sterling that Hare wrote for his 1848 volume, and, especially, at the obsession with theological matters by contemporary &quot;Religious Newspapers, and Periodical Heresy-hunters&quot; that discussed Hare&#x27;s book. &quot;Memorials of a Quiet Life&quot;, published in 1872 by Augustus Hare, contain accounts of the Hare family.

Hare also translated a number of tales by Ludwig Tieck.

<text>Tell England: A Study in a Generation is a novel written by Ernest Raymond and published in February 1922 in the United Kingdom. Its themes are the First World War and the young men sent to fight in it.

The book became a bestseller, some 300,000 copies being sold by the end of 1939. Forty editions were printed by Cassell between 1922 and 1969, prior to the first impression printed by Corgi in 1973. A film adaptation of the same title was released in 1931.

==Plot summary==
Following a short prologue, the body of the novel is divided into two halves (or &quot;books&quot;), both narrated by Rupert Ray. The first book tells the story of his and his friends&#x27; progress through school; while the second deals with the experiences of (specifically) Ray and his friend Edgar Doe during the war.

===Prologue===
The prologue is written in the voice of Padre Monty, an army chaplain who is a character from Book II. He writes affectionately and retrospectively of the three boys Rupert Ray, Edgar Doe and Archibald Pennybet as they were in childhood. The inference is that he has acquired this information from the boys&#x27; mothers, given that he first meets Ray and Doe in the Great War.

===Book I: &quot;Five gay years of school&quot;===
The first book contains many of the elements of the classic school story, describing the lives of Rupert Ray and his friends as they progress through their public school, Kensingstowe, and the pranks they play on the masters. Raymond spends much of the novel setting up the characters and their relationships in this way.

Rupert himself is a shy boy, lacking in courage and in need of moral guidance in the absence of a father figure. Edgar Doe, nicknamed the &quot;Grey Doe&quot;, is equally shy, but is more sensitive and inclined to fall in love with older men such as their strict master Radley. Both boys are heavily influenced by the older Archibald &quot;Penny&quot; Pennybet, who enjoys wielding youthful power over others by stirring up acts of mischief. Rupert&#x27;s school career includes an ongoing feud with his housemaster (known as &quot;Carpet Slippers&quot;), receiving beatings and punishments, learning to do what is right, and – his greatest hour – winning the school relay swimming race, only to be disqualified, but then made a prefect on account of his maturity in dealing with the disappointment. Radley is a heavy influence in all this, offering Rupert advice and encouragement to make the right choices. In one episode, the entire class has been cheating in Carpet Slippers&#x27; history lessons, only for Rupert to admit his guilt by recording a mark of zero after Radley&#x27;s prompting. The book repeatedly makes dark suggestions as to the boys&#x27; future after school. For example, at the end of a triumphant cricket match the masters at Kensingstowe consider what England will do with the young men they are moulding. Radley himself is a weary, beaten figure when he learns that his favourite pupils, Ray and Doe, are off to war.

===Book II: &quot;And the rest – war&quot;===
When the war breaks out it is treated with much excitement, and the boys leave school to join the army as officers. Raymond&#x27;s enthusiastic portrayal represents an attitude widespread at the time. It is encapsulated in a speech by the boys&#x27; new commanding officer, the Colonel:

Ray and Doe are posted to Gallipoli, and despite Ray&#x27;s pain at leaving his mother, and his clear worry that he will never see her again, they are still optimistic and eager to join the fight. The news that Pennybet has been killed at Neuve Chapelle on the Western Front, and that three of their schoolmates (their house captain, their school&#x27;s most promising cricketer, and Rupert&#x27;s relay-team captain) have all died in April in Gallipoli dampens their spirits. There is a bitter irony in this passage, for all three possessed promising lives that were snuffed out the moment they landed on the beaches.

In the East, the boys spend months in a camp on the island of Lemnos waiting for any action, but are finally sent to Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula, where they find themselves up against &quot;Asiatic Annie&quot;, a 7-mile ranging Turkish gun, and another well-placed gun that kills many of their friends. Doe accepts a promotion to Bombing Officer with characteristic enthusiasm. Ray is promoted to Captain. They are both junior subalterns, the rank that suffered the greatest losses in the Great War, owing to their courage and visibility as leaders of the front line. As the Germans break through Serbia, and British and French troops at Gallipoli begin to withdraw, Doe and Ray&#x27;s unit is ordered to launch an attack as a diversion. Doe breaks over the top of the line and is shot in the shoulder. He falls, but manages to get up and blow up the offending Turkish gun. He is then shot four more times in the waist. Padre Monty rushes out to bring him out of no man&#x27;s land. Doe subsequently dies, but not before Ray has a tearful final farewell with his best friend.

When leaving Gallipoli, Ray is charged by Padre Monty to tell England about what has happened. &quot;You must write a book and tell &#x27;em, Rupert, about the dead schoolboys of your generation.&quot;

The end of the novel is written from a trench on the Western Front in 1918, just as the Allies are about to defeat Germany and end the Great War. Rupert intimates that he has finished his story in time, but it is not revealed whether he survives this final passage of war. We are asked to believe that he is happy because he has lived, experienced beauty, known the purest of friendships and had twenty glorious years. The book ends on that note.

==Title==
The novel&#x27;s title is taken from an epitaph by Edmund Garrett that is inscribed on the grave of one of Doe and Ray&#x27;s friends, and is presumably also inscribed on Doe&#x27;s, given that he had asked Ray to do so. It reads:
==Dedication==

The novel is dedicated &quot;to the memory of REGINALD VINCENT CAMPBELL CORBET who fell, while a boy, in the East and GEORGE FREDERICK FRANCIS CORBET who passed, while a boy, in the West&quot;. The author, Ernest Raymond, named his narrator Rupert Ray in a thinly disguised reference to himself. It has been speculated, therefore, that the character Edgar Doe, who dies in Gallipoli (the East), is based on Reginald Corbet, while the character Archibald Pennybet, who dies on the Western Front, is based on George Corbet.

==Themes==
===Religion===
A major theme of the novel is religious redemption, and in the second half of the book Padre Monty becomes to Ray and Doe what Radley was at Kensingtowe. He teaches them about the communion and about confession, and achieves the unlikely feat of drawing confessions from both boys. Padre Monty views the pair as his greatest triumph, and is happy to be sending them out to battle &quot;white&quot; and pure. Still, both boys have their doubts about the approaching war as their ship draws nearer to Gallipoli. Doe is the enthusiast, with high aspirations but a sensitive heart. Ray is slightly heavier of spirits, but Padre Monty encourages him to seek beauty in everything.

When first informed that their battalion is being posted to the Gallipoli front, the Colonel explicitly paints the campaign in terms of a crusade:

===Male friendship and homoeroticism===
There is an underlying homoerotic flavour to much of the novel – especially Book I – with vivid descriptions of boys as magnificent creatures, God&#x27;s highest form of creation and Britain&#x27;s greatest accomplishment. Ray writes of the master, Radley:

A great part of the novel is a romantic ode to the friendship between Ray and Doe. Rupert&#x27;s love for Edgar is painted in classical hues as equivalent to that of Orestes who loved Pylades. The reader never feels that Ray&#x27;s feelings for Doe are sexual; but there are intimations in Doe&#x27;s unwillingness to confess to Padre Monty, and his admission that he has done &quot;everything&quot;, that he may himself be homosexual. At one point, the 13-year-old Doe admits: &quot;Do you know, I really think I like Radley better than anyone else in the world. I simply loved being whacked by him.&quot; Three years later, he enters into an enigmatically close friendship with another boy, Freedham. Pennybet attempts to explain this relationship to Ray: &quot;When you&#x27;re my age, Rupert, ... you&#x27;ll know that there are such things as degenerates and decadents. Freedham is one. And very soon Doe will be another.&quot; Later, Doe confesses to having got drunk and taken drugs with Freedham, adding: &quot;There are not many things we haven&#x27;t done together.&quot; The adult Doe is described by Ray as being &quot;as graceful as a girl and as sinuous as a serpent&quot;.

One of the final messages in the book is given by Padre Monty to Rupert Ray as a means of consoling him to Edgar&#x27;s death. He says that Rupert and Edgar&#x27;s friendship is more perfect &quot;because&quot; of Edgar&#x27;s death. Had they simply been school friends who went their separate ways, they would eventually have lost trace of one another. Instead, Edgar will forever be inscribed upon Ray&#x27;s memory as the war held them in deepening intimacy until the end.

Raymond later said that when he re-read the novel in the late 1960s, he was &quot;astonished by its latent homosexuality&quot;.

==Publication history==
The book was originally published by Cassell and Company. Forty editions were printed by Cassell between 1922 and 1969, prior to the first impression printed by Corgi in 1973. It was most recently reprinted in 2005, when it was republished by IndyPublish.com (). Raymond returned to the theme of Gallipoli and male friendship in his 1958 novel &quot;The Quiet Shore&quot;.

==Reception==
The novel received mixed reviews when first published. Hannen Swaffer, writing in the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot;, considered it &quot;a book of penetrating analysis, a volume that illumines the souls of thousands ... a book that will be read proudly wherever English people live ... a book which will live as long as our spoken tongue&quot;. In contrast, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; found it &quot;laughable – when it is not revolting by reason of the sentimentality with which the autobiography of Rupert Ray is sticky from cover to cover&quot;. Rose Macaulay, writing in the &quot;Daily News&quot;, thought it &quot;apparently by a rather illiterate and commonplace sentimentalist&quot;, and considered that the book had &quot;no beauty, and its silliness and bad taste are not the work of a writer&quot;. S. P. B. Mais thought it &quot;[a] quite unreadable novel about public school life and the war&quot;; while Francis Birrell judged it &quot;the most nauseating book to have come out of the war&quot;.

The book proved extremely popular with readers, and some 300,000 copies had been sold by the end of 1939. A film adaptation (of the same title) was released in 1931.

Among more recent commentators, Samuel Hynes in 1990 found the novel imbued with a &quot;spirit of Brookeish, schoolboy patriotism&quot;. Hugh Cecil in 1995 considered that Raymond&#x27;s account &quot;of golden youth going through what he innocently, but appropriately, called &#x27;Five Gay Years at School&#x27; before meeting their ends in a state of moral purity at Gallipoli, seems now absurd&quot;. Jenny Macleod in 2004 thought that the book &quot;now seems chauvinistic and bombastic&quot;. Edward Madigan in 2011 found it &quot;extremely sentimental&quot;, adding that it was &quot;difficult to take the deliriously impressionable protagonists seriously&quot;.

<text>Ptilodontidae is a family of primitive mammals within the extinct order Multituberculata. Representatives are known from the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene of North America.

The Ptilodontidae family was originally named Ptilodontinae and classified as a subfamily by Edward Drinker Cope in 1887. It was amended by Gregory and Simpson in 1926 to its current status.

In addition, Cope mistakenly classified the &quot;Ptilodus&quot; genus as a marsupial. He originally named it &quot;Chirox&quot;, and placed it in the new family Chirogidae in 1887. Since it has been reclassified, and Chirogidae is now officially a synonym of Ptilodontidae.

One of the most outstanding features of this family of squirrel-like, arboreal mammals, was the peculiar shape of their last lower premolar. It was larger and more elongated than its neighbours, and its occlusive surface was formed into a serrated slicing blade. Most likely this tooth was used for crushing and opening seeds and nuts, but it is believed that the ptilodonts, like most small multituberculates, supplemented their diet with insects, worms, and fruits.

<text>Riverside Park, located in Dawson Springs, Kentucky, was originally built in 1914 to serve as a spring training park for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1914 to 1917. Sometimes referred to as Tradewater Park, it is the only known baseball park in Kentucky to have hosted a major league team since the Louisville Colonels folded in . While the original stadium was destroyed in a flood in the 1930s, it was later rebuilt in 1999. Like the original stadium, the rebuilt park is reconstructed out of wood. It is the only ballpark of its kind in Western Kentucky.

==History==
===Initial park===
Dawson Springs is home to a mineral spring that was believed by many to have medical healing qualities. This led to it becoming a huge resort town. Thousands of people came to drink and bathe in the spring. Forty hotels sprung up to accommodate the tourists. The Pittsburgh Pirates seeing these large crowds decided to make Dawson Springs their spring training home.

In Riverside Park was built to serve as the spring training venue for the Pirates. The entire ballpark was made entirely from wood, from the grandstand to the dugout. Local citizens then constructed a large indoor pavilion for spring training and exhibition games and an additional wing was built onto the New Century Hotel to accommodate the players. Teams soon came from St. Louis, Chicago, Kansas City, Louisville, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Philadelphia, as well as minor league squads from Columbus, Ohio and Toledo, Ohio to play the Pirates at Riverside Park. These teams consisted of other major league squads, American Association teams, colleges, semi-professional teams, and even teams formed by local mining companies and businesses. Hall of Famer Honus Wagner and his friends often went fishing at the Old Mill Dam, located right beside Riverside Park and a short walking distance from the New Century Hotel. Wagner, who trained on this field for 3 years, organized a team of local young boys known as &quot;Honus Wagners&#x27; Young Recruits.&quot; Several other future members of the Hall of Fame including; Babe Ruth, &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson, Casey Stengel, and Ty Cobb also played baseball at Riverside Park.

The team remained there through spring training of the 1916 season. The following season, the Pirates trained at Barrs Field, located in Jacksonville, Florida. Records also show that some major league teams played expedition games at Riverside Park until the early 1920s; the Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds. Riverside Park then hosted many local teams, among them the Dawson Springs Resorters of the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League, continued to provide baseball for western Kentucky.

In the 1930s a devastating storm flooded a river that runs alongside the field&#x27;s first base line. The flood washed away the entire stadium. In the decades following the flood, residents in Dawson Springs were only left with the memories of the ballpark, as there was effort to rebuild the park.

===Rebuilt park===
In 1999 Dawson Springs&#x27; Mayor Stacia Peyton funded a public project to rebuild the park, to help preserve the history of the city. While public opinion reflected the need for the city to fund other civic needs, instead of rebuilding an old ballpark, Peyton pressed ahead with the plan. The goal of the project was to make the stadium as authentic as possible to the original. Riverside Park was rebuilt using the exact blueprints from the original 1914 design. The largest stumbling block for the engineers reconstructing the park was building the field entirely of wood, just like it had been in 1914. The rebuilt stadium&#x27;s seats, roof, and beams were all made from wood, to create a one-of-a kind ballpark. It is currently the only completely wooden ballpark in the region.

The stadium was used until 2012 by the Tradewater Pirates of the KIT League and then the Ohio Valley League. The team was founded in 1999 and joined the KIT League in 2007. The Pirates&#x27; first game at Riverside was held on July 4, 1999. In 2008, the team celebrated its 10th anniversary. The club folded in 2012.

<doc id="212448" wikidata="Q67409" url="?curid=212448" title="Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen">
<text>Christian Charles Josias, [[Baron]] von Bunsen (; 25 August 1791 – 28 November 1860), was a German diplomat and scholar. He worked in the Papal States and England for a large part of his career.

==Life==
===Early life===
Bunsen was born at Korbach, an old town in the German principality of Waldeck. His father was a farmer driven by poverty to become a soldier. Having studied at the Korbach gymnasium (a type of superior state grammar school) and Marburg University, Bunsen went in his nineteenth year to Göttingen, where he studied philosophy under Christian Gottlob Heyne, and supported himself by teaching and later by acting as tutor to William Backhouse Astor, John Jacob&#x27;s son. Bunsen had been recommended to Astor by Heyne. He won the university prize essay of the year 1812 with his treatise, &quot;De Iure Atheniensium Hœreditario&quot; (“Athenian Law of Inheritance”), and a few months later the University of Jena granted him the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy.

During 1813 he traveled extensively with Astor in Germany and Italy. On his return to Göttingen, he and his friends formed the nucleus of a philological and philosophical society, and he pursued a vast system of kindred studies, including Semitic and Sanskrit philology. He studied the religion, laws, language, and literature of the Teutonic races, perfecting his knowledge of the Scandinavian languages on a visit to Denmark and Sweden. He had read Hebrew when a boy, and now worked at Arabic at Munich, Persian at Leiden, and Norse at Copenhagen. At Vienna he met Friedrich von Schlegel; at Munich, Schelling and Thiersch; and he joined the latter in studying Persian, and read law with Feuerbach.

===Rome===
Historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr&#x27;s work and character had aroused Bunsen&#x27;s enthusiasm, and at the close of 1815 he went to Berlin, to show Niebuhr the plan of research which he had mapped out. He remained some months in the company of the historian. Niebuhr was so impressed with Bunsen&#x27;s ability that, two years later, when he became Prussian envoy to the papal court, he made the young scholar his secretary. The intervening years Bunsen spent in assiduous labour among the libraries and collections of Paris and Florence, where he again joined Astor. When Astor returned to the United States, Bunsen became the French teacher of a Mr. Cathcart, an English gentleman. In 1816, he continued his studies of Persian and Arabic in Paris under Sylvestre de Sacy.

In July 1817 he married Frances Waddington, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Benjamin Waddington of Llanover, Monmouthshire, an English clergyman. The plan of an improved German translation of the Bible was first suggested to Bunsen by his young wife. Cornelius, Overbeck, Brandis, and Platner were the inseparable companions of the Bunsens. The Bunsens&#x27; lodgings in the Palazzo Caffarelli on the Capitoline Hill, where they lived 22 years, became a resort of many distinguished persons.

As secretary to Niebuhr, Bunsen was brought into contact with the Vatican movement for the establishment of the papal church in the Prussian dominions, to provide for the largely increased Catholic population. He was among the first to realize the importance of this new vitality on the part of the Vatican, and he made it his duty to provide against its possible dangers by urging upon the Prussian court the wisdom of fair and impartial treatment of its Catholic subjects. In this object he was at first successful, and both from the Vatican and from Frederick William III, who put him in charge of the legation on Niebuhr&#x27;s resignation, he received unqualified approbation.

Though not within the scope of the great plan of his life, Bunsen contributed largely to the &quot;Beschreibung der Stadt Rom&quot; (3 vols., 1830–43) the greater part of the topographical communications on ancient Rome, and all the investigations into the early history of Christian Rome. The first visit of the Egyptologist Champollion to Rome formed an epoch in Bunsen&#x27;s antiquarian studies. However, his argument in support of Champollion&#x27;s priority over Young was based upon an insufficient knowledge of Young&#x27;s publication dates. He became himself a zealous auditor of Champollion, and also encouraged Lepsius in the study of hieroglyphics. The Archaeological Institute, established in 1829, found in Bunsen its most active supporter. Bunsen founded the Protestant hospital on the Tarpeian Rock in 1835.

Owing partly to the wise statesmanship of Count Spiegel, archbishop of Cologne, an arrangement was made by which the thorny question of &quot;mixed&quot; marriages (i.e., between Catholic and Protestant) would have been happily solved; but the archbishop died in 1835, the arrangement was never ratified, and the Prussian king was foolish enough to appoint as Spiegel&#x27;s successor the narrow-minded partisan Baron Droste. The pope gladly accepted the appointment, and in two years the forward policy of the Jesuits had brought about the strife which Bunsen and Spiegel had tried to prevent. Bunsen rashly recommended that Droste should be seized, but the coup was so clumsily attempted, that the incriminating documents were, it is said, destroyed in advance. The government, in this impasse, took the safest course, refused to support Bunsen, and accepted his resignation in April 1838.

===England===
After leaving Rome, where he had become intimate with all that was most interesting in the cosmopolitan society of the papal capital, Bunsen went to England, where, except for a short term as Prussian ambassador to Switzerland (1839–1841), he spent the rest of his official life. The accession to the throne of Prussia of Frederick William IV, on 7 June 1840, made a great change in Bunsen&#x27;s career. Ever since their first meeting in 1828 the two men had been close friends and had exchanged ideas in an intimate correspondence, published under Ranke&#x27;s editorship in 1873. Enthusiasm for evangelical religion and admiration for the Anglican Church they held in common, and Bunsen was the instrument naturally selected for realizing the king&#x27;s fantastic scheme of setting up at Jerusalem a Prusso-Anglican bishopric as a sort of advertisement of the unity and aggressive force of Protestantism.

The special mission of Bunsen to England, from June to November 1841, was completely successful, in spite of the opposition of English Tractarians and Lutheran extremists. The Jerusalem bishopric, with the consent of the British government and the active encouragement of the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London, was duly established, endowed with Prussian and English money, and remained for some forty years an isolated symbol of Protestant unity and a rock of stumbling to Anglican Catholics.

During his stay in England Bunsen had made himself very popular among all classes of society, and he was selected by Queen Victoria, out of three names proposed by the king of Prussia, as ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s. In this post he remained for thirteen years. His tenure of the office coincided with the critical period in Prussian and European affairs which culminated in the revolutions of 1848. Bunsen had realized the significance of the signs that heralded these revolutions, and tried in vain to move Frederick William to a policy which would have placed him at the head of a Germany united and free. In Berlin in 1844, he had been asked to set forth his views on the question of granting a constitution to Prussia, and he had presented a series of memorials representing the need of a deliberative assembly, and had also made a plan of a constitution modeled on that of England.

With the visionary schemes of Frederick William, whether that of setting up a strict episcopal organization in the Evangelical Church in Prussia, or that of reviving the defunct ideal of the medieval Empire, Bunsen found himself increasingly out of sympathy. He felt bitterly the humiliation of Prussia by Austria after the victory of the reaction; and in 1852 he set his signature reluctantly to the treaty which, in his view, surrendered the &quot;constitutional rights of Schleswig and Holstein&quot;. His whole influence was now directed to withdrawing Prussia from the blighting influence of Austria and Russia, and attempting to draw closer the ties that bound her to Britain. On the outbreak of the Crimean War he urged Frederick William to throw in his lot with the western powers, and create a diversion in the north-east which would have forced Russia at once to terms. The rejection of his advice, and the proclamation of Prussia&#x27;s attitude of &quot;benevolent neutrality&quot;, led him in April 1854 to offer his resignation, which was accepted. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1853.

===Retirement===
Bunsen&#x27;s life as a public man was now practically at an end. He retired first to a villa on the Neckar near Heidelberg and later to Bonn. He refused to stand for a seat, in the Liberal interest, in the Lower House of the Prussian diet, but continued to take an active interest in politics, and in 1855 published in two volumes a work, &quot;Die Zeichen der Zeit: Briefe&quot;, etc., which exercised an immense influence in reviving the Liberal movement which the failure of the revolution had crushed. In September 1857 Bunsen attended, as the king&#x27;s guest, a meeting of the Evangelical Alliance at Berlin; and one of the last papers signed by Frederick William, before his mind gave way in October, was that which conferred upon him the title of baron and a peerage for life. In 1858, at the special request of the regent (afterwards the emperor) William, he took his seat in the Prussian House of Lords, and, though remaining silent, supported the new ministry, of which his political and personal friends were members.

Literary work was, however, his main preoccupation during all this period. Two discoveries of ancient manuscripts made during his stay in London, the one containing a shorter text of the &quot;Epistles of St Ignatius&quot;, and the other an unknown work &quot;On All the Heresies&quot;, by Bishop Hippolytus, had already led him to write his &quot;Hippolytus and his Age: Doctrine and Practice of Rome under Commodus and Severus&quot; (1852).

He now concentrated all his efforts upon a translation of the Bible with commentaries, the &quot;Bibelwerk&quot;. While this was in preparation he published his &quot;God in History&quot;, in which he contends that the progress of mankind marches parallel to the conception of God formed within each nation by the highest exponents of its thought. At the same time he carried through the press, assisted by Samuel Birch, the concluding volumes of his work (published in English as well as in German) &quot;Egypt&#x27;s Place in Universal History&quot;. This work contained a reconstruction of Egyptian chronology, together with an attempt to determine the relation in which the language and the religion of that country stand to the development of each among the more ancient non-Aryan and Aryan races. His ideas on this subject were most fully developed in two volumes published in London before he left England.

His greatest work, &quot;Bibelwerk für die Gemeinde&quot;, the first part of which was published in 1858, was intended to be completed in 1862. It had occupied his attention for nearly 30 years, as the grand center-point to which all his literary and intellectual energies were to be devoted, but he died before he could finish it. Three volumes of the &quot;Bibelwerk&quot; were published at his death. The work was completed in the same spirit with the aid of manuscripts under the editorship of Hollzmann and Kamphausen.

===Death===
In 1858 Bunsen&#x27;s health began to fail; visits to Cannes in 1858 and 1859 brought no improvement, and he died on 28 November 1860, in Bonn. One of his last requests having been that his wife would write down recollections of their common life, she published his &quot;Memoirs&quot; in 1868, which contain much of his private correspondence. The German translation of these &quot;Memoirs&quot; has added extracts from unpublished documents, throwing a new light upon the political events in which he played a part. Baron Humboldt&#x27;s letters to Bunsen were printed in 1869.

==Family==

Bunsen&#x27;s English connection, both through his wife (d. 1876) and through his own long residence in London, was further increased in his family. He had ten children, including five sons,
* Henry (1818–1855) became a clergyman and a naturalised Englishman.
*Ernest (1819–1903), in 1845 married an Englishwoman, Miss Gurney, subsequently resided and died in London. He was a scholarly writer, who published various works both in German and in English, notably on Aryan origins, Biblical chronology, and other questions of comparative religion. Ernest&#x27;s son, Sir Maurice de Bunsen (b. 1852), entered the English diplomatic service in 1877; and after a varied experience became minister at Lisbon in 1905. His youngest grand daughter through Maurice was Mary de Bunsen, World War Two Air Transport Auxiliary pilot and author.
* Karl (Charles; 1821–1887) had a career in the German diplomatic service.
* Georg (1824–1896) was for some time was an active politician in Germany, eventually retired to live in London. He wrote his father&#x27;s biography for the ninth edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. He was married to Emma Birkbeck and their grandson Ernest Henderson founded the Sheraton Hotels chain.
* Theodor (1832–1892) had a career in the German diplomatic service.
* Emilie (1827-1911).

<doc id="212453" wikidata="Q5474801" url="?curid=212453" title="Misère">
<text>Misère (French for &quot;destitution&quot;), misere, nullo, bettel, betl, &#x27; or &#x27; (German for &quot;beggar&quot;; equivalent terms in other languages include , and ) is a bid in various card games, and the player who bids misère undertakes to win no tricks or as few as possible, usually at no trump, in the round to be played. This does not allow sufficient variety to constitute a game in its own right, but it is the basis of such trick-avoidance games as Hearts, and provides an optional contract for most games involving an auction. The term or category may also be used for some card game of its own with the same aim, like Black Peter. 

A misère bid usually indicates an extremely poor hand, hence the name. An open or lay down misère, or misère ouvert is a 500 bid where the player is so sure of losing every trick that they undertake to do so with their cards placed face-up on the table. Consequently, &#x27;lay down misère&#x27; is Australian gambling slang for a predicted easy victory. 

In Skat, the bidding can result in a null game, where the bidder wins only if they lose every trick. (Conversely, the opponents win by forcing the bidder to take a trick.) In Swedish Whist, by contrast, a null game is one in which both teams try to take the fewest tricks. This variation is known as ramsch in Skat.

In Spades, bidding for no tricks is known as bidding nil, which if successful gives the bidder a bonus.

The word is first recorded in this sense in the rules for the game &quot;Boston&quot; in the late 18th century. It cannot be played in 6 hand 500.

== Misère game ==
A misère game or bettel game is a game that is played according to its conventional rules, except that it is &quot;played to lose&quot;; that is, the winner is the one who loses according to the normal game rules. Or, if the game is for more than two players, the one who wins according to the normal game rules loses. Such games generally have rulesets that normally encourage players to win; for example, most variations of checkers (draughts) require players to make a capture move if it is available; thus, in the misère variation, players can force their opponents to take numerous checkers through intentionally &quot;poor&quot; play.

In combinatorial game theory, a misère game is one played according to the &quot;misère play condition&quot;; that is, a player unable to move wins. (This is in contrast to the &quot;normal play condition&quot; in which a player unable to move loses.) Examples of games that use the misère play condition include Sylver coinage.

<text>Steve Nallon (born 8 November 1960) is a British actor, writer, voice artist and impressionist. Nallon began his career as a stand-up performer on the northern club circuit in the 1970s. 

He is known for his work as a voice artist on the satirical puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and for impersonating Margaret Thatcher on television throughout her time as Prime Minister of the UK (1979–1990). In his career Steve Nallon has performed a number of roles and characters as an actor and as a voice artist in theatre, film, television and radio.

==Early life==
Nallon grew up in a working-class family in Leeds in the 1960s. His father was a church caretaker who had a long history of mental health issues. His mother died suddenly in 1970 when Steve was nine years old. Because of his father&#x27;s mental instability it became necessary for Nallon and his sister to move in with their maternal grandparents. Nallon later described his early years as &quot;at times a tough and sometimes rocky childhood.&quot; After passing his 11-plus Nallon attended St. Michael&#x27;s College, a Jesuit school in Leeds. Whilst still at school, he developed a comedy act and performed from the age of 16 in local working men&#x27;s clubs in Yorkshire and the North.

In 1979, Nallon began studying Drama and English at the University of Birmingham.

==Career==
Nallon worked as a stand-up comedian on the northern club circuit in the 1970s. After taking a degree in English and Drama he had a short time in repertory theatre at Theatr Clwyd (1983) before becoming a founding member of the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; team in 1984. The series aired on the ITV network for twelve years from 1984 to 1996 and featured puppet caricatures of celebrities. Although Nallon became well known for providing the voice of Margaret Thatcher on the show, he also voiced many of the show&#x27;s other characters, including Roy Hattersley, The Queen Mother, Alan Bennett, David Attenborough, Harold Wilson, Bruce Forsyth, Robert Runcie, Edward Heath, Shirley Williams, David Frost and Malcolm Rifkind.

As an actor, Nallon has performed in several musicals including as Narrator in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; at Leicester Haymarket Theatre and as Jacque in &quot;Carnival&quot; as part of a staged reading at the Barbican. On film, he appeared as the family doctor in &quot;The Girl With Brains in Her Feet&quot;, a film about a talented teenage athlete who struggles to come to terms with the traumas of life. In 2015 he appeared as Professor Richards in the film &quot;51 Degrees North&quot;.

As a voice artist and puppeteer, Nallon has performed in various TV puppet series including &quot;Cats&#x27; Eyes&quot; (as Jimmy) BBC Two, &quot;The House of Gristle&quot; (as the mother) BBC One, &quot;Crazy Cottage&quot; (as Vera, the cuckoo) ITV, &quot;What&#x27;s Up Doc?&quot; (as Cassie) ITV, &quot;The Spooks of Bottle Bay&quot; (as Lady Dingledale, Lily, and Daffy Spook) ITV and &quot;Dan and Dusty&quot; (as Dusty) ITV.

As an established impersonator and impressionist Nallon has worked on various TV shows. In 2003 he was interviewed for the BBC One history of the comic impressionist &quot;Who Did You Do?&quot; presented by Ricky Gervais. Nallon featured on the BBC&#x27;s tribute to the art and craft of the impressionist, &quot;Night of a Thousand Faces&quot; (2001), and he guest starred on &quot;Alistair McGowan&#x27;s Big Impression&quot; series (2001) and &quot;The Impressionable Jon Culshaw&quot; series (2004). During the 1980s Steve worked with Rory Bremner on several series including &quot;Now Something Else&quot; and &quot;The Rory Bremner Show&quot;. 1985 he also appeared with Mike Yarwood on his final TV series for ITV. More recently Nallon voiced David Cameron on &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot;. Other voice artist credits include the video game &quot;Overlord&quot; and the mobile app &quot;Headcaster&quot; (2016) as David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn.

Nallon continues to perform in the guise of Margaret Thatcher. In 2011, he provided the voice of Thatcher for the film &quot;In Search of La Che&quot;, and in 2015 was cast as Thatcher in Jonathan Maitland&#x27;s play &quot;Dead Sheep&quot;. Nallon has provided the voice of Margaret Thatcher since 2011 in the BBC Radio Four series &quot;UK Confidential&quot; which examines Government Cabinet papers released under the 30-year rule. During Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s term in office Nallon appeared as Thatcher in &quot;The New Statesman&quot; with Rik Mayall. In 2016 voiced Thatcher for the national tour of the theatre dance show &quot;Coal&quot; created by Gary Clarke which included a section on the miners&#x27; strike of 1985.

Nallon has also worked as a writer. In 1989, Nallon co-wrote &quot;I, Margaret&quot; with Tom Holt, a spoof autobiography of Baroness Thatcher, published by Macmillan. In 1999, Nallon co-wrote &quot;The Ghost of Number Ten&quot; and &quot;The Nallon Tapes&quot; for BBC Radio Four. He performed all the voices in &quot;The Nallon Tapes&quot;, and in &quot;The Ghost of Number Ten&quot; he played the multi-voiced computer. Nallon has made contributions to &quot;New Statesman&quot; and the magazine &quot;Musical Stages&quot;.

In 2022, Nallon&#x27;s young adult fiction novel &quot;The Time That Never Was&quot; (ISBN 978-1-910022-61-0), the first in THE SWIDGERS book series, was published by Luath Press. &quot;Destination Time Travel&quot; (ISBN 978-1-80425-101-0), co-written with Dick Fiddy, archivist at the British Film Institute, was published in 2023 by Luath Press. &quot;Destination Time Travel&quot; is a look at the story tropes of time travel tales, exploring time travel plots, story devices, time paradoxes, causal loops, time guardians and time windows. The book was published to coincide with the Destination Time Travel season at the British Film Institute in October and November 2023. 

Nallon has written and performed in three one-man shows. In 2002 Nallon wrote and appeared in &quot;The Big Odyssey&quot;, a theatrical adaptation of Homer&#x27;s Odyssey, which was staged at the Assembly Rooms as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The show had a nationwide tour in 2003. Also in 2003 Nallon wrote &quot;Steve Nallon&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, a theatrical adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; which he performed the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and in 2004 Nallon wrote and starred in &quot;Steve Nallon&#x27;s Adventure&#x27;s in Wonderland&quot;, a theatrical adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s famous books. This show was staged at fringe festivals in Buxton and Edinburgh.

Nallon played Ada/Roy in a 2013 national tour of &quot;Cissie and Ada: An Hysterical Rectomy&quot;, a stage show based upon the characters played by Les Dawson and Roy Barraclough. The show is also a character study of Dawson.

In 2014, Nallon appeared as Dame Trott in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at the Buxton Opera House.

In 2015 Nallon voiced various characters in the pantomime section of &quot;Clementine&#x27;s Seasonal Spectacular,&quot; a puppet show which combined live puppets and video projection, which was staged at the Rosemary Branch theatre in Islington. These included an impersonation of Beryl Reid as the Fairy Godmother and Peter Lorre as Coldfinger, a parody of the 007 villain.

<text>John Richard Hersey (June 17, 1914 – March 24, 1993) was an American writer and journalist. He is considered one of the earliest practitioners of the so-called New Journalism, in which storytelling techniques of fiction are adapted to non-fiction reportage. In 1999, &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, Hersey&#x27;s account of the aftermath of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, was adjudged the finest work of American journalism of the 20th century by a 36-member panel associated with New York University&#x27;s journalism department.

== Background ==
Hersey was born in Tianjin, China, the son of Grace Baird and Roscoe Hersey, Protestant missionaries for the YMCA in Tianjin. Hersey learned to speak Chinese before he spoke English. Later he based his novel, &quot;The Call&quot; (1985), on the lives of his parents and several other missionaries of their generation.

John Hersey was a descendant of William Hersey (or Hercy, as the family name was then spelled) of Reading, Berkshire, England. William Hersey was one of the first settlers of Hingham, Massachusetts in 1635.

Hersey returned to the United States with his family when he was ten years old. He attended public school in Briarcliff Manor, New York, including Briarcliff High School for two years. At Briarcliff, he became his troop&#x27;s first Eagle Scout. Later he attended the Hotchkiss School. He studied at Yale University, where he worked for the Yale Daily News and was a member of the Skull and Bones Society along with classmates Brendan Gill and Richard A. Moore.

Hersey lettered in football at Yale, where he was coached by Ducky Pond, Greasy Neale, and Gerald Ford. He was a teammate of Larry Kelley and Clint Frank, Yale&#x27;s two Heisman Trophy winners. He subsequently was selected as a Mellon Fellow for graduate study at Clare College, Cambridge.

==Career==

After his time at Cambridge, Hersey got a summer job as private secretary and driver for author Sinclair Lewis during 1937. He chafed at those duties, and that autumn he began work for &quot;Time&quot;, for which he was hired after writing an essay on the magazine&#x27;s dismal quality. Two years later (1939) he was transferred to &quot;Time&quot; Chongqing bureau. In 1940, William Saroyan lists him among &quot;contributing editors&quot; at &quot;Time&quot; in the play &quot;Love&#x27;s Old Sweet Song&quot;.

During World War II, &quot;Newsweekly&quot; correspondent Hersey covered the fighting in Europe and Asia. He wrote articles for &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines. He accompanied Allied troops on their invasion of Sicily, survived four airplane crashes, and was commended by the Secretary of the Navy for his role in helping evacuate wounded soldiers from Guadalcanal. Before writing &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, Hersey published his novel &quot;Of Men and War&quot;, an account of war stories seen through the eyes of soldiers rather than a war correspondent. One of the stories in Hersey&#x27;s novel was inspired by future President John F. Kennedy, who also happened to be a former paramour of Hersey&#x27;s wife Frances Ann. During the Solomon Islands campaign, Kennedy commanded a PT-109 that was cut in half by a Japanese destroyer. He led the rescue of his crew, personally towing the injured to safety.

After the war, during the winter of 1945–46, Hersey was in Japan, reporting for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on the reconstruction of the devastated country, when he found a document written by a Jesuit missionary who had survived the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The journalist visited the missionary, who introduced him to other survivors.

=== Reporting from Hiroshima ===

Soon afterward John Hersey began discussions with William Shawn, an editor for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, about a lengthy piece on the previous summer&#x27;s bombing. Hersey proposed a story that would convey the cataclysmic narrative through individuals who survived.

In May 1946, Hersey traveled to Japan, where he spent three weeks doing research and interviewing survivors. He returned to America during late June and began writing the stories of six Hiroshima survivors: a German Jesuit priest, a widowed seamstress, two doctors, a minister, and a young woman who worked in a factory.

The resulting piece was his most notable work, the 31,000-word article &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, which was published in the August 31, 1946, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The story dealt with the atomic bomb dropped on that Japanese city on August 6, 1945, and its effects on the six survivors. The article occupied almost the entire issue of the magazine – something &quot;The New Yorker&quot; had never done before.

=== Later books and college master&#x27;s job ===
Hersey often decried the New Journalism, although he had helped create it. He would probably have disagreed that his &quot;Hiroshima&quot; article should be described as New Journalism. Later, the ascetic Hersey came to feel that some elements of the New Journalism of the 1970s were not rigorous enough about fact and reporting. After publication of &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, Hersey noted that &quot;the important &#x27;flashes&#x27; and &#x27;bulletins&#x27; are already forgotten by the time yesterday morning&#x27;s paper is used to line the trash can. The things we remember are emotions and impressions and illusions and images and characters: the elements of fiction.&quot;

Soon after writing &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, the former war correspondent began publishing mostly fiction. Hersey&#x27;s war novel &quot;The Wall&quot; (1950) was presented as a rediscovered journal recording the genesis and destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto, the largest of the Jewish ghettos established by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. The book became a bestseller. It also won the National Jewish Book Award in 1950, the second year after the award was established; and won the Sidney Hillman Foundation Journalism Award.

In 1950, during the Red Scare, Hersey was investigated by the FBI for possible Communist sympathies related to his past speeches and financial contributions, for example to the American Civil Liberties Union. The activities of his brother and other reporters were also investigated.

His article &quot;Why Do Students Bog Down on First R? A Local Committee Sheds Light on a National Problem: Reading&quot; (1954), about the dullness of grammar school readers in an issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, inspired Dr. Seuss&#x27;s children&#x27;s story &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. He also criticized the school system in his novel &quot;The Child Buyer&quot; (1960), a speculative fiction.

Hersey&#x27;s first novel &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot;, about the Allied occupation of a Sicilian town during World War II, won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1945. It was adapted that year as a movie of the same name, &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot;, directed by Henry King, and featuring John Hodiak and Gene Tierney. His 1956 short novel, &quot;A Single Pebble&quot;, recounts the journey of a young American engineer traveling up the Yangtze on a river junk during the 1920s. He learns that his romantic concepts of China brings disaster. In the novel &quot;White Lotus&quot; (1965), Hersey explores the African-American experience prior to civil rights, as reflected in an alternate history in which white Americans are enslaved by the Chinese after losing &quot;the Great War&quot; to them.

Hersey wrote &quot;The Algiers Motel Incident&quot; (1968), a non-fiction work about a racially motivated shooting of three young African-American men by police during the 12th Street Riot in Detroit, Michigan, in July 1967.

From 1965 to 1970, Hersey was master of Pierson College, one of twelve residential colleges at Yale University. His outspoken activism and early opposition to the Vietnam War made him controversial with alumni but admired by many students. After the trial of the Black Panthers in New Haven, Connecticut, Hersey wrote &quot;Letter to the Alumni&quot; (1970). He sympathetically addressed civil rights and anti-war activism – and attempted to explain them to sometimes aggravated alumni.

Hersey also pursued an unusual sideline: he operated the college&#x27;s small letterpress printing operation, which he sometimes used to publish broadsides. During 1969 he printed an elaborate broadside of an Edmund Burke quote for Elting E. Morison, a Yale history professor and fellow residential college master.

For 18 years Hersey taught two writing courses, in fiction and non-fiction, to Yale undergraduates. Hersey taught his last class in fiction writing at Yale during 1984. In his individual sessions with undergraduates to discuss their work, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author was sometimes known to write his comments in the margin. After discussing his suggestion with the student, he would take out his pencil and erase the comment. As Master of Pierson College, he hosted his old boss Henry Luce – with whom Hersey had become reconciled after their dispute years prior – when Luce spoke to the college&#x27;s undergraduates. &quot;Time&quot; founder Luce was a notoriously dull public speaker, and his address to the Pierson undergraduates was no exception. Afterward Luce privately revealed to Hersey for the first time that he and his wife Clare Boothe Luce had taken LSD while supervised by a physician. Hersey later said that he was relieved that Luce had saved that particular revelation for a more private audience.

In 1969 Hersey donated the services of his bulldog &#x27;Oliver&#x27; as mascot for the Yale football team, but he was concerned about his dog&#x27;s interest level as Handsome Dan XI (the Yale bulldog&#x27;s traditional name). Hersey wondered aloud &quot;whether Oliver would stay awake for two hours.&quot; That year, with the new mascot, the Yale team finished the season with a 7–2 record.

During 1985 John Hersey returned to Hiroshima, where he reported and wrote &quot;Hiroshima: The Aftermath&quot;, a follow-up to his original account. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published Hersey&#x27;s update in its July 15, 1985 issue. The article was subsequently appended to a newly revised edition of the book. &quot;What has kept the world safe from the bomb since 1945 has not been deterrence, in the sense of fear of specific weapons, so much as it&#x27;s been memory&quot;, wrote Hersey. &quot;The memory of what happened at Hiroshima&quot;.

Anne Fadiman described Hersey as a &quot;compulsive plagiarist&quot;. For instance, she said he used complete paragraphs from the James Agee biography by Laurence Bergreen in his own &quot;New Yorker&quot; essay about Agee. She said that half of his book, &quot;Men on Bataan&quot;, came from work her mother, Annalee Jacoby, and her then husband, Melville Jacoby, filed for &quot;Time&quot; .

== Death ==
A longtime resident of Vineyard Haven, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts – chronicled in his 1987 work &quot;Blues&quot; – John Hersey died at his winter home in Key West, Florida, on March 24, 1993, at the compound he and his wife shared with his friend, writer Ralph Ellison. Ellison&#x27;s novel &quot;Invisible Man&quot; was one of Hersey&#x27;s favorite works, and he often urged students in his fiction-writing seminar to study Ellison&#x27;s storytelling techniques and descriptive prose. Hersey&#x27;s death was front-page news in the next day&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot;. The writer was buried near his home on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. He was survived by his second wife, Barbara Jean Day (the former wife of Hersey&#x27;s colleague at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, artist Charles Addams), Hersey&#x27;s five children, one of whom is the composer and musician Baird Hersey, and six grandchildren. Barbara Hersey died on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard 14 years later on August 16, 2007.

==Honors==
On October 5, 2007, the United States Postal Service announced that it would honor five journalists of the 20th century with first-class rate postage stamps, to be issued on Tuesday, April 22, 2008: Martha Gellhorn, John Hersey, George Polk, Rubén Salazar, and Eric Sevareid. Postmaster General Jack Potter announced the stamp series at the Associated Press managing editors meeting in Washington, D.C.

In 1968, John Hersey High School in Arlington Heights, Illinois was named in his honor.

Soon before Hersey&#x27;s death, then Acting President of Yale Howard Lamar decided the university should honor its long-serving alumnus. The result was the annual John Hersey Lecture, the first of which was delivered March 22, 1993, by historian and Yale graduate David McCullough, who noted Hersey&#x27;s contributions to Yale but reserved his strongest praise for the former magazine writer&#x27;s prose. Hersey had &quot;portrayed our time&quot;, McCullough observed, &quot;with a breadth and artistry matched by very few. He has given us the century in a great shelf of brilliant work, and we are all his beneficiaries.&quot;

The John Hersey Prize at Yale was endowed during 1985 by students of the author and former Pierson College master. The prize is awarded to &quot;a senior or junior for a body of journalistic work reflecting the spirit and ideals of John Hersey: engagement with moral and social issues, responsible reportage and consciousness of craftsmanship.&quot; Winners of the John Hersey Prize include David M. Halbfinger (Yale Class of 1990) and Motoko Rich (Class of 1991), who both later had reporting careers for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and journalist Jacob Weisberg (Class of 1985), who would become editor-in-chief of The Slate Group. Among Hersey&#x27;s earlier students at Yale was Michiko Kakutani, formerly the chief book critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as well as film critic Gene Siskel.

During his lifetime, Hersey served in many jobs associated with writing, journalism and education. He was the first non-academic named master of a Yale residential college. He was past president of the Authors League of America, and he was elected chancellor by the membership of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Hersey was an honorary fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. He was awarded honorary degrees by Yale University, the New School for Social Research, Syracuse University, Washington and Jefferson College, Wesleyan University, The College of William and Mary and others.

<doc id="212466" wikidata="Q348613" url="?curid=212466" title="Arthur Penrhyn Stanley">
<text>Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, (13 December 1815 – 18 July 1881) known as Dean Stanley, was an English Anglican priest and ecclesiastical historian. He was Dean of Westminster from 1864 to 1881. His position was that of a Broad Churchman and he was the author of a number of works on Church History. He was a co-founder of the Palestine Exploration Fund.

== Early life ==
Stanley was born in Alderley Edge, in Cheshire, where his father, Edward Stanley, later Bishop of Norwich, was then rector. A brother was Owen Stanley, and his sister was Mary Stanley. The middle-name &#x27;Penrhyn&#x27; suggests Welsh lineage.

He was educated at Rugby School under Thomas Arnold and in 1834 went up to Balliol College, Oxford. He is generally considered to be the source for the character of George Arthur in Thomas Hughes&#x27;s well-known book &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;, which is based on Rugby. After winning the Ireland scholarship and the Newdigate Prize for an English poem (&quot;The Gypsies&quot;), he was in 1839 elected a Fellow of University College and the same year took holy orders. In 1840 he travelled in Greece and Italy and on his return settled at Oxford, where for ten years, he was tutor of his college and an influential element in university life. His relationship with his pupils was close and affectionate, and the charm of his character won him friends on all sides. His literary reputation was early established by his &quot;Life of Arnold&quot;, published in 1844. In 1845 he was appointed select preacher, and published in 1847 a volume of &quot;Sermons and Essays on the Apostolic Age&quot;, which not only laid the foundation of his fame as a preacher but also marked his future position as a theologian. In university politics, which at the time wore mainly the form of theological controversy, he was a strong advocate of comprehension and toleration.

== Controversies ==
As an undergraduate, he had sympathised with Arnold in resenting the agitation led by the High Church Party in 1836 against the appointment of R. D. Hampden to the Regius professorship of divinity. During the long controversy that followed the publication in 1841 of &quot;Tract 90&quot; and ended in the withdrawal of John Henry Newman from the Church of England, he used all his influence to protect from formal condemnation the leaders and tenets of the &quot;Tractarian&quot; party.

In 1847, he resisted the movement set on foot at Oxford against Hampden&#x27;s appointment to the bishopric of Hereford. Finally, in 1850, in an article published in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; in defence of the Gorham judgment, he asserted two principles that he maintained to the end of his life: first, &quot;that the so-called supremacy of the Crown in religious matters was in reality nothing else than the supremacy of law, and, secondly, that the Church of England, by the very condition of its being, was not High or Low, but Broad, and had always included and been meant to include, opposite and contradictory opinions on points even more important than those at present under discussion&quot;.

== University reform ==

It was not only in theoretical but also in academic matters that his sympathies were on the liberal side. He was greatly interested in university reform and acted as secretary to the royal commission appointed in 1850. Of the important changes in administration and education which were ultimately carried out, Stanley, who took the principal share in drafting the report printed in 1852, was a strenuous advocate. The changes included the transference of the initiative in university legislation from the sole authority of the heads of houses to an elected and representative body, the opening of college fellowships and scholarships to competition by the removal of local and other restrictions, the non-enforcement at matriculation of subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles and various steps for increasing the usefulness and influence of the professorship. Before the report was issued, Stanley was appointed to a canonry in Canterbury Cathedral. During his residence there, he published his &quot;Memoir&quot; of his father (1851), and completed his &quot;Commentary on the Epistles to the Corinthians&quot; (1855). In the winter and the spring of 1852–1853, he made a tour in Egypt and the Holy Land, the result of which was his well-known volume on Sinai and Palestine (1856). In 1857, he travelled in Russia and collected much of the materials for his Lectures on the Eastern Orthodox Church (1861). The book of the lectures, &quot;History of the Eastern Church&quot;, contained an argument for the apostolic claims of the Church of Abyssinia. His &quot;Memorials of Canterbury&quot; (1855), displayed the full maturity of his power of dealing with historical events and characters. He was also examining chaplain to Bishop A. C. Tait, his former tutor.

== Chair of ecclesiastical history ==
At the close of 1856 Stanley was appointed Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Oxford, a post that, with the attached canonry at Christ Church, he held until 1863. He began his treatment of the subject with &quot;the first dawn of the history of the church&quot;, the call of Abraham, and published the first two volumes of his &quot;History of the Jewish Church&quot; in 1863 and 1865. From 1860 to 1864 academic and clerical circles were agitated by the storm which followed the publication of &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;, a volume to which two of his most valued friends, Benjamin Jowett and Frederick Temple, had been contributors. Stanley&#x27;s part in this controversy may be studied in the second and third of his &quot;Essays on Church and State&quot; (1870). The result of his action was to alienate the leaders of the High Church party, who had endeavoured to procure the formal condemnation of the views advanced in &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;. In 1863, he published a &quot;Letter to the Bishop of London&quot;, advocating a relaxation of the terms of clerical subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles and the Book of Common Prayer. An act amending the Act of Uniformity and carrying out in some degree Stanley&#x27;s proposals was passed in the year 1865. In 1862, Stanley, at Queen Victoria&#x27;s wish, accompanied the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) on a tour in Egypt and Palestine. The following year, the Queen appointed him Deputy Clerk of the Closet.

In June 1863, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society as &quot;The Author of – Life of Doctor Arnold – Historical Memorials of Canterbury – Syria and Palestine in connexion with their History – Lectures on the Eastern Churches – and Lectures on the Jewish Churches&quot; The collected Works of Dean Stanley take up 32 bound volumes.

== Dean of Westminster ==

Stanley was a candidate to succeed as Archbishop of Dublin following the death of Richard Whately in October 1863, but was rejected by the Church of Ireland. Richard Chenevix Trench, the Dean of Westminster, was appointed instead, and towards the close of 1863, Stanley was appointed by the Crown to the newly-vacated deanery. In December, he married Lady Augusta Bruce, sister of Lord Elgin, then governor-general of India. His tenure of the deanery of Westminster was memorable in many ways. He recognised from the first two important disqualifications: his indifference to music and his slight knowledge of architecture. On both subjects, he availed himself, largely of the aid of others, and threw himself with characteristic energy and entire success into the task of rescuing from neglect and preserving from decay the treasure of historic monuments in which Westminster Abbey is so rich. In 1865, he published his &quot;Memorials of Westminster Abbey&quot;, a work which, despite occasional inaccuracies, is a mine of information. He was a constant preacher and gave a great impulse to Trench&#x27;s practice of inviting distinguished preachers to the abbey pulpit, especially to the evening services in the nave. His personal influence, already unique, was much increased by his removal to London. His circle of friends included men of every denomination, every class and almost of every nation.

== Literary work ==
He was untiring in literary work, and though that consisted very largely of occasional papers, lectures, articles in reviews, addresses, and sermons, it included a third volume of his &quot;History of the Jewish Church&quot;, a volume on the &quot;Church of Scotland&quot;, another of &quot;Addresses and Sermons preached in America&quot;, &quot;Essays Chiefly on Questions of Church and State from 1850 to 1870 (1870) and &quot;Christian Institutions : Essays on Ecclesiastical Subjects&quot; (1881), the last two collections some would consider still very relevant today. He was continually engaged in theological controversy, although courteously, and, by his advocacy of all efforts to promote the social, moral and religious amelioration of the poorer classes and his chivalrous courage in defending those whom he held to be unjustly denounced, undoubtedly incurred opposition from some in influential circles. Among the causes of offence might be enumerated not only his vigorous defence of one from whom he differed to some extent, Bishop Colenso, but his invitation to the Holy Communion of all the revisers of the translation of the Bible, including a Unitarian among other Nonconformists. Still stronger was the feeling caused by his efforts to make the recital of the Athanasian Creed optional instead of imperative in the Church of England. In 1874 he spent part of the winter in Russia, where he went to take part in the marriage of Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and the Grand Duchess Marie.

== Final years ==
Stanley lost his wife in the spring of 1876, a blow from which he never entirely recovered. In 1878, he became interested by a tour in America and in the following autumn visited for the last time northern Italy and Venice. In the spring of 1881 he preached funeral sermons in the abbey on Thomas Carlyle and Benjamin Disraeli and concluded with the latter a series of sermons preached on public occasions. In the summer, he was preparing a paper on the Westminster Confession and preaching in the abbey a course of Saturday Lectures on the Beatitudes. He died in the Deanery on 18 July 1881.

He was buried in Henry VII&#x27;s chapel in the same grave as his wife. His pallbearers comprised representatives of literature, of science, of both Houses of Parliament, of theology, Anglican and Nonconformist, and of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The recumbent monument, by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm placed upon the spot, and the windows (destroyed 1939–45) in the chapter-house of the abbey, one of them a gift from Queen Victoria, were a tribute to his memory from friends of every class in England and America.

A description of his funeral service, on 25 July, is given in a footnote to &quot;Historical memorials of Westminster Abbey&quot;: &quot;Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (author of this volume) ... was followed by the Prince of Wales, as representative of the Sovereign, by other members of the Royal Family, by representatives of the three Estates of the Realm, of the Cabinet Ministers, the literature, arts, science, and religion of the country, and by a large concourse of the working-men of Westminster—the majority mourning for one who had been their personal friend. The coffin was covered with memorials and expressions of regret from high and low in England, Scotland, France, Germany, and America, and from the members of the Armenian Church. He rests in the same grave with his beloved wife, in the Abbey which he loved so dearly, which he cherished as &#x27;the likeness of the whole English Constitution,&#x27; for the care and illustration of which he laboured unceasingly, and with which his name will always be associated.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Stanley was the leading liberal theologian of his time in England. His writings reveal his special views, aims and aspirations. He regarded the age in which he lived as a period of transition, to be followed either by an &quot;eclipse of faith&quot; or by a &quot;revival of Christianity in a wider aspect,&quot; a &quot;catholic, comprehensive, all-embracing Christianity&quot; that &quot;might yet overcome the world&quot;. He believed that the Christian Church had not yet presented &quot;its final or its most perfect aspect to the world&quot;; that &quot;the belief of each successive age of Christendom had as a matter of fact varied enormously from the belief of its predecessor&quot;; that &quot;all confessions and similar documents are, if taken as final expressions of absolute truth, misleading&quot;; and that &quot;there still remained, behind all the controversies of the past, a higher Christianity which neither assailants nor defenders had fully exhausted.&quot; &quot;The first duty of a modern theologian&quot; he held to be &quot;to study the Bible, not for the sake of making or defending systems out of it, but for the sake of discovering what it actually contains.&quot; To this study he looked for the best hope of such a progressive development of Christian theology as should avert the danger arising from &quot;the apparently increasing divergence between the intelligence and the faith of our time.&quot; He enforced the duty &quot;of placing in the background whatever was accidental, temporary or secondary, and of bringing into due prominence what was primary and essential.&quot; In the former group Stanley would have placed all questions connected with Episcopal or Presbyterian orders, or that deal only with the outward forms or ceremonies of religion, or with the authorship or age of the books of the Old Testament.

The foremost and highest place, that of the &quot;essential and supernatural&quot; elements of religion, he reserved for its moral and spiritual truths, &quot;its chief evidence and chief essence,&quot; &quot;the truths to be drawn from the teaching and from the life of Christ,&quot; in whose character he did not hesitate to recognise &quot;the greatest of all miracles.&quot;

He insisted on the essential points of union between various denominations of Christians. He was an advocate of the connection between Church and State. By this he understood: (1) &quot;the recognition and support on the part of the state of the religious expression of the faith of the community,&quot; and (2) &quot;that this religious expression of the faith of the community on the most sacred and most vital of all its interests should be controlled and guided by the whole community through the supremacy of law.&quot; At the same time he was in favour of making the creed of the Church as wide as possible—&quot;not narrower than that which is even now the test of its membership, the Apostles&#x27; Creed&quot;—and of throwing down all barriers which could be wisely dispensed with to admission to its ministry. As an immediate step he even advocated the admission under due restrictions of English Nonconformists and Scottish Presbyterians, to preach in Anglican pulpits.

The subjects to which he looked as, the most essential of all—the universality of the divine love, the supreme importance of the moral and spiritual elements of religion, the supremacy of conscience, the sense of the central citadel of Christianity as being contained in the character, the history, the spirit of its divine Founder—have impressed themselves more and more on the teaching and the preaching in the Church.

According to William Archer, Dean Stanley was &quot;incapable of distinguishing one tune from another&quot; and &quot;took off his hat when the band played &#x27;Rule, Britannia,&#x27; under the impression that it was &#x27;God Save the Queen.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="212467" wikidata="Q2469208" url="?curid=212467" title="Grand Grimoire">
<text>The Grand Grimoire, also known as Le Dragon Rouge or The Red Dragon, is a black magic goetic grimoire. Different editions date the book to 1521, 1522 or 1421. Owen Davies suggests 1702 is when the first edition may have been created and a &quot;Bibliothèque bleue&quot; version (a popular edition, similar to a chapbook) of the text may have been published in 1750. The 19th-century French occultist Éliphas Lévi considered the contemporary edition of &quot;Le Dragon Rouge&quot; to be a counterfeit of a true, older Grand Grimoire.

The &quot;introductory chapter&quot; was written by Antonio Venitiana del Rabina, who said he had gathered his information from original writings of King Solomon. Much of the material of this grimoire derives from the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; and the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, pseudepigraphical grimoires attributed to King Solomon. The first book contains instructions for summoning Lucifer or Lucifuge Rofocale, for the purpose of forming a deal with the Devil.

==Contents==
The work is divided into two books. The first book contains instructions for summoning a demon and for the construction of tools with which to force the demon to do one&#x27;s bidding. The second book is divided further into two parts: the &quot;Sanctum Regnum&quot; (&quot;Holy Kingdom&quot;) and &quot;Secrets, de L&#x27;Art Magique du Grand Grimoire&quot; (&quot;Secrets, of the magic art of the Grand Grimoire&quot;). The &quot;Sanctum Regnum&quot; contain instructions for making a pact with the demon, allowing one to command the spirit without the tools required by book one, but at greater risk. &quot;Secrets&quot; contains simple spells and rituals one can employ after having performed the ritual of the first book. Some editions contain a short text between these two parts, &quot;Le Secret Magique, où le Grand Art de pouvoir parler aux Morts&quot; (&quot;The Magic Secret, or the Grand Art of being able to speak with the dead&quot;), dealing with necromancy.

The book describes several demons as well as the rituals to summon them in order to make a pact with them. It also details several spells for winning a lottery, talking to spirits, being loved by a girl, making oneself invisible, etc.

===List of demons===
This book mentions three greater demons. These demons are similarly prioritized in &quot;Grimorium Verum&quot;.

* Lucifer, emperor
* Beelzebub, prince
* Astaroth, grand duke

It also mentions six lesser demons:
* Lucifuge Rofocale, prime minister
* Satanachia, commander in chief (in French, &quot;commandant en chef&quot;)
* Agaliarept, commandant 
* Fleurèty, lieutenant-general
* Sargatanas, brigadier-major
* Nebiros, marshal and inspector general

==In popular culture==
The 2007 novel &quot;God&#x27;s Demon&quot; by Wayne Barlowe features most of the Grand Grimoire&#x27;s named demons as characters, including Sargatanas as its protagonist.

In its 2014-15 second season, the Fox TV series &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; presents the &quot;Grand Grimoire&quot; as once owned by occultist John Dee and coveted by an evil warlock named Solomon Kent. It became possessed by one of the series&#x27; antagonists, Henry Parrish, and helped cause the demise of protagonist Katrina Crane.

The killer of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman in Kingsbury, London in 2020, had invoked Lucifuge Rofocale prior to the killings. He hoped that by sacrificing their lives to the demon, he would win a lottery.

<doc id="212468" wikidata="Q7181575" url="?curid=212468" title="Phi Theta Kappa">
<text>Phi Theta Kappa ( or PTK) is an honor society for students of associate degree-granting colleges. Its headquarters are in Jackson, Mississippi and it has more than 4.3 million members in nearly 1,300 chapters in eleven nations.

== History ==
Phi Theta Kappa originated from Kappa Phi Omicron, an honor society established at Stephens College in Missouri, a two-year college for women. As similar honor societies formed in Missouri, the college presidents and students of eight Missouri women&#x27;s colleges came together in 1918 to create a single honor society—Phi Theta Kappa.

Phi Theta Kappa&#x27;s mission is to recognize community college students&#x27; academic achievement and to provide opportunities for them to grow as scholars and leaders. Phi Theta Kappa was named after Phi Beta Kappa and modeled after many aspects of the senior college honor society. Its first chapter was chartered at St. Joseph Junior College in Missouri, in 1926. 

On November 19, 1929, Phi Theta Kappa petitioned the American Association of Junior Colleges (now the American Association of Community Colleges) to be recognized as an official national honor society for junior colleges, alongside Phi Rho Pi and others. While not historically accurate, Phi Theta Kappa now celebrates its &quot;Founder&#x27;s Day&quot; on November 19 each year.

In 1930, Margaret Mosal was elected as the first National President of Phi Theta Kappa. Mosal oversaw the operations of Phi Theta Kappa from a makeshift office in the back of her husband&#x27;s hardware store, where she notably stored all of the organization&#x27;s records in a shoebox. In 1953, she moved the operations of Phi Theta Kappa to her home, underscoring the meager beginnings in the first fifty years of the society

The society&#x27;s second national president, Rod Risley, first joined Phi Theta Kappa as a student, becoming national president in 1974, and subsequently joined as an employee in 1977. His career culminated in over three decades as executive director and CEO, during which he was recognized in the AACC Hall of Fame in 2008. 

Today, the society&#x27;s headquarters are in Jackson, Mississippi. It has initiated more than 4.3 million members.

== Symbols ==

Phi Theta Kappa acknowledges that it copied its name after Phi Beta Kappa, and it was modeled after many aspects of the senior college honor society. The society adopted blue and gold, the golden key insignia, and modeled the name directly after Phi Beta Kappa. While similar in name, color scheme, and symbols, it is important to note that no formal relationship between the two societies has ever existed.

Members are referred to as &quot;Phi Theta Kappans.&quot; The first membership pin was designed in 1921: a blue triangle containing three Greek letters surrounded by pearls. The distinctive gold key membership pin was adopted in 1930 and features a black enamel band upon which the three Greek letters appear. Behind the band is a wreath composed of oak leaves on one side, denoting stability and strength of character, and laurel on the other side, signifying achievement and success. Above the band is a representation of the head of Athena, Goddess of Wisdom; in the base appear the mystic Greek letters meaning light, the light of learning, and knowledge. The colors of the society are blue for scholarship and gold for purity. Its hallmarks or pillars are &quot;Scholarship, Leadership, Service, Fellowship&quot;.

== Activities ==
Phi Theta Kappa offers transfer scholarships for its members and scholarships to help members complete associate, bachelor&#x27;s, and master&#x27;s degrees and to help workforce-bound member pay for certification costs. The society publishes the literary journal &quot;Nota Bene, Civic Scholar: Phi Theta Kappa Journal of Undergraduate Research,&quot; and &quot;Change Makers: Phi Theta Kappa Journal of Student Leadership.&quot; PTK also offers an online program to help students develop job skills. 

== Membership ==
Membership in Phi Theta Kappa is by invitation. Students must complete twelve hours of coursework toward an associate degree, six hours toward a one-year certificate, or twelve hours toward a bachelor&#x27;s degree and have a minimum 3.5 grade point average (GPA) according to the society bylaws. Members are required to pay an initial membership fee.

== Chapters ==
Phi Theta Kappa has nearly 1,300 chapters in eleven nations.

== Notable members ==
== Controversies and member misconduct ==
In 2024, Phi Theta Kappa entered into two lawsuits over false advertising, attempted monopoly, and trade dress. Honor Society sued PTK, claiming it misrepresents its membership criteria and potentially deceives students into joining under false pretenses, by falsely asserting that it is limited to the top ten percent of students. PTK filed a lawsuit against the Honor Society, alleging trademark infringement and the use of similar visual elements and marketing materials, namely blue and gold colors, gold stoles, and the usage of wreaths. 

In February 2024, Robin Lowe, a former advisor for the PTK chapter at Itawamba Community College, was charged with embezzlement of public funds meant to benefit the PTK chapter. Lowe was the chapter advisor for Phi Theta Kappa for fifteen years, from 2008 to May of 2023.

In 2015, national PTK president Rod Risley took a paid leave of absence following claims of sexual harassment, intimidation, and unprofessional behavior from two former student international officers. These allegations prompted the Phi Theta Kappa board of directors to initiate an investigation. Risley announced his retirement, leading to the termination of the inquiry and his receipt of a multi-million dollar retirement package.

<text>Just William is the first book of children&#x27;s short stories about the young school boy William Brown, written by Richmal Crompton, and published in 1922. The book was the first in the series of William Brown books which was the basis for numerous television series, films and radio adaptations. &quot;Just William&quot; is also sometimes used as a title for the series of books as a whole, and is also the name of various television, film and radio adaptations of the books. The William stories first appeared in &quot;Home&quot; magazine and &quot;Happy Mag&quot;.

==Short stories==
The book contains the following short stories:
* William Goes to the Pictures – William&#x27;s aunt gives him a shilling, so he buys sweets and goes to the cinema. On his way home he is obsessed with acting out what he has seen. 
* William the Intruder – William steals the attentions of his brother&#x27;s new crush.
* William Below Stairs – William runs away from home after reading a book about a boy who ran away and made a fortune in gold. He gets a job working as a servant in an upper-class household. 
* The Fall of the Idol – William has a crush on his teacher Miss Drew, but eventually discovers she has &quot;feet of clay&quot;.
* The Show – William and his friends, who call themselves The Outlaws, put on an animal show in William&#x27;s room for money and finally decide to use his sleeping Aunt Emily as an exhibit.
* A Question of Grammar – William&#x27;s wilful misunderstanding of a double negative leads him to throw a wild party in his parents&#x27; absence.
* William Joins the Band of Hope – William is forced to join the Temperance movement along with the other Outlaws, but manages to turn the first meeting into a punch-up.
* The Outlaws – The first-ever William story. William is forced to spend his precious half-holiday looking after a baby but decides to kidnap him and bring him to the Outlaws.
* William and White Satin – When William is forced to be a page at his cousin&#x27;s wedding, he becomes a figure of ridicule. However, he soon finds an ally in an equally reluctant bridesmaid, his cousin.
* William&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day – William is encouraged to make a New Year&#x27;s resolution by the sweet shop owner Mr Moss. He decides to be polite for New Years Day and ends up looking after the Sweet Shop.
* The Best Laid Plans – A young man misguidedly enlists William&#x27;s help in wooing his sister Ethel.
* &quot;Jumble&quot; – The story of how William met his dog Jumble.

The 2022 &quot;100th anniversary edition&quot; removes &quot;William the Intruder&quot;, largely due to William&#x27;s &quot;Red Indian&quot; (an offensive portrayal of a Native American hunter) persona he adopts over the course of the story. In addition to this, the order of the remaining stories has been changed.

==Characters==
William Brown is an eleven-year-old boy, eternally scruffy and frowning. William and his friends, Ginger, Henry, and Douglas, call themselves &quot;The Outlaws&quot;, and meet at the old barn in Farmer Jenks&#x27; field, with William being the leader of the gang. The Outlaws are sworn enemies of the Hubert Lane-ites, with whom they frequently clash.

Ginger is William&#x27;s faithful friend and almost as tousled, reckless and grimy as William himself. He has been known to take over in William&#x27;s absence and is his best friend. Henry brings an air of wisdom to the otherwise non-academic Outlaws. Never liking to own up to being at a loss, he can always deliver the knowledge that the Outlaws need. In the first book, it is revealed that he is the oldest of the Outlaws. Douglas, perhaps the most pessimistic of the Outlaws (though it has never stopped him joining in with any lawless activity), is the best of them at spelling. He spells knights &quot;gnights&quot; and knocks &quot;gnocks&quot;. The Outlaws take pride in this because, unlike them, he knows the contrariness of the English language.

William&#x27;s family – his elder, red-gold-haired sister Ethel and brother Robert, placid mother and stern father, and never-ending supply of elderly aunts – cannot understand William. Only his mother has any sympathy for him, though his father sometimes shows a side of himself that seems to admit he was once like William himself.

Other recurring characters include Violet Elizabeth Bott, lisping spoiled daughter of the local nouveau riche millionaire (whose companionship William reluctantly endures, to prevent her carrying out her threat &quot;I&#x27;ll thcream and thcream &#x27;till I&#x27;m thick&quot;), and Joan Clive, the dark-haired girl for whom William has a soft spot. Joan is sometimes considered a member of the Outlaws (the only girl entitled to this high privilege) and sometimes an &quot;Outlaw ally&quot;, because she took a special oath. At one point she went away to boarding school, but continued to appear in William&#x27;s adventures during her holidays.

William writes stories (&quot;The Tale of The Bloody Hand&quot;), although most of these are written in terrible grammar, to much comic effect. He likes to perform drama, and is fond of white rats, bull&#x27;s eyes, football, and cricket.

A notable feature of the stories is the subtle observance of the nature of leadership. William often has to reconcile his own ambitions with the needs of the individuals within the Outlaws. His strength of personality means that his leadership is never questioned. William rarely exercises his power over the Outlaws without conscience.

William has a few arch-enemies, Hubert Lane being the most sought after. Others include Hubert&#x27;s lieutenant Bertie Franks, and other confederates.

<text>Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez (born July 27, 1975), nicknamed &quot;A-Rod&quot;, is an American former professional baseball shortstop, third baseman and designated hitter and current businessman. Rodriguez played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners (1994–2000), Texas Rangers (2001–2003), and New York Yankees (2004–2013, 2015–2016). Rodriguez is the chairman and chief executive officer of A-Rod Corp as well as the chairman of Presidente beer. He is about to purchase a controlling interest in the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Minnesota Timberwolves with Marc Lore. Rodriguez began his professional baseball career as one of the sport&#x27;s most highly touted prospects, and is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time.

With a career .295 batting average, Rodriguez amassed over 600 home runs (696), over 2,000 runs batted in (RBI), over 2,000 runs scored, over 3,000 hits, and over 300 stolen bases, the only player in MLB history to achieve all of those feats. He was also a 14-time All-Star, winning three American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, 10 Silver Slugger Awards, and two Gold Glove Awards. Rodriguez is also the career record holder for grand slams. He twice broke the record for the largest sports contract ever signed. He also admitted using banned performance-enhancing drugs from 2001 to 2003 and was consequently suspended for the entire 2014 season. Rodriguez is ranked first in career wins above replacement for shortstops of the modern era (post–1901).

The Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 MLB draft, and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the age of 18. In 1996, he became the Mariners&#x27; starting shortstop, won the major league batting title, and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award. His combination of power, speed, and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise, but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers. The 10-year, $252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history at the time. He played at a high level in his three years with Texas, highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003, but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure. Before the 2004 season, Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees, for whom he converted to a third baseman to accommodate their shortstop Derek Jeter. He was named AL MVP in 2005 and 2007. He opted out of his contract after the 2007 season, then signed a new 10-year, $275 million deal with the Yankees, breaking his own record for the sport&#x27;s most lucrative contract. He became the youngest player to hit 500 home runs, reaching the milestone in 2007. He helped the Yankees win the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies, which was Rodriguez&#x27;s only championship title. Toward the end of his career, he was hampered by hip and knee injuries, which caused him to become exclusively a designated hitter. He played his final game in professional baseball on August 12, 2016.

Despite denying in a 2007 interview that he had ever used performance-enhancing drugs, Rodriguez admitted in 2009 to having used steroids, saying he used them from 2001 to 2003 when playing for the Rangers due to &quot;an enormous amount of pressure&quot; to perform. While recovering from a hip injury in 2013, Rodriguez made headlines by feuding with team management over his rehabilitation and for having allegedly obtained performance-enhancing drugs as part of the Biogenesis baseball scandal. In August 2013, MLB announced a 211-game suspension for Rodriguez for his involvement in the scandal. After an arbitration hearing, the suspension was reduced to 162 games, which kept him off the field for the entire 2014 season.

After retiring as a player, Rodriguez became a media personality, serving as a broadcaster for Fox Sports 1, a cast member of &quot;Shark Tank&quot; and a member of the ABC News network. In January 2018, ESPN announced that Rodriguez would be joining the broadcast team of &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot;. In January 2017, CNBC announced Rodriguez would be the host of the show &quot;Back In The Game&quot;, where he would help former athletes make a comeback in their personal lives; the first episode debuted on the network in March 2018.

==Early life==
Rodriguez was born in 1975 in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan to Dominican immigrants Víctor Manuel Rodríguez Marcano and Lourdes Nelly Navarro Melo from San Juan de la Maguana, Dominican Republic. He was raised alongside his two half-siblings, Joe and Suzy, from his mother&#x27;s first marriage. In 1979, when he was four years old, the family moved to the Dominican Republic, then to Miami, Florida, when he was in the fourth grade. His father played baseball for a team in the Dominican Republic and introduced him to the sport as a child. Growing up, Rodriguez&#x27;s favorite baseball players were Keith Hernandez, Dale Murphy, and Cal Ripken Jr., and his favorite team was the New York Mets.

At the end of his freshman year at Christopher Columbus High School in Miami, Rodriguez transferred to Westminster Christian School in Palmetto Bay, Florida, where he was a star shortstop on the baseball team and played quarterback on the football team. In 100 games he batted .419 with 90 stolen bases. Westminster won the high school national championship in his junior year. He was first team prep All-American as a senior, hitting .505 with nine home runs, 36 runs batted in (RBIs), and 35 stolen bases in 35 attempts in 33 games. He was selected as the USA Baseball Junior Player of the Year and as Gatorade&#x27;s national baseball student-athlete of the year. In 1993, Rodriguez became the first high school player to try out for the United States national baseball team. He was regarded as the top prospect in the country.

Rodriguez signed a letter of intent to play baseball for University of Miami and was also recruited by Miami to play quarterback for its football team. Rodriguez turned down the University of Miami baseball scholarship offer and never played college baseball, opting instead to sign with the Seattle Mariners after being selected first overall in the 1993 amateur draft at the age of 17.

==Professional career==

===Draft and minor leagues===
The Seattle Mariners selected Rodriguez with the first overall selection of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft. The Mariners signed him to a three-year contract worth $1.3 million, and a $1 million signing bonus.

===Seattle Mariners===
====1994–1995====
In 1994, Rodriguez made his professional baseball debut as a minor league player with the Appleton Foxes of the Class A Midwest League. He was promoted to the Jacksonville Suns of the Class AA Southern League. He played in 17 games for Jacksonville, then was promoted to Calgary for 32 games before moving up to the major leagues. On July 8, 1994, Rodriguez debuted in the major leagues as a starting shortstop, just the third 18-year-old major league shortstop since 1900. He was also the first 18-year-old major league player since 1978 and the youngest position player in Seattle history. He remains the last 18-year-old to play in an MLB game, as of the end of the 2024 season. Rodriguez recorded his first major league hit when he singled off of Sergio Valdez on July 9 at Fenway Park. Rodriguez played in 17 games for the Mariners, compiling a .204 batting average, two RBIs, and three stolen bases. In August, The Mariners optioned Rodriguez to the Calgary Cannons of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 32 games for Calgary, he had 37 hits in 119 at-bats for a .311 batting average. He also compiled six home runs and 21 RBIs.
Rodriguez split most of the 1995 season between the Mariners and the Tacoma Rainiers of the PCL. He hit his first major league home run off Kansas City&#x27;s Tom Gordon on June 12. Rodriguez permanently joined the Mariners roster in August and got his first taste of postseason play, albeit just two at-bats. Again, he was the youngest player in Major League Baseball. During the 1995 season, Rodriguez played 48 games for Seattle, batting .232 with five home runs, 19 RBI, and four stolen bases.

====1996–1997====
The following year, Rodriguez took over as the Mariners&#x27; regular shortstop and had his breakout season. He led the American League (AL) with a .358 batting average, the highest for an AL right-handed batter since Joe DiMaggio hit .381 in 1939 and the third-highest ever for a shortstop. He also had 36 home runs with 123 RBIs. At 21 years and one month, he was the 3rd youngest AL batting leader ever behind Al Kaline (20) in 1955 and Ty Cobb (20) in 1907, and the third-youngest player in history with 35+ homers. He was also the first major league shortstop to win a batting title since 1960, and the first in the AL since 1944. At age 20 years, 11 months, he was the youngest shortstop in All-Star Game history. He also led the AL in runs (141), total bases (379), and doubles (54) and ranked among the league leaders in base hits (second, 215), extra-base hits (second, 91), multi-hit games (third, 65), slugging (fourth, .631), RBI (eighth, 123), and on-base percentage (eighth, .414). Rodriguez posted the highest totals ever for a shortstop in runs, hits, doubles, extra-base hits, and slugging, and tied most total bases, and established Seattle club records for average, runs, hits, doubles, and total bases, in a season that statistical analysts consider the best ever by a shortstop.

The &quot;Sporting News&quot; and Associated Press selected Rodriguez as their Major League Player of the Year. He finished second to Juan González in balloting for the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He finished three points behind González (290–287), matching the second closest AL MVP voting in history.

In 1997, Rodriguez batted .300 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs. He hit for the cycle on June 5, becoming the second Mariner, and at 21 years, 10 months, the fifth-youngest player in history, to accomplish the feat. He was the fan&#x27;s choice to start the All-Star Game at shortstop for the AL team, becoming the first player other than Ripken to start at shortstop in 13 years. It was the first All-Star start of his career and his second All-Star Game in two years.

====1998–2000====
Rodriguez rebounded in 1998, when he set the AL record for homers by a shortstop and became just the third member of the 40–40 club, (with 42 home runs and 46 stolen bases) and one of just 3 shortstops in history to hit 40 home runs in a season. His 43.9 Power-speed number was, through at least 2008, the highest single season Power/Speed Number ever. He was selected as Players Choice AL Player of the Year, won his second Silver Slugger Award, and finished ninth in the MVP voting.

In 1999, Rodriguez had a .310 average, 42 home runs, and 111 RBIs, despite missing over 30 games with an injury and playing the second half of the season at Safeco Field, a considerably less hitter-friendly ballpark than the Kingdome. At the time, he was the youngest-ever player to record 100 home runs and 100 stolen bases, at 23 years and 309 days of age. In April 2015, Mike Trout reached the same milestone at 23 years and 253 days old.

Rodriguez entered 2000 as the cornerstone player of the Mariners franchise, which had recently traded superstars Randy Johnson and Ken Griffey Jr.. Rodriguez put up great numbers, hitting 41 home runs with 132 RBIs and a .316 batting average. He set a career high for walks (100) and became the only shortstop to have 100 runs, RBI, and walks in the same season. He hit well in the playoffs as well (.409 batting average and .773 slugging percentage), but Seattle lost to the New York Yankees in the 2000 American League Championship Series. He was selected as the Major League Player of the Year by &quot;Baseball America&quot; and finished third in the AL MVP voting.

===Texas Rangers===
Rodriguez became a free agent after the 2000 season. He eventually signed with the Texas Rangers, who had fallen to last place in their division in 2000. The contract was at the time the most lucrative contract in sports history: a 10-year deal worth $252 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The deal was worth $63 million more than the second-richest baseball deal. The contract was highly criticized, because it tied up valuable payroll space that could have been spent to improve other areas, such as pitching. Dave McNally, one of the players who had successfully challenged the reserve clause in the 1970s to create free agency in baseball, said, &quot;My first thought when I saw [reports that Rodriguez had signed] was: Did Texas offer him $250 million and he wanted two more? How did they get to $252 million?&quot;

In an interview eight years later, Rodriguez said he regretted signing with the Texas Rangers and wished he had signed with the New York Mets instead, and that he had heeded the advice of his agent, Scott Boras. (See Opt out controversy.)

====2001–2002====
Rodriguez&#x27;s power-hitting numbers improved with his move to the Texas Rangers. In his first season there, Rodriguez produced one of the top offensive seasons ever for a shortstop, leading the American League with 52 home runs, 133 runs scored, and 393 total bases. He became the first player since 1932 with 50 homers and 200 hits in a season, the third shortstop to ever lead the league in homers, and the second AL player in the last 34 seasons (beginning 1968) to lead the league in runs, homers, and total bases; his total base figure is the most ever for a major league shortstop. His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing Ernie Banks&#x27; record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than a first baseman, breaking Phillies 3B Mike Schmidt&#x27;s mark of 48 in 1980. It was his fifth 30-homer campaign, tying Banks for most ever by a shortstop. He also tied for the league lead in extra-base hits (87) and ranked third in RBIs (135) and slugging (.622). He was also among the AL leaders in hits (fourth, 201), average (seventh, .318), and on-base percentage (eighth, .399). He established Rangers club records for homers, runs, total bases, and hit by pitches, had the second-most extra-base hits, and the fourth-highest RBI total. He led the club in runs, hits, doubles (34), homers, RBI, slugging, and on-base percentage and was second in walks (75), stolen bases (18), and game-winning RBI (14) while posting career highs for homers, RBI, and total bases. Rodriguez started 161 games at shortstop and one as the DH, the only major league player to start all of his team&#x27;s games in 2001.

Rodriguez followed the previous year with a major league-best 57 home runs, 142 RBIs and 389 total bases in 2002, becoming the first player to lead the majors in all three categories since 1984. His nine home runs in April matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with Iván Rodríguez (2000), Carl Everett (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2007). He had the sixth-most home runs in AL history, the most since Roger Maris&#x27; league record 61 in 1961 and the most ever for a shortstop for the second straight year. He won the Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading MLB in homers that season. He also won his first Gold Glove Award, awarded for outstanding defense.

His 109 home runs in 2001–02 are the most ever by an American League right-handed batter in consecutive seasons. However, the Rangers finished last in the AL Western division in both years. He finished second in the MVP balloting to fellow shortstop Miguel Tejada, whose 103-win Oakland Athletics won the same division.

====2003====
The 2003 season was Rodriguez&#x27;s last year with the Rangers. He led the American League in home runs, runs scored, and slugging percentage, and won his second consecutive Gold Glove Award. He also led the league in fewest at-bats per home run (12.9) and became the youngest player to hit 300 homers. He was tied with Jim Thome for the MLB lead in homers, and he won his second Babe Ruth Home Run Award.

Following five top-10 finishes in the AL MVP voting between 1996 and 2002, Rodriguez won his first MVP trophy. Rodriguez, a two-time runner up in the balloting by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, joined outfielder Andre Dawson from the 1987 Chicago Cubs as the only players to play on last-place teams and win the award.

Following the 2003 season, Texas set out to part ways with Rodriguez and his expensive contract. The Rangers initially agreed to a trade with the Boston Red Sox, sending Rodriguez to Boston for Manny Ramirez, 19-year old pitching prospect Jon Lester, and cash considerations. However, the Major League Baseball Players Association vetoed the deal because it called for a voluntary reduction in salary by Rodriguez. Despite the failed deal with the Red Sox, the Rangers named him team captain during that off-season.

===New York Yankees===

Yankees third baseman Aaron Boone suffered a knee injury while playing a game of pickup basketball that sidelined him for the entire 2004 season, creating a hole at third base.

On February 15, 2004, the Rangers traded Rodriguez to the New York Yankees for second baseman Alfonso Soriano and a player to be named later (Joaquín Árias was sent to the Rangers on March 24). The Rangers also agreed to pay $67 million of the $179 million left on Rodriguez&#x27;s contract. Rodriguez agreed to switch positions from shortstop to third base, paving the way for the trade, because the popular Derek Jeter was already entrenched at shortstop. This was only the second time in MLB history that a reigning MVP was traded, with the first coming in 1914 when Eddie Collins was traded to the Chicago White Sox from the Philadelphia Athletics for cash considerations. Rodriguez also had to switch uniform numbers; he had worn 3 his entire career, but the number was retired by the Yankees in honor of Babe Ruth. Instead, Rodriguez chose to change his number to 13, in honor of Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. A Miami native himself, Rodriguez had grown up watching Marino and also wore number 13 when he played quarterback in high school.

====2004====
During his first season with the Yankees, Rodriguez hit .286 with 36 home runs, 106 RBIs, 112 runs scored and 28 stolen bases. He became one of only three players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBIs in seven consecutive seasons, joining Hall of Famers Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx. The 112 runs marked the ninth straight season in which he scored at least 100 runs, the longest such streak in the Major Leagues since Hank Aaron did it in 13 straight seasons from 1955 to 1967, and the longest in the American League since Mickey Mantle did it also in nine straight seasons from 1953 to 1961. During the 2004 season, he also became the youngest player ever to reach 350 home runs and the third youngest to reach 1,000 RBIs. He was elected to the 2004 American League All-Star Team, the eighth All-Star selection of his career and the first as a third baseman. On July 24, 2004, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, which led to a scuffle with Boston Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek, and a bench-clearing brawl between both teams. On defense, he had the lowest range factor among non-platoon AL third basemen (2.39) in his first year at the position. He finished 14th in balloting for the AL MVP Award.

In the 2004 ALDS, Rodriguez was a dominant hitter against the Minnesota Twins, batting .421 and slugging .737 while delivering two key extra-inning hits. Following the series win, Rodriguez&#x27;s first season with the Yankees culminated in a dramatic playoff series against the team he had almost ended up playing for: the Yankees&#x27; bitter rival, the Boston Red Sox. In that series (ALCS) he equaled the single-game post-season record with five runs scored in Game 3 at Boston.

One of the most controversial plays of Rodriguez&#x27;s career occurred late in Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series. With one out and Derek Jeter on first base in the bottom of the eighth inning, Rodriguez hit a slow roller between the pitcher&#x27;s mound and the first-base line. Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo fielded the ball and ran towards Rodriguez to apply a tag. As Arroyo reached towards him, Rodriguez swatted at his glove, knocking the ball loose. As the ball rolled away, Jeter scored all the way from first as Rodriguez took second on the play, which was initially ruled an error on Arroyo. However, the umpires quickly huddled, then ruled that Rodriguez was out for interference. Jeter was sent back to first base, and his run was nullified. The Yankees would then lose the ALCS to the eventual World Series champion Red Sox after leading the series three games to none.

====2005–2006====
In 2005, Rodriguez hit .321, leading the American League with 124 runs and 48 home runs while driving in 130 runs. He became the first Yankee to win the American League home run title since Reggie Jackson (41) in 1980. He also became one of only two players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBIs in eight consecutive seasons (Jimmie Foxx accomplished the feat in nine straight seasons from 1932 to 1940). Rodriguez established the franchise record for most home runs in a single season by a right-handed batter (broke Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s mark of 46 in 1937). His 47 home runs from the third base position are a single-season American League record. Rodriguez hit 26 home runs at Yankee Stadium in 2005, establishing the single-season club record for right-handed batters (previously held by DiMaggio in 1937 and Gary Sheffield in 2004). On June 8, at 29 years, 316 days old, he became the youngest player in MLB history to reach the 400 home run mark. 2005 also marked the tenth straight season that Rodriguez scored at least 100 runs. On defense, however, he had the lowest range factor in the league at third for the second straight season (2.62).

On April 26, Rodriguez hit three home runs off Angels&#x27; pitcher Bartolo Colón and drove in 10 runs. The 10 RBIs were the most by a Yankee since Tony Lazzeri established the franchise and American League record with 11 on May 24, 1936. Rodriguez became the 11th major leaguer to accomplish the feat.

Rodriguez won his second AL MVP Award in three seasons, becoming the fifth player to win this award with two different teams, joining Mickey Cochrane, Jimmie Foxx, Frank Robinson and Barry Bonds. He also became the first AL player from outside the American League West to win the award since Mo Vaughn of the Boston Red Sox won in 1995. Rodriguez was also named the shortstop on the Major League Baseball Latino Legends Team in 2005.
Prior to the season, Rodriguez opted to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic.

Rodriguez was again an All-Star in 2006. His 2,000th hit, on July 21, 2006 − six days prior to his 31st birthday − was also his 450th home run. Rodriguez became the youngest player in baseball history to reach 450 home runs (surpassing Ken Griffey Jr., by 267 days), and the eighth player to reach 2,000 hits before turning 31. Ty Cobb reached the mark while still 29, while Rogers Hornsby, Mel Ott, Hank Aaron, Joe Medwick, Jimmie Foxx, and Robin Yount all achieved their 2,000th hit at age 30. All seven are members of baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

For the season, Rodriguez finished fourth in the league in RBI (121), fifth in runs scored (113), eighth in home runs (35) and walks (90), and ninth in OBP (.392). He also led all AL third basemen in errors, with 24, and had the lowest fielding percentage (.937) and—for the third straight season—range factor (2.50) among them. Rodriguez also became the second player in Major League history to record at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBIs in nine consecutive seasons, joining Foxx. It was Rodriguez&#x27;s 11th consecutive season with more than 100 runs scored, the longest such streak in American League history since Lou Gehrig did so in 13 straight seasons (1926–38). Despite this success, it was perceived as one of his lesser-accomplished seasons and was harshly criticized throughout the 2006 season. He has commented that 2006 was his most difficult season as a professional.

====2007====
When Rodriguez reported to camp in 2007, he had reduced his body fat from 16% the year before to 9%. He made light of this fact during a &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; sketch that was filmed during Spring training, which featured him shirtless being rubbed down with suntan lotion. He revealed to the press that he and Jeter were no longer close friends. Rodriguez also reduced his high leg kick at the plate, increasing his bat speed, making him less-apt to strike out and a more dangerous hitter.

In the Yankees&#x27; fourth game of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs against the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium, including his 14th-career grand slam to end the game. The walk-off grand slam was the third of his career, tying the major league mark for game-ending grand slams shared by Vern Stephens and Cy Williams. Rodriguez also began the season by becoming the ninth major leaguer—and first Yankee—to hit six home runs in the first seven games of the season. Rodriguez also became the first Yankee to hit seven home runs in the first ten games of the season.

On April 23, Rodriguez became the first player in major league history to hit 14 home runs in a span of 18 games, and also tied the MLB record for most home runs in April. His total of 34 RBIs in April was one short of Juan González&#x27; AL and MLB record. In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on May 30, Rodriguez sparked controversy when he shouted during a routine play and an infielder let a pop fly drop, costing the Blue Jays three runs. The Yankees went on to win the game, 10–5. On July 12, Rodriguez hit his 150th career home run in a Yankees uniform. This made him the first, and so far only, player in major league history to ever hit 150 home runs for three different teams. He became the third player to hit at least 100 home runs for three teams, following Reggie Jackson and Darrell Evans.

Rodriguez hit his 500th career home run against pitcher Kyle Davies of the Kansas City Royals on August 4. Rodriguez became the youngest player ever to reach 500 home runs at 32 years, 8 days. He surpassed the nearly 67-year record held by Jimmie Foxx, who hit his 500th home run at 32 years, 338 days during the final week of the 1940 major league baseball season. On September 25, Rodriguez became the fifth Major League player to record a 50-home run, 150-RBI season when he hit a grand slam. As of 2025, Rodriguez is the most recent player to have recorded at least 150 RBIs in one season.
In 2007, Rodriguez became the first player in major league history to have at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBIs in 10 consecutive seasons, surpassing Jimmie Foxx (nine consecutive seasons). He led the AL in home runs (54), RBIs (156), slugging percentage (.645), OPS (1.067), total bases (376), and times on base (299), and was second in hit by pitch (21), extra-base hits (85), and at bats per home run (10.8), fourth in on-base percentage (.422) and sacrifice flies (9), seventh in walks (95) and plate appearances (708), eighth in intentional walks (11), and ninth in games (158). He led MLB in home runs and won his third Babe Ruth Home Run Award.

After the season, Rodriguez was named the AL MVP for the third time in his career, receiving 26 first-place votes out of a possible 28. He also won the Silver Slugger Award for his position, the Players Choice Award for Outstanding AL Player, and the Players Choice Award for Player of the Year.

====Opt-out controversy====
The 2007 season marked the last year of Rodriguez&#x27;s 10-year, $252 million contract before he opted out and became a free agent again. Rodriguez had repeatedly stated during the 2007 season that he would like to remain a Yankee for the rest of his career. On October 28, 2007, Rodriguez&#x27;s agent, Scott Boras, announced that he would not renew his contract with the Yankees citing that he &quot;was unsure of the future composition&quot; of the team. Because of the opt-out, the Yankees also lost $21.3 million in remaining payments from the Rangers as part of their agreement from the 2004 trade. Rodriguez received a slew of criticism from fans and writers alike not only for opting out, but also for not meeting with Yankee management before he did. He was further criticized for the timing of his announcement, during the eighth inning of Game 4 of the World Series, as the Boston Red Sox were wrapping up their victory over the Colorado Rockies; even MLB&#x27;s chief operating officer, Bob DuPuy, called it an attempt by Boras to &quot;try to put his selfish interests and that of one individual player above the overall good of the game.&quot;

Teammate Mariano Rivera convinced Rodriguez to contact the New York Yankees ownership. He contacted them directly, bypassing Boras (Boras also apologized for the timing of the announcement). Subsequently, Rodriguez issued a statement on his website, saying that he wished to stay with the Yankees. On November 15, 2007, the New York Yankees and Rodriguez agreed on the &quot;basic framework&quot; of a 10-year, $275 million contract that would have him playing until he was 42. The contract, finalized December 13, included various multimillion-dollar incentives for breaking career home run milestones.

====2008====

Rodriguez hit his 549th home run in a September 3, 2008, game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The opposing manager objected that the ball was foul, and for the first time in MLB history, instant replay (a process officially introduced a few days earlier) was used to review the play and uphold the umpires&#x27; ruling. He was one of only four batters in the AL to have at least 18 home runs and 18 stolen bases in both 2007 and 2008, along with Torii Hunter, Ian Kinsler, and Grady Sizemore. Rodriguez hit a home run every 14.6 at-bats in 2008, the second-best ratio on the team behind Jason Giambi. Rodriguez played 138 games during the 2008 season with a .302 average, 35 home runs, 103 RBI, and an AL best .573 slugging percentage.

====Early 2009: Report of positive test for steroids====
On February 7, 2009, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that Rodriguez tested positive for testosterone and the anabolic steroid Primobolan in 2003. Rodriguez&#x27;s name appears on a government-sealed list of 104 major-league players (out of 1200 tested) who came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The report was compiled as part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2003 survey to see whether mandatory random drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive steroid test. Rodriguez did not immediately confirm the allegations, deferring at first to the players&#x27; union. Two days after the allegations, Rodriguez admitted to steroid use from 2001 until 2003, claiming that he ceased using such substances after spring training that year.

====2009 regular season====
Prior to the 2009 season, Rodriguez was scheduled to represent the Dominican Republic in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, but he was forced to withdraw when an MRI revealed a cyst in his right hip. When he went to have the cyst drained, it was discovered that he was also suffering from a torn labrum in the same hip. Rodriguez opted to undergo an arthroscopic procedure with a recovery period of six to nine weeks, instead of the usual three to four months. Although the procedure should have allowed him to make it through the season without any complications, he required a second, more extensive surgery in the off-season.

After missing spring training and the first month of the season, Rodriguez returned to the Yankees in a May 8 game against the Baltimore Orioles and hit a three-run home run on the first pitch of his first at-bat. The Yankees had stumbled to a 13–15 record in Rodriguez&#x27; absence, and his return fortified the lineup and provided much-needed protection for three-hole hitter Mark Teixeira, who was a notoriously slow starter. Rodriguez also supplied some late-game heroics. On May 16, his two-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the eleventh inning gave the Yankees a 6–4 win over the Minnesota Twins. One week later, he hit a game-tying solo home run in the bottom of the ninth off Philadelphia Phillies closer Brad Lidge in a game the Yankees would go on to win, 5–4.

By early June, the Yankees had surged to first place in the AL East. The club&#x27;s fortunes changed later in the month, when Rodriguez fell into a slump that saw his batting average plummet as the Yankees fell to second place. On June 23, Rodriguez became the eighth active player to reach 8,000 career at-bats in the seventh inning of the Yankees and Braves game. On June 25, Rodriguez belted homer 563 of his career, off Atlanta Braves starter Derek Lowe, and tying Reggie Jackson for 11th on the all-time home run list. On June 26, Rodriguez surpassed Jackson for 11th on the all-time home run list, against the New York Mets in the Subway Series, and against the Angels on July 11, Rodriguez passed Rafael Palmeiro for 10th place; it was his 65th home run against Anaheim, the most by any active player against an opponent.

On October 4, 2009, during the final game of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs in the sixth inning that drove in seven runs, setting an American League record for most RBI by a batter in a single inning, and giving him his 12th consecutive season, 13 overall, of reaching 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie with Manny Ramirez, Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx for the most in MLB history.

====2009 postseason====
Dating back to Game 4 of the 2004 AL Championship Series, Rodriguez had batted with 38 runners on base over a span of 61 postseason at-bats. He stranded every one of them, going 0-for-29 with runners on base. However, in the first game of the 2009 ALDS against Minnesota, he hit two RBI singles − both coming with two outs. In Game 2, he hit an RBI single in the sixth, and hit a game-tying homer off closer Joe Nathan in the bottom of the ninth inning. In Game 3, he again hit a game-tying home run. In the ALCS, Rodriguez hit his third game-tying home run of the postseason in Game 2 in the bottom of the 11th against Angels closer Brian Fuentes. For the series, he batted 9–21 (.429) with three home runs and six runs batted in.

The Yankees faced the Phillies in the World Series. In Game 3, Rodriguez hit what appeared to be a double off a camera perched atop the outfield wall, but after protest by Yankee manager Joe Girardi, the play was reviewed and ruled a home run. In Game 4, Rodriguez drove in the go-ahead run with two outs in the ninth inning off closer Brad Lidge. The Yankees would go on to win the game 7–4 to take a 3-games-to-1 lead in the series. Despite a 2–4 performance with three RBI in Game 5, the Yankees lost 8–6 to force the Series to return to the Bronx for Game 6. Rodriguez was 1–2 with 2 walks and two runs scored in Game 6, as the Yankees went on to defeat the Phillies 7–3 for their 27th World Series Championship, the first of Rodriguez&#x27;s career. Having reversed his postseason misfortunes, he was the Babe Ruth Award winner as the 2009 postseason MVP, in which he batted .365 with six home runs and 18 RBI.

====2010–2012====
On August 4, 2010, on the three-year anniversary of his 500th home run, Rodriguez became the seventh player in major league history to hit 600 home runs, hitting number 600 off Shaun Marcum of the Toronto Blue Jays, becoming the youngest player to do so at 35 years and 8 days old. On August 14, Rodriguez hit three home runs in a game against the Kansas City Royals. In the top of the sixth, he hit his first, a solo dinger to left center. In the top of the seventh, he hit his second, a two-run shot to dead center. In the top of the ninth, he hit his third, a towering two-run blast into the waterfall in Kauffman Stadium. On September 6, he recorded his 100th RBI; it was the 14th year he had reached the mark, the most times of any player in baseball history. On September 29, he hit his 30th home run of the season, recording his major league record 13th straight year of at least 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie with Jimmie Foxx, who had 12 seasons.

In 2011, Rodriguez batted .295 with 13 home runs and 52 RBIs prior to the All-Star break. Despite good production, Rodriguez suffered the longest single-season home run drought of his career by not hitting one in 85 at-bats. Although elected to start the game, Rodriguez opted for arthroscopic surgery on his knee to repair a torn meniscus that impacted his power, and was placed on the disabled list. On top of recovery, Rodriguez was facing serious allegations that he participated in illegal, underground poker games. One of those games reportedly turned violent and cocaine was openly used. However, Rodriguez denied through a representative that he ever participated in illegal poker games. An MLB Executive has said that if Rodriguez was indeed proven guilty, he may face a suspension; MLB had warned Rodriguez in 2005 not to participate in such games.

Rodriguez returned to the Yankees on August 21, playing third base against the Minnesota Twins, going 0-for-4. He sustained another injury with a jammed thumb while trying to make a play in that game. He returned to the Yankees on August 25, going 2-for-4 with two singles in a win for the Yankees over the Oakland Athletics. On August 26, Rodriguez hit his first home run since coming off the disabled list, a solo shot off Baltimore Orioles pitcher Tommy Hunter. He concluded the season with 16 home runs and 62 RBIs in 99 games, ending his major league-record streak of 13 straight seasons of 30 homers and 100 RBIs.

Rodriguez hit his 23rd career grand slam off Atlanta Braves relief pitcher Jonny Venters on June 12, 2012, which tied Lou Gehrig for the most in MLB history. In a road loss versus the Seattle Mariners on July 24, 2012, Rodriguez took a hit to the hand during an eighth-inning at bat versus Seattle starting pitcher Félix Hernández. The injury was later described as a non-displaced fracture. Rodriguez was placed on the disabled list. Earlier in the same game, Hernandez struck out Rodriguez in the sixth inning, making Rodriguez the fifth player to record 2,000 career strikeouts in MLB history.

During the 2012 postseason, Rodriguez was removed for a pinch hitter multiple times and did not start many times. He batted 3-for-25 overall, and went 0-for-18 with 12 strikeouts against right-handed pitchers. He batted .111 in the 2012 ALCS. The Yankees were eliminated by the Tigers in the 2012 ALCS.

====2013====

On January 16, 2013, Rodriguez underwent arthroscopic surgery in his hip to repair a torn labrum. It was the second time in four years that he had the surgery, although the operation was more serious than before. Rodriguez began the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list.

While rehabilitating his hip, Rodriguez was embroiled in a series of negative headlines: he became a central figure of the Biogenesis baseball scandal and MLB&#x27;s investigation into his possible connection to performance-enhancing drugs. Around the same time, Rodriguez announced on Twitter that his doctor had medically cleared him to play in games. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, much to his dismay, soon revealed that Rodriguez&#x27;s doctor did not have such authority to clear him.

Rodriguez played his first rehab assignment game on July 2, 2013, with the Yankees Class-A Low affiliate, the Charleston RiverDogs. He continued his rehabilitation and played for the Yankees Triple-A team, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders on July 18. Two days prior to his scheduled promotion to the major league roster, Rodriguez sustained a new injury, as an MRI later revealed a Grade 1 quad strain, delaying his return and forcing him to continue rehabilitating in the minor leagues. Rodriguez independently sought a second opinion on his quad strain on July 24 with a doctor who stated that there did not appear to be an injury; the Yankees front office expressed further dismay, claiming that he violated league rules for seeking a second opinion without the team&#x27;s permission. He completed his rehabilitation program with the Yankees&#x27; Double-A affiliate Trenton Thunder.

Rodriguez made his 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5, which was the same day that MLB announced he would be suspended—pending an appeal—through the 2014 season for his role in the Biogenesis scandal. On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs. Rodriguez continued to feud with the Yankees front office following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez&#x27;s legal team contended that the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012, despite his condition. Yankees team president Randy Levine expressed negative comments towards Rodriguez, saying that he would &quot;feel happy if Rodriguez never played again&quot;. In response to the accusations, Cashman said, &quot;I&#x27;m not comfortable talking to Alex about this because we feel we are in a litigious environment. Hello and goodbye, that&#x27;s about it.&quot; He added, &quot;It&#x27;s not just Yankees&#x27; management. He&#x27;s putting it at the level of our trainers, our medical staff. The organization. The team.&quot;

During a game against the Red Sox on August 18, 2013, Rodriguez was involved in key moments against Ryan Dempster. The first time he faced Dempster, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch on a 3–0 count, leading to home plate umpire Brian O&#x27;Nora warning both benches and ejecting Girardi, while Dempster was allowed to stay in the game. Later in the top of the sixth inning, Rodriguez encountered Dempster again, hitting a 442-foot home run to straightaway center. The Yankees won 9–6, and Dempster, who hit Rodriguez before, was suspended five games by the league with an undisclosed fine (although he did not miss a start).

On September 20, at Yankee Stadium, Rodriguez hit his 24th career grand slam, an opposite field 654th career home run, off George Kontos of the San Francisco Giants, breaking the all-time grand slam record, formerly held by Lou Gehrig. For the 2013 season, Rodriguez played in only 44 games batting .244 with seven home runs and 19 RBI.

====2014: Suspension due to Biogenesis scandal====
Rodriguez&#x27;s suspension that was announced the previous season but delayed pending an appeal, was upheld, resulting in him being suspended for the entirety of the 2014 regular season and postseason. At the end of the 2014 season, general manager Brian Cashman announced that Rodriguez would no longer serve as an everyday third baseman after the team&#x27;s signing of Chase Headley, and would instead serve as a designated hitter.

====2015====
In the off-season, during the week of January 19, 2015, it was reported that Rodriguez met with new Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred. The pair reportedly had a &quot;positive discussion...in which Rodriguez apologized, while promising to behave in the future&quot;. On February 17, 2015, Rodriguez issued a hand-written letter of apology to &quot;Major League Baseball, the Yankees, the Steinbrenner family, the Players Association and you, the fans&quot;.

Rodriguez reported to New York Yankees&#x27; 2015 spring training camp three days early. Girardi planned to play Rodriguez at first base during spring training to assess whether he could be played there, a first for his career.

Rodriguez played his first game after his suspension on opening day against the Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. He served as the designated hitter, going 1 for 2 with a walk as the Yankees lost to the Blue Jays 1–6. On April 17, his first multi-HR game – and third and fourth home runs – of the season included a blast off Nate Karns of Tampa Bay that traveled , providing four total RBIs in a 5–4 win. In a pinch-hit appearance against the Red Sox on May 1, Rodriguez hit his 660th career home run off reliever Junichi Tazawa, tying Willie Mays for fourth place on the all-time home run list. On May 7, Rodriguez hit his 661st career home run off Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman for sole possession of fourth place on the all-time home run list. On May 27, Rodriguez set an AL record for the most career RBI, passing Lou Gehrig, also moving him into third on the all-time list.

With his 666th career home run against Bud Norris of the Orioles on June 13, Rodriguez drove in his 2,000th and 2,001st career runs. However, opinions varied on whether he was the second (Elias Sports Bureau, trailing Aaron), third (MLB, trailing Aaron and Ruth), or fourth player (Baseball-Reference.com, trailing Aaron, Ruth, and Cap Anson) in MLB history to attain 2,000 RBIs. Rodriguez&#x27; next home run was also his 3,000th career hit, making him the 29th player to reach the milestone. He hit it against the Tigers&#x27; Justin Verlander in a 7–2 win, joining Wade Boggs and Jeter – both former Yankees – as the only players to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit. With his next hit on June 20, Rodriguez surpassed Roberto Clemente, the eleventh player in MLB history to have recorded 3,000 hits. On July 25, against the Twins in Minnesota, and two days before his 40th birthday, Rodríguez became the fifth-oldest player to hit three home runs in one game.

In his first 95 games of the season, Rodriguez hit 24 homers and produced an OPS of .930. After being mired in a 72-at-bat slump without a home run until August 18 against the Twins, he hit his 25th home run which was also his 25th career grand slam, extending his major league record. The home run also drove in the go-ahead runs for an 8–4 Yankees win.
From August 1 until the end of the season, Rodriguez appeared in 56 games, batting .191, .678 OPS, nine home runs, and struck out 59 times in 183 at-bats. The first base experiment yielded two total appearances in 2015. He finished with 33 home runs, 86 RBI, 131 hits, and a .252 batting average. He led the Yankees in home runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, on-base plus slugging, and bases-on-balls. Rodriguez reached 30+ home runs for the 15th time in his career, tying Aaron for the most 30-home-run seasons in history.

====2016====
On April 17, 2016, Rodriguez became the 19th player to make 12,000 career plate appearances. On May 4, the Yankees placed him on the 15-day disabled list due to a right hamstring strain. On May 24, the Yankees sent him on a rehab assignment to the Double-A Trenton Thunder, and activated him on May 26. The next day, he hit his 30th career home run at Tropicana Field, which traveled an estimated , as the Yankees defeated Tampa Bay, 4–1. However, for much of the season, Rodriguez notably struggled to adequately produce, enduring prolonged slumps as his role dwindled from everyday designated hitter to pinch hitter. In July, he had two extra base hits, including his 696th career home run. 

At a press conference held on August 7, Rodriguez announced that he would play in his final game for the Yankees on the following Friday, August 12, against the Rays at Yankee Stadium. It was also noted that the Yankees would sign him to a new contract that would keep him in the organization through 2017 as a special instructor and advisor. In the offseason, Rodriguez would join the Yankees&#x27; front office as a special advisor. The club commemorated Rodriguez&#x27;s final game as a Yankee, thanking him in front of a sold-out crowd for his efforts with a tribute of highlights on the stadium videoboard, a presentation of a framed number 13 jersey, and a base autographed by teammates. At the plate, he batted third and started as the designated hitter, going 1-for-4 with an RBI double. In the ninth inning, he was brought onto the field at third base for one batter − his only defensive appearance for the Yankees in 2016 − and departed the field to a &quot;raucous ovation&quot; from the fans. The next day, the Yankees granted him his unconditional release. His vacated roster spot was filled by future MVP Aaron Judge.

Rumors swirled regarding Rodriguez&#x27;s future in baseball; the Miami Marlins were interested in signing him to play first base until his spokesman Ron Berkowitz emailed the media on August 15 and said on behalf of Rodriguez, &quot;I want to put all this talk to rest about Alex playing for any team this season. It&#x27;s not happening. Like he said Friday night, he is happy and he is going to take some time to relax and hang with his family and friends.&quot; Rodriguez ended the season playing 65 games with a .200 batting average, nine home runs and 31 RBIs.

In January 2017, Rodriguez&#x27;s spokesman said that he would not play for any other team in the coming year, and would remain a &quot;special advisor&quot; to Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner.

==Criticism==

Due to the unsuccessful nature of the Yankees postseasons from 2004 to 2007, along with Rodriguez&#x27;s sub-.200 batting average in the postseasons of 2005 and 2006, Rodriguez drew criticism in the New York area, both from writers, such as the &quot;New York Post&quot; Joel Sherman, and players, such as then-teammate, Jason Giambi. Prior to 2009, Rodriguez had received the nickname &quot;The Cooler&quot; among some players because of the perceived tendency for teams to turn cold when he joins them and hot when he leaves. According to Yankee manager Joe Torre&#x27;s 2009 book, &quot;The Yankee Years&quot;, Rodriguez earned the nickname &quot;A-Fraud&quot; from teammates and particularly from clubhouse attendants who were said to resent his demands. &quot;It was [said] in front of him,&quot; Torre later said of the nickname. &quot;A lot of that stuff that went on in the clubhouse was more tongue-in-cheek, fun type stuff,&quot; he explained.

Much of the criticism regarding Rodriguez focuses on his alleged inability to produce hits in clutch situations. In 2008, Rodriguez hit only .264 with runners in scoring position and two outs. In 95 plate appearances, he walked 20 times and was hit by three pitches, and he had only 19 hits. Of the 41 times Rodriguez struck out with two outs, 20 came with runners in scoring position.

Because of the Yankees&#x27; successful history, he was compared unfavorably to other Yankees greats who have performed exceptionally well in the postseason, such as Reggie Jackson. However, after his performance in the 2009 postseason, Rodriguez started receiving many positive comparisons to Reggie Jackson, even being selected as &quot;Mr. October&quot; by Jackson and &quot;USA Today&quot;.

Rodriguez answered many of the criticisms of his postseason performance by performing exceptionally well in the 2009 postseason, where he posted a .365 batting average and hit six home-runs in 52 at-bats during the Yankees&#x27; 15 post-season games.

==Use of performance-enhancing drugs==
In July 2007, former outfielder and steroid-user Jose Canseco said that he was planning to publish another book about Major League Baseball, to follow his 2005 bestseller &quot;&quot;. Canseco said his new book would have &quot;other stuff&quot; on Rodriguez, and called him a hypocrite. At the time, Rodriguez denied accusations of steroid use. In a 2007 interview with Katie Couric, Rodriguez flatly denied ever having used performance-enhancing drugs.

In February 2009, Selena Roberts and David Epstein of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that Rodriguez had tested positive for two anabolic steroids, testosterone and Primobolan, during his 2003 season playing for the Texas Rangers, the same season in which he captured his first American League Most Valuable Player award, broke 300 career home runs (hitting 47 that year), and earned one of his ten Silver Slugger Awards. The information had been part of a government-sealed report detailing 104 major league players (out of 1200 players tested) who tested positive for performance enhancers during a 2003 drug survey. Approved by the players themselves with the promise of anonymity, the survey was conducted by Major League Baseball to see whether a mandatory drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, as the result of a collectively bargained union agreement, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive test. Because more than 5% of the samples taken from players in 2003 came back positive, mandatory testing of major league baseball players began in 2004, with penalties for violations.
The 2003 test results were supposed to remain anonymous and the samples destroyed. However, a coded master list of 104 players was seized during the BALCO investigation, turning up in a 2004 federal raid on Comprehensive Drug Testing&#x27;s facility in Long Beach, California. A month later, the physical samples were seized by federal agents raiding Quest Diagnostics in Las Vegas, Nevada. The list of the 104 positive-testing players was released to the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) in 2004. The players&#x27; union later said that the 104 positive samples were in the process of being destroyed when they were subpoenaed by federal authorities in November 2003, making continued destruction &quot;improper.&quot;

Although testosterone is available by prescription for some uses, Primobolan has no approved prescription use. Also known as &quot;methenolone&quot; or &quot;metenolone enanthate&quot;, it is the same steroid that Barry Bonds is alleged to have tested positive for in 2000 and 2001. A fairly weak steroid on its own, it is generally used in conjunction with other steroids. The drug is generally preferred in injected rather than oral form due to its cost. An official statement by Major League Baseball made shortly after Rodriguez&#x27;s test results became public expressed &quot;grave concern&quot; without naming Rodriguez, noting that &quot;because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be non-disciplinary and anonymous, we can not make any comment on the accuracy of this report as it pertains to the player named.&quot;

In an interview with ESPN after the report came out, citing &quot;an enormous amount of pressure to perform&quot;, Rodriguez admitted to using banned substances from 2001 to 2003. &quot;All my years in New York have been clean,&quot; he added, saying he has not used banned substances since last taking them following a spring training injury in 2003 while playing for the Rangers. &quot;Back then, [baseball] was a different culture,&quot; Rodriguez said. &quot;It was very loose. I was young, I was stupid, I was naïve. And I wanted to prove to everyone that I was worth being one of the greatest players of all time. I did take a banned substance. And for that, I am very sorry and deeply regretful.&quot; Rodriguez said he could not be sure of the name(s) of the substance(s) he had used.

Rodriguez said he was never told that he was among the 104 players who tested positive, only that a tip came in August 2004 from Gene Orza of the MLBPA that he &quot;may or may not have&quot; failed his 2003 test. Orza is accused by three (unnamed) MLB players of tipping Rodriguez to an upcoming drug test in September 2004. Orza and the MLBPA have denied the allegations.

Rodriguez absolved the players&#x27; union of any blame for leaking his positive test results, saying he alone was responsible for his mistakes. Friend and former teammate Doug Glanville, while noting the outrage over Rodriguez&#x27;s years of steroid use, berated Rodriguez&#x27;s critics for their &quot;lack of outrage about how a confidential and anonymous test could be made public.&quot; No Major League player, Glanville wrote, would have participated in the 2003 survey if he had thought the results had even a chance of becoming public. &quot;It has everything to do with privacy. Being A-Rod should not change that fact.&quot;

MLB commissioner Bud Selig briefly considered whether to punish Rodriguez for his admitted steroid use, citing the illegality of the situation, among other things. However, at the time of the testing there were no punishments for this sort of activity. Additionally, his admission to three years of steroid use could be damaging to his image and legacy.

Later in the month, Rodriguez called a press conference in Tampa, Florida, and in the presence of many supportive Yankee teammates, answered reporters&#x27; questions about his 2001–2003 steroid use. Rodriguez said he and a cousin (whom he refused to name) bought an unidentified drug over-the-counter in the Dominican Republic, where it is &quot;known on the streets as boli or bollee.&quot; At Rodriguez&#x27;s instruction, the cousin transported the drug into the United States. For six months of the year, Rodriguez injected himself twice monthly with &quot;boli&quot; (a drug name unfamiliar to experts and perhaps a slang term for Primobolan or Dianabol, although the latter steroid is taken orally). Rodriguez said he did not know whether he was using the drug properly or whether it was safe. Although he &quot;certainly felt more energy&quot;, Rodriguez said it would be &quot;hard to say&quot; whether it gave him a competitive edge.

Rodriguez said he would become a spokesperson for the Taylor Hooton foundation, which educates young people about the dangers of steroid use. He has since spoken at schools about the dangers of steroids.

On February 28, 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Rodriguez had received treatment from Canadian sports doctor Anthony Galea in March 2009. In 2011, Galea reached a plea agreement for bringing unapproved and mislabeled drugs into the United States, including human growth hormone (HGH) and Actovegin. Galea confirmed to the Associated Press that he had treated Rodriguez but claimed that he had only prescribed anti-inflammatories.

===Biogenesis baseball scandal===

Between 2010 and 2012, Rodriguez reportedly received HGH from Biogenesis of America, an anti-aging clinic in Coral Gables, Florida run by Bosch. For much of the summer of 2013, it had been expected that Rodriguez would be suspended for his role in the scandal. The first definitive confirmation came on August 3, 2013, when MLB rebuffed the players&#x27; union&#x27;s last-minute offer to negotiate. Instead, it allowed Rodriguez until the afternoon of August 4 to reach an agreement regarding a suspension or greater punishment for his role in the Biogenesis affair.

On August 5, MLB suspended Rodriguez from August 8 through the end of the 2014 season for violating the league&#x27;s PED policy, a term that was to include a total of 211 regular-season games plus any postseason games. He was one of 13 players suspended for their roles in the scandal. In its official statement, MLB announced that the suspension was based on Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including Testosterone and human Growth Hormone, over the course of multiple years&quot; and &quot;for attempting to cover-up his violations of the Program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the Office of the Commissioner&#x27;s investigation.&quot; Although the standard punishment for a first offense under MLB&#x27;s drug policy is 50 games, MLB had the option of suspending Rodriguez for a longer term under the collective bargaining agreement if it had determined that his actions constituted conduct detrimental to baseball.

Almost immediately after the suspension was announced, Rodriguez announced that he would appeal. He was the only player to do so; the others accepted season-ending 50-game suspensions without appeal. Although MLB commissioner Bud Selig had the option of using his best-interests-of-baseball powers to remove Rodriguez from the field immediately, he chose to suspend Rodriguez under the drug agreement and not the CBA, allowing Rodriguez to continue playing while the appeal was under way. The proposed suspension would include a global lock clause, which would also prevent him from playing in other known leagues, such as Nippon Professional Baseball and the Korea Baseball Championship, as the leagues in those nations honor any suspensions imposed by MLB. Rodriguez hired New York criminal defense lawyer Joe Tacopina.

A lengthy arbitration process followed, but the suspension was upheld on January 11, 2014. However, because Rodriguez was allowed to play during the appeal process, this effectively reduced the suspension to 162 games, the entirety of the 2014 regular-season schedule. Because Rodriguez was on the suspended list retroactive through August 31, the suspension would have included the postseason if the Yankees had qualified, although the team failed to reach the playoffs. Rodriguez issued a statement announcing that he would challenge the decision in federal court. On February 7, 2014, Rodriguez announced his decision to abandon his lawsuit and accept the suspension for the 2014 season. In March 2014, multiple sources reported that Rodriguez had refused to pay the balance of his legal fees, which amounted to more than $3 million. In July 2014, Rodriguez was sued by his lawyers for $380,000 in unpaid legal fees.

In November 2014, it was revealed that in the previous January, Rodriguez had admitted to the Drug Enforcement Administration that he had used performance-enhancing drugs. This was contrary to his comments of 18 days earlier when he had vehemently refuted the allegations and denied having used human growth hormones.

==Personal life==
===Family and relationships===

Rodriguez grew up with two half-siblings, Joe and Suzy, who were born in the Dominican Republic and are children from his mother&#x27;s first marriage. Rodriguez&#x27;s father, Victor, left the family in Miami when Alex was nine years old and moved to New York. Alex next heard from him on the day of the 1993 MLB draft. They met again in 2000.

Rodriguez also has a half-brother, Victor M. Rodriguez, who was born to Alex&#x27;s father Victor Sr. and his then-wife Pouppe Martinez in 1960. The couple divorced a year later, and Victor Jr. was raised by his mother. Victor Jr., who is an officer in the United States Air Force, fell out of touch with Alex for a period of 23 years, until they met at a Texas Rangers game in 2003. His nephew, Joe Dunand, is a professional baseball player.

In 2002, he married Cynthia Scurtis, a psychology graduate he had met at a gym in Miami. The couple&#x27;s first child, Natasha Alexander, was born on November 18, 2004. On April 21, 2008, Cynthia gave birth to their second child, Ella Alexander, in Miami, Florida.

Cynthia Rodriguez filed for divorce on July 7, 2008, citing &quot;emotional abandonment&quot; of her and their children, &quot;extra marital affairs and other marital misconduct&quot; by her husband. Rodriguez responded in court documents that the marriage was &quot;irretrievably broken&quot; but requested that allegations of his &quot;extramarital affairs&quot; be stricken from court records. The couple reached a settlement that September. In July, Madonna responded to rumors of an affair with Rodriguez by issuing a statement saying, &quot;I am not romantically involved in any way with Alex Rodriguez&quot; and that she had &quot;nothing to do with the state of his marriage&quot;.

Rodriguez dated Cameron Diaz from May 2010 to September 2011. He dated model, actress, and former WWE Diva Torrie Wilson from 2011 to 2014. He was then in a short relationship with Anne Wojcicki, the founder of 23andMe, which ended in 2016 after dating for nearly a year.

In February 2017, he began dating American singer and actress Jennifer Lopez. In March 2019, they announced their engagement. In a 2020 interview with Devin Banerjee, Rodriguez described Lopez as &quot;a powerhouse&quot;, stating &quot;I&#x27;ve never met anyone who has the work ethic, the vision, the principles that Jennifer possesses. She does so many things that people call her a triple threat. I call her an octopus threat.&quot; In April 2021, he and Lopez announced the end of their engagement.

<text>Port Hood (Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk: &quot;Kekwiamkek&quot;) is an unincorporated place in the Municipality of the County of Inverness, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is an administrative centre and a service centre for the surrounding area. It is also the site of a registered historic place, Peter Smyth House.

Port Hood Beach is known for its warm waters and for the nearby Port Hood Station Provincial Park.

==History==
The Miꞌkmaq called it Kekwiamkek, meaning &quot;at the place where sand moves slowly,&quot; or sandbar. The first European colonists, the French, called it Juste-au-Corps, meaning waistcoat. The French quarried stone for the Fortress of Louisbourg and built ships at the site. After the English took over Acadia, it was renamed for naval commander Samuel Hood.

Port Hood experienced an economic boom from 1880 to 1910, with coal mining, fishing and marine trade. During the first half of the 1900s, it was served by the Inverness and Richmond Railway. A fire in July 1942 destroyed much of the town&#x27;s business district.
The community was home to the Port Hood Consolidated School, which closed in 2000 and was replaced by Bayview Education Centre.

==Geography==
It is located on Trunk 19 (the &quot;Ceilidh Trail&quot;), approximately 30-minutes drive north from the Canso Causeway which links Cape Breton Island to the Nova Scotia peninsula.

==Climate==

==Notable people==
Al MacInnis: professional ice hockey player who has made generous donations to the local arena, now renamed the Al MacInnis Sports Centre.

<doc id="212483" wikidata="Q329843" url="?curid=212483" title="John Hampden">
<text>John Hampden (24 June 1643) was an English politician from Oxfordshire, who was killed fighting for Parliament in the First English Civil War. An ally of Parliamentarian leader John Pym, and a cousin of Oliver Cromwell, he was one of the Five Members whom Charles I of England tried to arrest in January 1642, a significant step in the outbreak of fighting in August. All five are commemorated at the State Opening of Parliament each year.

When the war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment for the Parliamentarian cause. His death on 18 June 1643 after being wounded in the Battle of Chalgrove Field was considered a significant loss, largely because Hampden acted as a bridge between the different Parliamentarian factions.

His early death meant Hampden avoided the ideological splits that led to the execution of Charles I in January 1649, and establishment of the Commonwealth of England. Combined with a reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule, in 1841 his statue was erected in the rebuilt Palace of Westminster, representing the Parliamentarian cause. Prior to the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.

==Personal details==
John Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in London, eldest son of William Hampden (1570–1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell (1574–1664). The family were long-established in Buckinghamshire, and William was Member of Parliament for East Looe in 1593. After the death of his father in April 1597, his cousin, another William Hampden, was appointed executor but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth; John&#x27;s younger brother, Richard (1596–1659), inherited his estates at Emmington.

Hampden married Elizabeth Symeon in 1619, and they had nine children together prior to her death in 1631, of whom seven survived into adulthood. Ann (1616–1701), Elizabeth (1619–1643), John (1621–1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628–1687), Mary (1630–1689), and Richard (1631–1695), Chancellor of the Exchequer under William III. In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591–1666); they had no children before he died in 1643.

==Career==
===1610 to 1629; Political activism===
Hampden graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford in 1610, and attended the Inner Temple from 1613 to 1615, not necessarily to become a lawyer, but because knowledge of the law was then considered part of a gentleman&#x27;s education. While studying in London, he became involved with other Puritans, a general term for anyone who wanted to &#x27;purify&#x27; the Church of England by removing what they considered to be Catholic practices. Members belonged to a variety of Protestant sects, the most prominent being Presbyterians like Hampden, connecting him to a network that included Richard Knightley, Lord Saye, and John Preston.

In 1621, he became MP for Grampound, a rotten borough in Cornwall controlled by the local magnate, John Arundell; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed Ship Money in the 1630s, but during the First English Civil War held Pendennis Castle for Charles I. Hampden subsequently financed a successful campaign to restore parliamentary representation to Wendover in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. As MP for Wendover in 1626, he sat in the so-called &quot;Useless Parliament&quot;, known as such for failing to pass any legislation. In return for approving taxes, Parliament demanded the impeachment of the Duke of Buckingham, a close friend of the king, and a military commander notorious for inefficiency and extravagance.

Rather than comply, Charles dissolved it and resorted to raising money through forced loans, with over 70 individuals jailed for refusing to pay, including Hampden&#x27;s uncle, Sir Edmund Hampden. When Hampden also declined to subscribe, he was arrested, and while in prison met Sir John Eliot, a leading member of the Parliamentary opposition. When the &quot;loans&quot; failed to produce sufficient income, Charles was forced to call new elections in March 1627, which returned &quot;a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King&quot;, including Hampden, John Selden, Edward Coke, John Pym and a young Oliver Cromwell.

Released to attend the new Parliament, Hampden collaborated with Eliot and others in efforts to limit Royal power. The most significant was the June 1628 Petition of Right, which opened the way to a new impeachment of Buckingham, a campaign that ended after he was assassinated in August 1628 by a disgruntled soldier. The next issue was that of Roger Maynwaring and Robert Sibthorpe, two priests who published sermons supportive of the divine right of kings, passive obedience, and which implied Charles was entitled to raise taxes as he wished.

In the 17th century, many believed &#x27;good government&#x27; and &#x27;true religion&#x27; were closely linked, and alterations in one implied alterations in the other. Using divine right to justify the levying of taxes without the approval of Parliament was inflammatory enough in itself, but Maynwaring also claimed those who disobeyed the king risked eternal damnation, infuriating Puritans who generally believed in Predestination, and salvation through faith. His suggestion &#x27;kings were gods&#x27; was also regarded as blasphemy. Censured for preaching against the established constitution, the two men were later pardoned by Charles, who dismissed Parliament in 1629, and instituted eleven years of Personal Rule.

===1630 to 1639; Ship money===
Hampden&#x27;s role in the 1628 Parliament was largely behind the scenes, where his organisational and man-management skills could be best used, but placed him in the inner circle of parliamentary opposition. In 1629, the Earl of Warwick granted him lands in Saybrook Colony, now Old Saybrook, Connecticut; participation in the colonial movement was common among Puritan leaders. Other participants included Pym, who was treasurer of the Providence Island Company, Warwick, Lord Saye, Knightley, Henry Darley, William Waller, and Lord Brooke. Company meetings provided cover to organise political opposition; whether its members also considered permanent emigration is still disputed.

Hampden remained a relatively obscure figure, until 1637, when he was prosecuted in a test case to confirm the legality of ship money. This was a long-standing levy, raised in coastal counties to fund the Royal Navy, but only in time of war, not every year as Charles was now doing. Opposition was based on the principle of taxes imposed without parliamentary approval, not the tax itself; there was widespread support for a powerful navy to protect English trade.

Its extension into inland counties like Hampden&#x27;s estates in Buckinghamshire widened opposition to its collection, and how it was spent. , a 100 gun warship built between 1634 and 1637, was a prestige project five times the cost of normal ships, too large for any English harbour and too slow to fight the Barbary pirates the Crown claimed justified building ships. Finally, rather than using it to deter Charles used it to transport Spanish bullion and supplies to Flanders for their war against the Protestant Dutch, payment for which he kept.

The parliamentary leaders, including Hampden, owned multiple properties, and to make it clear they only opposed its legality, they were careful to pay some assessments. Hampden was tried by the Court of Exchequer in June 1637, but divisions among the judges delayed their ruling until July 1638. Although seven out of the twelve found the tax legal, the fact five did not made it a public relations disaster for Charles; less than 20% of the £208,000 assessed for 1639 was paid. Many refused demands for &#x27;Coat and conduct&#x27; money during the 1639 and 1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars, fearing if they did, Charles would turn them into permanent taxes.

===1640 to July 1642; the road to civil war===
Following defeat in the first of the Bishops Wars, Charles recalled Parliament in April 1640; when the Short Parliament refused to vote taxes without concessions, he dissolved it after only three weeks. However, the humiliating terms imposed by the Scots after a second victory in 1640 forced him to hold fresh elections in November; Pym acted as unofficial leader of the opposition, with Hampden co-ordinating the different factions. Shortly after the Long Parliament assembled, it was presented with the Root and Branch petition; signed by 15,000 Londoners, it demanded England follow the Scottish example and expel bishops from the Church of England.


This reflected widespread concern over Arminianism in the Church of England, seen as evidence of pro-Catholic policies and confirmed by Charles making war on the Protestant Scots, but not assisting his nephew Charles Louis against the Catholic Emperor. Many feared he was about to sign an alliance with Spain, a view shared by the French and Venetian ambassadors; ending arbitrary rule was thus important for England and the European Protestant cause in general.

Since convention prevented direct attacks on Charles, the alternative was to prosecute his &#x27;evil counsellors&#x27;, showing even if he was above the law, his subordinates were not, and he could not protect them; the intention was to make others think twice about their actions. Laud was impeached in December 1640, and held in the Tower of London; the king&#x27;s chief minister the Earl of Strafford, former Lord Deputy of Ireland and organiser of the 1640 Bishops War, was executed in May 1641.

The Commons also passed a series of constitutional reforms, including the Triennial Acts, abolition of the Star Chamber, and an end to levying taxes without Parliament&#x27;s consent. Voting as a block, the bishops ensured all these were rejected by the Lords. In June 1641, Parliament responded with the Bishops Exclusion Bill, which was rejected by the Lords. The outbreak of the Irish Rebellion in October brought matters to a head; both Charles and Parliament supported raising troops to suppress it, but neither trusted the other with their control.

The Grand Remonstrance was presented to Charles on 1 December 1641; unrest culminated in 23 to 29 December with widespread riots in Westminster, led by the London apprentices. Suggestions Parliamentary leaders helped organise these have not been proved, but it prevented bishops attending the Lords. On 30 December, John Williams, Archbishop of York and eleven other bishops, signed a complaint, disputing the legality of any laws passed by the Lords during their exclusion. Led by Denzil Holles, the Commons ruled this was an invitation for the king to dissolve Parliament, and all twelve were arrested for treason.

On 4 January, Charles tried to arrest the Five Members, including Hampden, Pym and Holles; after it failed, he left London, accompanied by Royalist MPs like Edward Hyde, and members of the Lords. This was a major tactical mistake, as it gave his opponents majorities in both houses. However, even at this late stage, the vast majority on both sides wanted to avoid civil war, and petitioned Parliament and Charles to agree terms.

Pym and Hampden were among the few to understand only military victory could compel Charles to keep his commitments. He openly told foreign ambassadors any concessions were temporary, and would be retrieved by force if needed, an approach confirmed by the Scottish experience. The Irish Catholic rebels claimed approval for their actions; while untrue, the assertion was given weight by his attempts to use Irish troops against the Scots, and initial refusal to condemn the rebellion.

However, regardless of religion or political belief, in 1642 the vast majority believed a &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; monarchy was divinely mandated; where they disagreed was what &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. Since Charles could not be deposed, the only way of dealing with him was through military victory; it was this clarity that set Hampden, Pym, and later Oliver Cromwell apart from the majority. When the First English Civil War began, Hampden was appointed to the Committee of Safety.

===August 1642 to June 1643; War and death===
When war began in August 1642, both sides expected it to be settled by a single, decisive battle; many areas remained neutral, while awaiting the result. Hampden raised a regiment, which acted as artillery escort at the Battle of Edgehill in October and helped repulse the Royalist cavalry. After the disastrous Battle of Brentford, he helped rally troops for the defence of London. However, his main contribution was holding the Parliamentary factions together over the first winter, and preparing for a long war by initiating the negotiations that led to the Solemn League and Covenant with the Scots in August 1643.

When the 1643 campaign began, Hampden was serving with the Earl of Essex, whose lack of aggression was already causing concern. Tasked with taking the Royalist war capital of Oxford, Essex captured Reading on 27 April, where he remained until mid May. On 18 June 1643, Hampden was wounded at the Battle of Chalgrove Field; shot twice in the shoulder, the wound became infected. Later claims these injuries were caused by the explosion of his own pistol have not been substantiated.

He died at home six days later, and was buried in Great Hampden church. Unlike Pym, who died of cancer in December, his loss was mourned on both sides of the conflict; his close friend Anthony Nicholl wrote ‘Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and more faithful friend.’ In 1843, George Nugent-Grenville, a Whig radical politician and author of the hagiographic and often inaccurate &quot;Memorials of John Hampden&quot;, paid for the Hampden Monument, located near the battle site.

==Legacy==
His death in 1643 meant Hampden avoided the bitter internal debates that led to the execution of Charles in 1649, and establishment of the Commonwealth of England. As a result, he is a less complex figure than either Pym or his cousin Oliver Cromwell. One example of this appears in Thomas Gray&#x27;s poem &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;, which includes the lines &quot;Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast / The little tyrant of his fields withstood...Some Cromwell guiltless of his country&#x27;s blood.&quot;

In reality, both he and Pym recognised far earlier than most Charles had to be defeated militarily, but since Hampden rarely made speeches, he was far less visible. In his &#x27;History of the Rebellion&#x27;, Clarendon claimed his influence and reputation derived from his man management skills and organisational abilities. Prior to the 1774 American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams used Hampden to claim rebellion against the state could be reconciled with patriotism, while his death in battle allowed him to be positioned as a martyr to the cause of liberty.

The early 19th century British radical movement set up Hampden Clubs, and he was referenced by Radical poet Percy Shelley. In Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel, Frankenstein, he appears as a symbol of rebellion against patriarchal authority. When the Palace of Westminster was rebuilt after 1834, he was selected as one of the famous Parliamentary figures whose statues are positioned in St Stephen&#x27;s Hall. As one of the Five Members he is annually commemorated at the State Opening of Parliament. The early 20th century Suffragette movement used him to justify their slogan of &#x27;No vote, no tax&#x27;, as do modern anti-tax resisters, although this misses the point he objected to levying them without the approval of Parliament, not the taxes themselves.

A variety of establishments bear his name, in Britain, and other parts of the English-speaking world, notably the United States; these include Hampden-Sydney College, Virginia, founded in 1775, plus numerous schools, towns, counties, hospitals, and geographical points. His enduring popularity as a symbol of Parliamentary freedom continues; Mount Hampden was selected as the location for the new Parliament of Zimbabwe building, due for completion in 2022. One of the London Underground electric locomotives used on the Metropolitan line was named &quot;John Hampden&quot;; retired in 1961, it is now on display in the London Transport Museum. Hampden Park, Scotland’s national football stadium, is named after him. In addition, two Masonic lodges bear his name; Lodge 6290, in Oxfordshire, and 6483 in Buckinghamshire.
