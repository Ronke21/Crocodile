<text>Charles Sidney Grodin (April 21, 1935 – May 18, 2021) was an American actor, comedian, author, and television talk show host. Known for his deadpan delivery and often cast as a put-upon straight man, Grodin became familiar as a supporting actor in many Hollywood comedies of the era. After a small part in &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; in 1968, he played the lead in Elaine May&#x27;s &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; (1972) where he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. As well, he starred in &quot;11 Harrowhouse&quot; (1974), for which he also wrote the adaptation.

He took supporting roles in Mike Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), the 1976 remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;, and Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978). Other notable film roles include &quot;Real Life&quot; (1979), &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot; (1980), &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981), &quot;Ishtar&quot; (1987), &quot;Dave&quot; (1993), and &quot;Clifford&quot; (1994). Grodin also co-starred in the action comedy &quot;Midnight Run&quot; (1988) and the family film &quot;Beethoven&quot; (1992). 

Grodin made his acting debut in 1958 appearing in the NBC anthology series &quot;Decision&quot;. He then appeared in numerous TV serials throughout the next decade. He made frequent appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. He won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special for the &quot;Paul Simon Special&quot; (1978) alongside Chevy Chase, Lorne Michaels, Paul Simon, and Lily Tomlin. He portrayed Carl Shapiro in the miniseries &quot;Madoff&quot; (2016).

Grodin wrote eight books and three plays. He also hosted a talk show on CNBC and, in 2000, was a political commentator for &quot;60 Minutes II&quot;. He returned to acting in Louis C.K.&#x27;s FX show &quot;Louie&quot; and Noah Baumbach&#x27;s film &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot; (2014).

==Early life==
Grodin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Orthodox Jewish parents. His father Theodore (1900–1953) owned a wholesale supplies store, while his mother Lena (1907–1996; née Singer) worked in her husband&#x27;s business and volunteered for disabled veterans. His paternal grandfather changed the family name from Grodinsky to Grodin. His maternal grandfather was an immigrant from Russia who &quot;came from a long line of rabbis&quot; and moved to Baltimore at the turn of the 20th century. Grodin had an older brother named Jack.

Grodin graduated as valedictorian from Peabody High School, where he was elected class president all four years. He attended the University of Miami but left without graduating to pursue acting. He studied acting at HB Studio in New York City under Uta Hagen.

==Career==

===1950s/1960s: Early career===
Grodin&#x27;s film debut was an uncredited bit part in Disney&#x27;s 1954 film &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;. A student of Lee Strasberg and Uta Hagen, he made his Broadway debut in a production of &quot;Tchin-Tchin&quot;, opposite Anthony Quinn. In 1964, he played Matt Stevens on the ABC soap opera &quot;The Young Marrieds&quot;. The next year, he became an assistant to director Gene Saks and appeared on several television series including &quot;The Virginian&quot;.

In 1966, he co-wrote and directed the Broadway play &quot;Hooray! It&#x27;s a Glorious Day...and All That&quot;. Around this time, he turned down the part of Benjamin Braddock in &quot;The Graduate&quot; because of the low salary offered by producer Lawrence Turman, although Turman assured him that the part would make him a star, as it ultimately did for Dustin Hoffman. In 1968, Grodin had a small but pivotal part playing an obstetrician in the horror film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; and directed the Broadway play &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot;. He then directed his first television special, &quot;Songs of America&quot;, with Simon and Garfunkel in 1969.

===1970s/1980s===
After a supporting role in the 1970 film &quot;Catch-22&quot;, Grodin gained recognition as a comedy actor with the lead role in the 1972 film &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;. In 1974, he both starred in and contributed to the screenplay for &quot;11 Harrowhouse&quot;. After that film&#x27;s rocky reception, he returned to New York and took over directing duties of Herb Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Thieves&quot;, which ran on Broadway from 1974 to 1975.

Grodin subsequently appeared in several films during the decade, including the 1976 version of &quot;King Kong&quot;, the hit 1978 comedy &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, and Albert Brooks&#x27;s 1979 comedy &quot;Real Life&quot;. Alongside his work on screen, he remained active on Broadway, frequently appearing in and producing several plays.

In 1981, he landed a role in &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; playing Nicky Holiday, a jewel thief who falls in love with Miss Piggy. He also appeared that same year opposite Lily Tomlin in &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;. His 1980s roles included Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot; (opposite Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn) and 1988&#x27;s well-reviewed comedy &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, a buddy movie co-starring Robert De Niro. Grodin also appeared in the 1986 CBS prime-time-soap sendup &quot;Fresno&quot;, playing the evil son of a raisin matriarch (Carol Burnett).

His Hollywood film roles of the 1980s usually saw him cast as uptight, bland, and world-weary white collar professionals, such as a psychiatrist having a nervous breakdown (&quot;The Couch Trip&quot;), a health-conscious accountant (&quot;Midnight Run&quot;), an ineffectual advertising executive (&quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;), and a lonely, socially awkward nerd (&quot;The Lonely Guy&quot;). He was cast against this type as a scheming CIA agent in &quot;Ishtar&quot;.

Commenting on his work with regard to &quot;Ishtar&quot;, Hal Hinson in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; observed: &quot;Grodin has a one-of-a-kind quality on the screen, a sort of inspired spinelessness. And with his cat-burglar rhythms – he seems to play all his scenes as if someone were asleep in the next room – he&#x27;s become a very sly scene-stealer.&quot; Sandra Brennan at Rovi noted that: &quot;Whereas many funnymen have been popular for their ability to overreact and mug their way around everyday obstacles, Grodin belonged, from the beginning, to the Bob Newhart school of wry comedy that values understatement and subtlety.&quot;

Aside from his film work, he was a frequent presence on television. In 1977, Grodin hosted an episode of the NBC sketch show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where the entire episode revolved around his forgetting that the show was live, and he proceeded to wreck sketches because of his failure to prepare accordingly. His many talk show appearances from the 1970s to the early 2020s often included confrontational and mock angry segments. At one time Johnny Carson &quot;banned&quot; him from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; appearances after taking offense at things Grodin had said. The NBC network would receive angry letters from viewers who didn&#x27;t understand the joke that he was playing a persona, trying to be as different from typical talk show guests as possible. His appearances on &quot;Late Night With David Letterman&quot; would sometimes erupt into shouting and name-calling, but Letterman always enjoyed Grodin&#x27;s segments.

===1990s/2000s: Family films and talk show host===

Grodin&#x27;s career took a turn in 1992, when he played the nervous family man George Newton in the kids&#x27; comedy &quot;Beethoven&quot;, opposite Bonnie Hunt. The film was a box-office hit, and he reprised the role in the 1993 sequel, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot;. Also in 1993, Grodin played the role of Harrison Winslow in the film &quot;Heart and Souls&quot;. After a supporting role in the acclaimed Ivan Reitman comedy &quot;Dave&quot;, Grodin signed on to play The Old
Man in the 1994 limited release sequel to &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;My Summer Story&quot;). That same year also saw the much-delayed release of &quot;Clifford&quot;, in which Grodin portrayed the frustrated uncle opposite Martin Short&#x27;s title role.

From 1995 to 1999, Grodin hosted his own issues-orientated cable news talk show, &quot;The Charles Grodin Show&quot;. It originated as a nightly show on CNBC, replacing Tom Snyder after he left to start &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on CBS. The show was dropped by CNBC in 1998, but aired for a final year as a weekly show on MSNBC before ending its run in late 1999. From 2000 to 2003, he was a political commentator for &quot;60 Minutes II&quot;.

In 2004, Grodin wrote &quot;The Right Kind of People&quot;, an off-Broadway play about co-op boards in certain buildings in Manhattan. Grodin&#x27;s commentaries were heard on New York City radio station WCBS and other affiliates of the CBS Radio Network, as well as on the CBS Radio Network&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Roundup&quot;.

After a 12-year-long hiatus from film, in 2006 Grodin returned to acting in the comedy &quot;The Ex&quot; starring Zach Braff.

=== 2010s: Career resurgence ===
In the 2010s, Grodin made more frequent acting appearances, guest starring on television shows such as &quot;Law and Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;The Michael J. Fox Show&quot;. Grodin had several supporting roles in films, including Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;The Humbling&quot; (2014) and Taylor Hackford&#x27;s &quot;The Comedian&quot; (2016). He had a prominent supporting role in Noah Baumbach&#x27;s &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot; (2015), playing a celebrated documentary filmmaker and the father of one of the lead characters.

In 2015, Grodin was cast in a recurring role in Louis C.K.&#x27;s FX show &quot;Louie&quot; as Dr. Bigelow, C.K.&#x27;s philosophical doctor and mentor in Season 4 and 5. In an interview with &quot;Deadline&quot;, Grodin talked about his relationship with C.K. stating, &quot;I find him to be the single most talented person ... I&#x27;ve ever worked with, he&#x27;s a wonderful director, writer, and actor.&quot;

He also portrayed the philanthropist and defrauded investor Carl J. Shapiro in the 2016 miniseries &quot;Madoff&quot; on ABC based on the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme debacle. His final movie was &quot;An Imperfect Murder: The Private Life of a Modern Woman&quot;, released in 2017.

Grodin was also a prolific author and published his final book in 2013.

==Personal life==
Grodin had two children: daughter Marion (a comedienne), from his marriage to Julie Ferguson, and son, Nicholas, from his marriage to Elissa Durwood. For a period in the 2000s, Grodin gave up show business to be a stay-at-home dad to his children.

==Death==
Grodin died from multiple myeloma at his home in Wilton, Connecticut, on May 18, 2021. He was 86.

<doc id="225945" wikidata="Q924515" url="?curid=225945" title="Hugh Blair">
<text>Hugh Blair FRSE (7 April 1718 – 27 December 1800) was a Scottish minister of religion, author and rhetorician, considered one of the first great theorists of written discourse.

As a minister of the Church of Scotland, and occupant of the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh, Blair&#x27;s teachings had a great impact in both the spiritual and the secular realms. Best known for &quot;Sermons&quot;, a five volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and &quot;Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres&quot;, a prescriptive guide on composition, Blair was a valuable part of the Scottish Enlightenment.

==Life==
Blair was born in Edinburgh into an educated Presbyterian family. His father was John Blair, an Edinburgh merchant. He was great-great-grandson of Rev. Robert Blair of St. Andrews and great nephew of Very Rev. David Blair the Moderator of the General Assembly in 1700.

From an early age it was clear that Blair, a weakly child, should be educated for a life in the church. Schooled at the High School, Blair studied moral philosophy and literature at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.A. at the age of twenty-one. His thesis, &quot;Dissertatio Philosophica Inauguralis de fundamentis et obligatione legis naturae&quot;, serves as a precursor to the later published &quot;Sermons&quot; in its discussion of the principles of morality and virtue.

In 1741, two years after the publication of his thesis, Blair received his license as a Presbyterian preacher. Shortly thereafter, the Earl of Leven heard of Blair&#x27;s popularity and presented him to the Parish Church of Collessie in Fife, as their minister.

By 1743 Blair was elected as the second charge of the Canongate Kirk, under Rev James Walker in first charge. Although some records say he reached &quot;first charge&quot; this is not the case. Blair was appointed to the sole charge of Lady Yester&#x27;s Kirk in 1754, and four years later in 1758 was translated to the second charge of the High Kirk of St Giles under Rev Robert Walker as &quot;first charge&quot;. They became very close friends. Despite being &quot;second charge&quot; this was nevertheless one of the highest positions that a clergyman could achieve in Scotland. Blair maintained this position for many years, during which time he published a five-volume series of his addresses entitled &quot;Sermons&quot;.

Having attained ultimate success in the church, Blair turned to matters of education. In 1757 he was presented with an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by the University of St Andrews and began to lecture in Rhetoric and Belles Lettres for the University of Edinburgh in 1759. At first Blair taught without remuneration from the university and was paid direct by his students, but the popularity of his course led to the institution of a permanent class and Blair was made Professor Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the university in 1762, a position ratified by King George III. He retained this position until his retirement in 1783. After retirement, Blair published several of his lectures in &quot;Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres&quot;.

In 1773 Blair was living at Argyle Square on the south side of Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Town. The property was demolished in the mid-19th century to create Chambers Street.

In 1777, at the point of its creation, he was appointed Chaplain to the 71st Regiment of Foot, initially based at Edinburgh Castle.

In 1783 Blair was one of the founder members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He served as its Literary President from 1789 to 1796.

Blair&#x27;s life was very full in both the public and the private spheres. As a central figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, he surrounded himself with other scholars in the movement. Hume, Carlyle, Adam Smith, Ferguson, and Lord Kames were among those Blair considered friends. 

He had a summer residence in the small village of Restalrig north-east of Edinburgh.

He died at home in Argyle Square on 27 December 1800.

Blair is buried near his home, in Greyfriars Churchyard in Edinburgh. The grave was originally unmarked, but a memorial was erected on the south-west section of Greyfriars Kirk to commemorate him, lying between tablets to Allan Ramsay and Colin MacLaurin. It is inscribed in Latin therefore gives his name as Hugo Blair.

He was succeeded in his chair at Edinburgh University by Andrew Brown (1763-1834). His position as second charge of St Giles was filled by Rev George Husband Baird.

==Family==

Blair had a very loving marriage to his cousin, Katherine Bannatine, whom he married in April 1748. Katherine was the daughter of Very Rev James Bannatine minister of Trinity College Church in north-east Edinburgh. He had been Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1739.

Together they had two children: a son who died at birth and a daughter Katherine (1749-1769) who died at the age of 20 i.e. both children predeceased them. Blair also outlived his wife, who died in February 1795 five years before his own death in December 1800. He was described as &quot;amiable, kind to young authors, and remarkable for a harmless, but rather ridiculous vanity and simplicity&quot;.

==Major works==
Blair is best known for the publication of three major works: &quot;A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian, Son of Fingal&quot;; &quot;Sermons&quot;; and &quot;Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres&quot;. While little attention is given to his other works, Blair published several other works anonymously, the most important of which is an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s works edited by Blair.

=== &quot;A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian, the Son of Fingal&quot; ===
In 1763 Blair published &quot;A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian&quot;, his first well known openly authored publication. Blair, having long taken interest in the Celtic poetry of the Scottish Highlands, wrote a laudatory account of the poems of Ossian, the authenticity of which he maintained. Blair serves as the voice of authority on the legitimacy of the poems that he himself had urged friend James Macpherson to publish in &quot;Fragments of Ancient Poetry&quot;.

The dissertation directly opposes assertions that the poems Macpherson claimed to be ancient and sublime were in fact written by several modern poets, or possibly even by Macpherson himself. After 1765 Dissertation appeared in every publication of the Ossian to give the work credibility. Blair&#x27;s praise ultimately proved futile as the poems were deemed false and Macpherson was convicted of literary forgery. While this work does not speak highly of Blair&#x27;s skills as a literary critic, it does provide insight into Blair&#x27;s own taste, a subject that is important to his later writing.

=== &quot;Sermons&quot; ===
Blair published the first of his five volume series &quot;Sermons&quot; in 1777. It is a compilation of the sermons promoting practical Christian morality he delivered as a Presbyterian preacher. Despite the declining popularity of published religious teachings at the time, the success of &quot;Sermons&quot; paralleled Blair&#x27;s success as a preacher. Though Blair&#x27;s oral delivery was poor, often described as a &#x27;burr,&#x27; he was considered the most popular preacher in Scotland. His success is credited to the ease with which the audience could follow his polite, organised style; a style that was translated easily into print.

&quot;Sermons&quot; reflects Blair&#x27;s position as a member of the moderate or latitudinarian party. In many respects, Blair was socially conservative. He did not believe in radical change, as his teachings were safe and ultimately prepared for the upper classes. Blair also had liberal tendencies demonstrated in his rejection of Calvinistic doctrines such as original sin, total corruption, and damnation.

&quot;Sermons&quot; focuses on questions of morality, rather than theology, and it emphasises patriotism, action in the public sphere, and moral virtue promoted by polite secular culture. Blair encourages people to improve their natural talents through hard work, but also to be content with their appointed stations in society. He urges people to play an active role in society, to enjoy the pleasures of life, to do good works, and to maintain faith in God.

Blair&#x27;s appeal to both emotion and reason, combined with his non-confrontational, moderate and elegant style made each volume of &quot;Sermons&quot; increasingly popular. Four editions were published in Blair&#x27;s lifetime and a fifth shortly after his death. Each volume was met with the greatest success, as they were published in many European languages and went through several printings. Though Blair&#x27;s &quot;Sermons&quot; eventually fell out of favour for lacking doctrinal definiteness—&quot;a bucket of warm water&quot;, as one opinion puts it—they were undoubtedly influential during Blair&#x27;s lifetime and for several decades after his death.

In Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, Mary Crawford, a cynical critic of the church, suggests that a wise clergyman would do better to preach Blair&#x27;s sermons than his own.

=== &quot;Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres&quot; ===

After retiring from his position as Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh in 1783, Blair published his lectures for the first time, deeming it necessary because unauthorised copies of his work threatened the legacy of his teachings. The result is arguably Blair&#x27;s most important work: &quot;Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres&quot;. &quot;Lectures&quot;, a compilation of 47 of Blair&#x27;s lectures given to students at the University of Edinburgh, serves as a practical guide for youth on composition and language, a guide that makes Blair the first great theorist of written discourse.

&quot;Lectures&quot; is important not because it presents radical new theories. In fact, Blair himself admits that the work is a suffusion of his understanding of classical and modern theories of language. &quot;Lectures&quot; draws on the classic works of theorists such as Quintilian and Cicero combined with the modern works of Addison, Burke, and Lord Kames to become one of the first whole language guides. As one of the first works to focus on written discourse, rather than solely on oral discourse, Blair&#x27;s &quot;Lectures&quot; is a comprehensive, accessible prescriptive composition guide that combines centuries of theory in a cohesive form.

The intention of &quot;Lectures&quot; is to provide youth with a simple, organised guide on the value of rhetoric and belles lettres in the quest for upward mobility and social success. Blair believed that social cultivation, and most importantly the proper use of polite literature and effective writing, was the key to social success. For him, an education in literature was socially useful, both in its ability to elevate one&#x27;s social status and its ability to promote virtue and morality. Blair also acknowledged that a person must have virtue and personal character, as well as knowledge of literature to be an effective speaker or writer.
While his lectures certainly provide ideas on how to compose texts, the focus increasing becomes the proper response to written literature. He supplies sample writings from contemporary literature to illustrate the qualities of writings so that students would identify, analyze, and imbibe those qualities. The anticipated result is that students will cultivate a proper taste, and will be able to appreciate the aesthetic qualities in fine language.

Blair&#x27;s concept of taste involved two distinctive aspects of the human mind- a person&#x27;s senses and a person&#x27;s thought processing. Through exercise of the five senses, a person can have their taste refined and perfected. Through a person&#x27;s reasoning abilities, a person can determine what produces genuine pleasure and what produces something inauthentic. When combining exercise and reason, the critic develops taste-delicacy and correctness of taste. Taste delicacy ties into a critic&#x27;s senses, making them stronger and more accurate when it comes to sense of sight, sound, smell, taste etc. Correctness of taste ties into a critic&#x27;s logic process, giving the critic the ability to make a judgment and appraise the merit of something. This also makes it easier to recognize specifically what is good and genuine and what isn&#x27;t pure or legitimate.

While Blair&#x27;s outline of the requirements for an excellent speaker or writer is an important aspect of &quot;Lectures&quot;, the work covers a very broad scope of issues relating to composition. Blair&#x27;s primary considerations are the issues of taste, language, style, and eloquence or public speaking. As well, Blair provides a critical examination of what he calls &quot;the most distinguished species of composition, both in prose and verse&quot; (15).

As an adherer to Scottish common sense realism, Blair&#x27;s theories are founded in the belief that the principles of rhetoric evolve from the principles of nature. Blair&#x27;s definition of taste reflects this sentiment: &quot;The power of receiving pleasure from the beauties of nature and art: (15). His analysis of the nature of taste is one of his most important contributions to compositional theories because taste, according to Blair, is foundational to rhetoric and necessary for successful written and spoken discourse.

While Blair&#x27;s work is generally a safe composite of multiple theories, it contains many valuable insights, such as the aforementioned analysis of taste. Blair&#x27;s discussion of the history of written discourse is another important contribution to composition theory because this history was previously neglected. As well, Blair&#x27;s naming and defining of four generic categories of writing: historical writing, philosophical writing, fictitious history, and poetry, and his analysis of the different parts of discourse plays an important role in the development of later compositional theories. One of Blair&#x27;s more radical ideas is the rejection of Aristotelian figures of speech such as tropes. Blair argues that invention is the result of knowledge and cannot be aided by devices of invention as outlined by classic theorists. Though Blair rejects this traditional method of discourse, his work is still prescriptive in nature.

Blair&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres&quot; combines the fundamental principles of belletristic rhetoric and literary theory in a concise, accessible form. Drawing on classic and modern theories, Blair&#x27;s work is the most comprehensive prescriptive guide on composition in the 18th century. It enjoyed tremendous success for nearly a century, as 130 editions were published in numerous European languages. This work proved a best seller in Europe, for instance in Italy went through at least a dozen different editions, but the best remains that by Giambattista Bodoni in 1801. It was known in Italy as &quot;Ugone Blair&quot;.

==Influence==
Blair wrote in a time when print culture was flourishing and traditional rhetoric was falling out of favour. By focusing on issues of cultivation and upward mobility, Blair overshadowed the prevailing opinions of rhetoric and capitalised on the 18th century belief in the potential to rise above one&#x27;s station. At this time, new money industrialists and merchants caused the middle class to rise and the English empire to grow. Blair&#x27;s optimistic view that upward mobility could be affected by an understanding of eloquence and refined literature fit perfectly with the mentality of the time. In particular, the ideas presented in &quot;Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres&quot; were adapted in many prestigious institutions of learning and served as the guide on composition for many years. The &quot;Lectures&quot; were predominantly popular in the United States, with colleges such as Yale and Harvard implementing Blair&#x27;s theories.

After the authenticity of the Ossian poems was disproved, &quot;A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian&quot; caused a decline in Blair&#x27;s credibility. &quot;Sermons&quot; was criticised for its sentimentality and lack of doctrinal definiteness and it failed to adapt to changing tastes. &quot;Lectures&quot; too did not maintain its popularity as theorists such as Whately and Spencer, drawing on Blair&#x27;s theories, dominated the domain of composition theory.

A portrait of Blair&#x27;s Spanish translator, José Luis Munárriz, painted in 1815 by Goya, hangs in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. Munárriz holds one of Blair&#x27;s books in his hands.

<text>The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is a professional association of industrial hygienists and practitioners of related professions, with headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. One of its goals is to advance worker protection by providing timely, objective, scientific information to occupational and environmental health professionals.

== History ==

The National Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (NCGIH) convened on June 27, 1938, in Washington, D.C. NCGIH&#x27;s original constitution limited full membership to two representatives from each governmental industrial hygiene agency. Associate membership was made available to other professional personnel of the agencies holding full memberships, and also to personnel of educational institutions engaged in teaching industrial hygiene. Governmental industrial hygiene personnel of other countries were eligible for affiliated membership.

The Conference came into being with 59 members, one affiliated member, and 16 associate members. Forty-three members, one associate and six guests, attended the initial Conference. All but five of the members were from health departments. The New York and Massachusetts state labor departments each had two present, and one from the West Virginia state compensation commission.

At the end of World War II, many individuals were leaving governmental employment and membership in the Conference declined from the peak of 281 in 1944 to 235 in 1946. Changes due to the transition to a peacetime economy, the development of other professional associations, and changes in the technical and administrative needs of state and local agencies, required the Conference to revise its constitution and make some major changes in its organizational structure.

The 1946 constitution revisions abandoned the concept of limiting full membership to only two individuals from each governmental industrial hygiene agency. This opened the doors to all of their professional personnel to participate in the activities of the organization on an equal basis. Governmental industrial hygiene personnel from foreign countries were also given the right to full membership. These changes, among others, were to have a salutary effect on the organization which, in 1946, changed its name to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH).

In the mid-1950s, steady growth in membership resumed and by 1960 there were 511 members, including 54 from other countries. During the next decade these numbers more than doubled and in 1977 the total reached 1,800, of which 166 were from outside the United States.

For over 75 years, ACGIH has been dedicated to the industrial hygiene and occupational and environmental health and safety communities. They have grown and expanded without losing sight of their original goal - to encourage the interchange of experience among industrial hygiene workers and to collect and make accessible such information and data as might be of aid to them in the proper fulfillment of their duties. This original goal is reflected in both their current mission - the advancement of occupational and environmental health - and in their tagline: Defining the Science of Occupational and Environmental Health.

This scientific information is provided to members and others in the industry through our journal, professional conferences and seminars, as well as through a vast list of technical and scientific publications, including the &quot;TLVs and BEIs &quot; book.

Presently, nine ACGIH committees focus their energies on a range of topics: agricultural safety and health, air sampling instruments, bioaerosols, biological exposure indices, industrial ventilation, international, small business, chemical substance TLVs, and physical agent TLVs.

==Publications==

The &quot;Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene&quot; journal, was published from 1990 through 2003 and was formerly published as &quot;Applied Industrial Hygiene&quot; from 1986 through 1989. This ACGIH peer-reviewed journal provided scientific information and data to members until ACGIH and AIHA began publishing a joint journal.

The &quot;Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene&quot; (JOEH) is a joint publication of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) and ACGIH. JOEH is a peer-reviewed journal devoted to enhancing the knowledge and practice of occupational and environmental hygiene and safety by widely disseminating research articles and applied studies of the highest quality.

Published monthly, JOEH provides a written medium for the communication of ideas, methods, processes, and research in the areas of occupational, industrial, and environmental hygiene; exposure assessment; engineering controls; occupational and environmental epidemiology, medicine and toxicology; ergonomics; and other related disciplines.

== Committees ==

The activities of each Committee are directed by an individual mission statement.

Agricultural Safety &amp; Health Committee

Mission - To promote those activities and programs necessary to our suited for agriculture or agro-business and to increase awareness of occupational health, safety, and environmental issues affecting this underserved population worldwide.

Air Sampling Instruments Committee

Mission - To report on the availability, efficiency, use, and limitations of existing and new sampling methodology and instrumentation.

Bioaerosols Committee

Mission - To compile and disseminate information on biologically derived contaminants that may become airborne, to develop recommendations for assessment, control, remediation, and prevention of such hazards, and to establish criteria for bioaerosol exposure limits.

Biological Exposure Indices Committee

Mission - To develop occupational biological exposure guidelines that are scientifically valid and supported by professional judgment, up-to-date, well-documented, understandable, clear, and produced by a clearly defined process that is balanced and free of conflict of interest.

Industrial Ventilation

Mission - To provide a safe and healthful environment by integrating state-of-the-art information from government and industry sources, using them to develop and recommend ventilation and other engineering controls to capture, collect, filter, and remove airborne contaminants from the workplace.

International Committee

Mission - To help develop and support ACGIH&#x27;s international initiatives.

Small Business Committee

Mission - To develop and disseminate practical information that operators of small businesses and their employees can apply to the recognition, evaluation, and control of workplace hazards and to assist education safety and health professionals in working with small business concerns.

Threshold Limit Values for Chemicals Substances Committee

Mission - To recommend airborne concentrations of agents and exposure conditions for use in the practice of industrial hygiene and by other qualified professionals to protect worker health.

Threshold Limit Values for Physical Agents Committee

Mission - To develop and disseminate occupational exposure guidelines that are evidence-based, scientifically valid, and rigorously review.

== TLVs and BEIs ==

ACGIH establishes the Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for chemical substances, physical agents, and Biological Exposure Indices (BEIs); which refer to the airborne concentrations of chemical substances that workers can be safely exposed to over their working lifetime. They are divided into four categories: time-weighted average (TWA), short-term exposure limit (STEL), surface limit (SL), and ceiling (C).

The Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances (TLV-CS) Committee was established in 1941. This group was charged with investigating, recommending, and annually reviewing exposure limits for chemical substances. It became a standing committee in 1944. Two years later, the organization adopted its first list of 148 exposure limits, then referred to as Maximum Allowable Concentrations. The term &quot;Threshold Limit Values (TLV) was introduced in 1956. The first list of Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices (the &quot;TLVs and BEIs&quot; book) was published in 1962&quot;.&quot; A new edition is now published annually. Today&#x27;s list of TLVs and BEIs includes over 600 chemical substances and physical agents, as well as over 30 Biological Exposure Indices for selected chemicals.

The TLVs and BEIs are developed as guidelines to assist in the control of health hazards. These recommendations or guidelines are intended for use in the practice of industrial hygiene, to be interpreted and applied only by a person trained in this discipline. While not enforceable like OSHA&#x27;s &quot;permissible limit exposures&quot;, TLVs and BEIs are still significant and act as advisory numbers to OSHA and to manufacturers who care about workplace safety.

In certain circumstances, individuals or organizations may wish to make use of these recommendations or guidelines if the use of TLVs and BEIs contributes to the overall improvement in worker protection.

== Foundation for Occupational Health &amp; Safety ==

The Foundation for Occupational Health &amp; Safety (FOHS) is an ACGIH supported nonprofit that promotes workplace and worker well-being worldwide through professional education, scientific research in the field and on the profession itself, and the creation of the Sustainable TLV/BEI Fund.

In 2003, the YIHWAG Family Foundation awarded FOHS a substantial grant to benefit the needs of educational organizations in developing countries throughout the world. From this grant, FOHS established the Worldwide Outreach Program. Its mission is to support the professional development of occupational health and safety throughout the world.

<text>The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste is the fourth studio album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released on November 14, 1989, by Sire Records. The music took a more hardcore, aggressively guitar-driven direction, with Jourgensen inspired by Stormtroopers of Death and Rigor Mortis to add thrash metal guitars to the album and subsequent Ministry releases. As with most of Ministry&#x27;s work, the album&#x27;s lyrics deal mainly with political corruption, cultural violence, environmental degradation, nuclear war, drug addiction, and insanity.

== Background ==
Jourgensen recalled the band&#x27;s state as dysfunctional and the album&#x27;s production as &quot;complete chaos and mayhem&quot;, which gave the band a level of artistic freedom impossible had they planned it. Jourgensen says that despite being a fan favorite, it is not among his favorites because of the condition he was in at the time; he was heavily into drugs during recording and had a poor relationship with his bandmates. In one instance, he chased bassist Paul Barker around the studio with a chair and hit him on the head with it because he &quot;couldn&#x27;t stand him anymore&quot;. Jourgensen credited the era, the city, and the atmosphere at Chicago Trax Studios for the album. Bill Rieflin and Chris Connelly instead attributed the album&#x27;s sound to the band&#x27;s interest in technology.

For pre-production, Rieflin said he and Barker watched films for a month, sampling anything that caught their interest. Instead of writing music, they all improvised individually, rarely collaborating with each other. Connelly compared it to exquisite corpse, a Surrealist technique in which an artistic work is created collaboratively without any of the participants having knowledge of the others&#x27; contribution. Rieflin cited &quot;So What&quot; as the only track to feature two musicians in the studio at the same time.

After playing with the band on &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot;″s tour, Dave Ogilvie collaborated on this album. The New York-based rapper K-Lite sang vocals on &quot;Test&quot;. Jourgensen said that Ministry and K-Lite had been recording songs at the same time at the studio. Both Jourgensen and K-Lite were impressed with the aggressiveness of each other&#x27;s music, and Jourgensen invited him to contribute vocals for a track. Rieflin had previously recorded drums and bass after he became frustrated waiting for the others to contribute music to the track; Barker said he thinks that Rieflin played all the instruments on the song.

The female spoken word part of &quot;Dream Song&quot; is a recorded conversation with Angelina Lukacin, Jourgensen&#x27;s future, and now ex-, wife. Jourgensen had met her while on tour in Canada and, impressed with her entertaining personality, called her on the phone several times while working on the album. Jourgensen recalled the conversations as her &quot;babbling about dreams and angels&quot; while high. Lukacin herself said &quot;Dream Song&quot; was a poem she wrote after having a dream about an angel. She did not know she was being recorded but enjoyed the song.

== Album title and art ==
The title of the album is a reference to the UNCF&#x27;s slogan, &quot;A mind is a terrible thing to waste&quot;. Jourgensen was further inspired by the &quot;Just Say No&quot; anti-drug campaign. Rieflin said the other band members groaned when they heard it, but Jourgensen had the final say in naming. According to Connelly, the album art was inspired by a television program Jourgensen saw where migraine sufferers painted images of their pain. The image itself was a picture of an x-ray from a studio receptionist&#x27;s mother, who had been in a car accident and received a metal plate. Jourgensen said he wanted that as the album artwork as soon as he found out about it, but the other band members disliked it. Barker praised the concept but said the execution was poor.

== Release ==
The album peaked at #163 in the US and was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales in excess of 500,000 units in December 1995. &quot;Burning Inside&quot; reached #23 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Modern Rock Tracks.

== Reception ==
Music critic Tom Moon included the album in his book &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the great works of industrial music&quot; and an influential album that is &quot;way ahead of its time&quot;. In rating it 4.5/5 stars, AllMusic reviewer Marc van der Pol described it as a &quot;wonderful album&quot; that avoids the clichés common to industrial rock. Bill Wyman of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; rated it 3/4 stars and called it Ministry&#x27;s &quot;best-sounding, most assured and consistent album&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, though praising the album&#x27;s other tracks, described &quot;Test&quot; as &quot;a novelty genre exercise from which &quot;Mind&quot; barely recovers&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; also wrote about &quot;So What&quot;, including it on a list of the best songs written from the point of view of a crazy person. They called it &quot;the most obvious and best-executed&quot; of Ministry&#x27;s songs about violent psychosis.

<text>The Polish hip hop scene started in the early 1990s, due to the popularity of American rap. Nevertheless, rap style in Polish music has its deep roots in the 1980s Polish punk rock, alternative rock, disco and funk music.

Polish hip-hop artists are well-known performers across Europe, especially in the former Eastern Bloc. Many rappers from Poland have collaborated with artists from Europe, the US and even Cuba.

==History==
The first album by a Polish performer was &quot;East on the Mic&quot; by PM Cool Lee, which featured two songs in Polish. Lee was from Kielce, but Warsaw soon emerged as a center for hip hop, after KOLOR, a radio station, began broadcasting &quot;Kolor Shock&quot;, hosted by Bogna Świątkowska, Paul Jackson, an African American expatriate, Sylvia Opoku from London, and DJ Volt, whose crew, 1kHz, became performing stars in their own right in 1995. Volt also founded the first Polish independent hip hop label, B.E.A.T. Records. Although the label did not last long, it did introduce groups like Trzyha and Molesta. In Poznań, PH Kopalnia&#x27;s &quot;Polski Rap - Zakazane Piosenki&quot; (&quot;Polish rap - Forbidden Songs&quot;).
Now known as &quot;Liroy&quot;, the former PM Cool Lee released &quot;Alboom&quot; in 1995, which included the hit &quot;Scyzoryk&quot; (&quot;Penknife&quot;).

The most recognizable Polish hip hop band abroad is probably Kaliber 44 which is definitely the most popular hip-hop band in Poland. This band was the first Polish music band to give concerts in the USA, including in Shicago and New York. One of the members AbradAb achieved numerous successes after the group&#x27;s suspension, winning 4 Fryderyk Awards and being nominated for MTV Europe Music Awards.

==Hardcore psycho-rap==

Hardcore psycho-rap (or simply psycho-rap) is a subgenre of rap music, created in the 1990s by the Polish rap group Kaliber 44. This subgenre is characterized by a lot of psychedelia in the lyrics, productions and the atmosphere itself. Psycho-rap lyrics are sung in a loud tone, sometimes even shouted, which is intended to convey emotions more effectively to the human mind. There are often atmospheric additions in the form of women&#x27;s howling or a choir. Polish romanticism and fantasy literature were a strong inspiration for the lyrical layer of psycho-rap. A big stigma in the subgenre, marijuana use also has an impact.

<text>Fisher Ames (; April 9, 1758 – July 4, 1808) was a Representative in the United States Congress from the 1st Congressional District of Massachusetts. He was an important leader of the Federalist Party in the House, and was noted for his oratorical skill.

==Personal life==
Ames was born in Dedham in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. His father, Nathaniel Ames, died when Fisher was but six years old, but his mother, Deborah Fisher, resolved, in spite of her limited income, to give the boy a classical education. He belonged to one of the oldest families in Massachusetts and in his line of his ancestry was William Ames. At the age of six he began the study of Latin, and at the age of twelve, he was sent to Harvard College, graduating in 1774 when he began work as a teacher. While teaching school Ames also studied law in the office of William Tudor. He was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Dedham in 1781.

He had a brother, also named Nathaniel Ames. The brothers had opposite political views and social styles. Nathaniel &quot;enjoyed his role as country doctor, servant of the proletariat, and champion of the common man.&quot; He became the leader of the Democratic-Republican Party in Dedham. He was most at home around the farmers and laborers with whom he grew up. Fisher, on the other hand, liked to dress well, hobnob with Boston society, and was an influential Federalist. Fisher operated his law practice out of the first floor of the Ames Tavern.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1793. Ames had six children, including John, Seth, and William with his wife, Frances. Ames owned a farm on Federal Hill in Dedham that he rented out. If the weather was fair while he was home from Washington, he would walk to the farm every day to inspect the crops growing there.

==Political career==
===Massachusetts===

In 1788, he became a member of the Massachusetts convention that ratified the United States Constitution. His &quot;lucid and persuasive&quot; speeches in the convention helped to sway enough votes to adopt the Constitution. Later that year, he was elected to serve in the Massachusetts House of Representatives alongside Nathaniel Kingsbury.

After stepping down from Congress, he stayed in politics and was a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council from 1798 to 1800. In his new role, Ames offered one of the great orations on the death of President Washington.

===Federal===
Ames was elected to the First United States Congress, having beaten Samuel Adams for the post. He was surprised by his win. He was a member of the Federalist Party, specifically its Essex Junto. James Madison wrote to Thomas Jefferson in 1794 that &quot;Ames is said to owe his success to the votes of negroes and British sailors smuggled under a very lax mode of conducting the election there.&quot;

Ames also served in the Second and Third Congresses and as a Federalist to the Fourth Congress. He served in Congress from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1797. During the First Congress, he was chairman of the Committee on Elections. In 1796, he was not a candidate for renomination but resumed the practice of law in Dedham.

Though he was young, he was considered one of the best orators in the Congress. Ames offered one of the first great speeches in American Congressional history when he spoke in favor of the Jay Treaty. Ames vigorously defended the interests of New England, such as opposing a tax on molasses. Despite his Federalist sympathies, Ames would dissent from his party when he felt it was not in the country&#x27;s best interest. For example, in 1789 Ames argued against the appointment of Thomas Willing as the President of Hamilton&#x27;s newly created Bank of the United States.

In 1794, the people of Charleston, South Carolina burned him in effigy alongside William Pitt, Benedict Arnold, and the Devil for his pro-British positions.

===Political opinions===
Ames became concerned by the rising popularity of Jefferson&#x27;s Republicans, who advocated the United States adopt Republican type representative government along the lines of post-Revolution government in France. Hamilton&#x27;s Federalists (of which Ames was one), although they too agreed with a Republic, advocated a stronger federal government with similar powers to the British example. Ames felt Federalism around a clear and firm constitution was the model the United States should follow to prevent the fledgling nation from failing. He cautioned against the excesses of democracy unfettered by morals and reason: &quot;Popular reason does not always know how to act right, nor does it always act right when it knows.&quot; He also felt that democracy alone was too fragile a system to resist descent into tyranny. &quot;A democracy cannot last. Its nature ordains that its next change should be into a military despotism...The reason is that the tyranny of what is called the people, and that by the sword, both operate alike to debase and corrupt, til there are neither men left with the spirit to desire liberty, nor morals with the power to sustain justice. Like the burning pestilence that destroys the human body, nothing can subsist by its dissolution but vermin.&quot; Likewise, Ames warned his countrymen of the dangers of flattering demagogues, who incite dis-union and lead their country into bondage:
&quot;Our country is too big for union, too sordid for patriotism, too democratic for liberty. What is to become of it, He who made it best knows. Its vice will govern it, by practising upon its folly. This is ordained for democracies.&quot;

===Views on slavery===
Ames was outspokenly opposed to slavery, as were both of his parents. Ames supported the abolition of slavery in Massachusetts in the early 1780s, and advocated all newly independent states outlaw slavery in the aftermath of the American Revolution. He was a personal acquaintance of Bunker Hill veterans Peter Salem and Salem Poor, which may have influenced his antislavery views as well.

==Later years==
In the late 18th century, Massachusetts was a solidly Federalist state. Dedham, however, was divided between Federalists and Republicans.

Ames returned home to Dedham in 1797. Upon returning, he was alarmed by the growing number of Republicans in town, led by his brother Nathaniel, who lived next door. In 1798, he hosted a Fourth of July party for 60 residents that was complete with patriotic songs and speeches. The attendees wrote a complimentary letter to President John Adams, pledging their support should the new nation go to war with France. Referring to the XYZ Affair, they wanted France to know that &quot;we bear no foreign yoke--we will pay no tribute.&quot;

Nathaniel Ames wrote in his diary that his brother had convinced &quot;a few deluded people&quot; into signing the letter by &quot;squeezing teazing greazing&quot; them with food and drink. Despite his brother the Congressman&#x27;s efforts, Nathaniel believed that &quot;the Great Mass of People&quot; in the town were with the Republicans. For his part, Fisher wrote to Secretary of State Timothy Pickering after the party that &quot;the progress of right opinions&quot; was winning out in Dedham over &quot;perhaps the most malevolent spirit that exists,&quot; the Republican Party. Members of the Federalist elite continued to visit him at his Dedham home, including Alexander Hamilton on June 24, 1800.

Ames supported calling Joshua Bates as minister of the First Church and Parish in Dedham, but later left that church and became an Episcopalian.

While attending a Town Meeting in Dedham, he rose to speak and delivered one of his &quot;oratorical gems.&quot; A laborer rose to speak after him and said &quot;Mr. Moderator, my brother Ames&#x27; eloquence reminds me of nothing but the shining of a firefly, which gives just enough light to show its own insignificance.&quot; He then immediately sat down.

In 1805, Ames was chosen president of Harvard University. He declined to serve because of failing health. Ames died on July 4, 1808. Nathaniel had arragned for a funeral in Dedham and had sent details to a printer to be published. George Cabot sent an employee to speak to Ames&#x27; widow about hosting the funeral in his home. The widow agreed. Nathaniel believed Cabot&#x27;s intentions were to embarrass the Town of Dedham for its Republican political views and did not attend. Ames was interred in the Old Village Cemetery.

==Legacy==
He is the namesake of Ames Christian University. The Ames Schoolhouse, now Dedham&#x27;s Town Hall, was named for him.

Despite his limited number of years in public service, Fisher Ames ranks as one of the more influential figures of his era. Ames led Federalist ranks in the House of Representatives. His acceptance of the Bill of Rights garnered support in Massachusetts for the new Constitution. His greatest fame however may have come as an orator, for which one historian has dubbed him &quot;the most eloquent of the Federalists.&quot;

==Writings==

Ames got his start in politics by writing essays in the local press under the pen names of Camillus and Lucius Junius Brutus. doing so gave him a level of notoriety beyond the confines of Dedham. He also published a number of essays, critical of Jefferson&#x27;s followers.

<doc id="225957" wikidata="Q3938268" url="?curid=225957" title="Robert Ferguson (minister)">
<text>Robert Ferguson (c. 1637–1714) was a Scottish presbyterian minister, conspirator and political pamphleteer, known as &quot;the Plotter&quot;.

==Ancestry==
He was the eldest son of William Ferguson (d. 1699) of Badifurrow, Aberdeenshire, Scotland and Janet Black. His father disinherited him so the lands of Badifurrow passed to Ferguson&#x27;s younger brother William, who pre-deceased William senior, so the lands were inherited by James Ferguson who immediately sold the estate and purchased Pitfour.
Another younger brother was Major General James Ferguson.

==Life==

After receiving a good education, probably at the University of Aberdeen, became a Presbyterian (Church of Scotland) minister.

According to Bishop Burnet he was cast out by the Presbyterians, but whether this be so or not, he soon made his way to England and became vicar of Godmersham, Kent, from which living he was expelled by the Act of Uniformity 1662.

Some years later, having gained a reputation as a theological controversialist and become a person of importance among the Nonconformists, he attracted the notice of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury and the party which favoured the exclusion of the Duke of York from the throne, and he began to write political pamphlets just at the time when the feeling against the Roman Catholics was at its height. In 1680 he wrote &quot;A Letter to a Person of Honour concerning the &#x27;Black Box,&#x27;&quot; in which he supported the claim of the Duke of Monmouth to the crown against that of the Duke of York [there was said to be a black box that contained a marriage contract between Charles II and Lucy Walter]. Returning to the subject after Charles II had solemnly denied the existence of a marriage between himself and Lucy Walter.

He took an active part in the controversy over the Exclusion Bill, and claimed to be the author of the whole of the pamphlet &quot;No Protestant Plot&quot; (1681), parts of which are usually ascribed to Shaftesbury. Ferguson was deeply implicated in the Rye House Plot, although he asserted that he had frustrated both this and a subsequent attempt to assassinate the king, and he fled to the Netherlands with Shaftesbury in 1682, returning to England early in 1683.

For his share in another plot against Charles II he was declared an outlaw, after which he entered into communication with Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll, Monmouth and other malcontents. Ferguson then took a leading part in organizing the rising of 1685. Having overcome Monmouth&#x27;s reluctance to take part in this movement, he accompanied the duke to the west of England and drew up the manifesto against James II, escaping to the Netherlands after the Battle of Sedgemoor. He landed in England with William III of Orange in 1688, and aided William&#x27;s cause with his pen, but William and his advisers did not regard him as a person of importance, although his services were rewarded with a sinecure appointment in the Excise.

Chagrined at this treatment, Ferguson was soon in correspondence with the exiled Jacobites. He shared in all the plots against the life of William, and after his removal from the Excise in 1692 wrote violent pamphlets against the government. Although he was several times arrested on suspicion, he was never brought to trial. He died in great poverty, leaving behind him a great and deserved reputation for treachery.

It has been thought by Macaulay and others that Ferguson led the English government to believe that he was a spy in their interests, and that his frequent escapes from justice were due to official connivance. In a proclamation issued for his arrest in 1683 he is described as &quot;a tall lean man, dark brown hair, a great Roman nose, thin-jawed, heat in his face, speaks in the Scottish accent, a sharp piercing eye, stoops a little in the shoulders.&quot;

==Works==
Besides numerous pamphlets, Ferguson wrote: &quot;No Protestant-plot; or, the present pretended conspiracy of Protestants against the king and government, discovered to be a conspiracy of the Papists against the king and his Protestant-subjects&quot; (1682), &quot;History of the Revolution&quot; (1706); &quot;Qualifications requisite in a Minister of State&quot; (1710); and part of the &quot;History of all the Mobs, Tumults and Insurrections in Great Britain&quot; (London, 1715).

<text>In statistics, the percentile rank (PR) of a given score is the percentage of scores in its frequency distribution that are less than that score.

==Formulation==
Its mathematical formula is

: formula_1

where &quot;CF&quot;—the cumulative frequency—is the count of all scores less than or equal to the score of interest, &quot;F&quot; is the frequency for the score of interest, and &quot;N&quot; is the number of scores in the distribution. Alternatively, if &quot;CF″&quot; is the count of all scores less than the score of interest, then

: formula_2

==Example==
The figure illustrates the percentile rank computation and shows how the 0.5 × &quot;F&quot; term in the formula ensures that the percentile rank reflects a percentage of scores less than the specified score. For example, for the 10 scores shown in the figure, 60% of them are below a score of 4 (five less than 4 and half of the two equal to 4) and 95% are below 7 (nine less than 7 and half of the one equal to 7). Occasionally the percentile rank of a score is mistakenly defined as the percentage of scores lower than or equal to it, but that would require a different computation, one with the 0.5 × &quot;F&quot; term deleted. Typically percentile ranks are only computed for scores in the distribution but, as the figure illustrates, percentile ranks can also be computed for scores whose frequency is zero. For example, 90% of the scores are less than 6 (nine less than 6, none equal 6).

==Usage==
In educational measurement, a range of percentile ranks, often appearing on a score report, shows the range within which the test taker&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; percentile rank probably occurs. The &quot;true&quot; value refers to the rank the test taker would obtain if there were no random errors involved in the testing process.

Percentile ranks are commonly used to clarify the interpretation of scores on standardized tests. For the test theory, the percentile rank of a raw score is interpreted as the percentage of examinees in the norm group who scored below the score of interest.

==Caveats==
Percentile ranks are not on an equal-interval scale; that is, the difference between any two scores is not the same as between any other two scores whose difference in percentile ranks is the same. For example, is not the same distance as because of the bell-curve shape of the distribution. Some percentile ranks are closer to some than others. Percentile rank 30 is closer on the bell curve to 40 than it is to 20. If the distribution is normally distributed, the percentile rank can be inferred from the standard score.

<text>Rev John Home (2 September 1722 – 4 September 1808) was a Scottish minister, soldier and author. His play &quot;Douglas&quot; was a standard Scottish school text until the Second World War, but his work is now largely neglected. In 1783, he was one of the joint founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

==Biography==
He was born on 2 September 1722 in Leith near Edinburgh, and christened on 3 September 1722. His father, Alexander Home, a distant relation of the earls of Home, was town clerk. His mother was Christian Hay, the daughter of an Edinburgh lawyer.

John was educated at the Leith Grammar School, and at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MA in 1742. Though interested in being a soldier, he studied divinity, and was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Edinburgh in 1745. In the same year he joined as a volunteer against Bonnie Prince Charlie, and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Falkirk. With many others he was carried to Doune Castle in Perthshire, but soon escaped, reaching Alloa on foot, from where they got passage on the sloop-of-war &quot;Vulture&quot; to Queensferry. From there he reached his father&#x27;s house in Leith.

In July 1746, Home was presented to the parish of Athelstaneford in East Lothian, which had been left vacant by the death of Robert Blair. 
In his spare time he visited his friends in Edinburgh and became especially close to David Hume who was a distant cousin. Other friends included Adam Smith, Adam Fergusson and William Robertson.

Home&#x27;s first play, &quot;Agis&quot;, founded on Plutarch&#x27;s narrative, was completed in 1747. He took it to London, England, and submitted it to David Garrick for representation at Drury Lane, but it was rejected as unsuitable for the stage. 
The tragedy of &quot;Douglas&quot; was suggested to him by hearing a lady sing the ballad of &quot;Gil Morrice&quot; or &quot;Child Maurice&quot; (Francis James Child, &quot;Popular Ballads&quot;, ii. 263). 
The ballad supplied him with the outline of a simple and striking plot.

After five years, he completed his play and took it to London for Garrick&#x27;s opinion. 
It was rejected, but on his return to Edinburgh his friends resolved that it should be produced there. 
It was performed on 14 December 1756 with overwhelming success, in spite of the opposition of the presbytery, who summoned Alexander Carlyle to answer for having attended its representation. 
Home resigned his charge in 1757, after a visit to London, where &quot;Douglas&quot; was brought out at Covent Garden on 14 March. Peg Woffington played Lady Randolph, a part which found a later exponent in Sarah Siddons. Hume summed up his admiration for &quot;Douglas&quot; by saying that his friend possessed &quot;the true theatric genius of Shakespeare and Otway, refined from the unhappy barbarism of the one and licentiousness of the other.&quot; Gray, writing to Horace Walpole (August 1757), said that the author &quot;seemed to have retrieved the true language of the stage, which has been lost for these hundred years,&quot; but Samuel Johnson held aloof from the general enthusiasm, and averred that there were not ten good lines in the whole play.

In 1758, Home became private secretary to Lord Bute, then secretary of state, and was appointed tutor to the prince of Wales; and in 1760 his patron&#x27;s influence procured him a pension of £300 per annum and in 1763 a sinecure worth another £500. Garrick produced &quot;Agis&quot; at Drury Lane on 21 February 1758. By dint of good acting and powerful support, according to Genest, the play lasted for eleven days, but it was lamentably inferior to &quot;Douglas&quot;. In 1760 his tragedy, &quot;The Siege of Aquileia&quot;, was put on the stage, Garrick taking the part of Aemilius. In 1769 another tragedy, &quot;The Fatal Discovery&quot; ran for nine nights; &quot;Alonzo&quot; (1773) also had fair success; but his last tragedy, &quot;Alfred&quot; (1778), was so coolly received that he gave up writing for the stage. 
Home was also an active participant in the social life of Edinburgh, and joined the Poker Club in 1762.

In May 1763 he succeeded George Lind as MP for Edinburgh.

On 15 July 1770, he married Mary Home (died 1816)(his second cousin, once removed). Mary was the daughter of the Reverend William Home (c1706-1784), minister of firstly Polwarth, then secondly Fogo. They had no children.

In 1778, he joined a regiment formed by the Duke of Buccleuch. He sustained severe injuries in a fall from horseback which permanently affected his brain, and was persuaded by his friends to retire. 
From 1767, he resided either at Edinburgh or at a villa which he built at Kilduff near his former parish. 
It was at this time that he wrote his &quot;History of the Rebellion of 1745&quot;, which appeared in 1802. 

Home died at Merchiston Bank, near Edinburgh, in his eighty-sixth year, on 4 September. He was buried on 5 September in South Leith Parish Church.

==Works==

The &quot;Works of John Home&quot; were collected and published by Henry Mackenzie in 1822 with &quot;An Account of the Life and Writings of Mr John House,&quot; which also appeared separately in the same year, but several of his smaller poems seem to have escaped the editor&#x27;s observation. These are: &quot;The Fate of Caesar&quot;, &quot;Verses upon Inveraray&quot;, &quot;Epistle to the Earl of Eglintoun&quot;, &quot;Prologue on the Birthday of the Prince of Wales, 1759&quot; and several &quot;Epigrams&quot;, which are printed in vol. ii. of &quot;Original Poems by Scottish Gentlemen&quot; (1762). See also W Scott, &quot;The Life and Works of John Home&quot; in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; (June 1827). &quot;Douglas&quot; is included in numerous collections of British drama. Voltaire published his &#x27; (1760), &quot;Londres&quot; (really Geneva), as a translation from the work of Hume, described as &#x27;, but Home seems to have taken no notice of the mystification.

==Memorials==

Home is amongst the sixteen writers and poets depicted on the lower capital heads of the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh. He appears at the far right side on the east face.

A small bronze plaque stands near the site of his home on Maritime Street in Leith. His house was demolished in the 1950s and now holds a modern housing development (Bell&#x27;s Court).

<text>George William Forbes (; 12 March 1869 – 17 May 1947) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 22nd prime minister of New Zealand from 28 May 1930 to 6 December 1935.

Forbes was born in Lyttelton and later began farming near Christchurch. He became active in local politics. Forbes first entered the House of Representatives in 1908 as a member of the Liberal Party, he became leader in 1925, the leader of the United Party in 1930, and he initially led the newly created National Party in 1936. His rise to power as Prime Minister was unexpected, and some believed him unsuited to the post; it was his misfortune to hold office during the very worst period of the Great Depression. He nevertheless remained in power for five years. Forbes headed the United–Reform coalition Government that eventually became the modern National Party.

Often referred to as &quot;Honest George&quot;, Forbes had a reputation for probity, considerable debating skills, a good memory, and that most essential of skills in a party leader, an ability to assess the mood of the House. His courteous and friendly attitude earned him the liking and respect of parliamentarians from all sides of the House. Throughout his time in national politics his Hurunui constituents held Forbes in high regard: even during his tenure as Prime Minister he would roll up his sleeves and help load sheep from his farm on the railway wagons for market.

==Early life==
Forbes was born in 1869 in Lyttelton, just outside the city of Christchurch. His father was Robert Forbes, a prosperous ships’ chandler and merchant, and his mother was Annie Adamson. He gained his education at Lytteton school and at Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School in Christchurch, and did not attend university. He became known for his ability at sport, particularly in athletics, rowing, and rugby where he captained the Canterbury team in 1892. After finishing school he was employed at a Lyttelton merchant&#x27;s business and then briefly worked in his father&#x27;s ships&#x27; chandlery business in Lyttelton. In 1893, at the age of 24, he drove his spring-cart from Christchurch to Cheviot, North Canterbury, after gaining two adjoining leasehold farming sections in the Cheviot Estate land ballot and he went on to establish himself as a successful farmer on this land that he named Crystal Brook. Initially he lived in a tent on his new land until the first homestead was built. An interest in politics was first stoked after hearing George Grey speak in Lyttelton. His interest was further stoked by George Laurenson, a future Liberal member of parliament and a business partner of his father. He quickly became active in the local politics of the region, particularly as a member of the Mckenzie Domain Board, the Cheviot County Council and the Cheviot Settlers&#x27; Association. He was appointed by Richard Seddon as a Commission member on the 1905 Royal Commission on Crown Lands and with others on the Commission travelled extensively around the country.

Forbes participated in a debating society in Christchurch. He was versed in British political history even though he didn&#x27;t attend university. After his death in 1947, it was noted by Sidney Holland in parliament that the Parliamentary Librarian of the era, Dr. Scholefield, had informed Holland that Forbes was &quot;one of the most widely read men.&quot; Walter Nash was also recorded at the same time paying tribute to the fact that Forbes was a great reader, noting that he had read more biographies and knew more about the political history of New Zealand and Britain than most.

==Entry to Parliament==




At the , Forbes made his first attempt to enter national politics, standing for the electorate. He stood as an independent, having failed to gain the Liberal Party nomination. He lost the election. At the , however, he became the Liberal Party&#x27;s official Hurunui candidate, and won the seat of Hurunui. He would hold this seat for thirty-five years.

Forbes remained a backbencher for some time, but became the Liberal Party&#x27;s Whip when party leader Thomas Mackenzie became prime minister in March 1912. He retained this position when his party went into Opposition on 10 July 1912. However, he had considerably higher status within the party than his official responsibilities indicated, although few thought of him as a potential leader. He became the deputy of Liberal leader Thomas Wilford, and did most of the work running the party administratively.

By the mid-1920s, the Liberal Party faced a decision as to its political future. The Reform Party government of William Massey dominated the political scene, having secured the conservative vote, while the growing Labour Party had started to undermine Liberal&#x27;s progressive voter-base. Many members of the Liberal Party believed an alliance with the Reform Party inevitable, seeing such co-operation as necessary to counteract the &quot;radicalism&quot; of the Labour Party. When Massey died in 1925, Wilford decided to approach Massey&#x27;s successor with a merger-proposal, suggesting that the new party could use the name &quot;the National Party&quot;. The Liberal Party chose Forbes to represent them at a joint conference. The new Reform Party leader, Gordon Coates, rejected the proposal, although Wilford declared that the Liberals would include the name &quot;National&quot; in their party regardless.

==Party leader==

Shortly after the merger proposal was rejected, Wilford resigned as leader, and Forbes unexpectedly became party leader. In the election later that year, however, the party did very badly, gaining only eleven seats compared with Reform&#x27;s fifty-five. To compound the injury, Forbes no longer even held the post of Leader of the Opposition – the Labour Party had won twelve seats, enabling its leader Harry Holland to claim seniority in Opposition, although with two independents sitting in opposition as well the position of Leader of the Opposition remained vacant until Labour won the 1926 Eden by-election.

The party&#x27;s poor fortune did not last long, however. In 1927, Liberal Party politician Bill Veitch secured an alliance with Albert Davy, a former Reform Party organiser who had become dissatisfied with what he saw as Reform&#x27;s paternalism and intrusive governance. The remains of the Liberal Party, still calling itself National, absorbed Davy&#x27;s new &quot;United New Zealand Political Organization&quot;, and adopted the name &quot;the United Party&quot;. Forbes and Veitch both vied as candidates for the leadership of the United Party, but the position eventually went to a former Liberal Party Prime Minister, Sir Joseph Ward. Forbes became one of two deputy leaders, having particular responsibility for the South Island.

Under the United banner, bolstered by Reform Party dissidents, the remnants of the old Liberal Party once again gained traction. In the 1928 election, United unexpectedly won as many seats as Reform, and formed a government with backing from the Labour Party. Forbes gained the portfolios of Lands and Agriculture.

Ward had been in poor health for most of the 1920s, and continued to decline throughout his second tenure as prime minister. By the spring of 1930, Ward could no longer carry out his duties, leaving Forbes as acting prime minister in all but name. In May 1930, Ward finally gave his official resignation, and Forbes succeeded him as United Party leader and prime minister. He also served as his own minister of finance leading financial policy.

==Prime minister==

As Prime Minister, Forbes, was once described by William Downie Stewart Jr as &quot;apathetic and fatalistic&quot;, reacted to events but showed little vision or purpose. At the same time, Downie Stewart acknowledged that Forbes had to do &quot;a rotten job&quot;. Opponents also criticised him for relying too much on the advice of his friends. However, the Great Depression proved a difficult time for many governments around the world, and his defenders claim that he did the best job possible in the circumstances of the economic crisis. Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Lord Bledisloe, the Governor-General from 1930 until 1935, described Forbes to the King&#x27;s then Private Secretary, Lord Stamfordham, as &quot;universally respected by the N.Z. public and by politicians of all shades of opinion. He is a man of always polite speech and agreeable manner and without doubt the most popular member of the House of Representatives.&quot; Forbes became New Zealand’s first Canterbury-born Prime Minister.

During his premiership, Forbes also served as the Minister of External Affairs between 1930 and 1935.

Early into his premiership, Forbes represented New Zealand in London at the 1930 Imperial Conference and, along with fellow Dominion Prime Ministers, dealt with legislative and economic matters affecting Britain and its Dominion countries. Forbes led a strong team and reports of his performance in Britain were positive. Stamfordham wrote to Bledisloe shortly after, telling him, &quot;I should say that among all the Dominion Prime Ministers of the 1930 Imperial Conference, Forbes will be remembered with feelings of appreciation and respect.&quot; Carl Berendsen, who had joined the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department in 1926 as Imperial Affairs Officer and who later became head of that Department and an Ambassador, accompanied Forbes to the London conference and in Berendsen&#x27;s view, &quot;He never pretended to be anything but transparently honest and sincere and he got through the conference with credit. In the countryside and the provincial cities as well as the capital he was well liked.&quot; Confidence in Forbes continued and in early 1931, his long-time friend and cabinet colleague, Sir Apirana Ngata, noted that, &quot;Since he returned from London we have all remarked [on] his confident handling of affairs and homeliness of his manner of stating problems. I suppose the great ones of the Earth have been and are men of a few simple great ideas, whose minds can wrap these round any accumulation of detail.&quot;

The Forbes government began to show signs of instability when the Labour Party withdrew its support. Labour expressed dissatisfaction with a number of the government&#x27;s economic measures – Forbes intended them to reduce the government deficit and to stimulate the economy, but Labour claimed that they unnecessarily harmed the interests of poorer citizens. Forbes had perforce to continue with reluctant support from the Reform Party, which now feared Labour&#x27;s growing popularity.

Forbes took little interest in his ministers&#x27; work and had a very hands-off approach to leadership. He was either unable or unwilling to look beyond the economic orthodoxy of austerity. His policies were uninspiring with budget cuts, minimal wage relief work schemes and civil service pay cuts being implemented. During this time of fiscal restraint by his government, a story was leaked that Forbes indulged in the personal luxury of going to the movie theatre twice a week. However, sources of disinformation about Forbes appear to have occasionally arisen from the office of Gordon Coates and, coincidentally, a story about going to the pictures twice a week was first reported in parliament on 27 September 1932, when Labour member Robert Semple questioned Forbes about an interview given by Gordon Coates to the San Francisco Chronicle. It was Coates who had reportedly told the newspaper that New Zealand city-bred folk were heading to the countryside, where they were provided with houses and taken to the pictures twice a week.

In late 1931, Forbes called for a &quot;grand coalition&quot; of United, Reform, and Labour to resolve the country&#x27;s economic problems. Forbes told a joint conference that he would not implement the measures he deemed necessary without broad backing. Labour refused to join this coalition, but ex-Prime Minister Coates (prompted by the Reform Party&#x27;s finance spokesperson, William Downie Stewart Jr) eventually agreed. In the 1931 election, the United-Reform Coalition performed well, winning a combined total of fifty-one seats. Forbes remained Prime Minister, but surrendered the finance role to Stewart. Slowly, however, many people came to believe that Coates held significantly more influence, and that Forbes showed himself overwilling to give in to Coates&#x27; demands. This view became reinforced when Coates and Stewart argued over financial policy – although Forbes was known to prefer Stewart&#x27;s policy, he publicly sided with Coates, and Stewart resigned.

Coates replaced Stewart as Minister of Finance, and became even more dominant in the coalition. Stewart, noting this, complained that &quot;the Prime Minister is too passive and the Minister of Finance is too active&quot;. Both Forbes and Coates, however, increasingly took the blame for the country&#x27;s ongoing economic problems, and could not avoid the growing public dissatisfaction. Coates&#x27; acquisition of the finance portfolio, coincided with more imaginative approaches taking place. These included a devaluation of the currency to improve export prices, giving mortgage relief for farmers and the creation of the Reserve Bank. Forbes never conceived any such initiatives of his own and was a passive bystander in decision making. Despite these and other later perceptions, in 1930, prior to the United coalition with Reform, Forbes had also been Minister of Finance and, in creating the Reserve Bank, it was Forbes who in July 1930 commissioned Otto Niemeyer of the Bank of England to report on New Zealand establishing a central bank. Later, in December 1932 and prior to Coates becoming Minister of Finance, Forbes introduced the Reserve Bank Bill to the House. Lord Bledisloe became familiar with both Forbes and Coates throughout this difficult period and his view of each man, recorded in his correspondence to the King&#x27;s Private Secretary from 1931, Clive Wigram, was that Forbes, when not suffering from overwork, was patient and phlegmatic and difficult to provoke, whereas Coates was jumpy and indiscreet. Despite Coates’ increased influence in government, Bledisloe’s view of him as contained in his continuing written reports to the King did not improve. In 1932 Bledisloe wrote that Coates was, “thoroughly unstable, insensitive to criticism, imprudently outspoken in public and (I regret to say), disloyal to his colleagues”.

In the election of 1935 the Labour Party defeated the coalition government, gaining fifty-five votes to the coalition&#x27;s nineteen. Forbes was noted for his gracious and sporting concession speech delivered to the country over the radio on the night of the 1935 election.

Forbes was a Privy Counsellor, a Freeman of the City of London and he had the honorary degree of LL.D. conferred on him by the University of Edinburgh and the University of Belfast. In 1935, Forbes was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1937, he was awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal.

==Opposition and Retirement==
By 1935 Forbes had become increasingly weary of politics, writing that he agreed with Stewart&#x27;s description of the profession as &quot;slavery that is miscalled power&quot;. Despite any personal feelings, Forbes remained the only parliamentary party leader between 1925 and 1936 to have consistently called for the formation of the National Party and a formal party fusion between United and Reform was foremost in mind following the 1935 election. Forbes had led the Liberal Party delegation in fusion discussions with Reform in 1925, he had pushed hard for a coalition government with Reform in 1931 and for the fusion of 1935, in the form of the National Political Federation. In February and April 1936, Forbes and others on the Dominion Executive of the National Political Federation agreed to call a conference of members and supporters to form The New Zealand National Party. Of these Dominion Executive members, only Coates stood in opposition once more.

On 4 December 1935, Forbes had been elected Leader of the Parliamentary National Party, he became Leader of the Opposition on 6 December 1935, and from May 1936 led the new National Party (created out of United and Reform) until October 1936 when Adam Hamilton became the party leader. Forbes was also an initial member of the Dominion Council Executive of The New Zealand National Party. The Parliamentary National Party had formally resolved in late August 1936 to reaffirm loyalty to Forbes and had pledged to support him as leader of the Party, but both Party and leader had at the same time also agreed on Forbes&#x27;s tenure as leader of the new National Party until the end of the parliamentary session on 31 October 1936, as Forbes had indicated his desire to withdraw from the limelight, and younger figures in the party saw his past tenure as a political liability.

Forbes retained his parliamentary seat, he was on the Opposition front-bench and served periodically as Deputy Leader of the Opposition until 1943 when he retired after 35 years as a Member of Parliament. His long number of years in the House of Representatives was a record for Canterbury and, with the assistance of Sir Joseph Ward in 1928, he had succeeded in leading the Liberals from their years of decline into the form of the long-living National Party. He declined the offer of the customary knighthood, and four years after his retirement he died at Crystal Brook, his farm near Cheviot. Shortly after, his family declined the government&#x27;s offer of a State Funeral in favour of a ceremony for him at Cheviot.

Following his death, the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, told the House that as a young member, he had &quot;never met any one more kindly or more helpful, or who would give sounder or more friendly advice&quot; than Forbes and, in ending his tribute, Fraser also stated his appreciation of Forbes, &quot;most of all, as a man of sterling character and integrity and as a good friend.&quot; The national memorial for Forbes, the George Forbes Memorial Library, forms part of Lincoln University near Christchurch.

<doc id="225971" wikidata="Q3244907" url="?curid=225971" title="Standardized test">
<text>A standardized test is a test that is administered and scored in a consistent or standard manner. Standardized tests are designed in such a way that the questions and interpretations are consistent and are administered and scored in a predetermined, standard manner.

A standardized test is administered and scored uniformly for all test takers. Any test in which the same test is given in the same manner to all test takers, and graded in the same manner for everyone, is a standardized test. Standardized tests do not need to be high-stakes tests, time-limited tests, multiple-choice tests, academic tests, or tests given to large numbers of test takers. Standardized tests can take various forms, including written, oral, or practical test. The standardized test may evaluate many subjects, including driving, creativity, athleticism, personality, professional ethics, as well as academic skills.

The opposite of standardized testing is non-standardized testing, in which either significantly different tests are given to different test takers, or the same test is assigned under significantly different conditions or evaluated differently.

Most everyday quizzes and tests taken by students during school meet the definition of a standardized test: everyone in the class takes the same test, at the same time, under the same circumstances, and all of the tests are graded by their teacher in the same way. However, the term &quot;standardized test&quot; is most commonly used to refer to tests that are given to larger groups, such as a test taken by all adults who wish to acquire a license to get a particular job, or by all students of a certain age. Most standardized tests are summative assessments (assessments that measure the learning of the participants at the end of an instructional unit).

Because everyone gets the same test and the same grading system, standardized tests are often perceived as being fairer than non-standardized tests. Such tests are often thought of as more objective than a system in which some test takers get an easier test and others get a more difficult test. Standardized tests are designed to permit reliable comparison of outcomes across all test takers because everyone is taking the same test and being graded the same way.

==Definition==

The definition of a standardized test has changed somewhat over time. In 1960, standardized tests were defined as those in which the conditions and content were equal for everyone taking the test, regardless of when, where, or by whom the test was given or graded. Standardized tests have a consistent, uniform method for scoring. This means that all test takers who answer a test question in the same way will get the same score for that question. The purpose of this standardization is to make sure that the scores reliably indicate the abilities or skills being measured, and not other variables.

By the beginning of the 21st century, the focus shifted away from a strict sameness of conditions towards equal fairness of testing conditions. For example, a test taker with a broken wrist might write more slowly because of the injury, and it would be more equitable, and produce a more reliable understanding of the test taker&#x27;s actual knowledge, if that person were given a few more minutes to write down the answers to a time-limited test. Changing the testing conditions in a way that improves fairness with respect to a permanent or temporary disability, but without undermining the main point of the assessment, is called an accommodation.  However, if the accommodation undermines the purpose of the test, then the allowances would become a modification of the content, and no longer a standardized test.

==History==
===China===
The earliest evidence of standardized testing was in China, during the Han dynasty, where the imperial examinations covered the Six Arts which included music, archery, horsemanship, arithmetic, writing, and knowledge of the rituals and ceremonies of both public and private parts. These exams were used to select employees for the state bureaucracy.

Later, sections on military strategies, civil law, revenue and taxation, agriculture and geography were added to the testing. In this form, the examinations were institutionalized for more than a millennium.

Today, standardized testing remains widely used, most notably in the Gaokao system.

===UK===
Standardized testing was introduced into Europe in the early 19th century, modeled on the Chinese mandarin examinations, through the advocacy of British colonial administrators, the most &quot;persistent&quot; of which was Britain&#x27;s consul in Guangzhou, China, Thomas Taylor Meadows. Meadows warned of the collapse of the British Empire if standardized testing was not implemented throughout the empire immediately.

Prior to their adoption, standardized testing was not traditionally a part of Western pedagogy. Based on the skeptical and open-ended tradition of debate inherited from Ancient Greece, Western academia favored non-standardized assessments using essays written by students. Because of this, the first European implementation of standardized testing did not occur in Europe proper, but in British India. Inspired by the Chinese use of standardized testing, in the early 19th century, British company managers used standardized exams for hiring and promotions to keep the process fair and free from corruption or favoritism. This practice of standardized testing was later adopted in the late 19th century in the Britain mainland. The parliamentary debates that ensued made many references to the &quot;Chinese mandarin system&quot;.

Standardized testing spread from Britain not only throughout the British Commonwealth, but to Europe and then America. Its spread was fueled by the Industrial Revolution, where the increase in number of school students as a result of compulsory education laws decreased the use of open-ended assessments, which were harder to mass-produce and assess objectively. 

Standardized tests such as the War Office Selection Boards were developed for the British Army during World War II to choose candidates for officer training and other tasks. The tests looked at soldiers&#x27; mental abilities, mechanical skills, ability to work with others, and other qualities. Previous methods had suffered from bias and resulted in choosing the wrong soldiers for officer training.

===United States===

Standardized testing has been a part of United States education since the 19th century, but the widespread reliance on standardized testing in schools in the US is largely a 20th-century phenomenon.

Immigration in the mid-19th century contributed to the growth of standardized tests in the United States. Standardized tests were used when people first entered the US to test social roles and find social power and status.

The College Entrance Examination Board began offering standardized testing for university and college admission in 1901, covering nine subjects. This test was implemented with the idea of creating standardized admissions for the United States in northeastern elite universities. Originally, the test was also meant for top boarding schools, in order to align the curriculum between schools. Originally the standardized test was made of essays and was not intended for widespread testing.

During World War I, the Army Alpha and Beta tests were developed to help place new recruits in appropriate assignments based upon their assessed intelligence levels. The first edition of a modern standardized test for IQ, the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Test, appeared in 1916. The College Board then designed the SAT (Scholar Aptitude Test) in 1926. The first SAT test was based on the Army IQ tests, with the goal of determining the test taker&#x27;s intelligence, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking. In 1959, Everett Lindquist offered the ACT (American College Testing) for the first time. As of 2020, the ACT includes four main sections with multiple-choice questions to test English, mathematics, reading, and science, plus an optional writing section.

Individual states began testing large numbers of children and teenagers through the public school systems in the 1970s. By the 1980s, American schools were assessing nationally. In 2012, 45 states paid an average of $27 per student, and $669 million overall, on large-scale annual academic tests. However, indirect costs, such as paying teachers to prepare students for the tests and for class time spent administering the tests, significantly exceed the direct cost of the test itself.

The need for the federal government to make meaningful comparisons across a highly de-centralized (locally controlled) public education system encouraged the use of large-scale standardized testing. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 required some standardized testing in public schools. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 further tied some types of public school funding to the results of standardized testing. Under these federal laws, the school curriculum was still set by each state, but the federal government required states to assess how well schools and teachers were teaching the state-chosen material with standardized tests. The results of large-scale standardized tests were used to allocate funds and other resources to schools, and to close poorly performing schools. The Every Student Succeeds Act replaced the NCLB at the end of 2015. By that point, these large-scale standardized tests had become controversial in the United States not necessarily because all the students were taking the same tests and being scored the same way, but because they had become high-stakes tests for the school systems and teachers.

In recent years, many US universities and colleges have abandoned the requirement of standardized test scores by applicants.

=== Australia ===
The Australian National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) standardized testing was commenced in 2008 by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, an independent authority &quot;responsible for the development of a national curriculum, a national assessment program and a national data collection and reporting program that supports 21st century learning for all Australian students&quot;.

The testing includes all students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 in Australian schools to be assessed using national tests. The subjects covered in these tests include Reading, Writing, Language Conventions (Spelling, Grammar and Punctuation) and Numeracy.

The program presents students level reports designed to enable parents to see their child&#x27;s progress over the course of their schooling life, and help teachers to improve individual learning opportunities for their students. Students and school level data are also provided to the appropriate school system on the understanding that they can be used to target specific supports and resources to schools that need them most. Teachers and schools use this information, in conjunction with other information, to determine how well their students are performing and to identify any areas of need requiring assistance.

The concept of testing student achievement is not new, although the current Australian approach may be said to have its origins in current educational policy structures in both the US and the UK. There are several key differences between the Australian NAPLAN and the UK and USA strategies. Schools that are found to be under-performing in the Australian context will be offered financial assistance under the current federal government policy.

===Colombia===
In 1968 the Colombian Institute for the Evaluation of Education (ICFES) was born to regulate higher education. The previous public evaluation system for the authorization of operation and legal recognition for institutions and university programs was implemented.

Colombia has several standardized tests that assess the level of education in the country. These exams are performed by the ICFES.

Students in third grade, fifth grade and ninth grade take the &quot;Saber 3°5°9°&quot; exam. This test is currently presented on a computer in controlled and census samples.

Upon leaving high school students present the &quot;Saber 11&quot; that allows them to enter different universities in the country. Students studying at home can take this exam to graduate from high school and get their degree certificate and diploma.

Students leaving university must take the &quot;Saber Pro&quot; exam.

=== Canada ===

Canada leaves education, and standardized testing as result, under the jurisdiction of the provinces. Each province has its own province-wide standardized testing regime, ranging from no required standardized tests for students in Saskatchewan to exams worth 40% of final high school grades in Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Design and scoring==

=== Design ===
Most commonly, a major academic test includes both human-scored and computer-scored sections.

A standardized test can be composed of multiple-choice questions, true-false questions, essay questions, authentic assessments, or nearly any other form of assessment. Multiple-choice and true-false items are often chosen for tests that are taken by thousands of people because they can be given and scored inexpensively, quickly, and reliably through using special answer sheets that can be read by a computer or via computer-adaptive testing. Some standardized tests have short-answer or essay writing components that are assigned a score by independent evaluators who use rubrics (rules or guidelines) and benchmark papers (examples of papers for each possible score) to determine the grade to be given to a response.

==== Any subject matter ====

Not all standardized tests involve answering questions. An authentic assessment for athletic skills could take the form of running for a set amount of time or dribbling a ball for a certain distance. Healthcare professionals must pass tests proving that they can perform medical procedures. Candidates for driver&#x27;s licenses must pass a standardized test showing that they can drive a car. The Canadian Standardized Test of Fitness has been used in medical research, to determine how physically fit the test takers are.

=== Machine and human scoring ===

Since the latter part of the 20th century, large-scale standardized testing has been shaped in part, by the ease and low cost of grading of multiple-choice tests by computer. Most national and international assessments are not fully evaluated by people.

People are used to score items that are not able to be scored easily by computer (such as essays). For example, the Graduate Record Exam is a computer-adaptive assessment that requires no scoring by people except for the writing portion.

Human scoring is relatively expensive and often variable, which is why computer scoring is preferred when feasible. For example, some critics say that poorly paid employees will score tests badly. Agreement between scorers can vary between 60 and 85 percent, depending on the test and the scoring session. For large-scale tests in schools, some test-givers pay to have two or more scorers read each paper; if their scores do not agree, then the paper is passed to additional scorers.

Though the process is more difficult than grading multiple-choice tests electronically, essays can also be graded by computer. In other instances, essays and other open-ended responses are graded according to a pre-determined assessment rubric by trained graders. For example, at Pearson, all essay graders have four-year university degrees, and a majority are current or former classroom teachers.

=== Use of rubrics for fairness ===
Using a rubric is meant to increase fairness when the test taker&#x27;s performance is evaluated. In standardized testing, measurement error (a consistent pattern of errors and biases in scoring the test) is easy to determine in standardized testing. When the score depends upon the graders&#x27; individual preferences, then test takers&#x27; grades depend upon who grades the test. 

Standardized tests also remove grader bias in assessment. Research shows that teachers create a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in their assessment of test takers, granting those they anticipate will achieve with higher scores and giving those who they expect to fail lower grades. In non-standardized assessment, graders have more individual discretion and therefore are more likely to produce unfair results through unconscious bias. 
===Using scores for comparisons===

There are two types of test score interpretations: a norm-referenced score interpretation or a criterion-referenced score interpretation.

* Norm-referenced score interpretations compare test takers to a sample of peers. The goal is to rank test takers as being better or worse than others. Norm-referenced test score interpretations are associated with traditional education. People who perform better than others pass the test, and people who perform worse than others fail the test.
* Criterion-referenced score interpretations compare test takers to a criterion (a formal definition of content), regardless of the scores of other examinees. These may also be described as standards-based assessments, as they are aligned with the standards-based education reform movement. Criterion-referenced score interpretations are concerned solely with whether or not this particular student&#x27;s answer is correct and complete. Under criterion-referenced systems, it is possible for all test takers to pass the test, or for all test takers to fail the test.

Either of these systems can be used in standardized testing. What is important to standardized testing is whether all students are asked the equivalent questions, under reasonably equal circumstances, and graded according to the same standards. 

A &quot;normative assessment&quot; compares each test taker against other test takers. A norm-referenced test (NRT) is a type of test, assessment, or evaluation which yields an estimate of the position of the tested individual in a predefined population. The estimate is derived from the analysis of test scores and other relevant data from a sample drawn from the population. This type of test identifies whether the test taker performed better or worse than other people taking this test. An IQ test is a norm-referenced standardized test. 

Comparing against others makes norm-referenced standardized tests useful for admissions purposes in higher education, where a school is trying to compare students from across the nation or across the world. The standardization ensures that all of the students are being tested equally, and the norm-referencing identifies which are better or worse. Examples of such international benchmark tests include the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).
A criterion-referenced test (CRT) is a style of test which uses test scores to show how well test takers performed on a given task, not how well they performed compared to other test takers. Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers are criterion-referenced tests. In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the test taker can answer the questions correctly. The test giver is not usually trying to compare each person&#x27;s result against other test takers.

==Standards==
The considerations of validity and reliability typically are viewed as essential elements for determining the quality of any standardized test. However, professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these concerns within broader contexts when developing standards and making overall judgments about the quality of any standardized test as a whole within a given context.

===Evaluation standards===
In the field of psychometrics, the &quot;Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing&quot; place standards about validity and reliability, along with errors of measurement and issues related to the accommodation of individuals with disabilities. The third and final major topic covers standards related to testing applications, credentialing, plus testing in program evaluation and public policy.

In the field of evaluation, and in particular educational evaluation, the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has published three sets of standards for evaluations. &quot;The Personnel Evaluation Standards&quot; was published in 1988, &quot;The Program Evaluation Standards&quot; (2nd edition) was published in 1994, and &quot;The Student Evaluation Standards&quot; was published in 2003.

Each publication presents a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing, and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate. In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. The tests are meant to provide sound, accurate, and credible information about learning and performance; however, most academic tests (standardized or not) offer narrow information of achievement. Relying on a narrow, academic-focused view achievement does not fully represent a person&#x27;s potential for success (e.g., by not testing interpersonal skills or soft skills).

=== Statistical validity ===
One of the main advantages of larger-scale standardized testing is that the results can be empirically documented; therefore, the test scores can be shown to have a relative degree of validity and reliability, as well as results which are generalizable and replicable. This is often contrasted with grades on a school transcript, which are assigned by individual teachers. When looking at individually assigned grades, it may be difficult to account for differences in educational culture across schools, the difficulty of a given teacher&#x27;s assignments, differences in teaching style, the pressure for grade inflation, and other techniques and biases that affect grading.

Another advantage is aggregation. A well-designed standardized test provides an assessment of an individual&#x27;s mastery of a domain of knowledge or skill which at some level of aggregation will provide useful information. That is, while individual assessments may not be accurate enough for practical purposes, the mean scores of classes, schools, branches of a company, or other groups may well provide useful information because of the reduction of error accomplished by increasing the sample size.

==Annual standardized tests at school==
Standardized testing is a very common way of determining a student&#x27;s past academic achievement and future potential. 

The validity, quality, or use of tests, particularly annual standardized tests common in education have continued to be widely both supported or criticized. Like the tests themselves, supports and criticisms of tests are often varied and may come from a variety of sources such as parents, test takers, instructors, business groups, universities, or governmental watchdogs.

Supporters of large-scale standardized tests in education often provide the following reasons for promoting testing in education:

* Feedback or diagnosis of test taker&#x27;s performance: Standardized tests allow teachers to see how their students are performing compared to others in the country. This will help them revise their teaching methods if necessary to help their students meet the standards. Students are given the opportunity to reflect on their scores and see where their strengths as well as weaknesses are. The scores can allow parents to get an idea about how their child is doing academically.
* Fair and efficient. Each test taker will have the same amount of time to complete the test. Every answer and overall grade for a standardized test is evaluated identically, therefore reducing potential bias in the scoring system.
* Promotes accountability: Standardized testing is used as a public policy strategy to establish stronger accountability measures for public education. The idea behind the standardized testing policy movement is that testing is the first step to improving schools, teaching practice, and educational methods through data collection. Proponents argue that the data generated by the standardized tests act like a report card for the community, demonstrating how well local schools are performing. Critics of the movement, however, point to various discrepancies that result from current state standardized testing practices, including problems with test validity and reliability and false correlations (see Simpson&#x27;s paradox).
* Prediction and selection
* Improves performance

Critics of standardized tests in education often provide the following reasons for revising or removing standardized tests in education:

* Poor predictive quality.
* Grade inflation of test scores or grades.
* Culturally or socioeconomically biased.
* Psychologically damaging.
* Poor indicator of intelligence or ability.
Furthermore, student&#x27;s success is being tracked to a teacher&#x27;s relative performance, making teacher advancement contingent upon a teacher&#x27;s success with a student&#x27;s academic performance. Ethical and economical questions arise for teachers when faced with clearly underperforming or under-skilled students and a standardized test.

In her book, &quot;Now You See It&quot;, Cathy Davidson criticizes standardized tests. She describes youth as &quot;assembly line kids on an assembly line model,&quot; meaning the use of the standardized test as a part of a one-size-fits-all educational model. She also criticizes the narrowness of skills being tested and labeling children without these skills as failures or as students with disabilities. Widespread and organized cheating has been a growing culture.

There are three metrics by which the best performing countries in the TIMMS (the &quot;A+ countries&quot;) are measured: focus, coherence, and rigor. Focus is defined as the number of topics covered in each grade; the idea is that the fewer topics covered in each grade, the more focus can be given to each topic. The definition of coherence is adhering to a sequence of topics covered that follows the natural progression or logical structure of mathematics. The CCSSM was compared to both the current state standards and the A+ country standards. With the most topics covered on average, the current state standards had the lowest focus. The Common Core Standards aim to fix this discrepancy by helping educators focus on what students need to learn instead of becoming distracted by extraneous topics. They encourage educational materials to go from covering a vast array of topics in a shallow manner to a few topics in much more depth.

===Time and money===
Standardized tests are a way to measure the education level of students and schools on a broad scale. From Kindergarten to 12th grade, most American students participate in annual standardized tests. The average student takes about 10 of these tests per year (e.g., one or two reading comprehension tests, one or two math tests, a writing test, a science test, etc.). The average amount of testing takes about 2.3% of total class time (equal to about four school days per year).

Standardized tests are expensive to administer. It has been reported that the United States spends about US$1.7 billion annually on these tests. In 2001, it was also reported that only three companies (Harcourt Educational Measurement, CTB McGraw-Hill and Riverside Publishing) design 96% of the tests taken at the state level.

===Educational decisions===

The National Academy of Sciences recommends that major educational decisions not be based solely on a single test score. The use of minimum cut-scores for entrance or graduation does not imply a single standard, since test scores are nearly always combined with other minimal criteria such as number of credits, prerequisite courses, attendance, etc. Test scores are often perceived as the &quot;sole criteria&quot; simply because they are the most difficult, or the fulfillment of other criteria is automatically assumed. One exception to this rule is the GED, which has allowed many people to have their skills recognized even though they did not meet traditional criteria.

Some teachers would argue that a single standardized test only measures a student&#x27;s current knowledge and it does not reflect the students progress from the beginning of the year. A result created by individuals that are not a part of the student&#x27;s regular instruction, but by professionals that determine what students should know at different ages. In addition, teachers agree that the best test creator and facilitator are themselves. They argue that they are the most aware of students abilities, capacities, and necessities which would allow them to take a longer on subjects or proceed on with the regular curriculum.

=== Effects on disadvantaged students ===
Monty Neill, the director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, claims that students who speak English as a second language, who have a disability, or who come from low-income families are disproportionately denied a diploma due to a test score, which is unfair and harmful. In the late 1970s when the graduation test began in the United States, for example, a lawsuit claimed that many Black students had not had a fair opportunity on the material they were tested on the graduation test because they had attended schools segregated by law. &quot;The interaction of under-resourced schools and testing most powerfully hits students of color&quot;, as Neill argues, &quot;They are disproportionately denied diplomas or grade promotion, and the schools they attend are the ones most likely to fare poorly on the tests and face sanctions such as restructuring.&quot;

In the journal &quot;The Progressive,&quot; Barbara Miner explicates the drawbacks of standardized testing by analyzing three different books. As the co-director of the Center for Education at Rice University and a professor of education, Linda M. McNeil in her book &quot;Contradictions of School Reform: Educational Costs of Standardized Testing&quot; writes &quot;Educational standardization harms teaching and learning and, over the long term, re-stratifies education by race and class.&quot; McNeil believes that test-based education reform places higher standards for students of color. According to Miner, McNeil &quot;shows how test-based reform centralizes power in the hands of the corporate and political elite—a particularly frightening development during this time of increasing corporate and conservative influence over education reform.&quot; Such test-based reform has dumbed down learning, especially for students of color.

FairTest says that negative consequences of test misuse include pushing students out of school, driving teachers out of the profession, and undermining student engagement and school climate.

== Use of standardized tests in university admissions==

Standardized tests are reviewed by universities as part of the application, along with other supporting evidence such as personal statements, high school grades, previous coursework, and letters of recommendation. Different countries have different tests, such as the SAT in the US, the Gaokao in China, and the Joint Entrance Examination in India.

Nathan Kuncel, a scholar of higher education, says that college admission tests and other standardized tests &quot;help overwhelmed admissions officers divide enormous numbers of applicants into pools for further assessment. High scores don&#x27;t guarantee admission anywhere, and low scores don&#x27;t rule it out, but schools take the tests seriously.&quot;

Research shows that the tests predict more than just first-year grades and the level of courses a student is likely to take. The longitudinal research conducted by scientists shows that students with high test scores are more likely to take the challenging route through college.

Tests also can indicate the outcomes of students beyond college, including faculty evaluations, research accomplishments, degree attainment, performance on comprehensive exams and professional licensure.

Since grading varies across schools, and even for two students in the same school, the common measure provided by the test score is more useful as a way to compare students.

However, in 1995, the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) scores accounted for just 6 percent of the variation in grades in graduate school. The GRE appeared to be &quot;virtually useless from a prediction standpoint,&quot; wrote the authors. Repeated studies of the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) find the same.

There is debate whether the test will indicate the long-term success in work and life since there are many other factors, but fundamental skills such as reading, writing, and math are related to job performance. Major life accomplishments, such as publishing a novel or patenting technology, are also associated with test scores, even after taking into account educational opportunities. There is even a sizable body of evidence that these skills are related to effective leadership and creative achievements at work. Being able to read texts and make sense of them and having strong quantitative reasoning are crucial in the modern information economy. Students who scored in the top 1% at the age of 13. Twenty years later, they were, on average, very highly accomplished, with high incomes, major awards and career accomplishments.

Many arguments suggest that skills from tests are useful—but only up to a point.

There is a correlation between test scores and social class, but success on standardized tests and in college is not simply dependent on class. The studies show that &quot;the tests were valid even when controlling for socioeconomic class. Regardless of their family background, students with good tests scores and high-school grades do better in college than students with lower scores and weaker transcripts.&quot;

Another criticism relating to social class and standardized testing is that only wealthy people receive test preparation and coaching. However, test prep programs often result in an increase of 5 to 20 points (out of 1600), which is far below the &quot;100 to 200 points claimed by some test prep companies.&quot;

Many people believe that standardized tests reduce diversity in admissions, since disadvantaged members of racial minority groups have, on average, lower test scores than other groups. A 2012 comparison of universities where admissions tests are optional for applicants and schools that use the tests showed that &quot;recent research demonstrates that testing-optional schools have been enrolling increasingly diverse student bodies. But the same is true of schools that require testing.&quot; In 2025, comparisons found that testing-optional admissions disproportionately harmed high-achieving students from lower-income backgrounds.

Opponents claim that standardized tests are misused and uncritical judgments of intelligence and performance, but supporters argue that these aren&#x27;t negatives of standardized tests, but criticisms of poorly designed testing regimes. They argue that testing should and does focus educational resources on the most important aspects of education—imparting a pre-defined set of knowledge and skills—and that other aspects are either less important, or should be added to the testing scheme.

Evidence shows that black and Hispanic students score lower than whites and Asians on average. Therefore, the math and reading standard tests such as SAT have faced escalating attacks from progressives. However, a 2020 report found the tests are not discriminatory and play an important role in protecting educational quality. The report suggested that worsening grade inflation, especially at wealthy high schools, makes a standard assessment especially important.

Regarding UC schools&#x27; intention in dropping standard tests such as the SAT and ACT in college admissions, subjective and customized tests like essays and extra-curriculars can be easily tailored and detrimental to the students who are not familiar with the process. Admissions without testing may be even more tilted in favor of the well-connected.

In January 2020, the faculty senate at the University of California recommended that the UC system keep standardized tests as admissions requirements. The report says standardized math and reading tests are useful for predicting college performance. Based on data from the students in the UC system, the report concludes that &quot;test scores are currently better predictors of first-year GPA than high school grade point average.&quot; The report continues: scores are also good at predicting total college GPA and the possibility a student will graduate. While the &quot;predictive power of test scores has gone up,&quot; the report adds, &quot;the predictive power of high school grades has gone down.&quot;

Test scores enable UC schools &quot;to select those students from underrepresented groups who are more likely to earn higher grades and to graduate on time.&quot; &quot;The original intent of the SAT was to identify students who came from outside relatively privileged circles who might have the potential to succeed in university,&quot; the report says. The SAT&#x27;s maker, the Educational Testing Service (ETS), now claims the SAT is not an &quot;aptitude&quot; test but rather an assessment of &quot;developed abilities&quot;.

== Testing issues not specific to standardization ==
Most tests can be classified on multiple categories. For example, a test can be both standardized and also a high-stakes test, or standardized and also a multiple-choice test. Complaints about &quot;standardized tests&quot; (all test takers take the same test, under reasonably similar conditions, scored the same way) are often focused on concerns unrelated to standardization and apply equally to non-standardized tests. For example, a critic may complain that &quot;the standardized tests are all time-limited tests&quot;, but the focus of the criticism is on the time limit, and not on everyone taking the same test and having their answers graded the same way.

=== High-stakes tests ===
A high-stakes test is a test with a desired reward for good performance. Some standardized tests, including many of the tests used for university admissions around the world, are high-stakes tests. Most standardized tests, such as ordinary classroom quizzes, are low-stakes tests.

Heavy reliance on high-stakes standardized tests for decision-making is often controversial. A common concern with high-stakes tests is that they measure performance during a single event, when critics believe that a more holistic assessment would be appropriate. Critics often propose emphasizing cumulative or even non-numerical measures, such as classroom grades or brief individual assessments (written in prose) from teachers. Supporters argue that test scores provide a clear-cut, objective standard that serves as a valuable check on grade inflation.
=== Norm-referenced tests ===

A norm-referenced test is one that is designed and scored so that some test takers rank better or worse than others. The ranking provides information about the relative ranking, which is helpful when the goal is to determine who is best (e.g., in elite university admissions).

=== Disagreement with educational standards ===
A criterion-referenced test is more common and more practical when the goal is to know whether the test takers have learned the required material.

However, some critics object to &quot;standardized tests&quot; not because they object to giving students the same test under the reasonably similar conditions and grading the responses the same way, because they object to the type of material that is typically tested by schools. Although standardized tests for non-academic attributes such as the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking exist, schools rarely give standardized tests to measure &quot;initiative, creativity, imagination...curiosity...good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes&quot;. Instead, the tests given by schools tend to focus less on moral or character development, and more on individual identifiable academic skills, such as reading comprehension and arithmetic. 

In his book, &quot;The Shame of the Nation,&quot; Jonathan Kozol argues that students submitted to standardized testing are victims of &quot;cognitive decapitation&quot;. Kozol comes to this realization after speaking to many children in inner city schools who have no spatial recollection of time, time periods, and historical events. This is especially the case in schools where due to shortages in funding and strict accountability policies, schools have done away with subjects like the arts, history and geography; in order to focus on the content of the mandated tests.

=== Test anxiety ===

Some people become anxious when taking a test. This phenomenon is more common for high-stakes tests than for low-stakes tests. High-stakes tests (whether standardized or non-standardized) can cause anxiety. 

There is criticism from students themselves that tests, while standardized, are unfair to the individual student. Some students claim they are &quot;bad test takers&quot;, meaning they get nervous and unfocused on tests. Therefore, while the test is standard and should provide fair results, the test takers claim that they are at a disadvantage and have no way to prove their knowledge otherwise, as there is no other testing alternative that allows students to prove their knowledge and problem-solving skills. 

Some students have test anxiety. Between ten and forty percent of students experience this type of anxiety. Children living in poverty are struck most with testing anxiety. Testing anxiety applies to both standardized and non-standardized tests.

=== Multiple-choice tests and test formats ===

A multiple-choice test provides the test taker with questions paired with a pre-determined list of possible answers. It is a type of closed-ended question. The test taker chooses the correct answer from the list. 

Many critics of standardized testing object to the multiple-choice format, which is commonly used for inexpensive, large-scale testing and which is not suitable for some purposes, such as seeing whether the test taker can write a paragraph. However, standardized testing can use any test format, including open-ended questions, so long as all test takers take the same test, under reasonably similar conditions, and get evaluated the same way.

=== Teaching to the test ===

Teaching to the test is a process of deliberately narrowing instruction to focus only on the material that will be measured on the test. For example, if the teacher knows that an upcoming history test will not include any questions about the history of music or art, then the teacher could &quot;teach to the test&quot; by skipping the material in the textbook about music and art. Critics also charge that standardized tests encourage &quot;teaching to the test&quot; at the expense of creativity and in-depth coverage of subjects not on the test. Critics say that teaching to the test disfavors higher-order learning; it transforms what the teachers are allowed to be teaching and heavily limits the amount of other information students learn throughout the years. While it is possible to use a standardized test without letting its contents determine curriculum and instruction, frequently, what is not tested is not taught, and how the subject is tested often becomes a model for how to teach the subject. 

Externally imposed tests, such as tests created by a department of education for students in their area, encourage teachers to narrow the curricular format and teach to the test.

&quot;Performance-based pay&quot; is the idea that teachers should be paid more if the students perform well on the tests, and less if they perform poorly. When teachers or schools are rewarded for better performance on tests, then those rewards encourage teachers to &quot;teach to the test&quot; instead of providing a rich and broad curriculum. In 2007 a qualitative study done by Au Wayne demonstrated that standardized testing narrows the curriculum and encourages teacher-centered instruction instead of student-centered learning. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie proposed educational reform in New Jersey that pressures teachers not only to &quot;teach to the test,&quot; but also have their students perform at the potential cost of their salary and job security. The reform called for performance-based pay that depends on students&#x27; performances on standardized tests and their educational gains.

Critics contend that overuse and misuse of these tests harms teaching and learning by narrowing the curriculum. According to the group FairTest, when standardized tests are the primary factor in accountability, schools use the tests to narrowly define curriculum and focus instruction. Accountability creates an immense pressure to perform and this can lead to the misuse and misinterpretation of standardized tests.

<doc id="225975" wikidata="Q509201" url="?curid=225975" title="Peg Woffington">
<text>Margaret Woffington (18 October 1720 – 28 March 1760), was an Irish actress and socialite of the Georgian era. 

==Early life==
Woffington was born of humble origins in Dublin, Ireland. Her father is thought to have been a bricklayer, and after his death, the family became impoverished. Her mother was obliged to take in washing while Peg sold watercress door to door. Madame Violante, a famous tightrope walker took her on as her apprentice. Her sister Mary Woffington was also an actress but she did not enjoy the same success.

==Acting career==
Around 1730, Madame Violante featured the young Woffington in her Lilliputian Theatre Company&#x27;s production of John Gay’s &quot;The Beggar’s Opera&quot;. Her performance as Mackheath served as a springboard for continued fame in Dublin. She continued dancing and acting in the area – playing Dorinda in an adaptation of &quot;The Tempest&quot; as the Theatre Royal, Dublin in 1735 and later joining the Smock Alley Theatre to perform with the well known actor, David Garrick. She danced and acted at various Dublin theatres until her early twenties, when her reputation drew a handsome offer from John Rich, the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, to perform on the stages of London. There, she found immediate success, in the role of Sylvia in &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; by George Farquhar.

She drew public attention when she was cast as Sir Harry Wildair in &quot;The Constant Couple.&quot; Audiences were intrigued, as at the time the role was highly associated with actor Robert Wilks, who had died seven years earlier. Nonetheless, her performance was well received, and audiences enjoyed her new interpretation of the role. She became well known as an actress thereafter. She performed at Drury Lane for several years and later returned to Dublin, appearing in a variety of plays. Her best-received performances were in comic roles, such as elegant women of fashion like Lady Betty Modish and Lady Townley, and breeches roles. She was impeded in the performance of tragedy by a harsh tone in her voice that she strove to eliminate.

While in London, she began living with fellow actor Charles Macklin. During this time, she became well acquainted with the foremost actor of the day David Garrick, and her other love affairs (including liaisons with Edward Bligh, 2nd Earl of Darnley and the MP Charles Hanbury Williams), were numerous and notorious. However, her affairs were not without controversy. One evening, Woffington and Garrick were almost caught in bed together by a visiting Noble Lord, who was believed to be enamoured with the actress. Upon fleeing, Garrick gathered his clothes, but noticed only once he had left the room that he had left behind his scratch wig. Woffington managed to evade the angry Lord&#x27;s accusations by claiming the wig was her own, for an upcoming breeches role.

Though she was popular with society figures, having entertained such illustrious names as Samuel Johnson and Henry Fielding, Peg Woffington was not always favoured by her competition. She tended to create rivalries with similar-types of actresses at Drury Lane and Covent Garden. She even managed to offend “tragediennes for whom Peg’s comic powers posed no threat” with her “queenly ways”. Her fiercest rivalry was with “equally peppery” actress Kitty Clive. According to Garrick&#x27;s biographer Thomas Davies, “No two women in high life ever hated each other more unreservedly than these two great dames of the stage.” When she returned to Covent Garden, rivalries with these women and with the manager, Mr. Rich, eventually sent her back to Dublin, where she was unrivalled and celebrated at the Smock Alley Theatre.
John Rich, manager of Covent Garden in London, decided to start a Beefsteak Club in 1749, also known as the Sublime Society of Steaks or “the Club.” Some of its members included Garrick and William Hogarth, as well as many other London celebrities. Not only was Peg Woffington the first female member of a (previously) all male dining club, in 1750 she became president of the club by election. She also educated and supported her sister Mary (usually known as Polly), and cared for and pensioned her mother.

Woffington parted from Garrick around 1744, and thence moved to the Thameside Middlesex village of Teddington, into a house called &#x27;Teddington Place&#x27; (the building was demolished in 1946, its former grounds now being occupied by Udney Hall Gardens park and St Alban&#x27;s Church, Teddington). In 1754 she became the beneficiary of the will of the Irish impresario Owen Swiny. In 1756, she performed the part of Lady Randolph in &quot;Douglas&quot;, a part which found a later exponent in Sarah Siddons.

On 3 May 1757, she was playing the part of Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot; when she collapsed on stage. She rallied, but would never act again, lingering with a wasting illness until 1760.

==Death==

She built and endowed by will some almshouses at Teddington, and after her death on 28 March 1760 in her 40th year her body was buried in the graveyard of St. Mary&#x27;s Church there. Though she was born into a Catholic family, she was buried a Protestant, having been received into the Church of Ireland on 31 December 1753. Woffington died a woman of wealth and had left most of her fortune to her sister, Mary.

==Portraits==
Considered a society beauty of her era, Woffington was painted by several artists, including Jacobus Lovelace in 1744, Peter van Bleeck in 1747, and John Lewis in 1753. She was also eulogised in a poetical sketch by the dramatist Henry Jones.

She has been portrayed as a character in the stage plays &quot;A Laughing Matter&quot; by April De Angelis. and &quot;Mr Foote&#x27;s Other Leg&quot; by Ian Kelly.

In 1852 Charles Reade and Tom Taylor wrote a play &quot;Masks and Faces&quot; which featured Woffington as a central character. Following the play&#x27;s success, Reade wrote a novel &quot;Peg Woffington&quot; in 1855. A play by Frances Aymar Mathews, &quot;Pretty Peggy&quot; (1902), starred Grace George as Woffington.

Woffington featured in several films, particularly in the silent era. These portrayals were largely based on the works of Reade and Taylor and include &quot;Peg Woffington&quot; (1910), &quot;Peg Woffington&quot; (1912) and &quot;Masks and Faces&quot; (1917). In 1935 Anna Neagle played Woffington in the comedy &quot;Peg of Old Drury&quot; with Cedric Hardwicke playing David Garrick. Her character appeared in the 2015 play &quot;Mr Foote&#x27;s Other Leg&quot; as a friend and colleague of Samuel Foote.

Woffington is also mentioned in the Cyclops episode of James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses.

Woffington appears as the main character in the graphic novel &quot;La pièce manquante&quot; (&quot;The Missing Play&quot;, 2023) by . Wanting to go down into history with a great role, she becomes interested in William Shakespeare&#x27;s missing play &quot;The History of Cardenio&quot; when her manager and close friend Ignatius Sancho tells her about it. She and Sancho then go on a quest to find it, but they also discover interests that try to keep them away from the play - including David Garrick, who is both Woffington&#x27;s competitor and unwelcomed suitor.

<doc id="225981" wikidata="Q3268349" url="?curid=225981" title="Sand wedge">
<text>A sand wedge, or sand iron, is a type of golf club, an open-faced wedge primarily designed for getting out of sand bunkers. It has the widest sole of any wedge, which provides the greatest amount of bounce, allowing the club head to glide through sand and avoid digging in. After Gene Sarazen had success in 1932 with a new club that he had invented for sand play, its popularity quickly grew. The club can be advantageous in other soft lies—such as thick rough, soggy ground, or mud—and is also used from firmer grass lies for lobs or chips.

==History==
Clubs with the loft of the sand wedge can be traced as far back as Young Tom Morris, who used a &quot;rut iron&quot; for play from troublesome lies. Such irons were, however, traditional in construction, without the wider, heavier sole featured on the modern sand wedge.

Gene Sarazen began to win tournaments in 1932 with a new club he had invented that was specialized for sand play. He is hailed as the inventor of the sand wedge, though its history goes about 4 years further back than that. Spoon clubs offered varying degrees of loft and allowed players to scoop their ball out of sand traps and deep rough. As manufacturers became more and more innovative with club design, new types of wedges appeared. Some had faces, others featured deeply faces, but not all of these designs conformed to USGA and R&amp;A regulations, and many were banned. With the concave-faced wedge having been outlawed in 1931, Sarazen designed his sand wedge with a straight face. Another modification that he made was to add extra lead to the front edge of the club face, allowing it to cut through the sand more smoothly. After he won the 1932 British and U.S. Opens with the help of his new club, its popularity vastly grew.

==Design==
The modern sand wedge is often the heaviest iron in a player&#x27;s bag, with most weighing nearly 16 oz (470 grams). Traditionally it also had the highest loft at 56 degrees (55–56 being most common), although that distinction now goes to the lob wedge, which often has a loft of 60 degrees or more. It usually has one of the shortest shafts, between and , though in some sets the sand wedge has a longer shaft than the pitching wedge.

===Bounce===
The main distinguishing difference of the club from most others, however, is a feature called bounce. On most other irons, the sole of the club is perpendicular to the shaft, meaning it is roughly parallel to the ground when the club is at rest, allowing the to get between the ball and the ground more easily. A sand wedge however is designed with the sole of the club at an angle to the ground in the same position, lifting the leading edge of the club off the ground. This design accomplishes three things:First, this design generally requires more material, which increases the weight of the club head for more momentum and places that weight low and forward in the club head for higher launches.Second, the angled sole lifts the leading edge off the ground at the bottom of the swing, preventing the club from digging in to softer lies—e.g., sand, muddy ground, and thick grass—instead tending to skim over the surface. This in turn allows players more flexibility when addressing the ball; the player can line the ball up in the centre of their stance and take a normal swing in which the club will skim over the turf before contact with the ball, or alternatively they can move the ball rearward in their stance (towards the right foot for a right-handed player) and strike the ball earlier in the swing. The natural consequence of such a correctly executed shot is that the club face has less loft at contact, so the ball is launched at a lower angle for more distance. Without bounce, such a shot will generally cause the club to dig into the ground after it contacts the ball, even if executed correctly. With such a high-lofted club, the player is prevented from following through on their swing and can be injured.Lastly, when playing from a bunker, the ball may have buried itself deeply into the sand (depending on the sand&#x27;s consistency and the degree of impact, the ball may be completely submerged). To lift it out, the club head must contact the ball from underneath, meaning the leading edge of the club must sometimes be under the surface of the sand at contact. The angle of the sole counteracts the natural downward pressure of the club face digging itself ever deeper into the sand, making it easier to swing the club down under the surface of the sand and then lift the club—and the ball—back out again.Other clubs, especially short irons and other wedges, now incorporate a small degree of bounce to assist in plays from the rough or other soft lies, but the sand wedge will typically have the highest amount of bounce of any club in a player&#x27;s bag. There are however exceptions; Callaway Golf for instance markets a &quot;Big Bertha&quot; line of irons in which the lob wedge has significantly higher bounce than the sand wedge.

==Usage==
As its name suggests, a sand wedge is used most often to extract the ball from a sand bunker. However, the features which make it useful for this purpose are advantageous in other soft lies such as thick rough, soggy ground, or mud. It is also used from firmer grass lies for lobs or chips, generally onto the green. It can also be used as any other short iron would; with a full swing, a skilled golfer can typically hit a sand wedge between . Tour players often use a lob wedge (60° wedge) to get out of bunkers with controlled trajectory and much spin.

<doc id="225982" wikidata="Q4480008" url="?curid=225982" title="Ground state">
<text>The ground state of a quantum-mechanical system is its stationary state of lowest energy; the energy of the ground state is known as the zero-point energy of the system. An excited state is any state with energy greater than the ground state. In quantum field theory, the ground state is usually called the vacuum state or the vacuum.

If more than one ground state exists, they are said to be degenerate. Many systems have degenerate ground states. Degeneracy occurs whenever there exists a unitary operator that acts non-trivially on a ground state and commutes with the Hamiltonian of the system.

According to the third law of thermodynamics, a system at absolute zero temperature exists in its ground state; thus, its entropy is determined by the degeneracy of the ground state. Many systems, such as a perfect crystal lattice, have a unique ground state and therefore have zero entropy at absolute zero. It is also possible for the highest excited state to have absolute zero temperature for systems that exhibit negative temperature.

== Absence of nodes in one dimension ==
In one dimension, the ground state of the Schrödinger equation can be proven to have no nodes.

=== Derivation ===
Consider the average energy of a state with a node at ; i.e., . The average energy in this state would be

formula_1

where is the potential.

With integration by parts:

formula_2

Hence in case that formula_3 is equal to &quot;zero&quot;, one gets:
formula_4

Now, consider a small interval around formula_5; i.e., formula_6. Take a new (deformed) wave function to be defined as formula_7, for formula_8; and formula_9, for formula_10; and constant for formula_6. If formula_12 is small enough, this is always possible to do, so that is continuous.

Assuming formula_13 around formula_5, one may write
formula_15
where formula_16 is the norm.

Note that the kinetic-energy densities hold formula_17 everywhere because of the normalization. More significantly, the average kinetic energy is lowered by formula_18 by the deformation to .

Now, consider the potential energy. For definiteness, let us choose formula_19. Then it is clear that, outside the interval formula_6, the potential energy density is smaller for the because formula_21 there.

On the other hand, in the interval formula_6 we have
formula_23
which holds to order formula_24.

However, the contribution to the potential energy from this region for the state with a node is
formula_25
lower, but still of the same lower order formula_26 as for the deformed state , and subdominant to the lowering of the average kinetic energy.
Therefore, the potential energy is unchanged up to order formula_27, if we deform the state formula_28 with a node into a state without a node, and the change can be ignored.

We can therefore remove all nodes and reduce the energy by formula_18, which implies that cannot be the ground state. Thus the ground-state wave function cannot have a node. This completes the proof. (The average energy may then be further lowered by eliminating undulations, to the variational absolute minimum.)

=== Implication ===
As the ground state has no nodes it is &quot;spatially&quot; non-degenerate, i.e. there are no two stationary quantum states with the energy eigenvalue of the ground state (let&#x27;s name it formula_30) and the same spin state and therefore would only differ in their position-space wave functions.

The reasoning goes by contradiction: For if the ground state would be degenerate then there would be two orthonormal stationary states formula_31 and formula_32 — later on represented by their complex-valued position-space wave functions formula_33 and formula_34 — and any superposition formula_35 with the complex numbers formula_36 fulfilling the condition formula_37 would also be a be such a state, i.e. would have the same energy-eigenvalue formula_30 and the same spin-state.

Now let formula_39 be some random point (where both wave functions are defined) and set:
formula_40
and
formula_41
with
formula_42
(according to the premise &quot;no nodes&quot;).

Therefore, the position-space wave function of formula_43 is
formula_44

Hence
formula_45
for all formula_46.

But formula_47 i.e., formula_39 is &quot;a node&quot; of the ground state wave function and that is in contradiction to the premise that this wave function cannot have a node.

Note that the ground state could be degenerate because of different &quot;spin states&quot; like formula_49 and formula_50 while having the same position-space wave function: Any superposition of these states would create a mixed spin state but leave the spatial part (as a common factor of both) unaltered.

== Examples ==

* The wave function of the ground state of a particle in a one-dimensional box is a half-period sine wave, which goes to zero at the two edges of the well. The energy of the particle is given by formula_51, where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the particle, &quot;n&quot; is the energy state (&quot;n&quot; = 1 corresponds to the ground-state energy), and &quot;L&quot; is the width of the well.
* The wave function of the ground state of a hydrogen atom is a spherically symmetric distribution centred on the nucleus, which is largest at the center and reduces exponentially at larger distances. The electron is most likely to be found at a distance from the nucleus equal to the Bohr radius. This function is known as the 1s atomic orbital. For hydrogen (H), an electron in the ground state has energy , relative to the ionization threshold. In other words, 13.6 eV is the energy input required for the electron to no longer be bound to the atom.
* The exact definition of one second of time since 1997 has been the duration of periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K.

<text>John Augustin Daly (July 20, 1838 – June 7, 1899) was one of the most influential men in American theatre during his lifetime. Drama critic, theatre manager, playwright, and adapter, he became the first recognized stage director in America. He exercised fierce and tyrannical control over all aspects of his productions. His rules of conduct for actors and actresses imposed heavy fines for late appearances and forgotten lines and earned him the title &quot;the autocrat of the stage.&quot; He formed a permanent company in New York and opened Daly&#x27;s Theatre in New York in 1879, and a second one in London in 1893.

==Biography==
Augustin Daly was born in Plymouth, North Carolina to Captain Denis Daly, sea-captain and ship owner, and Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant John Duffy of the British Army. He was educated in Norfolk, Virginia, and in the public schools of New York City. His mother, early left a widow, brought her two boys to New York City, where they soon became frequent attendants at the theaters and were members of amateur groups under such names as the &quot;Burton Association&quot; or the &quot;Murdoch Association&quot; were the precursors of the Little Theatre Movement.

He was a dramatic critic for several New York papers from 1859, and he adapted or wrote a number of plays, &quot;Under the Gaslight&quot; (1867) being his first success. In 1869 he became the manager of the Fifth Avenue Theatre on 24th St. and in 1873 the Fifth Avenue Theatre on 28th. In 1879 he rebuilt and opened Daly&#x27;s Theatre on Broadway and 30th Street in New York, and, in 1893, Daly&#x27;s Theatre in London.
At the first of these, he gathered a company of players, headed by Ada Rehan, which made for it a high reputation, and for them he adapted plays from foreign sources, and revived Shakespearean comedies in a manner before unknown in America. He took his entire company on tour, visiting England, Germany and France, and some of the best actors on the American stage have owed their training and first successes to him. Among these were Clara Morris, Sara Jewett, John Drew, Jr., Maurice Barrymore, Fanny Davenport, Agnes Ethel, Maude Adams, Mrs. Gilbert, Tyrone Power, Sr., Ada Dyas, Isadora Duncan, Maud Jeffries and many others. Daly&#x27;s willingness to, as he put it, &quot;stoop to the curb and bestow upon the low, untried actor a chance at greatness&quot; earned him the nickname &quot;Little Man Auggie&quot; among his peers. His play &quot;Leah the Forsaken&quot;, adapted from Hermann Salomon Mosenthal&#x27;s &quot;Deborah&quot;, was a star vehicle for Margaret Mather.

His Shakespeare productions were often severely criticized by George Bernard Shaw, who was active as a drama critic during those years. Shaw took Daly to task for cutting Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and for presenting them in unorthodox ways. (Shaw was a strong believer in presenting Shakespeare&#x27;s plays uncut.) Several of Shaw&#x27;s criticisms of Daly&#x27;s Shakespeare productions were reprinted in the anthology &quot;Shaw on Shakespeare&quot;.

In 1894, he was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics.

Daly was a great book-lover, and his valuable library was dispersed by auction after his death, which occurred in Paris. Besides plays, original and adapted, he wrote &quot;Woffington: a Tribute to the Actress and the Woman&quot; (1888).

He died on 7th June 1899 in Paris aged 60 and laid to rest in Calvary Cemetery, Woodside, Queens County, New York, US. 

Dora Knowlton Ranous, a onetime actress in the Daly company, published a 1910 memoir of her experiences entitled &quot;Diary of a Daly Débutante.&quot;

==Notable works==

&quot;Under the Gaslight&quot; (1867) is an example of Daly&#x27;s mixture of realism and melodrama, seen in the authenticity of his depiction of real locations and in his use of social commentary. The play introduced the now-clichéd device of the villain tying someone to railroad tracks, although in a reversal of the usual roles it was the hero who was tied up and the heroine who saved him. In the book &quot;Vagrant Memories,&quot; the author, William Winter recalls how Daly came up with the device. He says: &quot;He once told me under what circumstances he hit upon this device. He was walking home toward night, thinking intently about the play which he had begun to write, when suddenly the crowning expedient occurred to him and at the same instant he stumbled over a misplaced flagstone, striking his right foot against the edge of the stone and sustaining a severe hurt. &quot;I was near my door,&quot; he said, &quot;and I rushed into the house, threw myself into a chair, grasping my injured foot with both hands, for the pain was great, and exclaiming, over and over again, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got it! I&#x27;ve got it! And it beats hot-irons all to pieces!&quot; I wasn&#x27;t even thinking of the hurt. I had the thought of having my hero tied on a railroad track and rescued by his sweetheart, just in the nick of time, before the swift passage of an express train across a dark stage. 
&quot;A Flash of Lightning&quot; (1868), like &quot;Under the Gaslight&quot;, is pure melodrama, with water and fire spectacles providing action scenes and special effects for its eager audiences.

&quot;Horizon&quot; (1871) is an adaptation of a Bret Harte story about the westward expansion of the States; it is an example of the popularity of western drama, coupled with Daly&#x27;s interest in realism of the local color variety, although it remains melodramatic.

&quot;Divorce&quot; (1871) and &quot;Pique&quot; (1875), both adaptations of British novels, demonstrate Daly&#x27;s attempts to create social comedy, although the plays remain somewhat melodramatic.

<doc id="225990" wikidata="Q4020008" url="?curid=225990" title="William Franklin">
<text>William Franklin (22 February 1730 – 17 November 1813) was an American-born attorney, soldier, politician, and colonial administrator. He was the acknowledged extra-marital son of Benjamin Franklin. William Franklin was the last colonial Governor of New Jersey (1763–1776), and a steadfast Loyalist throughout the American Revolutionary War. In contrast, his father Benjamin was, in later life, one of the most prominent of the Patriot leaders of the American Revolution and a Founding Father of the United States.

Following imprisonment by Patriots in 1776 to 1778, William became the chief leader of the Loyalists. From his base in New York City, he organized military units to fight on the British side. In 1782, he went into exile in Britain. He lived in London until his death.

==Early life==
William Franklin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then a colony in British America. He was the extra-marital son of Benjamin Franklin, a leading figure in the city. His mother&#x27;s identity is unknown. Confusion exists about William&#x27;s birth and parentage because Benjamin Franklin was secretive about his son&#x27;s origins. In 1750, Benjamin Franklin told his mother that William was nineteen years old, but this may have been an attempt to make the youth appear to have been conceived within marriage. Some older reference books give William&#x27;s birth year as 1731.

William was raised by his father and Deborah Read, his father&#x27;s common-law wife; she had been abandoned by her legal husband but not divorced. William always called her his mother. There is some speculation that Deborah Read was William&#x27;s biological mother, and because of his parents&#x27; common-law relationship, the circumstances of his birth were obscured so as not to be politically harmful to him or to their marital arrangement.

William joined a company of Pennsylvania provincial troops in 1746 and spent a winter in Albany in King George&#x27;s War, obtaining the rank of captain in 1747. As he grew older, he accompanied his father on several missions, including trips to England. Although often depicted as a young child when he assisted his father in the famed kite experiment of 1752, William was at least 21 years old at the time.

==Marriage and family==
As a young man, William became engaged to Elizabeth Graeme, daughter of prominent Philadelphia physician Dr. Thomas Graeme and step-granddaughter of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 14th Governor, Sir William Keith. Neither family approved of the match, but when William went to London to study law about 1759, he left with the understanding that Elizabeth would wait for him.
William studied law at the Middle Temple, chiefly under Richard Jackson &quot;The Omniscient&quot;. While in London, William fathered an illegitimate son, William Temple Franklin, who was born 22 February 1762. His mother has never been identified, and Temple was placed in foster care.

Later that year, William married Elizabeth Downes on 4 September 1762 at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, in London. She was born in the English colony of Barbados to the sugar planter John Downes and his wife, Elizabeth (). She met William while visiting England with her father in 1760. They moved to the New Jersey colony in 1763. Elizabeth died in 1777 while he was imprisoned as a Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War. She was interred beneath the altar of St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel in lower Manhattan, where she had resided after the British evacuated Perth Amboy. The memorial plaque on the wall at St. Paul&#x27;s was commissioned by William Franklin from London, where he went into exile following the war. He was a widower for more than ten years.

On 14 August 1788, William married Mary Johnson d&#x27;Evelin, a wealthy Irish widow with children. William&#x27;s son, Temple, after a failed business career in the U.S., lived with his father and stepmother for a time, and followed in his grandfather and father&#x27;s footsteps and had an illegitimate daughter, Ellen (15 May 1798 London – 1875 Nice, France), with Ellen Johnson d&#x27;Evelin, the sister-in-law of his stepmother, Mary. William took responsibility for his granddaughter Ellen. Temple moved to Paris, where he lived the remainder of his life and never saw his father again. After Mary died in 1811, William continued to live with Ellen, age 13 at the time, and when he died in 1813 he left most of his small estate to her.

==Colonial governor==
William Franklin completed his law education in England, and was admitted to the bar. William and Benjamin Franklin became partners and confidants, working together to pursue land grants in what was then called the Northwest (now Midwest). Before they left England, Benjamin lobbied hard to procure his son an appointment, especially working with the Prime Minister Lord Bute.

William was inducted into the original American Philosophical Society, founded by Benjamin Franklin, around 1758.

In 1763, William Franklin was appointed as the Royal Governor of New Jersey. He had asked Lord Bute for the position. Bute made the decision secretly to grant the request, not even informing Benjamin Franklin; he intended the position as a reward for Benjamin&#x27;s role and a move to weaken the Penn faction. He replaced Josiah Hardy, a merchant and colonial administrator who sided with the New Jersey legislature against the government in London. Randall states:

==American War of Independence==

Owing to his father&#x27;s role as a Founding Father and William&#x27;s loyalty to Britain, the relationship between father and son became strained past the breaking point. When Benjamin decided to take up the Patriot cause, he tried to convince William to join him, but the son refused. After Benjamin Franklin was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by Solicitor-General Alexander Wedderburn before the Privy Council on 29 January 1774, he expected his son to resign in protest. Instead, William advised his father to take his medicine and retire from office.

His Loyalist position was a reflection of his respect for benevolent authority which he felt was embodied by the British Crown, a view consistent with his father&#x27;s earlier Anglophilia. Further, unlike his father William was a devout member of the Church of England, which reinforced his loyalty to the Crown. Financially, he needed the salary and perquisites. On 13 January 1775, with revolution seeming imminent, Franklin delivered his &quot;Two Roads&quot; speech to the New Jersey legislature, urging the New Jersey Legislature to take the road toward prosperity as a part of England rather than a road to civil war and anarchy. The legislature instead unanimously issued a resolution in support of the radicals in Boston.

===Capture and imprisonment, 1776–1778===
William Franklin remained as governor of New Jersey, and secretly reported Patriot activities to London. He continued as governor until January 1776, when colonial militiamen placed him under house arrest, which lasted until the middle of June. After the Declaration of Independence, Franklin was formally taken into custody by order of the Provincial Congress of New Jersey, an entity which he refused to recognize, regarding it as an &quot;illegal assembly&quot;. He was incarcerated in Connecticut for two years, in Wallingford and Middletown. He surreptitiously engaged Americans in supporting the Loyalist cause. Discovered, he was held in solitary confinement at Litchfield, Connecticut for eight months. When finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778, he moved to New York City, which was still occupied by the British.

===New York Loyalist leader, 1778–1781===
Once in New York, Boyd Schlenther says he became, &quot;the acknowledged leader of the American loyalists, for whom he struggled to secure aid. He also built up an unofficial yet active spy network.&quot; He set up Loyalist military units to fight the Patriots, such as &quot;Bacon&#x27;s Refugees&quot;. In 1779, he had learned through his friend Jonathan Odell and British Secret Service agent John André that Benedict Arnold was secretly defecting to the British.

While in New York, Franklin tried to encourage a guerrilla war and active reprisals against the rebels but was frustrated by British Commander-in-Chief General Henry Clinton, who did not support the idea or had much use for American Loyalists. Nonetheless, Franklin coordinated a multi-colony group known as the Associated Loyalists that waged guerrilla warfare in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. A correspondence between Franklin&#x27;s collaborator, British General William Tryon, and Lord George Germain led to Franklin receiving official blessing for the operation in 1780.

===Asgill Affair===

In 1782 Franklin was implicated in the Loyalist officer Richard Lippincott&#x27;s hanging of Joshua Huddy. During a raid, Loyalist troops under Franklin&#x27;s general oversight captured Joshua Huddy, an officer of the New Jersey militia. The Loyalist soldiers hanged Huddy in revenge for similar killings of Loyalists, particularly Phillip White. Huddy was a member of the Association of Retaliation, a vigilante body with a history of attacking and killing Loyalists and neutrals in New Jersey. At the time, some alleged that Franklin had sanctioned the killing of Huddy. This claim was theoretically substantiated by a note left on Huddy&#x27;s body, which read, &quot;Up goes Huddy for Philip White.&quot;

When he heard of Huddy&#x27;s death, General George Washington threatened to execute Captain Charles Asgill, a British officer who had been captured at Yorktown, unless Lippincott were handed over to the American military. The British refused, but tried Lippincott. The British acquitted him of charges in the hanging. Due to the intervention of the French King Louis XVI, who interceded with his American allies to prevent Asgill&#x27;s execution, the British officer was eventually released by the Continental Congress, where it was agreed he should return to England on parole. Despite the speed with which it was terminated, the Asgill Affair temporarily stalled peace talks between American and British authorities, extending uncertainty over the United States&#x27; prospects. Ironically, Benjamin Franklin was a senior negotiator for the revolutionary Americans in Paris when the Asgill Affair occurred.

==Exile and death==
The Surrender at Yorktown in October 1781 dimmed British hopes for victory, and in 1782, William Franklin departed for Britain, never to return. Once in London, he became a leading spokesman for the Loyalist community. Because of the continued strength of British forces in North America, in spite of the disaster at Yorktown, many expected Britain to continue fighting the war. The British naval victory against the French at the Battle of the Saintes and the successful defence of Gibraltar also raised their hopes. In summer 1782, a new British government came to power, who still hoped to achieve a reconciliation with the American colonies.

In 1783 he visited Scotland and was asked to be a founding member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Benjamin Franklin dedicated his autobiography (written before the war) to his son, though the only mention of William within the manuscript is the inclusion of a newspaper article in which Franklin noted that his son was authorized to make contracts to purchase carts for the British army. But the father and son were never reconciled; the elder Franklin became known for his uncompromising position related to not providing compensation nor amnesty for the Loyalists who left the colonies, during the negotiations in Paris for the Peace of Paris. His son&#x27;s covert operations and involvement in total war as a Loyalist contributed to his position. The British government gave him £1,800 from the Commissioners of Loyalist Claims. That was the value of his furniture; there was no payment for his lands. He also received a brigadier&#x27;s half-pay pension of £800 per year.
William Franklin sent a letter to his father, dated 22 July 1784, in an attempt at reconciliation. His father never accepted his royalist position, but he responded in a letter dated 16 August 1784, in which he states &quot;[We] will endeavor, as you propose mutually to forget what has happened relating to it, as well we can.&quot; William saw his father one last time in 1785, when Benjamin stopped in Britain on his return journey to the U.S. after his time in France. The meeting was brief and involved tying up outstanding legal matters. In a reconciliation attempt, Benjamin also proposed that his son give land that he owned in New York and New Jersey to William&#x27;s son Temple, who had served as Benjamin&#x27;s secretary during the war and for whom the elder Franklin had great affection, in order to repay a debt William owed his father; in the event, William transferred the New York portion of the land. In his 1788 will, Benjamin left William virtually none of his wealth, except some nearly worthless territory in Nova Scotia and some property already in William&#x27;s possession. He stated in the will that the way William &quot;acted against me in the late war, which is of public notoriety, will account for my leaving him no more of an estate he endeavoured to deprive me of.&quot;

William died on 17 November 1813, in London, and was buried in London&#x27;s St Pancras Old Church churchyard.

==Legacy and honors==
* Franklin Township in Bergen County, New Jersey, was named in William&#x27;s honor, as was the borough of Franklin Lakes.

==In popular culture==
William Franklin is referenced in a humorous dialogue exchange in the stage musical &quot;1776&quot;. During a session of the Continental Congress, John Hancock asks Benjamin Franklin if he has heard any news from his son, whom Hancock calls the Royal Governor of New Jersey. To this Dr. Franklin responds, &quot;As that title might suggest, sir, we are not in touch at the present time.&quot; Later when a new congressional delegation from New Jersey arrives, the leader of the delegation, Rev. John Witherspoon, informs Dr. Franklin of William&#x27;s arrest and transferral to Connecticut. Upon learning that William is unharmed, Dr. Franklin contemptuously answers, &quot;Tell me, why did they arrest the little bastard?&quot;

William Franklin is referenced in Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x27;s &quot;Ben Franklin&#x27;s Song&quot;, a supplement to the musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;. The song, sung from Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s perspective, references his son William&#x27;s imprisonment with the lyrics:

: One pain that lingers, the hitch in my stride
: Is my son back at home who I could not guide
: Who sits all alone in a prison cell on the wrong side
: Stands against our young nation.

William Franklin is also referenced occasionally in the Apple TV+ series &quot;Franklin&quot; by several characters, including by his son, William Temple Franklin, as well as Benjamin Franklin himself.

Franklin is portrayed by Daniel Betts in 2024 drama film &quot;Here&quot;.

<text>Anne Hartley Gilbert (October 21, 1821December 2, 1904) professionally billed as Mrs G. H. Gilbert was a British cross-dressing actress.

She was born Anne Jane Hartley at Rochdale, Lancashire, England. At fifteen she was a pupil at the ballet school connected with Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, in the Haymarket, conducted by Paul Taglioni, and became a dancer. Her first conspicuous appearance on stage was made as a dancer, in the Norwich theatrical circuit, England, in 1845. In 1846 she married George H. Gilbert (d. 1866), a performer in the theatre company of which she was a member. Together they filled many engagements in English theatres, moving to America in 1849.

Her first 15 years in America were spent in inland cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. Mrs Gilbert&#x27;s first success in a speaking part was in 1857 as Wichavenda in John Brougham&#x27;s &quot;Po-ca-hon-tas&quot;.

One of the most brilliant and decisive successes of her professional life was gained at the Broadway Theatre where, on 5 August 1867, Mr and Mrs W. J. Florence presented Thomas William Robertson&#x27;s comedy &quot;Caste&quot;, for the first time in America. On leaving the Broadway she went to Daly&#x27;s Fifth Avenue Theatre on Twenty-fourth Street with Robertson&#x27;s comedy of &quot;Play&quot;. The cast included E. L. Davenport, George Holland, William Davidge, J. L. Polk, Agnes Ethel, and George Clarke. Mrs Gilbert played Mrs Kinpeck. For many years she played opposite James Lewis as his &quot;wife&quot;, or playing old women&#x27;s parts, in which she had no equal.

After Mr Daly&#x27;s death in 1899 she came under Charles Frohman&#x27;s management and later became a member of Annie Russell&#x27;s company. On 24 October 1904, at the New Lyceum Theatre, Mrs Gilbert made her first appearance as a star, being then in the eighty-second year of her age, in a play, by Clyde Fitch, called &quot;Granny&quot; with a young Marie Doro in one of her earliest roles. Granny was announced as her farewell role and she read a special poem composed by Fitch at the end of each performance. Her final New York appearance occurred at the Lyceum on 12 November 1904. She acted for fifty-four years (after five years as a dancer), and she remained in active employment to the last. Mrs Gilbert was uniquely respected and popular, both with audiences and behind the footlights. She performed last on 1 December, three days after &quot;Granny&quot; opened in Chicago, and died there on the following day from a brain haemorrhage.

<text>John Brougham (9 May 1814 – 7 June 1880) was an Irish and American actor, dramatist, poet, theatre manager, and author. As an actor and dramatist he had most of his career in the United States, where he was celebrated for his portrayals of comic Irish characters.

The author of more than seventy-five dramatic works, with some sources stating more than 150, he was particularly successful in the genres of burlesque and satire. His numerous subversive, satirical stage works earned him the nickname as &quot;The American Aristophanes&quot; among critics. In addition to his work as a playwright, Brougham published two volumes of his miscellaneous writings. These included essays, poems, and other works.

Born and raised primarily in Dublin, Brougham began higher education aiming to become a surgeon. Forced to end his studies, he moved to London in 1830 where he began his career as a professional actor. He staged his first play in that city in 1831. He performed for a decade in the theatre troupe of actress Lucia Elizabeth Vestris and her husband Charles James Mathews, first at the Olympic Theatre and then the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (now the Royal Opera House).

In 1840 Brougham became manager of the Lyceum Theatre, London. Two years later in 1842 he emigrated to the United States. There he made his stage debut at the Park Theatre, New York City in 1842.

Brougham rapidly became a favorite actor among the American public in a wide range of contemporary plays. He toured the United States in theatre troupes led by the impresarios William Evans Burton and James William Wallack, in addition to appearing on Broadway with some frequency.

During this period he also worked as a theatre manager in New York City, managing such theaters as Niblo&#x27;s Garden, Brougham&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre, and the Bowery Theatre. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1844 upon his second marriage, to American actress Annette Hawley. He left the United States at the height of his popularity just prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War. He returned to England in September 1860 to work once again on the London stage.

After further performances in England and Ireland in the first half of the 1860s, Brougham returned to New York City in October 1865, after the end of the war, to join the company of players at the Winter Garden Theatre. By this time his popularity had declined, but he remained active as a performer at the Winter Garden and in the theatre troupe of Augustin Daly until October 1879. He died eight months later in New York City in June 1880.

==Early life and education==
John Brougham was born in Dublin on 9 May 1814. The eldest of three children, he was the only child in the family to survive to adulthood. His father, an amateur painter, died young. His mother, the daughter of a Protestant French Huguenot, was forced to live in exile due to the politics and religious persecution of her time. She was mired in poverty and arranged for John Brougham to be raised in the home of his uncle.

Brougham was prepared for college at an academy at Trim, County Meath, twenty miles from Dublin. After this he matriculated to Trinity College Dublin; where he acquired a classical education and became involved in student theatrical productions. There he formed interesting and useful associations and acquaintances that assisted him in his later career as an actor and dramatist.

He became acquainted with the actress Lucia Elizabeth Vestris, and became involved with a social set of friends who produced their own plays. They cast parts by drawing names out of a hat. Though Brougham usually traded off larger roles in order to focus on his studies, he was deeply interested in acting. Additionally, he frequently attended performances at the Theatre Royal, Dublin.

Brougham&#x27;s uncle encouraged his education with the goal of becoming a surgeon. He briefly was a surgical student at Peter Street Hospital. Having fallen into difficult economic conditions, his uncle had to end his financial support and Brougham had to stop his education. In order to support himself financially, he relocated to London in 1830.

==Career==

While having a brief experience of living in poverty in London, Brougham had a chance meeting with Lucia Elizabeth Vestri; whom he had befriended earlier at Trinity College. Vestri used her influence as an actress at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Tottenham Court Road to secure Bougham work in that theatre&#x27;s production of William Thomas Moncrieff&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. He made his professional London stage debut in July 1930 portraying six characters in that work.

In 1831 Brougham was a member of Vestris&#x27;s company which was the resident troupe at London&#x27;s Olympic Theatre, and was managed by Vestris&#x27;s husband Charles Mathews. He wrote his first play, a burlesque as a starring vehicle for her in 1832. He remained with Madame Vestris&#x27;s company for a decade; continuing with the organization after it left the Olympic Theatre in 1839 to take up residency at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (now the Royal Opera House). With Dion Boucicault he co-authored the 1841 play &quot;London Assurance&quot; (1841), the role of Dazzle being one of those with which he became associated. However, the relationship between Boucicault and Brougham soured, and after the work premiered Brougham relinquished his authorship rights in a lawsuit settlement and left the production at the Theatre Royal.

In 1840 Brougham was appointed manager of the Lyceum Theatre, London, for which he wrote several light burlesques. In 1842 he moved to the United States, where he made his debut starring in a production of William Bayle Bernard&#x27;s &quot;His Last Legs&quot; at the Park Theatre in Manhattan. He became a member of WE Burton&#x27;s company, for which he wrote several comedies, including &quot;Met-a-mora; or, the Last of the Pollywogs&quot;, a parody of John A. Stone and Edwin Forrest&#x27;s &quot;Metamora; or The Last of the Wamponoags&quot;, and &quot;Irish Yankee; or, The Birthday of Freedom&quot;.

Later he was the manager of Niblo&#x27;s Garden, and in 1850 opened Brougham&#x27;s Lyceum, which, like his next speculation, the lease of the Bowery Theatre, was not a financial success, despite the popularity of such works as &quot;Po-ca-hon-tas; or, The Gentle Savage&quot;. He was later connected with Wallack&#x27;s and Daly&#x27;s theatres, and wrote plays for both. In 1852, he edited a comedic paper, &quot;The Lantern&quot;, and published two collections of miscellaneous writings, &quot;A Basket of Chips&quot; and &quot;The Bunsby Papers&quot;. In 1857, he published &quot;A Day in New York&quot;.

In 1860 he returned to London, where he adapted or wrote several plays, including &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Motto&quot; for Fechter. In November 1864 he appeared at the Theatre Royal in his native Dublin in the first performance of Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;Arrah-na-Pogue&quot; with Boucicault, Samuel Johnson and Samuel Anderson Emery in the cast.

After the American Civil War he returned to New York City. Brougham&#x27;s Theatre was opened in 1869 with his comedies &quot;Better Late than Never&quot; and &quot;Much Ado About a Merchant of Venice&quot;, but this managerial experience was also a failure, due to disagreements with his business partner, Jim Fisk, and he took to playing the stock market. His last appearance onstage was in 1879 as &quot;O&#x27;Reilly, the detective&quot; in Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;Rescued&quot;. He died in Manhattan in 1880.

Brougham was a founding member and first vice president of the Lotos Club in New York (established 1870), and for a time its president.

==Marriages==
He was twice married, in 1838 to Emma Williams (d. 1865), and, in 1844, to Annette Hawley, daughter of Captain Nelson, R.N., and widow of Mr. Hodges (d. 1870), both actresses.

==Plays==
Sources vary in stating the number of plays Broughman authored with the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; stating he wrote more the 75 dramatic works, and the &quot;Historical Dictionary of American Theater&quot; stating he authored more than 150 plays. Broughman was particularly adept at writing satirical comedies, and his significant output of subversive satires earned him the nickname &quot;The American Aristophanes&quot; from critics of the time.

Brougham&#x27;s 1880 obituary in &quot;The New York Tribune&quot; listed the following works as his &quot;most conspicuous plays&quot;: &quot;Life in the Clouds&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Livery&quot;, &quot;Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Thom Thumb the Second&quot;, &quot;The Demon Gift&quot; (with Mark Lemon), &quot;Bunsby&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, &quot;The Confidence Man&quot;, &quot;Don Caeser de Bassoon&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The Irish Yankee&quot;, &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;, &quot;All&#x27;s Fair in Love&quot;, &quot;The Irish Emigrant&quot;, &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (dramatization), &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Ambrose Germain&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Fair&quot;, &quot;Faustus&quot;, &quot;The Spirit of Air&quot;, &quot;Row at the Lyceum&quot;, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (dramatization), &quot;The Actress of Padua&quot; (new version), &quot;The Pirates of the Mississippi&quot;, &quot;The Red Mask&quot;, &quot;Orion, the Gold-Beater&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry in America&quot;, &quot;The Miller of New Jersey&quot;, &quot;The Game of Love&quot;, &quot;Bleak House&quot; (adaptation), &quot;My Cousin German&quot;, &quot;A Decided Case&quot;, &quot;The Game of Life&quot;, &quot;Pocahantas&quot;, &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Defeat&quot;, &quot;Love and Murder&quot;, &quot;Romance and Reality&quot;, &quot;The Ruling Passion&quot;, &quot;Playing With Fire&quot;, &quot;Columbus&quot; (burlesque), &quot;This House to Be Sold&quot;, &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Motto&quot;, &quot;Bel Demonio&quot;, &quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot; (adaptation), &quot;Only a Clod&quot; (adaptation), &quot;Better Late than Never&quot;, &quot;The Emerald Ring&quot;, &quot;Irish Stew&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About a Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;The Red Light&quot;, &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Luck&quot;, &quot;John Garth&quot;, and &quot;The Lily of France&quot;.

Other works included &quot;The Lottery of Life&quot; (1867), and &quot;Home Rule&quot;, his final work.

<text>In functional analysis, a unitary operator is a surjective bounded operator on a Hilbert space that preserves the inner product. Unitary operators are usually taken as operating &quot;on&quot; a Hilbert space, but the same notion serves to define the concept of isomorphism &quot;between&quot; Hilbert spaces.

== Definition ==
Definition 1. A &quot;unitary operator&quot; is a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space that satisfies , where is the adjoint of , and is the identity operator.

The weaker condition defines an &quot;isometry&quot;. The other weaker condition, , defines a &quot;coisometry&quot;. Thus a unitary operator is a bounded linear operator that is both an isometry and a coisometry, or, equivalently, a surjective isometry.

An equivalent definition is the following:

Definition 2. A &quot;unitary operator&quot; is a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space for which the following hold:
* is surjective, and
* preserves the inner product of the Hilbert space, . In other words, for all vectors and in we have: 
*:formula_1

The notion of isomorphism in the category of Hilbert spaces is captured if domain and range are allowed to differ in this definition. Isometries preserve Cauchy sequences; hence the completeness property of Hilbert spaces is preserved

The following, seemingly weaker, definition is also equivalent:

Definition 3. A &quot;unitary operator&quot; is a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space for which the following hold:
*the range of is dense in , and
* preserves the inner product of the Hilbert space, . In other words, for all vectors and in we have: 
*:formula_1

To see that definitions 1 and 3 are equivalent, notice that preserving the inner product implies is an isometry (thus, a bounded linear operator). The fact that has dense range ensures it has a bounded inverse . It is clear that .

Thus, unitary operators are just automorphisms of Hilbert spaces, i.e., they preserve the structure (the vector space structure, the inner product, and hence the topology) of the space on which they act. The group of all unitary operators from a given Hilbert space to itself is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Hilbert group&quot; of , denoted or .

==Examples==
* The identity function is trivially a unitary operator.
* Rotations in are the simplest nontrivial example of unitary operators. Rotations do not change the length of a vector or the angle between two vectors. This example can be expanded to . In even higher dimensions, this can be extended to the Givens rotation.
* Reflections, like the Householder transformation.
* formula_3 times a Hadamard matrix.
* In general, any operator in a Hilbert space that acts by permuting an orthonormal basis is unitary. In the finite dimensional case, such operators are the permutation matrices.
* On the vector space of complex numbers, multiplication by a number of absolute value , that is, a number of the form for , is a unitary operator. is referred to as a phase, and this multiplication is referred to as multiplication by a phase. Notice that the value of modulo does not affect the result of the multiplication, and so the independent unitary operators on are parametrized by a circle. The corresponding group, which, as a set, is the circle, is called .
* The Fourier operator is a unitary operator, i.e. the operator that performs the Fourier transform (with proper normalization). This follows from Parseval&#x27;s theorem.
* Quantum logic gates are unitary operators. Not all gates are Hermitian.
* More generally, unitary matrices are precisely the unitary operators on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, so the notion of a unitary operator is a generalization of the notion of a unitary matrix. Orthogonal matrices are the special case of unitary matrices in which all entries are real. They are the unitary operators on .
* The bilateral shift on the sequence space indexed by the integers is unitary.
* The unilateral shift (right shift) is an isometry; its conjugate (left shift) is a coisometry.
* Unitary operators are used in unitary representations.
* A unitary element is a generalization of a unitary operator. In a unital algebra, an element of the algebra is called a unitary element if , where is the multiplicative identity element.
* Any composition of the above.

==Linearity==
The linearity requirement in the definition of a unitary operator can be dropped without changing the meaning because it can be derived from linearity and positive-definiteness of the scalar product:

:formula_4

Analogously we obtain

:formula_5

==Properties==
* The spectrum of a unitary operator lies on the unit circle. That is, for any complex number in the spectrum, one has . This can be seen as a consequence of the spectral theorem for normal operators. By the theorem, is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by a Borel-measurable on , for some finite measure space . Now implies , -a.e. This shows that the essential range of , therefore the spectrum of , lies on the unit circle.
* A linear map is unitary if it is surjective and isometric. (Use Polarization identity to show the only if part.)

<text>William Evans Burton (24 September 180410 February 1860) was an English actor, playwright, theatre manager and publisher who relocated to the United States.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Born in London on 24 September 1804, Burton was the son of William George Burton (1774–1825), a printer and the author of &quot;Research into the religions of the Eastern nations as illustrative of the scriptures&quot; in 1805. Intended for a career in the church, Burton was a pupil at St. Paul&#x27;s School in London, an institution associated also with the dramatic names of Robert William Elliston and Charles Mathews. At the age of 18, in consequence of the death of his father, the youth was called to take charge of the printing office, and also to be the support of a widowed mother. His first effort was to establish a monthly magazine. The attempt was a failure, but it brought him theatrical acquaintances, and under their influence he presently drifted toward the stage.

The first step in his theatrical career, as usual, was to join an amateur dramatic society, and it is said that about this time he gave a performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot; somewhere on the Strand. In 1825 he was associated with a provincial company acting at Norwich, and elsewhere in England, and he played low comedy. His aspirations at the start were for the tragic, and it is known that late in life he still at times entertained the fancy that nature had intended him to be a tragedian. Burton was one of the funniest creatures that ever lived, but his interior nature was thoughtful and saturnine. He thought, felt, and understood tragedy, but when he came to act, he was all comedian.

At the outset of his career he led the usual life of an itinerant actor. There is a tradition that in the course of his wanderings he once played before George IV at Windsor. After several years in the provinces, he made his first London appearance in 1831 at the Pavilion Theatre as Wormwood in &quot;The Lottery Ticket&quot;, in which part he was much admired, and which he then acted there upward of fifty consecutive times. John Liston was then the reigning favourite in London (Joseph Shepherd Munden, who died in 1832, being in decadence), and next to Liston stood John Reeve, upon whom it is thought that the earlier style of Burton was in a measure founded.

In 1832 Burton obtained a chance to show his talents at the Haymarket Theatre—Liston having temporarily withdrawn—and there he played Marall to Edmund Kean as Sir Giles Overreach, and Mrs. Glover as Meg in &quot;A New Way to Pay Old Debts&quot;, a circumstance which he always remembered, and often mentioned with pride and pleasure. His talents as a writer likewise displayed themselves at an early age. In May 1833, a play from his pen, called &quot;Ellen Wareham&quot;, was first presented, and it is mentioned that this piece had the somewhat unusual fortune of being acted at five different theatres of London on the same evening. Burton went on to a large number of plays during his career.

===Relocation to the United States===
On 10 April 1823 Burton had married Elizabeth Loft, by whom in 1824 he had a son. The marriage was not a success, and partly due to this in 1834 Burton relocated to the United States, where he appeared in Philadelphia as Dr. Ollapod in &quot;The Poor Gentleman&quot;. He took a prominent place, both as actor and manager, in New York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore, the theatre which he leased in New York being renamed Burton&#x27;s Theatre. He was very successful as Captain Cuttle in John Brougham&#x27;s dramatisation of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;, and in other low comedy parts in plays from Charles Dickens&#x27;s novels.

===Publishing work===
In 1837 in Philadelphia he established the &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, of which Edgar Allan Poe was for some time the editor. His magazine was intended for a general audience, incorporating the standard fare of poetry and fiction, but had a focus on sporting life like hunting and sailing. For the September 1837 issue Burton wrote an early example of the detective story, &#x27;The Secret Cell&#x27;, detailing a London policeman&#x27;s efforts to trace an abducted girl and arrest her kidnappers. Burton likely served as a literary critic himself for the magazine. To remain competitive, the magazine included better paper, more illustrations, and higher-quality printing, making production costs high. Poe became an editor in 1839, though Burton disliked Poe&#x27;s harsh style of criticism. Even so, Poe&#x27;s responsibilities increased whenever Burton left town to perform at other venues. It was under Burton that Poe began what has since been termed the &quot;Longfellow War&quot;, with Poe using his role as critic to anonymously accuse the popular poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism. Another critic, Willis Gaylord Clark, blamed Burton for allowing these literary attacks, telling Longfellow that Burton was: &quot;a vagrant from England, who has left a wife and offspring behind him there, and plays the bigamist in &quot;this&quot; with another wife, and his whore besides; one who cannot write a paragraph in English to save his life&quot;.

Poe was fired by Burton in June 1840. Burton and Poe had a tumultuous working relationship. Burton tried selling the magazine without telling Poe, and Poe made plans to launch his own competing Philadelphia-based magazine called &quot;The Penn&quot; without mentioning it to Burton. Additionally, Burton may have written a particularly scathing negative review of Poe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; and spread rumours of his drunkenness, which Poe denied. Poe told a friend that Burton was a &quot;blackguard and a villain.&quot; Poe&#x27;s friend Joseph E. Snodgrass thought Burton&#x27;s rumour-mongering was enough for Poe to sue for slander but Poe noted his own name-calling was enough for a countersuit.

===Later life===
In late 1840, Burton sold his magazine to George Rex Graham for the price of $3,500 (one dollar for each subscriber), who transformed it into &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Burton used the money from the sale to renovate his theatre, which eventually failed. Burton went on to become the editor of the &quot;Cambridge Quarterly&quot; and the &quot;Souvenir&quot;. He also wrote several books, including a &quot;Cyclopaedia of Wit and Humour&quot; in 1857.

Burton died on 10 February 1860 in New York City. At the time of his death, he had collected a library of over 100,000 volumes, especially rich in books by and relating to William Shakespeare. He left his fortune to charity but his wife Elizabeth, from whom he had separated 26 years earlier, arrived from England to claim dower. Judgment initially went against her but after a series of appeals the Supreme Court upheld her claim, thus establishing the rights of an alien to dower in the United States.

William Evans Burton was the father of the English painter William Shakespeare Burton.

<text>James William Wallack (c. 1794–1864), commonly referred to as J. W. Wallack, was an Anglo-American actor and manager, born in London, and brother of Henry John Wallack.

==Life==

Wallack&#x27;s father was named William Wallack and his sister was named Elizabeth. His parents were comedians, who performed at the London minor playhouses and in the British provinces. His first appearance on the stage was as a child at the Surrey Theatre in London. Soon afterward he performed in juvenile characters at Drury Lane, and at the age of eighteen entered on a permanent career at the same house as Laertes in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He also acted in the British provinces and in Ireland, gradually winning his way to popularity as a useful representative of drama and comedy. In 1823 he played Victor Frankenstein in &quot;Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein&quot; at the English Opera House. In 1824, Wallack became stage manager at Drury Lane, and rose to the performance of secondary roles in tragedy. Later he played at the Haymarket Theatre, and officiated as stage manager at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre.

On the occasion of his first visit to the United States, in 1818, he played Macbeth at the Park Theatre, New York. He also played Romeo, Shylock, Coriolanus, Hamlet, and Richard III, all without making any favorable impression. But in the principal roles in &quot;The Stranger&quot;, &quot;Pizarro&quot; and &quot;The Gamester&quot; he closely copied the manner of Kemble and attracted favorable consideration. From 1818 until 1845 Wallack performed at intervals in all the principal cities of the United States. Among his roles were the chief characters in &quot;The Brigand&quot;, &quot;The Rent-Day&quot;, &quot;The Wonder&quot;, &quot;Don Cassar de Bazan&quot;, &quot;Wild Oats&quot; and the refined comedy parts of Mercutio, Jaques, and Benedick. &quot;Love&#x27;s Ritornello&quot;, as sung by him in &quot;The Brigand&quot;, was hummed from one end of the country to the other.

In 1822 Wallack met with an accident, in which his leg was fractured by the overturning of a stagecoach between New York and Philadelphia. This mishap retired him from active life for about eighteen months, and from its effect he never entirely recovered. From 1837 until its destruction by fire, Wallack conducted the New York National Theatre. There he presented a repertory of the best plays in the English language, rendered by a company such as never before had been seen in this country.

He settled permanently in New York City in 1852. In that year, he assumed management of an 1850 theatre two doors south of Broome Street on the west side of Broadway, called Brougham&#x27;s Lyceum, renaming it Wallack&#x27;s Lyceum. In 1861 he built a new Wallack&#x27;s Theatre at 13th Street and Broadway. His son opened the third Wallack&#x27;s Theatre in 1882.

Wallack was an actor of the old school. Thackeray praised his performance as Shylock, and Joseph Jefferson his Don Caesar de Bazan. As a performer he was endowed with a fine personality; his voice was highly melodious, set off by flexibility and careful elocution, and his knowledge of stage-effect was unexcelled. In refined and eccentric comedy Wallack had few superiors. Some of his roles in the romantic dramas of his own creation were entirely unequalled, and have died with him.

==Family==
Wallack married Susan Johnstone, a comic actress and the daughter of John Henry Johnstone, in 1817; she died in 1851. Together, the Wallacks had four sons. The eldest, Lester Wallack, was also a famous actor and theater manager. Wallack&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth had a daughter, Leonora Pincott, who married Alfred Wigan was a noted actor.

<text>John Johnstone Wallack (January 1, 1820, New York City – September 6, 1888, Stamford, Connecticut), was an American actor-manager and son of James William Wallack and Susan Johnstone. He used the stage name John Lester until October 5, 1858, when he first acted under the name Lester Wallack, which he retained the rest of his career.

==Biography==
He was born in New York and relocated at an early age to his parents&#x27; home in London where he was reared and educated. His mother was actress Susan Johnstone and his father was James William Wallack, a theatre producer. 

He chose a military career but became discouraged and went to Dublin where he began performed on stage. He remained for two seasons and then went to Edinburgh. Then in 1846, he appeared in London at the Haymarket Theatre under Benjamin Webster&#x27;s management. There he was seen by George H. Barrett, who had come to London to engage actors for the Broadway Theatre, in New York.

He made his American debut there in 1847, under the name of John Lester, appearing as Sir Charles Coldstream in Boucicault&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Used Up&quot;. His father&#x27;s brother, Henry Wallack, the father of James William Wallack Jr. (1818–1873), was also in the Broadway Theatre&#x27;s company. His second appearance was as Viscount de Ligny in &quot;Captain of the Guard&quot; by James Planché.

Subsequently, he performed at the Bowery Theatre, Burton&#x27;s Theatre, Niblo&#x27;s Garden and the first Wallack&#x27;s Theatre. His first appearance at the Bowery Theatre was in 1849 as &quot;Don Caesar de Bazan&quot; by Adolphe d&#x27;Ennery and Philippe Dumanoir.

He managed the second Wallack&#x27;s Theatre from 1861 (demolished in 1901), and in 1882 he opened the third at 30th Street and Broadway (demolished in 1915). Among the productions staged at the latter was Margaret Mather&#x27;s ill-fated production of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; in 1897. Another Wallack&#x27;s Theatre, at 254 West 42nd Street in New York, was named for him in 1924. 

Wallack joined The Lambs in 1875, which frequently met at Wallack&#x27;s Theater. He served as its Shepherd (president): 1878-82, 1884-88, and was one of the founders of the Actors&#x27; Fund of America.

His greatest successes were as Charles Surface, as Benedick, and especially as Elliot Grey in his own play &quot;Rosedale&quot;, and similar light comedy and romantic parts, for which his fascinating manners and handsome person well fitted him. He married a sister (d. 1909) of Sir John Millais. He wrote his own &quot;Memories of Fifty Years&quot;.

<text>Francis James Child (February 1, 1825 – September 11, 1896) was an American scholar, educator, and folklorist, best known today for his collection of English and Scottish ballads now known as the Child Ballads. Child was Boylston professor of rhetoric and oratory at Harvard University, where he produced influential editions of English poetry. In 1876 he was named Harvard&#x27;s first Professor of English, a position which allowed him to focus on academic research. It was during this time that he began work on the Child Ballads.

The Child Ballads were published in five volumes between 1882 and 1898. While Child was primarily a literary scholar with little interest in the music of the ballads, his work became a major contribution to the study of English-language folk music.

==Biography==
Francis James Child was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His lifelong friend, scholar and social reformer Charles Eliot Norton, described Child&#x27;s father, a sailmaker, as &quot;one of that class of intelligent and independent mechanics [i.e., skilled craftsmen], which has had a large share of developing the character of our democratic community, as of old the same class had in Athens or in Florence.&quot; The family was poor, but thanks to the city of Boston&#x27;s system of free public schools, the boy was educated at the Boston&#x27;s grammar schools and The English High School. There his brilliance came to the attention of the principal of the Boston Latin School, Epes Sargent Dixwell, who saw to it that the promising youngster was furnished with a scholarship to attend Harvard University.

At Harvard, &quot;Frank&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Stubby&quot; on account of his short stature) excelled in all classes and also read widely outside his studies for his own pleasure. Although shy and diffident on account of his working-class origins, he was soon recognized as &quot;the best writer, best speaker, best mathematician, the most accomplished person in knowledge of general literature&quot;, and he became extremely popular with his classmates. He graduated in 1846, topping his class in all subjects and was chosen Class Orator by his graduating class (of sixty), who received his valedictory speech with &quot;tumultuous applause&quot;. Upon graduation Child was appointed tutor in mathematics at Harvard and in 1848 was transferred to a tutorship in history, political economy, and English literature.

In 1848, Child published a critically annotated edition (the first of the kind to be produced in America) of &quot;Four Old Plays&quot; of the early English Renaissance. Though there were no graduate schools in America at the time, a loan from a benefactor, Jonathan I. Bowditch, to whom the book was dedicated, enabled Child to take a leave of absence from his teaching duties to pursue his studies in Germany. There Child studied English drama and Germanic philology at the University of Göttingen, which conferred on him an honorary doctorate, and at Humboldt University, Berlin, where he heard lectures by the linguists Grimm and was much influenced by them.

In 1851, at the age of 26, Child succeeded Edward T. Channing as Harvard&#x27;s Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory, a position he held until Adams Sherman Hill was appointed to the professorship in 1876. Harvard had at that time an enrollment of 382 undergraduates and a faculty of 14, including the president of the university, who was then James Walker.

As a mathematician, wrote folklore scholar David E. Bynum, Child came to his interest &quot;in what he variously called &#x27;popular&#x27;, &#x27;primitive&#x27;, or &#x27;traditional&#x27; balladry&#x27;&quot; (that is, in oral literature, then deemed &quot;primitive&quot; because its stylistic features antedate the invention of writing) not by accident &quot;but by force of logic&quot;:
Child well understood how indispensable good writing and good speaking are to civilization, or as many would now prefer to say, to society. For him, writing and speaking were not only the practical means by which men share useful information, but also the means whereby they formulate and share values, including the higher order of values that give meaning to life and purpose to human activities of all sorts. Concerned as he thus so greatly was with rhetoric, oratory, and the motives of those mental disciplines, Child was inevitably drawn into pondering the essential differences between speech and writing, and to searching for the origins of thoughtful expression in English.

During the twenty-five years Child was Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard he undertook general editorial supervision of the publication of a 130-volume collection of the works of the British poets, many not previously generally available to the reading public, which began appearing 1853. The volumes on the works of Edmund Spenser (five volumes, Boston, 1855) and the &quot;English and Scottish Ballads&quot; (in eight small volumes, Boston, 1857–1858), Child edited himself. Child planned a critical edition of the works of Chaucer, as well. He soon realized that this could not be done, however, since only one early (and faulty) text was available. He therefore wrote a treatise, blandly titled &quot;Observations on the Language of Chaucer&quot;, published in the &quot;Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&quot; (1863), intended to make such an edition possible.

Child&#x27;s linguistic researches are largely responsible for how Chaucerian grammar, pronunciation, and scansion are now generally understood.

Child&#x27;s largest undertaking, however, grew out of the original &quot;English and Scottish Ballads&quot; volume in his &quot;British Poets&quot; series. The material for this volume was mostly derived from texts in previously published books. In compiling this work he realized that the folio manuscript of Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques&quot;, from which most of these texts were drawn, was not available for public inspection, and he set about to remedy this situation. In the 1860s he campaigned energetically for public support to enable the Early English Text Society, founded by philologist Frederick James Furnivall, to obtain a copy of Percy&#x27;s Folio and publish it, which they did in 1868. Child and Furnivall then went on to found The Ballad Society, with a view to publishing other important early ballad collections, such as that of Samuel Pepys.

In 1876, University of California President Daniel Coit Gilman offered Child a research professorship at the newly established Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, which Gilman was in the process of organizing. Johns Hopkins was the first American university conceived on the German research model initiated by Wilhelm von Humboldt and divided into departments representing &quot;the branches of knowledge&quot;, with elective subjects and a graduate school dedicated to advanced studies. In order to retain him, Harvard&#x27;s president Charles William Eliot created the title of &quot;Professor of English&quot; especially for Child, freeing him from supervising oral recitations and correcting composition papers so that he could have more time for research. Thereafter, Child devoted himself to the comparative study of British vernacular ballads, using methods adopted from historical comparative philology to arrive at the earliest attested versions.

Child believed that folk ballads came from a more democratic time in the past when society was not so rigidly segregated into classes, and the &quot;true voice&quot; of the people could therefore be heard. He conceived &quot;the people&quot; as comprising all the classes of society, rich, middle, and poor, and not only those engaged in manual labor as Marxists sometimes use the word. Although Child concentrated his collections on manuscript texts with a view of determining their chronology, he also gave a sedulous but conservative hearing to popular versions still surviving. Child carried his investigations into the ballads of languages other than English, engaging in extensive international correspondence on the subject with colleagues abroad, primarily with the Danish literary historian and ethnographer Svend Grundtvig, whose monumental twelve-volume compilation of Danish ballads, &quot;Danmarks gamle Folkeviser&quot;, vols. 1–12 (Copenhagen, 1853), was the model for Child&#x27;s resulting canonical five-volume edition of some 305 English and Scottish ballads and their numerous variants. 

Since the ballads were known to have been a pan-European, Turkish, and North African phenomenon, Child and Grundtvig also consulted with numerous scholars in other parts of the world, such as the Sicilian physician, folklorist, and ethnographer Giuseppe Pitrè. Professor Child served two terms as president, in 1888 and 1889, of the American Folklore Society, which was founded with the mission of collecting and preserving African-American and Native American folklore equally that of European derivation.

Worked and overworked to the last, he died in Boston after completing his task – apart from a planned general introduction and bibliography. A biographical introduction was prefixed to the work by his student and successor, George Lyman Kittredge.

Child added to the Harvard University Library one of the largest folklore collections in existence. Kittredge, who succeeded him as Professor of English literature and modern languages at Harvard, considered himself the custodian of Child&#x27;s scholarly legacy. Kittredge became president of the American Folklore Society in 1904.

All the earlier, printed sources known to Child (&#x27;The Child Ballads&#x27;), were subsumed, and progressed upon in number and research by Steve Roud, in the Roud Folk Song Index.

He is buried in the cemetery in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, in the &quot;Sedgwick Pie&quot;, since (like his good friend Charles Eliot Norton), he had married into the Sedgwick family.

==&quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot;==
Child&#x27;s monumental final collection was published as &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; in 1882–1898, at first in ten parts (the tenth, posthumously) and then in five quarto volumes, and for a long time was the authoritative treasury of their subject. The &quot;English&quot; and &quot;Scottish&quot; of the title notwithstanding, it was an international piece of research, with references that include thirty different language sources.

A commemorative article in the 2006 edition of the &quot;Harvard Magazine&quot; states:Child&#x27;s enthusiasm and erudition shine throughout his systematic attempt to set the British ballad tradition in context with others, whether Danish, Serbian, or Turkish. He made no attempt to conceal or apologize for the sexuality, theatrical violence, and ill-concealed paganism of many ballads, but it is characteristic of the man that in his introduction to &quot;Hugh of Lincoln,&quot; an ancient work about the purported murder of a Christian child by a Jew, he wrote, &quot;And these pretended child-murders, with their horrible consequences, are only a part of the persecution which, with all moderation, may be rubricated as the most disgraceful chapter in the history of the human race.&quot;

Since Child did not live to complete the planned introduction to his work which was to have explained his methodology, it has sometimes been alleged his selection was arbitrary and based purely on personal taste. The most recent edition of the ballads, however, published in 2002, now includes Child&#x27;s rediscovered essay, &quot;Ballad Poetry,&quot; which he had published anonymously in 1874. Reviewing the new edition, Ian Olson notes that the rediscovered essay:gives considerable insight into Child&#x27;s thinking after he had published his &quot;first go&quot; of English and Scottish Ballads in 1857-59 and was in the process of researching and reconsidering his last great work. It may not be Child&#x27;s &quot;final statement&quot; that we all wish he had lived to make, but it comes close in many ways, and nicely complements the original Introduction to 1880s English and Scottish Popular Ballads made by Child&#x27;s successor, George Lyman Kittredge (retained in this volume).

Owing to the indelicate nature of their theme, certain traditional ballads such as The Crabfish were deliberately excluded from this work. For a listing of all the Child ballad types, and links to more information on each individual type, see List of the Child Ballads.

<text>In physics, dynamics or classical dynamics is the study of forces and their effect on motion.
It is a branch of classical mechanics, along with &quot;statics&quot; and &quot;kinematics&quot;.
The &quot;fundamental principle of dynamics&quot; is linked to Newton&#x27;s second law.

==Subdivisions==

===Rigid bodies===
===Fluids===
==Applications==

Classical dynamics finds many applications:
* &quot;Aerodynamics&quot;, the study of the motion of air

<text>In music, the dynamics of a piece are the variation in loudness between notes or phrases. Dynamics are indicated by specific musical notation, often in some detail. However, dynamics markings require interpretation by the performer depending on the musical context: a specific marking may correspond to a different volume between pieces or even sections of one piece. The execution of dynamics also extends beyond loudness to include changes in timbre and sometimes tempo rubato.

==Purpose and interpretation==

Dynamics are one of the expressive elements of music. Used effectively, dynamics help musicians sustain variety and interest in a musical performance, and communicate a particular emotional state or feeling.

Dynamic markings are always relative. (&quot;piano&quot; - &quot;soft&quot;) never indicates a precise level of loudness; it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be considerably quieter than (&quot;forte&quot; - &quot;loud&quot;). There are many factors affecting the interpretation of a dynamic marking. For instance, the middle of a musical phrase will normally be played louder than the beginning or end, to ensure the phrase is properly shaped, even where a passage is marked throughout. Similarly, in multi-part music, some voices will naturally be played louder than others, for instance, to emphasize the melody and the bass line, even if a whole passage is marked at one dynamic level. Some instruments are naturally louder than others – for instance, a tuba playing &quot;mezzo-piano&quot; will likely be louder than a guitar playing &quot;forte&quot;, while a high-pitched instrument like the piccolo playing in its upper register can sound loud even when its actual decibel level is lower than that of other instruments.

==Dynamic markings==

The two basic dynamic indications in music are:
* or &quot;piano&quot;, meaning &quot;soft or quiet&quot;.
* or &quot;forte&quot;, meaning &quot;loud or strong&quot;.

More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by:
* , standing for &quot;mezzo-piano&quot;, meaning &quot;moderately quiet&quot;.
* , standing for &quot;mezzo-forte&quot;, meaning &quot;moderately loud&quot;.
* &quot;&quot;, standing for &quot;più piano&quot; and meaning &quot;quieter&quot;. 
* &quot;&quot;, standing for &quot;più forte&quot; and meaning &quot;louder&quot;. 

Use of up to three consecutive s or s is also common:
* , standing for &quot;pianissimo&quot; and meaning &quot;very quiet&quot;.
* , standing for &quot;fortissimo&quot; and meaning &quot;very loud&quot;.
* (&quot;triple &quot;piano&quot;&quot;), standing for &quot;pianississimo&quot; or &quot;piano pianissimo&quot; and meaning &quot;very very quiet&quot;.
* (&quot;triple &quot;forte&quot;&quot;), standing for &quot;fortississimo&quot; or &quot;forte fortissimo&quot; and meaning &quot;very very loud&quot;.
There are additional special markings that are not very common:
* or , standing for &quot;sforzando&quot; and meaning &quot;suddenly very loud&quot;, which only applies to a given beat.
* or , standing for &quot;rinforzando&quot; and meaning &quot;reinforced&quot;, which refers to a sudden increase in volume that only applies to a given phrase.
* or , standing for &quot;niente&quot; and meaning &quot;nothing&quot;, which refers to silence; it is generally used in combination with other markings for special effect.

===Changes===

Three Italian words are used to show gradual changes in volume:

* crescendo (abbreviated &quot;cresc.&quot;) translates as &quot;increasing&quot; (literally &quot;growing&quot;)
* decrescendo (abbreviated to &quot;decresc.&quot;) translates as &quot;decreasing&quot;.
* diminuendo (abbreviated &quot;dim.&quot;) translates as &quot;diminishing&quot;.

Dynamic changes can be indicated by angled symbols. A crescendo symbol consists of two lines that open to the right (); a decrescendo symbol starts open on the left and closes toward the right (). These symbols are sometimes referred to as hairpins or wedges. The following notation indicates music starting moderately strong, then becoming gradually stronger and then gradually quieter:

Hairpins are typically positioned below the staff (or between the two staves in a grand staff), though they may appear above, especially in vocal music or when a single performer plays multiple melody lines. They denote dynamic changes over a short duration (up to a few bars), whereas &quot;cresc.&quot;, &quot;decresc.&quot;, and &quot;dim.&quot; signify more gradual changes. Word directions can be extended with dashes to indicate the temporal span of the change, which can extend across multiple pages. The term &quot;morendo&quot; (&quot;dying&quot;) may also denote a gradual reduction in both dynamics and tempo.

For pronounced dynamic shifts, &quot;cresc. molto&quot; and &quot;dim. molto&quot; are commonly used, with &quot;molto&quot; meaning &quot;much&quot;. Conversely, &quot;poco cresc.&quot; and &quot;poco dim.&quot; indicate gentler changes, with &quot;poco&quot; translating to &quot;a little&quot;, or alternatively &quot;poco a poco&quot; meaning &quot;little by little&quot;.

Sudden dynamic changes are often indicated by prefixing or suffixing &quot;subito&quot; (meaning &quot;suddenly&quot;) to the new dynamic notation. &quot;Subito piano&quot; (abbreviated as &#x27; or ) (&quot;suddenly soft&quot;) implies a quick, almost abrupt reduction in volume to around the range, often employed to subvert listener expectations, signaling a more intimate expression. Likewise, &quot;subito&quot; can mark sudden increases in volume, as in &#x27; or ) (&quot;suddenly loud&quot;).
Accented notes are generally marked with an &quot;accent&quot; sign &gt; placed above or below the note, emphasizing the attack relative to the prevailing dynamics. A sharper and briefer emphasis is denoted with a &quot;marcato&quot; mark ^ above the note. If a specific emphasis is required, variations of &quot;forzando&quot;/&quot;forzato&quot;, or &quot;fortepiano&quot; can be used.

&quot;forzando&quot;/&quot;forzato&quot; signifies a forceful accent, abbreviated as . To enhance the effect, &quot;subito&quot; often precedes it as (&quot;subito forzato/forzando&quot;, &quot;sforzando&quot;/&quot;sforzato&quot;). The interpretation and execution of these markings are at the performer&#x27;s discretion, with &quot;forzato/forzando&quot; typically seen as a variation of &quot;marcato&quot; and &quot;subito forzando/forzato&quot; as a &quot;marcato&quot; with added &quot;tenuto&quot;.

The fortepiano notation denotes a &quot;forte&quot; followed immediately by &quot;piano&quot;. Contrastingly, abbreviates &quot;poco forte&quot;, translating to &quot;a little loud&quot;, but according to Brahms, implies &quot;a forte character with a piano sound&quot;, although rarely used due to potential confusion with &quot;pianoforte&quot;.

Messa di voce is a singing technique and musical ornament on a single pitch while executing a crescendo and diminuendo.

===Extreme dynamic markings===
While the typical range of dynamic markings is from to , some pieces use additional markings of further emphasis. Extreme dynamic markings imply either a very large dynamic range or very small differences of loudness within a normal range. This kind of usage is most common in orchestral works from the late 19th century onward. Generally, these markings are supported by the orchestration of the work, with heavy &quot;forte&quot; passages brought to life by having many loud instruments like brass and percussion playing at once.

* In Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, occurs twice in &quot;Mars&quot; and once in &quot;Uranus&quot;, often punctuated by organ.
* In Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird Suite&quot;, is marked for the strings and woodwinds at the end of the Finale.
* Tchaikovsky marks a bassoon solo (6 s) in his &quot;Pathétique&quot; Symphony and uses in passages of his &quot;1812 Overture&quot; and his Fifth Symphony. 
* The baritone passage &quot;Era la notte&quot; from Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Otello&quot; uses , though the same spot is marked in the full score.
* Sergei Rachmaninoff uses in his Prelude in C, Op. 3 No. 2.
* Gustav Mahler, in the third movement of his Seventh Symphony, gives the celli and basses a marking of (5 s), along with a footnote directing &#x27;pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood&#x27;.
* On the other extreme, Carl Nielsen, in the second movement of his Fifth Symphony, marked a passage for woodwinds a diminuendo to (5 s).΄
* Brian Ferneyhough, in his &quot;Lemma-Icon-Epigram&quot;, uses (6 s).
* Giuseppe Verdi, in Scene 5 (Act II from his opera Otello), uses (7 s).
* György Ligeti uses extreme dynamics in his music: the Cello Concerto begins with a passage marked (8 s), in his Piano Études Étude No. 9 (&quot;Vertige&quot;) ends with a diminuendo to (8 s), while Étude No. 13 (&quot;L&#x27;Escalier du Diable&quot;) contains a passage marked (6 s) that progresses to a (8 s) and his opera &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot; has (10 s) with a stroke of the hammer.
==History==
&quot;On Music&quot;, one of the &quot;Moralia&quot; attributed to the philosopher Plutarch in the first century AD, suggests that ancient Greek musical performance included dynamic transitions – though dynamics receive far less attention in the text than does rhythm or harmony.

The Renaissance composer Giovanni Gabrieli was one of the first to indicate dynamics in music notation. However, much of the use of dynamics in early Baroque music remained implicit and was achieved through a practice called &quot;raddoppio&quot; (&quot;doubling&quot;) and later &quot;ripieno&quot; (&quot;filling&quot;), which consisted of creating a contrast between a small number of elements and then a larger number of elements (usually in a ratio of 2:1 or more) to increase the mass of sound. This practice was pivotal to the structuring of instrumental forms such as the concerto grosso and the solo concerto, where a few or one instrument, supported by harmonic basso continuo instruments (organ, lute, theorbo, harpsichord, lirone, and low register strings, such as cello or viola da gamba, often used together) variously alternate or join to create greater contrasts. This practice is usually called t&quot;erraced dynamics&quot;, i.e. the alternation of &quot;piano&quot; and &quot;forte&quot;. 

Later baroque musicians, such as Antonio Vivaldi, tended to use more varied dynamics. J.S. Bach used some dynamic terms, including &quot;forte&quot;, &quot;piano&quot;, &quot;più piano&quot;, and &quot;pianissimo&quot; (although written out as full words), and in some cases it may be that was considered to mean &quot;pianissimo&quot; in this period. In 1752, Johann Joachim Quantz wrote that &quot;Light and shade must be constantly introduced ... by the incessant interchange of loud and soft.&quot; In addition to this, the harpsichord in fact becomes louder or softer depending on the thickness of the musical texture (four notes are louder than two). 

In the Romantic period, composers greatly expanded the vocabulary for describing dynamic changes in their scores. Where Haydn and Mozart specified six levels ( to ), Beethoven used also and (the latter less frequently), and Brahms used a range of terms to describe the dynamics he wanted. In the slow movement of Brahms&#x27;s trio for violin, horn and piano (Opus 40), he uses the expressions , &quot;molto piano&quot;, and &quot;quasi niente&quot; to express different qualities of quiet. Many Romantic and later composers added &#x27; and &#x27;, making for a total of ten levels between and .

An example of how effective contrasting dynamics can be may be found in the overture to Smetana’s opera &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;. The fast scurrying quavers played pianissimo by the second violins form a sharply differentiated background to the incisive thematic statement played fortissimo by the firsts.

== Interpretation by notation programs ==
In some music notation programs, there are default MIDI key velocity values associated with these indications, but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed. These defaults are listed in the following table for some applications, including Apple&#x27;s Logic Pro 9 (2009–2013), Avid&#x27;s Sibelius 5 (2007–2009), musescore.org&#x27;s MuseScore 3.0 (2019), MakeMusic&#x27;s Finale 26 (2018-2021), and Musitek&#x27;s SmartScore X2 Pro (2016) and 64 Pro. (2021). MIDI specifies the range of key velocities as an integer between 0 and 127:

The velocity effect on volume depends on the particular instrument. For instance, a grand piano has a much greater volume range than a recorder.

== Relation to audio dynamics ==
The introduction of modern recording techniques has provided alternative ways to control the dynamics of music. Dynamic range compression is used to control the dynamic range of a recording, or a single instrument. This can affect loudness variations, both at the micro- and macro scale. In many contexts, the meaning of the term &quot;dynamics&quot; is therefore not immediately clear. To distinguish between the different aspects of dynamics, the term &quot;performed dynamics&quot; can be used to refer to the aspects of music dynamics that is controlled exclusively by the performer.

<text>The University of the Cumberlands is a private Christian university in Williamsburg, Kentucky, United States. Over 20,000 students are enrolled at the university.

==History==
University of the Cumberlands, first called Williamsburg Institute, was founded on January 7, 1889. At the 1887 annual meeting of the Mount Zion Association, representatives from 18 eastern Kentucky Baptist churches discussed plans to provide higher education in the Kentucky mountains. The Kentucky state legislature incorporated the college on April 6, 1888. In 1907, the school bought the three buildings of Highland College, and in 1913, Williamsburg Institute&#x27;s name was changed to Cumberland College. The name reflected the institution&#x27;s location along the Cumberland River and its proximity to Cumberland Falls and the Cumberland Gap.

The institution was previously affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, and its mission has been to educate and prepare leaders for service to the greater community. Based on formerly being controlled by the Kentucky Baptist Convention and being bound by its policies, the university requested and received exemptions from Title IX in the areas of &quot;admissions, recruitment, education programs or activities, and employment&quot;, allowing it to discriminate in those fields based on its views regarding &quot;marriage, sex outside of marriage, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, and abortion.&quot; University of the Cumberlands sought, and received, a dissolution with the Kentucky Baptist Convention during the annual convention on November 12, 2018. The university described itself as a &quot;private Baptist university&quot; in its 2021 tax filings and marketed itself as an institution &quot;grounded in Christian principles&quot; as of the 2023–2024 academic year.

Although founded as a senior college, Cumberland College officially became a junior college in 1918. The college received its first accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) in 1931. In 1956, the college&#x27;s board of trustees began restoring the college to senior college status. The junior year was added in 1959–60, and the senior year in 1960–1961. SACS granted initial accreditation to the institution as a senior college in December 1964.

Cumberland College received authority to award its first graduate degree, the Master of Arts in Education (MAED), on April 6, 1988. Graduate education has since become an integral part of the institution. In 2005, the institution received authorization from SACS to offer the Master of Arts in Teaching degree (MAT). This action was followed in 2006 with permission from the SACS Commission on Colleges to offer both the MAED and MAT degrees entirely online. More recently, in 2008, the commission also authorized granting the MBA degree, the Ed.S. degree, and the institution&#x27;s first doctoral degree, an Ed.D. in Educational Leadership. Master&#x27;s programs in Professional Counseling and Physician Assistant Studies were approved by SACS in 2009, and the Master of Arts in Christian Studies in 2010.

In 2004 then-president Larry Cockrum was caught in an academic scandal because he was awarded a fake degree from Crescent City Christian College. The incident occurred while Cockrum was employed at College of the Ozarks. The professor who questioned this degree was fired, while Larry Cockrum was allowed to resign. Cockrum later received a Ph.D. in higher education administration from Vanderbilt University and a post-graduate certification from Harvard University.

The following year, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) censured the university, finding that then-President James Taylor coerced Professor Robert Day into resigning because he had opposed Taylor&#x27;s proposed staff layoffs on an off-campus website. The AAUP concluded that &quot;The policies of Cumberland College, including the grievance procedure, do not provide for faculty hearings of any kind. College policies and practices preclude any effective faculty role in academic governance and contribute to an atmosphere that stifles the freedom of faculty to question and criticize administrative decisions and actions.&quot; The AAUP noted that current and former faculty members &quot;do not feel free to address topics of college concern in any forum&quot; and &quot;described a climate of fear about what faculty members may say and do, a fear based on what they know or have been told has happened to others&quot;. Those interviewed &quot;expressed a particular fear that criticizing the administration and its operation of the college could place a faculty member&#x27;s appointment in jeopardy&quot;.

On July 1, 2005, the institution&#x27;s trustees changed the institution&#x27;s name to the University of the Cumberlands.

Ten presidents have led the college, including William James Johnson; E. E. Wood; John Newton Prestridge; Gorman Jones, acting president; A. R. Evans, acting president; Charles William Elsey; James Lloyd Creech; J. M. Boswell; James H. Taylor and Larry L. Cockrum.

On October 3, 2014, university President James Taylor announced that then-Vice President for Academic Affairs Larry Cockrum would take over day-to-day operations of the university after the board of trustees meeting on October 15, 2014. Taylor also announced his retirement as president effective October 15, 2015, with the recommendation that Cockrum be named university president effective October 16, 2015. On that date, Taylor would assume the honorary title of university chancellor. The board of trustees officially approved the succession plan on October 15, 2014, giving Cockrum a seven-year contract and the title of Chief Executive Officer &amp; President-Elect. The board of trustees, in a unanimous vote, officially named Cockrum university president on October 15, 2015. That same year, the university was granted an exception to Title IX, which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.

Notable alumni include two governors, five military generals, and five college and university presidents.

===Beliefs and policies on homosexuality===
The university&#x27;s beliefs about and policies on homosexuality have proven controversial on many occasions. In 2006, the Kentucky state budget included $10 million of state debt to construct a pharmacy building on the university&#x27;s Whitley County campus. Additionally, $1 million for scholarships for the pharmacy program were included. The $10 million building was to be funded out of a $100 million pool of money titled the &quot;infrastructure for economic development fund for coal-producing counties.&quot; Money to repay the bond issuance would come from coal severance taxes. The Kentucky Fairness Alliance asked Governor Ernie Fletcher to veto the $11 million that state lawmakers approved for a planned pharmacy school. A gay Kentucky State Senator, Ernesto Scorsone, has indicated that he would oppose spending the funds already allocated for a new pharmacy school for the university based on the Johnson situation, stating &quot;We should not be budgeting bigotry.&quot; &quot;If the University of the Cumberlands does not change its policies and practices, we will have a state benefit that is only available to heterosexuals,&quot; Scorsone said. An additional complication was that the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, the accrediting agency for all American pharmacy schools, explicitly prohibits discrimination against gays. Its guideline stated that approved schools must have a policy on student affairs, including admissions and progression, that assures non-discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, lifestyle, national origin, or disability. As of July 1, 2007, this was revised to include the phrase &quot;sexual orientation.&quot;

That same year, undergraduate student Jason Johnson of Lexington, Kentucky was forced to withdraw from the university after mentioning that he is gay on the social networking site MySpace.com. Then-university president James H. Taylor said in a written statement, &quot;At University of the Cumberlands, we hold students to a higher standard than does society in general...University of the Cumberlands isn&#x27;t for everyone. We tell prospective students about our high standards before they come.&quot; The student handbook, as revised in 2005, states that students can be removed from campus for participating in pre-marital sex or promoting homosexuality — a policy which Johnson&#x27;s attorney alleged was added after Johnson decided to go to school at UC. A week and a half after initially withdrawing from the university, Johnson&#x27;s attorney and the university reached a settlement allowing Johnson to complete his coursework for the semester and restoring his previous grades rather than downgrading them to failing. The university agreed to not report to other universities that Johnson was expelled. In addition, Johnson waived his right to sue the university, although he retained his right to file a grievance with the Department of Education or the Southern Association for Colleges and Schools.

In 2007, the pro-Gay and Lesbian rights group Soulforce brought its 2007 Equality Ride to Cumberlands&#x27; campus. According to the group&#x27;s website, &quot;through dialogue with administrators, faculty and students, the young activists of the 2007 Equality Ride will make clear the harmful effects of the false notion that homosexuality is a &#x27;sickness and a sin.&#x27; To make public their case for equality, the young activists on the Equality Ride will hold vigils, Bible studies, class discussions, community forums, and press conferences.&quot;

According to the university, an offer was extended to the group to be located in the middle level of the Boswell Campus Center, but Soulforce rejected those terms. However, according to Soulforce, an offer from the university was quickly withdrawn because of a miscommunication and the university later refused to agree to terms in writing. Two University of the Cumberlands students were arrested by Williamsburg police on a charge of failure to disperse, along with a member of the Soulforce group, for trespassing and failure to disperse when they stopped on the sidewalk of Main Street, which runs through the campus.

The college was granted an exception to Title IX in 2015 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.

<text>Southampton is an unincorporated community located in Upper Southampton Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

==Geography==
Southampton is 18 miles north, from the center of Philadelphia. Its ZIP Code is 18966. Portions of this ZIP Code can also be addressed as Churchville or Holland.

The town is located in the lower central part of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and is directly bordered by Montgomery County to the west. It lies within the Townships of Upper Southampton and Northampton.

Upper Southampton Township is part of the Centennial School District, and is served by William Tennent High School, located in nearby Warminster. Northampton Township is part of the Council Rock School District. Most of Northampton Township is served by Council Rock High School South, located within Southampton (addressed as Holland), while some students are zoned to Council Rock High School North in nearby Newtown Township. Students in both districts may also attend Middle Bucks Institute of Technology, a part time vocational school in nearby Jamison.

==History==
Southampton, Pennsylvania is a namesake of Southampton, England, from where the followers of William Penn set sail to the Province of Pennsylvania. By 1685, Southampton was recognized by the Provincial Council as a township, and the lands within its borders had been allocated to thirteen original purchasers: John Luff, John Martin, Robert Pressmore, Richard Wood, John Jones, Mark Betres, John Swift, Enoch Flowers, Joseph Jones, Thomas Groom, Robert Marsh, Thomas Hould and John Gilbert, whose tracts were delineated on a &quot;Map of the Improved Part of the Province of Pennsylvania&quot;, drafted by Thomas Holme, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Surveyor General.

Southampton&#x27;s boundaries at that time extended eastward to Bensalem, and it was not until 1929 that the township was divided into &quot;Upper Southampton&quot; and &quot;Lower Southampton&quot;. Its immediate bordering towns are now Feasterville, Huntingdon Valley, Warminster, and Churchville.

In order to ensure peaceful coexistence with the Indians residing in this region, Penn purchased the land with wampum and other valuable commodities including items of clothing, fish hooks, axes, knives and other useful tools. The area between the Pennypack and Neshaminy Creeks, encompassing Southampton Township, was conveyed by the Lenni-Lenape Chief Tamanend to William Penn by Deed dated June 23, 1683.

Many of the first English settlers were Quakers who fled religious persecution, and it was a group of dissident Quakers who joined with members of the Pennepek Baptist Church (a.k.a. Lower Dublin) to form the Southampton Baptist Church, which was constituted in 1746. Dutch colonists arrived in Southampton in the 18th century – the Vandikes, Vansandts, Vanartsdalens, Cornells, Krewsons and Hogelands – who migrated south from Long Island, New York and settled in Smoketown, later to be called Churchville after the North and Southampton Reformed Church erected on Bristol Road. 
The churchyards adjacent to the Southampton Baptist and North and Southampton Reformed Churches contain graves of patriots who fought in the Revolutionary War.

Farming was the way of life for most Southampton residents throughout the 18th and 19th Centuries, and roads were constructed from farm to mill, to market and to church. Second Street Pike was the thoroughfare used to carry produce by horse and wagon to the markets in Philadelphia. In the mid-19th century the villages of Davisville, Churchville, and Southamptonville (formerly &quot;Fetter&#x27;s Corner&quot;) sprouted at the various crossroads in the township, and Second Street Pike became a toll road.

In 1785 inventor John Fitch was living in Warminster and tested a 23&quot; model of a steamboat in a small stream on his friend Joseph Longstreth’s property, behind the current General Davis House on Street Road, on the western end of what is now Upper Southampton Township. The steamboat is memorialized on Upper Southampton Township&#x27;s seal.

The railroad arrived in the 1870s and brought with it many changes. &quot;Southamptonville&quot; was shortened to Southampton, and farmers now had a faster and more efficient way to market their milk and produce. Tradesmen and craftsmen opened shops along Second Street Pike, and residents began commuting into Philadelphia.

Changes continued through the 20th Century. Electricity and telephone lines were installed, and Street Road has been widened (1969–1970) and a railroad overpass constructed, necessitating the removal and/or demolition of the toll house, several shops and residences. 
Public education began in the mid-19th Century and one-room schoolhouses once stood at Street Road and Gravel Hill, and on County Line Road just west of Buck Road. Southamptonville&#x27;s former one-room schoolhouse has been enlarged to such an extent that it is no longer recognizable as such, but stands in its original location on the south side of Street Road near the railroad overpass. The Original &quot;Southampton High School&quot; was later converted and expanded into Shelmire Elementary School (now First Children Academy) when the new Centennial School District&#x27;s William Tennent High School was built in 1953.

The first public school in the village of Davisville, known as the Davisville Seminary, remains on its original site on the South Side of Street Road – next to the Dairy Queen. The Seminary was used in more recent times as an overflow classroom for the &quot;stone school&quot; (C.H.I. Institute).

Upper Southampton Township has embraced industry and development, but retains a certain small-town feeling despite rapid growth in the post-war years, and again in the 1980s and 1990s.

<text>Sarnath (also referred to as Deer Park, Sarangnath, Isispatana, Rishipattana, Migadaya, or Mrigadava) is a town located northeast of Varanasi, near the confluence of the Ganges and the Varuna rivers in Uttar Pradesh, India. According to the &quot;Lalitavistara&quot; sutra, the Gautama Buddha chose &quot;Deer Park by the Hill of the Fallen Sages, outside of Varanasi&quot; for the location of his first teachings of Buddhism, known as the Dhammacakkappavattana sutra, after he attained enlightenment
 at Bodh Gaya. It is one of eight most important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists, and has been nominated to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Sarnath is also where the Buddhist &quot;sangha&quot; first came into existence, as a result of the first teaching given to the Buddha&#x27;s first five disciples Kaundinya, Assaji, Bhaddiya, Vappa and Mahanama, known as &quot;The First Turning of the Wheel of Dharma&quot;. This teaching occurred circa 528 BCE when the Buddha was approximately 35 years of age. 

Several sources state that the name Sarnath is derived from &quot;Saranganath&quot; that translates as, “Lord of the Deer”. According to Buddhist history, during the local king&#x27;s hunting trip, a male deer (buck) offered to sacrifice himself to save the life of a female deer (doe) that the king was aiming to kill. Impressed, the king then declared his park would thereafter be a deer sanctuary.

According to the &quot;Mahaparinibbana Sutta&quot; (&quot;Sutta&quot; 16 of the &quot;Digha Nikaya&quot;), the Buddha mentioned Sarnath as one of the four places of pilgrimage his devout followers should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence. The other three sites are Lumbini (the traditional birthplace of the Buddha), Bodh Gaya (where Buddha achieved enlightenment), and Kushinagar (where the Buddha attained &quot;parinirvana&quot;).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Sarnath&quot; derives from the Sanskrit word (or &quot;Sārangnāth&quot; in the Pali language), which translates to &quot;Lord of the Deer&quot; in the English language. The name refers to an ancient Buddhist legend, in which the Bodhisattva was a deer and offered his life to a king instead of the doe the king was planning to kill. 

The king was so moved that he created the park as a deer sanctuary. The term for &quot;deer park&quot; is in Sanskrit, or &quot;Miga-dāya&quot; in the Pali language.

&quot;Isipatana&quot; is another name used to refer to Sarnath in Pali, the language of the Pali Canon. This name corresponds to the name in the Sanskrit language.
The terms &quot;isi&quot; (Pali) and (Sanskrit) refer to an accomplished and enlightened person. &quot;Isipatana&quot; and therefore translate to &quot;the place where holy men descended&quot;, or &quot;the hill of the fallen sages&quot;.

==History==
===5th century BCE – 6th century CE===
Buddhism flourished in Sarnath during the second urbanisation (c. 600 – 200 BCE, from the time of the Mahajanapadas through the Nanda and Maurya periods), in part because of patronage from kings and wealthy merchants based in Varanasi. By the 3rd century CE, Sarnath had become an important centre for the Sammatiya school of Buddhism (one of the early Buddhist schools), as well as for art and architecture. 

However, the presence of images of Heruka and Tara indicate that Vajrayana Buddhism was (at a later time) also practised here. Also, images of Hindu gods as Shiva and Brahma were found at the site, and a Jain temple was located very close to the Dhamek Stupa.

Buddhism further expanded in India during the Gupta (4th to 6th centuries) period. Faxian was a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled extensively throughout northern India from 400–411 CE. In his description of Sarnath, he mentioned seeing four large towers and two viharas with monks residing in them.

===6th century – 8th century===
The influence of Buddhism continued to grow during the Later Gupta (6th–8th centuries). When Xuanzang visited Sarnath around 640 CE, he reported seeing hundreds of small shrines and votive stupas, and a vihara some in height containing a large statue of the Buddha. Xuanzang also wrote that &quot;There are about 1500 priests here, who study the Little Vehicle according to the Sammatiya school. In his writings, Xuanzang mentioned a pillar constructed by Ashoka near a stupa that marked the location where the Buddha set the wheel of the law in motion.

===8th century – 12th century===
During the Pala (8th–11th centuries) period, the rulers built new &quot;mahaviharas&quot; such as Odantapuri, Somapura, Jagaddala, and Vikramashila and patronised existing ones such as Nalanda and Sarnath. During this time, Buddhist pilgrims and monks from all over Asia travelled to Sarnath to meditate and study. The Palas were the last major Buddhist dynasty to rule in the Indian subcontinent. They were replaced by the Gahadavala dynasty, whose capital was located at Varanasi.

Although the Gahadavala kings were Hindu, they were tolerant of Buddhism. Inscriptions unearthed at Sarnath in the early 20th century indicate that some of the monasteries there enjoyed royal patronage from the Gahadavala rulers. For example, in a mid-12th-century inscription attributed to Queen Kumaradevi (consort of King Govindachandra) and member of the Pithipati dynasty of Bodh Gaya. She takes credit for the construction or restoration of a living quarters for monks. 

It is widely asserted that the structure referred to in the Kumaradevi inscription is the Dharma Chakra Jina Vihar, but the evidence for this is inconclusive. Whatever the case, it is likely to be among the last structures to be built at Sarnath prior to its destruction in 1194. The inscription, excavated at Sarnath in March 1908, is currently maintained at the Sarnath Archeological Museum.

===Late 12th century: the destruction of Sarnath===
Along with Sarnath, the most important Buddhist &quot;mahaviharas&quot; in India were Vikramashila, Odantapuri, and Nalanda, all located in present-day Bihar. All four of these centres of learning continued to thrive throughout the 12th century, probably because of the protection, support and tolerance demonstrated by the Pala and Gahadavala rulers. For example, the mentions that King Govindachandra had protected Varanasi from invasions by the Ghaznavids which the inscription refers to as Turushkas in the early to mid-12th century. Apart from North India, Buddhism had been declining throughout the Indian subcontinent and had virtually disappeared by the 11th century.

Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent in the late 12th century brought massive plunder and destruction to northern India. Most notable among these were the Indian campaigns of Muhammad of Ghor, the Ghurid dynasty ruler from Ghazni, which is in present-day Afghanistan. Qutb ud-Din Aibak — the commander of Muhammad of Ghor&#x27;s army — led his men from Ghazni to Varanasi and Sarnath in 1194 CE. Jayachandra (c. 1170–1194 CE) was the reigning Gahadavala dynasty king at that time and was killed during the Battle of Chandawar. Virtually everything of value in Varanasi and Sarnath was destroyed or plundered. 

Qutbuddin Aibek reportedly carted away some 1400 camel loads of treasure. According to the 13th-century Persian historian Hasan Nizami, &quot;nearly 1000 temples were destroyed and mosques were raised on their foundations, the Rais and chiefs of Hind came forward to proffer their allegiance [to the Ghurids]&quot;.

While Qutbuddin Aibek destroyed Sarnath, it was the troops of Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji—another of Muhammad of Ghor&#x27;s slave generals—that continued to destroy sites sacred to Buddhists. They destroyed Vikramashila in 1193, Odantapuri in 1197, and Nalanda in 1200. The Buddhists who survived this genocide in northern India fled to Nepal, Sikkim, Tibet, or South India. By the end of the 12th century, Buddhist monastic centers and their vast libraries had nearly disappeared from the Indian subcontinent.

===18th century: rediscovery and looting===
Very few Buddhists remained in India after their persecution and expulsion at the end of the 12th century by the Ghurids. Buddhists from Tibet, Burma, and Southeast Asia continued to make pilgrimages to South Asia from the 13th to the 17th centuries, but their most common destination was Bodh Gaya and not Sarnath. Sarnath continued to be a place of pilgrimage for Jains, however. A 17th-century Jain manuscript written in 1612 CE (the &quot;Tirthakalpa&quot;, by Jinaprabha Suri) describes a Jain temple in Varanasi as being located close to &quot;a famous Bodisattva sanctuary&quot; at a place called &quot;dharmeksā&quot;. This Sanskrit word translates to &quot;pondering of the law&quot;, and clearly refers to the Dhamek Stupa.

India experienced an increase in visitation by European people in the late 18th century. In 1778, William Hodges became possibly the first British landscape painter to visit India. While there, he made careful observations of the art and architecture he encountered. He published an illustrated book about his travels in India in 1794. In his book, he described mosques and other Islamic architecture, Hindu temples, and Greek-inspired columns. Hodges also briefly described the Dhamek Stupa, although he mistook it to be a ruined Hindu temple.

In what is the first incontrovertible modern reference to the ruins at Sarnath, Jonathan Duncan (a charter member of the Asiatic Society and later Governor of Bombay) described the discovery of a green marble reliquary encased in a sandstone box in the relic chamber of a brick stupa at that location. The reliquary was discovered in January 1794, during the dismantling of a stupa (referred to by Alexander Cunningham as stupa &quot;K&quot; or the &quot;Jagat Singh stupa&quot;, later identified as the Dharmarajika Stupa) by employees of Zamindar Jagat Singh (the dewan of Maharaja Chait Singh, the Raja of Benares). Duncan published his observations in 1799. 

The reliquary contained a few bones and some pearls, which were subsequently thrown into the Ganges river. The reliquary itself has also disappeared, although the outer sandstone box was replaced in the relic chamber, where it was rediscovered by Cunningham in 1835. The bricks of the stupa were hauled off and used for the construction of the market in Jagatganj, Varanasi. Jagat Singh and his crew also removed a large part of the facing of the Dhamek Stupa, and removed several Buddha statues which he retained at his house in Jagatganj.

===19th century: more looting and early archeological excavations===
The next modern description of Sarnath was by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, who visited the site around 1813. He drew a crude map of the site—which he called Buddha Kashi—at that time. Colin Mackenzie was an officer in the British East India Company who later became the first Surveyor General of India. Visiting Sarnath in 1815, he was the first to describe a dedicated exploration of the ruins. Throughout the early 19th century, amateur archeologists explored and excavated at Sarnath, removing antiquities, and several artists drew sketches of the site (especially of the Dhamek Stupa).

In 1835–1836, a 21-year-old British Army engineer with the Bengal Engineer Group named Alexander Cunningham conducted the first systematic archaeological excavations at Sarnath. He had carefully studied the writings of Faxian and Xuanzang, two Chinese Buddhist monks who travelled extensively throughout northern India in the early 5th and early 7th centuries, respectively. Based on their writings and those of Duncan, he conducted some careful measurements and excavations at Sarnath in 1835–1836. During the course of these excavations, Cunningham discovered and removed many statues from monastery &quot;L&quot; and temple &quot;M&quot;, as well as the sandstone box reported by Duncan from the Dharmarajika Stupa. He presented these items to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and they are now located in the Indian Museum in Kolkata. By 1836, Cunningham had conclusively identified Sarnath as the location of the Buddha&#x27;s first sermon. In 1861, Cunningham became the founder and first Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India.

In 1851–1852, Markham Kittoe (1808–1853) conducted further excavations at Sarnath. Kittoe noted the presence of four stupas at Sarnath and excavated a structure he described as a hospital, which was located roughly midway between the Dhamek and Jagat Singh stupas. He also recovered a seated Buddha statue from Jagat Singh&#x27;s house and transcribed its inscription. In his writings, Kittoe speculated that Sarnath was destroyed as a result of a great fire.

Sometime in the mid-19th century, Sarnath was subjected to further depredations, as 48 statues and a tremendous amount of bricks and stones were removed from the historic site to be used in the construction of two bridges over the Varuna River. A final instance of despoilation occurred around 1898, when many bricks and stones were removed from Sarnath and used as ballast for a narrow-gauge railway that was under construction at that time.

===20th century: extensive excavations and restoration===

Friedrich Oertel conducted extensive excavations in 1904-1905. His team focused on the area near stupa &quot;J&quot; (the Dhamek Stupa), stupa &quot;K&quot; (&quot;Jagat Singh stupa&quot;, now known as the Dharmarajika Stupa), monastery &quot;L&quot;, temple &quot;M&quot;, hospital &quot;N&quot;, monastery &quot;O&quot;, and the Ashokan pillar. In March 1905, the team exhumed parts of the base and shaft of the pillar with its Schism Edict, lion capital, and remnants of the &quot;dharmachakra&quot; sculpture. Dating to c. 241-233 BCE, these are the oldest and most important relics discovered at Sarnath thus far. J. Ph. Vogel translated the inscription—which was written in the Brahmi of the Maurya period-and tentatively dated it to 249 BCE.

==Present day==

According to the &quot;Mahaparinibbana Sutta&quot; (&quot;Sutta&quot; 16 of the &quot;Digha Nikaya&quot;), the Buddha mentioned Sarnath as one of the four places of pilgrimage his devout followers should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence. During the British East India&#x27;s colonial rule, ancient sites such as Sarnath were subjected to extensive archaeological study. Certain levels of restoration occurred decades later.

Consequently, Sarnath has regained its former status as a place of pilgrimage, both for Buddhists and Jains. In 1998, Sarnath was nominated for inclusion on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) list of World Heritage Sites of outstanding universal value to cultural heritage. The nomination comprises two groups of monuments: group &quot;A&quot; is represented by the Chaukhandi Stupa, while all other monuments (e.g., temples, stupas, monasteries, and the pillar of Ashoka) are included as part of group &quot;B&quot;. 

The sites of the greatest importance to Buddhist pilgrims include:
* The Dhamek Stupa is considered to mark the location of the Buddha&#x27;s first teaching. Scholars believe that the name of the stupa might be a combination of the words &#x27;Dharma Chakra&#x27;, which means &quot;Turning the Wheel of Dharma&quot;. A reliquary stupa was built on the site after the Buddha&#x27;s passing, and then likely modified by Ashoka who in 249 BCE was recorded as changing the stupa while he was gathering and redistributing the Buddha&#x27;s relics. Its inner chambers had held reliquaries. It is an impressive structure, high and in diameter.
* The Dharmarajika Stupa is one of the few pre-Ashokan stupas remaining at Sarnath, although only the foundations remain. It has been the subject of extensive depredations and archaeological excavations, from the late 18th through the early 20th century.
* The Ashokan pillar erected here was broken during the invasions of the 12th century but many of the pieces remain at the original location. The pillar was originally surmounted by the Lion Capital of Ashoka, which in turn served as the base of a large 32-spoke sandstone wheel of dharma. The lion capital and the wheel of dharma, presently on display at the Sarnath Archeological Museum, now symbolize the modern state of India. Both of these appear on the emblem of the Supreme Court of India, and the wheel of dharma is incorporated in the flag of India.
* The ruins of the ancient Mulagandha Kuty Vihara mark the place where the Buddha spent his first rainy season. This was the main temple later marked by the presence of the Ashokan pillar at the front. The 5th-century CE sandstone sculpture of &quot;Buddha Preaching his First Sermon&quot; was found in the vicinity. The contemporary Mulagandha Kuty Vihara, dating from the 1930s, currently holds the bone relics of the Buddha.
* The Dharma Chakra Jina Vihar, a massive monastery and living quarters for monks believed to have been constructed or restored in the mid-12th century at the behest of Kumaradevi, a wife of Govindachandra (c. 1114–1155 CE).
* The Chaukhandi Stupa, located outside of Deer Park, commemorates the place where the Buddha reunited his first five disciples Kaundinya, Assaji, Bhaddiya, Vappa, and Mahanama. It is capped with an octagonal brick tower that was erected as a memorial to Emperor Humayun by his son Akbar in 1588 CE.
* The Sarnath Archeological Museum houses the famous Lion Capital of Ashoka, which survived a 45-foot drop to the ground from the top of the Ashokan pillar, and became the State Emblem of India and national symbol on the flag of India. The museum also houses the original 5th-century CE sandstone sculpture of &quot;Buddha Preaching his First Sermon&quot;, as well as the Kumaradevi inscription.

==Modern places of worship==
In addition to the archaeological ruins, there are a number of other pilgrimage sites and places of worship in Sarnath. Among these are included:
* The modern Mulagandha Kuty Vihara is a temple constructed by the Maha Bodhi Society; it was opened to the public in 1931. Wealthy Hawaiian philanthropist and benefactor Mary Robinson Foster provided much of the financial support for this project, while Anagarika Dharmapala supervised its construction. Dharmapala was a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk who was instrumental in the revival of Buddhism in India after it had been virtually extinct in that country for seven centuries. The temple contains a gilded replica of a 5th-century CE sculpture of &quot;Buddha Preaching his First Sermon&quot;. Its interior walls are extensively decorated with frescoes by Japanese artist Kosetsu Nosu (1885-1973), depicting important events in the life of the Buddha.
* Anagarika Dharmapala Museum &amp; offices of the Maha Bodhi Society, located on Dharmapala Road, just south of the modern Mulagandha Kuty Vihara
* A standing Buddha statue, in height, inspired by the Buddhas of Bamiyan, is located on the grounds of the Thai temple and monastery at Sarnath. Construction began in 1997, and the statue was finally unveiled in 2011.
* A number of countries and regions in which Buddhism is a major religion (such as Cambodia, China, Japan, Korea, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tibet, and Vietnam) have established temples and monasteries in Sarnath in the style that is typical for their respective cultures, so visitors can gain insight into Buddhism from the perspectives of many different cultures.

==As a Jain pilgrimage site==

Singhpur (Simhapuri), a village approximately northwest of Sarnath, is believed to be the birthplace of Shreyansanatha, the 11th &quot;tirthankara&quot; of Jainism. It is also the place where four of the five auspicious life events of Shreyansanatha took place. According to Jain cosmology, the fifth auspicious life event is the attainment of &quot;moksha&quot;. Shreyansanatha was among the twenty Jain &quot;tirthankaras&quot; who attained &quot;moksha&quot; in Sametshikhar.

Sarnath has been an important pilgrimage site for Jains for centuries. A 17th-century Jain manuscript describes a Jain temple in Varanasi as being located close to &quot;a famous Bodisattva sanctuary&quot; at a place called &quot;dharmeksā&quot;. This Sanskrit word translates to &quot;pondering of the law&quot;, and clearly refers to the Dhamek Stupa. The current edifice—Sarnath Jain Tirth (also known as the Shri Digamber Jain Temple or Shreyanshnath Jain Temple)—was constructed in 1824. Located only about to the southwest of the Dhamek Stupa, this temple is dedicated to Shreyansanatha. The main deity of this temple is a blue-coloured statue of Shreyansanatha, in height, in the lotus position.

==Other tourist attractions==
Tourist attractions unrelated to Buddhism and spirituality in Sarnath include the Sarnath Deer Park and Fish Canal, and the Sarnath Turtle Breeding and Rehabilitation Centre.

==In English literature==
In her 1832 poetical illustration , to a picture by Samuel Prout, Letitia Elizabeth Landon compared the four major religions of the world and mentioned the persecution and subsequent expulsion of the Buddhists from India.

Sarnath is one of the locations of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1901 novel &quot;Kim&quot;. Teshoo Lama stays at the &quot;Temple of the Tirthankhers&quot; in Sarnath when not on his pilgrimages.

&quot;The Nameless City&quot; is a fictional short story published in 1921 by H. P. Lovecraft. When the narrator of this story sees the ruins of the Nameless City, he &quot;thought of Sarnath the Doomed, that stood in the land of Mnar when mankind was young, and of Ib, that was carven of grey stone before mankind existed.&quot; Lovecraft had previously described the fictional city of Sarnath in his 1920 story &quot;The Doom That Came to Sarnath&quot;.

<text>Tim O&#x27;Brien (born October 1, 1946) is an American novelist who served as a soldier in the Vietnam War. Much of his writing is about wartime Vietnam, and his work later in life often explores the postwar lives of its veterans.

O&#x27;Brien is perhaps best known for his book &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; (1990), a collection of linked semi-autobiographical stories inspired by his wartime experiences. In 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a classic of contemporary war fiction.&quot; O&#x27;Brien wrote the war novel, &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot; (1978), which was awarded the National Book Award.

O&#x27;Brien taught creative writing, holding the endowed chair at the MFA program of Texas State University–San Marcos every other academic year from 2003 to 2012.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tim O&#x27;Brien was born in Austin, Minnesota on October
1, 1946, the son of William Timothy O&#x27;Brien and Ava Eleanor Schultz O&#x27;Brien. When he was ten, his family – including a younger brother and sister – moved to Worthington, Minnesota. Worthington had a large influence on O’Brien&#x27;s imagination and his early development as an author. The town is on Lake Okabena in the southwestern part of the state and serves as the setting for some of his stories, especially those in &quot;The Things They Carried&quot;.

===Military service===
O&#x27;Brien earned his BA in 1968 in political science from Macalester College, where he was student body president. That same year he was drafted into the United States Army and was sent to Vietnam, where he served from 1969 to 1970 in 3rd Platoon, Company A, 5th Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment, part of the 23rd Infantry Division (the Americal Division) that contained the unit that perpetrated the My Lai Massacre the year before his arrival. O&#x27;Brien has said that when his unit got to the area around My Lai (referred to as &quot;Pinkville&quot; by the U.S. forces), &quot;we all wondered why the place was so hostile. We did not know there had been a massacre there a year earlier. The news about that only came out later, while we were there, and then we knew.&quot;

===First book published===
Upon completing his tour of duty, O&#x27;Brien went to graduate school at Harvard University. Afterward he received an internship at the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. In 1973 he published his first book, a memoir, &quot;If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home&quot;, about his war experiences. In this memoir, O&#x27;Brien writes: &quot;Can the foot soldier teach anything important about war, merely for having been there? I think not. He can tell war stories.&quot;

===Personal life===
 O&#x27;Brien lived in central Texas, raising a family and teaching full-time every other year at Texas State University–San Marcos. His two sons were born when he was 56 and 58 respectively. In alternate years, he teaches several workshops to MFA students in the creative writing program.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

==Writing style==

In the story &quot;Good Form,&quot; from his collection of semi-autobigraphical stories, &quot;The Things They Carried&quot;, O&#x27;Brien discusses the distinction between &quot;story-truth&quot; (the truth of fiction) and &quot;happening-truth&quot; (the truth of fact or occurrence), writing that &quot;story-truth is sometimes truer than happening-truth.&quot; O’Brien suggests that story truth is emotional truth. In turn, the emotions created by a fictional story are sometimes truer than what results from only reading the facts.

This demonstrates one aspect of O’Brien&#x27;s writing style: a blurring of the usual distinction we make between fiction and reality, in that the author uses details from his own life, but frames them in a self-conscious or metafictional narrative voice.

By the same token, certain sets of stories in &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; seem to contradict each other, and certain stories are designed to &quot;undo&quot; the suspension of disbelief created in previous stories. For example, &quot;Speaking of Courage&quot; is followed by &quot;Notes&quot;, which explains in what ways &quot;Speaking of Courage&quot; is fictional. This is another example of how O’Brien blurs the traditional distinctions we make between fact and fiction.

==Personal views on the Vietnam War==
While O&#x27;Brien does not consider himself a spokesman for the Vietnam War, he has occasionally commented on it. Speaking years later about his upbringing and the war, O&#x27;Brien described his hometown as &quot;a town that congratulates itself, day after day, on its own ignorance of the world: a town that got us into Vietnam. Uh, the people in that town sent me to that war, you know, couldn&#x27;t spell the word &#x27;Hanoi&#x27; if you spotted them three vowels.&quot;

Contrasting the continuing American search for U.S. MIA/POWs in Vietnam with the reality of the high number of Vietnamese war dead, he describes the American perspective as 
A perverse and outrageous double standard. What if things were reversed? What if the Vietnamese were to ask us, or to require us, to locate and identify each of their own MIAs? Numbers alone make it impossible: 100,000 is a conservative estimate. Maybe double that. Maybe triple. From my own sliver of experience—one year at war, one set of eyes—I can testify to the lasting anonymity of a great many Vietnamese dead.

O&#x27;Brien was interviewed for &quot;&quot; as well as Ken Burns&#x27;s 2017 documentary series &quot;The Vietnam War.&quot;

<doc id="226045" wikidata="Q176767" url="?curid=226045" title="Bodh Gaya">
<text>Bodh Gayā is a religious site and place of pilgrimage associated with the Mahabodhi Temple complex, situated in the Gaya district in the Indian state of Bihar. It is famous for being the place where Gautama Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment (Pali: ) under what became known as the Bodhi Tree. Since antiquity, Bodh Gayā has remained the object of pilgrimage and veneration, for both Hindus and Buddhists. In particular, archaeological finds, including sculptures, show that the site was in use by Buddhists since the Mauryan period. 

For Buddhists, Bodh Gayā is the most important of the four main pilgrimage sites related to the life of Gautama Buddha, the other three being Kushinagar, Lumbini, and Sarnath. In 2002, Mahabodhi Temple, located in Bodh Gayā, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==

Bodh Gayā is considered the holiest site in Buddhism. Known as Uruvela in the Buddha&#x27;s time, it is by the bank of the Lilajan River. The first temple at the site was built by Maurya Emperor Ashoka.

Traditionally, it is believed that the Buddha was born in 563 BCE on the next Baisakhi purnima (second full moon in calendar years that do not themselves start during full moon) in Lumbini, Nepal. As Siddhartha, he renounced his family at the age of 29 in 534 BCE, and travelled and meditated in search of truth. After practicing self-mortification for six years at Urubela (Buddhagaya) in Gaya, he gave up that practice because it did not give him liberation. Then he discovered the Noble Eightfold Path of his own and practiced it, finally reaching enlightenment: complete freedom from lust (raga), hatred (dvesha), and delusion (moha).
At this point, the Buddha was abandoned by the five men who had been his companions in his earlier austerities, as all they saw was an ordinary man; mocking his well-nourished appearance, they said, &quot;Here comes the mendicant Gautama, who has turned away from asceticism. He is certainly not worth our respect.&quot; When they reminded him of his former vows, the Buddha replied, &quot;Austerities only confuse the mind. In the exhaustion and mental stupor to which they lead, one can no longer understand the ordinary things of life, still less the truth that lies beyond the senses. I have given up extremes of either luxury or asceticism. I have discovered the Middle Way.&quot; This is explained as the path that is neither easy (his former life as a rich prince) nor hard (living in austere conditions, practicing self-denial). Hearing this, the five ascetics became the Buddha&#x27;s first disciples in Deer Park, Sarnath, northeast of Varanasi.

Gautama&#x27;s disciples began to visit the place during the full moon in the month of Vaisakh (April–May), as per the Hindu calendar. Over time, the place became known as Bodh Gayā, the day of enlightenment as Buddha Purnima, and the tree as the Bodhi Tree.

Bodh Gayā&#x27;s history is documented by many inscriptions and pilgrimage accounts. Foremost among these are the accounts of the Chinese pilgrims Faxian in the 5th century and Xuanzang in the 7th century. The area was at the heart of a Buddhist civilization for centuries, until it was conquered by Turkic armies in the 13th century.

The placename Bodh Gayā came into use in the 18th century CE. Historically, it was known as Uruvela, Sambodhi (, Saṃ + bodhi, meaning &#x27;Complete Enlightenment&#x27; in Ashoka&#x27;s Major Rock Edict No.8), Vajrasana (the &#x27;Diamond Throne&#x27; of the Buddha), or Mahabodhi (&#x27;Great Enlightenment&#x27;). Bodh Gayā&#x27;s main monastery used to be called the Bodhimanda-vihāra (Pali); it is now known as the Mahabodhi Temple.

From the 11th to 13th centuries, Bodh Gayā was under the control of local chieftains known as the Pithipatis of Bodh Gaya, who were responsible for managing the region. One of their rulers, Acarya Buddhasena, has been recorded as making a grant to Sri Lankan monks near the Mahabodhi temple. During the 12th century, Muslim Turk armies led by Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s Qutb al-Din Aibak and Bakhtiyar Khilji invaded and destroyed Bodh Gayā and nearby regions.

==Mahabodhi Temple==
The complex, about from Patna, at , contains the Mahabodhi Temple with the Vajrasana or &quot;diamond throne&quot; and the Bodhi tree. This tree was originally a sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka, itself grown from a what is claimed to be a sapling of the original Bodhi tree.

In approximately 250 BCE, about 200 years after the Buddha attained Enlightenment, Emperor Asoka visited Bodh Gayā to establish a monastery and shrine there.

Representations of this early temple are found at Sanchi, on the toraṇas of Stūpa I, dating from around 25 BCE, and on a relief carving from the stupa railing at Bhārhut, from the early Shunga period ().

==Other Buddhist temples==
Kittisirimegha of Sri Lanka, a contemporary of Samudragupta, erected with his permission a Sanghārāma near the Mahabodhi Temple, chiefly for the use of the Singhalese monks who went to worship the Bodhi tree. The circumstances in connection with the Sanghārāma are given by Xuanzang, who describes it as he saw it. It was probably here that Buddhaghosa met the Elder Revata, who persuaded him to come to Ceylon.

Several Buddhist temples and monasteries have been built by the people of Tibet, Mongolia, Nepal, Japan, Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sikkim, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Bhutan, and China in a wide area around the Mahabodhi Temple. These buildings reflect their respective countries&#x27; architectural and decorative styles. The statue of the Buddha in the Chinese temple is 200 years old, and was brought from China. Japan&#x27;s Nippon temple is shaped like a pagoda. The Myanmar (Burmese) temple is also pagoda-shaped and is reminiscent of Bagan. The Thai temple has a sloping, curved roof covered with golden tiles and contains a massive bronze statue of the Buddha. Next to the Thai temple is a statue of the Buddha within a garden that has existed for over 100 years.

===Sujata Stupa===
Across the Phalgu river is the Sujata Stupa, in the village of Bakraur. The stupa was dedicated to the milkmaid Sujata, who is said to have fed the Buddha milk and rice as he was sitting under a Banyan tree, ending his seven years of fasting and asceticism and allowing him to attain illumination through the Middle Way. The stupa was built in the 2nd century BCE, as confirmed by finds of black polished wares and punch-marked coins in the attending monastery.

===Sujata Temple===
The Sujata Temple, in Sujata Village in Bakrour, is a significant historical and religious site associated with the life of Siddhartha Gautama, who later became the Buddha. This temple commemorates the pivotal moment when Sujata, a village woman, offered Siddhartha a bowl of rice milk, providing him with nourishment after years of severe asceticism. This is said to have given Siddhartha the strength to pursue the Middle Path, ultimately leading to his enlightenment. The temple stands near the banks of the Niranjana River, symbolizing the site where this transformative event took place. The architecturally modest Sujata Temple attracts pilgrims and tourists. The surrounding village and the serene landscape add to the temple&#x27;s spiritual ambiance, making it a place of contemplation and homage.

==The Great Buddha Statue==
An statue of the Buddha, known as The Great Buddha Statue, is in Bodh Gayā. It was unveiled and consecrated on 18 November 1989. The consecration ceremony was attended by the 14th Dalai Lama, who blessed the statue, the first great Buddha ever built in the history of India. Under the slogan &quot;Spread Buddha&#x27;s rays to the Whole World&quot;, Daijokyo spent seven years constructing the statue, mobilizing 120,000 masons.

==Mahabodhi Temple bombings==

On 7 July 2013, at around 5:15a.m., there was a low-intensity bomb blast in the Mahabodhi Temple complex. This was followed by a series of nine low-intensity blasts that injured two monks, one Tibetan and one Burmese. These blasts were carried out by the Islamist terrorist organization Indian Mujahideen. Police defused two other bombs, one under the Buddha statue and one near Karmapa Temple.

On 1 June 2018, a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court of Patna sentenced five suspects in the case to life imprisonment.

==Demographics==
At the 2001 census, Bodh Gaya had a population of 30,883. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Bodh Gaya has an average literacy rate of 51%, lower than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy of 63% and female literacy of 38%. 8% of the population is under 6 years of age.

==Transportation==

* Buses have been introduced by the BSTDC between Patna and Bodh Gaya via Rajgir.
*A special caravan service called Wonder on Wheel, between Patna and Bodh Gaya, has been introduced by the Bihar Tourism Department.
*Gaya Airport is from Bodh Gaya and about from Gaya Junction railway station.
*Bodhgaya has restricted the use of auto rickshaws, cars, and buses to make the site more peaceful. A permit is required to use cars or buses, and the only taxi available is an electric rickshaw that is mostly noiseless.

==Sister cities==
Bodh Gaya has one official sister city:
* Nara Prefecture, Japan

<doc id="226047" wikidata="Q2739432" url="?curid=226047" title="Road pricing">
<text>Road pricing are direct charges levied for the use of roads, including road tolls, distance or time-based fees, congestion charges and charges designed to discourage the use of certain classes of vehicle, fuel sources or more polluting vehicles. These charges may be used primarily for revenue generation, usually for road infrastructure financing, or as a transportation demand management tool to reduce peak hour private vehicle travel and the associated traffic congestion or other social and environmental negative externalities associated with road travel such as air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, visual intrusion, noise pollution and road traffic collisions.

In most countries toll roads, toll bridges and toll tunnels are often used primarily for revenue generation to repay long-term debt issued to finance the toll facility, or to finance capacity expansion, operations, and maintenance of the facility itself, or simply as general tax funds. Road congestion pricing for entering an urban area, or pollution charges levied on vehicles with higher tailpipe emissions are typical schemes implemented to price externalities. The application of congestion charges is currently limited to a small number of cities and urban roads, and the notable schemes include the Electronic Road Pricing in Singapore, the London congestion charge, the Stockholm congestion tax, the Milan Area C, and high-occupancy toll lanes in the United States. Examples of pollution pricing schemes include the London low emission zone and the discontinued Ecopass in Milan. In some European countries there is a period-based charge for the use of motorways and expressways, based on a vignette or sticker attached to a vehicle, and in a few countries vignettes are required for the use of any road. Mileage-based usage fees (MBUF) or distance-based charging has been implemented for heavy vehicles based on truck weight and distance traveled in New Zealand (called RUC), Switzerland (LSVA), Germany (LKW-Maut), Austria (Go-Maut), Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and in four U.S. states: Oregon, New York, Kentucky, and New Mexico.

Many recent road pricing schemes have proved controversial, with a number of high-profile schemes in the US and the UK being cancelled, delayed, or scaled back in response to opposition and protest. The tendency seems to reverse, however, when the system is already in place, with the popularity of existing systems often increasing while merely discussed systems face an uphill battle in public opinion. A 2006 survey of the economic literature on the subject finds that most economists agree that some form of road pricing to reduce congestion is economically viable and overall beneficial, although there is disagreement on what form road pricing should take. Economists disagree over how to set tolls, how to cover common costs, and what to do with any &quot;excess&quot; revenues (i.e., Revenues that exceed direct costs of road construction and maintenance, but which may still not cover external costs fully), whether and how &quot;losers&quot; from tolling previously free roads should be compensated, and whether to privatize highways.

==Terminology==
Road pricing is a general term that may be used for any system where the driver pays directly for use of a particular roadway or road network in a particular city, region, or nation. Road pricing also includes congestion charging, which are charges levied on qualifying road users to reduce peak demand, and thereby reduce traffic congestion and also to place a charge on road users for other negative externalities, including traffic accidents, noise, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.

==History==
The first published reference to &#x27;road pricing&#x27; was possibly in 1949 when the RAND Corporation proposed &quot;use of direct road pricing to make freight journeys more expensive on congested routes or to influence the time of day at which freight traffic operates&quot;. Nobel-laureate William Vickrey then built on the ideas of the economist Arthur Pigou, outlining a theoretical case for road pricing in a major work on the subject of 1955 proposing in 1959 that drivers should be charged by electronic means for use of busy urban roads. Arthur Pigou had previously developed the concept of economic externalities in a publication of 1920 in which he proposed that what is now referred to as a Pigouvian tax equal to the negative externality should be used to bring the outcome within a market economy back to economic efficiency.

In 1963 Vickery published a paper &#x27;Pricing in urban and suburban transport&#x27; in the American Economic Review and Gabriel Joseph Roth, John Michael Thomson of the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Cambridge published a short paper titled &quot;Road pricing, a cure for congestion?&quot; The Smeed Report, &#x27;Road Pricing: The Economic and Technical Possibilities&#x27;, which had been commissioned in 1962 by the United Kingdom Ministry of Transport, was published in 1964. Road pricing was then developed by Maurice Allais and Gabriel Roth in a paper titled &quot;The Economics of Road User Charges&quot; published by the World Bank in 1968.

The first successful implementation of a congestion charge was with the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme in 1976. The Electronic Road Pricing (Hong Kong) scheme operated as a trial between 1983 and 1985 but was not continued permanently due to public opposition. A number of road tolling schemes were then introduced in Norway between 1986 and 1991 in Bergen, Oslo, and the Trondheim Toll Scheme. It was noticed that the Oslo scheme had the unintended effect of reducing traffic by around 5%. The Singapore scheme was expanded in 1995 and converted to use a new electronic tolling system in 1998 and renamed Electronic Road Pricing. The first use of a road toll for access by low-occupancy vehicles to high-occupancy vehicle lane was introduced in the U.S. on California State Route 91 in 1995. Since 2000, other schemes have been introduced, although the New York congestion pricing proposal and a number of UK proposals were not progressed due to public opposition. In France road pricing came about as an unintended consequence of the way highways are built and financed as most are built by for-profit companies which earn back their expense through tolls. Some other European countries also have similar schemes either on parts of their highway network or only on particularly expensive roads such as tunnels, bridges, or mountain range crossings.

==Impact==
A study of congestion pricing in Stockholm between 2006 and 2010 found that in the absence of congestion pricing Stockholm&#x27;s &quot;air would have been five to ten percent more polluted between 2006 and 2010, and young children would have suffered 45 percent more asthma attacks&quot;.

A 2013 study found that after congestion pricing was implemented in Seattle, drivers reported greater satisfaction with the routes covered by congestion pricing and reported lower stress.

A 2016 study found that more people used public transportation due to the implementation of congestion pricing in Singapore. A 2016 study found that real estate prices dropped by 19% within the cordoned-off areas of Singapore where congestion pricing was in place relative to the areas outside of the area.

Research from 2019 provides a set of tools to enable analysis and measurement of the impacts of toll pricing, toll payment, toll collection technology, and other aspects of toll implementation and rate changes on low-income and minority populations.

==Example schemes==

===Asia-Pacific===

====Australia====
In January 2009, variable tolls were implemented at Sydney Harbour Bridge, two weeks after upgrading to 100% free-flow electronic toll collection. The highest fees are charged during the morning and afternoon peak periods; a toll 25% lower applies for the shoulder periods; and a toll lower than the previously existing is charged at nights, weekends, and public holidays. This is Australia&#x27;s first road congestion pricing scheme, and has had only a very minor effect on traffic levels, reducing them by 0.19%

====China====
Main roadways and highways in Shanghai are tolled, and an assessment was completed to evaluate the implementation of congestion pricing for vehicles entering the central business district. The city also restrains car use, ownership and there are restrictions on getting a driver&#x27;s license; since 1998, the number of new car registrations is limited to 50,000 vehicles a year, and car registrations are sold by public auction, with prices reaching up to US$5,000 in 2006. Parking is also limited.

Congestion based pricing for Beijing was recommended by the World Bank in 2010 and local officials announced plans to introduce a scheme in September 2011 although no details about the cost or the charge zone have been provided. The city is dealt with traffic congestion and air pollution through a driving restriction scheme implemented since the 2008 Summer Olympics. , another 11 Chinese cities have similar restriction schemes in place.

In early 2010 the city Guangzhou, Guangdong province, opened a public discussion on whether to introduce congestion charges. An online survey conducted by two local news outlets found that 84.4% of respondents opposed the charges. The city of Nanjing is also considering the implementation of congestion pricing.

In December 2015, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport announced plans to introduce congestion charges in 2016. According to the city&#x27;s motor vehicle emission control plan 2013–2017, the congestion charge will be a real-time variable pricing scheme based on actual traffic flows and emissions data, and allow the fee to be charged for different vehicles and vary by time of the day and for different districts. The Dongcheng and Xicheng are among the districts that are most likely to first implement congestion charges. Vehicle emissions account for 31% of the city&#x27;s smog sources, according to Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau. The local government has implemented already several policies to address air quality, and congestion, such as a driving restriction scheme based upon the last digits on their license plates. Also a vehicle quota system was introduced in 2011, awarding new car licenses through a lottery, with a ceiling of 6 million units set by the city authority for 2017. In May 2016, the Beijing city legislature announced it will consider starting levying traffic congestion charges by 2020 as part of a package of measures to reform the vehicle quota system. , the city&#x27;s environmental and transport departments are working together on a congestion pricing proposal.

====Hong Kong====

Hong Kong&#x27;s Electronic Road Pricing system operated between 1983 and 1985 with positive results. Public opposition stalled its permanent implementation. Proposals were however raised again in 2012.

====Singapore====
The world&#x27;s first congestion pricing scheme was introduced in Singapore&#x27;s core central business district in 1975 as the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme. It was extended in 1995 and converted to 100% free-flowing Electronic Road Pricing in September 1998. Variable pricing based on congestion levels was introduced in 2007. It is one of a number of elements in their Transportation Demand Management, which also includes high annual road tax, custom duties and vehicle registration fees for new vehicles, a quota system for new vehicles and heavy investment in public transportation. Singapore has one of the highest per capita incomes in Asia, but fewer than 30% of Singaporean households own cars.

===Europe===
==== Austria ====
A distance-based charging scheme called Go-Maut was implemented in Austria for all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes on motorways in 2004. In addition, all vehicles under 3.5 tonnes are required to buy a sticker or vignette to access the Austrian motorway network, which is owned and operated by a state-owned company called ASFINAG. The vignette enables the vehicle to use almost the entire motorway network in Austria for a specific period of time, with the lower charge set at for 10 days. However, there is an additional toll charge for selected routes, such as long tunnels and expensive routes through the Alps.

==== Belarus ====

See Toll roads in Belarus.

====Finland====
The only Finnish town to suffer serious road congestion is Helsinki, built on a narrow peninsula. In the 1980s and 1990s, the City Administration was already proposing tolls on vehicles entering the centre but the Chamber of Commerce successfully resisted these. Road pricing was taken up in the central government programme in 2011 when the coalition members committed themselves to examine &quot;the introduction of GPS-based road user charges&quot;. Transport minister Merja Kyllönen set up a working group to study &quot;road user charging systems&quot; in October 2012. The Ministry was committed to the architecture of the European Electronic Toll Service.

In March 2013, an independent Finnish policy institute recommended a market-based road pricing architecture for Europe. The roads needed for a journey could be pre-booked, the price of &quot;slots&quot; rising as the roads to be used approached capacity. The price would become payable at the scheduled time of departure unless the slot holder resold the slot before then. Casual motorists without bookings would be charged the current price. The paper proposed that Finland, having no serious road congestion to address, could serve as a testbed for road charging mechanisms.

The Transport Ministry&#x27;s working group reported in December 2013 that a tax proportional to road use would implement transport and environment policies better than current fixed taxes on motoring, although collection costs would be many times higher. The focus of transport policy should be on solving capacity problems by managing demand rather than by building new infrastructure. However, it argued that buses and lorries should be exempted from road use charges on the grounds that the rise in costs could not be offset by cutting other heavy vehicle road taxes, which were already close to the minimum set in the EU&#x27;s vignette directive. For private cars, the report looked at the implications of fixed and regional kilometre charges but did not consider market or other methods for responding to varying local congestion. Before the adoption of any system, it proposed broad trials to establish the technical viability of taxing road use, its enforceability, and the protection of privacy.

====Germany====

The LKW-MAUT distance-based charging scheme large goods vehicles in Germany began operation on 1 January 2005 after a two-year delay with prices varying depending on emission levels and the number of axles. The scheme, which combining satellite technology with other technologies and is operated by Toll Collect, suffered delays before implementation.

====Ireland====
Toll roads are common in Ireland for motorways and bridges/tunnels, with 11 toll roads in existence as of 2019.

In the 18th and 19th Centuries Turnpike trusts managed the roadways. However, with the onset of railways, the use of roads become far less popular, and tolling was abolished.

The first modern road charging scheme was introduced in 1984 on the East Link, a bascule lift bridge in Dublin&#x27;s docklands, constructed by National Toll Roads (NTR) under a public-private partnership concession. This was followed by the West-Link bridge in 1990, similarly a concession to NTR. However, despite the opening of a second bridge in 2003, capacity and toll management of the West-Link was woefully inadequate, resulting in massive congestion on the Dublin M50 ring road. In 2007, the government bought out NTR&#x27;s concession and introduced barrier-free tolling in order to end the jams.

In order to fund long-distance motorway construction in the mid-2000s, a new PPP model of DBOF (design, build, operate and finance PPP) concessions was adopted. International construction companies primarily backed these. The first such toll motorway was the M4/M6 operated by Spanish company Ferrovial, followed by routes such as the Eurolink M3 toll (a joint venture of Ferrovial and Irish company SIAC Construction), the M8 Fermoy bypass (owned by private equity and investment companies such as TIIC Group of Portugal, Aberdeen Standard Investments and 3I) and the M7/M9 Mid Link route owned by the Dutch company BAM and Spanish ACS Group). However, the onset of the Global Financial Crisis towards the end of the decade and the resulting Irish recession saw a large drop off in driving and use of tolls. No new toll routes have been proposed since the economic downturn. However, a model of PPP shadow-tolling has been adopted to build routes such as the M18.

====Italy====
Rome converted a residents&#x27; pass system for the core of the city to a road pricing system in 2001 and Genoa started a trial system in 2003.

The Milan &quot;Ecopass&quot; system began operation in early 2008 with the objective to reduce air pollution from vehicles. It was extended several times before being replaced by Area C, a conventional congestion pricing scheme covering the same geographic area in January 2012. Electric vehicles, public utilities&#x27; vehicles, police and emergency vehicles, buses, and taxis are exempted from the charge. Hybrid electric and bi-fuel natural gas vehicles (CNG and LPG) will be exempted until 1 January 2013.

The scheme was made permanent in March 2013. All net earnings from Area C are invested to promote sustainable mobility and policies to reduce air pollution, including the redevelopment, protection, and development of public transport, &quot;soft mobility&quot; (pedestrians, cycling, Zone 30), and systems to rationalize the distribution of goods.

====Malta====
The automated &#x27;Controlled Vehicular Access&#x27; (CVA) system was launched in Malta&#x27;s capital city of Valletta on 1 May 2007. The number of vehicles entering the city reduced from 10,000 to 7,900; there has also been a 60% drop in car stays by non-residents of more than eight hours with a marked increase of 34% in non-residential cars visiting the city for an hour or less.
====Norway====

Norway implemented electronic urban tolling on the main road corridors into Bergen (1986), Oslo (1990), and then the Trondheim Toll Scheme the following year. The Bergen scheme operated as a cordon on all entry points to the central area of the city. The Oslo scheme was initially created as a conventional road toll for revenue generation reasons but had the unintended effect of reducing traffic by around 5%. Charges vary by time of the day. Parliament approved the legal basis for introducing congestion charging fee in 2001 In October 2011 the Norwegian government announced the introduction of rules allowing congestion charging in cities. The measure is intended to cut greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, and relieve traffic congestion. , Norwegian authorities have implemented urban charging schemes that operates both on the motorways and for access into downtown areas in five additional cities or municipalities: Haugesund, Kristiansand, Namsos, Stavanger, and Tønsberg.

====Sweden====
The Stockholm congestion tax covering Stockholm City Centre was trialed for seven-month trial during 2006 and has been operational on a permanent basis since 1 August 2007; all the entrances and exits of this area have unmanned control points operating with automatic number plate recognition and most vehicles pay a fixed fee during peak hours.
A similar congestion tax was introduced in Gothenburg in 2013, the Gothenburg congestion tax. In opposite to Stockholm, this tax covers also the usage of bypass roads past the city.
The congestion tax is called a tax, not a toll or fee, since a principle has been established that road tolls can only exist to pay for the construction of the specific tolled road, during a limited period. The congestion tax charges every road that crosses certain lines, regardless of its age. Three bridges in Sweden have road tolls (as of 2015).

====United Kingdom====
The Smeed Report recommended the implementation of congestion charging in 1964. Road pricing for London was considered by the Greater London Council in 1973 but was not progressed. The Durham City congestion charge was introduced in 2002 and the London congestion charge in 2003.

In June 2005, Transport Secretary Alistair Darling announced a proposal for a national scheme in which every vehicle would be fitted with a satellite receiver that would calculate charges, with prices (including fuel duty) ranging from 2p per mile on uncongested roads to £1.34 on the most congested roads at peak times. The scheme was dropped after an online petition against proposals gained over 1.8 million signatures. A number of local schemes were then proposed and rejected during 2007–2008, including the Manchester congestion charge. UK wide road pricing for large goods vehicles, which was first proposed in 2000 before being dropped and then revived in 2012.

===== London =====
The London congestion charge is a flat-fee daily charge to enter the Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ) in central London, introduced in 2003. This was supplemented in 2008 by a Low Emission Zone charge, and in 2017 by a toxicity charge (&#x27;T-Charge&#x27;), now an Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) charge. A Western Extension to the Congestion Charge Zone was added in 2007 and then removed in January 2011.

A plan to incorporate an emissions-based supplement into the Congestion Charge was cancelled following the 2008 Mayoral election. Instead, the London low emission zone was introduced in stages between 2008 and 2012 with an aim of reducing the pollution emissions of diesel-powered commercial vehicles in London.

Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013, the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013, substituting the Greener Vehicle Discount. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limited the free access to the congestion charge zone to electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The measure was designed to curb the growing number of diesel vehicles on London&#x27;s roads. The owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount were granted a three-year sunset period before they have to pay the full congestion charge. The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016.

A toxicity charge, known as T-Charge, was introduced on 23 October 2017. Older and more polluting cars and vans that did not meet Euro 4 standards had to pay an extra £10 charge on top of the congestion charge to drive in central London, within the CCZ. The charge typically applied to diesel and petrol vehicles registered before 2006, and the levy was expected to affect up to 10,000 vehicles.

The T-Charge was replaced on 8 April 2019 with an ULEZ charge. Motor vehicles that do not meet the emissions criteria are charged £12.50 for most vehicle types, or £100 for heavier vehicles, to enter central London for a day. London-licensed taxis are exempted from the ULEZ; temporary exemptions and discounts apply to residents until 24 October 2021, and to disabled drivers until 26 October 2025.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced the introduction of the T-Charge on 17 February 2017 after London achieved record air pollution levels in January 2017, and the city was put on very high pollution alert for the first time ever, as cold and stationary weather failed to clear toxic pollutants emitted mainly by diesel vehicles. The Mayor also announced plans to expand the ULEZ beyond Central London a year earlier than planned in 2019.

===Middle East===

====Dubai====
The Salik (road toll) system in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was introduced by the Roads and Transport Authority in 2007 and extended in 2008.

===North America===

====New York====

In March 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey implemented a discount during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying tolls for several tunnels and bridges connecting New York City and New Jersey using the electronic EZ Pass. Since March 2008, qualified low-emission automobiles could get a 50% discount during off-peak hours.

In April 2007 the New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a contentious congestion charge on cars using most streets in the central business district (southern half of Manhattan) as part of the broader PlaNYC 2030. The plan received broad support from a coalition of civic, business, environmental, labor, community, and public health organizations and the City Council voted for the measure but also received significant opposition. The New York Legislature declined to vote on it in April 2008 saying that &quot;... the opposition was so overwhelming... that he would not hold an open vote of the full Assembly&quot;.

Governor Andrew Cuomo reintroduced a congestion pricing proposal for New York City in 2017 in response to the New York City Subway&#x27;s state of emergency, a proposal that Mayor Bill de Blasio opposed. A commission to investigate the feasibility of congestion pricing, organized in late 2017, found that a congestion pricing scheme could benefit New York City. If approved, New York City&#x27;s congestion pricing zone will be the first in North America. Cuomo&#x27;s administration was set to review these proposals in January 2018, although the details of the congestion zones had not been revealed yet.

====San Francisco====
In 2006, San Francisco authorities began a feasibility study to evaluate congestion pricing in the city. The initial charging scenarios considered were presented in public meetings held in December 2008 and the final draft proposal were discussed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (SFBS) in December 2010, which recommended implementation of a six-month to one-year trial in 2015. Separately, in July 2010 congestion tolls were implemented at the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
====Other metropolitan areas====
In August 2007, the United States Department of Transportation selected five metropolitan areas to initiate congestion pricing demonstration projects under the Urban Partnerships Congestion Initiative, for US$1 billion of federal funding. The five projects under this initiative are: Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, State Route 520 serving downtown Seattle and communities to its east, Interstate 95 between Miami and Ft. Lauderdale, Interstate 35W serving downtown Minneapolis, and a variable rate parking meter system in Chicago, which replaced New York City after it left the program in 2008.

====High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes====

High-occupancy toll lanes are lanes where a variable fee based on demand is charged to non-exempt vehicles. Exempt vehicles include high-occupancy vehicles, transit vehicles, and often also low-emission vehicles. Users not wanting to pay the fee can use general-purpose lanes. HOT lanes were first implemented on California&#x27;s private toll 91 Express Lanes, in Orange County in 1995, followed in 1996 by Interstate 15 in San Diego.

===South America===

====Brazil====
In January 2012, the federal government of Brazil enacted the Urban Mobility Law that authorizes municipalities to implement congestion pricing to reduce traffic flows. The law also seeks to encourage the use of public transportation and reduce air pollution. According to the law, revenues from congestion charges should be destined exclusively to urban infrastructure for public transportation and non-motorized modes of locomotion (such as walking and cycling), and to finance public subsidies for transit fares. The law went into effect in April 2013.
;São Paulo city
In April 2012, one of the committees of the São Paulo city council approved a bill to introduce a R$4 (~ ) per day congestion charge within the same area as the existing road space rationing () by the last digit of the license plate, which has been in force since 1996. The bill still needs approval by two other committees before going for a final vote at the city council. Opinion surveys have shown that the initiative is highly unpopular. A survey by Veja magazine found that 80% of drivers are against congestion pricing, and another survey by &quot;Exame&quot; magazine found that only 1% of São Paulo&#x27;s residents support the initiative, while 30% find that extending the metro system is a better solution to reduce traffic congestion. São Paulo&#x27;s strategic urban development plan &quot;SP 2040&quot;, approved in November 2012, proposes the implementation of congestion pricing by 2025, when the density of metro and bus corridors is expected to reach 1.25 km/km2. The Plan also requires ample consultation and even a referendum before beginning implementation.

====Chile====
Congestion pricing has also been implemented in urban freeways. Between 2004 and 2005, Santiago de Chile implemented the first 100% non-stop urban toll for concessioned freeways passing through a downtown area, charging by the distance traveled. Congestion pricing is used since 2007 during rush hours in order to maintain reasonable speeds within the city&#x27;s core with the aim of keeping a minimum level of service for their customers.

<doc id="226050" wikidata="Q4513" url="?curid=226050" title="Mahabodhi Temple">
<text>The Mahabodhi Temple (literally: &quot;Great Awakening Temple&quot;) or the Mahābodhi Mahāvihāra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is an ancient, but restored Buddhist temple in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India, marking the location where the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment. Bodh Gaya is from Gaya and is about from Patna. The site contains a tree believed to be a descendant of the Bodhi Tree under which the Buddha gained enlightenment and has been a major pilgrimage destination of Buddhists for over two thousand years.

Some of the site&#x27;s elements date to the period of Ashoka (died ). What is now visible on the ground dates from the 6th century CE, or possibly earlier, as well as several major restorations since the 19th century. The structure, however, also potentially incorporates large parts of earlier work, possibly from the 2nd or 3rd-century CE. Archaeological finds from the site indicate that the place was a site of veneration for Buddhists since at least the Mauryan period. In particular, the Vajrasana, which is located within the temple itself has been dated to the third-century BCE.

Many of the oldest sculptural elements have been moved to the museum beside the temple, and some, such as the carved stone railing wall around the main structure, have been replaced by replicas. The main temple&#x27;s survival is especially impressive, as it was mostly made of brick covered with stucco, materials that are much less durable than stone. However, it is understood that very little of the original sculptural decoration has survived.

The temple complex includes two large straight-sided shikhara towers, the largest over 55 metres (180 feet) high. This is a stylistic feature that has continued in Jain and Hindu temples to the present day, and influenced Buddhist architecture in other countries, in forms like the pagoda.

== The Buddha ==

Traditional accounts say that, around 589 BCE, Siddhartha Gautama, a young prince who saw the suffering of the world and wanted to end it, reached the forested banks of the Phalgu river, near the city of Gaya, India. There he sat in meditation under a peepul tree (&quot;Ficus religiosa&quot; or Sacred Fig) which later became known as the Bodhi Tree. According to Buddhist scriptures, after three days and three nights, Siddharta attained enlightenment and freedom from suffering. In that location, Mahabodhi Temple was built by Emperor Ashoka in around 260 BCE.
The Buddha then spent the succeeding seven weeks at seven different spots in the vicinity meditating and considering his experience. Several specific places at the current Mahabodhi Temple relate to the traditions surrounding these seven weeks:

* The first week was spent under the Bodhi tree.
* During the second week, the Buddha remained standing and stared, uninterrupted, at the Bodhi tree. This spot is marked by the Animeshlocha Stupa, that is, the unblinking stupa or shrine, to the northeast of the Mahabodhi Temple complex. There stands a statue of Buddha with his eyes fixed towards the Bodhi Tree.
* The Buddha is said to have walked back and forth between the location of the Animeshlocha Stupa and the Bodhi Tree. According to legend, lotus flowers sprung up along this route; it is now called Ratnachakrama or the jewel walk.
* He spent the fourth week near Ratnagar Chaitya, to the northeast side.
* He spent the sixth week next to the Lotus pond.
* He spent the seventh week under the &quot;Rajyatna&quot; tree.

==Mahabodhi tree==

The Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya is said to be a direct descendant of the original tree at Bodh Gaya that the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, meditated under when he attained enlightenment or omniscient wisdom. The temple was built directly to the east of the tree.

According to Buddhist mythology, if no Bodhi tree grows at the site, the ground around the Bodhi tree is devoid of all plants for a distance of one royal karīsa. Through the ground around the Bodhi tree no being, not even an elephant, can travel.

According to the Jatakas, the navel of the earth lies at this spot, and no other place can support the weight of the Buddha&#x27;s attainment. Another Buddhist tradition claims that when the world is destroyed at the end of a kalpa, the Bodhimanda is the last spot to disappear, and will be the first to appear when the world emerges into existence again. Tradition also claims that a lotus will bloom there, and if a Buddha is born during the new kalpa, the lotus flowers bloom in accordance with the number of Buddhas expected to arise. According to legend, in the case of Gautama Buddha, a Bodhi tree sprang up on the day he was born.

== Temple construction ==
===Mauryan establishment===

In approximately 250 BCE, about 200 years after the Buddha attained enlightenment , Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan Empire visited Bodh Gaya in order to establish a monastery and shrine on the holy site, which has today disappeared.

There remains however the Diamond throne, which he had established at the foot of the Bodhi Tree. The Diamond throne, or &quot;Vajrasana&quot;, is thought to have been built by Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya Empire between 250 and 233 BCE, at the location where the Buddha reached enlightenment. It is worshipped today, and is the centre of many festivities at the temple.

Representations of the early temple structure meant to protect the Bodhi Tree are found at Sanchi, on the toraṇas of Stūpa I, dating from around 25 BCE, and on a relief carving from the stupa railing at Bhārhut, from the early Shunga period (c. 185–c. 73 BCE).

===Sunga structures===
====Columns with pot-shaped bases====
Additional structures were brought in by the Sungas. In particular, columns with pot-shaped bases were found around the Diamond throne. These columns are thought to date to the 1st century BCE, towards the end of the Sungas. These columns, which were found through archaeological research at the Buddha&#x27;s Walk in the Mahabodhi Temple, quite precisely match the columns described on the reliefs found on the gateway pillars.

====Railings====
The railings around the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya are ancient. They are old sandstone posts dating about 150 BCE, during the Sunga period. There are carved panels as well as medallions, with many scenes similar to those of the contemporary Sunga railings at Bharhut (150 BCE) and Sanchi (115 BCE), although the reliefs at Sanchi Stupa No.2 are often considered the oldest of all. The railing was extended during the following century, down to the end of Gupta period (7th century), with coarse granite decorated with elaborate foliate ornaments and small figures as well as stupas. Many parts of the initial railing have been dismantled and are now in museums, such as the Indian Museum in Kolkata, and have been replaced by plaster copies.
===Current pyramidal temple===

While Asoka is considered the Mahabodhi Temple&#x27;s founder, the current pyramidal structure dates from the Gupta Empire, in the 5th–6th century CE. It&#x27;s identical to the architectural styles of Hindu temples still being constructed in India.

However, this may represent a restoration of earlier work of the 2nd or 3rd century: a plaque from Kumrahar dated 150–200 CE, based on its dated Kharoshthi inscriptions and combined finds of Huvishka coins, already shows the Mahabodhi Temple in its current shape with a stepped truncated pyramid and a small hemispherical stupa with finials on top. This is confirmed by archaeological excavations in Bodh Gaya.

It is thought that the temple in the shape of a truncated pyramid was derived from the design of the stepped stupas which had developed in Gandhara. The Mahabodhi Temple adapted the Gandharan design of a succession of steps with niches containing Buddha images, alternating with Greco-Roman pillars, and top by a stupa, as seen in the stupas of Jaulian. The structure is crowned by the shape of a hemispherical stupa topped by finials, forming a logical elongation of the stepped Gandharan stupas.

This truncated pyramid design also marked the evolution from the aniconic stupa dedicated to the cult of relics, to the iconic temple with multiple images of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas. This design was very influential in the development of later Hindu temples. The &quot;shikhara&quot; tower with an amalaka near the top is today considered more characteristic of Hindu temples.

The Temple was restored by the British and India post-independence.

==Patronage==
Throughout its history, the Mahabodhi Temple has been the sight of patronage from various sources. Faxian in the 5th century, stated that there were three monasteries built around the temple complex with monks residing in them. These monks were supported by local people who provided them with food and other necessities. 
The patronage came from both within and outside of India. The vast number of votive stupas and sculptures that have been found within the Mahabodhi Temple complex are testament to this. A sixth-century donative record of a Sri Lankan monk named &quot;Mahānāman&quot; states that a temple was built at the Bodhimaṇḍa and attests to ties between the Mahabodhi Temple and Sri Lanka.

From the eleventh-century onwards, patronage increased from countries like Tibet, China, Sri Lanka and Burma. King Kyansittha sent the first Burmese expedition to the Mahabodhi Temple during this period. Three additional missions also took place up to the fourteenth century. The purpose of these missions seems to have been to carry out repairs on the temple structure while also sending gifts among which were musical instruments. Donations also came from non-royal sources. So far, five Chinese inscriptions have been found at the temple complex which records gifts by Chinese monks in the eleventh century. One of these monks stated in their inscription that they were sent on behalf of the Song Emperor. Local polities like the Pithipatis of Bodh Gaya also played a role in patronising the temple.

== Decline ==
Buddhism declined when the dynasties patronizing it declined, following Huna invasions and the early Arab Islamic invasions such as that of Muhammad bin Qasim. A strong revival occurred under the Pala Empire in the northeast of the subcontinent (where the temple is situated). Mahayana Buddhism flourished under the Palas between the 8th and the 12th century. However, after the defeat of the Palas by the Sena dynasty, Buddhism&#x27;s position again began to erode and became nearly extinct in India. During the 12th century CE, Bodh Gaya and the nearby regions were invaded and destroyed by Muslim Turk armies, led by Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s Qutb al-Din Aibak and Bakhtiyar Khilji. During this period, the Mahabodhi Temple fell into disrepair and was largely abandoned. The last abbot of the Mahabodhi Temple was Sariputra, who left India and travelled to Nepal in the 15th century. Over the following centuries, the monastery&#x27;s abbot or mahant position became occupied by the area&#x27;s primary landholder, who claimed ownership of the Mahabodhi Temple grounds.

In the 13th century, Burmese Buddhists built a temple with the same name and modelled on the original Mahabodhi Temple.

== Mucalinda Lake ==

It is said that six weeks after the Buddha began meditating under the Bodhi Tree, the heavens darkened for seven days, and a prodigious rain descended. However, the mighty king of serpents, Mucalinda, came from beneath the earth and protected with his hood the one who is the source of all protection. When the great storm had cleared, the serpent king assumed his human form, bowed before the Buddha, and returned in joy to his palace.

The subject of Buddha meditating under the protection of Mucalinda is very common in Iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand. One modern rendition is present in Bunleua Sulilat&#x27;s sculpture park Sala Keoku.

== Restoration ==


During the 13th century and again in the 19th century, Burmese rulers undertook restoration of the temple complex and surrounding wall. In the 1880s, the then-British colonial government of India began to restore Mahabodhi Temple under the direction of Sir Alexander Cunningham and Joseph David Beglar. In 1884, a large Buddha image of the Pāla period, likely removed at an earlier stage to the Mahant&#x27;s residence from the temple sanctum, was reinstated. The plith of the image was reconstructed at the time and parts of the dedicatory inscription inserted in their current position. The inscription records the rededication of the image by Pīṭhīpati Jayasena in the 13th century. In 1886, Sir Edwin Arnold visited the site and under guidance from Ven. Weligama Sri Sumangala published several articles drawing the attention of the Buddhists to the deplorable conditions of Buddhagaya. The sculpture has since been repaired, painted and gilded and is under active worship in the sanctum. 

== Architectural style ==

Mahabodhi Temple is constructed of brick and is one of the oldest brick structures to have survived in eastern India. It is considered to be a fine example of Indian brickwork, and was highly influential in the development of later architectural traditions. According to UNESCO, &quot;the present temple is one of the earliest and most imposing structures built entirely in brick from Gupta period&quot; (300–600 CE). Mahabodhi Temple&#x27;s central tower rises , and were heavily renovated in the 19th century. The central tower is surrounded by four smaller towers, constructed in the same style.

The Mahabodhi Temple is surrounded on all four sides by stone railings, about two metres high. The railings reveal two distinct types, both in style as well as the materials used. The older ones, made of sandstone, date to about 150 BCE, and the others, constructed from unpolished coarse granite, are believed to be of the Gupta period. The older railings have scenes such as Lakshmi, the Hindu/Buddhist goddess of wealth, being bathed by elephants; and Surya, the Hindu sun god, riding a chariot drawn by four horses. The newer railings have figures of stupas (reliquary shrines) and garudas (eagles). Images of lotus flowers also appear commonly.

Images of the site include Avalokiteśvara (Padmapani, Khasarpana), Vajrapani, Tara, Marichi, Yamantaka, Jambhala and Vajravārāhī.

== Control of the site ==
For centuries before its re-&quot;discovery&quot; by Europeans, the temple was an active place of worship by Shaivite and Vaishnavas.
In 1891, a campaign was initiated, seeking the return of control of the temple to Buddhists, over the objections of the Hindu mahant. Sir Edwin Arnold, author of &quot;The Light of Asia&quot;, started advocating for the renovation of the site and its return to Buddhist care. Arnold was directed towards this endeavour by Weligama Sri Sumangala Thera. In 1891, Anagarika Dharmapala was on a pilgrimage to the recently restored Mahabodhi Temple. Here he experienced a shock to find the temple in the hands of a Saivite priest, the Buddha image transformed into a Hindu icon and Buddhists barred from worship. As a result, he began an agitation movement.

The Maha Bodhi Society at Colombo was founded in 1891 but its offices were soon moved to Calcutta the following year in 1892. One of its primary aims was the restoration to Buddhist control of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the chief of the four ancient Buddhist holy sites. To accomplish this, Dharmapala initiated a lawsuit against the Brahmin priests who had held control of the site for centuries. After a protracted struggle, this was successful only after Indian independence (1947) and sixteen years after Dharmapala&#x27;s own death (1933), with the partial restoration of the site to the management of the Maha Bodhi Society in 1949. It was then the temple management of Bodh Gaya was entrusted to a committee composed of equal numbers of Hindus and Buddhists. The campaign was partially successful in 1949 when control passed from the Hindu mahant to the state government of Bihar, which established a Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) under the Bodh Gaya Temple Act of 1949. The committee has nine members, a majority of whom, including the chairman, must by law be Hindus. Mahabodhi&#x27;s first head monk under the management committee was Anagarika Munindra, a Bengali man who had been an active member of the Maha Bodhi Society.

In 2013, the Bihar government amended the Bodh Gaya Temple Act of 1949, allowing for a non-Hindu to head the temple committee. Also in 2013, one thousand Indian Buddhists protested at the Mahabodhi Temple site to demand that control over it be given to Buddhists. These Buddhists included such leaders as Bhante Anand (president of the Akhil Bharatiya Bhikkhu Mahasangh, an influential body of monks), as well as the president of the Bodh Gaya Mukti Andolan Samiti. Additionally, Japanese-born Surai Sasai emerged as an important Buddhist leader in India as both he and Bhante Anand became two of the most well-known leaders of this campaign to free the temple from Hindu control.

== Current status and management ==

The Bihar state government assumed responsibility for the protection, management, and monitoring of the temple and its properties when India gained its independence. Pursuant to the Bodh Gaya Temple Act of 1949, such responsibilities are shared with the Bodhgaya Temple Management Committee, and an advisory board. The committee, which serves for a 
three-year term, must by law consist of four Buddhist and four Hindu representatives, including the head of Sankaracharya Math monastery as an ex-officio Hindu member. A 2013 Amendment to the Bodhgaya Temple Management Act allows the Gaya District Magistrate to be the chairman of the committee, even if he is not Hindu. The advisory board consists of the governor of Bihar and twenty to twenty-five other members, half of them from foreign Buddhist countries.

In June 2002, the Mahabodhi Temple became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. All finds of religious artefacts in the area are legally protected under the Treasure Trove Act of 1878.

The temple&#x27;s head monk, Bhikkhu Bodhipala, resigned in 2007 after he was charged with cutting the branches of Mahabodhi tree on a regular basis and selling them to foreigners for significant amounts of money. A newspaper alleged that wealthy Thai buyers bought a branch with the cooperation of senior members of the temple&#x27;s management committee. While the temple&#x27;s spokesman stated that botanists had pruned the tree, the Bihar home secretary ordered the tree examined. A criminal charge was filed against Bodhipala. If convicted, Bodhipala would be subject to at least 10 years&#x27; imprisonment.

Following the expiration of the committee&#x27;s term in September 2007, Bihar&#x27;s government delayed appointing a new Committee and the district magistrate administered the temple pending such appointment. Eventually, on May 16, 2008, the government announced the appointment of a new Temple Management Committee.

, the Temple&#x27;s head monk was Bhikkhu Chalinda.

==Recent events==
In 2013, the upper portion of the temple was covered with 289 kg of gold. The gold was a gift from the King of Thailand and devotees from Thailand and installed with the approval of the Archaeological Survey of India.

=== 2013 attack ===

On 7 July 2013, ten low-intensity bombs exploded in the temple complex, injuring 5 people. One bomb was near the statue of Buddha and another was near the Mahabodhi tree. Three unexploded bombs were also found and defused. The blasts took place between 5.30 a.m. and 6.00 a.m. The main temple was undamaged. The Intelligence Bureau of India may have alerted state officials of possible threats around 15 days prior to the bombing. On 4 November 2013, the National Investigation Agency announced that the Islamic terrorist group Indian Mujahideen was responsible for the bombings.

<text>The Church of God, with headquarters in Cleveland, Tennessee, United States, is an international Holiness-Pentecostal Christian denomination. The Church of God&#x27;s publishing house is Pathway Press.

==Name==

The precise legal name of this body is &quot;Church of God&quot;. After a protracted court case involving donations intended for the use of its orphanages being received by other groups using the same name, the Supreme Court of Tennessee determined that it alone was entitled to use the simple name Church of God in 1953.

==History==

===Origins (1886–1902)===
R. G. Spurling (1857–1935), a Missionary Baptist minister, and his father Richard Spurling (1810–91), an ordained elder, rejected some of the views of the Baptists in his area as not being in accord with New Testament Christianity. R. G. Spurling disagreed with Landmarkism, an ecclesiology which held that only churches descending from churches with Baptist doctrine were part of the true Church, and that they should not associate with Christians of other traditions. Spurling felt that there needed to be another reformation of the Church that went beyond the Protestant Reformation so that Christians would be united together by love and not by creeds, which he believed were divisive. As long as something was not contrary to the New Testament, believers should be able to practice their faith in the form they chose.

Even though not intending to form a new church or denomination, their rejection of Landmarkist values placed them in conflict with traditional churches in that area. Within a short period of time, it became clear that they would not be allowed to remain as members of their churches. After being barred from his local Baptist church, R.G. Spurling and eight others organized the Christian Union at the Barney Creek Meeting House on August 19, 1886 in Monroe County, Tennessee. They agreed to free themselves from man-made creeds and unite upon the principles of the New Testament. Spurling organized three other congregations between 1889 and 1895, all with the name Christian Union, each functioning independently under Baptist polity. While this group would later disband and its members return to their original churches, the Church of God traces its origins to this 1886 meeting.

In 1896, three Tennessee evangelists (William Martin, Joe M. Tipton, and Milton McNabb) with links to Benjamin H. Irwin&#x27;s Fire-Baptized Holiness Church brought the message of entire sanctification to the western North Carolina countryside when they held a revival in the Shearer Schoolhouse near Camp Creek in Cherokee County. A feature of this revival was that some participants, including children, spoke in tongues when they experienced sanctification (this was later understood to be the baptism of the Holy Ghost, as spoken of in Acts 2). This phenomenon caused great excitement and controversy in the community, and leading Baptist and Methodist leaders soon denounced the revival. Several of the worshiper&#x27;s homes, as well as a provisional meeting house were burned by mobs opposing the new revival.

The worshipers began to meet in the house of William F. Bryant (1863–1949), a Baptist deacon prior to his joining the holiness movement, who assumed leadership of the group. R.G. Spurling often worshiped with the small fellowship and was the driving force behind its 1902 decision to organize into a church, called the Holiness Church at Camp Creek. Organization was made necessary because Irwin&#x27;s more fanatical teachings were influencing the movement, and there was a need for authority to discipline erring members.

===Tomlinson era (1903–1923)===
It would be Ambrose Jessup Tomlinson and his organizational skills, however, that would be responsible for the growth of the Camp Creek Holiness Church into a national denomination. A Quaker and colporteur (the publishing and distribution of religious materials) for the American Bible Society, Tomlinson had received the sanctification experience (but had not spoken in tongues) and had connections with Frank Sandford&#x27;s Shiloh church in Durham, Maine. While not an ordained minister, churches often invited him to preach. The church at Camp Creek had known Tomlinson for seven years before they asked him to join their church in 1903. After climbing what is now known as Prayer Mountain in Murphy, North Carolina (located within the Fields of the Wood park), and reportedly being divinely assured that this fledgling church was indeed God&#x27;s reestablishment of the New Testament church, Tomlinson joined the church and was soon elected its pastor. This allowed Spurling and Bryant to pursue evangelism. Fourteen new members were added to the church in the first year of Tomlinson&#x27;s pastorate, and other churches were soon established in Georgia and Tennessee.

By 1905, there was a desire for greater organization among the churches. Delegates from four churches met at Camp Creek (approximately a mile northwest of Fields of the Wood) in January 1906 to conduct the 1st General Assembly of the &quot;Churches of East Tennessee, North Georgia, and Western North Carolina.&quot; Though the intention was still to avoid the creation of a creed and denomination, the members&#x27; consensus on certain endeavors and standards laid the groundwork for the future denomination. The Assembly declared, &quot;We hope and trust that no person or body of people will ever use these minutes, or any part of them, as articles of faith upon which to establish a sect or denomination,&quot; and that the General Assembly was not &quot;a legislative or executive body, [but] judicial only.&quot; The 1st Assembly decided that foot washing was on the same level as the sacrament of communion and, like other holiness groups, condemned the use of tobacco. Tomlinson served as moderator and secretary. The name &quot;Church of God&quot; was adopted in 1907, and Tomlinson was elected general overseer in 1909.

The Church of God was a part of the holiness movement and believed in entire sanctification as a definite experience occurring after salvation. While individuals had spoken in tongues in the 1896 revival, tongues were not yet understood by the Church of God to be the initial evidence of baptism in the Holy Spirit. As news of the Azusa Street Revival began to spread and reach the Southeast, Church of God adherents began, more and more, to seek and obtain Spirit baptism. Tomlinson was one of these seekers. In June 1907, he traveled to Birmingham, Alabama, to attend a meeting of M. M. Pinson and Gaston B. Cashwell. Cashwell had returned to the South after being baptized in the Spirit at Azusa Street, spreading the revival and bringing many holiness groups into the Pentecostal fold. Tomlinson invited Cashwell to preach in Cleveland, Tennessee. It was there, under Cashwell&#x27;s preaching, that Tomlinson received the Pentecostal blessing. After Tomlinson&#x27;s experience, the Church of God&#x27;s emphasis changed from being mainly holiness in nature, to being both holiness and Pentecostal, and it has identified that way ever since.

In 1910, the official publication, &quot;The Church of God Evangel,&quot; was founded, and it remains the oldest continuous Pentecostal publication. Growth followed in the years after organization. There was one church with 20 members in 1902. By 1910, there were 1,005 members in 31 churches throughout the Southeastern United States.

==Statistics==
The denomination reported that in 2024, they had 47,897 churches and 9.2 million members and over 15 million worship attenders in 197 countries. The United States Religion Census of 2010 found that there were 1,109,992 members and 6,100 churches in the US.
In 2020, the United States Religion Census found that there were 868,446 members and 5,921 churches in the US. A small decline from the 2010 figures. 

==Clergy==
The Church of God recognizes three ranks of credentialed ministers: Exhorter (initial level), Ordained Minister (intermediate level), and Ordained Bishop (highest level). Exhorters are authorized to preach, serve as evangelists, and serve as pastor of a church. Ordained Ministers are further authorized to baptize converts, receive new church members, administer sacraments or ordinances, solemnize marriages, and establish churches. In addition to the rights and privileges held by Exhorters and Ordained Ministers, Ordained Bishops are authorized to assist in ordination ceremonies. State/regional overseers are designated &quot;Administrative Bishops,&quot; International Executive Committee members as &quot;Executive Bishops,&quot; and the General Overseer as &quot;Presiding Bishop.&quot; Women are eligible to be Exhorters and Ordained Ministers; however, only men can become Ordained Bishops. There are also categories of Licensed Minister of Christian Education and Licensed Minister of Music.

== Beliefs ==
The church has a Pentecostal confession of faith known in the Church of God as the &quot;Declaration of Faith&quot;.

==Structure==

===International===
The Church of God is a hierarchical church with an episcopal polity. The Church of God&#x27;s highest judicial body is the International General Assembly. This body has &quot;full power and authority to designate the teaching, government, principles, and practices&quot; of the Church of God. Meeting every two years, the General Assembly&#x27;s voting membership includes all lay members, credentialed ministers of the Church of God, and members 16 years of age or older, but to vote one must be present and registered. The General Assembly is responsible for electing the church&#x27;s executive officers. These are the general overseer, the three assistant general overseers, and the secretary general. In addition, it elects the directors of the church&#x27;s missionary and Christian education ministries.

==Higher education==
The Church of God operates Lee University, a Christian Liberal Arts university in Cleveland, Tennessee, established in 1918. In response to the need for a graduate seminary, the Church of God Graduate School of Christian Ministries opened in 1975. Its name was changed to the Church of God School of Theology, Church of God Theological Seminary, and most recently to the Pentecostal Theological Seminary (PTS) with the hopes of appealing to a broader student base.

<text>Louis Joseph Robichaud (October 21, 1925 – January 6, 2005), popularly known as &quot;Little Louis&quot; or &quot;P&#x27;tit-Louis&quot;, was the second (but first elected) Acadian premier of New Brunswick, serving from 1960 to 1970.

With the Equal Opportunity program, the language rights act of 1969 establishing New Brunswick as an officially bilingual province, and for his role in the creation of the Université de Moncton, Robichaud is credited with ushering in major social reform in New Brunswick.

== Early life ==
Louis Joseph Robichaud was born on October 21, 1925, in a two-storey house in Saint-Antoine, New Brunswick.

==Life and achievements==
At the age of 14, Robichaud left home to enter the Juvénat Saint-Jean-Eudes in Bathurst to study for a career in the Church. After his third year at the school, he decided instead to pursue a political career. He attended the Collège du Sacré-Coeur (now part of the Université de Moncton) and graduated in 1947 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He then went on to study economics and political science at Université Laval. He articled with a law firm in Bathurst for three years and, upon being admitted to the bar, practised law for a short period of time in Richibucto.

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 1952 as the youngest ever Acadian member of the assembly to that date.

He became provincial Liberal leader in 1958 and led his party to victory in 1960, 1963 and 1967 before being defeated by Richard Hatfield&#x27;s Conservatives in the 1970 election.

Robichaud was the first Acadian Premier of New Brunswick since Peter J. Veniot and the first to win an election. He modernized the province&#x27;s hospitals and public schools and introduced a wide range of social reforms. The Liberals also passed the New Brunswick Official Languages Act (1969) making New Brunswick officially bilingual. &quot;Language rights&quot;, he said when he introduced the legislation, &quot;are more than legal rights. They are precious cultural rights, going deep into the revered past and touching the historic traditions of all our people.&quot;

Robichaud also restructured the municipal tax regime, ending the ability of business to play one municipality against another in order to extract the lowest tax rates. He introduced in 1963 the Municipal Capital Borrowing Act and Board, which is designed to act as a brake for spendthrift municipalities. He also expanded the government and sought to ensure that the quality of health care, education and social services was the same across the province—a programme he called Equal Opportunity, which is still a political buzz phrase in New Brunswick. &quot;When I first realized that there was absolutely no equal opportunity, no equality, in New Brunswick,&quot; he recalled in the 1980s, &quot;well, I had to come to the conclusion that something had to be done immediately.&quot;

A desk made for Robichaud by the Saint John Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company and given to him in 1966, which he used during his last years as premier and which was used by his successor Richard Hatfield was returned to the Premier&#x27;s Office by Shawn Graham in 2006.

He was instrumental in the creation of the Université de Moncton in 1963, while in 1969, a high school was named in his honour in Shediac, New Brunswick.

In 1971, upon resigning from the legislature, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada and Canadian chairman of the International Joint Commission, a post he held until being called to the Senate of Canada on December 21, 1973. He sat in the Senate until his mandatory retirement from the upper house on October 21, 2000 upon reaching his seventy-fifth birthday.

He was a resident of New Brunswick at the time of his death from cancer at the Stella-Maris-De-Kent Hospital in Sainte-Anne-de-Kent, near his birthplace of Saint-Antoine, New Brunswick. The cancer had been discovered only a few weeks before his death. He died on January 6, 2005.

<doc id="226070" wikidata="Q447011" url="?curid=226070" title="Dufferin Roblin">
<text>Dufferin &quot;Duff&quot; Roblin (June 17, 1917 – May 30, 2010) was a Canadian businessman and politician. He served as the 14th premier of Manitoba from 1958 to 1967. Roblin was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the advice of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. In the government of Brian Mulroney, he served as government leader in the Senate. He was the grandson of Sir Rodmond Roblin, who also served as Manitoba Premier. His ancestor John Roblin served in the Upper Canada assembly.

==Early life==
Roblin was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Charles Dufferin Roblin and Sophie Murdoch, and was educated at the University of Manitoba and the University of Chicago. He was a car dealer before entering politics, and served as a Wing Commander in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1940 to 1946.

Like his grandfather, Roblin was a member of Manitoba&#x27;s Conservative Party, which was renamed the Progressive Conservative Party in 1942. During the 1940s, the Manitoba Conservatives were part of a coalition government with the Liberal-Progressives, and Conservative leader Errick Willis was a prominent cabinet minister in the governments of John Bracken, Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell.

==Provincial backbencher==
There were opponents of the coalition in both the Liberal and Conservative ranks. Roblin was a part of the latter group and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1949 as an &quot;Independent Progressive Conservative&quot; opposing the coalition. Running in the multi-member riding of Winnipeg South, he finished well ahead of the official Progressive Conservative candidate and soon emerged as the leading voice for anti-Conservatives in the province.

Willis resigned as a cabinet minister in August 1950, and the Progressive Conservative delegates overwhelmingly voted to leave the coalition at their annual convention that year. Some party members tried to convince Roblin to stand against Willis for the leadership, but Roblin declined.

Roblin was re-elected for Winnipeg South in 1953, but the Progressive Conservative Party, as a whole, fared poorly by winning only 12 seats out of 57. Willis was blamed for the party&#x27;s loss, and another effort was made to draft Roblin as leader.

==Leadership win==
When Willis called a leadership convention for 1954, Roblin quickly declared himself a candidate. He built up a strong organization throughout the province and was able to defeat Willis on the second ballot. Roblin&#x27;s support came mostly from rural delegates. The Progressive Conservatives&#x27; grassroots network had atrophied during the coalition years, and for the next four years, Roblin was involved in the arduous task of rebuilding the party organization.

Ideologically, Roblin was a Red Tory. He opposed the cautionary small government ideology of Liberal-Progressive Premier Douglas Campbell and pledged to expand government services if elected.

==Premier==
Under Roblin&#x27;s leadership, the Tories became the largest party in the legislature at the 1958 provincial election, winning 26 seats. Roblin himself was elected for the new single-member constituency of Wolseley, located in the centre of Winnipeg. The Manitoba CCF agreed to tolerate a Tory minority government, and Roblin became premier—ending 35 years of Progressive/Liberal-Progressive government in the province.

His government quickly enacted a series of progressive reforms, which were supported by the CCF. Roblin was thereby able to build up a successful legislative record and won the support of many centre-left voters who were previously uncommitted. His government lost a parliamentary vote of confidence in 1959, but was re-elected with a decisive majority in the ensuing election later in the year, taking 36 out of 57 seats.

Roblin&#x27;s government upgraded highways, created parks, and built the Red River Floodway around Winnipeg, popularly known as &quot;Duff&#x27;s Ditch.&quot; It reintroduced French instruction in schools, modernized hospitals, expanded social spending, and strengthened social welfare programs. It also improved postsecondary education and promoted urban development by consolidating the various municipalities in the Winnipeg area into a single metropolitan entity. For primary education, Roblin&#x27;s ministry brought Manitoba&#x27;s system of one-room schoolhouses into the modern era by building consolidated schools.

The Progressive Conservatives were re-elected with landslide mandates in the 1962 and 1966 elections, and Roblin never faced any serious competition in his own riding.

==Federal politics==
Roblin resigned in 1967 to run for the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservative Party at its 1967 leadership convention. He ran a strong campaign but came second to Nova Scotia Premier Robert Stanfield.

Roblin was a candidate in Winnipeg South Centre for the 1968 federal election but lost to Liberal E.B. Osler by over 10,000 votes. Roblin was hurt by an unpopular provincial sales tax introduced by his government as well as the more general &quot;Trudeaumania&quot; phenomenon. After the election, he was named as vice-president of Canadian Pacific Investments. In 1970, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

In the 1974 federal election, Roblin ran for the House of Commons in the Ontario riding of Peterborough. He was soundly defeated by Liberal Hugh Faulkner and later referred to the entire campaign as a lapse in judgement.

In 1978, Roblin was appointed to the Senate by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, officially representing the Manitoba region of Red River. He was the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate during Joe Clark&#x27;s brief tenure as Prime Minister (1979–1980) and served as Deputy Opposition Leader from 1980 to 1984.

After Brian Mulroney&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1984 election, Roblin was appointed Leader of the Government in the Senate, and served in Mulroney&#x27;s cabinet until June 29, 1986. In that capacity, he was particularly interested in matters relating to African economic development.

Roblin retired from the Senate on June 17, 1992, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 75. He received the President&#x27;s Award of the Winnipeg Press Club in 1999, and published his memoirs (entitled &quot;Speaking for Myself&quot;) in the same year.

Roblin, a veteran of World War II who fought in the Normandy Campaign, represented Manitoba at the 60th Anniversary of D-Day in France. He, along with Prince Charles and the Prime Ministers of Canada and France, commemorated the Canadian Servicemen who were lost that day in 1944.

At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former provincial premier. Roblin died at the age of 92 on the afternoon of May 30, 2010 at the Victoria General Hospital. Upon his death, former provincial NDP leader Ed Schreyer said that &quot;Duff Roblin led a Conservative administration the likes we’ve not seen elsewhere in Canada and not likely to see again. It was positive in every respect. He brought Manitoba into the modern era, with desired changes in education, hospital finance, roads, social assistance and flood protection.&quot;

<text>Roméo-Adrien LeBlanc (December 18, 1928June 24, 2009) was a Canadian journalist and politician who served as 25th governor general of Canada from 1995 to 1999.

LeBlanc was born and educated in New Brunswick, and also studied in France prior to becoming a teacher and then a reporter for Radio-Canada. He was elected to the House of Commons in 1972, whereafter he served as a minister of the Crown until 1984, when he was moved to the Senate and became that chamber&#x27;s Speaker.

In 1995, he was appointed as governor general by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien, to replace Ramon John Hnatyshyn as viceroy, and he occupied the post until succeeded by Adrienne Clarkson in 1999, citing his health as the reason for his stepping down. His appointment as the Queen&#x27;s representative caused some controversy, due to perceptions of political favouritism, though he was praised for raising the stature of Acadians and francophones, and for returning Rideau Hall to the centre of life in Ottawa. 

On August 8, 1974, LeBlanc was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. He died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on June 24, 2009, aged 81.

== Youth and political career ==
LeBlanc was born on December 18, 1928 in Memramcook, New Brunswick, where he was raised, the youngest of seven children of Marie Lucie Claire LeBlanc and Philias LeBlanc. LeBlanc obtained bachelor degrees in arts and education from the Collège St-Joseph before studying French civilization at the Université de Paris. He then moved on to teaching for nine years at Drummond&#x27;s high school from 1951 to 1953 and the New Brunswick Teachers&#x27; College in Fredericton from 1955 to 1959 after which he obtained work between 1960 and 1967 as a journalist with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s French language broadcaster, Radio-Canada, serving in the bureaus in Ottawa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

His first marriage, to Joslyn &quot;Lyn&quot; Carter, with whom LeBlanc had two children (Genevieve and Dominic), lasted from 1966 to 1981; in 1994, he married Diana Fowler, who also had two children from a previous marriage.

LeBlanc stepped into the realm of politics when he became the press secretary for successive prime ministers Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau. He then went further, winning in the 1972 federal election a seat in the House of Commons as the Liberal Party representative for Westmorland-Kent, paving the way for his appointment as the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans in the Cabinet chaired by Trudeau.

LeBlanc was a key figure in Canada&#x27;s imposition of a 200-mile fishing zone; the establishment of a new fisheries licensing system; the widespread use of quotas and zones that protected Canadian fishermen from overexpansion and competition from trawlers owned by large companies; the owner-operator rule, requiring licence holders to operate vessels themselves; the separate-fleet rule, preventing corporations from obtaining licences for an under-65-foot fleet; and for creating an additional system of advisory committees that permitted fishermen a larger voice in fisheries management.

On one occasion, LeBlanc also persuaded Trudeau to advise the Governor General to close Canadian ports to Soviet fishing vessels, a headline-grabbing diplomatic thrust that resulted in better co-operation, and forbade all foreign corporations from holding commercial fishing licences in Canada.

On the Pacific coast, LeBlanc oversaw the creation of the Salmonid Enhancement Program, which aimed at doubling salmon production, and quelled plans by Alcan that were deemed to threaten salmon rivers at the time.

Late in 1982, LeBlanc became Minister of Public Works for two years before being nominated by Trudeau to then Governor General Jeanne Sauvé for appointment to the Senate on June 29, 1984. He was then selected in 1993 by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien as Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn&#x27;s appointee as that chamber&#x27;s speaker.

== Governor General of Canada ==
LeBlanc&#x27;s time as the Queen&#x27;s viceregal representative was considered to have been low key and largely uneventful, especially in comparison to that of his successor, Adrienne Clarkson. He was, however, the first governor general of Acadian heritage, which earned praise from the Acadian community, and he was also the first from the Canadian Maritimes to be appointed as viceroy.

=== As governor general-designate ===

It was announced from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada on November 22, 1994, that Queen Elizabeth II had approved Prime Minister Jean Chrétien&#x27;s choice of LeBlanc to succeed Ray Hnatyshyn as the Queen&#x27;s representative.

Thereafter, LeBlanc was invited to an audience with the Queen at Sandringham House, and he was said to have been impressed and inspired by the devotion to duty on the part of both Elizabeth and her mother.

The commission appointing LeBlanc under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada was issued on January 16, 1995.

The greatest publicity LeBlanc attracted in his career came immediately after the announcement of his appointment as Governor General: although previous honorees had worked as politicians prior to and after serving as viceroy, the recommendation of a prominent Liberal Party politician and organiser was criticised as being little more than a patronage gift from the Prime Minister to a loyal party member.

In the 1993 federal election, LeBlanc had been one of the chief architects of the Liberal Party&#x27;s election strategy, and was a strong party loyalist. In protest, both Reform Party of Canada leader Preston Manning and Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard refused to attend LeBlanc&#x27;s installation ceremony.

=== In office ===
As with each governor general, LeBlanc took on unofficial and personal mandates, choosing for himself: voluntarism, the teaching of Canadian history, Canada&#x27;s Aboriginal peoples, and the military. He spoke often about the generosity, tolerance, and compassion of Canadians, and admired the dignity and abilities of the common citizen.

To recognize the &quot;unsung heroes&quot; who volunteer their time and effort to help others, LeBlanc initiated in 1996 the Governor General&#x27;s Caring Canadian Award, and, on June 21, of the same year, was proud to issue a royal proclamation inaugurating National Aboriginal Day as an annual observance.

As well, in 1996 LeBlanc formed the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Excellence in Teaching Canadian History, in 1999 partnered with the Canada Council for the Arts to create the Governor General&#x27;s Awards in Visual and Media Arts, oversaw the issuance of the Governor General&#x27;s Canadian History Medal for the Millennium, and established the Governor General&#x27;s Millennium Edition of the Map of Canada, which was taken into space in 1999 by Julie Payette.

LeBlanc travelled to all parts of Canada and had a special affinity for small towns and cities, making himself particularly visible in those parts of Quebec after the province&#x27;s referendum on secession in 1995. He participated in more than 2,000 events, including the annual New Year&#x27;s Levée, which he moved to various locations around the country, seeing the party organised at Ottawa, Ontario, in 1996; Quebec City, Quebec, in 1997; Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1998; and St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, in 1999.

Over the same years, LeBlanc also had public access to Rideau Hall and its grounds expanded and improved including opening a dedicated visitors&#x27; centre in 1997 so that the number of visitors increased threefold to approximately 125,000 people per year. In keeping with his respect for the First Peoples of Canada, LeBlanc placed a totem pole and inukshuk prominently on the royal property.

Amongst numerous other official and ceremonial duties, the Governor General granted Royal Assent to amendments to the constitution on three occasions: April 21, 1997, December 19, 1997, and January 8, 1998, and also issued the royal proclamation announcing the creation of the territory of Nunavut on April 1, 1999. LeBlanc welcomed to Rideau Hall the Queen, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, along with a host of foreign dignitaries such as United States president Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary; King Hussein and Queen Noor of Jordan, and later Hussein&#x27;s son, King Abdullah II, and his wife Queen Rania; as well as President of South Africa Nelson Mandela; and President of China Jiang Zemin. Further, he undertook eight state visits, becoming the first governor general of Canada to make such trips to the Czech Republic, India, Pakistan, the Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Mali, and Morocco.

=== Legacy ===
As governor general, LeBlanc was viewed as having been a role model for Acadians, and was complimented for having drawn the attention of the country to Acadian history and culture. As such, he was seen as a symbol for reconciliation, given the past relations between the Acadians and the Canadian Crown&#x27;s predecessor. At the same time, LeBlanc was also credited for returning Rideau Hall to a status closer to that which it held a century previous, when it was the centre of life in the national capital.
Although LeBlanc enjoyed all the provinces and territories, his visits touching small towns as well as big cities, he travelled to events in his home province to a degree that some saw as disproportionate. Moreover, LeBlanc never sought media coverage, with the result that many Canadians were unaware of who he was, and his down-to-earth demeanour was thought by some to have been too &quot;folksy&quot; for the post. The accusations of political patronage also failed to evaporate during LeBlanc&#x27;s governorship; while LeBlanc was viceroy, his son, Dominic, continued to work for the prime minister&#x27;s office until 1997, when he ran for election to the House of Commons in LeBlanc&#x27;s old riding, where the Governor General had a series of events planned the very week he dropped the election writs. Further, LeBlanc&#x27;s daughter maintained employment as a political assistant to Liberal Cabinet ministers, and some of the Governor General&#x27;s staff had close Liberal Party connections.

Personal touches were also left on the symbol of the Canadian viceregal office, from which LeBlanc removed the claws and tongue of the crowned lion, saying that they were impolite and un-Canadian. Though the change did not gather much attention until near the end of LeBlanc&#x27;s tenure, the reaction, when it came, was generally unfavourable, and the modifications were undone by his successor.

== Post-viceregal life and death ==
After being released from the Queen&#x27;s service, LeBlanc returned to New Brunswick. There, after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, he died on June 24, 2009, in Grande-Digue.

He was, as is protocol for all incumbent and former governors general, accorded a state funeral, which took place on July 3 of the same year, in Memramcook. The casket&#x27;s path through the community was lined with officers from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, paying homage to LeBlanc&#x27;s time as minister of the Crown with that portfolio, and the sitting governor general, Michaëlle Jean, her prime minister, Stephen Harper, and LeBlanc&#x27;s former prime minister, Jean Chrétien, all attended.

Canada Post featured LeBlanc on a postage stamp released on February 8, 2010.

<doc id="226080" wikidata="Q185427" url="?curid=226080" title="Song of Roland">
<text>The Song of Roland () is an 11th-century based on the deeds of the Frankish military leader Roland at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in AD 778, during the reign of the Emperor Charlemagne. It is the oldest surviving major work of French literature. It exists in various manuscript versions, which testify to its enormous and enduring popularity in Medieval and Renaissance literature from the 12th to 16th centuries.

The epic poem written in Old French is the first and one of the most outstanding examples of the &quot;chanson de geste&quot;, a literary form that flourished between the 11th and 16th centuries in Medieval Europe and celebrated legendary deeds. An early version was composed around 1040 AD, with additions and alterations made up to about 1115 AD. The final poem contains about 4,000 lines.

==Manuscripts and dating==
Although set in the Carolingian era, the &quot;Song of Roland&quot; was written centuries later. There is a single extant manuscript of the &quot;Song of Roland&quot;. It is held at the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It dates between 1129 and 1165 and was written in Anglo-Norman. There are eight additional manuscripts and three fragments of other poems on the subject of Roland.

Scholars estimate that the poem was written between approximately 1040 and 1115 — possibly by a poet named &quot;Turold&quot; (&quot;Turoldus&quot; in the manuscript itself) — and that most of the alterations were completed by about 1098. Some favor the earlier dating, which allows that the narrative was inspired by the Castilian campaigns of the 1030s and that the poem was established early enough to be a major influence in the First Crusade, (1096–1099). Others favor a later dating based on brief passages which are interpreted as alluding to events of the First Crusade.

Relevant to the question of dating the poem, the term &quot;d&#x27;oltre mer&quot; (or &quot;l&#x27;oltremarin&quot;) occurs three times in the text in reference to named Muslims who came to fight in Spain and France. The Old French &quot;oltre mer&quot; (oversea, modern French &quot;outremer&quot;) was commonly used during and after the First Crusade to refer to the Latin Levant, which supports a date of composition after the Crusade. Those favoring an earlier dating argue that the term is used generically to refer to &quot;a Muslim land.&quot; It is possible that the bulk of the poem dates from before the Crusades, with a few additions from the time of the First Crusade.

After two manuscripts were found in 1832 and 1835 and published in 1837, the Song of Roland became recognized as France&#x27;s national epic.

==Critical opinions==

=== Oral performance compared to manuscript versions ===

Scholarly consensus has long accepted that the &quot;Song of Roland&quot; was at first performed orally in many different versions with varying material and episodes, which were fixed and harmonized in the textual form.

Early 19th century editors of the &quot;Song of Roland&quot;, informed in part by patriotic desires to elevate a distinctly French epic, could thus overstate the textual cohesiveness of the Roland tradition as they presented it to the public. Andrew Taylor notes, &quot;[T]he Roland song was, if not invented, at the very least constructed. By supplying it with an appropriate epic title, isolating it from its original codicological context, and providing a general history of minstrel performance in which its pure origin could be located, the early editors presented a 4,002 line poem as sung French epic&quot;.

===AOI===

Certain lines of the Oxford manuscript end with the letters &quot;AOI&quot;. The meaning of this word or annotation is unclear. Many scholars have hypothesized that the marking may have played a role in public performances of the text, such as indicating a place where a &quot;jongleur&quot; would change the tempo. Contrarily, Nathan Love believes that &quot;AOI&quot; marks locations where the scribe or copyist is signaling that he has deviated from the primary manuscript: ergo, the mark indicates the source is a &quot;non-performance&quot; manuscript.

==Plot==

The &quot;Song of Roland&quot;″s account of the Battle of Roncesvalles is not supported by history. According to Einhard&#x27;s &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot; from the late eighth century, the attackers were Basques seeking revenge against Charlemagne&#x27;s army for the looting of Pamplona. The following is the depiction in the poem itself, not a historical account.

Charlemagne&#x27;s army is fighting the Arab Muslims in Spain. They have campaigned for seven years, and the last city standing is Saragossa, held by King Marsile, who is pictured not as a Muslim, but a follower of Mahumet and Apollin. Threatened by the might of Charlemagne&#x27;s Franks, Marsile seeks advice from his wise man, Blancandrin, who counsels him to conciliate the Emperor, offering to surrender and giving hostages. Accordingly, Marsile sends out messengers to Charlemagne, promising treasure and Marsile&#x27;s conversion to Christianity if the Franks will go back to Francia.

Charlemagne and his men, tired of fighting, accept his peace offer and select a messenger to Marsile&#x27;s court. The protagonist Roland, Charlemagne&#x27;s nephew, nominates his stepfather Ganelon as messenger. Ganelon, who fears being murdered by the enemy and accuses Roland of intending this, takes revenge by informing the Saracens of a way to ambush the rear guard of Charlemagne&#x27;s army, led by Roland, as the Franks re-enter Francia through the mountain passes.

As Ganelon predicted, Roland leads the rear guard, with the wise and moderate Oliver and the fierce Archbishop Turpin. The Muslims ambush them at Roncesvalles and the Christians are overwhelmed. Oliver pleads with Roland to blow his horn to call for help, but Roland tells him that blowing his horn in the middle of the battle would be an act of cowardice. If Roland continues to refuse, Oliver will not let Roland see his sister again whom Roland loves the most. However, Archbishop Turpin intervenes and tells them that the battle will be fatal for all of them and so instructs Roland to blow his horn oliphant (an elephant tusk hunting horn) to call for help from the Frankish army. The emperor hears the call &quot;en route&quot; to Francia. Charlemagne and his noblemen gallop back even though Count Ganelon tries to trick them.

Roland&#x27;s Franks fight well, but are outnumbered, until almost all his men are dead and he knows that Charlemagne&#x27;s army can no longer save them. Despite this, he blows his oliphant to summon revenge, blowing so hard that his temples start to bleed. After a few more fights, Roland succumbs to his wounds and dies a martyr&#x27;s death. Angels lift his soul to Paradise.

When Charlemagne and his men reach the battlefield, they find the slaughtered bodies of Roland and his men. They pursue the Muslims into the river Ebro, where the Muslims drown. Meanwhile, Baligant, the powerful emir of Babylon, has arrived in Spain to help Marsile. His army encounters that of Charlemagne at Roncesvalles, where the Christians are burying and mourning their dead. The Franks fight valiantly. When Charlemagne kills Baligant, the Muslim army scatters and flees, leaving the Franks to conquer Saragossa. With Marsile&#x27;s wife Bramimonde, Queen of Saragossa, Charlemagne and his men ride back to Aix, their capital in Francia.

The Franks discover Ganelon&#x27;s betrayal and keep him in chains until his trial, where Ganelon argues that his action was legitimate revenge, not treason. While the council of barons assembled to decide the traitor&#x27;s fate is initially swayed by this claim, partially out of fear of Ganelon&#x27;s friend Pinabel who threatens to fight anyone who judges Ganelon guilty, one man, Thierry, argues that because Roland was serving Charlemagne when Ganelon delivered his revenge on him, Ganelon&#x27;s action constitutes a betrayal.

Pinabel challenges Thierry to trial by combat. By divine intervention, Thierry kills Pinabel. By this the Franks are convinced of Ganelon&#x27;s treason. Thus, he is torn apart by having four galloping horses tied one to each arm and leg and thirty of his relatives are hanged. Bramimonde converts to Christianity, her name changing to Juliana. While sleeping, Charlemagne is told by Gabriel to ride to help King Vivien and bemoans his life.

==Form==
The song is written in stanzas of irregular length known as laisses. The lines are decasyllabic (containing ten syllables), and each is divided by a strong caesura which generally falls after the fourth syllable. The last stressed syllable of each line in a laisse has the same vowel sound as every other end-syllable in that laisse. The laisse is therefore an assonal, not a rhyming stanza.

On a narrative level, the &quot;Song of Roland&quot; features extensive use of repetition, parallelism, and thesis-antithesis pairs. Roland proposes Ganelon for the dangerous mission to Sarrogossa; Ganelon designates Roland to man the rearguard. Charlemagne is contrasted with Baligant. Unlike later Renaissance and Romantic literature, the poem focuses on action rather than introspection. The characters are presented through what they do, not through what they think or feel.

The narrator gives few explanations for characters&#x27; behaviour. The warriors are stereotypes defined by a few salient traits; for example, Roland is loyal and trusting while Ganelon, though brave, is traitorous and vindictive.

The story moves at a fast pace, occasionally slowing down and recounting the same scene up to three times but focusing on different details or taking a different perspective each time. The effect is similar to a film sequence shot at different angles so that new and more important details come to light with each shot.

==Durandal==

According to the Song of Roland, the legendary sword called Durandal was first given to Charlemagne by an angel. It contained one tooth of Saint Peter, blood of Saint Basil, hair of Saint Denis, and a piece of the raiment of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and was supposedly the sharpest sword in all existence. In the story of the Song of Roland, the weapon is given to Roland, and he uses it to defend himself single-handedly against thousands of Muslim attackers. According to one 12th-century legend from the French town of Rocamadour, Roland threw the sword into a cliffside. A replication of the legendary sword can be found there, embedded into the cliff-face next to the town&#x27;s sanctuary.

==Historical adaptations==
A Latin poem, &quot;Carmen de Prodicione Guenonis&quot;, was composed around 1120, and a Latin prose version, &quot;Historia Caroli Magni&quot; (often known as &quot;The Pseudo-Turpin&quot;) even earlier. Around 1170, a version of the French poem was translated into the Middle High German &quot;Rolandslied&quot; by Konrad der Pfaffe (formerly thought to have been the author of the Kaiserchronik). In his translation Konrad replaces French topics with generically Christian ones. The work was translated into Middle Dutch in the 13th century.

It was also rendered into Occitan verse in the 14th- or 15th-century poem of &quot;Ronsasvals&quot;, which incorporates the later, southern aesthetic into the story. An Old Norse version of the &quot;Song of Roland&quot; exists as &quot;Karlamagnús saga&quot;, and a translation into the artificial literary language of Franco-Venetian is also known; such translations contributed to the awareness of the story in Italy. In 1516 Ludovico Ariosto published his epic &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, which deals largely with characters first described in the &quot;Song of Roland&quot;.

There is also Faroese adoption of this ballad named &quot;Runtsivalstríðið&quot; (Battle of Roncevaux), and a Norwegian version called &quot;Rolandskvadet&quot;. The ballad is one of many sung during the Faroese folkdance tradition of chain dancing.

== Modern adaptations ==
Joseph Haydn and Nunziato Porta&#x27;s opera, &quot;Orlando Paladino&quot; (1782), the most popular of Haydn&#x27;s operas during his lifetime, is based loosely on &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; via Ariosto&#x27;s version, as are Antonio Vivaldi and Grazio Braccioli&#x27;s 1727 opera and their earlier 1714 version.

The has an important place in the background of Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Confidential Agent&quot;, published in 1939. The book&#x27;s protagonist had been a medieval scholar specialising in this work, until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War forced him to become a soldier and secret agent. Throughout the book, he repeatedly compares himself and other characters with the characters of &quot;Roland&quot;. Particularly, the book includes a full two pages of specific commentary, which is relevant to its 20th-century plot line: &quot;Oliver, when he saw the Saracens coming, urged Roland to blow his horn and fetch back Charlemagne – but Roland wouldn&#x27;t blow. A big brave fool. In war one always chooses the wrong hero. Oliver should have been the hero of that song, instead of being given second place with the blood-thirsty Bishop Turpin. [...] In the Oxford version Oliver is reconciled in the end, he gives Roland his death-blow by accident, his eyes blinded by wounds. [But] the story had been tidied up. In truth, Oliver strikes his friend down in full knowledge – because of what he has done to his men, all the wasted lives. Oliver dies hating the man he loves – the big boasting courageous fool who was more concerned with his own glory than with the victory of his faith. This makes the story tragedy, not just heroics&quot;.

It is also adapted by Stephen King, in the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series in which Roland Deschain wishes to save the Dark Tower from the Crimson King, itself inspired by Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&quot;.

&quot;The Song of Roland&quot; is part of the Matter of France (the Continental counterpart to the Arthurian legendarium known as the Matter of Britain), and related to &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;. The names Roland and Orlando are cognates.

Emanuele Luzzati&#x27;s animated short film, &quot;I paladini di Francia&quot;, together with &quot;Giulio Gianini&quot;, in 1960, was turned into the children&#x27;s picture-story book, with verse narrative, &quot;I Paladini de Francia ovvero il tradimento di Gano di Maganz&quot;, which translates literally as &quot;The Paladins of France or the treachery of Ganelon of Mainz&quot; (Ugo Mursia Editore, 1962). This was then republished, in English, as &quot;Ronald and the Wizard Calico&quot; (1969). The Picture Lion paperback edition (William Collins, London, 1973) is a paperback imprint of the Hutchinson Junior Books edition (1969), which credits the English translation to Hutchinson Junior Books.

Luzzati&#x27;s original verse story in Italian is about the plight of a beautiful maiden called Biancofiore – White Flower, or Blanchefleur – and her brave hero, Captain Rinaldo, and Ricardo and his paladins – the term used for Christian knights engaged in Crusades against the Saracens (Muslims) and Moors. Battling with these good people are the wicked Moors – North African Muslims and Arabs – and their Sultan, in Jerusalem. With the assistance of the wicked and treacherous magician, Gano of Maganz, Biancofiore is stolen from her fortress castle, and taken to become the reluctant wife of the Sultan. The catalyst for victory is the good magician, Urlubulu, who lives in a lake, and flies through the air on the back of his magic blue bird. The English translators, using the original illustrations, and the basic rhyme patterns, slightly simplify the plot, changing the Christians-versus-Muslim-Moors conflict into a battle between good and bad magicians and between golden knights and green knights. The French traitor in The Song of Roland, who is actually Roland&#x27;s cowardly step-father, is Ganelon – very likely the inspiration for Luzzati&#x27;s traitor and wicked magician, Gano. Orlando Furioso (literally, Furious or Enraged Orlando, or Roland), includes Orlando&#x27;s cousin, the paladin Rinaldo, who, like Orlando, is also in love with Angelica, a pagan princess. Rinaldo is, of course, the Italian equivalent of Ronald. Flying through the air on the back of a magic bird is equivalent to flying on a magic hippogriff.

It appears in the 1994 video game &quot;Marathon&quot;, by Bungie, in the 13th level. Durandal is also the name of the main antagonist of the game.

On 22 July 2017 Michael Eging and Steve Arnold released a novel, &quot;The Silver Horn Echoes: A Song of Roland&quot;, inspired by the . This work is more closely based on a screenplay written by Michael Eging in 2008, simply known as &quot;Song of Roland&quot; and first optioned to Alan Kaplan at Cine LA that same year. The book explores the untold story of how Roland finds himself at Ronceveaux, betrayed by Ganelon and facing the expansive Saragossan host. Primary characters in the novel include Charles (Charlemagne), Ganelon, Bishop Turpin, Oliver, Aude, Marsilion, Blancandarin and others recognizable from the poem. Introduced in this tale are additional characters that inject intrigue and danger to the story, including Charles oldest son, Pepin, Marsilion&#x27;s treacherous son, Saleem, and the scheming Byzantine emissary, Honorius. The cover artwork was hand painted by Jordan Raskin. The authors determined when writing both the screenplay and the novel to remain in the world created by the poem; thus, Charles remains an older man near the end of his long reign rather than in 778 when the attack on the rearguard actually occurred. Further, this novel bookends the story with William the Conqueror&#x27;s use of the poem as a motivator for Norman forces prior to the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

In 2019, German folk rock band dArtagnan released &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot;, a modern adaptation of the &quot;Song of Roland&quot;. It has garnered over 1.8 million views on YouTube.

<doc id="226081" wikidata="Q1378274" url="?curid=226081" title="Peter Lougheed">
<text>Edgar Peter Lougheed ( ; July 26, 1928 – September 13, 2012) was a Canadian lawyer and Progressive Conservative politician who served as the tenth premier of Alberta from 1971 to 1985, presiding over a period of reform and economic growth.

Born in Calgary, Alberta, Peter was the son of Edgar Donald Lougheed and Edna Alexandria Bauld and grandson of Canadian Senator Sir James Alexander Lougheed, a prominent Alberta businessman. Peter Lougheed attended the University of Alberta where he attained his Bachelor of Laws while playing football at the University of Alberta before joining the Edmonton Eskimos of the Western Interprovincial Football Union for two seasons in 1949 and 1950. After graduating, he entered business and practised law in Calgary.

In 1965, he was elected leader of the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party, which held no seats in the legislature. He led the party back into the legislature in the 1967 provincial election as the leader of the Official Opposition, then elected as Premier with 49 of 75 seats in the 1971 election, defeating the Social Credit Party and ending the dynasty which had governed Alberta since 1935. Lougheed established a progressive conservative dynasty in the province that lasted until 2015, when the New Democratic Party won a majority government; at 43 years and 7 months it was the longest unbroken run in government for a political party in Canadian history. Lougheed led the Tories again to victory in 1975, 1979 and 1982, winning landslide majorities each time, with vote tallies of 57 to 63 percent of votes cast.

As premier, Lougheed furthered the development of the oil and gas resources, and started the Alberta Heritage Fund to ensure that the exploitation of non-renewable resources would be of long-term benefit to Alberta. He introduced the Alberta Bill of Rights. He quarrelled with Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s federal Liberal government over its 1980 introduction of the National Energy Program. After hard bargaining, Lougheed and Trudeau eventually reached an agreement for energy revenue sharing in 1981. Calgary&#x27;s bid to host the 1988 Winter Olympics was developed during Lougheed&#x27;s terms. Alberta also experienced economic success and went through significant social reform under the Lougheed administration.

From 1996 to 2002, Lougheed served as Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University. He sat on the boards of a variety of organizations and corporations. In a 2012 edition of &quot;Policy Options&quot;, the Institute for Research on Public Policy named Lougheed the best Canadian premier of the last forty years.

==Early life==
Edgar Peter Lougheed was born on July 26, 1928, in Calgary, Alberta, as the second biological son to Edgar Donald Lougheed (1893–1951) a lawyer from Calgary, and Edna Alexandria Lougheed () (1901–1972) of Halifax. Lougheed&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Sir James Alexander Lougheed (1854–1925) a Senator, federal cabinet minister in the Robert Borden and Arthur Meighen governments, and pioneer lawyer in Calgary.

Lougheed&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Belle Hardisty, was Metis by both her paternal and maternal lines. She was niece of Richard Hardisty (1831–1889), Canada&#x27;s first Métis Senator. He served in that chamber from 1888 to his death in 1889, when the seat was filled by Belle&#x27;s husband, James Lougheed.

James Lougheed, Peter&#x27;s grandfather, accumulated significant wealth in real estate and oil firms before his death in 1925. Much of James Lougheed&#x27;s oil securities were sold following his death to pay the estate tax. Although James Lougheed&#x27;s home Beaulieu went into tax recovery proceedings after his death, the City of Calgary permitted James&#x27; widow to continue to reside in the home until her death. The onset of the Great Depression resulted in lower demand for the family&#x27;s office real estate leading to financial difficulties for Edgar Lougheed and his family who continued to manage several properties. Many of Peter Lougheed&#x27;s early years were spent moving between rented homes and apartments in Calgary. The Lougheed family fortune recovered in the 1940s with growing demand for accommodation in the family&#x27;s real estate holdings.

Lougheed attended several schools in Calgary, including Strathcona School for Boys, Earl Grey School, Rideau Park School, and the Central Collegiate Institute. At the Central Collegiate Institute, Lougheed founded the students&#x27; union and became its first president.

After graduating from the Central Collegiate Institute in 1947, Lougheed enrolled at the University of Alberta where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1951 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1952. Lougheed was elected as the president of the Students&#x27; Union in 1951, defeating Ivan Head and two other candidates. In an interview for Wood&#x27;s biography of Lougheed, Head complemented Lougheed&#x27;s university campaign, recognizing Lougheed&#x27;s first-rate organizational abilities. Lougheed also served as the editor for the sports section for &quot;The Gateway&quot;, the University of Alberta student newspaper. While studying at the University of Alberta he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity, served as president and in Rutherford House for four years.

===Football career===

Despite his small stature, Lougheed took a strong interest in football in his youth. Prior to attending the University of Alberta, Lougheed played for the junior Calgary Tornadoes as a halfback. A sports writer of the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; described Lougheed as a &quot;speedy and elusive back&quot;, and the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; described him as &quot;gifted with the fine turn of speed&quot; and &quot;an elusive handful&quot;.

During his time as a student, Lougheed was also involved in football. He played for the University of Alberta Golden Bears and later for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Western Interprovincial Football Union for two years, in 1949 and 1950. Lougheed&#x27;s position with the Eskimos was as a punt return specialist.

===Post football===

On June 21, 1952, Lougheed married Jeanne &quot;Jeannie&quot; Estelle Rogers (1928–2020), whom he met while attending the University of Alberta. Jeanne was born in Forestburg, Alberta to Lawrence Rogers, a physician and Estelle Christena Gunston.

After finishing law school, Lougheed started working at the law firm of Fenerty, McGillivray and Robertson in Calgary. However, he had his sights set on Harvard University to pursue a Master of Business Administration, which he completed in 1954. While still a student at Harvard, Lougheed had a number of jobs including a brief time at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City, and a summer with Gulf Oil in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was during this time in Tulsa that Lougheed saw firsthand the aftermath of an oil boom town after the resource had been depleted. According to political scientist and biographer Allan Tupper suggested Lougheed drew parallels between Tulsa and a possible future for Alberta.

After completing his Master of Business Administration at Harvard, Lougheed faced a career crossroads. Lougheed was a staunch believer that people should avoid excessive specialization in favour of maximizing their diversity of experience, and he anticipated spending time in business, law, and politics. In pursuit of business, Lougheed accepted a position as a legal assistant with the Canadian construction firm, Mannix Corporation in June 1956, where he was eventually promoted to a corporate law and management position. Later in 1962, Lougheed left Mannix to establish an independent law practice, partnering with John Ballem who brought oil and gas experience and later adding Marvin McDill. Lougheed also served on several boards including the Calgary Stampeders football club, and the Calgary Stampede and Exhibition board in 1963. However, in the early 1960s, Lougheed began to turn his attention toward politics.

==Early political career==

Lougheed&#x27;s family history through his grandfather was rooted in the Conservative Party, and that motivated him to pursue a political career. However, during that time, Alberta was represented almost entirely by Progressive Conservatives in the House of Commons of Canada. Although this made federal politics an option, Lougheed saw it as a drawback; he considered the field of federal Progressive Conservatives politicians from Alberta to be crowded, and the life of a backbencher held little appeal for him.

Instead, he turned his attention to the provincial Progressive Conservatives. The party had not formed government since Alberta&#x27;s founding in 1905, and under leader Milt Harradence had captured a mere 13 per cent of the vote and no seats in the previous 1963 election. The party lacked a network of constituency associations capable of organizing a cohesive campaign. Lougheed sought to differentiate the provincial party from the federal Progressive Conservatives and felt voters should be well aware that he was the dominant figure for the party, and not the leader of the federal party.
Lougheed&#x27;s opposition and Alberta&#x27;s incumbent government, the Social Credit had won every election since 1935. The party was led by Premier Ernest Manning, who had held that role for several decades since he assumed the position in 1943. Manning was popular, and his party had received 55 per cent of the vote in the 1963 election to capture 60 of 63 seats in the legislature. Albertans however, were reluctant to support the Social Credit party at the federal level, instead electing Progressive Conservative candidates consistently. The provincial Social Credit constituency associations often shared the same members with the federal Progressive Conservatives.

Lougheed believed that the time was right for a change in Alberta&#x27;s political landscape. He thought that the Social Credit party was too rural and lacked assertiveness in intergovernmental relations. According to Lougheed, Alberta needed to be a senior partner in Confederation, but the Social Credit Party was not in touch with the province&#x27;s true potential to be a national leader. He resolved to win the leadership of the provincial Progressive Conservative party and to navigate it into government. Before the leadership convention, Lougheed travelled around the province eagerly meeting supporters and constituency members to build his support base. Lougheed also started to build a team of supporters who followed him throughout his career including Roy Deyell, Merv Leitch, and Rod McDaniel, who took prominent positions in the Progressive Conservative Party.

In March 1965, Lougheed emerged victorious in the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s leadership convention by defeating Duncan McKillop, a lawyer, who had previously run as the party&#x27;s candidate for Calgary Queens Park in the 1963 election. The only other candidate, John Scott, a town councillor from Edson who had also entered the race, withdrew on the first day of the convention. Lougheed was nominated from the floor by Lou Hyndman and Charles Arthur Clark, father of future prime minister Joe Clark. Although the Progressive Conservative Association did not release the vote totals, biographer David G. Wood claimed that Lougheed received 91 per cent of the delegates&#x27; votes.

After becoming the party leader, Lougheed&#x27;s first challenge was the 1966 by-election in Pincher Creek-Crowsnest following the death of the eighteen-year Social Credit representative William Kovach. Lougheed and his team campaigned vigorously for candidate Alexander Wells, but the Progressive Conservative finished third with 18.6 per cent of the vote, trailing both the successful New Democratic candidate Garth Turcott and the Social Credit candidate. Despite the defeat, Lougheed saw it as a minor setback.

During his time as leader of the Progressive Conservative Association, Lougheed took on the role of vice-president of the Calgary Olympic Development Association (CODA) for the Banff bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics, which was the eventual runner up bid in the International Olympic Committee vote behind Sapporo, Japan.

===1967 Alberta election===

Lougheed focused on building momentum for the next general election. In the May 1967 election, Lougheed and his supporters worked tirelessly to convince candidates to run in all 65 constituencies, however, the Progressive Conservatives were only able to nominate 47 candidates, two more than the Liberal Party, but less than a full slate put forward by the Social Credit Party and the New Democratic Party. Lougheed sought candidates who were already public figures, often meeting with editors of local weekly newspapers, mayors and presidents of boards of trade to determine who the community&#x27;s leaders were. As the writ came closer Lougheed and the Progressive Conservatives realized they could not form government and instead focused on a strategy of capturing Lougheed&#x27;s seat in Calgary-West and forming the opposition. The campaign created red, white and blue promotional materials with the slogan &quot;Alberta Needs an Alternative&quot;, while Lougheed&#x27;s own material added his personal slogan &quot;Let&#x27;s Start It in Calgary West&quot;.

Lougheed sought a public debate amongst the four party leaders, however as a long-time incumbent Manning was not willing to risk a debate which could not benefit him. Manning&#x27;s position on the debate changed when a group of Edmonton church leaders decided to host a leaders debate, Manning a devout Christian and host of &quot;Back to the Bible Hour&quot; radio broadcasts was forced to accepted the debate. Lougheed&#x27;s performance in the debate was lauded by the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; and was credited by biographer George Wood with the growth in the Conservative movement in the Edmonton area, including Don Getty&#x27;s improbable victory over Social Credit Education Minister Randolph McKinnon in Strathcona West. Other media began to take notice, including &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; which stated Lougheed was the only politician capable of having &quot;an outside chance of challenging Manning&quot;.

Lougheed was subsequently elected to the legislature in Calgary-West garnering 62 per cent of the vote, and the Progressive Conservatives captured 26 per cent of the vote province-wide with five other successful candidates. With six elected MLAs, Lougheed became Leader of the Opposition. The group of elected Conservatives known as the &quot;original six&quot; included Calgary MLAs Len Werry, and David Russell; Edmonton area MLAs Lou Hyndman and Don Getty, and the party&#x27;s only rural candidate and former federal Member of Parliament Hugh Horner. Following the 1967 election, the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; positively remarked on Lougheed&#x27;s success, stating that Albertans now had a responsible and credible alternative in opposition.

==Leader of the Opposition==

On February 15, 1968, the 16th Alberta Legislature gathered and Lougheed assumed his position as Leader of the Opposition, seated across the aisle from Premier Manning.

Ernest Manning, who had been Alberta&#x27;s Premier since 1943, was aware of the declining support for Social Credit. In the 1967 election, the party received a disappointing 44.6 per cent of the popular vote, the first time under his leadership that they had failed to secure at least 50 per cent. On September 27, 1968, Manning announced his intention to retire from public office. After a leadership contest, Harry Strom succeeded him as Premier on December 12, 1968. In an ominous sign of the rise of Lougheed&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives, the Social Credit party was defeated in the February 1969 by-election in Manning&#x27;s former constituency by Progressive Conservative candidate William Yurko. Yurko received 45.7 per cent of the vote compared to the Social Credit candidate&#x27;s 40.3 per cent.

As Premier, Strom was described by Lougheed biographer Allan Tupper as an &quot;easier opponent&quot; than Manning, although both Tupper and Wood considered Strom as an earnest individual of high integrity, but lacked dynamism, experience and shrewdness. One of the challenges Strom faced was the need to modernize the rural-focused Social Credit Party to better reflect the growing urbanization in Alberta, something he was not able to effectively accomplish. Furthermore, the Social Credit government was predominantly composed of older members, with the average MLA age in 1969 of 54 years of age, and 16 of the 54 members being above the age of 60. In contrast, the Progressive Conservative caucus had an average age under 40. Strom pressed for &quot;a new and more positive relationship with the federal government&quot;.

In the Legislature Lougheed oversaw daily caucus strategy meetings to plan and rehearse questions. Each day the Lougheed opposition prepared questions for only one government Minister, ignoring all other Ministers, with the target Minister changing each day. The strategy combined with Lougheed&#x27;s legal training and sophistication was effective at creating suspense and concern in the government caucus.

Lougheed&#x27;s success in Alberta was noticed by other conservatives across Canada, he was invited to be the keynote speaker by federal Progressive Conservatives at the 1968 convention in Toronto. During the 1970 spring session, Lougheed moved to position the Progressive Conservatives as a credible alternative to the Social Credit party. His party introduced 21 bills, an unusually large number for an opposition party in a Westminster system.

Through by-elections, Lougheed&#x27;s Progressive Conservative caucus further grew from the &quot;Original Six&quot; with the election of Robert Dowling in the October 1969 Edson by-election, Bill Dickie a long-time friend of Lougheed crossing the floor from the Liberals to join his caucus in November 1969, and Banff-Cochrane independent representative Clarence Copithorne joining the party in April 1971. This growth saw the Lougheed-led Progressive Conservatives enter the August 1971 election with 10 incumbents.

===1971 general election===
On April 27, 1971, the 16th Legislature was prorogued, and was dissolved three months later on July 22 with an election day set on August 30, 1971. Prior to the 1971 election, a number of changes to Alberta&#x27;s electoral process occurred. Electoral district boundaries were redrawn and the number of members to be elected was increased from 65 to 75. The &quot;Age of Majority Act&quot; lowered the voting age from 21 to 18 years.

Since mid-1970, the Progressive Conservative Party had been preparing for an election to be called. They established slogans and branding which was centrally controlled, unlike previous instances in Alberta where individual constituencies were free to develop their own materials. This centralization aimed to reinforce the party&#x27;s key messages and ensure repetition in the eyes of voters. An advertising budget of $120,000 () was set to provide $80,000 for television advertisements and the rest of other materials for constituencies across the province. Unlike Social Credit&#x27;s use of radio for the less outgoing Strom, Lougheed&#x27;s focus was on television. Lougheed&#x27;s team was careful with messaging, stressing the idea of the Progressive Conservative providing an &quot;alternative&quot; rather than &quot;opposition&quot;. Prior to the election, Lougheed went on a 40-day tour that brought him to each constituency to &quot;meet and greet&quot; with potential voters.

On August 30, Albertans went to the polls and elected Peter Lougheed&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Association. The Progressive Conservatives captured 49 of 75 seats in the 17th Alberta Legislature with 46.4 per cent of the popular vote. The victory included a complete sweep of 16 electoral districts in Edmonton and 9 of 13 in Calgary. Lougheed himself won his district with 55.2 per cent of the vote in Calgary-West.

Many observers argue that the Progressive Conservative victory in 1971 was primarily a result of Lougheed&#x27;s charisma, combined with growing urbanization and an out-of-touch Social Credit government. Lewis G. Thomas argues that Lougheed evoked an image of the traditional elite with his business background which appealed to the province which was undergoing economic growth and prosperity brought on by non-renewable resources, which contrasted the old-fashioned image of the social credit government. Other scholars share similar views that include Lougheed as the saviour of the urban middle class that was seeking a revigorated government aligned with the province&#x27;s new resource age. Edward Bell counters this argument stating that Lougheed&#x27;s victory in 1971 was in no way guaranteed before the writ was dropped. Bell argues the Social Credit&#x27;s poor relationships with unions and Strom&#x27;s weak campaign led to the progressive conservatives narrow victory of 5.3 percentage points. The media heralded Lougheed&#x27;s victory as an upset, with the &quot;Calgary Albertan&quot; claiming &quot;PC&#x27;s Pull Off Socred Upset&quot;, and the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; headline &quot;It Is &#x27;Now&#x27; for Lougheed; Stunning Alberta Upset Puts PC&#x27;s in Power&quot;.

==Premier (1971–1985)==

===Electoral history===

On September 10, 1971, Peter Lougheed was sworn in as Alberta&#x27;s tenth premier by Lieutenant Governor Grant MacEwan. Lougheed was set with a majority government in the legislature and a Social Credit opposition of 25 members, which would be the largest opposition Lougheed would face in his 14-year career as Premier.

In the leadup to the 1975 election, Lougheed enjoyed strong support in his constituency which allowed him to focus his campaign efforts across the province.
The Progressive Conservatives campaigned a platform on administrative competence and promises outlined in an unpassed 1975–1976 budget. Leaning on successful negotiations with the federal and Ontario governments and oil companies for the development of oil sands in the &quot;Winnipeg Agreement&quot; only 11 days before the legislature was dissolved. Other promises included the creation of the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, reduction of personal income taxes by at least 28 per cent, and increased social program spending, all of which were built on growing non-renewable natural resource revenue resulting from the 1970s energy crisis. Lougheed was the centre of the campaign evidenced by the Progressive Conservative slogans &quot;Lougheed Leadership&quot;, &quot;43 Months of Progress&quot;, and &quot;Vote Today for Alberta&quot;. While opposition criticism focused on Lougheed&#x27;s interference with the free market, which was exemplified by the 1974 purchase of Pacific Western Airlines for $37.5-million (equivalent to $-million in ) and significant government spending authorized through Order-in-Council instead of appropriations through the legislature, neither was effective for swaying voters. To no one&#x27;s surprise, the Progressive Conservative Party won a lopsided victory in 1975, capturing 62.7 per cent of the vote and 69 of 75 seats in the legislature. The &quot;Edmonton Report&quot; cover featured a caricature of Peter Lougheed following the victory accompanied by the title &quot;Peter The Greatest&quot;.

During the 1979 election, Lougheed and the Progressive Conservative party gained popularity, with Lougheed campaigning on the informal slogan &quot;79 in &#x27;79&quot; in reference to winning all 79 seats in the legislature. Although they received a slightly lower percentage of the popular vote than in 1975, at 57.4 per cent, they gained five additional seats for a total of 74 out of 79 seats in the legislature. The public was strongly supportive of Lougheed and the Progressive Conservatives, and headlines predicted that they would win with a comfortable majority. Meanwhile, the opposition leaders, including Grant Notley of the New Democratic Party, Nick Taylor of the Liberal Party, and Bob Clark of the Social Credit Party, did not publicly discuss the possibility of winning a majority out of concern that it would harm their credibility. Lougheed&#x27;s main concern was preventing complacency among candidates and volunteers, and he personally campaigned throughout the province to address these concerns.

The 1982 election marked Lougheed&#x27;s final as Premier. Lougheed utilized the constitutional debates and focus on Alberta&#x27;s complete control over natural resources to gain increased support from the electorates. The Progressive Conservatives improved their popular support to capture 62.3 per cent of the popular vote and 75 of the 79 seats in the legislature, a landslide victory and the second-largest majority government in Alberta&#x27;s history. During the election Lougheed noted it would be his last election. Lougheed focused his campaign primarily on provincial issues and refused to use the name of opposition parties, instead referring to them as &quot;knockers&quot;, and his Progressive Conservatives as &quot;doers&quot;. He declined any television or public debates, which led to Western Canada Concept leader Gordon Kesler to crash one of Lougheed&#x27;s events to challenge the Premier to a debate. Lougheed also pushed the same strategy for his candidates as previous years, requiring them to canvass door-to-door as if they were behind in the polls.

Lougheed announced his retirement from politics in on June 26, 1985. A number of candidates campaigned to succeed Lougheed as the leader of the Progressive Conservatives and Premier of Alberta. In the 1985 Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election original Progressive Conservative caucus from 1967 and later a longtime member of the Lougheed cabinet Don Getty defeated MLA Julian Koziak to become Premier of Alberta. Getty was officially sworn in on November 1, 1985, ending Lougheed&#x27;s term as premier.

===Alberta Legislature and governance===

After his election in 1971, Lougheed sought to increase contact between Albertans and legislators by addressing accessibility, visibility and accountability of the Legislative Assembly. In his government&#x27;s first Speech from the Throne, Lieutenant Governor Grant MacEwan spoke extensively of the principles of open government. One of Lougheed&#x27;s initial actions was installing cameras to record and broadcast meetings of the legislature beginning on March 15, 1972, and the beginning of the &quot;Hansard&quot; series to produce a written record of debates on March 8, 1972.

Lougheed&#x27;s government made significant transformations to policy and finance through the legislature. Several legislative policy committees were created in 1975 consisting of members of the Progressive Conservative caucus, and did not include members of the opposition. Lougheed also consistently funded programs using special warrants authorized by cabinet and issued by the Lieutenant Governor, these warrants were not included in any budgets provided to the legislature and were not made public until after the decision to spend was approved. Critics argued that the use of special warrants removed the ability of the opposition, members of caucus or the public to hold the government to account.

Lougheed&#x27;s popularity during his premiership resulted in progressive conservative majority governments with only a limited number of opposition members. Lougheed became creative to provide additional responsibility to members of his caucus, including mandatory caucus meetings which he chaired. In 1975 he removed the requirement for caucus to operate by consensus, owing to the large number of members, instead a vote was called on all issues, and Lougheed often required a two-thirds majority for important issues. Furthermore, Cabinet members were required to attend caucus meetings, and all members were seated in alphabetical order. Lougheed refused to use the term backbencher instead referring to caucus members as either &quot;ministers&quot; or &quot;private members&quot;. Non-political attendance in caucus meetings was limited to only four staff members from the Premier&#x27;s Office. Lougheed required legislators to seek caucus approval to miss caucus meetings or publicly dissent with a position of caucus, which required either a reason of conscience or a constituency issue. When Progressive Conservative member Tom Sindlinger publicly disagreed with matters related to the Heritage Savings Trust Fund, Constitutional patriation, and freedom of information, he was expelled from caucus and the Progressive Conservative Party.

When selecting members for his cabinet, Lougheed took the approach that first-hand knowledge may be a detriment to the success of the minister. Lougheed wanted ministers to take on the role without any preconceived notions. For instance Hugh Horner, a doctor, was appointed minister of agriculture and Lou Hyndman, a lawyer, was appointed minister of education. Lougheed completely shuffled his Cabinet upon re-election in 1975 and 1979, with no minister retaining the same portfolio. This changed after the 1982 election when he reappointed several ministers to the same portfolios. Lougheed also oversaw an expansion of the size of Cabinet, which assisted in providing regional representation.

Based on his experience in opposition, Lougheed named an opposition member as the chair of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. However, political scientist Engelmann called the appointment &quot;window-dressing&quot; as the committee consists of a majority of government caucus members, and prior to changes under Premier Don Getty in 1990, the chair was not permitted to present a report of the committee to the legislature.

===Energy policies===

Lougheed, while serving as the leader of the opposition, accused the Social Credit government of not ensuring Albertans received fair value from the exploitation of public non-renewable natural resources. As Premier, Lougheed implemented several policies to increase the value of Alberta&#x27;s resources, counter federal programs he viewed as threats and expand development in the oil sands.
Shortly after he was elected in 1972, Lougheed announced major changes to the province&#x27;s oil and gas royalty structures to increase Alberta&#x27;s share of resource revenue and entrench the provincial government&#x27;s control over those resources. The previous Social Credit government established a maximum royalty rate at 16.66 per cent, and Lougheed was willing to permit existing leases to continue until they expired and all new leases would be issued at a new higher rate. However, in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau implemented an expanded National Oil Policy which included an export tax on oil. This resulted in domestic oil prices below international levels, all of which disproportionally affected Alberta. Lougheed used the export tax to claim &quot;force majeure&quot; and cancel all existing oil and gas leases, and reissued them under the new higher royalty rate. These higher royalty rates became contentious later in 1974 when the federal government revised the corporate tax code to no longer permit petroleum companies to deduct provincial royalties from taxable income. Lougheed and Trudeau came to a compromise in early 1975 which allowed the gradual increase in domestic oil prices to near world prices, while creating a buffer to protect manufacturing centers and consumers.
The early 1970s brought the possibility of large-scale oil and gas exploration in the Athabasca oil sands through the Syncrude project. The major negotiations between the Government of Alberta and the consortium of Imperial Oil, Gulf Canada, Atlantic Richfield Canada, and Canada-Cities Service occurred in August 1973 and was led by Lougheed and Energy Minister Don Getty. Lougheed&#x27;s goals with Syncrude were to get the project off the ground with the province receiving a fair royalty, and Albertans having the opportunity to invest in the project. Lougheed negotiated the royalty to take a similar form to profit sharing and insisted the connecting pipeline be 80 per cent owned by the province, the site powerplant 50 per cent owned by the province, and an option to acquire a 20 per cent ownership stake in the Syncrude project at a later date. The Syncrude negotiations between the government and the consortium were tense, with Don Getty staging a walk-out following an ultimatum letter sent to the Province from the consortium. While an agreement was reached in late-August 1973 which met Lougheed&#x27;s intended goals, the project began to unravel one year later when in December 1974 Atlantic Richfield backed out of the project when cost estimates doubled. The project was not feasible without a federal government commitment for petroleum price assurances and financial backing. Lougheed and Getty met with other firms to fill Atlantic Richfield&#x27;s place, and in February 1975 the consortium met with the governments of Alberta, Ontario, and Canada in the neutral site of Winnipeg with negotiations including federal ministers Jean Chrétien and Donald Macdonald, Ontario contingent led by Premier Bill Davis, and the Alberta contingent led by Lougheed, Getty, Leitch and Dickie. The &quot;Winnipeg Agreement&quot; resulted in Ontario purchasing 5 per cent of the project, Alberta 10 per cent, and the federal government 15 per cent. Alberta also took full cost and ownership of the pipeline and powerplant through the Alberta Energy Company and provided a $200 million loan. A legacy of the Syncrude deal was the growth of Fort McMurray, a small community of 6,847 in 1971 that grew to 31,000 by 1981. Future developments in the Athabasca oil sands were not as successful for Lougheed, with the $13.5 billion Alsands project falling apart in 1982.

Lougheed sought greater provincial control over oil and gas resources and to reduce federal government incursions in natural resource development. Lougheed was successful in leveraged government investment in the place of private investment to achieve his goal. The province took administrative control over natural gas pricing with the &quot;Natural Gas Pricing Agreement Act&quot; and incorporated the Alberta Energy Company in 1974 to focus on petroleum, pipeline, and petrochemical processing. The establishment of the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission further expanded the government&#x27;s authority in the sale of non-renewable natural resources, as well as construction, purchasing, and leases related to petroleum facilities.

In 1980, the Trudeau government implemented the National Energy Program with the rationale that Canadian ownership and control of natural resources was paramount to national energy security. Trudeau also argued that Canada&#x27;s energy policy had become divisive and must achieve greater fairness in revenue sharing. While the program increased domestic price controls, the emphasis on revenue sharing and incentives for oil exploration on federally owned lands was viewed critically by Lougheed. Lougheed fought the program vigorously in the courts and in public, where he actively stoked Alberta nationalism in a television address claiming the program would bring more &quot;Ottawa&quot; to the province. Prior to the announcement of the National Energy Program, Lougheed had threatened to reduce Alberta&#x27;s production of oil and gas to counter any federal program to increase taxes. If Alberta reduced production, Central Canada refineries and other businesses would need to purchase foreign oil which would be heavily subsidized by the federal government, a cost that it could not afford to with a $13.7 billion deficit in 1980. Lougheed finally decided to exercise this authority to force Trudeau to concede some measures of the Program, and Lougheed announced on television a 60,000 barrel reduction to Alberta&#x27;s production of crude oil to take place over nine months beginning in April 1981, and the suspension of two oil sands projects. Lougheed however pledged that he would not allow a national oil shortage to occur, and would suspend the cuts if a shortage occurred. The threat was successful as negotiations between the federal and provincial governments to amend the National Energy Program proceeded in 1981 to remove certain unpalatable aspects for Alberta. Lougheed&#x27;s success in the &quot;Oil Accord&quot; was marked by a widely published photograph of a celebratory champagne toast with Trudeau and himself, Lougheed later admitted to regretting the toast.

Lougheed&#x27;s battle with the National Energy Program corresponded with the 1980s oil glut where energy prices dropped dramatically due to falling demand. Lougheed was forced to lower royalty rates through the Oil and Gas Activity Program and focused the government&#x27;s efforts on natural gas diversification to stem falling revenues and a declining economy. Finally, in March 1985, only months before his retirement Lougheed, British Columbia Premier Bill Bennett, Saskatchewan Premier Grant Devine, and federal Progressive Conservative Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Patricia Carney agreed to the &quot;Western Accord&quot; which removed the remaining aspects of the National Energy Program and returned the Canadian energy industry to market-driven prices.

Critics have argued that Lougheed undertook a hostile and polarizing campaign toward federal oil and gas policy which forced Albertans to choose between provincial and national citizenship. The growing hostility fueled Alberta separatism which most visibly manifested itself in the election of separatist Gordon Kesler to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 1982. Furthermore, when Alberta Conservative Joe Clark became prime minister for a short period in 1979–1980, very little was done in the way of aligning domestic oil prices with the higher international prices, in part due to the significant hardship the higher market prices would have on other provinces and Canadian consumers.

===Federal-provincial relations===

Lougheed&#x27;s provincial-dominated view of Canadian federalism remains one of his most visible and longstanding impacts on Alberta and Canadian history. Historian Michael D. Behiels compares Lougheed&#x27;s role in the repatriation of the Canadian Constitution to that of 19th-century Ontario Premier Oliver Mowat who helped transform John A. Macdonald&#x27;s vision of Canadian government into one of coordinated sovereign powers. Amongst his most significant accomplishments in the 1970–1980s constitutional debates was the inclusion of the amending formula based on Alberta&#x27;s proposal, which requires an amendment to the constitution to take place with the agreement of the federal government and at least seven provinces representing 50 per cent of the Canadian population. The amending formula also included an opt-out provision which requires the consent of the province if amendments affecting existing provincial rights were considered. Lougheed&#x27;s vision for the amending formula highlighted the rights of individual provinces rather than regions to ensure equity, and there would be no effective veto for a single province, which represented a major deviation from amending formulas proposed in prior constitutional talks. Along with the amending formula, Lougheed&#x27;s constitutional legacy includes the inclusion of the notwithstanding clause which provides legislatures with the authority to supersede certain provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Lougheed&#x27;s constitutional influence began following his election in 1971 through two actions, first by rejecting the basis of the proposed Victoria Charter, and second by creating the Ministry of Federal and Intergovernmental Affairs. The Ministry was tasked with overseeing all intergovernmental matters and grew into the center of the political battles between the provincial and federal governments. The Ministry proved effective and helped usher the transition of Alberta from a junior province into a leading province in constitutional debates.

Prime Minister Trudeau&#x27;s failure to gain support for the Victoria Charter did not deter him from continuing to push for major constitutional reform. Trudeau&#x27;s primary objective was to ensure the patriation of the Canadian constitution. Additionally, he aimed to introduce changes such as an acceptable amending formula, the establishment of a Charter of Rights, and the advancement of federal powers. Trudeau&#x27;s goals were in contrast with those of the provincial governments which were primarily led by Lougheed and Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, and later René Lévesque. Lougheed sought greater authority over natural resources, Senate reform and reforms to the Supreme Court, while Bourassa and Lévesque sought greater recognition of Quebec&#x27;s culture and language.

In late 1973, intergovernmental tensions were further inflamed in the wake of the oil crisis and the Trudeau government&#x27;s export tax on Alberta oil. Lougheed publicly described the export tax as the most discriminatory action in Canadian history. Trudeau&#x27;s actions further reinforced Lougheed&#x27;s position that Alberta would only support Constitutional changes on the condition that provincial jurisdiction over resources was maintained. At the 1975 First Ministers&#x27; conference, Trudeau discussed reopening constitutional discussions which were limited to patriation exclusively. While all Premiers agreed patriation was desirable, Lougheed led the Premiers in demanding a general review of the distribution of powers, control of resources, and duplication of programs. Trudeau followed up the 1975 conference by submitting to each province a draft proclamation which provided three options, simple patriation, patriation with the Victoria Charter amending formula, and patriation with an updated Victoria Charter. Lougheed rejected the proposal and found an ally with Bourassa who submitted his own list of constitutional demands which expanded provincial jurisdiction. In 1978, Lougheed&#x27;s government formally outlined the province&#x27;s position in the paper &quot;Harmony in Diversity: A New Federalism for Canada&quot; which included the requirement for federal-provincial division of power to be protected by an amending formula which requires the consent of the provinces whose rights are subject to change.

Following an unsuccessful First Ministers Conference in September 1981, Trudeau began the process of unilateral constitutional repatriation led by the federal government alone. Ontario and New Brunswick were supportive of the federal government while the remaining provinces formed what would be dubbed the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot;, whose positions were largely created by Lougheed. Reference questions were submitted to the Court of Appeals in Quebec, Manitoba and Newfoundland by their respective governments on the question of unilateral patriation. Lougheed brought forward a resolution in the Legislature stating Alberta would only support patriation if there were safeguards for provincial rights, no amendments would diminish provincial rights, and the federal government did not proceed unilaterally. Lougheed then boycotted parliamentary hearings on patriation and joined the other Premiers in warning Trudeau against patriation before the Supreme Court ruled on whether unilateral patriation was constitutional.

===Foreign affairs===

Lougheed spearheaded the provincial push for a fresh approach to bilateral trade at the national level, which ultimately came to fruition with the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement. During the 1985 First Ministers&#x27; Conference in Regina, Lougheed promoted the idea on television, highlighting the potential for Canadian entrepreneurs to participate in the North American market. Lougheed was meticulous in planning his visits to Washington, ensuring every aspect was perfectly executed, as was characteristic of his premiership. Canadian ambassador to the United States, Allan Gotlieb, who served from 1981 to 1989, praised Lougheed as one of the most effective Canadian politicians to work with Congress. Lougheed relied on his close relationship with Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson to gain access to elected officials in Congress during his initial trips to the U.S. Capital.

In 1979, Lougheed created the position of Minister of Foreign Trade and appointed Horst Schmid to the role. During his time in office, Lougheed undertook various official international trips, and he was often accompanied by his wife, Jeanne. Lougheed believed that having his wife present would encourage foreign dignitaries to include their spouses, thereby altering the visit&#x27;s atmosphere. Lougheed&#x27;s official visits included Japan in 1972, Europe in 1975, the United States in 1976, and China and Japan in 1983. Additionally, in 1977, Lougheed embarked on an ambitious official visit to the Middle East, Soviet Union and Switzerland. During this trip, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin made a public acknowledgment of Lougheed&#x27;s contribution to Canadian public life.

===Environment policy===
Lougheed&#x27;s tenure as Premier saw major environmental changes in the province. The government evaluated a number of ways to improve environmental and recreational access for Albertans. In 1975 Fish Creek Park was created in Calgary, purchasing land from Lougheed&#x27;s former boss Frederick Charles Mannix, and later in 1977 Lougheed&#x27;s government created Kananaskis Provincial Park, which would eventually be renamed Peter Lougheed Provincial Park. Lougheed credited Calgary architect Bill Milne and Highways and Transport Minister Clarence Copithorne with the idea for the new provincial park. Other efforts were taken to create urban parks in Edmonton, Grande Prairie, and Medicine Hat funded through the Heritage Savings Trust Fund.

===Economic development===

Peter Lougheed aimed to leverage the province&#x27;s natural resource revenues to stimulate economic development and diversification in Alberta.
In 1974, the Lougheed government purchased Pacific Western Airlines in part to assure the development of the North and Western Canada, and position Alberta as the gateway to the north. The province purchased the airline for $37.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) during a secret takeover bid. The Alberta government moved quickly out of worries British Columbia NDP Premier Dave Barrett had a similar plan to purchase the airline. The decision was highly controversial in Alberta and drew criticism from the business community and fiscal conservatives in the Progressive Conservative caucus. Following the acquisition, the headquarters for the airline was moved to Calgary, and Calgary International Airport became the new hub. In 1983, the Lougheed government sold the airline for $37.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ) following a campaign promising to do so during the 1982 Alberta general election.

Late in his Premiership Lougheed oversaw the early stages of the collapse of Principal Group, a consortium of Canadian financial companies headquartered in Edmonton. The operating licences for two of the Principal Group&#x27;s subsidiaries were cancelled by Alberta Treasurer Dick Johnston on June 30, 1987, and six weeks later the Principal Group declared bankruptcy owing more than 67,000 investors approximately $468 million (equivalent to $ million in ). While the collapse occurred under Don Getty&#x27;s premiership, Lougheed created a special cabinet task force that met weekly in 1985 to discuss the impending collapse, and financial regulators had pressed for action a year earlier. An inquiry found the Progressive Conservative government went to considerable lengths to prevent enforcement actions against certain companies to preserve public confidence. While Lougheed was not directly named, the inquiry found the actions by government ministers aligned with Lougheed&#x27;s &quot;province-building&quot; policy.

In 1984, his government published a White Paper on industrial and scientific strategy, which recognized that the oil-led boom had come to an end. The paper highlighted oil and gas as the primary &quot;engine of growth&quot; while also portraying financial institutions positively, despite the government&#x27;s knowledge of the dire financial situations of several Alberta-based businesses, including the Principal Group, Canadian Commercial Bank, and Northland Bank.

=== Culture ===
Lougheed inherited a province with a significant rural focus and a department of Culture that focused on pioneering agricultural events such as the &quot;Calgary Stampede&quot;, &quot;Klondike Days&quot;, and rural-based 4-H clubs. Future Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate George Bowering who attended the University of Alberta had described Alberta in the 1960s as &quot;a cultural desert&quot;. Under Lougheed&#x27;s leadership, Alberta transitioned from a restrictive, moralistic and rural-based province to a growingly urban and modern society.

In the leadup to the 1971 election, Lougheed committed his government to a &quot;mosaic&quot; approach to culture, which promoted different cultures and opportunities to expose Albertans to experiencing other cultures and traditions. After the election, Lougheed appointed Horst Schmid as Minister for Culture who began an aggressive campaign to promote the arts in Alberta. Strengthened by revenues from oil and gas development the government began a matching grant program for private donations to arts organizations, up to 25 per cent of an organization&#x27;s budget. The budget for the department of culture dramatically rose from $280,000 in 1971 to $7.5 million by 1979.

In 1974, the province created &quot;Heritage Day&quot; as a provincial holiday to celebrate cultural diversity, and Edmonton held its first Heritage Festival. Other festivals started during this time include Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 1980 and Edmonton Fringe Festival in 1982. Lougheed&#x27;s government also established a number of foundations including for art, literary arts, and performing arts. As part of Alberta&#x27;s 75th anniversary, the province sponsored &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, providing $3.4 million to develop the encyclopedia, and another $600,000 to provide a free copy to every school and library in Canada. Lougheed&#x27;s government strongly supported Edmonton&#x27;s bid for the 1978 Commonwealth Games, and Calgary&#x27;s bid for the 1988 Winter Olympic Games.

Fil Fraser attributes much of Lougheed&#x27;s support for the arts to his wife Jeanne who had studied voice, music and dance. Jeanne advocated on behalf of the arts as a way to &quot;nurture the spirit&quot; of Albertans. Fraser notes that the Lougheed&#x27;s advocated for the arts through being true patrons, constantly attending and participating in events across the province, both large and small. Jeanne held numerous board positions for Alberta cultural organizations including her &quot;baby&quot;, the Alberta Ballet Company.

===Relationship with federal Progressive Conservatives===
Lougheed transformed the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta from a marginal party into a dynasty that governed Alberta for over 40 years. Prior to his leadership, the party was unable to attract significant attention or high quality candidates, despite the success of the federal Progressive Conservatives in Alberta. Many of the active members and volunteers for the federal Progressive Conservatives were members and volunteers for the provincial Social Credit party. Lougheed was able to build a party from scratch bringing political and apolitical people under the Progressive Conservative tent that would not only bring himself into power, but result in greater support the federal party as well. Lougheed thought it was important that the public perceive the dominant figure in any provincial party be the leader, and not the leader of the federal equivalent.
Starting in 1965, future prime minister Joe Clark took a significant role in Lougheed&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives, moving from volunteer to paid full-time field worker assisting Lougheed in finding candidates for the 1967 election. Clark became a candidate himself in the 1967 election in Calgary South, losing a close election to Arthur J. Dixon. Robert Dinkel served as a campaign manager for the 1967 Progressive Conservatives, and later served as the Alberta manager for Joe Clark&#x27;s successful 1979 federal bid.

Later during his Premiership, Lougheed was viewed as a potential leader for the federal Progressive Conservatives. Biographer David Wood describes several instances where federal organizers attempted to woo Lougheed into leading the party. Wood describes a meeting in Halifax in 1975 where Lougheed attended the Nova Scotia provincial Progressive Conservative meeting which occurred simultaneously with a federal meeting. Federal leader Robert Stanfield allegedly asked if Lougheed was interested in taking over the leadership from him, and later &quot;twenty or more&quot; federal party members visited his hotel room urging Lougheed to run. Later Hal Jackman and other Ontario Conservatives led a movement to gain support in Ontario for a Lougheed federal run, going so far as to send a five-foot Christmas card with 800 signatures on it and holding rallies in support. Despite his efforts, Lougheed rejected the repeated offers from Jackman. Lougheed described his reason for not making the move federally in 1976 as a responsibility to Albertans after the recent election win in 1975, although Lougheed did remark &quot;the timing wasn&#x27;t right. It might have been right in 1977 or 1978&quot;.

Lougheed was also rumored to make the move to the federal party in the 1983 Progressive Conservative leadership election, with growing party and media attention on his potential bid. Lougheed&#x27;s wife Jeanne and son Joe urged Lougheed to make the jump to federal politics. However, Lougheed once again declined to make the jump to federal politics, admitting his age (54), inability to speak French fluently, and that he did not have the energy to campaign and learn French at the same time. To put the issue to rest, Lougheed returned to Edmonton early from a vacation in Hawaii and held a news conference to take himself out of the race. While Lougheed did not see an inability to speak French as a significant issue for a federal leadership candidate in the mid-1970s, he acknowledged the growing Quebec nationalist movement had made fluency a prerequisite for any federal leadership candidate. Ontario Premier Bill Davis sought the federal Progressive Conservative leadership in 1983, and asked for Lougheed&#x27;s endorsement. Lougheed emphatically declined, owing to Davis&#x27; refusal to join other Premiers in 1981 on a united energy policy for Canada. Furthermore, Lougheed could not support Joe Clark in retaining his position, and while Lougheed pledged to remain neutral, he did encourage Albertans to &quot;take a good look&quot; at the eventual winner Brian Mulroney for leader.

==Later life==
Lougheed officially resigned his seat in the Alberta Legislature on February 27, 1986, and returned to private life at the age of 57. After his retirement from politics, Lougheed remained active in government, legal and business affairs, joining Calgary-based law firm Bennett Jones as a partner in 1985, sitting on the Canadian Alliance for Trade and Job Opportunities to promote the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in 1987 and serving as the co-chair of the Canada-Japan Forum in 1991. Lougheed served as an honorary chair of the Calgary Olympic Winter Games Organizing Committee.

Lougheed was named to the board of directors of a number of Canadian businesses, and at one time held a seat on 17 different boards. These corporations included ATCO, Royal Bank of Canada, Princeton Developments, Nortel, CFCN Communications, Bombardier, Canadian Pacific Railway, Keyera, Carlson Construction and a number of other businesses. Lougheed continued to support the development of Alberta&#x27;s natural gas industry, becoming the chair of the Alberta Northeast Gas project which promoted the construction of the Iroquois Pipeline. Lougheed was named a member of the Trilateral Commission.

In 1996 Lougheed was appointed Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University, succeeding Agnes Benidickson, a title he held until 2002. Lougheed made the decision on the advice of his two sons who attended Queen&#x27;s. In 2002 Lougheed was appointed to the inaugural board of directors for the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation.

=== Political involvement ===

Lougheed rarely commented on Alberta&#x27;s public policy or the Progressive Conservative Party following his resignation as Premier. Lougheed did not endorse any candidate as his successor, nor did he endorse a candidate in the 1992 Progressive Conservative leadership race. In 2006, Lougheed&#x27;s position changed after the resignation of Premier Ralph Klein, and he began to make occasional political statements and take interviews where he discussed public policy. Late in the 2006 Progressive Conservative leadership election, Lougheed endorsed the eventual runner-up Jim Dinning and in the 2011 leadership race, Lougheed&#x27;s endorsement of Alison Redford was seen by observers as a difference-maker for her successful campaign.

Lougheed did make occasional statements in support or opposition of successor Progressive Conservative premiers. In a 1995 interview, Lougheed was critical of Conservative government cuts to social services following the early 1990s recession, both targeting Ontario Premier Mike Harris and Alberta Premier Ralph Klein. In June 2006 interview with &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; reporter Gordon Jaremko, Lougheed criticized Alberta&#x27;s royalty structure and called for a review of non-renewable resource royalties, which had been significantly reduced by the Klein government in the 1990s to spur development. The interview came months after Klein announced his retirement and created a significant policy issue in the 2006 Progressive Conservative leadership race. Shortly after winning the Progressive Conservative leadership, Premier Ed Stelmach called for the Alberta Royalty Review.

Lougheed was a staunch supporter of the Charlottetown Accord and saw it as an opportunity for Quebec to sign onto the Constitution as a full partner. In a 1992 essay for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Lougheed supported a number of concessions for Quebec, including an elected Senate with equal representation from each province, agreed it was fair for Quebec to guarantee 25 per cent representation in the House of Commons, agreed to require a majority of Quebec Senators approve legislation affecting French language or culture, and three members of the Supreme Court of Canada from Quebec and trained in Quebec&#x27;s civil code. While Lougheed did not support additional engrained rights for Indigenous persons, claiming that it would create a new order of government, he accepted the consensus to include the provisions in the Charlottetown Accord. Lougheed also advocated for a &quot;citizen assembly&quot; composed of elected representatives from each province to negotiate Constitutional reforms as a fallback measure if the Charlottetown Accord failed. Under his plan, no current members of federal or provincial legislatures would have been eligible to participate, and members of the citizen assembly would be barred from running for a seat in a federal or provincial legislatures for six years.

=== Illness and death ===
Lougheed had long been suffering from a heart condition and high blood pressure which required a triple bypass surgery in 1995. In 2012, his health severely deteriorated and he was taken to the hospital named after him in Calgary where he died of natural causes at age 84 on September 13. His body lay in state from September 17 to 18 inside the main rotunda of the Alberta Legislature Building. The national and provincial flags were flown at half-mast throughout the province. After lying in state, Lougheed&#x27;s body travelled back to Calgary in a motorcade from Edmonton that followed a procession through the city, passing places of significance to Lougheed. A state memorial was held on September 21, 2012, at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium in Calgary.

In response to his death, Prime Minister Stephen Harper described Lougheed as &quot;one of the most remarkable Canadians of his generation.&quot; Alberta Premier Alison Redford cut short her trip to Asia in order to attend his funeral. Alberta&#x27;s opposition leader Danielle Smith, former prime minister Jean Chrétien (who was the Minister of Justice during negotiations to patriate the Canadian constitution), federal opposition leader Thomas Mulcair and Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi issued statements condoling his death. Former prime minister Joe Clark wrote a special commentary in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; praising Lougheed.

==Legacy==

Jeanne and Peter Lougheed were often compared to Jackie and John F. Kennedy as well as Margaret and Pierre Trudeau. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; alluded to the &quot;movie star&quot; treatment the Lougheeds were greeted with across the province. Fil Fraser described Lougheed&#x27;s time as Premier were the &quot;Camelot for arts in Alberta&quot;.

As a politician, Lougheed traveled Alberta to meet voters in their communities and impressed upon Progressive Conservative candidates the importance of door-to-door politics. When selecting candidates he looked for community leaders and ethnic diversity to ensure the Progressive Conservative Party reflected Alberta&#x27;s increasing diversity. He lamented &quot;professional politicians&quot; and sought candidates with professional experience in multiple industries. Lougheed understood the power of television, and was one of the first major Canadian politicians to build an electoral and government strategy around it. He advocated for a decentralization of the Government of Alberta, moving offices outside of Edmonton and Calgary to newly constructed provincial buildings in rural parts of the province.

During his 14 years as Premier, Lougheed oversaw significant economy and cultural growth in Alberta, largely fueled by oil and gas royalty revenues. Lougheed&#x27;s domestic policies saw the development of the Athabasca oil sands and the creation of the state-owned Alberta Energy Company to facilitate development of the oil and gas industry. Despite his party&#x27;s Conservative label, Lougheed consistently made policies and investments that significantly expanded the government&#x27;s role in the economy, impacted industries across the province, both in oil and gas and other areas of the free market, such as the purchase of Pacific Western Airlines. Lougheed implemented large-scale increases in provincial royalty rates for oil and gas production, and during the National Energy Program he reduced oil and gas production and paused two oil sands projects. These policies were unpopular with the Alberta oil and gas industry and conservatives in Alberta. The close ties of the state-owned Alberta Energy Company to the government gave critics the impression of an &quot;unfair competitive advantage&quot;, and Lougheed&#x27;s intervention in the free market through controlling oil and gas production worried his conservative base.

From an investment standpoint, Lougheed did not believe in corporate welfare, and instead sought equity stakes in businesses the province supported resulting in large holdings. In 1976, Lougheed created the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund as a &quot;rainy day&quot; fund for oil and gas royalties. He also placed a significant emphasis on diversification of the Alberta economy away from oil and gas revenues. However, under Lougheed the government of Alberta continued to fund a significant portion of the provincial budget from non-renewable resource revenue, growing from 35 per cent of revenue in 1973 to 51 per cent in 1979.

His advocacy extended beyond provincial borders and was a driving force for Canadian premiers during the constitutional repatriation debates of the late-1970s and early-1980s. He is credited for the amending formula and introduction of the &quot;notwithstanding clause&quot; in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. However, former University of Calgary professor Roger Gibbins notes that Alberta remained in a defensive position during constitutional debates due to the National Energy Program and Trudeau&#x27;s willingness to independently repatriate the constitution, in that sense Gibbins viewed Lougheed&#x27;s contribution to constitutional debates as maintaining the status quo, which was not in the best interest of Western Canada.

Former prime minister Brian Mulroney described Lougheed as a &quot;great leader for Alberta...and for the entire nation&quot;. Biographer Alan Tupper described Lougheed as exemplifying Alberta&#x27;s best qualities, and as the &quot;principal architect of modern Alberta&quot;. Former prime minister and justice minister during the constitutional debates Jean Chrétien described Lougheed as &quot;he was tough, but he was a gentleman&quot;. Former Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi described Lougheed&#x27;s legacy as &quot;I have never known an Alberta or a Canadian that did not benefit from his legacy. We owe him so much: our strong industries, our magnetic cities, our sense of identity within Canada&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Policy Options&quot; a magazine published by the public policy think tank Institute for Research on Public Policy brought together a jury of 30 prominent Canadians which named Peter Lougheed the best Canadian Premier in the past 40 years (1972–2012). Lougheed was ranked first amongst 21 of the 30 jurors.

==Honours==
In 1971 Lougheed was named honorary chief &quot;Thunderbird&quot; by the Cree Nation, and later was named honorary chief &quot;Crop Eared Wolf&quot; by the Blood Nation.

Lougheed was styled &quot;The Honourable&quot; for the duration of his membership in the Executive Council of Alberta from 1971 to 1986. When he was appointed a privy councillor (postnominal: &quot;PC&quot;) on April 17, 1982, the style &quot;The Honourable&quot; was extended for life. In 1986, he was named a Companion of the Order of Canada (postnominal: &quot;CC&quot;), and in 1989 he was named to the Alberta Order of Excellence (postnominal: &quot;AOE&quot;).

In 1986 the University of Alberta established the Peter Lougheed Scholarship, and later established other scholarships in health sciences, law and arts in his name. In 2001 he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame which established the Peter Lougheed/CIHR Scholarship. Harvard University awarded Lougheed the university&#x27;s Distinguished Alumni Award in 1986.

The Kananaskis Provincial Park was renamed Peter Lougheed Provincial Park in 1986 after Lougheed&#x27;s retirement as Premier. The new Calgary General Hospital constructed in 1988 was named the Peter Lougheed Centre, Lougheed received his end-of-life care and died in the hospital. Other sites named in honour of Lougheed include Edmonton&#x27;s Peter Lougheed Multicultural Village, the Jeanne and Peter Lougheed Building at Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, a residence hall at the University of Alberta, and Lougheed Avenue in Heisler, Alberta. After his death proposals were made to rename Calgary International Airport in his honour.

<text>Niatross (1977–1999) was an American champion standardbred race horse that many believe was the greatest harness horse of all time.

==Background==
The son of Albatross out of the mare Niagara Dream, Niatross was foaled on March 30, 1977. He was trained and driven by co-owner Clint Galbraith.

==Racing career==
In September 1979, after Niatross won his first six races, a half interest in him was sold to Stockbroker Lou Guida and the Niatross syndicate for $2.5 million. He was unbeaten in 13 starts in his 2-year-old season, when he was named Harness Horse of the Year. His earnings of $604,900 were a two-year-old record for either the Standardbred or Thoroughbred breed.

In 1980, Niatross won The Meadowlands Pace, which was the first million dollar race in either standardbred or thoroughbred racing history.
He also won the Triple Crown. In a time trial at The Red Mile in Lexington, Kentucky he beat the world record by three seconds, setting a mark of 1:49.1. In addition to his time trial he paced the fastest race miles on one mile (1.52.1) and half mile (1.54.4) tracks. The 1980 season brought Niatross 24 wins from 26 starts.

Early in the 1980 season Niatross won the Cane Pace before racing at the Saratoga Standardbred track in Saratoga, NY, where he spooked and fell over the inside hubrail and was defeated for the first time. 
In an elimination for the Meadowlands Pace, he broke stride, lost valuable ground, regained his gait and, in what Stanley Dancer described as the greatest performance he had seen, recovered and finished 4th, qualifying for the final. In the Meadowlands Pace final, Niatross went right to the front and never looked back, winning by 4 1/2 lengths from Storm Damage in 1.53.1 as the 2-5 favourite. He set a world record for his age and was only 1/5 of a second outside of the overall world record. Trainer Clint Galbraith described the race as being more important than any race in Niatross&#x27; career.
Niatross went on to beat all of his competition easily in future starts, frequently setting track records, including a new race, track and Canadian record during the prestigious Prix d&#x27;Été at Blue Bonnets racetrack in Montreal, Quebec. He also won the Gaines Memorial at Vernon Downs, the Oliver Wendell Holmes Pace at the Meadowlands, the Dancer Memorial at Freehold and the American Classic at Hollywood Park. In the Little Brown Jug Niatross recorded wins in straight heats of 1.55 and 1.54.4 setting six world records before a record Jug crowd of 45,621. He then won the Messenger Stakes to complete the Triple Crown. A December appearance at Pompano Park, his last career race, brought a crowd of more than 23,000.

==Time Trial==
Until 1980 the fastest mile recorded in harness racing was 1.52.0 by Steady Star. On October 1, 1980 Niatross time trialled at The Red Mile in Lexington, Kentucky with a previous best of 1.52.4 recorded at Syracuse earlier in the year. At The Red Mile Niatross reached the quarter mile in 27.3 almost one second faster than Steady Star&#x27;s record and the half mile in 54.3 equal with Steady Star. Reaching the three quarter mile in 1.21.4, a 27.2 last quarter resulted in a mile of 1.49.1, the fastest ever by 2 4/5 seconds.

==Stud career==
By the time Niatross retired to stud at Castleton Farm, Kentucky, in 1981, he had earned more prize money than any other standardbred horse in history. He had been named Harness Horse of the Year in 1979 and 1980, the New York Post Athlete of the Year in 1980, and Harness Horse of the Decade for the 1980s. At stud, he commanded a top price for his services. Among his progeny were winners of the Little Brown Jug. One son, Nihilator, won Horse of the Year honors and his first two crops earned $8.6 million. Niatross was relocated to Pine Hollow Farm in New York in 1983 and to Saratoga Standardbred Farm in 1986 however he was not as successful in New York as he had been in Kentucky.

In 1996, when he was 19 years old, Niatross made a 20-city tour for his fans in Canada and the United States. In 1997, he was inducted as a member of the Living Horse Hall of Fame. In May 1999, he took ill and was transported to the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s New Bolton Center where he was diagnosed with a large cancerous mass in his abdomen. On June 7, 1999, Niatross was humanely euthanized. He was cremated with his remains interred at the Hall Of Fame Museum in Goshen, New York.

<doc id="226085" wikidata="Q336444" url="?curid=226085" title="Conrad Black">
<text>Conrad Moffat Black, Baron Black of Crossharbour (born 25 August 1944), is a Canadian-British writer and former politician, newspaper publisher, and financier.

Black&#x27;s father was businessman George Montegu Black II, who had significant holdings in Canadian manufacturing, retail and media businesses through part-ownership of the holding company Ravelston Corporation. In 1978, two years after their father&#x27;s death, Conrad and his older brother Montegu took majority control of Ravelston. Over the next seven years, Conrad Black sold off most of their non-media holdings to focus on newspaper publishing. He controlled Hollinger International, once the world&#x27;s third-largest English-language newspaper empire, which published &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (UK), &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; (US), &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; (Israel), &quot;National Post&quot; (Canada), and hundreds of community newspapers in North America, before controversy erupted over the sale of some of the company&#x27;s assets.

Black was granted a life peerage in 2001 and gave up his Canadian citizenship to accept the title in light of the Nickle Resolution, which bans British honours for Canadian citizens. He regained his Canadian citizenship in 2023.

In 2007, Black was convicted on four counts of fraud in a United States district court in Chicago. While two of the criminal fraud charges were overturned on appeal, a conviction for felony fraud and obstruction of justice was upheld in 2010 and he was re-sentenced to 42 months in prison and a fine of $125,000. In 2019, President Donald Trump granted him a federal pardon.

Black is a longtime columnist and author, and has written a column for the &quot;National Post&quot; since he founded it in 1998. He has written eleven books, mostly in the fields of Canadian and American history, including biographies of Quebec premier Maurice Duplessis and US presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon and Donald Trump, as well as two memoirs. He has also hosted two interview shows on the Canadian cable network VisionTV. A political conservative, he belonged to the UK&#x27;s Conservative Party, but also has some idiosyncratic views, including his support for Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal.

==Early life and family==
Black was born in Montreal, Quebec, to a family originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba. His father, George Montegu Black Jr., a chartered accountant, was the president of Canadian Breweries Limited, a brewing conglomerate that had earlier absorbed Winnipeg Breweries, which he had inherited from his father George Montegu Black Sr. Conrad Black&#x27;s mother was the former Jean Elizabeth Riley, a daughter of Conrad Stephenson Riley, whose father founded The Great-West Life Assurance Company, and a great-granddaughter of an early co-owner of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. His father was a shareholder in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

Biographer George Tombs said of Black&#x27;s motivations: &quot;He was born into a very large family of athletic, handsome people. He wasn&#x27;t particularly athletic or handsome like they were, so he developed a different skill — wordplay, which he practised a lot with his father.&quot; Black has written that his father was &quot;cultured [and] humorous&quot; and that his mother was a &quot;natural, convivial, and altogether virtuous person&quot;. Of his older brother George Montegu Black III (Monte), Black has written that he was &quot;one of the greatest natural athletes I have known&quot;, and that though &quot;generally more sociable than I was, he was never a cad or even inconstant, or ever an ungenerous friend or less than a gentleman&quot;. The Black family maintains a family plot at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto where Black&#x27;s parents and brother are buried along with his good friend and his wife&#x27;s former husband, journalist, poet and broadcaster, George Jonas.

===Education===
Black was sent by his father to a prestigious preparatory school, Upper Canada College (UCC), where he was first educated. Black, confided to his fellow student John Fraser, a future renowned foreign correspondent for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and later the editor of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, that the place felt like a concentration camp, but most of the students were oblivious to the harsh reality. During this time, at the age of eight, he invested his life savings of $60 in one share of General Motors. Six years later, he was expelled from UCC for selling stolen exam papers. He then attended Trinity College School in Port Hope, where he lasted less than a year, being expelled for insubordinate behaviour. Successfully completing the year as an extramural student, Black transferred to Thornton Hall, a private school in Toronto.

Black continued his post-secondary education at Carleton University. He attended Toronto&#x27;s Osgoode Hall Law School of York University, but his studies ended after he failed his first year exams. In 1970, he completed a law degree at Université Laval, and in 1973 completed a Master of Arts degree in history at McGill University.

Black&#x27;s thesis at McGill would become the first half of his first book on Quebec premier Maurice Duplessis. Black had been granted access to Duplessis&#x27; papers, housed in Duplessis&#x27; former residence in Trois-Rivières, which included &quot;figures from the famous Union Nationale &quot;caisse électorale&quot; (the party war chest), a copy of the Leader of the Opposition&#x27;s tax returns, [and] gossip from bishops&quot;, as well as
Black subsequently had the principal items from the papers copied and microfilmed, and he donated copies to McGill, York, and Windsor universities.

===Marriages===
Black&#x27;s first marriage was in 1978 to Joanna Hishon of Montreal, who worked as a secretary in his and his brother Montegu&#x27;s brokerage office. The couple had two sons and a daughter. They separated in 1991. Their divorce was finalized in 1992; that same year Black married British-born Jewish-Canadian journalist Barbara Amiel. Black described Amiel, in the first volume of his autobiography as &quot;beautiful, brilliant, ideologically a robust spirit&quot; and &quot;chic, humorous and preternaturally sexy&quot;. Courtroom evidence revealed that the couple exchanged over 11,000 emails.

===Religion===
&quot;My family&quot;, Black wrote in 2009, &quot;was divided between atheism and agnosticism, and I followed rather unthinkingly and inactively in those paths into my twenties.&quot; By his early thirties he &quot;no longer had any confidence in the non-existence of God&quot;. Thereafter, he &quot;approached Rome at a snail&#x27;s pace&quot;, and began to study the writings of Roman Catholic thinkers such as St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Cardinal Newman, and Jacques Maritain. Having accepted the possibility of miracles and thus of the Resurrection of Christ, Black was received into the Roman Catholic Church on 18 June 1986 by Gerald Emmett Cardinal Carter, Archbishop of Toronto, at the cardinal&#x27;s official residence. He had a dispensation to receive the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church, from Cardinals Léger and Carter, starting in 1974.

Black developed a close friendship with Cardinal Carter and relied on him as a spiritual advisor. On Carter&#x27;s death, Black wrote:
In 2001, Black was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, a Papal order of chivalry awarded by Pope John Paul II and delivered by Cardinals Carter and Aloysius Ambrozic. He has written that his faith helped him endure his imprisonment in the United States. Black is also a major shareholder in &quot;The Catholic Herald&quot;, and was the vice-president of Léger&#x27;s charity from 1972 to 1990.

==Career==
=== Early business ventures ===
Black became involved in a number of businesses, mainly publishing newspapers, starting when he was still in university. In 1966, Black bought his first newspaper, the &quot;Eastern Townships Advertiser&quot; in Quebec. Following the foundation as an investment vehicle of the Ravelston Corporation by the Black family in 1969, Black, together with friends David Radler and Peter G. White, purchased and operated the &quot;Sherbrooke Record&quot;, the small English-language daily in Sherbrooke, Quebec. In 1971, the three formed Sterling Newspapers Limited, a holding company that acquired several other small Canadian regional daily and weekly newspapers, including the &quot;Prince Rupert Daily News&quot; and the Summerside, Prince Edward Island, &quot;Journal Pioneer&quot;.

===Corporate ownership through holding companies===
George Black died in June 1976, ten days after his wife, leaving Conrad Black and his older brother, Montegu, a 22.4% stake in Ravelston Corporation, which by then owned 61% voting control of Argus Corporation, an influential holding company in Canada. Argus controlled large stakes in five Canadian corporations: Hollinger Mines, Standard Broadcasting, Dominion Stores, Domtar and Massey Ferguson. Hollinger controlled Labrador Mining and Exploration and had a large stake in Noranda Mines. Black succeeded his father as a director of Dominion Stores and Standard Broadcasting, owner of radio stations CFRB (Toronto) and CJAD (Montreal), and television station CJOH (Ottawa). Conrad Black became a director of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in 1977.

Through his father&#x27;s position at Canadian Breweries, and his status as a co-founder of Ravelston, Black gained early association with two of Canada&#x27;s most prominent businessmen: John A. &quot;Bud&quot; McDougald and E. P. Taylor, the first two presidents of Argus. Following McDougald&#x27;s death in 1978, Black paid $18 million to McDougald&#x27;s widow and her sister for control of Ravelston and thereby, control of Toronto-based Argus. Interviews with the two sisters in their retirement homes in Florida were aired 21 September 1980 in the episode of the CBC&#x27;s &quot;The Canadian Establishment&quot;, entitled &quot;Ten Toronto Street&quot;. This episode covered the period during which Conrad Black became president of Argus Corporation following the death of McDougald. Black&#x27;s new associate, Nelson M. Davis became chairman. Patrick Watson, the host and narrator of series interviewed the two widows in their Florida retirement homes. Black recorded that the widows &quot;understood and approved every letter of every word of the agreement&quot;. Other observers admired Black for marshaling enough investor support to win control without committing a large block of personal assets. He brought in new partners to replace Mrs. McDougal and her sister Mrs. W. Eric Philips.

Some of the Argus assets were already troubled, and others did not fit Black&#x27;s long-term vision. Black resigned as Chairman of Massey Ferguson company on 23 May 1980, after which Argus donated its shares to the employees&#x27; pension funds, both salaried and union. Hollinger Mines was then turned into a holding company that initially focused on resource-based businesses.

In 1981 Norcen Energy, one of his companies, acquired a minority position in Ohio-based Hanna Mining Co. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a disclosure was made to the effect that Norcen took &quot;an investment position&quot; in Hanna. The filing did not include a disclosure that Norcen&#x27;s board planned to seek majority control. Black subsequently was charged by the SEC with filing misleading public statements. These charges were later withdrawn.

===Dominion pension dispute===
In 1984, the Dominion Stores Board of which Montegu Black was the chairman, upon the direction of Conrad Black who controlled Dominion through Hollinger, withdrew $62 million from the Dominion workers&#x27; pension plan surplus for himself and his shareholders. The company said it considered the surplus the rightful property of the employer (Dominion Stores Ltd.). The Dominion employees&#x27; union the United Food and Commercial Workers went to court to block the withdrawal. At the time, Dominion was in financial trouble, with stores being sold off, employees laid off, and it was losing money yearly. According to the Supreme Court of Ontario, &quot;Dominion&#x27;s managers saw the pension funds as a source of succour.&quot;. Conrad Black said he was &quot;not running a welfare agency for corrupt union leaders and a slovenly work force.&quot; The Supreme Court of Ontario ruled against the company, and ordered them to return $38 million to the pension fund.

===Industrial holdings shifted to publishing===
Over time, Black focused the formerly diverse activities of his companies on newspaper publishing. Argus Corporation was one of Canada&#x27;s most important conglomerates, though apart from Standard Broadcasting, it had less than 25% of the stock of the companies in which it was invested, and four-fifths of its own stock did not vote. Black had negotiated the acquisition of that stock from Power Corporation chairman Paul G. Desmarais in 1979 to become, as he put it, a &#x27;real proprietor&#x27;. Black supervised the divesting of interests in manufacturing, retailing, broadcasting and ultimately oil, gas and mining. Canadian writer John Ralston Saul argued in 2008, &quot;Lord Black was never a real &#x27;capitalist&#x27; because he never created wealth, only dismantled wealth. His career has been largely about stripping corporations. Destroying them.&quot; Journalist and writer George Jonas, the former husband of Black&#x27;s wife, Barbara Amiel, contended that Hollinger made its &quot;investors ... billions [of dollars]&quot;.

Black bought Quebec City&#x27;s &quot;Le Soleil&quot;, &quot;Le Droit&quot; of Ottawa, and &quot;Le Quotidien&quot; of Chicoutimi from Jacques G. Francoeur.

===Growth and divestment of press holdings===
In 1986, Andrew Knight, then editor of &quot;The Economist&quot;, advised Black an investment could be made in the ailing Telegraph Group (London, U.K.), and Black was able to gain control of the Group for £30 million. By this investment, Black made his first entry into British press ownership. Five years later, he bought &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, and by 1990, his companies ran over 400 newspaper titles in North America, the majority of them small community papers. For a time from this date he headed the third-largest newspaper group in the Western World. In 1991, the Telegraph Group acquired a 25 percent stake in John Fairfax Holdings, an Australian media company which published the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Australian Financial Review&quot;. Foreign-ownership laws prevented Black from acquiring a majority stake, but he had effective control of the company. He sold his share to a New Zealand investment firm in 1996 for $513 million, a reported $300 million profit. He subsequently complained about Australia&#x27;s &quot;capricious and politicized foreign ownership rules&quot;.

Hollinger had bought a 23% stake in the Southam newspaper chain in 1992 from TORSTAR, publisher of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. Black and Radler acquired the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; in 1994. Hollinger International shares were listed on New York Stock Exchange in 1996, at which time the company boosted its stake in Southam to a control position. Becoming a public company trading in the US has been called &quot;a fateful move, exposing Black&#x27;s empire to America&#x27;s more rigorous regulatory regime and its more aggressive institutional shareholders&quot;.

Hollinger acquired the Calgary Herald as part of the Southam Inc. purchase in 1996. Cuts and downsizing followed, as well as “editorial directions … to slant the news”. In response, Calgary Herald newsroom staff unionized in 1998, and in 1999–2000, went on strike. In one interaction with a strike leader, Black characterized his own approach to the labour dispute as “amputating gangrenous limbs.”

Under Black, Hollinger launched the &quot;National Post&quot; in Toronto in 1998. This newspaper was sold throughout the country in direct competition with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. From 1999 to 2000, Hollinger International sold several newspapers in five deals worth a total of CA$3 billion, a total that included millions of dollars in &quot;non-compete agreements&quot; for Hollinger insiders.

===Fate of Hollinger===
Institutional investor Tweedy, Browne opposed the payment of non-compete fees to Hollinger management in connection with the sales and requested on the day before the annual meeting in May 2003 that a special committee be appointed to look into the compensation of management. Black agreed to the demand but citing such fees was standard procedure in the newspaper industry and had been requested by buyers and had been properly disclosed. The special committee and its counsel, former chairman of the SEC Richard C. Breeden, discovered that David Radler had misled the Hollinger directors, including Black, about the extent of his own participation in some of the related party transactions to sell otherwise unclaimed community newspapers in the US and also that two of the smaller transactions involving non-compete payments had not been signed by the vendors. Breeden involved the US Attorney in Chicago, and Radler, after about 18 months, would promise to plead guilty to one count of fraud and to provide evidence against Black and others in exchange for a light sentence in Canada.

Black made an agreement with Breeden, shortly after the unsigned status of the two non-compete agreements came to light, by which he would remain as chairman, but temporarily vacate the position of chief executive, pending verification that he, Black, had known nothing of these problems, which were handled by the company&#x27;s counsel, and occurred in Radler&#x27;s American Publishing division. Black and Breeden were in negotiations, sponsored by Henry A. Kissinger, who was a director of Hollinger, when the special committee, without warning, sued Black and others. Black counter-sued, and included a libel suit in Canada.

The Hollinger group of companies was effectively dismantled as a result of the cascade of criminal and civil lawsuits that followed in relation to sales of papers and intellectual property to third parties, most alleging misrepresentation and some alleging false or deliberately misleading accounts having been presented. The costs incurred by Hollinger International through the investigation of Black and his associates climbed to US$200 million. Black claims a significant portion of the sums paid by Hollinger International went to Richard C. Breeden. Black himself incurred large legal fees.

Black resigned from the board of Hollinger in 2005, and many of Hollinger International&#x27;s assets ended up being sold at prices significantly lower than those contemplated in uncompleted negotiations while Black was with the company. Shortly afterward, a number of court and regulatory orders left the company with no income or operating business.

On August 2, 2007, Hollinger filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the United States. At the time, the company was 78% owned by Black&#x27;s company Ravelston. Hollinger continued to assert control over Sun-Media Times Group Inc. Hollinger shares were delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in August 2008.

===Media host and commentator===
Black co-hosted a weekly talk show, &quot;The Zoomer&quot;, which premiered 7 October 2013 on VisionTV in Canada, and ran for two years. He interviewed Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, and Justin Trudeau who went on respectively to be President of the United States, British prime minister, and Prime Minister of Canada; and also interviewed Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party. From January 2015 through 2016, Black hosted &quot;Conversations with Conrad&quot;, a series on VisionTV in which Black conducted long-form one-on-one interviews with notable figures such as Margaret Atwood, Brian Mulroney, Rick Mercer, Barry Humphries and Michael Coren.

As of June 2020, Black is a commentator on two weekly national radio segments in the United States, and writes columns on online sites including &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;RealClearPolitics&quot;, &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, and &quot;American Greatness&quot; in addition to his weekly column in the &quot;National Post&quot;.

==Lifestyle==
Born to a wealthy family, Black inherited the family home and of land in Toronto&#x27;s exclusive Bridle Path neighbourhood after his parents&#x27; deaths in 1976. Black and first wife Joanna Hishon maintained homes in Palm Beach, Toronto and London. After he married Barbara Amiel, he acquired a luxury Park Avenue apartment in New York. When the latter was sold in 2005, the US Department of Justice seized net proceeds of $8.5 million, pending resolution of court actions. His London townhouse in Kensington sold in 2005 for about US$25 million. His Palm Beach mansion was listed for sale in 2004 at $36 million. In late April 2011, this Florida property was also sold by Black for about US$30 million. The Black family estate was sold in March 2016, for a reported price of CA$16.5 million, but on a sale-lease-back of up to nine years, with an option to buy back, and the Blacks continue to live there. Black has disclosed his intention to remain and perhaps reacquire. He has returned to the UK part-time.

According to biographer Tom Bower, &quot;They flaunted their wealth.&quot; Black&#x27;s critics suggested that it was Black&#x27;s second wife, Amiel, who pushed him towards a life of opulence. Black has always denied that he spent more than his income and position justified. He has called claims that his wife charged personal expenses to a corporate account, including US$2,463 (£1,272) for handbags, $2,785 for opera tickets, and $140 for Amiel&#x27;s &quot;jogging attire&quot; fiction and has pointed out that they were never alleged at trial.

Black was ranked 238th wealthiest in Britain by the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; (2003), with an estimated wealth of £136m. Having departed the country, he was dropped from the 2004 list.

Black is a former Steering Committee member of the Bilderberg Group.

==Fraud conviction==
Black was convicted on three counts of fraud and one count of obstruction of justice in US District Court in Chicago on 13 July 2007. He was sentenced to serve 6½ years in federal prison and to pay Hollinger $6.1 million, in addition to a fine of US$125,000. Appeals resulted in two of Black&#x27;s three criminal fraud charges being vacated, and his conviction for obstruction of justice was upheld. Black was initially found guilty of diverting funds for personal benefit from money due to Hollinger International, and of other irregularities. The embezzlement occurred when the company sold certain publishing assets. He was also found guilty of one charge of obstruction of justice.

In the initial verdict, Black was fined $125,000 and sentenced to 6½ years in prison, serving a total of 37 months after two fraud charges were overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, leaving one fraud charge and one obstruction of justice charge, and the improper receipt of $285,000, which was disclosed and approved but incompletely documented, and civil penalties from the SEC. The 6½ year sentence was reduced to 3½ years. The $6.1 million fine to the SEC was reduced to $4.1 million in 2013.

===Supreme Court review===

The Supreme Court of the United States heard an appeal of his case on 8 December 2009 and rendered a decision in June 2010. Black&#x27;s application for bail was rejected by both the Supreme Court and the US District Court judge who sentenced him.

On 24 June 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled 8–0 with one recusal, instructing the 7th Circuit to review all four of Black&#x27;s convictions including the obstruction of justice charge, finding that the definition of honest services fraud used in Judge St. Eve&#x27;s (the trial judge) charge to the jury in Black&#x27;s case was too broad, &quot;unconstitutionally vague&quot;, ruling the law could apply only to cases where bribes and kickbacks had changed hands and ordered the US 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago to review three fraud convictions against Black in light of the Supreme Court&#x27;s new definition. The Court reviewed Black&#x27;s case and determined whether his fraud convictions stood or if there should be a new trial. The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the jailed former media baron&#x27;s obstruction-of-justice conviction, for which he was serving a concurrent 6½-year sentence.

===Later developments===
Black&#x27;s lawyers filed an application for bail pending the appeals court&#x27;s review. Prosecutors contested Black&#x27;s bail request, saying in court papers that Black&#x27;s trial jury had proof that Black committed fraud. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals granted bail on 19 July 2010 under which Black was released pending retrial on a $2 million unsecured bond put up by conservative philanthropist Roger Hertog and ordered to remain on bail in the continental United States until at least 16 August, when his bail hearing was to resume, and the date by which Black and the prosecution were ordered by the Court of Appeals to submit written arguments for that court&#x27;s review of his case. Black&#x27;s bail, initially, pending trial, had been $38 million.

Black was to appear once again in a Chicago court on 16 August to provide full and detailed financial information to the judge, who would then consider his request to be allowed to return to Canada while on bail.

Black&#x27;s legal representatives, led by Miguel Estrada, advised the court they would not provide the requisite accounting and would thus not be interested in petitioning the court further on the matter. Black was under no compulsion to make this disclosure as he had initiated the appeal for a bail variation of his own volition. His next court appearance, where he might reapply for permission to return to Canada, was set for 20 September 2010.

On 28 October 2010, the US 7th Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed the dismissal of two of the three vacated fraud accounts and retained one and the obstruction count. The court ruled that he must be re-sentenced.

On 17 December 2010, Black lost an appeal as to fact and law on his remaining convictions for fraud and obstruction of justice. The three judge panel did not explain its reasoning. On 31 May 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear an appeal from the circuit court&#x27;s decision, also without comment. The re-sentencing on the two remaining counts by the original trial judge occurred on 24 June 2011. Black&#x27;s lawyers recommended he be sentenced to the 29 months he had already served while the prosecution argued for Black to complete his original 6½ year sentence. The probation officer&#x27;s report recommended a sentence of between 33 and 41 months. At the hearing, Judge St. Eve re-sentenced Black to a reduced term of 42 months and a fine of $125,000, returning him to prison on 6 September 2011 to serve the remaining seven months of his sentence, allowing for a reduction for good conduct, for which the trial judge commended him.

On 30 June 2011, Black published an article for the &quot;National Review Online&quot; that provided his scathing view of the legal case, detailing it as a miscarriage of justice and an &quot;unaccountable and often lawless prosecution&quot;.

Black&#x27;s motion that the last remaining counts of conviction be vacated due to prosecutorial misconduct and his claim that he had been denied the right to have the defense counsel of his choice were denied in February 2013, along with his request for an evidentiary hearing. Black continues to maintain his innocence, and has likened the United States justice system to that of North Korea. Black has publicly stated that he is proud to have been &quot;sent to prison for crimes I would never dream of committing, for having fought it out as well as anyone could, and for making the best I could of a bad situation&quot;.

===Incarceration===
Until 21 July 2010, Black was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (Low Security) in Sumter County, Florida, a part of Federal Correctional Complex, Coleman.

Following his release, Black wrote a column for Canada&#x27;s &quot;National Post&quot; on his time in prison. He described US inmates as an &quot;ostracized, voiceless legion of the walking dead&quot;.

Black did not return to the Federal Correctional Institution in Coleman, Florida. On 6 September 2011, he was sent to a different Florida federal correction facility in Miami. He was released from prison on 4 May 2012. Although he became a citizen of the United Kingdom in 2001 and became a British peer, he chose to live in his native Canada after his prison term was completed. Black, who renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2001 as a result of &quot;Black v Chrétien&quot;, was granted a one-year temporary resident permit to live in Canada in March 2012 when he was still serving his sentence.

Upon his release from prison, Black was deported to Canada.

===Removal from the Order of Canada and Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada===
Black was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1990. In 2011, after Black returned to prison due to the failure of his appeal, Rideau Hall, the seat of the Chancellery of Honours, confirmed that the honour accorded to Black was under review by the order&#x27;s Advisory Council, which has the power to recommend &quot;the termination of a person&#x27;s appointment to the Order of Canada if the person has been convicted of a criminal offence&quot;.

Once the review process started, Black submitted a written application in defence of keeping his place in the Order of Canada, but failed in his efforts to persuade the advisory council he should appear before them to defend his case orally. Black took the matter to the Federal Court of Canada, which ruled that the council had no obligation to change its regular review process (which allows for written submissions only) simply to accommodate Black. Black attempted to appeal the court&#x27;s decision without success.

In an October 2012 interview, Black intimated that he would rather resign from the order than be removed: &quot;I would not wait for giving these junior officials the evidently almost aphrodisiacal pleasure of throwing me out. I would withdraw&quot;, he told CBC&#x27;s Susan Ormiston. &quot;In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t be interested in serving.&quot;

The Governor General of Canada, David Johnston, announced Black&#x27;s removal from the Order of Canada and his expulsion from the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada in January 2014. Johnston had been recommended to do so by the advisory council of the Order of Canada and the Canadian prime minister. As a result, Black may also no longer employ the post-nominal initials &quot;OC&quot; and &quot;PC&quot;.

===Pardon===

On 15 May 2019, US president Donald Trump granted Black a full pardon. Trump noted &quot;broad support from many high-profile individuals who have vigorously vouched for his exceptional character&quot;. Black is a friend of Trump and has written flatteringly about him in opinion articles and in the 2018 book &quot;Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other&quot;. Many news sources linked Black&#x27;s recent book and his long friendship with Trump to the pardon. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; noted, &quot;In addition to his book, Black frequently writes columns praising Trump and considers the president a friend&quot;. Upon his release from prison, Black had been deported to Canada and was previously barred from entering the US for 30 years. The pardon allows him to travel to the US.

==Investigations by the Ontario Securities Commission and Canada Revenue Agency==
In July 2013, the Ontario Securities Commission restarted its case against Black and two other former Hollinger executives, John Boultbee and Peter Atkinson. The regulator sought to have them banned from trading in the province&#x27;s capital markets or sitting on a public board of directors. The case alleged violations of the &quot;Securities Act (Ontario)&quot;. The case had been postponed pending the exhaustion of Black&#x27;s appeals of his US fraud convictions. The securities case alleges that Black and his two fellow directors created a scheme was to use the sale of several Hollinger newspapers in order to &quot;divert certain proceeds from Hollinger Inc. to themselves through contrived &#x27;non-compete&#x27; payments&quot;.

Black applied to have the proceedings dismissed on the grounds that he was already voluntarily refraining from being an officer or director of an Ontario corporation and undertaken to ask the approval of the OSC if he ever desired to become a director or officer of an Ontario public company. In February 2015 the OSC placed a permanent ban on Black being a director or officer of a publicly traded company in Ontario, but declined to restrict his right to trade. Black referred to the case in his column in the National Post on 8 March 2015, stating that the OSC did not come to the subject with clean hands, having &quot;vaporized&quot; hundreds of millions of dollars of shareholder&#x27;s equity in 2005 when it blocked Black&#x27;s bid to privatize Hollinger Inc., pushing that company into bankruptcy and a total loss for the shareholders.

In early 2014, the Tax Court of Canada ruled that Black owed the Canadian government taxes on $5.1 million of income accrued in 2002.

In mid-May 2016, it was revealed that the CRA had intervened to prevent the sale and lease-back, with a buy-back option, of Black&#x27;s home on Park Lane Circle. After discussion, the sale-lease back proceeded and Black provided other assets as security pending the settlement or adjudication of the CRA claim.

On 14 June 2019, the Tax Court of Canada ruled that Black is entitled to deduct interest expenses on a $32.3 million loan he used to satisfy judgments against himself and Hollinger International.

==Peerage controversy and citizenship==
In 2001, British prime minister Tony Blair advised Queen Elizabeth II to confer on Black a life peerage in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His name had been put forward by the Conservative leader William Hague, and he would sit as a Conservative peer. Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien advised Elizabeth not to appoint Black a peer, citing the Nickle Resolution of 1919 and a long history since then of objections to Canadian citizens accepting British peerages. Black at the time held both Canadian and British citizenship. Black pointed out that the Nickle Resolution referred to Canadian resident citizens, not dual citizens living in the United Kingdom, and was not binding, but when Blair said that Elizabeth would prefer not to choose between the conflicting recommendations of two prime ministers of countries of which she was the monarch, Black asked that the matter be deferred. He litigated in Canada, claiming that Chrétien had no jurisdiction to create a class of citizen in another country, consisting of one person (as there were other dual citizens in the House of Lords), ineligible to receive an honour in that country for services deemed to have been rendered in that country, because of the objections of the Canadian prime minister of the day. Later in 2001, after the Ontario Superior Court and Court of Appeal had ruled that they had no jurisdiction in this area, Black renounced his Canadian citizenship, remaining a United Kingdom citizen, which allowed him to accept the peerage without further controversy. He was created &quot;Baron Black of Crossharbour&quot; on 30 October 2001.

Black sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative until 2007, when the party whip was withdrawn following his conviction in the United States. He subsequently sat as a non-affiliated member of the Lords. In an interview with BBC reporter Jeremy Paxman in 2012, Black stated that he could return to the House of Lords as a voting member; comparing himself to Nelson Mandela, Black said that a criminal conviction did not prohibit him from sitting, since the House of Lords had no restriction on such a case. This situation was later changed under the House of Lords Reform Act 2014, which allowed members to be expelled following a criminal conviction.

In an interview with Peter Mansbridge in May 2012, Black said he would consider applying for Canadian citizenship &quot;within a few years&quot;, when he hoped the matter would no longer be controversial and he could &quot;make an application like any other person who has been a temporary resident&quot;. Black regained his Canadian citizenship in 2023. At that time, Black said he intended to resume his legislative work in the House of Lords.

Black ceased to be a member of the House of Lords on 9 July 2024 under the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 because of non-attendance in the preceding session of Parliament. He told CBC News that he was not aware of the cessation of his membership and that it did not matter to him.

Called &quot;Roosevelt and the Revisionists&quot; and based on his earlier biography of Roosevelt, it argued that FDR&#x27;s New Deal was intended to save capitalism, and deserved conservative support. In her 9 March critique of this piece on NRO, author Amity Shlaes observed, &quot;I will be co-hosting, with Dean Thomas Cooley of NYU/Stern, a &quot;Second Look&quot; conference on 30 March to permit scholars to present the multiple studies that suggest the New Deal and Great Depression are worth taking a look at from every angle. The great shame here is that Conrad would have added much to this event, and yet he cannot attend.&quot;

==Biographies and portrayal in popular culture==
* The book &quot;The Establishment Man&quot;, sub-titled &quot;A Portrait of Power&quot;, by Peter C. Newman, detailing Black&#x27;s early career, was published in 1982 by McClelland and Stewart; 
* The documentary film &quot;Citizen Black&quot;, which premiered at the 2004 Montreal and Cambridge film festivals, traces Black&#x27;s life and filmmaker Debbie Melnyk&#x27;s attempts in 2003 to interview Black, and her eventual interview. US prosecutors subpoenaed unused footage of a 2003 shareholders meeting for use in Black&#x27;s trial.
* Canadian actor Albert Schultz portrayed Black in the 2006 CTV movie &quot;Shades of Black&quot;.
* Tom Bower&#x27;s biography &quot;Conrad and Lady Black: Dancing on the Edge&quot; () was published in 2006 by HarperCollins. It was republished in August 2007 with an additional chapter reporting on the trial and its outcomes.
* A book, &quot;Robber Baron: Lord Black of Crossharbour&quot;, was published in 2007 by ECW press and written by George Tombs; 
* Canadian artist George Walker published the wordless novel &quot;The Life and Times of Conrad Black&quot; in 2013.
* Black appeared as a guest on the British television panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; on 26 October 2012, in which Black says, incorrectly, that the jury gave him &quot;nine acquittals complemented by a unanimous vacation of the four guilty verdicts by the Supreme Court of the US&quot;, and also says &quot;the [US] Supreme Court released me in order to come back here [the United Kingdom] and try and help enlighten you with the crisis you&#x27;re having with the badgers.&quot;
* Black is a character in Joseph O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dog.&quot;
* Black is referred to by the character Douglas Reynholm in the BBC sitcom &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; as “The first rich person to go to prison in 300 years.”

<text>Velvalee Dickinson (October 12, 1893 – ca 1980) was an American spy convicted of espionage against the United States on behalf of Japan during World War II. Known as the &quot;Doll Woman&quot;, she used her business in New York City to send information on the United States Navy to contacts in Argentina via steganographic messages. She was finally caught when one of her contacts in Buenos Aires moved and her messages were returned.

==Early life and career==
Born as Velvalee Malvena Blucher in Sacramento, California to Otto and Elizabeth Blucher (or Blueher). She graduated from Stanford University in 1918 but did not receive her Bachelor of Arts degree until January 1937, allegedly because she had not returned books owned by the university.

In the late 1920s to the mid-1930s, Dickinson was employed in a brokerage company in San Francisco, California, owned by her future husband, Lee T. Dickinson. Shortly after her marriage, Dickinson worked as a social worker in the area until 1937. The firm did business with Japanese people and the Dickinsons&#x27; interest in Japan grew so much that they joined the Japanese-American Society, where they began to rub shoulders with members of the Japanese consulate. The FBI later also determined that she had made frequent visits to the consulate, attended important social gatherings at which Japanese Navy members and other high Japanese government officials were present, and entertained many Japanese people in her home. When the brokerage firm&#x27;s success suffered a downturn, so too did the Dickinsons&#x27; role as proponents of good Japanese-American relations.
In 1937, the Dickinsons moved to New York City, where Velvalee worked for a short time as a department store employee. On December 31, 1937, she began operating her own doll shop, first at her residence at 680 Madison Ave and later at a separate store at 714 Madison Avenue, where she operated for several years until she moved the store down the block, to 718 Madison Avenue in October 1941. The Dickinson doll shop catered to affluent collectors throughout the United States and overseas interested in obtaining foreign, regional, and antique dolls. Lee Dickinson assisted his wife&#x27;s business by handling the accounting until his death, on March 29, 1943.

==Case==
In February 1942, a letter was brought to the attention of the FBI, intercepted by wartime censors. The letter, supposedly from a woman in Portland, Oregon to a correspondent in Buenos Aires, discussed a &quot;wonderful doll hospital&quot; and noted that the writer had sent the correspondent &quot;three Old English dolls&quot; for repairs. The letter also mentioned &quot;fish nets&quot; and &quot;balloons&quot;. Elizebeth Friedman&#x27;s cryptanalysis unit at US Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington examined the letter and broke the code, concluding that the &quot;dolls&quot; were actually three warships and that the &quot;doll hospital&quot; was a West Coast-based shipyard where repairs were made, while the &quot;fishing nets&quot; and &quot;balloons&quot; disclosed information about coastal defenses and other critical information on the West Coast.

Based on the above letter, the FBI initiated an espionage investigation. During that time, four more letters were sent to the same Buenos Aires address, a Señora Inés López de Molinali at 2563 O&#x27;Higgins Street. However, the letters were returned to sender, due to &quot;address unknown&quot;; these letters were delivered to postal authorities and in turn handed over to the FBI. The people whose names had appeared on the envelope as senders stated that while the letters contained information that was correct to their personal lives and hobbies, and that the signatures on stated letters resembled theirs, all four vehemently denied that they had sent any of the letters to the Argentine address.

One of the letters, supposedly sent by a Mary Wallace of Springfield, Ohio, did indicate her home address – 1808 E High Street – but had been postmarked in New York, a place she had never been. The letter, primarily discussing dolls, contained references to a &quot;Mr. Shaw, who had been ill but would be back to work soon.&quot; The letter corresponded to information that the destroyer USS &quot;Shaw&quot;, which had been damaged in the Pearl Harbor attack, completed repairs on the West Coast and was soon to rejoin the Pacific Fleet.

Another letter, given to the FBI in August of that year and said to have been written by a woman in Colorado Springs, Colorado, was postmarked from Oakland, California. That letter, written in February, made reference to seven small dolls which the writer stated would be altered to look as though they were &quot;seven real Chinese dolls&quot;, designed to mimic a family of parents, grandparents and three children. The FBI determined that the letter was written shortly after a convoy of ships had arrived at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. The letter contained certain details about the ships, that if made public, would have been detrimental to the war effort.

The same woman also gave the FBI a letter returned to her by the Post Office earlier that month. The second letter, from May, and postmarked from Portland, Oregon, discussed the acquisition of a &quot;Siamese Temple Dancer&quot; doll. A portion of the letter read:

[I]t had been damaged, that is tore in the middle. But it is now repaired and I like it very much. I could not get a mate for this Siam dancer, so I am redressing just a small plain ordinary doll into a second Siam doll.

Cryptographers determined this to translate as, &quot;I just secured information on an aircraft carrier warship, it had been damaged, that is torpedoed in the middle. But it is now repaired ... [t]hey could not get a mate for this so a plain ordinary warship is being converted into a second aircraft carrier ...&quot; The information matched damage done to the aircraft carrier , which had seen repairs in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard before being transferred to the Naval Base at San Diego, California.

A third letter, handed to the FBI by a woman in Spokane, Washington and bearing a postmark from Seattle made reference to a &quot;German bisque doll, dressed in a hula grass skirt&quot;, sent to Seattle for repairs that would be completed sometime around the first week of February. Naval authorities confirmed to the FBI that a ship damaged at Pearl Harbor was in Puget Sound for repairs and would be completed around the time stated in the letter.

A forensics examination of all letters concerned confirmed that the signatures were forgeries, based on copies of the original signatures. The examination also indicated that while different typewriters were used to compose the letters, the typing characteristics indicated that the letters were composed by a single individual. The conclusion reached by the examiners was that the letters contained codetext conveying information on the US Navy&#x27;s ships and their location, condition, repair and status, with emphasis on ships damaged at Pearl Harbor.

==Investigation==
The Colorado Springs woman pointed the FBI in the direction of Dickinson, the New York doll shop owner. She believed that Dickinson had forged her signature on one of the letters in vengeance, because the woman had been late in paying for some dolls that she had purchased from the Dickinson shop. Based on investigations with Wallace and the other woman involved, all agreed in their suspicion that Dickinson was the suspect; additionally, all four women had at one time corresponded with Dickinson regarding doll collecting. Typewritten letters between Dickinson and the women involved were identified by the FBI as having been used in the &quot;Springfield&quot; letter.

An investigation into Dickinson&#x27;s background indicated her involvement with Japanese organizations while living in San Francisco, as well as that after moving to New York, she had visited the Nippon Club and the Japanese Institute in New York, become a friend of the Japanese Consul General and was an acquaintance of Ichiro Yokoyama, the Japanese Naval Attaché in Washington, D.C. Further investigation of the Dickinsons&#x27; activities from January to June 1942 (the time frame in which the letters were sent) revealed that the couple had visited those areas, staying in hotels near the cities in question. The FBI was also able to determine that typewriters owned and made available to guests were used to compose the letters sent to Argentina. Continuing investigations disclosed that Dickinson had borrowed money from banks and business associates in New York up until 1941; however, in 1943, she was reported to have had in her possession a large number of $100 bills, four of which were traced to Japanese official sources that had received the money prior to the war.

Based on the results of the investigation, FBI agents arrested Dickinson on January 21, 1944, in the bank vault where she kept her safe deposit box. The box contained $13,000 () and was eventually traced to Japanese sources. A portion of the money had been in the hands of a Captain Yuzo Ishikawa of the Japanese Naval Inspector&#x27;s Office in New York before being transferred to Dickinson.

Dickinson told the agents that the money in the safe deposit box had come from insurance companies, a savings account and her doll business, but in a subsequent interview, she claimed that she had found the money hidden in her husband&#x27;s bed at the time of his death. She claimed that her husband had not told her the source of the money, but she believed that it could have come from the Japanese consulate in New York City.

==Trial and conviction==
On February 11, 1944, she was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for violation of the censorship statutes, conviction of which could result in a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine. She pleaded not guilty and was held in lieu of $25,000 bail. A continuing investigation by the FBI resulted in a second indictment on May 5, this time on charges of violating espionage statutes, the Trading with the Enemy Act, and the censorship statutes, which carried a possible death sentence. She pleaded not guilty and was released on the same bail.

On July 28, 1944, a plea bargain was made between the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office and Dickinson in which the espionage and Trade Act indictments were dismissed and she pleaded guilty to the censorship violation and agreed to furnish information in her possession concerning Japanese intelligence activities.

After pleading guilty, she admitted that she had typed the five forged letters addressed to Argentina, using correspondence with her customers to forge their signatures.

She claimed the information compiled in her letters was from asking innocent and unsuspecting citizens in Seattle and San Francisco near the location of the Navy yards there, as well as some details from personal observation. She stated that the letters transmitted information about ships damaged at Pearl Harbor and that the names of the dolls corresponded to a list that explained the type of ships involved. She furthermore stated that the code to be used in the letters, instructions for use of the code, and $25,000 in $100 bills had been passed to her husband by Yokoyama around November 26, 1941, in her doll store at 718 Madison Avenue for the purpose of supplying information to the Japanese. She repeated her claims that the money had been hidden in her husband&#x27;s bed until his death.

However, an investigation by the FBI refuted those claims, disclosing that while Dickinson had been a friend of Yokoyama, her husband had never met him. It was also learned that a physical examination done on him at the time indicated that his mental faculties were impaired at the time of the supposed payment. Both a nurse and a maid employed by the Dickinsons at the time emphatically stated that no money had ever been concealed there.

Velvalee Dickinson appeared in court for sentencing on August 14, 1944. Upon sentencing, the court commented:
It is hard to believe that some people do not realize that our country is engaged in a life and death struggle. Any help given to the enemy means the death of American boys who are fighting for our national security. You, as a natural-born citizen, having a University education, and selling out to the Japanese, were certainly engaged in espionage. I think that you have been given every consideration by the Government. The indictment to which you have pleaded guilty is a serious matter. It borders close to treason. I, therefore, sentence you to the maximum penalty provided by the law, which is ten years and $10,000 fine.

Still maintaining her innocence and claiming that her husband had been the Japanese spy, Dickinson was imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution for Women (now the Alderson Federal Prison Camp) in Alderson, West Virginia. She was released with conditions on April 23, 1951.

After her release, she changed her name to Catherine Dickerson and maintained a friendship and secretarial relationship with Eunice Kennedy, attending her wedding in 1953.

<text>A cutlass is a short, broad sabre or slashing sword with a straight or slightly curved blade sharpened on the cutting edge and a hilt often featuring a solid cupped or basket-shaped guard. It was a common naval weapon during the early Age of Sail.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;cutlass&quot; developed from the 17th-century English use of &quot;coutelas&quot;, a 16th-century French word for a machete-like mid-length single-edged blade (the modern French for &quot;knife&quot;, in general, is &quot;couteau&quot;; in 17th- and 18th-century English the word was often spelled &quot;cuttoe&quot;). The French word &quot;coutelas&quot; may be a convergent development from a Latin root, along with the Italian &quot;coltellaccio&quot; or &quot;cortelazo&quot;, meaning &quot;large knife&quot;.
In Italy, the &quot;cortelazo&quot; was a similar short, broad-bladed sabre popular during the 16th century.
The root &quot;coltello&quot;, for &quot;knife&quot;, derived ultimately from the Latin &quot;cultellus&quot; meaning &quot;smaller knife&quot;, which is the common Latin root for both the Italian and French words.

In the English-speaking Caribbean, the word &quot;cutlass&quot; is also used as a word for machete.

==History and use==


===Origin===
The cutlass is a 17th-century descendant of the edged short sword, exemplified by the medieval falchion.

Woodsmen and soldiers in the 17th and 18th centuries used a similar short and broad backsword called a &quot;hanger&quot;, or in German a &quot;messer&quot;, meaning &quot;knife&quot;. Often occurring with the full tang (i.e. slab tang) more typical of daggers than swords in Europe, these blades may ultimately derive through the falchion (facon, falcon, fauchard) from the falx or seax.

In England, about 1685 the rather long straight-bladed sword formerly in use began to be superseded by the &quot;hanger&quot;. This weapon had a short and more or less curved single-edged blade with a brass hilt of a rather flat double-shell and knuckle-bow. The grip was generally of wood, bound with wire, but some specimens show a brass grip with spiral grooves. These are probably early models. The length of the blade is usually about .

===History===

Although also used on land, the cutlass is best known as the sailor&#x27;s preferred weapon, as it was robust enough to hack or cut through heavy ropes, thick canvas, and dense vegetation while being short enough to be used in relatively close quarters combat, such as during boarding actions, in the rigging, or below decks. Another advantage to the cutlass was its simplicity of use, as it required less training than that required to master a rapier or small sword.

Cutlasses are famous for being used by pirates, although there is no reason to believe that Caribbean buccaneers invented them, as has occasionally been claimed. However, the subsequent use of cutlasses by pirates is well documented in contemporary sources, notably by the pirate crews of William Fly, William Kidd, and Stede Bonnet. French historian Alexandre Exquemelin reports the buccaneer François l&#x27;Ollonais using a cutlass as early as 1667. Pirates used these weapons for intimidation as much as for combat, often needing no more than to grip their hilts to induce a crew to surrender, or beating captives with the flat of the blade to force their compliance or responsiveness to interrogation.

Owing to its versatility, the cutlass was as often an agricultural implement and tool as it was a weapon (cf. machete, to which the same comment applies). It was used commonly in rain forest and sugarcane areas, such as the Caribbean and Central America. In their most simplified form they are held to have become the machete of the Caribbean.

The leadcutter sword was a weapon modelled on the cutlass, designed for use in shows and demonstrations of swordsmanship in the late Victorian era. Wilkinson Sword made these swords in four sizes, no. 1 to no. 4, of increasing weight to suit the strength of the user. The leadcutter was so named because in demonstrations it was used to cut a lead bar in half. Wilkinson included a mould for the lead bar with each purchase of their swords.

===Modern history===
In 1830, after a constable of the London Metropolitan Police was shot and stabbed while on duty, the Home Secretary ordered that each police officer in the force &quot;should be issued with a cutlass for his defence&quot;; training in their use was provided at Wellington Barracks. Initially carried while on night duty, they were soon relegated to being kept in the local inspector&#x27;s office for use in an emergency. Provincial police forces sometimes deployed cutlasses during public disorder, using the hilts and flat edges of the blades to strike rioters, but there is no record of anyone being killed with one. The last recorded issue of police cutlasses was during the Tottenham Outrage, an armed robbery in 1909.

In 1936, the British Royal Navy announced that from then on cutlasses would be carried only for ceremonial duties and not used in landing parties. The last recorded use of cutlasses by the Royal Navy is often said to be on 16 February 1940 during the boarding action known as the Altmark Incident. However, this is disbelieved by the majority of the HMS &quot;Cossack&quot; Association (&quot;Cossack&quot; was the ship that boarded &quot;Altmark&quot;) and the authors of &quot;British Naval Swords and Swordsmanship&quot;. The authors point to another claim, a boarding by HMS &quot;Armada&quot; in 1952, but disbelieve this one too. In their view, the last use of cutlasses by the Royal Navy was by a shore party in China in 1900. Cutlasses continue to be worn in the Royal Navy by Chief Petty Officers when escorting the White Ensign and by Senior or Leading Ratings as part of an escort at a court-martial.

The cutlass remained an official weapon in the United States Navy until it was stricken from the Navy&#x27;s active inventory in 1949. The cutlass was seldom used for weapons training after the early 1930s. The last new model of cutlass adopted by the US Navy was the US M1917 cutlass, adopted during World War I; it was based on the Dutch M1898 klewang. Although cutlasses were still being made during World War II under the US M1941 designation, this was only a slightly modified variant of the US M1917 cutlass. A US Marine Combat Engineer NCO is reported to have killed an enemy combatant with a US M1941 cutlass at the Battle of Inchon during the Korean War. A cutlass is still carried by the recruit designated as the Recruit Chief Petty Officer for each recruit division while at the US Navy Recruit Training Command. In a message released 31 March 2010, the US Navy approved optional wear of a ceremonial cutlass as part of the Chief Petty Officer dress uniform, pending final design approval. That approval came in January 2011, and the cutlass was made available for ceremonial wear by Chief Petty Officers in August of that same year.

<text>Alexander Davidovich Brener () (born 1957, in Alma-Ata, Kazak ASSR, Soviet Union), is a Russian performance artist and a self-described political activist. He is considered one of the main figures of Moscow Actionism along with Oleg Kulik.

==Work==
Brener&#x27;s performances of note include defecating in front of a painting by Vincent van Gogh at the Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow, having sex in front of the Monument to Alexander Pushkin (Rostov-on-Don), and vandalizing art works by other artists.

He was jailed in 1997 for painting a green dollar sign on Kazimir Malevich&#x27;s painting &quot;Suprematisme&quot;. In the court case Brener said in his defense:

:&quot;The cross is a symbol of suffering, the dollar sign a symbol of trade and merchandise. On humanitarian grounds are the ideas of Jesus Christ of higher significance than those of the money. What I did was not against the painting. I view my act as a dialogue with Malevich.&quot;

Giancarlo Politi, the editor of Flash Art, resolutely defended Brener from the pages of his magazine, stirring controversy and campaigning for his acquittal. Brener was sentenced to five months in prison, where he wrote the essay &quot;Obossani Pistolet&quot;. In the text he explains his beliefs and summarizes his actions. In 2000 Brener disrupted the press conference of Manifesta 3 in Ljubljana by spraying slogans on the presentation screen and handing out leaflets stating: &quot;Demolish neo-liberalist multicultural art system now!&quot; Bodyguards came and dragged Brener out of the hall. He was later arrested by Slovenian secret police in the streets. In 2003 Brener vandalized the work of Swiss-Italian artist Gianni Motti during the opening of Motti&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Turnover&quot; at Artra Gallery in Milan.

Brener co-wrote a number of books together with Austrian artist and critic Barbara Schurz, including &quot;Bukaka spat Here&quot;, &quot;Tattoos auf Gefängnissen&quot;, &quot;Anti Technologies of Resistance&quot; and &quot;The Art of Destruction&quot;.

Brener is mentioned in passing in Stewart Home&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;Memphis Underground&quot;.

An artwork by the art collective IOCOSE is dedicated to Brener.

<text>Barbara Schurz (Russian transliteration: Барбара Шурц) (born 1973) is an Austrian artist and self-described &quot;revolutionary activist&quot;.

==Life and work==

At Vienna University she pursued Slavic Studies and Women&#x27;s Studies. Subsequently, she studied conceptual art at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. She began traveling around the world, living as an artist and author in Moscow and Berlin, in addition to Vienna.

Schurz is best known for her books, co-written with Alexander Brener, that address the boundary between art and politics from an activist perspective. These are heavily influenced by poststructuralism, particularly the writings of Michel Foucault, and focus their attacks largely on capitalism and imperialism. Schurz accompanied Brener to the &#x27;Violence to Endurance: Extreme Curating&#x27; art lecture at the ICA to both protest and involve themselves in the lecture. While there Brener defecated in front of the audience while Schurz threw peanuts at the lecturers.

<text>Brian Vincent Tobin (born October 21, 1954) is a Canadian businessman and former politician. Tobin served as the sixth premier of Newfoundland from 1996 to 2000. Tobin was also a prominent Member of Parliament and served as a cabinet minister in Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Liberal government.

== Early life, education, and family ==
Tobin was born in Stephenville, Newfoundland. He studied political science at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John&#x27;s. He worked a brief stint as a TV news announcer with NBC (now NTV) before joining the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador as a political aide to former federal Member of Parliament (MP) and federal cabinet minister Don Jamieson.

Tobin is married to Jodean (Smith) and they have three children: Heather, Adam, and Jack.

== Political career ==
Tobin was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal in the 1980 election. He was re-elected in the 1984 election even though Brian Mulroney&#x27;s, Progressive Conservative Party (PC) won the largest majority government in Canadian history. It was at this time however that Tobin gained prominence as a member of the &quot;Rat Pack&quot;, which was the nickname given to a group of young, high-profile Canadian Liberal opposition MPs during Mulroney&#x27;s government.

=== In government ===
Following the 1993 election in which the Liberals regained power from the Progressive Conservatives after almost a decade in opposition, Tobin was appointed Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.

In the ministry, Tobin distinguished himself from his colleagues with speeches rife with rhetoric and his youthful exuberance. Throughout 1994 he mounted a fierce campaign against foreign over-fishing of waters on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks, located just outside Canada&#x27;s declared 200 nautical mile (370 km) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). People across Canada took notice of this new and aggressive posture, a position that had not been taken by a federal minister—Liberal or Conservative—since the EEZ was declared in 1977.

Critics note that Tobin was likely doing this to preserve his political life in his home province. At this point, Newfoundland and Labrador was wracked by rapidly rising unemployment and social unrest over the fiscal situation which many believed had been caused by federal mismanagement of foreign and domestic overfishing. This had resulted in the 1992 &quot;Northern Cod Moratorium.&quot; In April 1995, Tobin&#x27;s department was embroiled in the Turbot War (known in Spain as Guerra del Fletán). He received full backing of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the pursuit. Later that month, Tobin conducted an international news conference from a barge on the East River outside the United Nations headquarters and dramatically displayed an illegal, under Canadian Law, trawl net that had allegedly been cut from a Spanish trawler which was arrested outside the Canadian EEZ, on international waters. The net was over 16 stories high and was hung from a crane causing a media sensation. Tobin was accused by the arrested shipmen of ill-intentionally orchestrating a media-oriented frame-up to mislead attention from economic and public image problems Canada was facing.

Tobin helped organize a pro-Canada rally in Montreal before the October 1995 Quebec referendum—busing in thousands of university students and other residents from English Canada. For his roles as Fisheries Minister and in the referendum, he earned the nickname &quot;Captain Canada&quot;.

=== Premier of Newfoundland ===
In 1996, Tobin resigned from federal politics to succeed Clyde Wells as leader of the governing Liberal Party of Newfoundland and premier. The Liberal Party won a large majority government later that year. During his time as premier Tobin pursued tough negotiations with out-of-province companies seeking to export resources for refining and smelting elsewhere. He insisted that the resources will never be mined unless Newfoundlanders received secondary manufacturing and tertiary service spin-offs. A similar tough stance was taken in seeking to develop the Lower Churchill River, keeping in mind the contract his predecessor Joey Smallwood had negotiated. His Liberals won re-election in 1999.

It was also during this time in the lead-up to the millennium that Newfoundland undertook an aggressive tourism marketing campaign which focused on important anniversaries such as the 500th year since John Cabot&#x27;s voyage of discovery (1997), as well as the 1000th year since Vikings, such as Leif Ericson, made landfall on the province&#x27;s shores (2000).

=== Return to federal politics ===
In October 2000, Tobin suddenly resigned to join the federal Cabinet and run for re-election to the House of Commons in a snap election called by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson on the advice of her prime minister, Jean Chrétien. Chrétien advised that his friend be appointed as Minister of Industry before the election, replacing John Manley, and Tobin was easily elected in the riding of Bonavista—Trinity—Conception. His departure from the premiership caused speculation among Newfoundlanders and Canadians about his aspirations for the leadership of the federal Liberals following what was assumed would be Chrétien&#x27;s final term as prime minister. Tobin&#x27;s position in Industry would allow him to develop a relationship with the nation&#x27;s business leaders who would ultimately be financing any potential leadership campaign. In January 2002, Tobin abruptly resigned both his cabinet portfolio and parliament seat. Observers interpreted that his departure of federal politics was due to his frustration at the stranglehold on the future leadership of the Liberal party by the then Minister of Finance, Paul Martin, and possibly because Chrétien had promoted Manley to Deputy Prime Minister.

== Post-political career ==
In retirement from politics, Tobin has served on the board of several Canadian corporations. He became CEO of Magna International Developments (MID), controller of Magna&#x27;s vast real estate and horse track holdings, the latter through Magna Entertainment Corporation. After only a few months in the position, he left after disagreements with Magna chairman and controlling shareholder Frank Stronach. The dispute was supposedly over the propriety of a share buyback program, while others suggested that it was because Stronach would not give Tobin autonomy to operate. Tobin has since joined the libertarian think-tank the Fraser Institute. In the past, Tobin had referred to the Fraser Institute and its fellows as &quot;Loony-Tunes&quot;. It is there that Tobin began his association with the ideas and political plans of Preston Manning and Mike Harris. Tobin is also a Senior Business Advisor with Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP in Toronto and is a member of the firm&#x27;s Public Policy Group.Through his involvement in policy decisions first entered as ideals at the Fraser Institute, Tobin has influenced the sale of energy interests in Alberta including the sale of two billion dollars worth of Alberta oil and gas interests to Abu Dhabi a Middle Eastern company through their Houston affiliate as shown on the Fraser Milner Casgrain website.

In 2003, Tobin authored his biography titled &quot;All In Good Time&quot;.

With the defeat of the Liberals in the 2006 Canadian federal election to Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservatives, Prime Minister Martin resigned from the leadership of the party. There were frequent rumors that Tobin, and other former cabinet colleagues Allan Rock and John Manley would run to succeed Martin. On January 31, 2006, Tobin officially announced that he would not be running for the federal Liberal leadership.

On December 25, 2010, Tobin&#x27;s son Jack was charged with impaired driving causing death over an incident in which his best friend, Alex Zolpis, was killed. His son later pleaded guilty and was granted full parole just over a year into a three-year sentence.

He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada on 19 November 2012. His citation reads:
Brian Tobin is highly regarded for his strong and principled leadership. As a federal cabinet minister, he was instrumental in leading the implementation of the &quot;Oceans Act&quot;, which provides a unique framework for modern ocean management. He also took a strong stance against offshore over-fishing by foreign fleets. His term as premier of Newfoundland and Labrador was marked by important economic reforms to traditional industries, the modernization of the educational system, and the development of the offshore oil and gas industry. In the corporate sector, he is known for his commitment to sound governance and corporate social responsibility.

In April 2013, BMO Capital Markets, the investment and corporate banking arm of BMO Financial Group, announced that it hired Tobin as Vice-Chair.

<doc id="226105" wikidata="Q4908833" url="?curid=226105" title="Bill Drummond">
<text>William Ernest Drummond (born 29 April 1953) is a Scottish artist, musician, writer, and record producer. He was a co-founder of the late-1980s avant-garde pop group the KLF and its 1990s media-manipulating successor, the K Foundation, with which he burned £1 million in 1994. 

During their career, the KLF released four studio albums – &quot;1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)&quot; (1987), &quot;Who Killed The JAMs?&quot; (1988), &quot;Chill Out&quot; (1990) and their most commercially successful album, &quot;The White Room&quot; (1991), which spawned internationally successful singles such as re–worked versions of &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot;, &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot;, &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot; and a new track, &quot;Justified &amp; Ancient&quot; which featured American country singer Tammy Wynette. 

Following their performance at the 1992 BRIT Awards, the KLF announced their departure from the music business and, in May of that year, they deleted their entire back-catalogue. Although the duo remained true to their word of May 1992, with the KLF Communications catalogue remaining deleted, they have released a small number of new tracks since then, as the K Foundation, the One World Orchestra, and in 1997, as 2K. Drummond and Jimmy Cauty reappeared in 2017 as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, releasing the novel &quot;2023&quot;, and rebooting an earlier campaign to build a &quot;People&#x27;s Pyramid&quot;. In January 2021, the band began uploading their previously deleted catalogue onto streaming services, in compilations.

More recent art activities, carried out under Drummond&#x27;s banner of Penkiln Burn, include making and distributing cakes, soup, flowers, beds, and shoe-shines. More recent music projects include No Music Day and the international tour of a choir called The 17. Drummond is the author of several books about art and music.

==Background==
William Ernest Drummond was born in Butterworth, South Africa, where his father was a minister for the Church of Scotland. His family moved back to Scotland when he was 18 months old, and his early years were spent in the town of Newton Stewart.

He moved to Corby, Northamptonshire at the age of 11. It was here that he first became involved in performing as a musician, initially working with school friends such as Gary Carson and Chris Ward. 

He lived on the Beanfield Estate, where his father was the priest of the St Peter and St Andrew church. He attended Beanfield Secondary Modern School gaining four O-levels, and the sixth form of Kingswood School, where he was expelled in the sixth form.

He attended the University of Northampton and the Art and Design Academy from 1970 to 1973. He later decided that &quot;art should use everything, be everywhere&quot; and that, as an artist, he would &quot;use whatever medium is to hand&quot;. He spent two years working as a milkman, gardener, steel worker, nursing assistant, theatre carpenter, and scene painter. Drummond also worked on a trawler.

=== Personal life ===
Drummond is a fan of Scottish football club Queen of the South, which he says is due to their proximity to his home town of Newton Stewart. &quot;Queen of the South&quot; is also the title of the sixth track on his 1986 album, &quot;The Man&quot;.

==Career==
===1970s: &quot;Illuminatus&quot;, Big in Japan, and Zoo===
In 1975 Drummond began working at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool as a carpenter and scene painter. In 1976 he was the set designer for the first stage production of &quot;The Illuminatus Trilogy&quot;, a 12-hour performance which opened on 23 November 1976, and which was staged by Ken Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool&quot;. The production transferred to the National Theatre, and then the Roundhouse, in London. According to Campbell, Drummond became known as &quot;the man who went for Araldite&quot;: &quot;In the middle of a tour, Drummond announced he was popping out to get some glue – and never returned.&quot; Drummond later wrote that none of his career would have happened as it did if not for what he learnt from Campbell, starting with the advice &quot;Bill, don&#x27;t bother doing anything unless it is heroic!&quot;

After absconding from the &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; production in London, Drummond returned to Liverpool and co-founded the band Big in Japan. Other members included Holly Johnson (Frankie Goes to Hollywood), Budgie (Siouxsie and the Banshees), Jayne Casey (Pink Military/Pink Industry) and Ian Broudie (The Lightning Seeds). After the band&#x27;s demise, Drummond and another member, his best friend David Balfe, founded Zoo Records. Zoo&#x27;s first release was Big in Japan&#x27;s posthumous EP, &quot;From Y To Z and Never Again&quot;. They went on to act as producers of the debut albums by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and The Teardrop Explodes, both of which Drummond would later manage somewhat idiosyncratically. With Zoo Music Ltd, Drummond and Balfe were also music publishers for Zodiac Mindwarp and The Love Reaction and The Proclaimers. The production team of Drummond and Balfe was christened The Chameleons, who recorded the single &quot;Touch&quot; together with singer Lori Lartey as Lori and the Chameleons and were involved with the production on Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s debut album, released on the Korova label.

===1980s: A&amp;R man &amp; solo recording artist===
Drummond later took a job in the mainstream music business as an A&amp;R consultant for the label WEA working with, amongst others, Strawberry Switchblade and Brilliant. In July 1986, on his 33 and a third birthday, Drummond repented his corporate involvement and resigned his job by way of a &quot;ringingly quixotic press release&quot;: &quot;I will be 33.5 (sic) years old in September, a time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top...&quot; (In an interview in December 1990, Drummond recalled spending half a million pounds at WEA on the band Brilliant – for whom he envisioned massive worldwide success – only for them to completely flop. &quot;At that point I thought &#x27;What am I doing this for?&#x27; and I got out.&quot;)

Drummond was &quot;obviously very sharp,&quot; said WEA chairman Rob Dickens, &quot;and he knew the business. But he was too radical to be happy inside a corporate structure. He was better off working as an outsider.&quot;

Later in the year, Drummond issued a solo album, &quot;The Man&quot;, a country/folk music recording, backed by Australian rock group The Triffids. The album was released on Creation Records and included the sardonic &quot;Julian Cope Is Dead&quot;, where he outlined his fantasy of shooting the Teardrop Explodes frontman in the head, to ensure the band&#x27;s early demise and subsequent legendary status. The song has commonly been seen as a reply to the Cope song &quot;Bill Drummond Said&quot;. Drummond wrote and performed &quot;The Manager&quot;, filmed by Bill Butt in which he lamented the state of the music industry and offered his services at £100 a time to help fix it; one of his complaints was about remixes: &quot;songs have to be written, not layered&quot;. The spoken-word recording also appeared as a B-side, and on some compilations as &quot;The Manager&#x27;s Speech&quot;.

&quot;The Man&quot; received positive reviews – including 4 stars from &quot;Q Magazine&quot;; and 5 from &quot;Sounds&quot; Magazine who called the album a &quot;touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement&quot;. Drummond intended to focus on writing books once &quot;The Man&quot; had been issued but, as he recalled in 1990, &quot;That only lasted three months, until I had an[other] idea for a record and got dragged back into it all&quot;.

===1987–1992: The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords and the KLF===

While out walking on New Year&#x27;s Day 1987, Drummond formulated a plan to make a hip-hop record. However, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to go and do it myself&quot;, he said. &quot;...although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew Jimmy, I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said &#x27;Let&#x27;s form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu&#x27;. And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, &#x27;where I was coming from&#x27;&quot;.

Drummond and Cauty (who Drummond had signed to Food/WEA as a member of Brilliant) released their first single, The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu&#x27;s &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, in March 1987. This was followed by an album – &quot;1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)&quot; – in June of the same year, and a high-profile copyright dispute with ABBA and the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society. A second album – &quot;Who Killed The JAMs?&quot;, also the last album under the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs) name, was released in February 1988.

Later in 1988, Drummond and Cauty released a &#x27;novelty&#x27; pop single, &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot; as The Timelords. The song reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 12 June, and charted highly in Australia and New Zealand. On the back of this success, the duo self-published a book, &quot;The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)&quot;. In late 1988, the duo and released their first singles under the moniker the KLF, &quot;Burn the Bastards&quot; and &quot;Burn the Beat&quot; (both taken from the JAMs&#x27; last album). (From late 1987, Drummond and Cauty&#x27;s independent record label had been named &quot;KLF Communications&quot;.) As the KLF, Drummond and Cauty would amass fame and fortune. &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot; – a signature song which they would revisit and revitalise several times in the coming years – saw its first release in July 1988, and its success spawned an album, &quot;The &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot; Story&quot;, in September 1989.

&quot;Chill Out&quot;, an ambient house album which had its roots in Cauty&#x27;s chill-out sessions with The Orb&#x27;s Alex Paterson, was released in February 1990. Described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the KLF&#x27;s comedown classic&quot;, &quot;Chill Out&quot; was named the fifth best dance album of all time in a 1996 &quot;Mixmag&quot; feature.

The KLF&#x27;s commercial success peaked in 1991, with &quot;The White Room&quot; album and the accompanying &quot;Stadium House&quot; singles, remixes of 1988&#x27;s &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot;, 1989&#x27;s &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot;, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot;; and &quot;Justified and Ancient&quot;, a new song based on a sample from &quot;1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)&quot; In 1992, The KLF were awarded the &quot;Best British group&quot; BRIT Award. With grindcore group Extreme Noise Terror, the KLF performed a live &quot;violently antagonistic performance&quot; of &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot; at the BRIT Awards ceremony in front of &quot;a stunned music-business audience&quot;. Later in the evening Drummond and Cauty dumped a dead sheep at the entrance to one of the post-ceremony parties. &quot;NME&quot; listed this appearance at number 4 in their &quot;top 100 rock moments&quot;, and, in 2003, &quot;The Observer&quot; named it the fifth greatest &quot;publicity stunt&quot; in the history of popular music.

On 14 May 1992, the KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the deletion of their entire back catalogue, an act which associate Scott Piering described as &quot;[throwing] away a fortune&quot;. When he left WEA, Drummond issued an enigmatic press release, this time talking of a &quot;wild and wounded, glum and glorious, shit but shining path&quot; he and Cauty had been following &quot;...these past five years. The last two of which has led us up onto the commercial high ground—we are at a point where the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what.&quot; There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was at the edge of a nervous breakdown. &quot;Vox&quot; Magazine wrote, for example, that 1992 was &quot;the year of Bill&#x27;s &#x27;breakdown&#x27;, when the KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music business, ... [and] machine gunned the tuxedo&#x27;d twats in the front row of that year&#x27;s BRIT Awards ceremony.&quot; Drummond himself said that he was on the edge of the &quot;abyss&quot;.

===1993–1997: K Foundation and other activities===

Despite the KLF&#x27;s retirement from the music business, Drummond&#x27;s involvement with Jimmy Cauty was far from over. In 1993, the pair regrouped as the K Foundation, ostensibly a foundation for the arts. They established the K Foundation art award for the &quot;&quot;worst&quot; artist of the year&quot;. The award, worth £40,000, was presented to Rachel Whiteread on 23 November 1993 outside London&#x27;s Tate Gallery. Ms Whiteread had just accepted the £20,000 1993 Turner Prize award for best British Contemporary artist inside the gallery. The K Foundation award attracted huge interest from the British broadsheet newspapers.

Infamy followed when, on 23 August 1994, the K Foundation burnt what remained of the KLF&#x27;s earnings, one million pounds, at a boathouse on the Scottish island of Jura. A film of the event – &quot;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot; – was taken on tour, with Drummond and Cauty discussing the incineration with members of the public after each screening. In 2004 Drummond admitted to the BBC that he now regretted burning the money. &quot;It&#x27;s a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn&#x27;t get any easier. I wish I could explain why I did it so people would understand.&quot;

On 4 September 1995 the duo recorded &quot;The Magnificent&quot; for &quot;The Help Album&quot;. In 1997, Drummond and Cauty briefly re-emerged as 2K and K2 Plant Hire Ltd. with various plans to &quot;Fuck the Millennium&quot;. K2 Plant Hire&#x27;s published aim was to &quot;build a massive pyramid containing one brick for every person born in the UK during the 20th century&quot; Members of the public were urged to donate bricks, with 1.5 bricks per Briton being needed to complete the project. Drummond also contributed a short story titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Grind, or How K2 Plant Hire Ltd Went to Work&quot; to the book &quot;Disco 2000&quot;.

===1997–2017: Music post-KLF===

In 1996–1997 Bill Drummond did a music project in Finland, with Mark Manning and a selection of Finnish artists. Drummond&#x27;s involvement in the music industry has been minimal since his final collaboration with Jimmy Cauty as 2K in 1997.

In 1998, the Scottish Football Association invited Drummond to write and record a theme song for the Scotland national football team&#x27;s 1998 FIFA World Cup campaign. Drummond decided against doing it (Del Amitri got the job) but he wondered if he had twisted fate by declining, because the other major football songs of that year were made by associates of his: Keith Allen (&quot;Vindaloo&quot;) and Ian Broudie (&quot;Three Lions&quot;), two men he had met on the same day when working on &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; in 1976, and former protege Ian McCulloch.

In 2000, Drummond released &quot;45&quot;, a book consisting of a &quot;series of loosely related vignettes forming the rambling diary of one year&quot;. &quot;45&quot; also explored Drummond&#x27;s KLF legacy, and was well received by the press. Drummond featured on Seeming&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;The Birdwatcher&#x27;s Guide to Atrocity&quot;, performing the spoken-word portion of &quot;Learn to Vanish&quot;. It was his first appearance on record in 20 years.

===2017–present: Return of The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu===

Drummond reunited with Jimmy Cauty in 2017. They returned as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, with a novel – &quot;2023: A Trilogy&quot; – and a 3-day event, &quot;Welcome to the Dark Ages&quot;. Cauty confirmed that the duo&#x27;s work is an ongoing project.

== Art activities and the Penkiln Burn ==
Drummond studied painting at Liverpool School of Art from 1972 to 1973. Following that, he decided that instead of limiting his practice to paint and canvas, as an artist he would use any medium that came to hand. He has said that much of his work since – including the pop-music, book-writing, and The17 choir – has been done as art.

From 1998, Drummond&#x27;s art activities have been carried out using the brand-name of the Penkiln Burn. This is the name of the river in Scotland upon the banks of which he played and fished as a boy.

In 1995, Drummond bought &quot;A Smell of Sulphur in the Wind&quot; by Richard Long, for $20,000. In Drummond&#x27;s own words, he &#x27;fell in love with Richard Long&#x27;s work because&#x27; &quot;it was art by walking and doing things on his walks.&quot; Five years later, Drummond felt that he was no longer &quot;getting his money&#x27;s worth&quot; from the photograph. He decided to try to sell it by placing a series of placards around the country. When this failed to result in its sale, in 2001 he cut the photograph and mounting card into 20,000 pieces to sell for $1 each. His plan, upon retrieving the $20,000 in cash, is to walk with it to the remote place in Iceland where Richard Long had made the photograph and bury it in a box beneath the stone circle. He will then take his own photograph of the site, bring it home, frame it, hang it in the same place in his bedroom where the Richard Long hung, and call the new work &quot;The Smell of Money Underground&quot;. Drummond&#x27;s books &quot;How to be an Artist&quot; and a later soft-bound edition titled &quot;$20,000&quot; recounts this story.

In 2002, Drummond was involved in a controversial exhibition at the deconsecrated St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Liverpool. Drummond contributed a guestbook which asked visitors &quot;Is God a Cunt?&quot;. It was later reported that the artwork had been stolen and a £1000 reward offered for its return. Drummond himself said that he would answer &quot;no&quot; to his own question: &quot;God is responsible for all the things I love, the speckles on a brown trout; the sound of Angus Young&#x27;s guitar, the nape of my girlfriend&#x27;s neck, the song of the blackcap when he returns in Spring. I never blame God for all the shit, for the baby Rwandan slaughtered in a casual genocide, the ever-present wars, drudgery and misery that fills most of our lives.&quot;

Several Penkiln Burn projects involve making things and then distributing them. Drummond has created a Soup Line drawn across a map going through Belfast and Nottingham to the edges of the British Isles. Anyone living on the Soup Line may contact Drummond to come to their house and make soup for them, their family and friends. Drummond has also constructed – and encourages others to construct – Cake Circles drawn on maps. Cakes are then made and delivered to people who live within the circle with the words &quot;I have baked you a cake, here it is&quot;. Other projects involve Drummond building beds from timber in public places which are then raffled off. In 2011, for the Venice Biennale, Drummond took up shoe-shining on the streets of Venice. Each spring, Drummond gives away 40 bunches of daffodils to strangers on the street in different cities.

Drummond&#x27;s web-based projects include MyDeath.net, where people can plan their own funeral. Another site, youwhores.com, was meant for anyone to advertise any kind of service at their own set price. Due to misuse though, youwhores.com has become archival only. Still open for contributions is Drummond&#x27;s website www.openmanifesto.com which &quot;exists to define what art is and art is not.&quot; The Open Manifesto site invites definitions of art in 100 words or less.

Drummond was a Director of The Foundry, an arts centre in Shoreditch, London which closed in 2010. He is also owner of The Curfew Tower in Cushendall, Northern Ireland. Via an arts trust called in You We Trust, the Curfew Tower acts as an artists&#x27; residency.

===No Music Day===
In 2005, Drummond announced an annual No Music Day on 21 November. The 22 November is Saint Cecilia day – the Patron Saint of Music – so No Music Day represents a fast before the feast. No Music Day was held between 2005 and 2010. In this time, BBC Radio Scotland observed it by broadcasting no music, including jingles, for 24 hours. Radio Resonance FM also acknowledged it. In 2009 the entire city of Linz, Austria observed No Music Day with the backing of the city mayor; music was not played on local radio stations or in shops, and the cinemas only showed films without music soundtracks. 

=== The 17 ===

Drummond&#x27;s most recent music project is a choir, the 17. His first formal performance of The 17 was staged with 16 other men in a studio in Leicester in 2004. It followed thoughts about music that Drummond had been having for many years. With the advent of recorded music via the internet, iPods and MP3 players etc. Drummond proclaims that &quot;all recorded music has run its course.&quot; The 17 creates music that follows no musical history, or necessarily has words, melodies or rhythms. It may be made up of many human voices or none. Performances may only be recorded and played back once and then deleted. The 17 can be made up of as many people who want to be a part of it at the time of a performance; they are all then lifetime members.

After the first 17 Scores for The 17 Drummond opened the writing process to collaborations with The 17 members. The 17 now has several thousand members who have carried out performances on Drummond&#x27;s Coast-to-Coast tour across the UK, and a World Tour which has included Jerusalem, Beijing, Port-au-Prince and Gothenburg. 100 performances REPEAT in the town of Derby as a residency for the new Quad arts centre titled &quot;Slice Through Derby&quot;, were photographed as an ongoing exhibit at the gallery and published as a 100 piece photoset. Performances and actions in Port-au-Prince for the Ghetto Biennale at the end of 2009 preceded the January Haitian earthquake, and the habitual graffito &quot;Imagine Waking Up Tomorrow And All Music Has Disappeared&quot; took on a new resonance in a city with no electricity or infrastructure, rendered suddenly -relatively – musicless. Local artist Claudel Casseus wrote an account of this for Drummond during the reconstruction published as a book &quot;Imajine&quot; (Penkiln Burn 14, 2011), and Drummond&#x27;s own feelings on the residency and the 17 actions, Haiti and the earthquake form four of the interview questions in Drummond&#x27;s &quot;100&quot; project originally posed by Radio 4. 

The 17 is the subject of the 2008 book &quot;17&quot; published by Beautiful Books/PB (Penkiln Burn 12, 2008). This was preceded by a small book &quot;SCORES 18–76&quot; (Penkiln Burn 11, 2006) featuring the second batch of works by The 17, developed in actions in schools in the North East of England, in May 2006, Performances, scores, tours and Drummond&#x27;s related graffiti are documented on a website: the17.org.

In 2012 Drummond had a residency in Sheffield at Site Gallery, and the 17 were convened at sites around the city, the actions performed here are recounted in the book &quot;Ragworts&quot; (Penkiln Burn 18, 2012) and led to the instigation of the annual &quot;Ragwort Week&quot;. The book was published in an edition of 1000 copies, and 100 copies are made available each year and sold only during &quot;Ragwort Week&quot;. 

A performance of The 17&#x27;s SURROUND, originally planned to take place in Damascus, Syria, took place in London on 18 March 2012. Drummond explains in his essay for Treuchet Magazine: &#x27;it would best for all concerned if the Syrian leg of the tri-nation festival was postponed for a few weeks or maybe months, when things would have undoubtedly settled down&#x27;.

=== The Atlantic Archipelago ===

Between 8–19 April 2012 saw a series of Drummond actions and invocations of The17 in a performance titled &quot;The Atlantic Archipelago&quot;. This was to mark the conclusion of the 17 project, or at least its curation by Drummond. It began with a performance of Man Bangs a Drum – which would become a staple of his later 25 Paintings tour – on Skegness beach, before heading west along a straight line drawn across a map crossing Matthew St in Liverpool, and ending in Inshmore in Ireland. The17 were summoned at various locations along this line and the preparations for these performances were filmed by director Stefan Schwietert for a film &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, and documented by photographer Tracey Moberly for a book of the same name.

On 28 April 2013, the day before his 60th birthday, Drummond took part in what has been billed as the last performance of The17. A seventeen-hour version of Score 1: IMAGINE was performed while standing on a manhole cover at the bottom of Mathew Street in Liverpool.

Between 3 and 8 July – Drummond screened a film of his Atlantic Archipelago project, &quot;Imagine Waking Up Tomorrow And All Music Has Disappeared&quot; along the same 53.1256 degree line of latitude the original performances had been undertaken. Beginning at the home of film and gender theorist Ellen Wright, in Louth, Lincolnshire, with a version of The17 which include musicians Robert Wyatt, Hell Uberend and Dave Formula. before moving on to a dawn screening on Skegness beach, through the various locations featured in the film, taking in The Galway Film Fleadh (the only paid ticketed event on the tour), culminating in a sunset screening at Dún Aonghasa on the west coast of Ireland.

Between dawn on Monday the 4th of July to sunset on Friday 8 July, Bill Drummond will be screening the film at numerous locations along the latitude ofs North.

=== The 25 Paintings World Tour: 2014–2025 ===
In February 2014, Drummond announced plans for a world tour, beginning under Spaghetti Junction in Birmingham on 13 March 2014 and ending at the same place on 28 April 2025. Taking in twelve cities in twelve different countries, each leg of the tour will last three months, during which he will produce 25 paintings whilst working on other art projects.

A book &quot;The 25 Paintings&quot; (Penkiln Burn 19; 2014) featured the paintings themselves in their initial states – to be repainted in different cities of the tour, each describing the different art actions that would for his practice during the following years – some new, some well established – and which would replace the 17 in his repertoire. Other paintings and actions are expected to evolve as the tour progresses and the canvasses are reworked.

So far the 25 Paintings Tour has travelled to:
2014: Birmingham, UK
2015: Belgrade, Serbia
2016: Kolkata, India
2018: Lexington, North Carolina, USA
and will conclude in
2027: Damascus, Syria

=== Best Before Death / White Saviour Complex ===
A film &quot;Best Before Death&quot; covering the actions (jobs) &quot;Bang Drum&quot;, &quot;Man Made Bed&quot;, &quot;Make Soup&quot; and &quot;Man Shines Shoes&quot; during the 2016 Kolkata, India and 2018 Lexington, North Carolina, legs of the world tour was made by Paul Duane, Robbie Ryan (Kolkata) and Patrick Jordan (Lexington). The finished film had difficulties gaining distribution and festival screenings as it was criticised as being an example of White Saviour Complex. 
Drummond wrote a play in his Tenzig Scott Brown persona called &quot;White Saviour Complex&quot; consisting of three acts, two of which formed a dialogue between Drummond as Brown, and the actor Tam Dean Burn playing Drummond, Duane&#x27;s film formed the second act, and this toured the UK and its script became a book (Penkiln Burn 22, 2019). 
The DVD Release of &quot;Best Before Death&quot; (Anti-Worlds, 2019) featured a booklet with a piece written by Drummond called &quot;Best Before death&quot; and featuring the script for an imaginary film by Tenzing Scott Brown called &quot;Bad Wisdom&quot;.

==Reviews, accolades and criticism==
In 1993, &quot;Select&quot; magazine published a list of the 100 Coolest People in Pop. Drummond was number one on the list. &quot;What has this giant of coolness not achieved?&quot;, they asked: &quot;Like the Monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Drummond has always been a step ahead of human evolution, guiding us on. Manager of The Teardrop Explodes, co-inventor of ambient and trance house, number one pop star, situationist pagan, folk troubadour, pan-dimensional zenarchist gentleman of leisure...and then, ladies and gentlemen, he THROWS IT ALL AWAY, machine-guns the audience and dumps a dead sheep on the doorstep of the Brit Awards and vanishes to build dry-stone walls. His new &#x27;band&#x27; The K Foundation make records but say they won&#x27;t release them at all until world peace is established. Deranged, inspired, intensely cool.&quot;

Also in 1993, an &quot;NME&quot; piece about the K Foundation found much to praise in Drummond&#x27;s career, from Zoo Records through to the K Foundation art award: &quot;Bill Drummond&#x27;s career is like no other... there&#x27;s been cynicism... and there&#x27;s been care (no one who didn&#x27;t love pop music could have made a record so commercial and so Pet Shop Boys-lovely as &#x27;Kylie Said to Jason&#x27;, or the madly wonderful &#x27;Last Train to Trancentral&#x27;, or the Tammy Wynette version of &#x27;Justified and Ancient&#x27;). There&#x27;s been mysticism... But most of all there&#x27;s been a belief that, both in music and life, there&#x27;s something more.&quot;

Charles Shaar Murray wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that &quot;[Bill] Drummond is many things, and one of those things is a magician. Many of his schemes... involve symbolically-weighted acts conducted away from the public gaze and documented only by Drummond himself and his participating comrades. Nevertheless, they are intended to have an effect on a worldful of people unaware that the act in question has taken place. That is magical thinking. Art is magic, and so is pop. Bill Drummond is a cultural magician...&quot;

In 2001, NME readers voted &quot;the KLF&#x27;s Art Terrorism&quot; at the Brit Awards in 1992 at number 4 in the &quot;top 100 Rock moments of all time.&quot; NME also ranked Drummond as number 17 in its 20 &quot;Greatest Cult Heroes&quot; in 2010.

Art Review&#x27;s artworld &quot;Power 100&quot; listed Drummond as number 98 in 2003.

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; has referred to Drummond as a &quot;high-concept joker&quot;.

In 2006, Drummond&#x27;s book &quot;45&quot; was ranked 21 in the Observer&#x27;s list of &quot;The 50 greatest music books ever&quot;. Kitty Empire of the Guardian included &quot;45&quot; in her list of &quot;10 best music memoirs&quot;. in 2010. &quot;45&quot; also featured in a 2010 book list compiled by Belle &amp; Sebastian.

BBC Radio 1 in 2006 included Drummond in a survey of &quot;Most Punk Persons&quot;. Virgin Media ranked Drummond at number 8 in a list of &quot;Most Eccentric Musicians&quot;.

Julian Cope said in 2000, &quot;I have no relationship with this guy. He burned a million pounds which was not all his, and some of it was mine. People should pay off their creditors before they pull intellectual dry-wank stunts like that.&quot;

Drummond&#x27;s 1986 solo album &quot;The Man&quot; is among Uncut Magazine&#x27;s 2010 list of &quot;Greatest Lost Albums&quot;.
