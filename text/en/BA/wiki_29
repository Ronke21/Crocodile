<text>Rottnest Island (), often colloquially referred to as &quot;Rotto&quot;, is a island off the coast of Western Australia, located west of Fremantle. A sandy, low-lying island formed on a base of aeolianite limestone, Rottnest is an A-class reserve, the highest level of protection afforded to public land.

Together with Garden Island, Rottnest Island is a remnant of Pleistocene dune ridges. Along with several other islands, Rottnest became separated from the mainland around 7,000 years ago, when sea levels rose; the traditional Noongar name for the island is &quot;Wadjemup&quot;, which means &#x27;place across the water where the spirits are&#x27;. Human artefacts have been found on the island dating back at least 30,000 years, but visitation and habitation of the island by the Noongar people appears to have ceased following its separation from the mainland.

The island was first documented by Willem de Vlamingh in 1696, who called it &quot;&#x27;t Eylandt &#x27;t Rottenest&quot; (&quot;Rats&#x27; Nest Island&quot;) after the quokka population. Following establishment of the Swan River Colony (now Perth) in 1829, the island was initially used by British settlers for agricultural purposes, and a permanent settlement was built in Thomson Bay. From 1838 to 1931, Rottnest Island was also used as a prison and forced labour camp for over 3,600 Aboriginal people, who were subjected to extremely harsh conditions on the island. 

Other historical uses of the island include as a military site, and for internment camps housing enemy aliens. Many of the island&#x27;s buildings date from the colonial period, often made from locally quarried limestone, and are now used as accommodation for holidays.

Rottnest is an unincorporated area with no local government, subject to direct administration by the government of Western Australia. It is administered by the state&#x27;s Rottnest Island Authority, which on 1 July 2017 became part of the newly created Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. Rottnest is well known for its population of quokkas, and is also home to colonies of Australian sea lions and southern fur seals, as well as various birds and three native tree species, notably the Rottnest Island pine. 

The island is a popular recreational and tourist destination, with daily ferry services from Perth, the state&#x27;s capital and largest city. It has a permanent population of around 300 people, with around 780,000 annual visitors.

==History==
===Pre-European history===
The land that is now Rottnest Island was inhabited by Noongar people until rising sea levels separated it from the mainland of Western Australia about 7,000 years ago. The island features in Noongar story lines as Wadjemup. Aboriginal artefacts on the island have been dated from 6,500 to more than 30,000 years ago. However, other evidence suggests human occupation significantly before 50,000, possibly as early as 70,000 BP.

No evidence has been found that the Whadjuk Noongar people continued to inhabit or visit the island after its separation from the mainland, and by the time of European exploration in the 1600s, the island is thought to have been unoccupied for thousands of years.

===European exploration and settlement===
The island was observed and explored by various Dutch, French and English maritime expeditions from around 1619 onward, including by Frederick de Houtman around 28 July 1619.

The first Europeans known to have landed on Rottnest Island were about 14 sailors from a Dutch expedition, including Abraham Leeman van Santwits from &quot;Waeckende Boey&quot;, who landed near Bathurst Point on 19 March 1658 while their ship was careened nearby. &quot;Waeckende Boey&quot; (under command of Samuel Volkersen) had been searching for survivors of &quot;Vergulde Draeck&quot;, which had been wrecked off the western coast of Australia in April 1656.Volkersen described the island in his journal:

In his 1681 chart, English captain John Daniel marked an island as &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Isle&quot;, possibly referring to Rottnest. The name did not survive, however.

The island was given the name &quot;&#x27;t Eylandt &#x27;t Rottenest&quot; (&#x27;Rats&#x27; Nest Island&#x27;; the quokkas were mistaken for large rats) by Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh, who spent six days exploring the island from 29 December 1696. De Vlamingh led a fleet of three ships, &quot;De Geelvink&quot;, &quot;De Nijptang&quot; and &quot;Weseltje&quot;, searching for the survivors of &quot;Ridderschap van Holland&quot; that had gone missing two years earlier, and anchored on the northern side of the island, near the Basin. He described the island as &quot;...pleasurable above all islands I have ever seen—a paradise on earth&quot;. During their time on the island, they found no people. Holes were dug on the island, yielding water of good drinking quality. They also noted that the wood from the trees on the island had an exquisite scent—akin to rosewood—and a quantity was cut and brought on board the ship.

Other explorers who stopped at the island included members of the French expedition of Nicholas Baudin in &quot;Naturaliste&quot; and &quot;Geographe&quot; in 1801 (when he planted a flag and left a bottle with a letter) and 1803, Phillip Parker King in 1822, and Captain James Stirling in 1827. Early visitors commonly reported that much of the island was heavily wooded, which is not the case today.

In 1831, shortly after the establishment of the British Swan River Colony at nearby Fremantle, William Clarke and Robert Thomson received land grants for town lots and pasture land on the island. Thomson immediately moved to the island with his wife and eight children. He developed pasture land for hay production west of Herschel Lake as well as salt harvesting from the several salt lakes which was then exported to the mainland settlement. Salt was an important commodity before the advent of refrigeration.

===Aboriginal prison and forced labour camp===

Between 1838 and 1931, Aboriginal prisoners held on Rottnest Island were held in deplorable conditions and subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment. Of the approximately 3,600 people imprisoned there at one time or another over the 93 years the prison existed, at least 373 people died and were buried in unmarked graves in at least two areas to the north of the Quod. It is the largest known deaths in custody gravesite in Australia.

Historical records note that the first cemetery, likely adjacent to the European cemetery, became full following an outbreak of influenza in 1883 and that a second was established further away from the prison. The area is now known as the Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground. Although slavery, as legally defined, was never widespread in Western Australia (and, indeed, called blackbirding rather than plain slavery in the pearling industry), the &quot;assignment&quot; system effectively implemented a system of forced labour, and was condemned by Reverend J. B. Gribble and the Anti-Slavery Society. Aboriginal people who refused assignment were sent to Rottnest Island to be &quot;civilised&quot;, and were used in chain gangs to perform hard labour including farming, quarrying and collecting salt. Most of the island&#x27;s historic Settlement—including Government House (Hotel Rottnest), the church, Salt Store, museum, gift shop, original waterfront cottages and The Quod—was built by forced Aboriginal prison labour working under extremely harsh conditions.

Six Aboriginal prisoners were sent to Rottnest Island in August 1838 under the superintendence of Constable Laurence Welch and a small military force: Helia, for murder; Buoyeen, for assault; Molly Dobbin, Tyoocan, Goodap and Cogat, for theft. All six escaped shortly after their arrival by stealing Thomson&#x27;s boat. Helia drowned during the crossing, but the others apparently survived.

The Colonial Secretary, Peter Broun, announced in June 1839 that the island would be converted to &quot;an Establishment for the Aborigines&quot;, and between 1838 and 1931 (except for the period from 1849 to 1855) Rottnest was used as an Aboriginal prison. Henry Vincent, the Gaoler at Fremantle, was put in charge of the establishment. 

On 7 December 1848, there was another escape by Aboriginal prisoners, with eight out of the 10 prisoners then on the island escaping. Those who escaped came from the north and eastward. &quot;The plan of escape, as related by one of themselves, exhibits considerable foresight and sagacity, being not only well conceived, but as well executed&quot;. The Aboriginals burrowed under the sill door until there was room for them to all pass underneath. They all then crept over the roof of Vincent&#x27;s kitchen and proceeded to the salt house, through the window of which they got out a dinghy which was confined there. They then went to the pilot&#x27;s whaleboat moored a short distance offshore, and succeeded in getting to the mainland north of Fremantle. Five of the escapees were retaken by J. Drummond at Toodyay.

A quadrangular building was constructed in 1863–1864 and generally referred to as &quot;the &quot;; it was used for tourist accommodation until 2018, when it was closed after decades of protests by Aboriginal people. There were about twenty prisoners there in 1844; by 1880, there were 170. Vincent retired in 1867 after complaints regarding cruelty to prisoners; he was replaced by William Jackson. In the early 1880s, an influenza epidemic struck, killing about sixty inmates.In 1902, the abolition of the prison was announced. At that time, there were 33 Aboriginal prisoners serving sentences there. However, the prison continued to be used as a forced labour camp for Aboriginal prisoners until 1931.

Some 3,700 Aboriginal men and boys were imprisoned there during the life of the establishment. There may be as many as 369 inmates&#x27; graves on the island; one writer has suggested that 95% of the deaths were from influenza. In 2015—after numerous protests from local Aboriginal people for the Rottnest Island Authority to create a memorial recognising the events, deaths and unmarked graves which lie on Rottnest Island—work begun on the Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground.

Artefacts from this period continue to be identified and recorded. Len Collard describes these artefacts, such as glass and ceramic spearheads, as an important demonstration of transitional cultural engineering through use of traditional methods to modify the new materials of European settlement.

====Executions====
Five Aboriginal prisoners were executed on Rottnest in the late 19th century, all for murder:

* Tampin (16 July 1879): Hanged for the murder of John Moir at Stokes Inlet on 29 March 1877
* Wangabiddi (18 June 1883): Hanged for the murder of Charles Redfern at Minni-Minni on the Gascoyne River in May 1882
* Guerilla (18 June 1883): Hanged for the murder of Anthony Cornish at Fitzroy River on 12 December 1882
* Naracorie (3 August 1883): Hanged for the murder of Charles Brackell at Wandagee on the Minilya River on 31 July 1882
* Calabungamarra (13 June 1888): Hanged for the murder of a Chinese man, Indyco, at Hamersley Range

===Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground===

In 2015 the restoration and recognition of the Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground began. buildings have been removed from the site and pathway constructed around it. Prior to the closure of the tourist camp in 2018, the burial ground was being using as a spot to pitch tents.

===Boys&#x27; reformatory===

A reformatory for boys was opened on 16 May 1881. The reformatory buildings were adjacent to the Quod and included a workshop, a kitchen, two large dormitories, a school room and four small cells. Carpenter John Watson constructed the buildings and became the superintendent for the life of the establishment. Watson taught the boys carpentry, joinery and gardening.

During a severe influenza epidemic in 1883, the colonial surgeon, Alfred Waylen, directed one of the large rooms in the reformatory to be used as a hospital. An estimate of sixty Indigenous deaths for that year was given by eye-witness, Edward Watson. In 1887, the prison superintendent reported one room in the reformatory still being used for sick prisoners, with two rooms used the previous winter, and made an appeal for a new hospital to be built for the Indigenous prisoners.

In May 1898, two boys disappeared, apparently drowned, after escaping from the reformatory and stealing a dinghy.

After 20 years of operation, the facility closed on 21 September 1901 when the remaining 14 inmates were transferred to an industrial school on the mainland.

The reformatory buildings were used as holiday accommodation as part of the Rottnest Lodge until 2022 when they were closed for redevelopment of more recently constructed parts of the site to create new accommodation and tourist facilities.

===Fires===
In 1856, the settlement structures—the two-storey prison / workshop building, stables, barns and piggery were burnt down. Their former locations are identified in the area between the shops in the settlement area. The fire was deliberately lit by the superintendent, Henry Vincent, after two prisoners had escaped into nearby bush. Vincent lit the fire with the intent of flushing the prisoners out of their hiding place. The prevailing winds at the time were blowing away from the buildings; however, the wind changed direction which brought the flames into the settlement. About 50 tons of hay was also destroyed.

Major bushfires occurred in March 1894, January 1910, January 1917, March 1939, February 1949, and a very significant fire which consumed around two-thirds of the island in 1955. Some of these bushfires were caused by European hunting parties and on one occasion almost wiped out the quokka population.

===Pilot service===
In 1846, a pilot service was established under Captain Edward Back. It continued for 56 years until 1903. The pilot&#x27;s and crews quarters were located in at least three of the colonial buildings identified in the colonial buildings of Rottnest Island—buildings 4, 5 and 6.

===Internment camp===
Rottnest was the site of internment camps in both World War I and World War II In World War I, it was mostly used for German and Austrian suspected enemy aliens, and was closed towards the end of the war, due to poor living conditions. The camp was sited near the present-day Caroline Thomson Camping Area.

In World War II, the camp was used exclusively for Italian enemy aliens and was situated near the airstrip. It had capacity for 120 internees.

It was closed about halfway through the war, and its occupants were sent to various other internment and work camps on the mainland.

===Military history===

Also during World War II, two 9.2-inch guns were installed near the middle of the island at Oliver Hill, and two six-inch guns installed at Bickley Point, for defence of the Fremantle port. The location of the island was seen as being important to the defense of the important port of Fremantle, the major base for the Allies in the Indian Ocean, as bombardment of any attacking ships could be made from the island before the ships would come into range of the port.

A light railway was built from the jetty at Kingstown Barracks on Thomson Bay, to transport materiel and munitions to the guns. Captain (later Brigadier) Frank Bertram Hussey (1908–1985) was seconded from the Australian Staff Corps to oversee the construction of this. The military fixtures including the barracks and railway became known as the &quot;Rottnest Island Fortress&quot;. A number of concrete lookouts and bunkers were built around the island also.

Near Wadjemup Lighthouse, a Battery Observation Post (BOP) was built as a lookout to coordinate aiming and firings from the Bickley and Oliver Hill Batteries. A Signals Building, associated with the BOP and a Women&#x27;s Army Barracks, built to house officers and staff who operated the BOP were constructed there also. The latter building is used nowadays for occasional accommodation for University and other scientific research groups working on the island.

After World War II, the guns and infrastructure were decommissioned and parts of the railway removed. The 9.2-inch battery, however, was saved from disposal because the high cost of removing and shipping the guns to the mainland exceeded their value as scrap metal.

In the 1990s, the gun emplacements and railway were extensively reconstructed, and since then a popular tourist activity has included a tour of the guns and the tunnels, with the journey to the battery being made on a purpose-built train from Kingstown Barracks.

===Communications===

Prior to about 1880, communication with the mainland was primarily with semaphore flags and flares. A staffed lookout at Bathurst Point included a signalling station which relayed shipping information between Wadjemup Lighthouse at the centre of the island and Arthur Head at Fremantle.

A heliograph was installed in 1879 at Signal Hill, the small rise overlooking the main settlement in Thomson Bay. A Frenchman by the name of Henri Courderot was the heliograph operator and was paid $10 per year to operate the service once a day weather permitting.

A single circuit submarine communications cable was laid from Cottesloe in 1900, after which the heliograph service was discontinued. This was replaced with a larger cable in 1935.

===Administration===
After Rottnest was proclaimed as an A-class Reserve in 1917, management was vested in the &quot;Rottnest Island Board of Control&quot; which continued until 1956. The first chairman was Hal Colebatch, who served from 13 May 1917 to 23 July 1956. Rottnest Island was declared an A class reserve under the Permanent Reserves Act in May 1917. A Board was then appointed under the Parks and Reserves Act to control and manage the island (excluding the lighthouse and prison reserve). The Board of Control became a Body Corporate in 1956 and became a Board of Management.

Between 24 July 1956 and 29 May 1988, it was changed to the &quot;Board of Management&quot;. Section 3, subsection 4 of the Parks and Reserves Act 1895–1955 provided legislative scope for the Rottnest Island Board of Control became a Body Corporate on 24 July 1956. The Rottnest Island Board of Control became the Rottnest Island Board of Management &quot;with power to sue and be sued in its corporate name, to acquire, hold, lease and dispose of real and personal property, to borrow money with the approval of the Governor and to do and permit to be done all things which are required by the Act to the be done by the Board ...&quot;, until 1988 at which time it became the Rottnest Island Authority. During this time the managing instrumentality was informally and generally referred to as the &quot;Rottnest Island Board&quot; (RIB). In 1988 the &quot;Rottnest Island Authority&quot; commenced operations.

In May 1966, Rottnest Island and Carnac Island were included in the boundaries of the Shire of Cockburn, which became the City of Cockburn in 1971. However, the council has &quot;no involvement in or responsibility for any functions relating to the control and management of the islands&quot;.

On 28 April 2017, the government of Western Australia announced that the Department of Parks and Wildlife would merge with the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, the Zoological Parks Authority and the Rottnest Island Authority on 1 July 2017 to form the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.

Uniquely for Western Australia, the island is classified as a state reserve, the Rottnest Island State Reserve, being the only area in the state with this classification. The reserve extends beyond the island&#x27;s shore and covers .

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
Between March and May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, the island was used as a quarantine station for arriving tourists and returning Australians.

==Flora and fauna==
===Birds===
Many coastal birds are frequently found in Rottnest. These include the pied cormorant, osprey, pied oystercatcher, silver gull, crested tern, fairy tern, bridled tern, rock parrot and the reef heron. The island salt lakes contain brine shrimp which support birds such as the red-necked avocet, banded stilt, ruddy turnstone, curlew sandpiper, red-capped dotterel, Australian shelduck, red-necked stint, grey plover, white-fronted chat, Caspian tern and the crested tern. Several pairs of osprey nest at Rottnest each year; one nest at Salmon Point is estimated to be 70 years old. Introduced peafowl are often seen near the main settlement.

The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports important breeding populations of the fairy terns (200 to 300 breeding pairs), over 1% of the non-breeding population of banded stilts (with up to 20,000 birds) and regionally significant numbers of wedge-tailed shearwaters and red-necked stints.

===Other animals===

Rottnest is one of the few areas in the world where the native quokka can be found. Its survival there is largely due to the exclusion of natural or introduced predators compared to the mainland.

Reptiles include dugite (&quot;Pseudonaja affinis&quot;), the southern blind snake (&quot;Ramphotyphlops australis&quot;), King&#x27;s skink (&quot;Egernia kingii&quot;), bobtail (&quot;Tiliqua rugosa&quot;), marbled gecko (&quot;Christinus marmoratus&quot;), west coast ctenotus (&quot;Ctenotus fallens&quot;) and Burton&#x27;s legless lizard (&quot;Lialis burtonis&quot;). There are three species of frogs: the moaning frog (&quot;Heleioporus eyrei&quot;), the western green tree frog (&quot;Litoria moorei&quot;) and the sign-bearing froglet (&quot;Crinia insignifera&quot;).

With the extensive reefs surrounding the island, many species of fish, crustaceans and coral can be found. Cetaceans such as bottlenose dolphins, and migrating humpbacks, and fewer southern rights, and the Perth Canyon off the island is one of main habitats for blue whales in Australia, for which there are also whale watching expeditions. A colony of Australian sea lions reside at Dyer Island and a colony of New Zealand fur seals (&quot;Arctophoca forsteri&quot;) reside at Cathedral Rocks.

===Feral animals===
Domestic cats were introduced to Rottnest both as pets and as predators of commensal pest animals such as the black rat and house mouse at various times since European settlement. Historically, the Rottnest Island Authority has attempted to rid the island of all cats since the 1960s. It was suggested that cats may be influencing the abundance of native fauna and if left uncontrolled, the cat population was likely to increase and could result in considerable damage to ground-nesting birds and heavy predation pressure on quokkas and reptile species.

A feral cat monitoring and trapping campaign was conducted in November 2001 and 2002. Four cats were trapped and no further cat activity has been observed or cats sighted by Rottnest Island staff or the general public in the eight years subsequent to this program suggesting that eradication has been successfully achieved.

In 2008 the island implemented a pest bird management plan, which targets birds considered to be pest species, including silver gulls, Australian ravens, common (ring-necked) pheasant, galahs, peafowl and rainbow lorikeets. Peafowl were believed to have been released on the island between 1910 and 1915. During the late 1950s, the population reached no more than fifty birds. Only three males (peacocks) were left after the 2009 cull.

===Plants===

The island includes three native woodland tree species, the Rottnest Island pine (&quot;Callitris preissii&quot;), the Rottnest Island teatree (&quot;Melaleuca lanceolata&quot;) and &quot;Acacia rostellifera&quot;. The Rottnest Island daisy (&quot;Trachymene coerulea&quot;) is a commonly occurring flowering native which is also grown widely as an ornamental garden plant. Coastal dune flora include searocket (&quot;Cakile&quot;), beach spinifex (&quot;Spinifex longifolius&quot;) and wild rosemary (&quot;Olearia axillaris&quot;).

A &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; plantation was established by internees during World War I, roughly bordering the main settlement, The Basin and Bathurst. Plantation remnants can be seen around the golf course.

Rottnest was often described as heavily wooded by early explorers. Nearly 200 years of farmland clearing, firewood collection and bushfires has denuded much of the of large trees, and a fragile and fresh water-scarce environment has limited natural recovery. A conservation program including reforestation is ongoing. An island-based nursery propagates plants with island provenance used in the reforestation program and in remediating uncontrolled beach access.

==Geographical features==
==Climate==
Rottnest Island has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;) with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Although the summers get little rain, they are humid.

==Tourism and facilities==

The island became largely devoted to recreational use from the 1900s, aside from a brief period of exclusive military use during World War II. It is now visited annually by 450,000 to 500,000 visitors, an average of 330,000 of those arriving by ferry or air taxi. Seventy per cent of all visitors come for the day only. The majority of visitors arrive in summer, with nearly 20% of all visitors coming in January.
The only motor vehicles permitted on the island are emergency and service vehicles, although there is also a bus service. Cycling is the transport of choice for most visitors, with many either bringing a bicycle with them or hiring one at the island&#x27;s facility.

The main settlement is located at Thomson Bay, which is a protected north-easterly bay facing the mainland. Other settlements are located at Geordie Bay and Longreach Bay on the northern side of the island. All are sheltered bays and well suited for boating and swimming. Many other bays around the island have permanent boat moorings which can be leased from the Rottnest Island Authority. 
The island has accommodation for up to 5,500 visitors, while day-only visitors can number up to 20,000 at any one time. Rottnest Island Authority accommodation options include 291 villas, units and cottages which sleep four, six or eight people and which are self-catering. This style of accommodation is reasonably basic. Demand for accommodation is very high during the summer months. Ballots are no longer held and guests can book up to 18 months in advance.Other accommodation options include the below.
* Group accommodation at Kingstown Barracks.
* The Hotel Rottnest, formerly called the Quokka Arms Hotel and prior to that the Governor&#x27;s residence.
* The Rottnest Lodge.
*Cabins at Caroline Thomson provide an alternative to camping and are popular with families, sleeping up to six with self-contained cooking and washing facilities.

Most visitors arrive on one of the ferries from Fremantle, Perth and Hillarys. These are operated by Rottnest Express, Rottnest Fast Ferries and more recently SeaLink. Rottnest Island Airport for light aircraft is located near the main settlement.

The island was previously popular with Year 12 school leavers celebrating the end of their exams each November—known in Western Australia as &quot;leavers week&quot; or just &quot;leavers&quot;—RIA accommodation on the island was reserved for leavers during this time. Identification and proof of being a current secondary school leaver was required to book accommodation during this period. A decrease in attendance over this period of time has led to leavers week no longer occurring on Rottnest.

Catering facilities in the Thomson Bay foreshore area include a Dôme coffee shop, Thomsons Restaurant; Quokka Joes; Rottnest Lodge and the Hotel Rottnest. The main settlement has a general store, including a liquor outlet, a bakery, cafe/coffee shop, Subway restaurant and clothing store. The Red Rooster store closed in 2011. The Lodge includes several restaurants and bars also. Geordie Bay also has a general store, liquor outlet and Geordie Cafe.

A luxury hotel was planned for the island but negotiations with preferred proponents ceased. The Authority stated that &quot;The development of a new hotel at Mount Herschel remains a priority.&quot;

The island was the site of an important Australian High Court case, &quot;Nagle v Rottnest Island Authority&quot;, which arose after a man dived off a rock on Rottnest Island and became a quadriplegic. It was held that, as the island authority had promoted the site as a venue for swimming and had not put up a warning notice, it was liable for causing the injury.

===Activities===

Diving is a popular activity at Rottnest. Its varied limestone reef terrain and plentiful fish make it an interesting diving destination. In particular, diving for crayfish and Western rock lobster is popular in the summer months. The season opens on 15 November each year and runs until 30 June. Crayfish may be caught in special traps or &quot;pots&quot;, or when diving either by hand or by using a crayfish &quot;loop&quot;. The loop is a spring-loaded steel cable attached to a long pole. It is illegal to use any means that might puncture the shell to catch the crayfish. The bag limit is 6 per licence per day, with a maximum of 12 per boat per day.

Local delicacies western rock lobsters (&quot;Panulirus cygnus)&quot; and sea scallops (Ylistrum balloti) are freshly caught and cooked on Rottnest Cruises &quot;Luxe Island Seafood Cruise&quot; during open season.

A snorkel trail at Parker Point features underwater interpretative plaques that give information about the marine environments surrounding Rottnest. The island is the southernmost point along the Western Australian coastline at which coral grows. The Rottnest Island Wreck Trail was developed in conjunction with the Western Australian Museum in 1980 as the first underwater interpretative trail in the southern hemisphere. Visits to some of the Rottnest Island shipwrecks, in essence a museum-without-walls can be made by glass-bottomed boat, or by scuba and snorkel. The SS &quot;Macedon&quot; site is one of the most visited wrecks in Australia.

The island features historic buildings and pleasant beaches (all reachable via the many cycling tracks; cycling being the island&#x27;s main mode of transport—private or hire cars are not allowed on the island).

===Annual events===
*The Rottnest Channel Swim is a long-distance swimming event from Cottesloe Beach to Rottnest Island. It is held each February.
*The Rottnest Marathon &amp; Fun Run is an annual running event operated late each October by the West Australian Marathon Club. Event distances are , and the marathon distance .
*&quot;Rottofest&quot; is a popular comedy, film and music festival held annually in September.
* Leavers week (November), when high-school graduates visit Rottnest to celebrate the end of their final exams. Although in recent times &#x27;leavers&#x27; no longer occurs due to major falls in popularity.
* &quot;Swim Thru Rottnest&quot; is an annual 1,600-metre swim held on the first Saturday in December. The event was first held in 1977. Competitors start on the east side of the Army Jetty in Thomson Bay, swim to the natural jetty and then return to the Army jetty. The event is run by the Cottesloe Crabs Winter Swimming Club.
* &quot;The Doctor&quot; is a surfski and paddle race from the Army jetty to Sorrento Beach. It is held each January.
* &quot;Fremantle to Rottnest Big Splash&quot; is a masters swimming race from Leighton Beach to Rottnest.

==Transport==

In 2017, a new ferry operator, SeaLink Rottnest Island, commenced services to the island and reduced the ferry costs by 30%.

Other ferry services are provided from Perth and Fremantle by Rottnest Express and Rottnest Fast Ferries from Hillarys Boat Harbour. Ferries take approximately 25 minutes from Fremantle, 45 minutes from Hillarys, or 90 minutes from Perth.

Bus services on the island were previously operated by the Rottnest Island Authority under the Island Explorer brand. In November 2015, Adams Coachlines commenced a 10-year contract to operate all bus services.

Helicopter and light plane flights are also available.

Private cars are not allowed on the island; the most common private transport is by bicycle or walking.

===Oliver Hill Railway===

In 1993, the World War II light railway from the Kingstown Barracks to Oliver Hill Battery was extensively refurbished and turned into the Oliver Hill Railway. A spur line was built to the Settlement and services were opened to the public in 1994.

In November 2003 a new railcar was put into service for this route, named the &quot;Captain Hussey&quot; after Frank Bertram Hussey who oversaw the construction of the original railway. The railcar was built with volunteer assistance, and cost $171,500.

In 2019, Arc Infrastructure undertook a major refurbishment of the railway valued at over $300,000, including the installation of 1,200 new sleepers.

==Services==

Rottnest Island has few permanent residents, with most island workers commuting from the mainland.

As Rottnest is isolated from the mainland, and has no fresh surface water, providing water, power and waste disposal has always been difficult and expensive. In 1996, Rottnest introduced the first public-place recycling program in Western Australia. In 2000, the island won the 3R awards (reduce, reuse and recycle). A daily supply barge (the &quot;Spinifex&quot;) makes a return trip from Fremantle, delivering supplies and removing rubbish.

For many years during the twentieth century, the water supply was rainwater harvested from several large bitumen-sealed catchment areas behind Longreach Bay. In the 1970s, fresh water was found underground and was used to supplement the rainfall supply. In 1995, the supply was further supplemented with desalinated groundwater, using a reverse osmosis plant producing up to per day.

Experimental wind turbines were commissioned in 1978; however, high maintenance requirements and excessive power generation resulted in diesel fuel remaining the main power source. In 2004, a new wind-diesel system was erected; other works at the time included upgrades to the power station and the installation of low load diesel generators. The wind turbine delivers approximately 37% of Rottnest&#x27;s power requirements and saves over of diesel fuel per year.

Two fully automated lighthouses operate on the island to aid passing maritime traffic: Bathurst Lighthouse and Wadjemup Lighthouse. An extensive network of flashing markers and transit beacons indicate safe passages through the rocky entrances to bays.

== Volunteer groups working on Rottnest ==
Volunteering has been a part of the culture on Rottnest Island since the Winnit Club began working there in the summer of 1930–1931. Other volunteer organisations have included the Rottnest Island Foundation, the Rottnest Society, and the Rottnest Voluntary Guides Association. Tasks vary, including guided tours, tree planting, litter collection, and the building of access boardwalks and stairs.

The RIA employs a full-time volunteer coordinator. Rottnest Island Volunteer Fire and Rescue Services, this brigade is a &quot;private brigade&quot; where the RIA funds critical funding to allow the brigade to function. The brigade is trained to be first response to any emergency on the island, assisted by agencies on and off the island. Most of the members are working residents in volunteering roles.

==Popular culture==
* A 1912 film, &quot;Trip to Rottnest&quot;, made by the Australian Government to popularise Rottnest as a holiday destination, is thought to be one of the first of its kind.

<text>Annie Winifred Ellerman (2 September 1894 – 28 January 1983), known by the pen name Bryher, was an English novelist, poet, memoirist, and magazine editor of the Ellerman ship-owning family.

She was a major figure of the international set in Paris in the 1920s, using her fortune to help many struggling writers. With her lover H.D. and the Scottish writer Kenneth Macpherson, she launched the film magazine &quot;Close Up&quot;, which introduced Sergei Eisenstein’s work to British viewers. From her home in Switzerland, she helped to evacuate Jews from Nazi Germany, and then became a popular historical novelist.

== Early life ==
Bryher was born in September 1894 in Margate. Her father was the shipowner and financier John Ellerman, who at the time of his death in 1933 was the richest Englishman who had ever lived. He lived with her mother Hannah Glover, but did not marry her until 1908.

Bryher traveled in Europe as a child, to France, Italy, Egypt, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, North Africa and Greece. At the age of fourteen she was enrolled at Queenwood Ladies&#x27; College and at around this time her mother and father married. On one of her travels, Ellerman journeyed to the Isles of Scilly off the southwestern coast of Great Britain and acquired her future pseudonym from her favourite island, Bryher.

During the 1920s, Bryher was an unconventional figure in Paris. Among her circle of friends were Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Sylvia Beach and Berenice Abbott. Her wealth enabled her to give financial support to struggling writers, including Joyce and Edith Sitwell. She also helped with finance for Sylvia Beach&#x27;s bookshop Shakespeare and Company and certain publishing ventures, and started a film company Pool Group. She also helped provide funds to purchase a flat in Paris for the destitute Dada artist and writer Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven.

== Relationship and later life ==

Bryher knew from an early age that she was lesbian. In 1918 she met and became involved in a relationship with American poet Hilda Doolittle, better known by her initials, H.D. The relationship was open, and both had other partners. In 1921 she entered into a marriage of convenience with the American author Robert McAlmon, whom she divorced in 1927.

That same year she married Kenneth Macpherson, a writer who shared her interest in film and who was at the same time H.D.&#x27;s lover. In Burier, Switzerland, overlooking Lake Geneva, the couple built a Bauhaus-style structure that doubled as a home and film studio, which they named Kenwin. They formally adopted H.D.&#x27;s young daughter, Perdita. In 1928, H.D. became pregnant with Macpherson&#x27;s child, but chose to abort the pregnancy. Bryher divorced MacPherson in 1947; she and Doolittle no longer lived together after 1946, but continued their relationship until Doolittle&#x27;s death in 1961.

==Filmmaking and film criticism==
Bryher, H.D., and Macpherson formed the film magazine &quot;Close Up&quot;, and the Pool Group. Only one &quot;POOL&quot; film, &quot;Borderline&quot; (1930), starring H.D. and Paul Robeson, survives in its entirety. In common with the &quot;Borderline&quot; novellas, it explores extreme psychic states and their relationship to surface reality. Bryher herself plays an innkeeper.

Bryher&#x27;s most notable non-fiction work was &quot;Film Problems of Soviet Russia&quot; (1929). In &quot;Close Up&quot; she compared Hollywood cinema unfavorably with Soviet cinema, arguing that the studio system had &quot;lowered the standards&quot; of cinema. Her writings also helped to bring Sergei Eisenstein to the attention of the British public.

== World War II and after ==
In a 1933 article in &quot;Close up&quot; entitled &quot;What Shall You Do in the War?&quot;, Bryher wrote about the situation of Jews in Nazi Germany, urging readers to take action. Starting that year, her home in Switzerland became a &quot;receiving station&quot; for refugees; she helped more than 100 people escape Nazi persecution before she began to fear for her own safety and returned to the UK. This experience influenced her 1965 science fantasy novel &quot;Visa for Avalon&quot;, about a group of people trying to escape an unnamed country for a place called Avalon on the eve of revolution.

From 1940 to 1946 she lived in London with H.D. and supervised the literary magazine &quot;Life and Letters To-day&quot;. She later wrote a memoir of these years entitled &quot;The Days of Mars&quot;, as well as a novel, &quot;Beowulf&quot; (1948), set during the Blitz.

Starting in 1952, she wrote a series of historical novels. Most are set in Britain during various eras; &quot;Roman Wall&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Coin of Carthage&quot; (1963) are set in the Roman Empire; &quot;Ruan&quot; (1960) is set in a post-Arthurian Britain. They are well researched and vivid, typically set in times of turmoil and often seen from the perspective of a young man. &quot;The Fourteenth of October&quot; (1952) focuses on a young boy, Wulf, caught up in the Battle of Hastings. &quot;The Player&#x27;s Boy&quot; (1953) is centred on James Sands, a youthful apprentice actor in the Elizabethan theatre. &quot;Ruan&quot; portrays the adventures of a Druid Novice who yearns to escape the confines of his surroundings and upbringing to become a sea captain. Rosemary Sutcliff, who admired Bryher&#x27;s work, reprinted &quot;The Player&#x27;s Boy&quot; in her series, the &quot;Hodder and Stoughton Library of Great Historical Novels&quot;.

Acclaimed in her own time, her historical novels have now fallen out of print, but used copies are readily available. Since 2000, &quot;Visa for Avalon&quot;, her early semi-autobiographical novels &quot;Development&quot; and &quot;Two Selves&quot;, her memoir &quot;The Heart to Artemis&quot;, and her historical novel &quot;The Player&#x27;s Boy&quot; have been republished.

<text>The Second French Empire, officially the French Empire, was the government of France from 1852 to 1870. It was established on 2 December 1852 by Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, president of France under the French Second Republic, who proclaimed himself Emperor of the French as Napoleon III. The period was one of significant achievements in infrastructure and economy, while France reasserted itself as the dominant power in Europe. 

Historians in the 1930s and 1940s disparaged the Second Empire as a precursor of fascism, but by the late 20th century it was re-evaluated as an example of a modernizing regime. Historians have generally given the Second Empire negative evaluations on its foreign policy, and somewhat more positive assessments of domestic policies, especially after Napoleon III liberalised his rule after 1858. He promoted French business and exports. The greatest achievements included a railway network that facilitated commerce and tied the nation together with Paris as its hub. This stimulated economic growth and brought prosperity to most regions of the country. The Second Empire is credited with renovating Paris with broad boulevards, striking public buildings, and elegant residential districts for wealthier Parisians.

Internationally, Napoleon III tried to emulate his uncle Napoleon Bonaparte, engaging in numerous imperial ventures around the world as well as several wars in Europe. He began his reign with French victories in Crimea and in Italy, gaining Savoy and Nice, and very briefly, Venetia (before in turn ceding to Italy). Using very harsh methods, he built up the French Empire in North Africa, in East Africa and in French Indochina. Napoleon III also launched an intervention in Mexico seeking to erect the Second Mexican Empire and bring it into the French orbit, but this ended in a fiasco. He mishandled the Prussian threat, and by the end of his reign, the French emperor found himself without allies in the face of overwhelming German forces. The Second Empire came to an end during the Franco-Prussian War, following Napoleon III&#x27;s capture at the Battle of Sedan and the proclamation of the Third French Republic on 4 September 1870.

==History==

===Coup of 1851===
On 2 December 1851, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, who had been elected President of the Republic in 1848, staged a coup d&#x27;état by dissolving the National Assembly without having the constitutional right to do so. He thus became sole ruler of France, and re-established universal suffrage, previously abolished by the Assembly. His decisions were popularly endorsed by a referendum later that month that attracted 92 percent support.

At that same referendum, a new constitution was approved. Formally enacted in January 1852, the new document made Louis-Napoléon president for 10 years, with no restrictions on re-election. It concentrated virtually all governing power in his hands. However, Louis-Napoléon was not content with merely being an authoritarian president. Almost as soon as he signed the new document into law, he set about restoring the empire. In response to officially inspired requests for the return of the empire, the Senate scheduled a second referendum in November, which passed with 97 percent support. As with the December 1851 referendum, most of the &quot;yes&quot; votes were manufactured out of thin air.

The empire was formally re-established on 2 December 1852, and the Prince-President became &quot;Napoléon III, Emperor of the French&quot;. The constitution had already concentrated so much power in his hands that the only substantive changes were to replace the word &quot;president&quot; with the word &quot;emperor&quot; and to make the post hereditary. The popular referendum became a distinct sign of Bonapartism, which Charles de Gaulle would later use.

===Early reign===
With dictatorial powers, Napoleon III made building a good railway system a high priority. He consolidated three dozen small, incomplete lines into six major companies using Paris as a hub. Paris grew dramatically in terms of population, industry, finance, commercial activity and tourism. Working with Georges-Eugène Haussmann, Napoleon spent lavishly to rebuild the city into a world-class showpiece. The financial soundness for all six companies was solidified by government guarantees. Although France had started late, by 1870 it had an excellent railway system, supported as well by good roads, canals and ports.

Napoleon, in order to restore the prestige of the Empire before the newly awakened hostility of public opinion, tried to gain the support from the Left that he had lost from the Right. After the return from Italy, the general amnesty of 16 August 1859 had marked the evolution of the absolutist or authoritarian empire towards the liberal, and later parliamentary empire, which was to last for ten years.

===Religion===
The idea of Italian unification, which would inevitably end the temporal power of the popes, outraged French Catholics, who had been the leading supporters of the Empire. A keen Catholic opposition sprang up, voiced in Louis Veuillot&#x27;s paper the &quot;Univers&quot;, and was not silenced even by the Syrian expedition (1860) in favour of the Catholic Maronite side of the Druze–Maronite conflict.

Ultramontane Catholicism, longing for close links to the Pope in Rome, played a pivotal role in the democratisation of culture. The pamphlet campaign led by Mgr Gaston de Ségur, at the height of the Italian question in February 1860, made the most of the freedom of expression enjoyed by the Catholic Church in France. The goal was to mobilise Catholic opinion and encourage the government to support the Pope. A major result of the Catholic ultramontane campaign was to trigger reforms in the cultural sphere, which also granted freedoms to their political enemies the Republicans and freethinkers.

Although the Second Empire strongly favoured Catholicism, the official state religion, it tolerated Protestants and Jews, with no persecutions or pogroms. The state dealt with the small Protestant community of Calvinist and Lutheran churches, whose members included many prominent businessmen who supported the regime. The emperor&#x27;s Decree Law of 26 March 1852 led to greater government interference in Protestant church affairs, thus reducing self-regulation in favor of Catholic bureaucrats who misunderstood and mistrusted Protestant doctrine. Their administration affected not only church-state relations but also the internal lives of Protestant communities.

===Police===
Napoleon III manipulated a range of politicised police powers to censor the media and suppress opposition. Legally he had broad powers but in practice he was limited by legal, customary and moral deterrents. By 1851 political police had a centralised administrative hierarchy and were largely immune from public control. The Second Empire continued the system; proposed innovations were stalled by officials. Typically political roles were part of routine administrative duties. Although police forces were indeed strengthened, opponents exaggerated the increase of secret police activity and the imperial police lacked the omnipotence seen in later totalitarian states.

===Freedom of the press===
Napoleon began by removing the gag which was keeping the country in silence. On 24 November 1860, he granted to the Chambers the right to vote an address annually in answer to the speech from the throne, and to the press the right of reporting parliamentary debates. He counted on the latter concession to hold in check the growing Catholic opposition, which was becoming more and more alarmed by the policy of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; practiced by the emperor in Italy. The government majority already showed some signs of independence. The right of voting on the budget by sections, granted by the emperor in 1861, was a new weapon given to his adversaries. Everything conspired in their favour: the anxiety of those candid friends who were calling attention to the defective budget, the commercial crisis and foreign troubles.

===The &quot;Union libérale&quot;===

Napoleon again disappointed the hopes of Italy, allowed Poland to be crushed, and allowed Prussia to triumph over Denmark regarding the Schleswig-Holstein question. These inconsistencies led opposition leaders to form the &quot;Union libérale&quot;, a coalition of the Legitimist, Liberal and Republican parties. The Opposition gained forty seats in the elections of May–June 1863, and Adolphe Thiers urgently gave voice to the opposition parties&#x27; demands for &quot;necessary liberties&quot;.

It would have been difficult for the emperor to mistake the importance of this manifestation of French opinion, and in view of his international failures, impossible to repress it. The sacrifice of minister Persigny of the interior, who was responsible for the elections, the substitution for the ministers without portfolio of a sort of presidency of the council filled by Eugène Rouher, the &quot;Vice-Emperor&quot;, and the nomination of Jean Victor Duruy, an anti-clerical, as minister of public instruction, in reply to those attacks of the Church which were to culminate in the Syllabus of 1864, all indicated a distinct &quot;rapprochement&quot; between the emperor and the Left.

But though the opposition represented by Thiers was rather constitutional than dynastic, there was another and irreconcilable opposition, that of the amnestied or voluntarily exiled republicans, of whom Victor Hugo was the eloquent mouthpiece. Thus those who had formerly constituted the governing classes were again showing signs of their ambition to govern. There appeared to be some risk that this movement among the bourgeoisie might spread to the people. Napoleon believed that he would consolidate his menaced power by again turning to the labouring masses, by whom that power had been established.

Assured of support, the emperor, through Rouher, a supporter of the absolutist &quot;régime&quot;, refused all fresh claims on the part of the Liberals. He was aided by international events such as the reopening of cotton supplies when the American Civil War ended in 1865, by the apparent closing of the Roman question by the convention of 15 September, which guaranteed to the Papal States the protection of Italy, and finally by the treaty of 30 October 1864, which temporarily put an end to the Second Schleswig War.

===Social mobility===
France was primarily a rural society, in which social class depended on family reputation and land ownership. A limited amount of upward mobility was feasible through the steadily improving educational system. Students from all levels of society were granted admission to public secondary schools, opening a ladder to sons of peasants and artisans. However, whether through jealousy of or distrust for the higher classes, few working-class families took advantage of education or wished to see their sons move up and out: very few sought admission to the &#x27;grandes écoles.&#x27; The elite maintained their position while allowing social ascent through the professions for ambitious sons of wealthy farmers and small-town merchants.

===Mobilisation of the working classes===
The ultramontane party grumbled, while the industries formerly protected were dissatisfied with free trade reform. The working classes had abandoned their political neutrality. Disregarding Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&#x27;s impassioned attack on communism, they had gradually been won over by the collectivist theories of Karl Marx and the revolutionary theories of Mikhail Bakunin, as set forth at the congresses of the International. These labour congresses defied official proscriptions, and proclaimed that the social emancipation of the worker was inseparable from his political emancipation. The union between the internationalists and the republican bourgeois became an accomplished fact.

The Empire, taken by surprise, sought to curb both the middle classes and the labourers, goading both into revolutionary actions. There were multiple strikes. The elections of May 1869, which took place during these disturbances, inflicted upon the Empire a serious moral defeat. In spite of the government&#x27;s warning against the &quot;red terror&quot;, the conciliatory candidate Ollivier was rejected by Paris, while 40 irreconcilables and 116 members of the Third Party were elected. Concessions had to be made, and by the &quot;senatus-consulte&quot; of 8 September 1869, a parliamentary monarchy was substituted for the Emperor&#x27;s personal government. On 2 January 1870 Ollivier was placed at the head of the first homogeneous, united and responsible ministry.

===Plebiscite of 1870===
Although most of the country hailed this reconciliation of liberty and order, the republican party insisted on further reforms and liberties and demanding the overthrow of the Empire. The killing of the journalist Victor Noir by Pierre Bonaparte, a member of the imperial family, gave the revolutionaries their long desired opportunity (10 January). But the &quot;émeute&quot; (uprising) ended in a failure.

In a concession to democratic currents, the emperor put his policy to a plebiscite on 8 May 1870. The result was a substantial success for Bonaparte, with seven and a half million in favour and only one and a half million against. However, the vote also signified divisions in France. Those affirming were found mainly in rural areas, while the opposition prevailed in the big towns.

==Foreign policy==
The Crimean War ended in 1856, a victory for Napoleon III and a resulting peace that excluded Russia from the Black Sea. His son Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte was born the same year, which promised a continuation of the dynasty.

In 1859, Napoleon led France to war with Austria over Italy. France was victorious and gained Savoy and Nice.

The commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1860 ratified the free trade policy of Richard Cobden and Michel Chevalier, had brought upon French industry the sudden shock of foreign competition. Thus both Catholics and protectionists discovered that authoritarian rule could be favourable when it served their ambitions or interests, but not when exercised at their expense.

France was officially neutral throughout the American Civil War, 1861–1865 and never recognised the Confederate States of America. The Union warned that recognition would mean war. However, the textile industry needed Southern cotton, and Napoleon had imperial ambitions in Mexico, which could be greatly aided by the Confederacy. At the same time, other French political leaders, such as Foreign Minister Édouard Thouvenel, supported the United States. Napoleon helped finance the Confederacy but refused to intervene actively until Britain agreed, and London always rejected intervention. The Emperor realised that a war with the US without allies would spell disaster for France.

Napoleon dreamed of building a French economic sphere in Latin America, centered on Mexico. He helped to promote rapid economic modernisation, but his army battled diehard insurgents who had American support. By 1863, French military intervention in Mexico to set up a Second Mexican Empire headed by Emperor Maximilian, brother of Franz Joseph I of Austria, was a complete fiasco. The Mexicans fought back and after defeating the Confederacy the U.S. demanded the French withdraw from Mexico—sending 50,000 veteran combat troops to the border to ram the point home. The French army went home; the puppet emperor did not leave and was executed.

From 1861 to 1863 France embarked on colonising experiments in Cochinchina (southern Vietnam) and Annam (central Vietnam). The conquest was bloody but successful, and supported by large numbers of French soldiers, missionaries and businessmen, as well as the local Chinese entrepreneurial element.

Mixed domestic gains and losses resulted from European policies. The support France gave to the Italian cause had aroused the eager hopes of other nations. The proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861 after the rapid annexation of Central Italy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had proved the danger of half-measures. But when a concession, however narrow, had been made to the liberty of one nation, it could hardly be refused to the no less legitimate aspirations of the rest.

In 1863, these &quot;new rights&quot; again clamoured loudly for recognition: in Poland, in Schleswig and Holstein, in Italy, now united, with neither frontiers nor capital, and in the Danubian principalities. To extricate himself from the Polish &quot;impasse&quot;, the emperor again proposed a congress, with no luck. He was again unsuccessful: Great Britain refused even to admit the principle of a congress, while Austria, Prussia and Russia gave their adhesion only on conditions which rendered it futile, i.e. they reserved the vital questions of Venetia and Poland. The Emperor&#x27;s support of the Polish rebels alienated the Russian leadership. The visit of Tsar Alexander II of Russia to Paris ended in near-disaster when he was twice attacked by Polish assassins, but escaped. In Berlin, Otto von Bismarck saw the opportunity to squeeze out the French by forming closer relationships with the Russians.

The success of the 1870 plebiscite, which should have consolidated the Empire, determined its downfall. It was thought that a diplomatic success would make the country forget liberty in favour of glory. It was in vain that after the parliamentary revolution of 2 January 1870, Comte Daru revived, through Lord Clarendon, Count Beust&#x27;s plan of disarmament after the Battle of Königgrätz. He met with a refusal from Prussia and from the imperial entourage. The Empress Eugénie was credited with the remark, &quot;If there is no war, my son will never be emperor.&quot;

===Overseas empire===

Napoleon III doubled the area of the French overseas Empire; he established French rule in New Caledonia, and Cochinchina, established a protectorate in Cambodia (1863); and colonised parts of Africa. He joined Britain in sending an army to China during the Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion (1860), but French ventures failed to establish influence in Japan (1867) and Korea (1866).

To carry out his new overseas projects, Napoleon III created a new Ministry of the Navy and the Colonies, and appointed an energetic minister, Prosper, Marquis of Chasseloup-Laubat, to head it. A key part of the enterprise was the modernisation of the French Navy; he began the construction of fifteen powerful screw steamers; and a fleet of steam powered troop transports. The French Navy became the second most powerful in the world, after Britain&#x27;s. He also created a new force of colonial troops, including elite units of naval infantry, Zouaves, the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique, and Algerian sharpshooters, and he expanded the Foreign Legion, which had been founded in 1831 and fought well in the Crimea, Italy and Mexico. French overseas territories had tripled in area; in 1870 they covered almost a million square kilometres, and controlled nearly five million inhabitants. While soldiers, administrators, businessmen and missionaries came and left, very few Frenchmen permanently settled in the colonies, except in Algeria. The colonial trade reached 600 million francs, but the profits were overwhelmed by the expenses. However, a major goal was the &#x27;Mission civilisatrice&#x27;, the mission to spread French culture, language and religion, and this proved successful.

==Downfall==

The rise of the neighbouring state of Prussia during the 1860s threatened French supremacy in western Europe. Napoleon, growing steadily weaker in body and mind, badly mishandled the situation, and eventually found himself in a war without allies. Britain was afraid of French militarism and refused to help. Russia was highly annoyed about French interference in supporting Polish rebels in the 1863 uprising. Napoleon had given strong support to Italy, but refused the demand for Rome, and kept French troops in Rome to protect the pope from the new Italian government, thus leading to Italian refusal to help. The United States remained alienated because of the fiasco in Mexico. Napoleon did not know what he wanted or what to do, but the reverse was true for Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck, who planned to create a great new German nation, based on Prussian power, as well as resurgent German nationalism based on the systematic humiliation of France. After seeing the defeat of Austria, the Emperor demanded a conscription law. The parliament disagreed, maintaining that professionals would be always the better option, and outvoted, he backed down.

The immediate issue was a trivial controversy regarding control of the Spanish throne. France was successful in the diplomatic standoff, but Napoleon wanted to humiliate the Prussian king, William I. Bismarck in turn manipulated the situation such that France declared war against Prussia on 15 July 1870 after major protests in France (however, Napoleon was reluctant as he had become ill as well as being sceptical of the outcome), thus sparking the Franco-Prussian War. The French empire made the first move, as the Emperor led a charge that crossed the German border. On August 2, the French defeated a Prussian vanguard and occupied the town of Saarbrücken. Two days later, the Prussians launched an offensive that repulsed the French army. After the first nine days of August, France experienced major losses. The Emperor handed power to the other generals and let them command, then telegrammed his wife, asking if he should return to Paris. His wife refused, and thus he only sent his son home. The French prime minister resigned, being replaced with a more effective military leader, who soldered the disorganised and demoralised French. He forged the Army of Châlons, which, led by Marshal Patrice de MacMahon and the Emperor, attempted to relieve the Siege of Metz, where the largest French army lay entrapped. The army was repulsed by the Prussians, and retreated to Sedan, where it was surrounded and forced to surrender after the Battle of Sedan. Napoleon himself became a prisoner and Republican forces quickly took control of Paris.

France, under the leadership of Léon Gambetta, declared the establishment of the Third French Republic. Napoleon and Eugénie went into exile in England. Victory produced an onrush of German nationalism that Bismarck immediately seized to unite all of the German states (except Austria), thereby creating the German Empire, with the Prussian king as its emperor and Bismarck as chancellor. The new Germany was now continental Europe&#x27;s dominant military force. Additionally, France was forced to give up the two border provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, and its humiliation lasted for generations.

==Structure of government==
The structure of the French government during the Second Empire was little changed from the First. Emperor Napoleon III stressed his own imperial role as the foundation of the government; if government was to guide the people toward domestic justice and external peace, it was his role as emperor, holding his power by universal male suffrage and representing all of the people, to function as supreme leader and safeguard the achievements of the revolution.

He had so often, while in prison or in exile, chastised previous oligarchical governments for neglecting social questions that it was imperative France now prioritise their solutions. His answer was to organise a system of government based on the principles of the &quot;Napoleonic Idea&quot;. This meant that the emperor, the elect of the people as the representative of the democracy, ruled supreme. He himself drew power and legitimacy from his role as representative of the great Napoleon I of France, &quot;who had sprung armed from the French Revolution like Minerva from the head of Jove&quot;.

The anti-parliamentary French Constitution of 1852 instituted by Napoleon III on 14 January 1852 was largely a repetition of that of 1848. All executive power was entrusted to the emperor, who, as head of state, was solely responsible to the people. The people of the Empire, lacking democratic rights, were to rely on the benevolence of the emperor rather than on the benevolence of politicians. He was to nominate the members of the council of state, whose duty it was to prepare the laws, and of the senate, a body permanently established as a constituent part of the empire.

One innovation was made, namely that the legislative body was elected by universal suffrage but had no right of initiative, all laws being proposed by the executive power. This new political change was rapidly followed by the same consequence as had attended that of Brumaire. On 2 December 1852, France, still under the effect of Napoleon&#x27;s legacy, and the fear of anarchy, conferred almost unanimously by a plebiscite the supreme power, with the title of emperor, upon Napoleon III.

The Legislative Body was not allowed to elect its own president or to regulate its own procedure, or to propose a law or an amendment, or to vote on the budget in detail, or to make its deliberations public. Similarly, universal suffrage was supervised and controlled by means of official candidature, by forbidding free speech and action in electoral matters to the Opposition, and by a gerrymandering in such a way as to overwhelm the liberal vote in the mass of the rural population. The press was subjected to a system of &quot;cautionnements&quot; (&quot;caution money&quot;, deposited as a guarantee of good behaviour) and &quot;avertissements&quot; (requests by the authorities to cease publication of certain articles), under sanction of suspension or suppression. Books were subject to censorship.

To counteract the opposition of individuals, a surveillance of suspects was instituted. Felice Orsini&#x27;s attack on the emperor in 1858, though purely Italian in its motive, served as a pretext for increasing the severity of this régime by the law of general security (&quot;sûreté générale&quot;) which authorised the internment, exile or deportation of any suspect without trial. In the same way public instruction was strictly supervised, the teaching of philosophy was suppressed in the &quot;lycées&quot;, and the disciplinary powers of the administration were increased.

For seven years France had no democratic life. The Empire governed by a series of plebiscites. Up to 1857 the Opposition did not exist; from then until 1860 it was reduced to five members: Alfred Darimon, Émile Ollivier, Hénon, Jules Favre, and Ernest Picard. The royalists waited inactive after the new and unsuccessful attempt made at Frohsdorf in 1853, by a combination of the legitimists and Orléanists, to re-create a living monarchy out of the ruin of two royal families.

== Memorialisation ==
The Empress Eugenie created a memorial to the Second Empire in England in the 1880s. Exiled in Farnborough, Hampshire, she turned her house at Farnborough Hill into a Bonapartist shrine, filling the interior with the remnants of the imperial collection (returned to her in early 1881) and reconstructing elements of the display at the imperial palaces before 1870. 

On an adjacent hill she created a spectacular Mausoleum, today St Michael&#x27;s Abbey, where the bodies of Napoleon III and the Prince Imperial were interred in 1888. The imperial crypt at Farnborough remains the only official monument to Napoleon III and the Second Empire.

<text>Home Alone is a 1990 American Christmas comedy film directed by Chris Columbus, and written and produced by John Hughes. The first film in the &quot;Home Alone&quot; franchise, the film stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, an eight-year old boy who defends his Chicago home from a home invasion by a pair of robbers after his family accidentally leave him behind on their Christmas vacation to Paris. The cast also features Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Catherine O&#x27;Hara.

Hughes conceived &quot;Home Alone&quot; while on vacation, with Warner Bros. being originally intended to finance and distribute the film. However, Warner Bros. shut down the production after it exceeded its assigned budget. 20th Century Fox assumed responsibilities following meetings with Hughes. Columbus and Culkin were hired soon afterwards. Filming took place between February and May 1990 on location across Illinois.

&quot;Home Alone&quot; had a sneak preview across 1,000 theaters on November 10, 1990, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 16. While the film&#x27;s reception was initially mixed, in later years reception has been generally positive, with praise for its cast, humor, and music. &quot;Home Alone&quot; grossed $476.7 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1990. It made Culkin a child star, and was the highest-grossing live-action comedy for two decades. It was nominated for two Academy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. &quot;Home Alone&quot; has since been considered one of the best Christmas films. In 2023, &quot;Home Alone&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, was released in 1992.

==Plot==

The McCallister family prepares to spend Christmas in Paris, gathering at Kate and Peter&#x27;s home in a Chicago suburb on the night before their departure. Kate and Peter&#x27;s youngest son Kevin is ridiculed by his siblings and cousins due to his immaturity. Kevin inadvertently ruins the family dinner after a scuffle with his oldest brother Buzz, resulting in Kate sending him up to the attic. Frustrated with Kate for allowing the rest of the family to pick on him, Kevin wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds create a power outage, disabling the alarm clocks and causing the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is accidentally left behind.

Kevin wakes to find the house empty and the family cars still in the garage, unaware that they had used shuttle service vans to take them to the airport. Thinking that his wish has come true, he is overjoyed with his newfound freedom. Later, Kevin becomes frightened by his eccentric next-door neighbor, &quot;Old Man&quot; Marley, rumored to be a serial killer nicknamed the &quot;South-Bend Shovel Slayer&quot; who murdered his own family. The McCallister home is soon stalked by the &quot;Wet Bandits&quot;, Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into and robbing other vacant houses in the area. Kevin tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to postpone their plans to rob the McCallister house.

Kate realizes mid-flight that Kevin was left behind, and upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked, and that the phone lines are still down back home in Chicago. Peter and the rest of the family stay at his brother Rob&#x27;s apartment in Paris while Kate stays at the airport. Unable to book a flight back to Chicago, Kate convinces a couple to trade tickets with her. When she eventually arrives in the US, she meets Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, who offers to let her travel with them to Chicago in a moving van on the way to Milwaukee.

On Christmas Eve, Harry and Marv finally realize that only Kevin is in the McCallister home, and Kevin overhears them discussing plans to break into the house that night. He starts to miss his family and asks the local Santa Claus impersonator if he could bring them back for Christmas. Kevin attends a church choir performance, eventually re-encountering Marley, who proves the rumors about himself to be false. Marley points out his granddaughter in the choir and mentions he has never met her since she is the daughter of his estranged son. Kevin suggests he try to reconcile with his son.

Kevin returns home and rigs the house with handmade booby traps. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer all sorts injuries. Kevin calls the police and lures the duo into another vacant neighboring house that they had previously broken into and robbed. Harry and Marv ambush Kevin and prepare to get their revenge, but Marley intervenes and knocks them out cold with his snow shovel. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses that they broke into due to Marv&#x27;s habit of flooding them.

On Christmas Day, Kevin is initially disappointed to find that his family is still gone. However, Kate arrives home and they reconcile. The rest of the family then returns after waiting in Paris for a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry&#x27;s knocked-out gold tooth. Kevin then happily watches Marley reuniting with his family.

===Development===
Writer and producer John Hughes conceived &quot;Home Alone&quot; while preparing to go on vacation. He said: &quot;I was going away on vacation, and making a list of everything I didn&#x27;t want to forget. I thought, &#x27;Well, I&#x27;d better not forget my kids.&#x27; Then I thought, &#x27;What if I left my 10-year-old son at home? What would he do? Hughes wrote eight pages of notes that developed into the screenplay. Imagining that children are naturally most scared of robbers, Hughes also worked that aspect into the plot of the film.

&quot;Home Alone&quot; was initially set to be financed and distributed by Warner Bros. Hughes promised that he could make the movie for less than $10 million, considerably less than most feature film production budgets of that era. Concerned that the film might exceed that amount, Hughes met secretly with 20th Century Fox before production to see if they would fund the project if Warner Bros. proved inflexible. According to executive producer Scott Rosenfelt, a copy of the script was &quot;clandestinely&quot; delivered to Fox, bypassing the legal restrictions that would have otherwise prevented Fox from seeing it until the project was in turnaround. Early in production, the budget grew to $14.7 million. Warner Bros. demanded that it be cut by $1.2 million; the producers responded with a memo arguing that the budget could not be cut any further. Unconvinced, Warner Bros. shut down production the next day, but it quickly resumed when Fox took up Hughes on his offer. The final budget grew to $18 million.

Hughes had asked Patrick Read Johnson to direct, but he was committed to directing &quot;Spaced Invaders&quot; (1990). He turned to Chris Columbus, who had left &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989) before shooting started because of a personality clash with starring actor Chevy Chase, who Columbus said treated him &quot;like dirt&quot;. Hughes gave him the scripts for both &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Reach the Rock&quot; (1998); Columbus chose to direct &quot;Home Alone&quot;, as he found it funnier and liked the Christmas theme. Columbus did an uncredited rewrite of the script; among his contributions was the character of Old Man Marley, which he created to give the story a more serious layer, as well as a more emotional, happier ending.

===Casting===

Hughes suggested to Columbus that they cast Macaulay Culkin as Kevin, because of his experience while shooting &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989). Columbus met with 200 other actors for the part, as he felt it was his &quot;directorial responsibility&quot;. John Mulaney was asked to audition for the role of Kevin after being scouted in a children&#x27;s sketch comedy group, but his parents refused the opportunity. Columbus finally met with Culkin and agreed he was the right choice.

After Robert De Niro and Jon Lovitz turned down the role of Harry, Joe Pesci accepted it. The role of Uncle Frank was written for Kelsey Grammer, but was given to Gerry Bamman when Grammer was unavailable.

Daniel Stern was cast as Marv, but before shooting started, he was told that the production schedule had been extended from six weeks to eight. He dropped out after as he would not be paid more for the extended schedule. Daniel Roebuck was hired to replace him, but after two days of rehearsal, Columbus felt he was lacking chemistry with Pesci and brought back Stern. Roebuck later said that, although he was upset to be fired from the production, he now believed the experience was &quot;a little blip of unimportance&quot;. Chris Farley auditioned for the role of the Santa Claus impersonator, but he failed to impress Columbus.

John Candy was available for only one day to film his scenes, which took 23 hours to shoot. He was paid only $414, since he did the film as a favor to Hughes. In return, he was the only actor Hughes allowed to go off-script; according to Columbus, all his dialogue was improvised.

===Filming===

Principal photography took place from February 14, 1990, to May 8, 1990, over a course of 83 days on an $18.3 million budget. The house exterior scenes were filmed on location at a three-story single-family house located at 671 Lincoln Avenue in the North Shore village of Winnetka, Illinois, where many of Hughes&#x27; previous films had also been shot, but at different houses. The only interiors of the house used for filming that made it to the finished film were the main staircase, attic and most of the first floor landing, while all the other interiors of the house were duplicated on a sound stage to allow more room for equipment and crew. These sets were built in the then-disused gym of New Trier High School&#x27;s west campus, previously used by Hughes for &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; and &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, where the production company had already set up its offices. 671 Lincoln Avenue later became a tourist attraction. The tree house in the backyard was built specifically for the film and dismantled after filming ended.

Kevin runs away from his third encounter with Marley in Hubbard Woods Park in Winnetka. In addition, the scene where Kevin wades in his neighbor&#x27;s flooded basement was shot at the empty swimming pool of the aforementioned campus of New Trier High School, with the American Airlines DC-10 first class cabin interiors done on the basketball courts. The church exteriors were shot at Trinity United Methodist Church in Wilmette, Illinois, while the interiors were shot at Grace Episcopal Church in Oak Park, Illinois. Filming also took place over four sixteen-hour days at O&#x27;Hare International Airport, which served for both itself and Orly Airport in Paris. John Candy filmed his cameo appearance for the film over the course of one day at Meigs Field.

For the film within a film, &quot;Angels with Filthy Souls&quot; (the title of which parodies the 1938 crime film &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;), shooting took only one day, on the final &quot;test day&quot; prior to the official start of principal photography. To create the illusion that the film was an authentic 1940s gangster film, the scene was filmed on black-and-white negative film, and Johnny&#x27;s office featured props from that era. Like much of the film, most of the sequence was shot with low, wide angles that, according to journalist Darryn King, &quot;capture the action as if a child were perceiving it&quot;. Originally, Ralph Foody was to play Snakes and Michael Guido was to play Johnny, but since Foody had recently undergone knee replacement surgery, he was unable to do the death scene where Snakes drops to his knees, leading to the roles being switched.

Cinematographer Julio Macat recalled that Pesci was more difficult to work with than Culkin. The older actor believed some of the dialogue was not of a quality commensurate with his acting ability. He also resented the early unit calls, since they prevented him from starting his day with nine holes of golf as he preferred to do. After he took the assistant director by the collar one day to complain about this, daily call times were moved back from 7 to 9 a.m. to accommodate his rounds. On the other end of the schedule, the crew had limited time to film the many nighttime scenes, since Culkin could not work any later than 10 p.m. due to his age.

Pesci said in a 2022 interview with &quot;People&quot; of working with Culkin, &quot;I intentionally limited my interactions with him to preserve the dynamic&quot; and made sure not &quot;to come across on the screen that we were in any way friendly&quot; in order to &quot;maintain the integrity of the adversarial relationship&quot;.

On the set, Pesci and Stern both had difficulty refraining from cursing, which became annoying to Pesci, since Culkin was on set as well. In fact, the only curse words that made it into the film were &quot;shit&quot;, accidentally said by Daniel Stern when his shoe fell through the pet door, and &quot;hell&quot;, which was said by both Pesci and Stern after their characters encounter one another after going through Kevin&#x27;s booby traps and by Johnny to the character of Snakes in &quot;Angels with Filthy Souls&quot;. Pesci&#x27;s use of &quot;cartoon cursing&quot;, or menacing gibberish, garnered comparisons to &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character Yosemite Sam.

The film&#x27;s stunts also created tension for the crew during shooting. Columbus said, &quot;Every time the stunt guys did one of those stunts it wasn&#x27;t funny. We&#x27;d watch it, and I would just pray that the guys were alive.&quot; Stunts were originally prepared with safety harnesses, but because of their visibility on camera, the film&#x27;s final stunts were performed without them. Troy Brown and Leon Delaney were stuntmen for Pesci and Stern, respectively. An injury had occurred between Pesci and Culkin during one of the rehearsals for the scene in which Harry tries to bite off Kevin&#x27;s finger; Culkin still has the scar. The tarantula that walks on Stern&#x27;s face was real.

Senta Moses, who played Tracy, recalled in 2020 that one of the most difficult scenes to shoot was the family&#x27;s run through O&#x27;Hare International Airport to catch their flight. While it does not last long, it required several days to film. &quot;There were thousands of extras, all expertly choreographed so none of us would be in danger running at full speed through the American Airlines terminal&quot;, she told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. &quot;And we ran at &quot;full speed&quot;. Sometimes we&#x27;d bump into each other, like a multi-car pileup on the expressway, and just crack up laughing ... There were so many setups and narrowly missed moments of disaster, but to my knowledge, no one got hurt.&quot;

==Music==

Columbus initially hoped to have Bruce Broughton score the film, and early posters listed him as the composer. However, Broughton was busy with &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990), and he had to cancel at the last minute. Columbus was later able to get in touch with Steven Spielberg, who helped him contact John Williams to produce the final score. Traditional Christmas songs, such as &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot;, are featured prominently in the film, as well as the film&#x27;s theme song &quot;Somewhere in My Memory&quot;. The soundtrack was released by Sony Classical Records on cassette on December 4, 1990, and on CD on May 27, 2015.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Home Alone&quot; had a sneak preview screening for about 1,000 theaters on November 10, 1990. The advanced screening proved successful, with 5% of the preview audience returning for its official release the following week. Originally scheduled to be released on Thanksgiving weekend, its opening date was brought forward to avoid direct competition with &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot;. It was given a wide release on November 16, 1990.

===Home media===
&quot;Home Alone&quot; was first released by Fox Video on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States on August 22, 1991, their first video to go direct to sell-through rather than to the video rental market first. It sold 11 million copies, generating Fox revenue of $150 million making it, along with &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, the highest-selling video of all time at that point. Due to the sales, the film did not perform as well in the rental market.

It was later released on DVD on October 5, 1999, as a basic package. The film was released on Blu-ray on December 2, 2008, titled &quot;Family Fun Edition&quot;, and was released alongside &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; in a collection pack on October 5, 2010. The film was reissued again on DVD and Blu-ray on October 6, 2015, alongside all four of its sequels in a box set titled &quot;Home Alone: 25th Anniversary Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Christmas Edition&quot;.

On September 15, 2020, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment and 20th Century Home Entertainment released &quot;Home Alone&quot; on Ultra HD Blu-ray in time for its 30th anniversary in the United States.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Home Alone&quot; grossed $285.8 million in the United States and Canada and $190.9 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $476.7 million, against a production budget of $18 million. In its opening weekend, &quot;Home Alone&quot; grossed $17 million from 1,202 theaters, averaging $14,211 per site and just 6% of the final total and added screens over the next six weeks, with a peak screen count of 2,174 during its eighth weekend at the start of January 1991.

&quot;Home Alone&quot; was the number-one film at the box office for 12 consecutive weeks, from its release weekend of November 16–18, 1990, through the weekend of February 1–3, 1991. It was removed from the top spot when &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; opened with $13 million. It remained in the top ten until the weekend of April 26, well past Easter weekend. It made two more appearances in the top ten (the weekend of May 31 – June 2 and the weekend of June 14–16) before finally falling out of the top ten. After over nine months into its run, the film had earned 16x its debut weekend and ended up making a final gross of $285,761,243, the top-grossing film of its year in North America. The film is listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the highest-grossing live-action comedy ever and held the record until it was overtaken by &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot; in 2011.

By the time the film had run its course in theaters, &quot;Home Alone&quot; was the third-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide, as well as in the United States and Canada, behind only &quot;Star Wars&quot; ($322 million at the time) and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; ($399 million at the time), according to the home video box. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 67.7 million tickets in the United States. It was also the highest-grossing Christmas film until it was surpassed by &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; The Grinch&quot; in 2018. The film made Culkin a child star.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Home Alone&quot; holds an approval rating of 66% based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Home Alone&quot;″s uneven but frequently funny premise stretched unreasonably thin is buoyed by Macaulay Culkin&#x27;s cute performance and strong supporting stars.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on nine critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine praised the film for its cast. Jeanne Cooper of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film for its comedic approach. Hal Hinson, also of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, praised Columbus&#x27;s direction and Culkin&#x27;s performance. Although Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; complained that the film&#x27;s first half is &quot;flat and unsurprising as its cute little premise suggests&quot;, she praised the second half for its slapstick humor. She also praised the dialogue between Kevin and Marley, as well as the film&#x27;s final scenes. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a out of a 4-star rating. He compared the elaborate booby-traps in the film to Rube Goldberg machines, writing &quot;they&#x27;re the kinds of traps that any 8-year-old could devise, if he had a budget of tens of thousands of dollars and the assistance of a crew of movie special effects people&quot; and criticized the plot as &quot;so implausible that it makes it hard for [him] to really care about the plight of the kid [Kevin]&quot;. However, he praised Culkin&#x27;s performance.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine gave the film a &quot;D&quot; grade, criticizing the film for its &quot;sadistic festival of adult-bashing&quot;. Gleiberman said that John Hughes &quot;is pulling our strings as though he&#x27;d never learn to do anything else&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film three out of five and praised Culkin&#x27;s &quot;vivid screen presence, almost incandescent with confidence&quot;. However, he criticized his acting, calling it &quot;a bit broad and mannered&quot;. Ali Barclay of the BBC wrote, &quot;Culkin walks a fine line between annoyance and endearment throughout the film.&quot; He also called &quot;Home Alone&quot; &quot;a film which manages to capture some of the best qualities of Christmas&quot;.

Naomi Barnwell of &quot;Roobla&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Home Alone&quot; has all the ingredients that make for a great kids&#x27; film&quot;. Adrian Turner of Radio Times called the movie &quot;a celebration of enterprise that captured the heart and wickedness of every child on the planet.&quot; According to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;[&quot;Home Alone&quot;]&#x27;s slapstick falls flat and only the pain remains.&quot; Marielle Sabbag of &quot;Vocal&quot; wrote &quot;Everything about [&quot;Home Alone&quot;] is beautiful and has a realistic quality.&quot; Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; criticized the gags, writing they leave &quot;a sour aftertaste&quot;. He added &quot;this film plays better as a trailer than as a full-length film&quot; when a trailer lets viewers appreciate those &quot;without having to fight off a lot of unsettling associations&quot;.

&quot;Home Alone&quot; gradually became a Christmas classic. It was praised for its quotable phrases, traps, and main character. Hannah-Rose Yee of &quot;Stylist&quot; called the ending &quot;very sweet&quot; and praised the score from John Williams, calling it &quot;fantastic&quot;. Christopher Hooton of &quot;The Independent&quot; also praised the film, calling the film-within-a-film &quot;Angels with Filthy Souls&quot; &quot;a fond footnote in cinema history&quot;. Matt Talbot from &quot;Simcoe.com&quot; said that the Wet Bandits were &quot;fantastic&quot; and &quot;never [got] old&quot; on &quot;repeat viewings&quot;. Michael Walsh of &quot;Nerdist&quot; noted the church scene as &quot;One of the best, most touching scenes [in the film]&quot;.

&quot;Home Alone&quot; remains a highly popular Christmas movie in Poland, when it is played on Polsat every Christmas Eve. In 2010, Polsat did not play &quot;Home Alone&quot;, which caused over 90,000 people to protest on Facebook. In 2016, over 4.44 million Poles tuned in to Polsat to watch &quot;Home Alone&quot;. Since the 2010s, its TV trailers even include a tagline that acknowledges this popularity: &quot;Christmas without him? It&#x27;s absolutely impossible!&quot;. The movie is also highly popular in Romania, being played by Pro TV since 1995, except 2021 when the movie was played by Antena 1. In 2014, over 2.7 million Romanians watched the movie on Pro TV.

Julio Macat, the film&#x27;s cinematographer, considers &quot;Home Alone&quot; his favorite film out of all the projects he has shot. It was the favorite film of former U.S. President Gerald Ford.

===Accolades===
At the 12th Youth in Film Awards, Macaulay Culkin won Best Young Actor Starring in a Motion Picture. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Original Score, which was written by John Williams, and the other for Best Original Song for &quot;Somewhere in My Memory&quot;, music by Williams and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, but lost to &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; respectively.

===Accusations of plagiarism===
The 1989 French horror thriller film &quot;3615 code Père Noël&quot;, which is about a young boy who is home alone with his elderly grandfather and has to fend off a home invader dressed up as Santa Claus, has been noted for its plot similarities to &quot;Home Alone&quot;. &quot;3615 code Père Noël&quot; director René Manzor threatened the producers of &quot;Home Alone&quot; with legal action on the grounds of plagiarism, alleging that &quot;Home Alone&quot; was a remake of his film. &quot;3615 code Père Noël&quot; was not released in the United States during its original theatrical run in January 1990 and did not become widely available there until 2018.

==Use in media==
The music video for Snoop Dogg&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; opens with a gag where, after a teenaged Snoop&#x27;s parents have left him to watch the house in their absence, he places his hands to his face and yells in the manner of Kevin McCallister in the first film, while a title comes on screen reading &quot;Home Boy Alone&quot;. In December 2015, Culkin reprised his role as an adult Kevin McCallister in the inaugural episode of the Jack Dishel web series &quot;DRYVRS&quot; in which a visibly disturbed McCallister recounts his experiences from the events of the first film and subsequently uses his signature tactics against a gunman. In response, Daniel Stern posted a short video reprising his role as Marv, released in conjunction with Stern&#x27;s Reddit AMA, pleading for support from Harry against McCallister&#x27;s traps.

The 2016 Christmas-set horror film &quot;Better Watch Out&quot; includes a scene where a character who is obsessed with the &quot;Home Alone&quot; films demonstrates how, in real life, it would be deadly for someone to be hit in the face with a paint can swung from a distance. The season 13 episode of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Home Alone&quot; is intended to be a direct parody of the first &quot;Home Alone&quot; film. In the episode, Charlie Kelly is accidentally forgotten while the rest of &quot;the gang&quot; attend Super Bowl LII. Charlie mistakenly believes he must protect the bar by setting up traps, only for himself to accidentally activate said traps, nearly preventing from performing his Super Bowl &quot;rituals&quot;.

On December 15, 2018, Culkin made a guest appearance as himself in an episode of &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot; to review multiple video game adaptations of the first two &quot;Home Alone&quot; films, as well as a gameplay session of &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; with James Rolfe and Mike Matei in the days following that episode&#x27;s release. On December 19, 2018, Culkin again reprised his role as McCallister in a 60-second advertisement for Google Assistant titled &quot;Home Alone Again,&quot; which parodies the original film. The commercial contains shot-for-shot remakes of several scenes from the film in which McCallister uses several of the product&#x27;s functions. The concluding scene involves a command sequence intended to make the house look active, parodying the original &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; scene.

&quot;Home Alone&quot; is prominently referenced in the 2022 action comedy film &quot;Violent Night&quot;, in which Trudy Lightston, a fan of the film, imitates Kevin&#x27;s fighting tactics against burglars who take her family hostage.

== Use in Poland ==
Films such as &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988) are very popular at Christmas time in Poland, because they were some of the first Western movies to be released in Poland since the end of communist rule. However, the Polish premiere of &quot;Home Alone&quot; took place not during the Christmas season but on May 22, 1992. Three years later, on Christmas Day 1995, at 20:10 CET on TVP1, the Polish television premiere of the film took place. Then three times on December 26, 1997, and December 24 and 25, 1999, the film was broadcast on television TVN.
In December 2000, 8.9 million Poles were watching &quot;Home Alone&quot; on Christmas Eve; by 2017, about four million people (11.6% of Poland&#x27;s population) were watching it on Christmas Eve and in 2018 again on the same day the film recorded the highest viewership, with 4.51 million viewers.

==Other media==
===Novelization===
&quot;Home Alone&quot; () was novelized by Todd Strasser and published by Scholastic in 1990 to coincide with the film. On October 6, 2015, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie, an illustrated book () by Kim Smith and Quirk Books was released.

===Sequels and franchise===

The film was followed by a commercially successful sequel in 1992, &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, which brought back most of the first film&#x27;s cast. Culkin was paid $4.5 million to appear in the sequel, compared to $110,000 for the original. The film within a film, &quot;Angels with Filthy Souls&quot;, had a sequel in &quot;Home Alone 2&quot;, &quot;Angels with Even Filthier Souls&quot;. Both &quot;Angels&quot; meta-films featured character actor Ralph Foody as stereotypical 1930s mobster Johnny. A third film, &quot;Home Alone 3&quot;, was released in 1997; it has entirely different actors and characters as well as a different storyline, with Hughes writing the screenplay.

A television film followed in 2002: &quot;Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House&quot;. The movie features some of the same characters who were in the first two films, but with a new cast and a storyline. The fifth film, &quot;The Holiday Heist&quot;, premiered during ABC Family&#x27;s Countdown to 25 Days of Christmas programming event on November 25, 2012. Similarly to the third film, it does not focus on the McCallister family. Chris Columbus later revealed that there had been discussions on a sequel starring Kevin&#x27;s son: &quot;This was talked about maybe 10 years ago I don&#x27;t know, we were just having fun with it and we said, &#x27;What if Kevin is an adult and he has a kid?&#x27; But it was still Pesci and Stern Pesci and Stern are still obsessed with this kid. They&#x27;re going to get this kid.&quot; Another idea that was once discussed involved an adult Kevin attempting revenge on Harry and Marv, who have reformed in the years since they last met. The studio declined to make the film despite Columbus &amp; Culkin&#x27;s interest in the idea.

A sixth film was released digitally on Disney+ on November 12, 2021, titled &quot;Home Sweet Home Alone&quot;. Devin Ratray, who played Buzz McCallister in the first two films, reprised his role in the film.

<text>KC and the Sunshine Band is an American disco and funk band that was founded in 1973 in Hialeah, Florida. Their best-known songs include the hits &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way (I Like It)&quot;, &quot;(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Boogie Man&quot;, &quot;Keep It Comin&#x27; Love&quot;, &quot;Boogie Shoes&quot;, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, and &quot;Give It Up&quot;. The band took its name from lead vocalist Harry Wayne Casey&#x27;s last name (&#x27;KC&#x27;) and the &#x27;Sunshine Band&#x27; from KC&#x27;s home state of Florida, the Sunshine State. The group had five number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart: four in the 1970&#x27;s as well as the first number one song of the 1980&#x27;s.

==History==
===1970s===
The band was formed in 1973 by Harry Wayne Casey (KC) and Richard Finch. Casey was a record store employee and part-timer at TK Records in Hialeah, Florida The band was originally called&quot; KC &amp; The Sunshine Junkanoo Band&quot; because KC used studio musicians from TK and a local Junkanoo band called the Miami Junkanoo Band. During this time, bassist Richard Finch had been engineering records for TK, which is how the Casey-Finch musical collaboration began. They were soon joined by guitarist Jerome Smith and drummer Robert Johnson, both TK studio musicians.

The first few songs, &quot;Blow Your Whistle&quot; (September 1973) and &quot;Sound Your Funky Horn&quot; (February 1974), were released as singles, and did well enough on the U.S. R&amp;B chart and overseas that TK wanted a follow-up single and album. In the meantime, while working on demos for KC &amp; the Sunshine Band, the song &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot; (George McCrae) was created. Written by Casey and Finch, it featured Smith on guitar and became a number one hit in 51 countries in mid-1974. The band&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Clubs&quot;, which featured uncredited vocals by McCrae, was a hit in the UK, peaking at number 7, and they went on a tour there in 1975.

KC and other band members were frequent guests on WHYI-FM, branded as Y-100, one of southeast Florida&#x27;s more powerful FM pop stations, that covered Dade and Broward Counties and beyond. This gave the band significant hometown exposure, during the rise of the disco genre in one of its epicenters.

The release of the self-titled second album &quot;KC and the Sunshine Band&quot; in 1975 spawned the group&#x27;s first major U.S. hit with &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot;. It topped the R&amp;B chart in April and hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in August. The group received two nominations at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards held in February 1976. &quot;That&#x27;s the Way (I Like It)&quot; also became a number one hit in November 1975. The 1976 album &quot;Part 3&quot; yielded two number one singles: &quot;I&#x27;m Your Boogie Man&quot; and &quot;(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty&quot;. For the latter, the group received a nomination at the 19th Annual Grammy Awards. Another hit, &quot;Keep It Comin&#x27; Love&quot;(1977), peaked at number two in the US. Their success lasted until the fifth album from 1979; their last chart topping hit was &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, hitting number one for one week in January 1980, and becoming the first number one hit of the 1980s. With the explosion of new wave music and the declining popularity of disco, the group explored other styles and changed labels, joining Epic Records in 1980 after TK Records went bankrupt.

With a change in styles, Casey enjoyed success, dueting with Teri DeSario with &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m Ready&quot;, which hit No. 2 in March 1980; the adult contemporary sound was much different from his disco hits of the 1970s, and his first major success away from the Sunshine Band.

===1980s===
In 1981, the partnership between Finch and Casey came to an acrimonious end. Two years after the release of the previous album, the band released two albums with new material: &quot;The Painter&quot; (1981) and &quot;Space Cadet Solo Flight&quot; (1981). These albums did not chart, but in 1982, with &quot;All in a Night&#x27;s Work&quot; a hit track called &quot;Give It Up&quot; (1983) brought a return to success in the UK, and appeared one year later in the U.S. Top 40. The song was also featured on the band&#x27;s next album, 1983&#x27;s &quot;KC Ten&quot;. Epic Records, however, refused to issue the song as a single due to its prior failure in the US. Because of this, a frustrated Casey formed Meca Records, releasing the single himself on this label in a final attempt to garner the song some success in America. It worked, but the album still failed to meet expectations. This led to the group falling into stasis around 1984 with Casey&#x27;s retirement.

===1990s===
A revival of interest in disco music in 1991 brought Casey out of retirement. He reformed the band with some new members and two other original members, (percussionist Fermin Goytisolo and vocalist Beverly Champion-Foster) and began touring once again. The new band has released a large number of compilation albums through Rhino Records, along with some newly recorded material. The album &quot;Oh Yeah!&quot; was released in 1993 after a ten-year gap between new albums (excluding compilations).

===2000s and beyond===

On July 28, 2000, guitarist Jerome Smith died while working as a bulldozer operator.

On August 2, 2002, KC and the Sunshine Band were given a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 2001 and 2007, the band released the albums &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There For You&quot; and &quot;Yummy&quot;. Both were composed of archived material recorded before their hiatus.

They appeared in the 2003 remake of the movie &quot;The In-Laws&quot;.

On July 6, 2013, KC and the Sunshine Band were honored with a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars.

On July 1, 2024, the KC and the Sunshine Band Musical &quot;Who Do Ya Love?&quot; premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and is now in production for future release.

<text>Essonodon is a mammal genus from the Upper Cretaceous of North America. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata and lived towards the end of the &quot;age of the dinosaurs.&quot; It is within the suborder Cimolodonta and perhaps the family Cimolomyidae. It contains a single species, Essonodon browni, formerly also known as &quot;Cimolodon nitidus&quot; (Marsh 1889).

The genus &quot;Essonodon&quot; was named by Simpson G.G. in 1927, and is also partly known as &quot;Cimolodon&quot;. The inclusion of this taxon within Cimolomyidae is tentative. (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum 2001, p. 408). 

Fossils are known from the late Campanian to the end of the Maastrichtian. They are known from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana &amp; North Dakota (USA), the Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan (Canada), and the Fruitland &amp; Ojo Alamo Formations of New Mexico (USA).

This species was a large multituberculate that weighed in at over 2.5 kilograms.

<text>A climbing harness is a piece of equipment that allows a climber to tie in to the safety of a rope. It is used in rock and ice climbing, abseiling, and lowering; this is in contrast to other activities requiring ropes for access or safety such as industrial rope work (such as window cleaning), construction, and rescue and recovery, which use safety harnesses instead.

==Overview==
While an improvised harness can be created out of a length of rope or nylon webbing, commercially produced harnesses specific to climbing rock and ice are the norm. These characteristically include a dedicated tie-in loop, padding, and amenities such as gear loops. Most commercial climbing harnesses meet the guidelines and manufacturing standards of organizations such as the Union Internationale des Associations d&#x27;Alpinisme (UiAA) or European Committee for Standardization.

Harnesses of users involved in climbing should be attached to dynamic (kernmantle) rope, which has a natural shock-absorbing stretch. In via ferrata, the harness is attached to metal cables via a shock absorber that can absorb some of the impact of a fall.

The most common knot for attaching a harness to a rope is the figure-eight follow through, characteristically backed up by a stopper knot. Although it is harder to untie after a fall than some alternatives, it is inherently more secure, easier to tie, and easier to verify that it has been tied correctly. There are many variations of the bowline knot, including a variation of the double bowline, and some will untie themselves when repeatedly stressed and unstressed, as is common in climbing.

A harness&#x27; gear loops, used for carrying such equipment as protection devices, carabiners, etc., are not weight-bearing; nor are the elastic cords which restrain the leg loops from slipping down while not under load.

== History ==
The invention of the climbing harness has been attributed to Jeanne Immink, a Dutch climber in the late nineteenth century. Some of the first climbing harnesses were devised in the U.K. in the early 1960s by Alan Waterhouse, Paul Seddon and Tony Howard who went on to form the Troll climbing equipment manufacturers. A harness designed by British climber Don Whillans was made by Troll for the 1970 Annapurna South Face Expedition. It went into mass production shortly afterwards and soon became popular worldwide.

The sit or seat harness was invented in the 1960s by Yosemite climbers. The first innovation was the Swami Belt, which was multiple loops of webbing around the waist. Then quickly came the Swami Seat, a sit harness tied from webbing revealed to the climbing world thru an article in Summit Magazine in the mid-60s, which included leg loops and an integrated waist loop. Once the seat/sit harness came to be, suppliers of climbing gear started making them with stitching replacing the knots.

== Types ==

A sit harness consists of a waist belt and two leg loops which are normally connected in the front of the hips through a permanent webbing loop called a &quot;belay loop&quot;. Belay loops are extremely strong, but nonetheless still a single point of failure that caused at least one notorious death. For rock climbing, the rope typically goes through the two &quot;tie-in loops&quot; that are above and below the &quot;belay loop&quot;. The figure-eight knot is mostly used for rock climbing. These are the most commonly used harnesses for recreational activities such as abseiling and rock climbing, as they afford a wide range of movement while still maintaining a high level of safety. Ensuring the harness fits correctly is key to avoiding pain in the upper thigh area caused by the leg loops being too tight around the upper legs and groin area, while at the same time ensuring that a climber flipped over in a fall does not slip out. The waist belt should be tightened snugly.

A chest harness is worn around the shoulders, usually with a sit harness so as to provide an additional attachment point. This attachment point allows for better balance in some situations such as when carrying a heavy pack (as the centre of mass is above the connection to the rope) and when the person in the harness may be unable to maintain an upright position (due to injury or other influences).

A sling harness is an improvised harness made from pieces of sling.

===Safety===
In a study conducted, researchers came to a conclusion that there was no statistically significant evidence revealing a pattern between harness type and severity of climbing accidents. Direct rock contact in rock climbing was the main reason for injury, not the type of climbing harness used.

==Materials==
Most harnesses are made from nylon webbing, specifically, Nylon 66. Aspects are often tubular rather than flat. Different weaves are used depending on a component&#x27;s function. These sometimes include polyester. Buckles are typically made of anodized aluminum. Foam and mesh are integrated into the leg loops and waist belt to make them more comfortable. Harness designers adapt increasingly advanced materials such as Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE), aramid fibers (Kevlar, Vectran, etc.), and sailcloth to make harnesses lighter and more comfortable.

<doc id="216087" wikidata="Q726151" url="?curid=216087" title="Quokka">
<text>The quokka () (Setonix brachyurus) is a small macropod about the size of a domestic cat. It is the only member of the genus Setonix. Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as kangaroos and wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal.

The quokka&#x27;s range is a small area of southwestern Australia. They inhabit some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, particularly Rottnest Island just off Perth and Bald Island near Albany. Isolated, scattered populations also exist in forest and coastal heath between Perth and Albany. A small colony inhabits a protected area of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, where they co-exist with the critically endangered Gilbert&#x27;s potoroo.

== Description ==
A quokka weighs and is long with a tail, which is quite short for a macropod. It has a stocky build, well developed hind legs, rounded ears, and a short, broad head. Although looking rather like a very small kangaroo, it can climb small trees and shrubs up to . Its coarse fur is a grizzled brown colour, fading to buff underneath. The quokka is known to live for an average of 10 years. Quokkas are nocturnal animals; they sleep during the day in &quot;Acanthocarpus preissii,&quot; using the plants&#x27; spikes for protection and hiding.

Quokkas have a promiscuous mating system. After a month of gestation, females give birth to a single baby called a joey. Females can give birth twice a year and produce about 17 joeys during their lifespan. The joey lives in its mother&#x27;s pouch for six months. Once it leaves the pouch, the joey relies on its mother for milk for two more months and is fully weaned around eight months after birth. Females sexually mature after roughly 18 months. When a female quokka with a joey in her pouch is pursued by a predator, she may drop her baby onto the ground; the joey produces noises which may serve to attract the predator&#x27;s attention, while the mother escapes.

== Discovery and name ==

The word &quot;quokka&quot; is originally derived from a Noongar word, which was probably . Today, the Noongar people refer to them as ban-gup, bungeup and quak-a.

In 1658, Dutch mariner Samuel Volckertszoon wrote of sighting &quot;a wild cat&quot; on the island. In 1696, Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh mistook them for giant rats, and renamed the Wadjemup island , which means &quot;the rat nest island&quot; in Dutch. Vlamingh had originally described them &quot;as a kind of rat as big as a common cat&quot;.

== Ecology ==
On the mainland, quokkas prefer areas with more vegetation, both for a wider variety of food and also for cover from predators such as dingoes, red foxes, and feral cats. In the wild, the quokka&#x27;s range is restricted to a very small range in the South West of Western Australia, with a number of small scattered populations. One large population exists on Rottnest Island and a smaller population is on Bald Island near Albany. These islands are free of the aforementioned predators. On Rottnest, quokkas are common and occupy a variety of habitats, ranging from semiarid scrub to cultivated gardens.
Prickly &quot;Acanthocarpus&quot; plants, which are unaccommodating for humans and other relatively large animals to walk through, provide their favourite daytime shelter for sleeping. Additionally, they are known for their ability to climb trees.

== Diet ==
Like most macropods, quokkas eat many types of vegetation, including grasses, sedges and leaves. A study found that &quot;Guichenotia ledifolia&quot;, a small shrub species of the family Malvaceae, is one of the quokka&#x27;s favoured foods. Rottnest Island visitors are urged to never feed quokkas, in part because eating &quot;human food&quot; such as chips can cause dehydration and malnourishment, both of which are detrimental to the quokka&#x27;s health. Despite the relative lack of fresh water on Rottnest Island, quokkas do have high water requirements, which they satisfy mostly through eating vegetation. On the mainland, quokkas only live in areas that have or more of rain per year. The quokkas chew their cud, similar to cows.

== Population ==

At the time of colonial settlement, the quokka was widespread and abundant, with its distribution encompassing an area of about of the South West of Western Australia, including the two offshore islands, Bald and Rottnest. By 1992, following extensive population declines in the 20th century, the quokka&#x27;s distribution on the mainland had been reduced by more than 50% to an area of about .

Despite being numerous on the small, offshore islands, the quokka is classified as vulnerable. On the mainland, where it is threatened by introduced predatory species such as red foxes, cats, and dogs, it requires dense ground cover for refuge. Clearfell logging, agricultural development, and housing expansion have reduced their habitat, contributing to the decline of the species, as has the clearing and burning of the remaining swamplands. Moreover, quokkas usually have a litter size of one and successfully rear one young each year. Although they are constantly mating, usually one day after the young are born, the small litter size, along with the restricted space and threatening predators, contributes to the scarcity of the species on the mainland.

An estimated 4,000 quokkas live on the mainland, with nearly all mainland populations being groups of fewer than 50, although one declining group of over 700 occurs in the southern forest between Nannup and Denmark. In 2015, an extensive bushfire near Northcliffe nearly eradicated one of the local mainland populations, with an estimated 90% of the 500 quokkas dying.

In 2007, the quokka population on Rottnest Island was estimated at between 8,000 and 12,000. Snakes are the quokka&#x27;s only predator on the island. The population on smaller Bald Island, where the quokka has no predators, is 600–1,000. At the end of summer and into autumn, a seasonal decline of quokkas occurs on Rottnest Island, where loss of vegetation and reduction of available surface water can lead to starvation.

This species saw the most significant decline from 1930 to the 1990s, when their distribution was reduced by over half. The quokka markedly declined in its abundance and distribution in the early 1930s, and this tendency has continued till today. Their presence on the mainland has declined to such an extent that they are only found in small groups in bushland surrounding Perth.

In late 2024 a new quokka population was discovered in the Perth Hills. It is the first time that quokkas have been photographed by the general public in the Perth Hills and is an important finding for conservation of the species. Their exact location will remain confidential.

The quokka is now listed as vulnerable in accordance with the IUCN criteria.

== Conservation ==
The quokka, while not in complete danger of going extinct, are considered threatened. As the climate continues to change so does the Australian landscape; being herbivores, the quokka rely on many native plants for their diet as well as protection. The quokka were found to prefer malvaceae species as a main source of food, using shrubs as shelter during the hottest points of the day. Due to factors such as wildfires and anthropogenic influence, the location of the natural flora has been changing making it harder for them to access. Invasive species and environmental changes are the primary threats to quokkas. A study found that the mainland populations prefer to live in areas with an average rainfall that exceeded 700 mm but fell below 1000 mm, which becomes increasingly complicated as aridity continues to increase in South west Australia. Increasing temperatures have also been found to play an important role in the distribution of the quokka as the mean annual temperatures have increased exponentially since the 1970s in South West of Western Australia. With climate change limiting the optimal living conditions of the quokka and changing the abundance of their diet, the quokka are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of threatened species. The increasing risk of severe bushfires presents a serious risk to quokkas, as quokka populations have a slow recovery rate after bushfires and take a long time to recolonise intensely burnt landscapes.

== Human interaction ==
Quokkas have little fear of humans and commonly approach people closely, particularly on Rottnest Island, where they are abundant. Although quokkas are approachable, there are a few dozen cases annually of quokkas biting people, especially children.

There are restrictions regarding feeding and handling. It is illegal for members of the public to handle the animals in any way, and feeding, particularly of &quot;human food&quot;, is especially discouraged, as they can easily get sick. An infringement notice carrying a $300 fine can be issued by the Rottnest Island Authority for such an offence, and arrests and detention can be made by Rottnest Island Police. The maximum penalty for animal cruelty is a $50,000 fine and a five-year prison sentence.

In addition to restrictions on human interactions with quokkas, they have been tested to be potentially harmful to humans with their high salmonella infection rates, especially in the summer heat. This has been proven and 
experimented by scientists who have taken blood tests on wild quokkas on Rottnest Island.

Quokkas can also be observed at several zoos and wildlife parks around Australia, including Perth Zoo, Taronga Zoo, Wild Life Sydney, Australia Zoo, 
Adelaide Zoo, and Caversham Wildlife Park. Physical interaction is generally not permitted without explicit permission from supervising staff.

Quokka behaviour in response to human interaction has been examined in zoo environments. One brief study indicated fewer animals remained visible from the visitor paths when the enclosure was an open or walk-through environment. This may have been due to the quokkas acquiring avoidance behaviour of visitors, which the authors propose has implications for stress management in their exhibition to the public.

== Quokka selfies ==
In the mid-2010s, quokkas earned a reputation on the internet as &quot;the world&#x27;s happiest animals&quot; and symbols of positivity, as frontal photos of their faces make them appear to be smiling (they do not, in fact &quot;smile&quot; in the human sense; this can be attributed to their natural facial structures). Many photos of smiling quokkas have since gone viral, and the &quot;quokka selfie&quot; has become a popular social media trend, with celebrities such as Chris Hemsworth, Shawn Mendes, Margot Robbie, Roger Federer and Kim Donghyuk of iKON taking part in the activity. Tourist numbers to Rottnest Island have subsequently increased.

<text>Candy Land is a simple racing board game created by Eleanor Abbott and published by Milton Bradley in 1949. The game requires no reading and minimal counting skills, making it suitable for young children. No strategy is involved as players are never required to make choices; only following directions is required. Over 50 million copies of Candy Land have been sold.

==History==
The game was designed in 1948 by Eleanor Abbott, while she was recovering from polio in San Diego, California. The game was made for and tested by the children in the same wards on the hospital. The children suggested that Abbott submit the game to Milton Bradley Company. The game was bought by Milton Bradley and first published in 1949 as a temporary fill-in for their then main product line, school supplies. &quot;Candy Land&quot; became Milton Bradley&#x27;s best-selling game, surpassing its previous top seller, Uncle Wiggily, and put the company in the same league as its main competitor, Parker Brothers. The original art has been purported to be by Abbott, although this is uncertain.

In 1984, Hasbro purchased Milton Bradley. Landmark Entertainment Group revamped the game with new art that same year, adding characters and a storyline.

Hasbro produces several versions of the game and treats it as a brand. For example, it markets &quot;Candy Land&quot; puzzles, a travel version, a personal computer game, and a handheld electronic version.

&quot;Candy Land&quot; was involved in one of the first disputes over Internet domain names in 1996. An adult web content provider registered candyland.com, and Hasbro objected. Hasbro obtained an injunction against the use.

In 2012, Hasbro announced a film, which triggered a lawsuit by Landmark Entertainment Group over ownership and royalties owed for the characters and storyline introduced in the 1984 edition. There was another film in 2005, called Candy Land: The Great Lollipop Adventure.

==Gameplay==

The race is woven around a storyline about finding King Kandy, the lost king of Candy Land. The board consists of a winding, linear track made of 134 spaces, most red, green, blue, yellow, orange, or purple. The remaining pink spaces are named locations, such as Candy Cane Forest and Gumdrop Mountain, or characters, such as Queen Frostine and Gramma Nutt.

Players take turns removing the top card from a stack, most of which show one of six colors, and then moving their marker ahead to the next space of that color. Some cards have two marks of a color, in which case the player moves the marker ahead to the second-next space of that color. The deck has one card for each named location, and drawing such a card moves a player directly to that board location. This move can be either forward or backward in the classic game. Backward moves can be ignored for younger players in the 2004 version of the game.

Prior to the 2006 edition, the board had three colored spaces marked with a dot. A player who lands on such a space must remain there and continue to draw one card per turn, but may not move ahead until they draw a card with the same color as that space. In the 2006 version, dot spaces were replaced with licorice spaces that cause the player landing on it simply to lose the next turn. Two shortcut paths are marked on the board; if a player lands on the space at the start of a shortcut, they may move directly to its end.

The game is won by landing on or passing the final square and thus reaching the goal of the Candy Castle. In the original version, that final square is purple, but the official rules specify that any card that would cause the player to advance past the last square wins the game. Many people, however, play with a rule that one must land exactly on the last square to win. The 2004 version changed the last space to rainbow color, meaning it applies to any color drawn by a player, which renders the rule superfluous.

, &quot;Candy Land&quot; is being sold by Hasbro with a spinner instead of cards. The spinner includes all outcomes that were previously on the cards.

==Versions==

At least four versions of the &quot;Candy Land&quot; board game were made. The first dates from 1949. This version, and other early versions, had only locations (Molasses Swamp, Gumdrop Mountains, etc.) and no characters. A board copyrighted in 1962 shows a track layout different from the more recent versions.

In the first edition, the pawns were wooden, but they were changed in the 1967 version to plastic gingerbread men.

The 1984 edition introduced a storyline and characters such as Mr. Mint and Gramma Nutt. It has the modern track layout and ends with a purple square.

Some of the characters and place names were changed in 2002. Queen Frostine became &quot;Princess&quot; Frostine, the classic Molasses Swamp was changed to Chocolate Swamp, Princess Lolly was changed to Lolly, and the character Plumpy was removed entirely.

A VCR board game version was released in 1986. Hasbro released an electronic version of the game for Windows in 1998. An animated feature, &quot;Candy Land: The Great Lollipop Adventure&quot;, was produced in 2005 and later spawned a DVD game version of &quot;Candy Land&quot;.

The &quot;Give Kids the World: Village edition&quot; of &quot;Candy Land&quot; was produced by Hasbro especially for the Give Kids The World Village, a non-profit resort in Kissimmee, Florida for children with life-threatening illnesses and their families. Traditional &quot;Candy Land&quot; characters and locations were replaced with the venues and characters of the Village, such as Mayor Clayton and Ms. Merry.

There are licensed versions of &quot;Candy Land&quot; with characters such as Winnie the Pooh, Dora the Explorer, and SpongeBob.
== Characters ==
Characters depend on the version of the game.
* The Kids – In the classic version, they are two blonde twins. In 2002, there are four kids of varying races. In the 2013 edition, they are a marshmallow, an ice cream cone, a gumdrop, and a gingerbread girl.
* Mr. Mint – He lives in the Candycane Forest, and is a candy cane &quot;woodcutter&quot;. He was removed from World of Sweets and then brought back for the 2013 version as an ice skater instead of a woodcutter. 
* Duke of Swirl – Mr. Mint&#x27;s replacement in the 2010 edition.
* Gramma Nutt – Gramma Nutt lives in a peanut brittle house on the corner of Candy Land. Renamed Nana in the 2014 edition.
** Bazz - the dog and official pet of Gramma Nutt in the 2002 edition.
* King Kandy – the king of Candy Land. He lives in a castle made of sweets.
* Jolly – A happy chubby monster representing gumdrops. He was removed in the 2010 version and then after widespread outcry and demand was brought back for the 2013 edition; however, he was once again removed in the 2014 edition.
* Plumpy – A fuzzy green monster under the gingerbread plum tree. He was removed in the 2002 version and replaced by Mamma Ginger Tree.
* Mamma Ginger Tree – Makes the best gingersnaps in all of Candy Land. She was removed from the game.
* Cupcake Commons – Mamma Ginger Tree&#x27;s replacement in the 2010 version.
* Princess Lolly – A friendly fairy-princess who occupies the Lollipop Woods and is King Kandy&#x27;s daughter. She was renamed &#x27;Lolly&#x27; after the 2002 edition and later renamed Princess Lolly in the 2010 and 2014 editions.

==Legacy==

===Motif===
The Candy section of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us in New York City&#x27;s Times Square maintained a &quot;Candy Land&quot; theme until losing its license for the characters in 2006. The theme included a colored pathway that mimicked the board for the game, several &quot;Candy Land&quot; characters, and candy-themed shelving and ceiling decorations.

=== Comic book ===
&quot;Candy Land&quot; was one of several Hasbro properties featured in the 2011 one-shot comic book &quot;Unit: E&quot;, which attempted to revamp and tie together several of Hasbro&#x27;s dormant properties. Princess Lolly is seen in one page, with Synergy (from &quot;Jem&quot;), the son of Acroyear and his servant Biotron (both from &quot;Micronauts&quot;) discussing her and other fairies that have crossed over from their land onto Earth more than once. Synergy believes the creatures of Primordia (an attempted reworking of &quot;Inhumanoids&quot;) may have been the result of someone angering the fairies in the past, though she admits she&#x27;s uncertain if this is in fact the case.

===Film===

An animated feature, &quot;Candy Land: The Great Lollipop Adventure&quot;, was released in 2005. It was dedicated to Eleanor Abbott, creator of the game, who died before the film came out.

====Planned====
In February 2009, Universal Pictures announced plans for a film based on the &quot;Candy Land&quot; board game. Etan Cohen, a writer for comedies like &quot;&quot; and &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;, was hired to write the screenplay. Kevin Lima, who directed &quot;Enchanted&quot;, was set to direct. However, in 2011, a new screenwriting team was designated, composed of Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger. They said, &quot;We don&#x27;t see it as a movie based on a board game, although it has characters from that world and takes the idea of people finding themselves in a world that happens to be made entirely of candy where there are huge battles going on. We are going for real comedy, real action, and real emotions at stake.&quot;

By January 2012 Columbia Pictures, Happy Madison, and Adam Sandler were in final negotiations to develop the film, with Sandler both starring and co-writing the screenplay with Robert Smigel. In July 2014, a lawsuit by Landmark Entertainment Group took place over ownership and royalties owned for the characters and storyline introduced in the 1984 edition.

===Television adaptation===
A cooking competition show, which was based on the game and hosted by Kristin Chenoweth, premiered on Food Network on November 15, 2020. Teams of dessert chefs competed over six weeks for a $25,000 grand prize.

==Reception==
The Toy Industry Association named &quot;Candy Land&quot; as the most popular toy in the US in the 1940s. In 2005, the game was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong Museum in Rochester, New York. About one million copies per year are sold.

<text>The House of Commons is the name for the elected lower house of the bicameral parliaments of the United Kingdom and Canada. In both of these countries, the Commons holds much more legislative power than the nominally upper house of parliament. The leader of the majority party in the House of Commons by convention becomes the prime minister. Other parliaments have also had a lower house called the &quot;House of Commons&quot;.

==History and naming==

The House of Commons of the Kingdom of England evolved from an undivided parliament to serve as the voice of the tax-paying subjects of the counties and the boroughs. Knights of the shire, elected from each county, were usually landowners, while the borough members were often from the merchant classes. These members represented subjects of the Crown who were not Lords Temporal or Spiritual, who themselves sat in the House of Lords. The House of Commons gained its name because it represented communities (&quot;communes&quot;). 

From the Middle Ages until the early 20th century the suffrage was limited in various ways, typically to some male property-owners; in 1780 just 3% of the population could vote. Since the 19th century, the British and Canadian Houses of Commons have become increasingly representative (see Reform Acts), as suffrage has been extended. Both bodies are now elected via universal adult suffrage.

<doc id="216096" wikidata="Q874349" url="?curid=216096" title="Jericho (missile)">
<text>Jericho () is a general designation given to a loosely-related family of deployed ballistic missiles developed by Israel since the 1960s. The name is taken from the first development contract for the Jericho I signed between Israel and Dassault in 1963, with the codename as a reference to the Biblical city of Jericho. As with some other Israeli high tech weapons systems, exact details are classified, though there are observed test data, public statements by government officials, and details in open literature especially about the Shavit satellite launch vehicle.

The later Jericho family development is related to the Shavit and Shavit II space launch vehicles believed to be derivatives of the Jericho II IRBM and that preceded the development of the Jericho III ICBM. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US concluded that the Shavit could be adapted as an ICBM carrying a 500 kg warhead over 7,500 km. Additional insight into the Jericho program was revealed by the South African series of missiles, of which the RSA-3 are believed to be licensed copies of the Jericho II/Shavit, and the RSA-4 that used part of these systems in their stack with a heavy first stage. Subsequent to the declaration and disarming of the South African nuclear program, the RSA series missiles were offered commercially as satellite launch vehicles, resulting in the advertised specifications becoming public knowledge.

The civilian space launch version of the Jericho, the Shavit, was studied in an air launched version piggybacked on a Boeing 747 similar to a U.S. experimental launch of the Minuteman ICBM from a C-5 Galaxy.

== Jericho I ==
Jericho I was first publicly identified being an operational short-range ballistic missile system in late 1971. It was long, in diameter, weighing . It had a range of and a CEP of , and it could carry a payload estimated at . It was intended to carry a nuclear warhead. Due to Israel&#x27;s ambiguity over its nuclear weapons program, the missile is classified as a ballistic missile. Initial development was in conjunction with France, Dassault provided various missile systems from 1963 and a type designated MD-620 was test fired in 1965. French co-operation was halted by an arms embargo in January 1968, though 12 missiles had been delivered from France. Work was continued by IAI at the Beit Zachariah facility and the program cost almost $1 billion up to 1980, incorporating some U.S. technology. Despite some initial problems with its guidance systems, it is believed that around 100 missiles of this type were produced.

In 1969, Israel agreed with the United States that Jericho missiles would not be used as &quot;strategic missiles&quot;, with nuclear warheads, until at least 1972.

During the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, with the initial surprise breakthroughs on both northern and southern borders by Arab armies, the alarmed Defense Minister Moshe Dayan told Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir that &quot;this is the end of the third temple.&quot; He was warning of Israel&#x27;s impending total defeat, but &quot;Temple&quot; was also the code word for nuclear weapons. Dayan again raised the nuclear topic in a cabinet meeting, warning that the country was approaching a point of &quot;last resort&quot;. That night Meir authorized the assembly of thirteen nuclear weapon &quot;physics packages&quot; to arm Jericho I missiles at Sdot Micha Airbase, and F-4 aircraft at Tel Nof Airbase, for use against Syrian and Egyptian targets. The range on the Jericho 1 is sufficient to strike major cities such as Damascus and Cairo from secured launch locations. They would be used if absolutely necessary to prevent total defeat, but the preparation was done in an easily detectable way, likely as a signal to the US. U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger learned of the nuclear alert on the morning of October 9. That day, in keeping with his deal and warning that prevented a preemptive Israeli attack on gathering Arab armies, President Nixon ordered the commencement of Operation Nickel Grass, a U.S. airlift to replace all of Israel&#x27;s material losses. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Kissinger told Sadat that the reason for the U.S. airlift was that the Israelis were close to &quot;going nuclear&quot;.

It is believed that all Jericho 1 missiles were taken out of service in the 1990s and replaced with the longer-range Jericho 2. The Jericho 1 missiles were housed in Zekharia, located southeast of Tel Aviv and stationed in caves.

== Jericho II ==

The Jericho II (YA-3) is a solid fuel, two-stage intermediate-range ballistic missile system and a follow on from the Jericho I project. As many as 90 Jericho 2 missiles are currently based in caves near Zekharia (Sdot Micha Airbase), southeast of Tel Aviv.

A request from Israel for 1,100 mile (1,770 km) range Pershing II medium range ballistic missiles was rejected by the United States for inclusion as part of a military assistance incentive package offered in 1975 during negotiations over transferring the Sinai from Israeli to Egyptian control as part of a US-brokered peace deal. Jericho II development began in 1977, and by 1986 there were reports of test firings. According to Missilethreat, a project of the George C. Marshall Institute, there is evidence the Jericho II originated as a joint Israeli-Iranian project, cooperation that ended with the loss of friendly relations after the 1979 Iranian Revolution overthrew the Shah&#x27;s rule. There was a series of test launches into the Mediterranean from 1987 to 1992, the longest at around 1,300 km, mostly from the facility at Palmachim, south of Tel Aviv. Jane&#x27;s reports that a test launch of 1,400 km is believed to have taken place from South Africa&#x27;s Overberg Test Range in June 1989.

The Jericho II is 14.0 m long and 1.56 m wide, with a reported launch weight of 26,000 kg (although an alternative launch weight of 21,935 kg has been suggested). It has a 1,000 kg payload, capable of carrying a considerable amount of high explosives or a 1 Megaton yield nuclear warhead. It uses a two-stage solid propellant engine with a separating warhead. The missile can be launched from a silo, a railroad flat car, or a mobile vehicle. This gives it the ability to be hidden, moved quickly, or kept in a hardened silo, largely ensuring survival against any attack. It has an active radar homing terminal guidance system similar to that of the Pershing II, for very accurate strikes.

The Jericho II forms the basis of the three-stage, 23 ton Shavit NEXT satellite launcher, first launched in 1988 from Palmachim. From the performance of Shavit it has been estimated that as a ballistic missile it has a maximum range of about 7,800 km with a 500 kg payload.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSIS-2000/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jericho II as an available Israeli counterattack option to Iraqi missile bombardment in the 1991 Gulf War is disputed. Jane&#x27;s at the time believed that Jericho II entered service in 1989. Researcher Seth Carus claims that, according to an Israeli source, the decision to operationally deploy the Jericho-2 was only made after 1994, several years after the Scud attacks had ended and a cease fire and disarmament regime were in place. Raytheon Technologies, quoting Soviet intelligence archives, showed them believing the Jericho-2 to have been fully developed weapon in 1989, but did not indicate when it was available for deployment. Investigators for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace accessed commercial satellite images of the Sdot Micha Airbase near Zachariah, a suspected Jericho missile base, comparison shows expansion between 1989 and 1993 of the type that would accommodate suspected Jericho II launchers and missiles. Such an expansion would be more consistent with a post-1991 deployment chronology.

== Jericho III ==
It is believed that the Jericho III (YA-4) is a nuclear-armed ICBM that entered service in 2011. The Jericho III is believed to have two or three-stages, using solid propellant and having a payload of 1,000 to 1,300 kg. The payload could be a single 750 kg (150–400 kiloton) nuclear warhead or two or three low-yield MIRV warheads. It has an estimated launch weight of 30,000 kg and a length of 15.5 m with a width of 1.56 m. It may be similar to an upgraded and re-designed Shavit space launch vehicle, produced by Israel Aerospace Industries. It probably has longer first and second-stage motors. It is estimated by missilethreat.com that it has a range of 4,800 to 6,500 km (2,982 to 4,038 miles), though a 2004 missile proliferation survey by the Congressional Research Service put its possible maximum range at 11,500 km (missile range is inversely proportional to payload mass).

According to an official report that was submitted to the U.S. Congress in 2004, it may be that with a payload of 1,000 kg the Jericho III gives Israel nuclear strike capabilities within the entire Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia and almost all parts of North America, as well as large parts of South America and North Oceania. Missile Threat reports: &quot;The range of the Jericho 3 also provides an extremely high impact speed for nearby targets, enabling it to avoid any Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) defenses that may develop in the immediate region.&quot; On 17 January 2008 Israel test fired a multi-stage ballistic missile believed to be of the Jericho III type, reportedly capable of carrying &quot;conventional or non conventional warheads.&quot; On 2 November 2011, Israel successfully test fired a missile believed to be an upgraded version of the Jericho III from Palmachim; the long trail of smoke was seen throughout central Israel. Israel&#x27;s intercontinental ballistic missile launchers are believed to be buried so deeply that they would survive a first strike nuclear attack.

After a successful missile test launch conducted in early 2008, Israeli weapons expert General Itzhak Ben-Israel, former chairman of the Israeli Space Agency at the Ministry of Science, said &quot;Everybody can do the mathematics... we can reach with a rocket engine to every point in the world&quot;, thus appearing to confirm Israel&#x27;s new capability. Israeli Ministry of Defense officials said that the 2008 test launch represented a &quot;dramatic leap in Israel&#x27;s missile technologies&quot;.

After a further test in 2013 Alon Ben David published this opinion in an article in &quot;Aviation Week&quot; on the missile&#x27;s range and throw weight: &quot;Reportedly, Israel&#x27;s Jericho III intermediate-range ballistic missile is capable of carrying a 1,000 kg (2,204-lb.) warhead more than 5,000 km.&quot; Further tests conducted in July 2013 could have been for the Jericho 3 or possibly the Jericho 3A missile, a follow-up missile believed to have a new motor.

== Jericho IV ==
In 2019, a successful test launch was conducted by Israel of a rocket, which was subsequently referred to as the &quot;Jericho 4&quot; by Israeli mass media. Despite this designation, the specific distinctions between the Jericho 4 and its predecessor, the Jericho 3, remain undisclosed.
2024 article provides more details: &quot;... the Jericho 4, a three-stage missile, whose capabilities will include the possibility of carrying fragmentation warheads.&quot;

== South African RSA Series ==

The Jericho II/Shavit SLV was also license produced in the Republic of South Africa as the RSA series of space launch vehicles and ballistic missiles.

The RSA-3 was produced by the Houwteq (a discontinued division of Denel) company at Grabouw, 30 km east of Cape Town. Test launches were made from Overberg Test Range near Bredasdorp, 200 km east of Cape Town. Rooi Els was where the engine test facilities were located. Development continued even after South African renunciation of its nuclear weapons for use as a commercial satellite launcher. Development reached its height in 1992 a year after nuclear renunciation with 50–70 companies involved, employing 1300–1500 people from the public and private sector. A much heavier ICBM or space launch vehicle, the RSA-4, with a first stage in the Peacekeeper ICBM class but with Jericho-2/RSA-3 upper stage components was in development, the RSA-2 was a local copy of the Jericho II ballistic missile and the RSA-1 was a local copy of the Jericho II second stage for use as a mobile missile.

The missiles were to be based on the RSA-3 and RSA-4 launchers that had already been built and tested for the South African space programme. According to Al J Venter, author of &quot;How South Africa Built Six Atom Bombs&quot;, these missiles were incompatible with the available large South African nuclear warheads, he claims that the RSA series being designed for a 340 kg payload would suggest a warhead of some 200 kg, &quot;well beyond SA&#x27;s best efforts of the late 1980s.&quot; Venter&#x27;s analysis is that the RSA series was intended to display a credible delivery system combined with a separate nuclear test in a final diplomatic appeal to the world powers in an emergency even though they were never intended to be used in a weaponized system together. Three rockets had already been launched into suborbital trajectories in the late 1980s in support of development of the RSA-3 launched Greensat Orbital Management System (for commercial satellite applications of vehicle tracking and regional planning). Following the decision in 1989 to cancel the nuclear weapons program, the missile programs were allowed to continue until 1992, when military funding ended, and all ballistic missile work was stopped by mid-1993. In order to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, the government had to allow U.S. supervision of the destruction of key facilities applicable to both the long range missile and the space launch programmes.
In June 1994, the RSA-3 / RSA-4 South African satellite launcher program was cancelled.

<text>Antonio Fogazzaro (; 25 March 1842 – 7 March 1911) was an Italian novelist and proponent of Liberal Catholicism. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times.

==Biography==
Fogazzaro was born in Vicenza to a wealthy family. In 1864 he obtained a law degree in Turin. He then moved to Milan where he followed the &quot;scapigliatura&quot; movement. In 1869 he was back in Vicenza to work as lawyer, but he left this line of work very soon to be a full-time novelist.

He began his literary career with &quot;Miranda&quot;, a poetical romance (1874), followed in 1876 by &quot;Valsolda&quot;, which, republished in 1886 with considerable additions, constitutes perhaps his principal claim as a poet. His novels, &quot;Malombra&quot; (1882), &quot;Daniele Cortis&quot; (1887), &quot;Misterio del Poeta&quot; (1888), obtained considerable literary success upon their first publication, but did not gain universal popularity until they were discovered and taken up by French critics in 1896.

In Fogazzaro&#x27;s work there is a constant conflict between sense of duty and passions, faith and reason. In some cases this brings the tormented soul of characters into mystic experiences. His most popular novel, &quot;Piccolo Mondo Antico&quot; (variously titled in English as &quot;The Patriot&quot; or &quot;The Little World of the Past&quot;). The novel is set in the 1850s in Valsolda, a small community on the shores of Lake Lugano where he spent most of his life. &quot;Piccolo Mondo Antico&quot; has delightful evocations of the landscape, and strong characterizations which reveal the inner psychological turmoil of the characters.

Fogazzaro toured Italy proposing to reconcile Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution with Christianity. He found new interpretations in positivist and evolutionist theories. The Roman Catholic Church banned his novels &quot;Il Santo&quot; (1905) in April 1906 and &quot;Leila&quot; (1910) in May 1911. He died in 1911 in his birthplace, Vicenza.

<text>Genetically modified foods (GM foods), also known as genetically engineered foods (GE foods), or bioengineered foods are foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using various methods of genetic engineering. Genetic engineering techniques allow for the introduction of new traits as well as greater control over traits when compared to previous methods, such as selective breeding and mutation breeding. 

The discovery of DNA and the improvement of genetic technology in the 20th century played a crucial role in the development of transgenic technology. In 1988, genetically modified microbial enzymes were first approved for use in food manufacture. Recombinant rennet was used in few countries in the 1990s. Commercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994, when Calgene first marketed its unsuccessful Flavr Savr delayed-ripening tomato. Most food modifications have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean, maize/corn, canola, and cotton. Genetically modified crops have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and for better nutrient profiles. The production of golden rice in 2000 marked a further improvement in the nutritional value of genetically modified food. GM livestock have been developed, although, , none were on the market. As of 2015, the AquAdvantage salmon was the only animal approved for commercial production, sale and consumption by the FDA. It is the first genetically modified animal to be approved for human consumption.

Genes encoded for desired features, for instance an improved nutrient level, pesticide and herbicide resistances, and the possession of therapeutic substances, are often extracted and transferred to the target organisms, providing them with superior survival and production capacity. The improved utilization value usually gave consumers benefit in specific aspects like taste, appearance, or size.

There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation, which varied due to geographical, religious, social, and other factors. 

==Definition==
Genetically modified foods are foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering as opposed to traditional cross breeding. In the U.S., the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) favor the use of the term &quot;genetic engineering&quot; over &quot;genetic modification&quot; as being more precise; the USDA defines &quot;genetic modification&quot; to include &quot;genetic engineering or other more traditional methods&quot;.

According to the World Health Organization, &quot;Foods produced from or using GM organisms are often referred to as GM foods.&quot;

What constitutes a genetically modified organism (GMO) is not clear and varies widely between countries, international bodies and other communities, has changed significantly over time, and was subject to numerous exceptions based on &quot;convention&quot;, such as exclusion of mutation breeding from the EU definition.

Even greater inconsistency and confusion is associated with various &quot;Non-GMO&quot; or &quot;GMO-free&quot; labelling schemes in food marketing, where even products such as water or salt, that do not contain any organic substances and genetic material (and thus cannot be genetically modified by definition) are being labelled to create an impression of being &quot;more healthy.&quot;

==History==
Human-directed genetic manipulation of food began with the domestication of plants and animals through artificial selection at about 10,500 to 10,100 BC. The process of selective breeding, in which organisms with desired traits (and thus with the desired genes) are used to breed the next generation and organisms lacking the trait are not bred, is a precursor to the modern concept of genetic modification (GM). With the discovery of DNA in the early 1900s and various advancements in genetic techniques through the 1970s it became possible to directly alter the DNA and genes within food.

Genetically modified microbial enzymes were the first application of genetically modified organisms in food production and were approved in 1988 by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the early 1990s, recombinant chymosin was approved for use in several countries. Cheese had typically been made using the enzyme complex rennet that had been extracted from cows&#x27; stomach lining. Scientists modified bacteria to produce chymosin, which was also able to clot milk, resulting in cheese curds.

The first genetically modified food approved for release was the Flavr Savr tomato in 1994. Developed by Calgene, it was engineered to have a longer shelf life by inserting an antisense gene that delayed ripening. China was the first country to commercialize a transgenic crop in 1993 with the introduction of virus-resistant tobacco. In 1995, &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (Bt) Potato was approved for cultivation, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the US. Other genetically modified crops receiving marketing approval in 1995 were: canola with modified oil composition, Bt maize/corn, cotton resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, Bt cotton, glyphosate-tolerant soybeans, virus-resistant squash, and another delayed ripening tomato.

With the creation of golden rice in 2000, scientists had genetically modified food to increase its nutrient value for the first time.

By 2010, 29 countries had planted commercialized biotech crops and a further 31 countries had granted regulatory approval for transgenic crops to be imported. The US was the leading country in the production of GM foods in 2011, with twenty-five GM crops having received regulatory approval. In 2015, 92% of corn, 94% of soybeans, and 94% of cotton produced in the US were genetically modified varieties.

The first genetically modified animal to be approved for food use was AquAdvantage salmon in 2015. The salmon were transformed with a growth hormone-regulating gene from a Pacific Chinook salmon and a promoter from an ocean pout enabling it to grow year-round instead of only during spring and summer.

A GM white button mushroom (&quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot;) has been approved in the United States since 2016. See §Mushroom below.

The most widely planted GMOs are designed to tolerate herbicides. The use of herbicides presents a strong selection pressure on treated weeds to gain resistance to the herbicide. Widespread planting of GM crops resistant to glyphosate has led to the use of glyphosate to control weeds and many weed species, such as Palmer amaranth, acquiring resistance to the herbicide.

In 2021, the first CRISPR-edited food has gone on public sale in Japan. Tomatoes were genetically modified for around five times the normal amount of possibly calming GABA. CRISPR was first applied in tomatoes in 2014. Shortly afterwards, the first CRISPR-gene-edited marine animal/seafood and second set of CRISPR-edited food has gone on public sale in Japan: two fish of which one species grows to twice the size of natural specimens due to disruption of leptin, which controls appetite, and the other grows to 1.2 the natural average size with the same amount of food due to disabled myostatin, which inhibits muscle growth.

==Process==

Creating genetically modified food is a multi-step process. The first step is to identify a useful gene from another organism that you would like to add. The gene can be taken from a cell or artificially synthesised, and then combined with other genetic elements, including a promoter and terminator region and a selectable marker. Then the genetic elements are inserted into the targets genome. DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection, where it can be injected through the cell&#x27;s nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus, or through the use of viral vectors. In plants the DNA is often inserted using &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-mediated recombination, biolistics or electroporation. As only a single cell is transformed with genetic material, the organism must be regenerated from that single cell. In plants this is accomplished through tissue culture. In animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in the embryonic stem cells. Further testing using PCR, Southern hybridization, and DNA sequencing is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene.

Traditionally the new genetic material was inserted randomly within the host genome. Gene targeting techniques, which creates double-stranded breaks and takes advantage on the cells natural homologous recombination repair systems, have been developed to target insertion to exact locations. Genome editing uses artificially engineered nucleases that create breaks at specific points. There are four families of engineered nucleases: meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the Cas9-guideRNA system (adapted from CRISPR). TALEN and CRISPR are the two most commonly used and each has its own advantages. TALENs have greater target specificity, while CRISPR is easier to design and more efficient.

=== Crops ===
Genetically modified crops (GM crops) are genetically modified plants that are used in agriculture. The first crops developed were used for animal or human food and provide resistance to certain pests, diseases, environmental conditions, spoilage or chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a herbicide). The second generation of crops aimed to improve the quality, often by altering the nutrient profile. Third generation genetically modified crops could be used for non-food purposes, including the production of pharmaceutical agents, biofuels, and other industrially useful goods, as well as for bioremediation. GM crops have been produced to improve harvests through reducing insect pressure, increase nutrient value and tolerate different abiotic stresses. As of 2018, the commercialised crops are limited mostly to cash crops like cotton, soybean, maize/corn and canola and the vast majority of the introduced traits provide either herbicide tolerance or insect resistance.

The majority of GM crops have been modified to be resistant to selected herbicides, usually a glyphosate or glufosinate based one. Genetically modified crops engineered to resist herbicides are now more available than conventionally bred resistant varieties. Most currently available genes used to engineer insect resistance come from the &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (Bt) bacterium and code for delta endotoxins. A few use the genes that encode for vegetative insecticidal proteins. The only gene commercially used to provide insect protection that does not originate from &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot; is the Cowpea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI was first approved for use cotton in 1999 and is currently undergoing trials in rice. Less than one percent of GM crops contained other traits, which include providing virus resistance, delaying senescence and altering the plants composition.

Adoption by farmers has been rapid, between 1996 and 2013, the total surface area of land cultivated with GM crops increased by a factor of 100. Geographically though the spread has been uneven, with strong growth in the Americas and parts of Asia and little in Europe and Africa in 2013 only 10% of world cropland was GM, with the US, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina being 90% of that. Its socioeconomic spread has been more even, with approximately 54% of worldwide GM crops grown in developing countries in 2013. Although doubts have been raised, most studies have found growing GM crops to be beneficial to farmers through decreased pesticide use as well as increased crop yield and farm profit.

===Fruits and vegetables===
Long before humans began using transgenics, sweet potato emerged naturally 8000 years ago by embedding of genes from bacteria, that increased its sugar content. Kyndt et al 2015 finds &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; DNA from this natural transgenic event still in the crop&#x27;s genome today.
Papaya was genetically modified to resist the ringspot virus (PSRV). &quot;SunUp&quot; is a transgenic red-fleshed Sunset papaya cultivar that is homozygous for the coat protein gene PRSV; &quot;Rainbow&quot; is a yellow-fleshed F1 hybrid developed by crossing &#x27;SunUp&#x27; and nontransgenic yellow-fleshed &quot;Kapoho&quot;. The GM cultivar was approved in 1998 and by 2010 80% of Hawaiian papaya was genetically engineered. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;without it, the state&#x27;s papaya industry would have collapsed&quot;. In China, a transgenic PRSV-resistant papaya was developed by South China Agricultural University and was first approved for commercial planting in 2006; as of 2012 95% of the papaya grown in Guangdong province and 40% of the papaya grown in Hainan province was genetically modified. In Hong Kong, where there is an exemption on growing and releasing any varieties of GM papaya, more than 80% of grown and imported papayas were transgenic.

The New Leaf potato, a GM food developed using &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (Bt), was made to provide in-plant protection from the yield-robbing Colorado potato beetle. The New Leaf potato, brought to market by Monsanto in the late 1990s, was developed for the fast food market. It was withdrawn in 2001 after retailers rejected it and food processors ran into export problems. In 2011, BASF requested the European Food Safety Authority&#x27;s approval for cultivation and marketing of its Fortuna potato as feed and food. The potato was made resistant to late blight by adding resistant genes blb1 and blb2 that originate from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum. In February 2013, BASF withdrew its application. In 2014, the USDA approved a genetically modified potato developed by J. R. Simplot Company that contained ten genetic modifications that prevent bruising and produce less acrylamide when fried. The modifications eliminate specific proteins from the potatoes, via RNA interference, rather than introducing novel proteins.

As of 2005, about 13% of the Zucchini grown in the US was genetically modified to resist three viruses; that variety is also grown in Canada.

In 2013, the USDA approved the import of a GM pineapple that is pink in color and that &quot;overexpresses&quot; a gene derived from tangerines and suppress other genes, increasing production of lycopene. The plant&#x27;s flowering cycle was changed to provide for more uniform growth and quality. The fruit &quot;does not have the ability to propagate and persist in the environment once they have been harvested&quot;, according to USDA APHIS. According to Del Monte&#x27;s submission, the pineapples are commercially grown in a &quot;monoculture&quot; that prevents seed production, as the plant&#x27;s flowers aren&#x27;t exposed to compatible pollen sources. Importation into Hawaii is banned for &quot;plant sanitation&quot; reasons. Del Monte launched sales of their pink pineapples in October 2020, marketed under the name &quot;Pinkglow&quot;.

In February 2015 Arctic Apples were approved by the USDA, becoming the first genetically modified apple approved for sale in the US. Gene silencing is used to reduce the expression of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), thus preventing the fruit from browning.

===Maize/corn===
Maize/corn used for food and ethanol has been genetically modified to tolerate various herbicides and to express a protein from &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (Bt) that kills certain insects. About 90% of the corn grown in the US was genetically modified in 2010. In the US in 2015, 81% of corn acreage contained the Bt trait and 89% of corn acreage contained the glyphosate-tolerant trait. Corn can be processed into grits, meal and flour as an ingredient in pancakes, muffins, doughnuts, breadings and batters, as well as baby foods, meat products, cereals and some fermented products. Corn-based masa flour and masa dough are used in the production of taco shells, corn chips and tortillas.

===Soy===
Soybeans accounted for half of all genetically modified crops planted in 2014. Genetically modified soybean has been modified to tolerate herbicides and produce healthier oils. In 2015, 94% of soybean acreage in the U.S. was genetically modified to be glyphosate-tolerant.

=== Rice ===

Golden rice is the most well known GM crop that is aimed at increasing nutrient value. It has been engineered with three genes that biosynthesise beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the edible parts of rice. It is intended to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary vitamin A, a deficiency which each year is estimated to kill 670,000 children under the age of 5 and cause an additional 500,000 cases of irreversible childhood blindness. The original golden rice produced 1.6μg/g of the carotenoids, with further development increasing this 23 times. In 2018 it gained its first approvals for use as food.

===Wheat===
As of December 2017, genetically modified wheat has been evaluated in field trials, but has not been released commercially.

===Mushroom===
In April 2016, a white button mushroom (&quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot;) modified using the CRISPR technique received &quot;de facto&quot; approval in the United States, after the USDA said it would not have to go through the agency&#x27;s regulatory process. The agency considers the mushroom exempt because the editing process did not involve the introduction of foreign DNA, rather several base pairs were deleted from a duplicated gene coding for an enzyme that causes browning causing a 30% reduction in the level of that enzyme.

===Livestock===
Genetically modified livestock are organisms from the group of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, birds, horses and fish kept for human consumption, whose genetic material (DNA) has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. In some cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait to the animals which does not occur naturally in the species, i.e. transgenesis.

A 2003 review published on behalf of Food Standards Australia New Zealand examined transgenic experimentation on terrestrial livestock species as well as aquatic species such as fish and shellfish. The review examined the molecular techniques used for experimentation as well as techniques for tracing the transgenes in animals and products as well as issues regarding transgene stability.

Some mammals typically used for food production have been modified to produce non-food products, a practice sometimes called Pharming.

====Salmon====
A GM salmon, awaiting regulatory approval since 1997, was approved for human consumption by the American FDA in November 2015, to be raised in specific land-based hatcheries in Canada and Panama.

===Microbes===
Bacteriophages are an economically significant cause of culture failure in cheese production. Various culture microbes - especially &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot; - have been studied for genetic analysis and modification to improve phage resistance. This has especially focused on plasmid and recombinant chromosomal modifications.

==Derivative products==
===Lecithin===
Lecithin is a naturally occurring lipid. It can be found in egg yolks and oil-producing plants. It is an emulsifier and thus is used in many foods. Corn, soy and safflower oil are sources of lecithin, though the majority of lecithin commercially available is derived from soy. Sufficiently processed lecithin is often undetectable with standard testing practices. According to the FDA, no evidence shows or suggests hazard to the public when lecithin is used at common levels. Lecithin added to foods amounts to only 2 to 10 percent of the 1 to 5 g of phosphoglycerides consumed daily on average. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about GM food extend to such products. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in Europe in 2000, when Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because of the difficulty of detecting the origin of derivatives like lecithin with current testing practices, European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to employ a comprehensive system of Identity preservation (IP).

===Sugar===
The US imports 10% of its sugar, while the remaining 90% is extracted from sugar beet and sugarcane. After deregulation in 2005, glyphosate-resistant sugar beet was extensively adopted in the United States. 95% of beet acres in the US were planted with glyphosate-resistant seed in 2011. GM sugar beets are approved for cultivation in the US, Canada and Japan; the vast majority are grown in the US. GM beets are approved for import and consumption in Australia, Canada, Colombia, EU, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, the Russian Federation and Singapore. Pulp from the refining process is used as animal feed. The sugar produced from GM sugar beets contains no DNA or protein – it is just sucrose that is chemically indistinguishable from sugar produced from non-GM sugar beets. Independent analyses conducted by internationally recognized laboratories found that sugar from Roundup Ready sugar beets is identical to the sugar from comparably grown conventional (non-Roundup Ready) sugar beets.

===Vegetable oil===
Most vegetable oil used in the US is produced from GM crops canola, maize/corn, cotton and soybeans. Vegetable oil is sold directly to consumers as cooking oil, shortening and margarine and is used in prepared foods. There is a vanishingly small amount of protein or DNA from the original crop in vegetable oil. Vegetable oil is made of triglycerides extracted from plants or seeds and then refined and may be further processed via hydrogenation to turn liquid oils into solids. The refining process removes all, or nearly all non-triglyceride ingredients.

==Other uses==
===Animal feed===
Livestock and poultry are raised on animal feed, much of which is composed of the leftovers from processing crops, including GM crops. For example, approximately 43% of a canola seed is oil. What remains after oil extraction is a meal that becomes an ingredient in animal feed and contains canola protein. Likewise, the bulk of the soybean crop is grown for oil and meal. The high-protein defatted and toasted soy meal becomes livestock feed and dog food. 98% of the US soybean crop goes for livestock feed. In 2011, 49% of the US maize/corn harvest was used for livestock feed (including the percentage of waste from distillers grains). &quot;Despite methods that are becoming more and more sensitive, tests have not yet been able to establish a difference in the meat, milk, or eggs of animals depending on the type of feed they are fed. It is impossible to tell if an animal was fed GM soy just by looking at the resulting meat, dairy, or egg products. The only way to verify the presence of GMOs in animal feed is to analyze the origin of the feed itself.&quot;

A 2012 literature review of studies evaluating the effect of GM feed on the health of animals did not find evidence that animals were adversely affected, although small biological differences were occasionally found. The studies included in the review ranged from 90 days to two years, with several of the longer studies considering reproductive and intergenerational effects.

Enzymes produced by genetically modified microorganisms are also integrated into animal feed to enhance availability of nutrients and overall digestion. These enzymes may also provide benefit to the gut microbiome of an animal, as well as hydrolyse antinutritional factors present in the feed.

===Proteins===
The foundation of genetic engineering is DNA, which directs the production of proteins. Proteins are also the common source of human allergens. When new proteins are introduced they must be assessed for potential allergenicity.

Rennet is a mixture of enzymes used to coagulate milk into cheese. Originally it was available only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin, the key enzyme. The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation. Chymosin is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers has an amino acid sequence that is identical to bovine rennet. The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey. Trace quantities of chymosin may remain in cheese.

FPC was the first artificially produced enzyme to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. FPC products have been on the market since 1990 and as of 2015 had yet to be surpassed in commercial markets. In 1999, about 60% of US hard cheese was made with FPC. Its global market share approached 80%. By 2008, approximately 80% to 90% of commercially made cheeses in the US and Britain were made using FPC.

In some countries, recombinant (GM) bovine somatotropin (also called rBST, or bovine growth hormone or BGH) is approved for administration to increase milk production. rBST may be present in milk from rBST treated cows, but it is destroyed in the digestive system and even if directly injected into the human bloodstream, has no observable effect on humans. The FDA, World Health Organization, American Medical Association, American Dietetic Association and the National Institutes of Health have independently stated that dairy products and meat from rBST-treated cows are safe for human consumption. On 30 September 2010, the United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, analyzing submitted evidence, found a &quot;compositional difference&quot; between milk from rBGH-treated cows and milk from untreated cows. The court stated that milk from rBGH-treated cows has: increased levels of the hormone Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1); higher fat content and lower protein content when produced at certain points in the cow&#x27;s lactation cycle; and more somatic cell counts, which may &quot;make the milk turn sour more quickly&quot;.

== Benefits ==
Genetically modified foods are usually edited to have some desired characteristics, including certain benefits for surviving extreme environments, an enhanced level to nutrition, the access of therapeutic substances, and the resistance genes to pesticide and herbicides. These characteristics could be beneficial to humans and the environment in certain ways.

=== Prepare for extreme weather ===
Plants that have undergone genetic modification are capable of surviving extreme weather. Genetically modified (GM) food crops can be cultivated in locations with unfavorable climatic conditions on occasion. The quality and yield of genetically modified foods are often improved. These foods tend to grow more quickly than conventionally cultivated ones. Furthermore, the application of genetically modified food could be beneficial in resisting drought and poor soil.

=== Nutritional enhancement ===
Increased levels of specific nutrients in food crops can be achieved by genetic engineering. The study of this technique, sometimes known as nutritional improvement, is already well advanced. Foods are well monitored to gain specific qualities that became practical, for example, concentrated nutraceutical levels and health-promoting chemicals, making them a desirable component of a varied diet. Among the notable breakthroughs of genetic modification is Golden Rice, whose genome is altered by the injection of the vitamin A gene from a daffodil plant conditioning provitamin A production. This increases the activity of phytoene synthase, which therefore synthesizes a higher amount of beta-carotene, followed by modification and improvement of the level of iron and bioavailability. This affects the rice’s color and vitamin content, which is beneficial in places where vitamin A shortage is common. In addition, increased mineral, vitamin A, and protein content has played a critical role in preventing childhood blindness and iron deficiency anemia.

Lipid composition could also be manipulated to produce desirable traits and essential nutrients. Scientific evidence has shown that inadequate consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is generally associated with the development of chronic diseases and developmental aberrations. Alimentary lipids can be modified to gain an increased saturated fatty acid together with a decreased polyunsaturated fatty acid component. Genes coded for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids are therefore introduced into plant cells, increasing the synthesis of polyunsaturated omega-3 acids. This omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid is responsible to lower the level of LDL cholesterol and triglyceride level as well as the incidence rate of cardiovascular diseases.

=== Production of therapeutic substances ===
The genetically modified organisms, including potato, tomato, and spinach are applied in the production of substances that stimulate the immune system to respond to specific pathogens. With the help of recombinant DNA techniques, the genes encoded for viral or bacterial antigens could be genetically transcribed and translated into plant cells. Antibodies are often produced in response to the introduction of antigens, in which the pathological microflora obtains the immune response towards specific antigens. The transgenic organisms are usually applied to use as oral vaccines, which allows the active substances to enter the human digestive system, targeting the alimentary tract in which stimulate a mucosal immune response. This technique has been widely used in vaccine production including rice, maize, and soybeans. Additionally, transgenic plants are widely used as bioreactors in the production of pharmaceutical proteins and peptides, including vaccines, hormones, human serum albumin (HSA), etc. The suitability of transgenic plants can helps meet the demand for the rapid growth of therapeutic antibodies. All this has given new impetus to the development of medicine.

== Health and safety ==
There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.

Opponents claim that long-term health risks have not been adequately assessed and propose various combinations of additional testing, labeling or removal from the market.

There are no certifications for foods that have been verified to be both genetically modified – in particular in a way that is ensured to be well-understood, safe and environmentally friendly – and otherwise organic (i.e. produced without the use of chemical pesticides) in the U.S. and possibly the world, giving consumers the binary choice of either genetically modified food or organic food.

=== Testing ===
The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. Countries such as the United States, Canada, Lebanon and Egypt use &quot;substantial equivalence&quot; to determine if further testing is required, while many countries such as those in the European Union, Brazil and China only authorize GMO cultivation on a case-by-case basis. In the U.S. the FDA determined that GMOs are &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; (GRAS) and therefore do not require additional testing if the GMO product is substantially equivalent to the non-modified product. If new substances are found, further testing may be required to satisfy concerns over potential toxicity, allergenicity, possible gene transfer to humans or genetic outcrossing to other organisms.

Some studies purporting to show harm have been discredited, in some cases leading to academic condemnation against the researchers such as the Pusztai affair and the Séralini affair.

==Regulation==
Government regulation of GMO development and release varies widely between countries. Marked differences separate GMO regulation in the U.S. and GMO regulation in the European Union. Regulation also varies depending on the intended product&#x27;s use. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety. European and EU regulation has been far more restrictive than anywhere else in the world: In 2013 only 1 cultivar of maize/corn and 1 cultivar of potato were approved, and eight EU member states did not allow even those.

===United States regulations===

In the U.S., three government organizations regulate GMOs. The FDA checks the chemical composition of organisms for potential allergens. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) supervises field testing and monitors the distribution of GM seeds. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for monitoring pesticide usage, including plants modified to contain proteins toxic to insects. Like USDA, EPA also oversees field testing and the distribution of crops that have had contact with pesticides to ensure environmental safety. In 2015 the Obama administration announced that it would update the way the government regulated GM crops.

In 1992 FDA published &quot;Statement of Policy: Foods derived from New Plant Varieties&quot;. This statement is a clarification of FDA&#x27;s interpretation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to foods produced from new plant varieties developed using recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) technology. FDA encouraged developers to consult with the FDA regarding any bioengineered foods in development. The FDA says developers routinely do reach out for consultations. In 1996 FDA updated consultation procedures.

The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified maize/corn that had not been approved for human consumption. It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.

=== European regulations ===
The European Union&#x27;s control of genetically modified organisms is a particular part of an image of the promise and limitations of debate as a framework for supranational regulation. The issues posed by the EU’s GMO regulation have caused major problems in agriculture, politics, societies, status, and other fields. 12 The EU law regulates the development and use of GMOs by allocating responsibilities to different authorities, public and private, accompanied by limited recognition of public information, consultation, and participation rights. The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) provided certain rights and protection for GM biotechnology in the EU. However, the value of human dignity, liberty, equality, and solidarity, as well as the status of democracy and law, as emphasized in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, are considered the ethical framework governing the employment of scientific and technological research and development.

Due to the political, religious, and social differences in EU countries, the EU’s position on GM has been divided geographically, including more than 100 “GM-free” regions. Different regional attitudes to GM foods make it nearly impossible to reach a common agreement on GM foods. In recent years, however, the sense of crisis that this has generated for the European Union has intensified. Some member states, including Germany, France, Austria, Italy, and Luxembourg, have even banned the planting of certain GM food in their countries in response to public resistance to GM foods. The whole thing is set against a backdrop of consumers holding the attitude that GM foods are harmful to both the environment and human health, revolting against GM foods in an anti-biotech coalition. The current political deadlock over GM foods is also a consequence of the ban and has yet to be resolved by scientific methods and processes. Public opinion tends to politicize the GM issue, which is the main obstacle to an agreement in the EU.
In the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency assesses GM foods for their toxicity, nutritional value, and potential to cause allergic reactions. GM foods can be authorised for sale where they present no risk to health, do not mislead consumers, and have nutritional value at least equivalent to non-modified counterparts. The Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Act passed into law on 23 March 2023. The UK government said it would allow farmers to &quot;grow crops which are drought and disease resistant, reduce use of fertilisers and pesticides, and help breed animals that are protected from catching harmful diseases&quot;.

===Labeling===
As of 2015, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.

US and Canadian national policy is to require a label only given significant composition differences or documented health impacts, although some individual US states (Vermont, Connecticut and Maine) enacted laws requiring them. In July 2016, Public Law 114-214 was enacted to regulate labeling of GMO food on a national basis.

In some jurisdictions, the labeling requirement depends on the relative quantity of GMO in the product. A study that investigated voluntary labeling in South Africa found that 31% of products labeled as GMO-free had a GM content above 1.0%.

In the European Union all food (including processed food) or feed that contains greater than 0.9% GMOs must be labelled.

At the same time, due to lack of single, clear definition of GMO, a number of foods created using genetic engineering techniques (such as mutation breeding) are excluded from labelling and regulation based on &quot;convention&quot; and traditional usage.

The Non-GMO Project is the sole U.S. organization that does verifiable testing and places seals on labels for presence of GMO in products. The &quot;Non-GMO Project Seal&quot; indicates that the product contains 0.9% or less GMO ingredients, which is the European Union&#x27;s standard for labeling.

Efforts across the world that are being made to help restrict and label GMO&#x27;s in food involve anti-genetic engineering campaigns and in America the &quot;Just Label It&quot; movement is joining organizations together to call for mandatory labeling.

===Detection===

Testing on GMOs in food and feed is routinely done using molecular techniques such as PCR and bioinformatics.

In a January 2010 paper, the extraction and detection of DNA along a complete industrial soybean oil processing chain was described to monitor the presence of Roundup Ready (RR) soybean: &quot;The amplification of soybean lectin gene by end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was successfully achieved in all the steps of extraction and refining processes, until the fully refined soybean oil. The amplification of RR soybean by PCR assays using event-specific primers was also achieved for all the extraction and refining steps, except for the intermediate steps of refining (neutralisation, washing and bleaching) possibly due to sample instability. The real-time PCR assays using specific probes confirmed all the results and proved that it is possible to detect and quantify genetically modified organisms in the fully refined soybean oil. To our knowledge, this has never been reported before and represents an important accomplishment regarding the traceability of genetically modified organisms in refined oils.&quot;

According to Thomas Redick, detection and prevention of cross-pollination is possible through the suggestions offered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Suggestions include educating farmers on the importance of coexistence, providing farmers with tools and incentives to promote coexistence, conducting research to understand and monitor gene flow, providing assurance of quality and diversity in crops, and providing compensation for actual economic losses for farmers.

=== Regulation methodology design ===


==Controversies==
The genetically modified foods controversy consists of a set of disputes over the use of food made from genetically modified crops. The disputes involve consumers, farmers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations, environmental and political activists and scientists. The major disagreements include whether GM foods can be safely consumed, harm the human body and the environment and/or are adequately tested and regulated. The objectivity of scientific research and publications has been challenged. Farming-related disputes include the use and impact of pesticides, seed production and use, side effects on non-GMO crops/farms, and potential control of the GM food supply by seed companies.

The conflicts have continued since GM foods were invented. They have occupied the media, the courts, local, regional, national governments, and international organizations.

&quot;GMO-free&quot; labelling schemes are causing controversies in farming community due to lack of clear definition, inconsistency of their application and are described as &quot;deceptive&quot;.

=== Allergenicity ===
New allergies could be introduced inadvertently, according to scientists, community groups, and members of the public concerned about the genetic variation of foods. An example involves the methionine rich soybean production. Methionine is an amino acid obtained by synthesizing substances derived from Brazil nuts, which could be an allergen. A gene from the Brazil nut was inserted into soybeans during laboratory trials. Because it was discovered that those who were allergic to Brazil nuts could also be allergic to genetically modified soybeans, the experiment was stopped. In vitro assays such as RAST or serum from people allergic to the original crop could be applied to test the allergenicity of GM goods with known source of the gene. This was established in GM soybeans that expressed Brazil nut 2S proteins and GM potatoes that expressed cod protein genes. The expression and synthesis of new proteins that were previously unavailable in parental cells were achieved by gene transfer from the cells of one organism to the nuclei of another organism. The potential risks of allergy that may develop with the intake of transgenic food come from the amino acid sequence in protein formation. However, there have been no reports of allergic reactions to currently approved GM foods for human consumption, and experiments showed no measurable difference in allergenicity between GM and non-GM soybeans.

=== Resistance genes ===
Scientists suggest that consumers should also pay attention to the health issues associated with the utilizations of pesticide-resistant and herbicide-resistant plants. The ‘Bt’ genes cause insect resistance in today&#x27;s GM crops; however, other methods to confer insect resistance are in the works. The Bt genes are usually obtained from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, and they can generate a protein that breaks down in the insect’s gut, releasing a toxin called delta-endotoxin, which causes paralysis and death. Concerns about resistance and off-target effects of crops expressing Bt toxins, consequences of transgenic herbicide-tolerant plants caused by the use of herbicide, and the transfer of gene expression from GM crops via vertical and horizontal gene transfer are all related to the expression of transgenic material.

=== Environmental impacts ===
Another concern raised by ecologists is the possible spread of the pest-resistant genes to wildlife. This is an example of gene pollution, which is often associated with a decrease in biodiversity, proliferation resistant weeds, and the formation of new pests and pathogens.

Studies have proven that herbicide resistant pollen from transgenic rapeseed could spread up to 3 km, while the average gene spread of transgenic crops is 2 km and even reach to maximum 21 kilometers. The high aggressiveness of these GM crops could cause certain disasters by competing with traditional crops for water, light, and nutrients. Crossbreeding of spreading pollens with the surrounding organisms has led to the introduction of the modified resistant genes. An international database that demonstrated genetic contaminations with undesired seeds has been a major problem due to the expansion of field trials and commercially viable cultivation of GM crops around the world. Even a decrease in the number of one pest under the impact of a pest-resistant weed could increase the population of other pests that compete with it. Beneficial insects, so named because they prey on crop pests, were also exposed to dangerous doses of Bt.

=== Other concerns ===
The introduction of GM crops in place of more locally adapted varieties could lead to long-term negative effects on the entire agricultural system. Much of the concern with GM technology involves encoding genes that increase or decrease biochemicals. Alternatively, the newly programmed enzyme might result in the consumption of the substrate, forming and accumulating the products.

In terms of socioeconomics, GM crops are usually dependent on high levels of external products, for example, pesticides and herbicides, which limit GM crops to high-input agriculture. This, coupled with the widespread patents held on GM crops, limited farmers’ trading rights over the harvested seeds without paying royalties. Other arguments against GM crops held by some opponents are based on the high costs of isolating and distributing GM crops over non-GM crops.

Consumers could be categorized based on their attitudes regarding genetically modified foods. The ‘attitudinal’ sector of US consumers could be explained in part by cognitive characteristics that are not always observable. Individual characteristics and values, for example, can play a role in shaping consumer acceptance of biotechnology. The concept of transplanting animal DNA into plants is unsettling for many people. Studies have shown that consumers&#x27; attitudes towards GM technology are positively correlated to their knowledge about it. It was found that elevated acceptance of genetic modification is usually associated with a high education level, whereas high levels of perceived risks are associated with the opposite. People tend to worry about unpredictable dangers due to the lack of sufficient knowledge to predict or avoid negative impacts.

Another crucial link of the change in consumer attitudes towards genetically modified foods has been shown to be closely related to their interaction with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, for example, age, ethnicity, residence, and level of consumption. Opposition to genetically modified foods could also include religious and cultural groups, because the nature of GM foods goes against what they believe are natural products. On the one hand, it was found that consumers in most European countries, especially in northern Europe, the UK and Germany, believe that the benefits of GM foods do not outweigh the potential risks. On the other hand, consumers in the United States and other European countries generally hold to view that the risks of GM foods could be far less than the benefits it brought. GM foods are then expected to be supported by more appropriate policies and clearer regulations.

<text>Protein engineering is the process of developing useful or valuable proteins through the design and production of unnatural polypeptides, often by altering amino acid sequences found in nature. It is a young discipline, with much research taking place into the understanding of protein folding and recognition for protein design principles. It has been used to improve the function of many enzymes for industrial catalysis. It is also a product and services market, with an estimated value of $168 billion by 2017.

There are two general strategies for protein engineering: rational protein design and directed evolution. These methods are not mutually exclusive; researchers will often apply both. In the future, more detailed knowledge of protein structure and function, and advances in high-throughput screening, may greatly expand the abilities of protein engineering. Eventually, even unnatural amino acids may be included, via newer methods, such as expanded genetic code, that allow encoding novel amino acids in genetic code.
The applications in numerous fields, including medicine and industrial bioprocessing, are vast and numerous.

==Approaches==

=== Rational design ===

In rational protein design, a scientist uses detailed knowledge of the structure and function of a protein to make desired changes. In general, this has the advantage of being inexpensive and technically easy, since site-directed mutagenesis methods are well-developed. However, its major drawback is that detailed structural knowledge of a protein is often unavailable, and, even when available, it can be very difficult to predict the effects of various mutations since structural information most often provide a static picture of a protein structure. However, programs such as Folding@home and Foldit have utilized crowdsourcing techniques in order to gain insight into the folding motifs of proteins.
Computational protein design algorithms seek to identify novel amino acid sequences that are low in energy when folded to the pre-specified target structure. While the sequence-conformation space that needs to be searched is large, the most challenging requirement for computational protein design is a fast, yet accurate, energy function that can distinguish optimal sequences from similar suboptimal ones.

===Multiple sequence alignment===
Without structural information about a protein, sequence analysis is often useful in elucidating information about the protein. These techniques involve alignment of target protein sequences with other related protein sequences. This alignment can show which amino acids are conserved between species and are important for the function of the protein. These analyses can help to identify hot spot amino acids that can serve as the target sites for mutations. Multiple sequence alignment utilizes data bases such as PREFAB, SABMARK, OXBENCH, IRMBASE, and BALIBASE in order to cross reference target protein sequences with known sequences. Multiple sequence alignment techniques are listed below.

This method begins by performing pair wise alignment of sequences using k-tuple or Needleman–Wunsch methods. These methods calculate a matrix that depicts the pair wise similarity among the sequence pairs. Similarity scores are then transformed into distance scores that are used to produce a guide tree using the neighbor joining method. This guide tree is then employed to yield a multiple sequence alignment.

====Clustal omega====
This method is capable of aligning up to 190,000 sequences by utilizing the k-tuple method. Next sequences are clustered using the mBed and &quot;k&quot;-means methods. A guide tree is then constructed using the UPGMA method that is used by the HH align package. This guide tree is used to generate multiple sequence alignments.

====MAFFT====
This method utilizes fast Fourier transform (FFT) that converts amino acid sequences into a sequence composed of volume and polarity values for each amino acid residue. This new sequence is used to find homologous regions.

====K-Align====
This method utilizes the Wu-Manber approximate string matching algorithm to generate multiple sequence alignments.

====Multiple sequence comparison by log expectation (MUSCLE)====
This method utilizes Kmer and Kimura distances to generate multiple sequence alignments.

====T-Coffee====
This method utilizes tree based consistency objective functions for alignment evolution. This method has been shown to be 5–10% more accurate than Clustal W.

===Coevolutionary analysis===
Coevolutionary analysis is also known as correlated mutation, covariation, or co-substitution. This type of rational design involves reciprocal evolutionary changes at evolutionarily interacting loci. Generally this method begins with the generation of a curated multiple sequence alignments for the target sequence. This alignment is then subjected to manual refinement that involves removal of highly gapped sequences, as well as sequences with low sequence identity. This step increases the quality of the alignment. Next, the manually processed alignment is utilized for further coevolutionary measurements using distinct correlated mutation algorithms. These algorithms result in a coevolution scoring matrix. This matrix is filtered by applying various significance tests to extract significant coevolution values and wipe out background noise. Coevolutionary measurements are further evaluated to assess their performance and stringency. Finally, the results from this coevolutionary analysis are validated experimentally.

===Structural prediction===
&quot;De novo&quot; generation of protein benefits from knowledge of existing protein structures. This knowledge of existing protein structure assists with the prediction of new protein structures. Methods for protein structure prediction fall under one of the four following classes: &quot;ab initio,&quot; fragment based methods, homology modeling, and protein threading.

====&quot;Ab initio&quot;====
These methods involve free modeling without using any structural information about the template. &quot;Ab initio&quot; methods are aimed at prediction of the native structures of proteins corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy. some examples of &quot;ab initio&quot; methods are AMBER, GROMOS, GROMACS, CHARMM, OPLS, and ENCEPP12. General steps for &quot;ab initio&quot; methods begin with the geometric representation of the protein of interest. Next, a potential energy function model for the protein is developed. This model can be created using either molecular mechanics potentials or protein structure derived potential functions. Following the development of a potential model, energy search techniques including molecular dynamic simulations, Monte Carlo simulations and genetic algorithms are applied to the protein.

====Fragment based====
These methods use database information regarding structures to match homologous structures to the created protein sequences. These homologous structures are assembled to give compact structures using scoring and optimization procedures, with the goal of achieving the lowest potential energy score. Webservers for fragment information are I-TASSER, ROSETTA, ROSETTA @ home, FRAGFOLD, CABS fold, PROFESY, CREF, QUARK, UNDERTAKER, HMM, and ANGLOR.

====Homology modeling====
These methods are based upon the homology of proteins. These methods are also known as comparative modeling. The first step in homology modeling is generally the identification of template sequences of known structure which are homologous to the query sequence. Next the query sequence is aligned to the template sequence. Following the alignment, the structurally conserved regions are modeled using the template structure. This is followed by the modeling of side chains and loops that are distinct from the template. Finally the modeled structure undergoes refinement and assessment of quality. Servers that are available for homology modeling data are listed here: SWISS MODEL, MODELLER, ReformAlign, PyMOD, TIP-STRUCTFAST, COMPASS, 3d-PSSM, SAMT02, SAMT99, HHPRED, FAGUE, 3D-JIGSAW, META-PP, ROSETTA, and I-TASSER.

====Protein threading====
Protein threading can be used when a reliable homologue for the query sequence cannot be found. This method begins by obtaining a query sequence and a library of template structures. Next, the query sequence is threaded over known template structures. These candidate models are scored using scoring functions. These are scored based upon potential energy models of both query and template sequence. The match with the lowest potential energy model is then selected. Methods and servers for retrieving threading data and performing calculations are listed here: GenTHREADER, pGenTHREADER, pDomTHREADER, ORFEUS, PROSPECT, BioShell-Threading, FFASO3, RaptorX, HHPred, LOOPP server, Sparks-X, SEGMER, THREADER2, ESYPRED3D, LIBRA, TOPITS, RAPTOR, COTH, MUSTER.

For more information on rational design see site-directed mutagenesis.

=== Multivalent binding ===

Multivalent binding can be used to increase the binding specificity and affinity through avidity effects. Having multiple binding domains in a single biomolecule or complex increases the likelihood of other interactions to occur via individual binding events. Avidity or effective affinity can be much higher than the sum of the individual affinities providing a cost and time-effective tool for targeted binding.

==== Multivalent proteins ====
Multivalent proteins are relatively easy to produce by post-translational modifications or multiplying the protein-coding DNA sequence. The main advantage of multivalent and multispecific proteins is that they can increase the effective affinity for a target of a known protein. In the case of an inhomogeneous target using a combination of proteins resulting in multispecific binding can increase specificity, which has high applicability in protein therapeutics.

The most common example for multivalent binding are the antibodies, and there is extensive research for bispecific antibodies. Applications of bispecific antibodies cover a broad spectrum that includes diagnosis, imaging, prophylaxis, and therapy.

=== Directed evolution ===

In directed evolution, random mutagenesis, e.g. by error-prone PCR or sequence saturation mutagenesis, is applied to a protein, and a selection regime is used to select variants having desired traits. Further rounds of mutation and selection are then applied. This method mimics natural evolution and, in general, produces superior results to rational design. An added process, termed DNA shuffling, mixes and matches pieces of successful variants to produce better results. Such processes mimic the recombination that occurs naturally during sexual reproduction. Advantages of directed evolution are that it requires no prior structural knowledge of a protein, nor is it necessary to be able to predict what effect a given mutation will have. Indeed, the results of directed evolution experiments are often surprising in that desired changes are often caused by mutations that were not expected to have some effect. The drawback is that they require high-throughput screening, which is not feasible for all proteins. Large amounts of recombinant DNA must be mutated and the products screened for desired traits. The large number of variants often requires expensive robotic equipment to automate the process. Further, not all desired activities can be screened for easily.

Natural Darwinian evolution can be effectively imitated in the lab toward tailoring protein properties for diverse applications, including catalysis. Many experimental technologies exist to produce large and diverse protein libraries and for screening or selecting folded, functional variants. Folded proteins arise surprisingly frequently in random sequence space, an occurrence exploitable in evolving selective binders and catalysts. While more conservative than direct selection from deep sequence space, redesign of existing proteins by random mutagenesis and selection/screening is a particularly robust method for optimizing or altering extant properties. It also represents an excellent starting point for achieving more ambitious engineering goals. Allying experimental evolution with modern computational methods is likely the broadest, most fruitful strategy for generating functional macromolecules unknown to nature.

The main challenges of designing high quality mutant libraries have shown significant progress in the recent past. This progress has been in the form of better descriptions of the effects of mutational loads on protein traits. Also computational approaches have showed large advances in the innumerably large sequence space to more manageable screenable sizes, thus creating smart libraries of mutants. Library size has also been reduced to more screenable sizes by the identification of key beneficial residues using algorithms for systematic recombination. Finally a significant step forward toward efficient reengineering of enzymes has been made with the development of more accurate statistical models and algorithms quantifying and predicting coupled mutational effects on protein functions.

Generally, directed evolution may be summarized as an iterative two step process which involves generation of protein mutant libraries, and high throughput screening processes to select for variants with improved traits. This technique does not require prior knowledge of the protein structure and function relationship. Directed evolution utilizes random or focused mutagenesis to generate libraries of mutant proteins. Random mutations can be introduced using either error prone PCR, or site saturation mutagenesis. Mutants may also be generated using recombination of multiple homologous genes. Nature has evolved a limited number of beneficial sequences. Directed evolution makes it possible to identify undiscovered protein sequences which have novel functions. This ability is contingent on the proteins ability to tolerant amino acid residue substitutions without compromising folding or stability.

Directed evolution methods can be broadly categorized into two strategies, asexual and sexual methods.

=== Asexual methods ===
Asexual methods do not generate any cross links between parental genes. Single genes are used to create mutant libraries using various mutagenic techniques. These asexual methods can produce either random or focused mutagenesis.

==== Random mutagenesis ====
Random mutagenic methods produce mutations at random throughout the gene of interest. Random mutagenesis can introduce the following types of mutations: transitions, transversions, insertions, deletions, inversion, missense, and nonsense. Examples of methods for producing random mutagenesis are below.

====Error prone PCR====
Error prone PCR utilizes the fact that Taq DNA polymerase lacks 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; exonuclease activity. This results in an error rate of 0.001–0.002% per nucleotide per replication. This method begins with choosing the gene, or the area within a gene, one wishes to mutate. Next, the extent of error required is calculated based upon the type and extent of activity one wishes to generate. This extent of error determines the error prone PCR strategy to be employed. Following PCR, the genes are cloned into a plasmid and introduced to competent cell systems. These cells are then screened for desired traits. Plasmids are then isolated for colonies which show improved traits, and are then used as templates the next round of mutagenesis. Error prone PCR shows biases for certain mutations relative to others. Such as biases for transitions over transversions.

Rates of error in PCR can be increased in the following ways:
# Increase concentration of magnesium chloride, which stabilizes non complementary base pairing.
# Add manganese chloride to reduce base pair specificity. 
# Increased and unbalanced addition of dNTPs.
# Addition of base analogs like dITP, 8 oxo-dGTP, and dPTP.
# Increase concentration of Taq polymerase.
# Increase extension time.
# Increase cycle time.
# Use less accurate Taq polymerase.
Also see polymerase chain reaction for more information.

====Rolling circle error-prone PCR====
This PCR method is based upon rolling circle amplification, which is modeled from the method that bacteria use to amplify circular DNA. This method results in linear DNA duplexes. These fragments contain tandem repeats of circular DNA called concatamers, which can be transformed into bacterial strains. Mutations are introduced by first cloning the target sequence into an appropriate plasmid. Next, the amplification process begins using random hexamer primers and Φ29 DNA polymerase under error prone rolling circle amplification conditions. Additional conditions to produce error prone rolling circle amplification are 1.5 pM of template DNA, 1.5 mM MnCl2 and a 24 hour reaction time. MnCl2 is added into the reaction mixture to promote random point mutations in the DNA strands. Mutation rates can be increased by increasing the concentration of MnCl2, or by decreasing concentration of the template DNA. Error prone rolling circle amplification is advantageous relative to error prone PCR because of its use of universal random hexamer primers, rather than specific primers. Also the reaction products of this amplification do not need to be treated with ligases or endonucleases. This reaction is isothermal.

====Chemical mutagenesis====
Chemical mutagenesis involves the use of chemical agents to introduce mutations into genetic sequences. Examples of chemical mutagens follow.

Sodium bisulfate is effective at mutating G/C rich genomic sequences. This is because sodium bisulfate catalyses deamination of unmethylated cytosine to uracil.

Ethyl methane sulfonate alkylates guanidine residues. This alteration causes errors during DNA replication.

Nitrous acid causes transversion by de-amination of adenine and cytosine.

The dual approach to random chemical mutagenesis is an iterative two step process. First it involves the &quot;in vivo&quot; chemical mutagenesis of the gene of interest via EMS. Next, the treated gene is isolated and cloning into an untreated expression vector in order to prevent mutations in the plasmid backbone. This technique preserves the plasmids genetic properties.

====Targeting glycosylases to embedded arrays for mutagenesis (TaGTEAM)====
This method has been used to create targeted &quot;in vivo&quot; mutagenesis in yeast. This method involves the fusion of a 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase to tetR DNA-binding domain. This has been shown to increase mutation rates by over 800 time in regions of the genome containing tetO sites.

====Mutagenesis by random insertion and deletion====
This method involves alteration in length of the sequence via simultaneous deletion and insertion of chunks of bases of arbitrary length. This method has been shown to produce proteins with new functionalities via introduction of new restriction sites, specific codons, four base codons for non-natural amino acids.

====Transposon based random mutagenesis====
Recently many methods for transposon based random mutagenesis have been reported. This methods include, but are not limited to the following: PERMUTE-random circular permutation, random protein truncation, random nucleotide triplet substitution, random domain/tag/multiple amino acid insertion, codon scanning mutagenesis, and multicodon scanning mutagenesis. These aforementioned techniques all require the design of mini-Mu transposons. Thermo scientific manufactures kits for the design of these transposons.

====Random mutagenesis methods altering the target DNA length====
These methods involve altering gene length via insertion and deletion mutations. An example is the tandem repeat insertion (TRINS) method. This technique results in the generation of tandem repeats of random fragments of the target gene via rolling circle amplification and concurrent incorporation of these repeats into the target gene.

====Mutator strains====
Mutator strains are bacterial cell lines which are deficient in one or more DNA repair mechanisms. An example of a mutator strand is the E. coli XL1-RED. This subordinate strain of E. coli is deficient in the MutS, MutD, MutT DNA repair pathways. Use of mutator strains is useful at introducing many types of mutation; however, these strains show progressive sickness of culture because of the accumulation of mutations in the strains own genome.

==== Focused mutagenesis ====
Focused mutagenic methods produce mutations at predetermined amino acid residues. These techniques require and understanding of the sequence-function relationship for the protein of interest. Understanding of this relationship allows for the identification of residues which are important in stability, stereoselectivity, and catalytic efficiency. Examples of methods that produce focused mutagenesis are below.

====Site saturation mutagenesis====
Site saturation mutagenesis is a PCR based method used to target amino acids with significant roles in protein function. The two most common techniques for performing this are whole plasmid single PCR, and overlap extension PCR.

Whole plasmid single PCR is also referred to as site directed mutagenesis (SDM). SDM products are subjected to Dpn endonuclease digestion. This digestion results in cleavage of only the parental strand, because the parental strand contains a GmATC which is methylated at N6 of adenine. SDM does not work well for large plasmids of over ten kilobases. Also, this method is only capable of replacing two nucleotides at a time.

Overlap extension PCR requires the use of two pairs of primers. One primer in each set contains a mutation. A first round of PCR using these primer sets is performed and two double stranded DNA duplexes are formed. A second round of PCR is then performed in which these duplexes are denatured and annealed with the primer sets again to produce heteroduplexes, in which each strand has a mutation. Any gaps in these newly formed heteroduplexes are filled with DNA polymerases and further amplified.

====Sequence saturation mutagenesis (SeSaM)====
Sequence saturation mutagenesis results in the randomization of the target sequence at every nucleotide position. This method begins with the generation of variable length DNA fragments tailed with universal bases via the use of template transferases at the 3&#x27; termini. Next, these fragments are extended to full length using a single stranded template. The universal bases are replaced with a random standard base, causing mutations. There are several modified versions of this method such as SeSAM-Tv-II, SeSAM-Tv+, and SeSAM-III.

====Single primer reactions in parallel (SPRINP)====
This site saturation mutagenesis method involves two separate PCR reaction. The first of which uses only forward primers, while the second reaction uses only reverse primers. This avoids the formation of primer dimer formation.

====Mega primed and ligase free focused mutagenesis====
This site saturation mutagenic technique begins with one mutagenic oligonucleotide and one universal flanking primer. These two reactants are used for an initial PCR cycle. Products from this first PCR cycle are used as mega primers for the next PCR.

====Ω-PCR====
This site saturation mutagenic method is based on overlap extension PCR. It is used to introduce mutations at any site in a circular plasmid.

====PFunkel-ominchange-OSCARR====
This method utilizes user defined site directed mutagenesis at single or multiple sites simultaneously. OSCARR is an acronym for &quot;one pot simple methodology for cassette randomization and recombination&quot;. This randomization and recombination results in randomization of desired fragments of a protein. Omnichange is a sequence independent, multisite saturation mutagenesis which can saturate up to five independent codons on a gene.

====Trimer-dimer mutagenesis====
This method removes redundant codons and stop codons.

====Cassette mutagenesis====
This is a PCR based method. Cassette mutagenesis begins with the synthesis of a DNA cassette containing the gene of interest, which is flanked on either side by restriction sites. The endonuclease which cleaves these restriction sites also cleaves sites in the target plasmid. The DNA cassette and the target plasmid are both treated with endonucleases to cleave these restriction sites and create sticky ends. Next the products from this cleavage are ligated together, resulting in the insertion of the gene into the target plasmid. An alternative form of cassette mutagenesis called combinatorial cassette mutagenesis is used to identify the functions of individual amino acid residues in the protein of interest. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis then utilizes information from previous combinatorial cassette mutagenesis. Codon cassette mutagenesis allows you to insert or replace a single codon at a particular site in double stranded DNA.

=== Sexual methods ===
Sexual methods of directed evolution involve &quot;in vitro&quot; recombination which mimic natural &quot;in vivo&quot; recombination. Generally these techniques require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques are often used to recombine two different parental genes, and these methods do create cross overs between these genes.

==== &quot;In vitro&quot; homologous recombination ====
Homologous recombination can be categorized as either &quot;in vivo&quot; or &quot;in vitro. In vitro&quot; homologous recombination mimics natural &quot;in vivo&quot; recombination. These &quot;in vitro&quot; recombination methods require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques exploit the natural diversity in parental genes by recombining them to yield chimeric genes. The resulting chimera show a blend of parental characteristics.

====DNA shuffling====
This &quot;in vitro&quot; technique was one of the first techniques in the era of recombination. It begins with the digestion of homologous parental genes into small fragments by DNase1. These small fragments are then purified from undigested parental genes. Purified fragments are then reassembled using primer-less PCR. This PCR involves homologous fragments from different parental genes priming for each other, resulting in chimeric DNA. The chimeric DNA of parental size is then amplified using end terminal primers in regular PCR.

====Random priming &quot;in vitro&quot; recombination (RPR)====
This &quot;in vitro&quot; homologous recombination method begins with the synthesis of many short gene fragments exhibiting point mutations using random sequence primers. These fragments are reassembled to full length parental genes using primer-less PCR. These reassembled sequences are then amplified using PCR and subjected to further selection processes. This method is advantageous relative to DNA shuffling because there is no use of DNase1, thus there is no bias for recombination next to a pyrimidine nucleotide. This method is also advantageous due to its use of synthetic random primers which are uniform in length, and lack biases. Finally this method is independent of the length of DNA template sequence, and requires a small amount of parental DNA.

====Truncated metagenomic gene-specific PCR====
This method generates chimeric genes directly from metagenomic samples. It begins with isolation of the desired gene by functional screening from metagenomic DNA sample. Next, specific primers are designed and used to amplify the homologous genes from different environmental samples. Finally, chimeric libraries are generated to retrieve the desired functional clones by shuffling these amplified homologous genes.

====Staggered extension process (StEP)====
This &quot;in vitro&quot; method is based on template switching to generate chimeric genes. This PCR based method begins with an initial denaturation of the template, followed by annealing of primers and a short extension time. All subsequent cycle generate annealing between the short fragments generated in previous cycles and different parts of the template. These short fragments and the templates anneal together based on sequence complementarity. This process of fragments annealing template DNA is known as template switching. These annealed fragments will then serve as primers for further extension. This method is carried out until the parental length chimeric gene sequence is obtained. Execution of this method only requires flanking primers to begin. There is also no need for Dnase1 enzyme.

====Random chimeragenesis on transient templates (RACHITT)====
This method has been shown to generate chimeric gene libraries with an average of 14 crossovers per chimeric gene. It begins by aligning fragments from a parental top strand onto the bottom strand of a uracil containing template from a homologous gene. 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; overhang flaps are cleaved and gaps are filled by the exonuclease and endonuclease activities of Pfu and taq DNA polymerases. The uracil containing template is then removed from the heteroduplex by treatment with a uracil DNA glcosylase, followed by further amplification using PCR. This method is advantageous because it generates chimeras with relatively high crossover frequency. However it is somewhat limited due to the complexity and the need for generation of single stranded DNA and uracil containing single stranded template DNA.

====Synthetic shuffling====
Shuffling of synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides adds flexibility to shuffling methods, since oligonucleotides containing optimal codons and beneficial mutations can be included.

==== &quot;In vivo&quot; Homologous Recombination ====
Cloning performed in yeast involves PCR dependent reassembly of fragmented expression vectors. These reassembled vectors are then introduced to, and cloned in yeast. Using yeast to clone the vector avoids toxicity and counter-selection that would be introduced by ligation and propagation in E. coli.

====Mutagenic organized recombination process by homologous &quot;in vivo&quot; grouping (MORPHING)====
This method introduces mutations into specific regions of genes while leaving other parts intact by utilizing the high frequency of homologous recombination in yeast.

====Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE)====

This method utilizes a bacteriophage with a modified life cycle to transfer evolving genes from host to host. The phage&#x27;s life cycle is designed in such a way that the transfer is correlated with the activity of interest from the enzyme. This method is advantageous because it requires minimal human intervention for the continuous evolution of the gene.

=== &quot;In vitro&quot; non-homologous recombination methods ===
These methods are based upon the fact that proteins can exhibit similar structural identity while lacking sequence homology.

===Exon shuffling===
Exon shuffling is the combination of exons from different proteins by recombination events occurring at introns. Orthologous exon shuffling involves combining exons from orthologous genes from different species. Orthologous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from orthologous genes from different species. Paralogous exon shuffling involves shuffling of exon from different genes from the same species. Paralogous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from paralogous proteins from the same species. Functional homolog shuffling involves shuffling of non-homologous domains which are functional related. All of these processes being with amplification of the desired exons from different genes using chimeric synthetic oligonucleotides. This amplification products are then reassembled into full length genes using primer-less PCR. During these PCR cycles the fragments act as templates and primers. This results in chimeric full length genes, which are then subjected to screening.

====Incremental truncation for the creation of hybrid enzymes (ITCHY)====
Fragments of parental genes are created using controlled digestion by exonuclease III. These fragments are blunted using endonuclease, and are ligated to produce hybrid genes. THIOITCHY is a modified ITCHY technique which utilized nucleotide triphosphate analogs such as α-phosphothioate dNTPs. Incorporation of these nucleotides blocks digestion by exonuclease III. This inhibition of digestion by exonuclease III is called spiking. Spiking can be accomplished by first truncating genes with exonuclease to create fragments with short single stranded overhangs. These fragments then serve as templates for amplification by DNA polymerase in the presence of small amounts of phosphothioate dNTPs. These resulting fragments are then ligated together to form full length genes. Alternatively the intact parental genes can be amplified by PCR in the presence of normal dNTPs and phosphothioate dNTPs. These full length amplification products are then subjected to digestion by an exonuclease. Digestion will continue until the exonuclease encounters an α-pdNTP, resulting in fragments of different length. These fragments are then ligated together to generate chimeric genes.

====SCRATCHY====
This method generates libraries of hybrid genes inhibiting multiple crossovers by combining DNA shuffling and ITCHY. This method begins with the construction of two independent ITCHY libraries. The first with gene A on the N-terminus. And the other having gene B on the N-terminus. These hybrid gene fragments are separated using either restriction enzyme digestion or PCR with terminus primers via agarose gel electrophoresis. These isolated fragments are then mixed together and further digested using DNase1. Digested fragments are then reassembled by primerless PCR with template switching.

====Recombined extension on truncated templates (RETT)====
This method generates libraries of hybrid genes by template switching of uni-directionally growing polynucleotides in the presence of single stranded DNA fragments as templates for chimeras. This method begins with the preparation of single stranded DNA fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the single stranded DNA. These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other single stranded DNA fragments. This process is repeated until full length single stranded DNA is obtained.

====Sequence homology-independent protein recombination (SHIPREC)====
This method generates recombination between genes with little to no sequence homology. These chimeras are fused via a linker sequence containing several restriction sites. This construct is then digested using DNase1. Fragments are made are made blunt ended using S1 nuclease. These blunt end fragments are put together into a circular sequence by ligation. This circular construct is then linearized using restriction enzymes for which the restriction sites are present in the linker region. This results in a library of chimeric genes in which contribution of genes to 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; end will be reversed as compared to the starting construct.

====Sequence independent site directed chimeragenesis (SISDC)====
This method results in a library of genes with multiple crossovers from several parental genes. This method does not require sequence identity among the parental genes. This does require one or two conserved amino acids at every crossover position. It begins with alignment of parental sequences and identification of consensus regions which serve as crossover sites. This is followed by the incorporation of specific tags containing restriction sites followed by the removal of the tags by digestion with Bac1, resulting in genes with cohesive ends. These gene fragments are mixed and ligated in an appropriate order to form chimeric libraries.

====Degenerate homo-duplex recombination (DHR)====
This method begins with alignment of homologous genes, followed by identification of regions of polymorphism. Next the top strand of the gene is divided into small degenerate oligonucleotides. The bottom strand is also digested into oligonucleotides to serve as scaffolds. These fragments are combined in solution are top strand oligonucleotides are assembled onto bottom strand oligonucleotides. Gaps between these fragments are filled with polymerase and ligated.

====Random multi-recombinant PCR (RM-PCR)====
This method involves the shuffling of plural DNA fragments without homology, in a single PCR. This results in the reconstruction of complete proteins by assembly of modules encoding different structural units.

====User friendly DNA recombination (USERec)====
This method begins with the amplification of gene fragments which need to be recombined, using uracil dNTPs. This amplification solution also contains primers, PfuTurbo, and Cx Hotstart DNA polymerase. Amplified products are next incubated with USER enzyme. This enzyme catalyzes the removal of uracil residues from DNA creating single base pair gaps. The USER enzyme treated fragments are mixed and ligated using T4 DNA ligase and subjected to Dpn1 digestion to remove the template DNA. These resulting dingle stranded fragments are subjected to amplification using PCR, and are transformed into E. coli.

====Golden Gate shuffling (GGS) recombination====
This method allows you to recombine at least 9 different fragments in an acceptor vector by using type 2 restriction enzyme which cuts outside of the restriction sites. It begins with sub cloning of fragments in separate vectors to create Bsa1 flanking sequences on both sides. These vectors are then cleaved using type II restriction enzyme Bsa1, which generates four nucleotide single strand overhangs. Fragments with complementary overhangs are hybridized and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. Finally these constructs are then transformed into E. coli cells, which are screened for expression levels.

====Phosphoro thioate-based DNA recombination method (PRTec)====
This method can be used to recombine structural elements or entire protein domains. This method is based on phosphorothioate chemistry which allows the specific cleavage of phosphorothiodiester bonds. The first step in the process begins with amplification of fragments that need to be recombined along with the vector backbone. This amplification is accomplished using primers with phosphorothiolated nucleotides at 5&#x27; ends. Amplified PCR products are cleaved in an ethanol-iodine solution at high temperatures. Next these fragments are hybridized at room temperature and transformed into E. coli which repair any nicks.

====Integron====
This system is based upon a natural site specific recombination system in E. coli. This system is called the integron system, and produces natural gene shuffling. This method was used to construct and optimize a functional tryptophan biosynthetic operon in trp-deficient E. coli by delivering individual recombination cassettes or trpA-E genes along with regulatory elements with the integron system.

====Y-Ligation based shuffling (YLBS)====
This method generates single stranded DNA strands, which encompass a single block sequence either at the 5&#x27; or 3&#x27; end, complementary sequences in a stem loop region, and a D branch region serving as a primer binding site for PCR. Equivalent amounts of both 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; half strands are mixed and formed a hybrid due to the complementarity in the stem region. Hybrids with free phosphorylated 5&#x27; end in 3&#x27; half strands are then ligated with free 3&#x27; ends in 5&#x27; half strands using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP. Ligated products are then amplified by two types of PCR to generate pre 5&#x27; half and pre 3&#x27; half PCR products. These PCR product are converted to single strands via avidin-biotin binding to the 5&#x27; end of the primes containing stem sequences that were biotin labeled. Next, biotinylated 5&#x27; half strands and non-biotinylated 3&#x27; half strands are used as 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; half strands for the next Y-ligation cycle.

== Semi-rational design ==
Semi-rational design uses information about a proteins sequence, structure and function, in tandem with predictive algorithms. Together these are used to identify target amino acid residues which are most likely to influence protein function. Mutations of these key amino acid residues create libraries of mutant proteins that are more likely to have enhanced properties.

Advances in semi-rational enzyme engineering and de novo enzyme design provide researchers with powerful and effective new strategies to manipulate biocatalysts. Integration of sequence and structure based approaches in library design has proven to be a great guide for enzyme redesign. Generally, current computational de novo and redesign methods do not compare to evolved variants in catalytic performance. Although experimental optimization may be produced using directed evolution, further improvements in the accuracy of structure predictions and greater catalytic ability will be achieved with improvements in design algorithms. Further functional enhancements may be included in future simulations by integrating protein dynamics.

Biochemical and biophysical studies, along with fine-tuning of predictive frameworks will be useful to experimentally evaluate the functional significance of individual design features. Better understanding of these functional contributions will then give feedback for the improvement of future designs.

Directed evolution will likely not be replaced as the method of choice for protein engineering, although computational protein design has fundamentally changed the way protein engineering can manipulate bio-macromolecules. Smaller, more focused and functionally-rich libraries may be generated by using in methods which incorporate predictive frameworks for hypothesis-driven protein engineering. New design strategies and technical advances have begun a departure from traditional protocols, such as directed evolution, which represents the most effective strategy for identifying top-performing candidates in focused libraries. Whole-gene library synthesis is replacing shuffling and mutagenesis protocols for library preparation. Also highly specific low throughput screening assays are increasingly applied in place of monumental screening and selection efforts of millions of candidates. Together, these developments are poised to take protein engineering beyond directed evolution and towards practical, more efficient strategies for tailoring biocatalysts.

== Screening and selection techniques ==
Once a protein has undergone directed evolution, ration design or semi-ration design, the libraries of mutant proteins must be screened to determine which mutants show enhanced properties. Phage display methods are one option for screening proteins. This method involves the fusion of genes encoding the variant polypeptides with phage coat protein genes. Protein variants expressed on phage surfaces are selected by binding with immobilized targets in vitro. Phages with selected protein variants are then amplified in bacteria, followed by the identification of positive clones by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. These selected phages are then subjected to DNA sequencing.

Cell surface display systems can also be utilized to screen mutant polypeptide libraries. The library mutant genes are incorporated into expression vectors which are then transformed into appropriate host cells. These host cells are subjected to further high throughput screening methods to identify the cells with desired phenotypes.

Cell free display systems have been developed to exploit &quot;in vitro&quot; protein translation or cell free translation. These methods include mRNA display, ribosome display, covalent and non covalent DNA display, and &quot;in vitro&quot; compartmentalization. 

===Enzyme engineering===
Enzyme engineering is the application of modifying an enzyme&#x27;s structure (and, thus, its function) or modifying the catalytic activity of isolated enzymes to produce new metabolites, to allow new (catalyzed) pathways for reactions to occur, or to convert from certain compounds into others (biotransformation). These products are useful as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fuel, food, or agricultural additives.

An &quot;enzyme reactor&quot; consists of a vessel containing a reactional medium that is used to perform a desired conversion by enzymatic means. Enzymes used in this process are free in the solution. Also Microorganisms are one of important origin for genuine enzymes .

== Examples of engineered proteins ==
Computing methods have been used to design a protein with a novel fold, such as Top7, and sensors for unnatural molecules. The engineering of fusion proteins has yielded rilonacept, a pharmaceutical that has secured Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treating cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome.

Another computing method, IPRO, successfully engineered the switching of cofactor specificity of &quot;Candida boidinii&quot; xylose reductase. Iterative Protein Redesign and Optimization (IPRO) redesigns proteins to increase or give specificity to native or novel substrates and cofactors. This is done by repeatedly randomly perturbing the structure of the proteins around specified design positions, identifying the lowest energy combination of rotamers, and determining whether the new design has a lower binding energy than prior ones.

Computation-aided design has also been used to engineer complex properties of a highly ordered nano-protein assembly. A protein cage, E. coli bacterioferritin (EcBfr), which naturally shows structural instability and an incomplete self-assembly behavior by populating two oligomerization states, is the model protein in this study. Through computational analysis and comparison to its homologs, it has been found that this protein has a smaller-than-average dimeric interface on its two-fold symmetry axis due mainly to the existence of an interfacial water pocket centered on two water-bridged asparagine residues. To investigate the possibility of engineering EcBfr for modified structural stability, a semi-empirical computational method is used to virtually explore the energy differences of the 480 possible mutants at the dimeric interface relative to the wild type EcBfr. This computational study also converges on the water-bridged asparagines. Replacing these two asparagines with hydrophobic amino acids results in proteins that fold into alpha-helical monomers and assemble into cages as evidenced by circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy. Both thermal and chemical denaturation confirm that, all redesigned proteins, in agreement with the calculations, possess increased stability. One of the three mutations shifts the population in favor of the higher order oligomerization state in solution as shown by both size exclusion chromatography and native gel electrophoresis.

A &quot;in silico&quot; method, PoreDesigner, was developed to redesign bacterial channel protein (OmpF) to reduce its 1 nm pore size to any desired sub-nm dimension. Transport experiments on the narrowest designed pores revealed complete salt rejection when assembled in biomimetic block-polymer matrices.

<doc id="216113" wikidata="Q3460989" url="?curid=216113" title="Quebec French profanity">
<text>Quebec French profanities, known as  (singular: ; from the verb , &quot;to consecrate&quot;), are words and expressions related to Catholicism and its liturgy that are used as strong profanities in Quebec French (the main variety of Canadian French), Acadian French (spoken in Maritime Provinces, east of Quebec, a portion of Aroostook County, Maine, in the United States), and traditionally French-speaking areas across Canada. are considered stronger in Québec than the foul expressions common to other varieties of French, which centre on sex and excrement (such as , &quot;shit&quot;).

==History==
The originated in the early 19th century, when the social control exerted by the Catholic clergy was increasingly a source of frustration. One of the oldest is , which can be thought of as the Franco-Canadian equivalent of the English &quot;goddamn it&quot;. It is known to have been in use as early as the 1830s. The word in its current meaning is believed to come from the expression (&quot;Don&#x27;t say that, it is sacred/holy&quot;). Eventually, started to refer to the words Quebecers were not supposed to say. This is likely related to the commandment &quot;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain&quot; (Exodus 20:7). The influence and social importance of Catholicism at that time allowed to become powerful forms of profanity.

As a result of the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s, the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec has declined but the profanity still remains in use today. 

==List of common ==
These are commonly given in a phonetic spelling to indicate the differences in pronunciation from the original word, several of which (notably, the deletion of final consonants and change of to before ) are typical of informal Quebec French. The nouns here can also be modified for use as verbs (see &quot;Non-profane uses&quot;, below). Additionally, some forms, notably and , can become semi-adjectival when followed by , as in (Scram, you fucking cat!); is often added at the end for extra emphasis.

Often, several of these words are strung together when used adjectivally, as in (see &quot;Intricate forms&quot;, below) and many combinations are possible. Since swear words are voluntarily blasphemous, the spellings are usually different from the words from which they originate. For example, can be written , , , , and so on. There is no general agreement on how to write these words, and the Office québécois de la langue française does not regulate them. 
* : &quot;baptism&quot;
* (): &quot;chalice&quot;
* : &quot;ciborium&quot; or &quot;pyx&quot;, receptacles in which the host is stored
* (&quot;Christ&quot;): &quot;Christ&quot;, or , a more emphatic version of , both verbs meaning &quot;to curse&quot;
* , or (&quot;hostie&quot;): &quot;host&quot;
* (m) or (f): &quot;damned&quot; (or &quot;damn&quot;)
* (): &quot;Sacrament&quot;
* : &quot;Saint&quot;, added before others (ex. , , etc.)
* (): from the sin of simony
* (): &quot;tabernacle&quot;; typically considered the most profane of the 
* (): &quot;the Virgin Mary&quot;

===Mild forms===
Most have modified, milder euphemistic forms (see minced oath). Such forms are not usually considered nearly as rude as the original. They are the equivalent of English words such as &quot;gosh&quot;, &quot;heck&quot;, or &quot;darn&quot;. Many of the euphemistic forms are only similar-sounding to religious terms, so are considered not to denigrate the Church directly.
* : 
* : (from the English &quot;cream puff&quot;), 
* : (from the English &quot;Moses&quot;)
* : (anagram of ), (merge of and ), 

The following are also considered milder profanity:

* : &quot;bastard&quot;
* : &quot;boob&quot;, used to denote a breast or a complete idiot
* (): &quot;harm to God&quot;
* (): &quot;shit&quot;, used in conjunction with other words, sometimes profanity: , , , , , , or , 
* : a mix between and 

Sometimes older people unable to bring themselves to swear with church words or their derivatives would make up ostensibly innocuous phrases, such as (literally, &quot;five or six boxes of green tomatoes&quot;, being slang for , &quot;green&quot;). This phrase when pronounced quickly by a native speaker sounds like (&quot;holy ciborium of the tabernacle&quot;). Another example of a benign word that is church sounding is , which was simply an anglicism for &quot;coal-tar&quot;, but pronounced just so, sounds like a merged and (&quot;harm&quot;).

===Intricate forms===

In Québec French, swear words can be combined into more powerful combinations to express extreme anger or disgust. These intricate uses of French profanities can be difficult to master. The combinations are endless; some people in both Quebec and francophone communities in other provinces consider mixing and matching swear words to be a sort of skilled art.

* or : means &quot;to fuck something up&quot;; comes from the derived noun , which refers to an animal&#x27;s throat or maw, but is used in to mean the human mouth or face. The whole sentence can be summarized as &quot;I&#x27;m gonna beat your fucking face in, you motherfucker&quot;.
* : Very strong expression of anger. Can also be used as a descriptive phrase expressing anger or derision: , (&quot;Jesus fucking Christ, there&#x27;s no way you can be this stupid&quot;).
* : Expressive of extreme anger.
* : Expressive of very extreme anger.
* : Denotes extreme apathy and suppressed anger, similar to the English &quot;I don&#x27;t give a fuck&quot;. : &quot;I don&#x27;t give a fuck about politicians.&quot;
* : Expression of anger aimed at someone perceived to be lacking in intellectual acumen; (&quot;thick&quot;) is used as a derogatory term meaning &quot;idiot&quot;, with (&quot;Eucharist&quot;) and (&quot;of shit&quot;) acting as intensifiers

==Use==
A very strong way to express anger or frustration is to use the words , , and . Depending on the context and the tone of the phrases, it might make everybody quiet, but some people use these words to add rhythm or emphasis to sentences.

Usually, more than one of these words is used in Franco-Canadian profanity. The words are simply connected with (&quot;of&quot;), without any restrictions. Long strings of invective can be connected in this way, and the resulting expression does not have to have any concrete meaning—for example, (literally, &quot;My host of (the) holy sacrament of (the) chalice of Christ&quot;). Non-religious terms may also be strung together in this way, as in (literally, &quot;My Christ of (a) car is broken, chalice of (the) tabernacle&quot;). In areas where English is also commonly spoken, English expletives are often inserted. (&quot;Fuck [the] host&quot;) is common in Quebec.

The adjective (with meanings varying from &quot;crazy, disturbed&quot; to &quot;broken down&quot;) is much milder than &quot;fucked&quot; is in English. It is routinely used in, for instance, TV sitcom dialogue. The same goes for &quot;shit&quot; (which in Quebec French is used only as an interjection expressing dismay, never as the noun for excrement). When used as a verb, (literally, &quot;Go shit&quot;), means not to excrete but rather to &quot;fuck off&quot;. When used in the past-tense , it is used exactly as : (&quot;My shoes are fucked&quot;, literally: &quot;My shoes are shitted&quot;).

Even English-language dialogue containing these words can appear on Quebec French-language television without bleeping. For example, in 2003, when punks rioted in Montreal because a concert by the band The Exploited had been cancelled, TV news reporters solemnly read out a few lyrics and song titles from their album &quot;Fuck the System&quot;. The same is not true of Quebec&#x27;s English-language television stations, which follow the same guidelines as other stations in Canada. In November 2017 the CRTC ruled that &quot;fuck&quot; is not a swear word in French.

==Non-profane uses==
A slang term with the preposition means &quot;a lot of&quot;: (or , etc.) means &quot;a lot of food&quot;, similar to English constructs such as &quot;fuck-ton&quot; or &quot;shitload&quot;.

 are often used as verbs too. For example, means &quot;to beat the fuck out of&quot;, &quot;to kick one&#x27;s ass&quot; or, more literally, &quot;to give a beating&quot;, where is used as a stronger form of &quot;to give&quot; ( in French). There are constructions like or , which means &quot;to leave&quot; or &quot;to destroy&quot;, using the prefix, which is about separation. Others include or (&quot;to not give a damn&quot;), or (&quot;to run away&quot;), and . Some are even found as adverbs, such as , meaning &quot;very&quot; or &quot;extremely&quot;, as in (&quot;This is really good&quot;). or can mean &quot;extremely angry&quot;.

In the movie &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot;, Quebec actor and stand-up comic Patrick Huard&#x27;s character teaches Colm Feore&#x27;s how to swear properly.

These expressions are found less commonly in literature, but rappers and other singers often use and as a rhyme. More traditional singers also use these words, such as Quebec singer Plume Latraverse.

One fine example of the use of as different word classes is a dialogue by called . The phrase (&quot;Jules, who was irritated, violently ejected Jacques, who was angry.&quot;) becomes (&quot;That fucker, who was pissed off, kicked out that dickhead, who was fucking furious.&quot;) with each content word (noun, verb, adjective or adverb) replaced with a profane synonym. This usage of is similar to the form of Russian swearing known as .
==Possible Protestant origin==

The expression of ideas linked to the Protestant (Huguenot) faith can be considered, looking at both the initial meaning expressed by the swear words and the geographic origin of the settlers of New-France. 

Since the roughly twenty initial words have generated close to four-hundred euphemisms and thousands of set constructions, all equally present in all regions of Quebec, it would make more sense to have them begin their development at an earlier time than the mid-nineteenth century. 

===Meaning=== 
The main Quebec swear words refer to aspects of Catholic worship and practice that Calvinists have historically rejected or objected to, including eucharistic adoration, transubstantiation, the Virgin Mary (viarge) and simony (simonaque). They are expressed in French rather than Latin. 

«The reformers unanimously rejected transubstantiation, … understand that words alone are not strong enough to illustrate this philosophy.» and «You have to understand the hatred they feel in the face of what they perceive as a fraud.»

===Settler origin===


About a third of the established settlers came from the Pays de Caux in the Northern part of Normandie «The Pays de Caux... formed a kind of triangle bounded by the port cities of Rouen, Dieppe and Le Havre. These three communities stand out as the only real points of concentration (settler provenance in Normandy)» also «The Pays de Caux housed probably the largest concentration of rural Protestants north of the Loire» and another third from the Poitou area (which includes Angoumois, Aunis, Saintonge), where lived France&#x27;s greatest concentrations of Huguenots at that time.

This fact has already been noted in a different context «The geographical areas where women were recruited coincide with the Protestant areas.»

It appears that throughout the New-France period, settlement originated from French Protestants strongholds as the increasing pressure from the Counter-Reformation made it harder and harder for them to live in France. This would suggest that Quebec swear words were originally an expression of their religious principles. 

==Comparison to other languages==
The use of liturgical profanity is not unique to Canadian French or Quebec. In Italian, although to a lesser extent, some analogous words are in use: in particular, (host) and (more so in the past) are relatively common expressions in the northeast, which are lighter (and a little less common) than the typical blasphemies in use in Italy, such as (pig god) and (see Italian profanity). Modifying the terms into euphemistic equivalents is used in Italy; for example, is commonly modified to (a type of restaurant). The word has produced the verb , which colloquially means &quot;to use blasphemy&quot;.

Other dialects in the world feature this kind of profanity, such as the expressions and in Austro-Bavarian and in Czech. is an expletive expression in some Spanish dialects. In Catalan, is used and is frequently abbreviated to . Spanish also uses (&quot;I shit on ...&quot;) followed by &quot;God&quot;, &quot;the blessed chalice&quot;, &quot;the Virgin&quot; and other terms, religious or not. It can be shortened to just or (&quot;Blessed chalice!&quot;). In Romanian, the profanity (&quot;Your mother&#x27;s host!&quot;) is sometimes used with &quot;Easter&quot;, &quot;Christ&quot;, &quot;Cross&quot;, &quot;Commemoration&quot; (), &quot;sacred oil lamp&quot; (), &quot;God&quot;, &quot;Church&quot;, etc.

Sheila Fischman&#x27;s translation of &quot;La Guerre, yes Sir!&quot; (published under that title in French and English and meaning roughly &quot;War, you bet!&quot;), by Roch Carrier, leaves many in the original Quebec French, since they have no real equivalent in English. She gives a brief explanation and history of these terms in her introduction, including a few not listed here. At a crucial point in the story, a boy swears in the presence of his father. For the first time, instead of beating or punishing his son, the father swears back. This represents the boy&#x27;s passage into manhood.

Irish Catholics of old employed a similar practice, whereby &quot;ejaculations&quot; were used to express frustration without cursing or profaning (taking the Lord&#x27;s name in vain). This typically involved the recitation of a rhyming couplet, where a shocked person might say, &quot;Jesus who, for love of me / Died on the Cross at Calvary&quot; instead of &quot;Jesus!&quot; This is often abbreviated simply to &quot;Jesus-hoo-fer-luv-a-me&quot;, an expression still heard among elderly Irish people. &quot;Jesus, Mary and Joseph!&quot; is used in Quebec French: 

Hungarians, primarily Catholics, follow the same suit: instead of (God) or as a curse, (the God of it!), they often use another word which also begins with : (the school of it!) or (the stable of it!).

<doc id="216114" wikidata="Q1349184" url="?curid=216114" title="Jerry Rubin">
<text>Jerry Clyde Rubin (July 14, 1938 – November 28, 1994) was an American social activist, anti-war leader, and counterculture icon during the 1960s and early 1970s. Despite being known for holding radical views when he was a political activist, he ceased holding his more extreme views at some point in the 1970s and instead opted for a successful career as a businessman. In the 1960s, during his political activism heyday, he was known for being one of the co-founders of the Youth International Party (YIP) whose members were referred to as Yippies, and standing trial in the Chicago Seven case.

==Early life and education==
Rubin was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Esther (Katz), a homemaker, and Robert Rubin, a trucker who later became a Teamsters&#x27; union official.

Rubin attended Cincinnati&#x27;s Walnut Hills High School, co-editing the school newspaper, &quot;The Chatterbox&quot; and graduating in 1956. While in high school Rubin began to write for &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot;, compiling sports scores from high school games. He attended Oberlin College, and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and later went on to graduate from the University of Cincinnati, receiving a degree in history. Rubin attended the University of California, Berkeley in 1964 but dropped out to focus on social activism.

Rubin&#x27;s parents died within ten months of each other, leaving Rubin to take care of his younger brother, Gil, who was 13 at the time. Jerry wanted to teach Gil about the world and planned to take him to India. When relatives threatened to sue to obtain custody of Gil, Jerry decided to take his brother to Israel instead, settling in Tel Aviv. There, Rubin worked on a kibbutz, and studied sociology while his brother, who had learned Hebrew, decided to stay in Israel and moved permanently to a kibbutz. Before returning to social and political activism, Rubin made a visit to Havana, to learn first-hand about the Cuban revolution.

==Social activism==
Rubin began to demonstrate on behalf of various left-wing causes after dropping out of UC Berkeley. Rubin also ran for mayor of Berkeley, on a platform opposing the Vietnam War, and supporting Black power and the legalization of marijuana, receiving over 20 percent of the vote. Rubin turned his attention to political protest, his first in Berkeley, protesting against the refusal of a local grocer to hire African Americans. Soon Rubin was leading protests of his own. Rubin organized the Vietnam Day Committee, that led some of the first big protests against the Vietnam War. He took part in planning the world&#x27;s largest teach-in against the war, organized rallies and demonstrations that attempted to stop a train transporting troops to the Oakland Army Base, as well as trucks carrying napalm. The Vietnam Day Committee was a unique early antiwar organization in that it enjoyed large local participation and is believed to be a forerunner to the national movement against the war in Vietnam.

Rubin was one of the founding members of the Youth International Party (YIP) or Yippies, along with social and political activist Abbie Hoffman and satirist Paul Krassner. The Yippies were not a formal organization with a membership list or a direct relationship with constituency but played upon the media&#x27;s appetite for anything new and different. They were influenced by Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s ideas on the importance of electronic communication and believed that if radical events were made more entertaining the media, especially television would give them greater coverage.

As Rubin recollected:

... [T]he more visual and surreal the stunts we could cook up, the easier it would be to get on the news, and the more weird and whimsical and provocative the theater, the better it would play.

Rubin&#x27;s appearance before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings is a good example of the Yippies’ emphasis on conducting political protest as theater, and drawing as much attention as possible to their dissent by turning it into a spectacle. Rubin was subpoenaed by HUAC in Washington but instead of pleading the Fifth Amendment as was common, he entered the room dressed in a rented 18th-century American Revolutionary War uniform, proudly claiming to be a descendant of Jefferson and Paine. &quot;Nothing is more American than revolution,&quot; he told the committee. Rubin, showing a total lack of concern or worries, lightheartedly blew soap bubbles as members of Congress questioned his Communist affiliations. He subsequently appeared before the HUAC as a bare-chested guerrilla in Viet Cong pajamas, with war paint and carrying a toy M-16 rifle, and later as Santa Claus.

As Martin A. Lee and Bruce Shlain remark in their book &quot;Acid Dreams&quot;:

It was a political ploy designed to make a mockery of the HUAC proceedings; the congressmen were caught off guard, and Rubin&#x27;s stunt became page-one news throughout the country.

Another media stunt that gave the Yippies free publicity, not only in United States but all over the world, was when Rubin, Hoffman and others brought the New York Stock Exchange to a halt by tossing money into the air and watched gleefully as stockbrokers scrambled to collect bills.

Yet another successful act in Yippies &quot;guerrilla theater&quot; was when during the Democratic National Convention of 1968 the Youth International Party nominated their own candidate for the presidency. The nominee was Pigasus the Immortal, a 145-pound (66 kg) pig that they felt was an appropriate alternative to Richard Nixon, Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Alabama governor George Wallace. At the official introductions at Pigasus&#x27; first press conference, Rubin, while holding the candidate in his arms, demanded he be given Secret Service protection and be brought to the White House for a foreign policy briefing. He also promised, on behalf of Pigasus, a fair election campaign and if Pigasus won the election he would be eaten. This would, maintained Rubin, reverse the usual democratic process in which the pig is elected &quot;and proceeds to eat the people.&quot;

In his book &quot;DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution&quot; Rubin says &quot;media does not &quot;report&quot; &quot;news,&quot; it creates it. An event &quot;happens&quot; when it goes on TV and becomes a myth.&quot; He goes on to say:

TV time goes to those with the most guts and imagination. I never understood the radical who comes on TV in a suit and tie. Turn off the sound and he could be the mayor! The &quot;words&quot; may be radical, but the television is a non-verbal instrument! The way to understand TV is to shut off the sound. No one remembers any words they hear; the mind is a technicolor movie of images, not words. I&#x27;ve never seen &quot;bad&quot; coverage of a demonstration. It makes no difference what they &quot;say&quot; about us. The picture is the story.

In October 1967, David Dellinger of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam asked Rubin to help mobilize and direct a March on the Pentagon. The protesters gathered at the Lincoln Memorial as Dellinger and Dr. Benjamin Spock gave speeches to the mass of people.

From there, the group marched towards the Pentagon. As the protesters neared the Pentagon, they were met by soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division. who formed a human barricade blocking the Pentagon steps. Not to be dissuaded, Hoffman vowed to levitate the Pentagon while Allen Ginsberg led Tibetan chants to assist. Eventually, things turned ugly. By the time the group&#x27;s 48-hour permit expired, approximately 680 protesters had been jailed and 50 hospitalized.

As one member of the march recalled:

In spite of the brutality of the police, the spirits of the demonstrators were not dampened. Many were exhilarated by what had transpired and some felt it was an event that would mark a turning point. &quot;It made me see we could build a movement by knocking off American symbols,&quot; said Rubin. He added:

Rubin later played an instrumental role in the anti-war demonstration that accompanied the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago by helping to organize the Yippie &quot;Festival of Life&quot; in Lincoln Park. He spoke along with Hoffman at an anti-war rally at the Grant Park bandshell on August 28, 1968, and instructed demonstrators to resist if a riot broke out. The extent of violence between Chicago police and demonstrators (which an official government report called a &quot;police riot&quot;) was not anticipated by the Yippie leaders. Some 1,500 people were injured. The arrest and trial of the Yippie leaders (known later as the Chicago Conspiracy Trial) which began on September 24, 1969, eventually led to the trial of Rubin and seven others on charges of incitement to riot, including Hoffman, Rennie Davis, John Froines, David Dellinger, Lee Weiner, Tom Hayden, and Bobby Seale.

The defendants were commonly referred to as the &quot;Chicago Eight&quot;. Seale&#x27;s trial was severed from the others after he demanded the right to serve as his own lawyer and was sentenced to four years in prison for contempt of court, making the Chicago Eight the Chicago Seven. The trial developed into a quiet spectacle, or &quot;hippie-guerillas theater&quot; as Rubin described it. Rubin, Hoffman and other defendants made a mockery of the court, widely covered by the press, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporting on it. Rubin, who had declared the trial to be &quot;the Academy Award of protest&quot; at one point paraded back and forth in front of Judge Julius Hoffman (no relation to defendant Hoffman), thrusting his arm in a Nazi salute and shouting &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot; Another time he and Hoffman wore judge&#x27;s robes to court. Judge Hoffman ordered both men to remove the robes. They did – but underneath they wore blue Chicago police shirts. &quot;The day Abbie and I came in wearing judges&#x27; robes was a stoned idea,&quot; Rubin said later. &quot;It was a turning point in the trial in terms of theatrics, and it just went on from there.&quot;

In spite of the danger of being busted, Rubin smoked marijuana before the trial. &quot;I got stoned a lot for the trial because it was such complete theater – a front-row seat to history – and marijuana intensifies every experience.&quot; Judge Hoffman added to the spectacle. Among other things, Judge Hoffman ordered for Black Panther leader Bobby Seale to be bound, gagged, and chained to his chair for a sizable portion of the trial.

Rubin, along with the six other defendants, was found not guilty on the charge of conspiracy but guilty (with four other defendants) on the charge of incitement. He was also sentenced by the judge to more than three years in prison for contempt of court. All of the convictions for incitement were later overturned by an appeals court, who cited judicial and prosecutorial misconduct. The contempt of court citations were also overturned on appeal. The contempt charges were re-tried in 1972 however the U.S. Justice Department declined to retry any of the defendants for either conspiracy or incitement.

The Vietnam War politicized marijuana, turning it from a sign of an immoral or corrupt person, suffering from amotivational syndrome (psychological condition associated with diminished inspiration to participate in social activities) into deliberate, calculated civil disobedience.

Jerry Rubin remarked in 1970:

Smoking pot makes you a criminal and a revolutionary. As soon as you take your first puff, you are an enemy of society.

In 1972, Rubin continued his activism, this time in Miami Beach to organize protests for both the Republican and Democratic Conventions. This time, the local community knew the Yippies were coming and they organized behind a Rubin of their own, Ellis Rubin, a well-known attorney. On June 4, 1972, the Rubins debated at the Unitarian Church in Miami, in front of 500 highly charged churchgoers on both sides of the issue, only divided by a church aisle. Jerry began the debate by thanking &quot;Uncle Ellis&quot; for the invitation to debate. Ellis, who was not related to Jerry, feigned disgust at the association and the event was &quot;on&quot;. After barbs in both directions, it ended abruptly when Jerry famously dropped an &quot;F-bomb&quot; and Ellis took leave to lead the locals out in a protest of their own.

Rubin was also interviewed on television by journalist Dorothy Fuldheim about his book &quot;Do It&quot;. In the interview, Rubin started to quiz Fuldheim, asking her if she drank. He then referred to the police as &quot;pigs,&quot; which offended Fuldheim, who replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a shock for you. I&#x27;m very friendly with policemen.&quot; Rubin responded &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve got a shock for you. I&#x27;m very friendly with the Black Panther Party.&quot; At this, Fuldheim threw her book and kicked Rubin off the set saying &quot;Out! Stop the interview&quot; as the cameras rolled.

==Post-activism==
Rubin held a post-election party at his home in New York in January 1973, attended by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, after Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern had lost to Republican incumbent President Richard Nixon at the 1972 presidential election. Soon after, Rubin retired from politics entirely, becoming an entrepreneur and businessman.

In the 1980s, Rubin was now more known for being a Yuppie capitalist. Despite no longer maintaining the more radical counterculture views he once held and being regarded as a sellout by some of his former 1960s associates, it has been acknowledged that Rubin sought to use his business investments to promote social awareness. He embarked on a debating tour with Abbie Hoffman titled &quot;Yippie versus Yuppie&quot;. Rubin&#x27;s argument in the debates was that activism was hard work and that the abuse of drugs, sex, and private property had made the counterculture &quot;a scary society in itself.&quot; He maintained that: 
A later political cartoon portrayed Rubin as half-guerrilla and half-businessman.

Rubin&#x27;s differences with Hoffman were on principle rather than completely personal. However, it was acknowledged that his evolving views did not sit well with Hoffman. When Hoffman died by suicide in 1989, Rubin attended his funeral.

In his memoir &quot;Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven&quot; Rubin emphasizes the importance of uniting the personal and the political. He writes:

==Other appearances==

Jerry Rubin appeared posthumously in the 2002 British documentary by Adam Curtis, &quot;The Century of the Self&quot;. He appears in episode part 3 of 4. This segment of the documentary discusses the Erhard Seminars Training, also known as The &quot;est&quot; Training, of which Rubin was a graduate. In his autobiography &quot;Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven&quot; Rubin dedicates a chapter on his experience of taking the est Training. He explains why est appealed to him, even though he had initially resisted it:

Rubin also appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s second episode of its first season. He was announced as &quot;Jerry Rubin, Leader of the Yippie Movement.&quot; The sketch is a fake commercial for wallpaper featuring famous protest slogans from the 1960s and 1970s (e.g., &quot;Make Love, Not War&quot;, &quot;Off The Pig!&quot;, &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot;, &quot;Hell No, We Won&#x27;t Go!&quot;, etc.). He ends the sketch by parodying a famous radical slogan as &quot;Up against the wall-paper, posters!&quot; (with the last word bleeped out in a reference to Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers).

==Author==
Rubin&#x27;s anti-establishment beliefs were put down in writing in his 1970 book, &quot;DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution&quot;, with an introduction by Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver and unconventional design by Quentin Fiore. In 1971, his journal, written while incarcerated in the Cook County Jail, was published under the title &quot;We are Everywhere.&quot; The book includes an inside view of the trial of the Chicago Seven, but otherwise focuses on the Weather Underground, the Black Panthers, LSD, women&#x27;s liberation and his view of a coming revolution.

In 1976, Rubin wrote the book &quot;Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven&quot;, which contained a chapter about his experience at an Erhard Seminars Training (EST) session, later included in the book &quot;American Spiritualities: A Reader&quot; (2001) edited by Catherine L. Albanese. In &quot;Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven&quot;, Rubin claims a rational society cannot be built by people who are out of touch with themselves and can&#x27;t even run their own lives rationally. Real political change will not happen unless people transform their own personal reality, and their own relationships. Much like Arthur Koestler in his collections of essays The Yogi and the Commissar, Rubin argues that political work and self-development has to go hand in hand. It was important, he said, that people &quot;lived&quot; the society they hoped to create.

As explained in &quot;Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven&quot; Rubin experimented with many self-improvement techniques to overcome his own personal defects, everything from the &quot;est&quot; training, hypnotism, meditation and yoga to rolfing, acupuncture, the Arica School, Gestalt therapy and the bioenergetic analysis of Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s pupil Alexander Lowen. In a review of the book Derek VanPelt comments on Rubin&#x27;s self quest:

In 1980, Rubin authored a self-help book with his wife, Mimi Leonard, entitled &quot;The War Between the Sheets: What&#x27;s Happening with Men in Bed and What Men and Women Are Doing About It&quot;. It was not well received.

==Business==
Sometime in the mid-1970s, Rubin reinvented himself as a businessman. Friend and fellow Yippie Stew Albert claimed Rubin&#x27;s new ambition was giving capitalists a social consciousness. In 1980 he began a new career on Wall Street as stockbroker with the brokerage firm John Muir &amp; Co. &quot;I know that I can be more effective today wearing a suit and tie and working on Wall Street than I can be dancing outside the walls of power,&quot; he said.

In the 1980s, he became known for his promotion of business networking, having created Business Networking Salons, Inc., a company that organized parties at the Studio 54 and Palladium nightclubs in Manhattan, where thousands of young professionals and entrepreneurs met and shared ideas. Near the end of his life, Rubin became interested in the science of life extension and was heavily involved in multi-level marketing of health foods and nutritional supplements. “In 1991, he and his family moved to Los Angeles,” according to an Observer.com profile of him, “where he became a successful independent marketer for a Dallas-based firm that sold a nutritional drink called Wow!, made with kelp, ginseng, and bee pollen. Ironically, Bobby Seale became one of his salesmen.”

==Death==
On November 14, 1994, Rubin was struck by a motorist as he attempted to cross Wilshire Boulevard, in front of his penthouse apartment in the Westwood area of Los Angeles, California. It was a Monday evening and weekday traffic was heavy, with three lanes moving in each direction. One motorist swerved to avoid Rubin, but a second driver, immediately behind the first, struck him. He was taken to the UCLA Medical Center, where he died of a heart attack two weeks later. He is interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

State Senator Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and fellow Chicago Seven member said after Rubin&#x27;s death:

He was a great life force, full of spunk, courage and wit. I think his willingness to defy authority for constructive purposes will be missed. Up to the end, he was defying authority.

==Popular culture==
*After Rubin&#x27;s 1994 death, &quot;Weekend Update&quot; host Norm Macdonald quipped, &quot;Yippie! Jerry Rubin died last week! Oh, I’m sorry, that should read, &#x27;Yippie Jerry Rubin died last week.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Jim Wickwire (born June 8, 1940) is the first American to summit K2, the second highest mountain in the world (summit at ). Wickwire is also known for surviving an overnight solo bivouac on K2 at an elevation above ; considered &quot;one of the most notorious bivouacs in mountaineering history&quot;.

==Early life==

Wickwire was raised in the small town of Ephrata, Washington, by James and Dorothy Wickwire. He played football for Ephrata High School and Columbia Basin College in Pasco, Washington, where he was part of an unbeaten team in 1961 that was later invited to the Junior Rose Bowl. Wickwire chose to leave football and enroll in Gonzaga University, where he graduated law school. He trained and has practiced as a lawyer.

==Mount Rainier and the Willis Wall==
Wickwire made several pioneering ascents of Mount Rainier&#x27;s foot Willis Wall in the 1960s and 1970s, which had remained unclimbed until 1961. His ascent in 1963, was the first up the wall&#x27;s East Rib. In 1970, he completed the first winter ascent of the Willis Wall. Wickwire&#x27;s other ascents of the Willis Wall occurred in 1971 and 1974.

==K2: summit and bivouac==

K2 has been termed the &quot;Savage Mountain&quot; in writings about its high altitude climbing. Its dangers include notorious weather conditions, stretches of technical climbing on rock and ice, marked cliff exposures, and enormous, high-altitude serac. It has the second-highest fatality rate among the &quot;eight thousanders&quot; for those who climb it; of every four people who have reached the summit, one has died trying. 

When Wickwire finally climbed K2 for the first time, seven climbers had already died there. His first attempt on K2 was in a 1975 expedition that broke down in disputes and never got above .

Wickwire reached the summit of K2 with Louis Reichardt on September 6, 1978. The pair took photos on the summit, and then Reichardt started his descent immediately because he had made the climb without supplemental oxygen. Wickwire lingered a little longer, with the intention of catching up. Upon his descent it was beginning to get dark however, and Wickwire did not have a headlamp. Concerned about being able to move safely in the dark, he decided to spend the night where he was, which was below the summit but above . Wickwire had done bivouacs before and knew he just needed to gut it out until daylight, which was risky because of the thin air and severe cold. Risks included hypoxia, hypothermia, frostbite, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema, and falling.

Wickwire did not have a tent, sleeping bag, or water. His oxygen ran out halfway through the night, and his gas stove became inoperable. His only protection, other than his immediate winter clothing, was a thin nylon bivvy sack, which is uninsulated but windproof and helps to retain body heat. He shivered uncontrollably from the extreme cold (estimated to be -35 °F) and kept slowly sliding down the slope. He was forced to get out of his sack to remedy the problem and discovered that he was at risk of sliding over an edge that rolled off to drop below. &quot;No one had ever survived a solo bivouac above twenty-seven thousand feet&quot;.

The next morning, John Roskelley and Rick Ridgeway found him continuing down while on their way to the summit. Wickwire lost parts of two toes and underwent lung surgery due to blood clots on his lungs (pulmonary emboli); he also caught pneumonia and pleurisy. The Pakistani army helicoptered Wickwire right from the glacier at the bottom of the mountain, and Wickwire immediately underwent lung surgery. The surgeon expressed uncertainty about Wickwire&#x27;s ever climbing at high altitudes again. Nevertheless, Wickwire continued high-altitude climbing a couple of years later, climbing the slopes of Alaska&#x27;s Denali in preparation for his climbing expedition on Mount Everest.

==Crevasse on Denali==
In 1981, Wickwire was traversing a glacier on Denali, with 25-year-old Mount Rainier guide Chris Kerrebrock in the lead. They were roped together and dragging a sled. Glaciers often have deep crevasses, which can be concealed by thin layers of snow. A crevasse opened up beneath Kerrebrock who fell in headfirst, pulling Wickwire and the sled in on top of him, since they were roped together. Wickwire was able to slowly climb out with an ice axe but was unable to rescue Kerrebrock, who was alive but wedged in tightly, still wearing his backpack and upside down. (Kerrebrock couldn&#x27;t feel his hand when Wickwire touched it.) Wickwire had broken his shoulder, but slowly scaled the ice walls of the crevasse, six inches at a time, with his ice axe and crampons. Once upon the rim surface he attempted to dislodge Kerrebrock, who was still very much conscious, by pulling forcefully on the rope. Wickwire then descended on rope anchored to a snow picket, and attempted moving Kerrebrock&#x27;s tightly wedged backpack from within the crevasse, but all efforts were futile. Resigned to Kerrebrock&#x27;s fate, the two men said their goodbyes. Kerrebrock subsequently died late in the night. (Kerrebrock had instructed Wickwire to leave it up to his father to decide whether to leave his body in the crevasse or not. Wickwire led park rangers to the site, and they extracted Kerrebrock from the location.)

Upon getting down from the mountain, which took several days and was fraught with more crevasse dangers, Wickwire was burdened by his guilt for months for being unable to save Kerrebrock. He thought about quitting the upcoming expedition to Mount Everest stating, &quot;the furthest thought in my mind was Everest at that point&quot;. His wife convinced him to think about it for a length of time before deciding one way or the other, so there would be no regrets down the road. Wickwire heeded his wife&#x27;s advice, and in 1982, he was climbing Everest&#x27;s slopes with the planned group for the expedition.

==North face Everest attempts==
Wickwire made four (unsuccessful) attempts on the north side of Mount Everest, in: 1982, 1984, 1993, and 2003. During the 1982 expedition, Wickwire formed a relationship with female climber Marty Hoey. While ascending Everest, one day Wickwire and Hoey were taking a brief rest on a slope within a steep and icy couloir at . When the two climbers above needed more rope Hoey got up to allow Wickwire to move into position to ascend. As she did so, something went wrong. As Wickwire explains:
Wickwire looked back at the fixed rope and saw Hoey&#x27;s open climbing waist harness still attached via a jumar. He couldn&#x27;t compute at first what had happened, but later realized that her harness strap had not held, because Hoey hadn&#x27;t threaded &quot;the end of her belt back through the buckle (the only way to assure it would not come loose)&quot;. Retracing the route down, Wickwire found one of her crampons, but her body was lost below in the mountain&#x27;s bergschrund. After Hoey&#x27;s death, the three remaining climbers of the expedition&#x27;s first summit team turned back.

== Other notable attempts ==
In 1995, Jim Wickwire, John Roskelley, Tim Macartney-Snape, Stephen Venables, and Charlie Porter attempted a new route on Monte Sarmiento, on the western shores of Tierra del Fuego. Wickwire and Porter were injured on the climb and did not reach the summit with Roskelley, Macartney-Snape, and Venables.

==Personal life==
At the time of Kerrebrock&#x27;s death, Wickwire had been working for 20 years to become &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most accomplished mountain climbers&quot;.

After his adventures came to a halt, Wickwire was still able to return to have a relationship with his wife, children, and now his grandchildren. His wife had supported him during the years that he was a risk taker in the mountains.

Wickwire is now a retired attorney living in Seattle, Washington.

==In media==

=== Books ===
* Wickwire has published an autobiography, &quot;Addicted to Danger: A Memoir about Affirming Life in the Face of Death&quot; (with Dorothy C. Bullitt).

===Film===
The film &quot;K2&quot; (1991) is based very loosely on Wickwire and Reichardt&#x27;s 1978 K2 summit; there are significant differences between the film and reality.

<doc id="216124" wikidata="Q530647" url="?curid=216124" title="Lady Constance Malleson">
<text>Lady Constance Malleson (24 October 1895 – 5 October 1975) was a British writer and actress (appearing as Colette O&#x27;Niel). The daughter of Hugh Annesley, 5th Earl Annesley, Malleson studied at the Royal Academy of Drama Art and was a popular theatre performer.

During her twenty-year acting career she appeared in numerous productions across the United Kingdom including several productions at prominent theaters in London&#x27;s West End and in Maurice Elvey&#x27;s 1918 silent film Hindle Wakes. Before retiring from acting Malleson wrote and produced &quot;The Way&quot; a three act starring Una O&#x27;Connor, Charles Carson, and Moyna Macgill.

Active in pacifist and social reform efforts, Malleson spent the remainder of her career traveling and writing. She released several novels and autobiographical accounts, including &quot;In the north : autobiographical fragments in Norway, Sweden, Finland, 1936-1946&quot; about her experiences in Scandinavia administering relief efforts in response to the Russo-Finnish War. Among her most notable releases is the 1933 novel &quot;The Coming Back&quot;. Though she denied the suggestion, it is understood as a roman à clef regarding Malleson&#x27;s relationship with philosopher and political activist Bertrand Russell, with whom she shared an interest in pacifism. Friends until Russell&#x27;s death, the pair were romantically involved from 1916 to 1920, during Malleson&#x27;s mutually open marriage to actor Miles Malleson.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Malleson was born Constance Mary Annesley on 24 October 1895 at Castlewellan Castle in Castlewellan, Northern Ireland. She was the youngest child of Hugh Annesley, 5th Earl Annesley, and his second wife Priscilla Cecilia Armytage-Moore. Annesley&#x27;s sister, Lady Clare Annesley, was a feminist and pacifist who stood as a Labour Party parliamentary candidate in the 1920s and 1930s. She also had two half siblings, Lady Mabel Annesley and Francis Annesley, 6th Earl Annesley, from her father&#x27;s first marriage to Mabel
Wilhelmina Frances Markham. Malleson was home schooled by tutors until her father&#x27;s death in 1908, at which time she was sent to Down House in Kent. Unimpressed with the school, she referred to it in her 1931 autobiography, &quot;After Ten&quot;, as &quot;Damned Hell&quot;, demonstrating an early contempt for aristocratic decorum.

===Career===
Annesley enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1913 after attending finishing school in Dresden and studying French in Paris. While there she met Miles Malleson, whom she married on 12 April 1915 at the age of 19. The couple divorced in December 1922 after Miles failed to comply with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights obtained by Constance on 15 May the same year. After graduating she spent the 1922 season with the Plymouth Repertory Theatre as lead actress. Malleson took up acting because she believed &quot;that every woman ought to be able to earn a living.&quot; She was concerned with fair wages for all actors, going on to speak publicly about the importance of securing the minimum wage of 3 pounds a week and payment for rehearsal for everyone, not just lead actors.

Malleson appeared in many West End productions, including &quot;The Orphans&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre, and at least one film, &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot;. She joined the Hull Repertory Theatre Company for the 1925 season appearing in several productions including &quot;Peter and Paul&quot; and &quot;Advertising April&quot;, alongside actor Colin Clive, and a C. K. Munro production of &quot;At Mrs. Beam&#x27;s&quot;. Malleson believed that the short run plays that define repertory theatre were important for the development of young dramatists because they provided an opportunity to see how an audience reacts to one&#x27;s work. In March 1928, Malleson produced a stage version of her three-act play &quot;The Way&quot; at the Arts Theatre Club in London. The cast, which included Una O&#x27;Connor and Charles Carson, was headed by Moyna Macgill in the role of Rosaleen Moore, a part written for her by Malleson. The play, which debuted on 25 March, was performed twice and was reviewed by &quot;The Times&quot; as a &quot;pretentious sham!&quot;

During the First World War, her pacifist opinions brought her into contact with Bertrand Russell. The pair met in 1916 at a trial for Clifford Allen, then, chairman of the No-Conscription Fellowship. Having mutually agreed to an open marriage with her husband, Malleson and Russell carried on a relationship until 1920. During that time Russell struggled with how seriously Malleson took her career and her continued involvement with other men. Their affair eventually ended because she did not want children. The pair remained friends and corresponded until Russell&#x27;s death in 1970. He didn&#x27;t feel that acting made sufficient use of her talents and encouraged a writing career after she rejected his suggestion to become more politically active. It was Russell who submitted Malleson&#x27;s first published short story, &quot;The End&quot;, which was released in the September 1919 edition of the English Review under the pseudonym Christine Harte. Malleson eventually sold her letters from Russell and other mementos to McMaster University for inclusion in the Bertrand Russell Archives.

===Writing and travel===

After retiring from acting Malleson moved to the country, traveled and authored several books. Her autobiography was published in 1931 followed by her first novel, &quot;The Coming Back&quot; in 1933. Despite claiming it as fiction the work is considered a roman à clef regarding her relationship with Russell. Described by John G. Slater as a &quot;thinly disguised account&quot;, the novel features Russell as an astronomer from Cambridge, named Don Gregorio del Orellano, with other characters acting as stand ins for prominent people in Malleson&#x27;s relationship with Russell, including Dora Russell, Clifford Allen, T.S. Eliot and Maurice Elvey. Malleson would later disown the work claiming it to be a &quot;feeble first effort.&quot;

Malleson traveled extensively throughout her life including visits to the Middle East and Africa, in addition to frequent trips to the Nordic countries. She carried out lecture tours in the Nordic countries during the 1930s and 1940s, speaking on social reform topics including mental health and blood supply. In 1941, while working in Finland assist with relief efforts in response to the Russo-Finnish War, Malleson found herself stranded in a remote area of the country when the Germans took control of the country to fight Russian forces. She escaped by rowing 25 miles to Helsinki in a boat, where she was held for several days, before securing passage to Stockholm aboard a Swedish warship. Her time in the Nordic countries resulted in the publication of &quot;In the North: Autobiographical Fragments in Norway, Sweden, Finland&quot; in 1946.

===Death===

Malleson died in a nursing home near Bury St Edmunds on 5 October 1975.

<text>William Miles Malleson (25 May 1888 – 15 March 1969) was an English actor and dramatist, particularly remembered for his appearances in British comedy films of the 1930s to 1960s. Towards the end of his career he also appeared in cameo roles in several Hammer horror films, with a fairly large role in &quot;The Brides of Dracula&quot; as the hypochondriac and fee-hungry local doctor. Malleson was also a writer on many films, including some of those in which he had small parts, such as &quot;Nell Gwyn&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940). He also translated and adapted several of Molière&#x27;s plays (&quot;The Misanthrope&quot;, which he titled &quot;The Slave of Truth&quot;, &quot;Tartuffe&quot; and &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot;).

==Biography==
Malleson was born in Avondale Road, South Croydon, Surrey, England, the son of Edmund Taylor Malleson (1859-1909), a manufacturing chemist, and Myrrha Bithynia Frances Borrell (1863-1931), a descendant of the numismatist Henry Perigal Borrell and the inventor Francis Maceroni. (Miles&#x27; cousin and contemporary, Lucy Malleson, had a long career as a mystery novelist, mostly under the pen name &quot;Anthony Gilbert&quot;.)

He was educated at Brighton College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he created a sensation when it was discovered that he had successfully posed as a politician and given a speech instead of the visitor who had failed to attend a debating society dinner.

As an undergraduate, Malleson made his first stage appearance in November 1909, playing the slave Sosias in the biennial Cambridge Greek Play production of Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;The Wasps&quot; presented at the New Theatre, Cambridge.

He turned professional in November 1911. He studied acting at Herbert Beerbohm Tree&#x27;s Academy of Dramatic Art, which later was renamed the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Here he met his first wife in 1913.

In September 1914, he enlisted in the Army, and was sent to Malta, but was invalided home and discharged in January 1915. In late 1915, Malleson met Clifford Allen, who converted Malleson to pacifism and socialism. Malleson subsequently became a member of the peace organisation, the No-Conscription Fellowship. By June 1916 he was writing in support of conscientious objectors. Malleson wrote two anti-war plays, &quot;&quot;D&quot; Company&quot; and &quot;Black &#x27;Ell&quot;, the latter refused for performance in 1916 and only produced in the UK nine years later. When the plays were published in book form in 1916, copies were seized from the printers by the police, who described them as &quot;a deliberate calumny on the British soldier&quot;. 

Malleson was a supporter of the Bolshevik revolution and a founder member of the socialist 1917 Club in Soho. Another play of Malleson&#x27;s, &quot;Paddly Pools&quot;, (a children&#x27;s play with a socialist message) was frequently performed by British amateur dramatic groups in the period after World War I.

In the 1920s, Malleson became director of the Arts Guild of the Independent Labour Party. In this capacity Malleson helped establish amateur dramatics companies across Britain. The Arts Guild also helped stage plays by George Bernard Shaw, John Galsworthy and Laurence Housman, as well as Malleson&#x27;s own work. His 1934 play &quot;Six Men of Dorset&quot; (written with Harvey Brooks), about the Tolpuddle Martyrs, was later performed by local theatre groups under the guidance of the Left Book Club Theatre Guild.

Malleson had a receding chin and a sharp nose that produced the effect of a double chin. His manner was gentle and absent-minded; his voice, soft and high. He is best remembered for his roles as the Sultan in &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940), the poetically-inclined hangman in &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949), and as Dr. Chasuble in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1952). He was capable of excellent classical performances. For example, Sir John Gielgud noted that Malleson was &#x27;splendid&#x27; as Polonius in &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Failing eyesight led to his being unable to work in his last years, though he did write the subtitles for a filmed version of a Comédie Française production of &quot;Le Bourgeois gentilhomme&quot;, which was shown at the Academy Cinema in London in 1962 and in 1964 recorded &#x27;Indian Summer of an Uncle&#x27; and &#x27;Jeeves Takes Charge&#x27; with Roger Livesey, Terry-Thomas, Rita Webb, Avril Angers, and Judith Furse for the Caedmon Audio record label. 

He died in March 1969, following surgery to remove cataracts and was cremated in a private ceremony. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields during which Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Laurence Olivier gave readings.

==Family==
Malleson married three times and had many relationships. In 1915, he married writer and aspiring actress Lady Constance Malleson, who was also interested in social reform. Theirs was an open marriage and they divorced amicably in 1923 so that he could marry Joan Billson; they divorced in 1940. His third wife was Tatiana Lieven, whom he married in 1946 and from whom he had been separated for several years at the time of his death.

<text>The Vogelsbergkreis is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Hesse, Germany. Neighbouring districts are Schwalm-Eder, Hersfeld-Rotenburg, Fulda, Main-Kinzig, Wetteraukreis, Gießen and Marburg-Biedenkopf.

==History==
The district was created in 1972 by merging the former districts Alsfeld and Lauterbach.

==Geography==
The main feature of the district is the Vogelsberg, an extinct volcano, last active 7 million years ago.

==Coat of arms==
The lion in the bottom half is the lion of Hesse. The lilies in the upper part show the flowers of the martagon lily (German &quot;Türkenbund&quot;, &quot;Lilium martagon&quot;), a rare plant which grows in some protected areas of the district. The flowers were taken from the coat of arms of the Lauterbach district.

<text>The Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction (previously called Orange Prize for Fiction (1996–2006 &amp; 2009–12), Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction (2007–2008) and Baileys Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction (2014–2017)) is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most prestigious literary prizes, annually awarded to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English, and published in the United Kingdom in the preceding year. The prize was originally due to be launched in 1994 with the support of Mitsubishi but public controversy over the merits of the award caused the sponsorship to be withdrawn. Funding from Orange, a UK mobile network operator and Internet service provider, allowed the prize to be launched in 1996 by a committee of male and female &quot;journalists, reviewers, agents, publishers, librarians, booksellers&quot;, including current Honorary Director Kate Mosse.

In May 2012, it was announced that Orange would be ending its sponsorship of the prize. In 2012, the award was formally known as the &quot;Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction&quot;, and was sponsored by &quot;private benefactors&quot; led by Cherie Blair and writers Joanna Trollope and Elizabeth Buchan. In 2013, the new sponsor became Baileys. In January 2017 the company announced that it was the last year that they would sponsor the prize. In June 2017, the prize announced it would change its name to simply &quot;Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction&quot; starting in 2018, and will be supported by a family of sponsors.

The prize was established to recognise the contribution of female writers, whom Mosse believed were often overlooked in other major literary awards, and in reaction to the all-male shortlist for the 1991 Booker Prize. The winner of the prize receives £30,000, along with a bronze sculpture called the &quot;Bessie&quot; created by artist Grizel Niven, the sister of actor and writer David Niven. Typically, a longlist of nominees is announced around March each year, followed by a shortlist in June; within days the winner is announced. The winner is selected by a board of &quot;five leading women&quot; each year. In 2005, judges named Andrea Levy&#x27;s &quot;Small Island&quot; as the &quot;Orange of Oranges&quot;, the best novel of the preceding decade.

The BBC suggests that the prize forms part of the &quot;trinity&quot; of UK literary prizes, along with the Booker Prize and the Costa Book Awards; the sales of works by the nominees of these awards are significantly boosted. Levy&#x27;s 2004 winning book sold almost one million copies (in comparison to less than 600,000 for the Booker Prize winner of the same year), while sales of Helen Dunmore&#x27;s &quot;A Spell of Winter&quot; quadrupled after being awarded the inaugural prize. Valerie Martin&#x27;s 2003 award saw her novel sales increase tenfold after the award, and British libraries, who often support the prize with various promotions, reported success in introducing people to new authors: &quot;48% said that they had tried new writers as a result of the promotion, and 42% said that they would try other books by the new authors they had read.&quot;

However, the fact that the prize singles out female writers is not without controversy. After the prize was founded, Auberon Waugh nicknamed it the &quot;Lemon Prize&quot; while Germaine Greer claimed there would soon be a prize for &quot;writers with red hair&quot;. Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize, A. S. Byatt, called it a &quot;sexist prize&quot;, claiming &quot;such a prize was never needed.&quot; In 1999, the chairwoman of the judges, Lola Young, said that the British fiction they were asked to appraise fell into two categories, either &quot;insular and parochial&quot; or &quot;domestic in a piddling kind of way&quot;, unlike American authors who &quot;take small, intimate stories and set them against this vast physical and cultural landscape which is very appealing.&quot; Linda Grant suffered accusations of plagiarism following her award in 2000, while the following year, a panel of male critics produced their own shortlist and heavily criticised the genuine shortlist. Though full of praise for the winner of the 2007 prize, the chair of the judging panel Muriel Gray decried the fact that the shortlist had to be whittled down from &quot;a lot of dross&quot;, while former editor of &quot;The Times&quot; Simon Jenkins called it &quot;sexist&quot;. In 2008, writer Tim Lott called the award &quot;a sexist con-trick&quot; and said, &quot;the Orange Prize is sexist and discriminatory, and it should be shunned&quot;.

Barbara Kingsolver is the only author to have won the prize twice, doing so in 2010 for &quot;The Lacuna&quot; and in 2023 for &quot;Demon Copperhead&quot;. Margaret Atwood has been nominated three times without a win. Hilary Mantel was shortlisted three times without winning, for &quot;Beyond Black&quot; (2005) and the first two novels in her Tudor trilogy, &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2009) and &quot;Bring Up The Bodies&quot; (2012), which both won the Booker Prize. The third book in the trilogy, &quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot;, was shortlisted in April 2020, a year in which the award (usually given in May) was postponed to September. Since the inaugural award to Helen Dunmore, British writers have won five times, while North American authors have secured the prize ten times.

<doc id="216132" wikidata="Q1411762" url="?curid=216132" title="Scaled Composites">
<text>Scaled Composites (often called simply Scaled) is an American aerospace company founded by Burt Rutan and currently owned by Northrop Grumman. It is located at the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, United States. Founded to develop experimental aircraft, the company now focuses on designing and developing concept craft and prototype fabrication processes for aircraft and other vehicles. It is known for unconventional designs, for its use of non-metal, composite materials, and for winning the Ansari X Prize with its experimental spacecraft SpaceShipOne.

==Company history==
Scaled Composites was established in 1982 and purchased by the Beech Aircraft Corporation in 1985, as a result of the collaboration on the Starship project. In 1988, Beech&#x27;s parent company, Raytheon, sold Scaled back to Rutan, who then sold it to Wyman-Gordon. After Wyman-Gordon was acquired by Precision Castparts Corp., Rutan and ten investors re-acquired the company as Scaled Composites, LLC. Northrop Grumman, a major shareholder in the company with a 40% stake, said it would acquire the company outright on July 20, 2007. Both companies said Northrop Grumman&#x27;s acquisition would not affect Scaled Composites&#x27; strategy or involve replacing Burt Rutan as senior manager. The acquisition by Northrop Grumman was completed on August 24, 2007. Rutan retired in April 2011. Ben Diachun, a long time employee, was president of Scaled from Oct 31, 2015, until April 2019. Cory Bird, another long-time employee, became president of Scaled in April 2019.

===Early projects===
Before forming Scaled Composites, Burt Rutan had designed several aircraft for amateur builders, including the VariEze, often considered one of general aviation&#x27;s most innovative designs.

He also designed the Beechcraft Starship, which was a commercial failure. These aircraft were distinctive because of their canard configuration, winglets and pusher propellers.

In 2005, the single-jet GlobalFlyer was flown by billionaire adventurer Steve Fossett on the first solo non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world, and later in the longest flight in history: . It had been designed by Rutan, with aerodynamics by John Roncz, and built by Scaled Composites. as the Model 311.

Although their role was not widely publicized, Rutan and Roncz, who had provided aerodynamics support to a number of previous Rutan projects including Starship, helped design, and Scaled Composites manufactured, the double slotted wing mast for the &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; catamaran for Dennis Conner&#x27;s entry in the 1988 America&#x27;s Cup.

===SpaceShipOne===


The company announced in April 2003 that it was working on a privately funded spacecraft, in an attempt to win the Ansari X PRIZE for the first private crewed spaceflight. This experimental rocket-powered spacecraft was given the name SpaceShipOne. On December 17, 2003, they announced SpaceShipOne&#x27;s first supersonic flight, the first flight of its kind by a privately funded aircraft. SpaceShipOne successfully made this flight, reaching and 930 mph (Mach 1.2). The craft was taken aloft by the White Knight carrier aircraft. On the same day, Paul Allen, one of the founders of Microsoft, confirmed publicly the rumors that he was the angel investor behind the SpaceShipOne venture.

On April 1, 2004, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued the company what it called the world&#x27;s first license for a sub-orbital crewed rocket flight. The license was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which has backed licenses for more than 150 commercial launches of uncrewed launch vehicles in its 20 years, but never a license for crewed flight on a sub-orbital trajectory. The Mojave Airport, operating part-time as Mojave Spaceport, is the launch point for SpaceShipOne. SpaceShipOne performed the first privately funded human spaceflight on June 21, 2004. Flight 16P on September 29, 2004, and Flight 17P on October 4, 2004, won the X-Prize for Scaled Composites and SpaceShipOne.

===Stratolaunch Carrier Aircraft===
Scaled Composites Model 351 (nicknamed the &quot;Roc&quot;) was built for Stratolaunch Systems to provide a platform from which air-launch space missions can be staged.

In August 2015, Scaled Composites president Kevin Mickey stated the company had so far assembled &quot;roughly 200,000 pounds of composite structure&quot; for the vehicle and if put on a football field, &quot;its wingtips would extend beyond the goalposts by 15 feet on each side.&quot;

Each of the twin fuselages of the aircraft is long and is supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels. It requires 12,000 feet of runway to lift-off.

===Rutan Aircraft Factory aircraft===

Burt Rutan created Rutan Aircraft Factory to market a commercial variation of his Model &quot;VariViggen&quot; prototype&quot; he began building in his garage in 1968 which he called The Model 32, also known as the VariViggen SP. This model utilized a slightly longer fuselage, larger span and winglets in order to increase efficiency. Within 8 years after its founding, this company became one of the world&#x27;s important aircraft design and prototyping companies. The Rutan Aircraft Factory sold over 600 plan sets for the VariViggen to homebuilders, and eventually about 20 of the aircraft were built. Following the crash of one in New Brunswick, Canada, in September 2006 due to wing tank fuel contamination, fewer than five are currently still flying. The prototype aircraft, N27VV, was donated to the EAA AirVenture Museum in 1988.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On July 26, 2007, an explosion occurred during testing of SpaceShipTwo&#x27;s systems, killing three employees and injuring three more.
* On October 31, 2014, the SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise broke apart during an in-flight powered test. The incident killed one pilot and severely injured the other, resulting in the total loss of the vehicle; both pilots were Scaled Composites employees. On July 28, 2015, the NTSB released the final report on its investigation of the incident, concluding that for an unknown reason the pilot had released the &quot;Feather&quot; of SpaceShipTwo prematurely, leading directly to the craft&#x27;s disintegration.

<text>A railcar (not to be confused with the generic term railroad car or railway car) is a self-propelled railway vehicle designed to transport passengers. The term &quot;railcar&quot; is usually used in reference to a train consisting of a single coach (or carriage, car, unit), with a driver&#x27;s cab at one or both ends. In its simplest form, a &quot;railcar&quot; may also be little more than a motorized railway handcar, draisine or railbus.

Some railway companies, such as the Great Western, termed such vehicles &quot;railmotors&quot; (or &quot;rail motors&quot;). Self-powered railcars were once common in North America; and termed Doodlebugs.

Self-propelled passenger vehicles also capable of hauling a train are, in technical rail usage, more usually called &quot;rail motor coaches&quot; or &quot;motor cars&quot; (not to be confused with the motor cars, otherwise known as automobiles, that operate on roads).

== Alternative use ==
In Australia, the term is sometimes also used as an alternative name for the small types of multiple unit which consist of more than one coach. This can be the case in Ireland when referring to any diesel multiple unit (DMU), or in some cases electric multiple unit (EMU).

In North America the term &quot;railcar&quot; has a much broader sense and can be used (as an abbreviated form of &quot;railroad car&quot;) to refer to any item of hauled rolling-stock, whether passenger coaches or goods wagons (freight cars).

==Services==
Railcars are economic to run for light passenger loads because of their small size, and in many countries are often used to run passenger services on minor railway lines, such as rural railway lines where passenger traffic is sparse, and where the use of a longer train would not be cost effective. A famous example of this in the United States was the Galloping Goose railcars of the Rio Grande Southern Railroad, whose introduction allowed the discontinuance of steam passenger service on the line and prolonged its life considerably.

Railcars have also been employed on premier services. In New Zealand, although railcars were primarily used on regional services, the Blue Streak and Silver Fern railcars were used on the North Island Main Trunk between Wellington and Auckland and offered a higher standard of service than previous carriage trains.

In Australia, the &quot;Savannahlander&quot; operates a tourist service from the coastal town of Cairns to Forsayth, and Traveltrain operates the &quot;Gulflander&quot; between Normanton and Croydon in the Gulf Country of northern Queensland.

==Propulsion systems==

===Steam===

William Bridges Adams built steam railcars at Bow, London in the 1840s. Many British railway companies tried steam rail motors but they were not very successful and were often replaced by push-pull trains. Sentinel Waggon Works was one British builder of steam railcars.

In Belgium, M. A. Cabany of Mechelen designed steam railcars. His first was built in 1877 and exhibited at a Paris exhibition. This may have been the Exposition Universelle (1878). The steam boiler was supplied by the Boussu Works and there was accommodation for First, Second and Third-class passengers and their luggage. There was also a locker for dogs underneath. Fifteen were built and they worked mainly in the Hainaut and Antwerp districts.

The Austro-Hungarian Ganz Works built steam trams prior to the First World War. The Santa Fe Railway built a steam powered rail car using a body by American Car and Foundry, a Jacobs-Schupert boiler and a Ganz power truck in 1911. Numbered M-104, the experiment was a failure, and was not repeated.

===Petrol===
In 1904 the Automotor Journal reported that one railway after another had been realising that motor coaches could be used to handle light traffic on their less important lines. The North-Eastern railways had been experimenting “for some time” in this direction, and Wolseley provided them with a flat-four engine capable of up to for this purpose. The engine drove a main dynamo to power two electric drive motors, and a smaller dynamo to charge accumulators to power the interior lighting and allow electric starting of the engine. The controls for the dynamo allowed the coach to be driven from either end. For further details see 1903 Petrol Electric Autocar.

Another early railcar in the UK was designed by James Sidney Drewry and made by the Drewry Car Co. in 1906. In 1908 the manufacture was contracted out to the Birmingham Small Arms Company.

By the 1930s, railcars were often adapted from truck or automobiles; examples of this include the Buick- and Pierce-Arrow-based Galloping Geese of the Rio Grande Southern Railroad, and the Mack Truck-based &quot;Super Skunk&quot; of the California Western Railroad.

===Diesel===
While early railcars were propelled by steam and petrol engines, modern railcars are usually propelled by a diesel engine mounted underneath the floor of the coach. Diesel railcars may have mechanical (fluid coupling and gearbox), hydraulic (torque converter) or electric (generator and traction motors) transmission.

===Electric===
Electric railcars and mainline electric systems are rare, since electrification normally implies heavy usage where single cars or short trains would not be economic. Exceptions to this rule are or were found for example in Sweden or Switzerland. Some vehicles on tram and interurban systems, like the Red Car of the Pacific Electric Railway, can also be seen as railcars.

===Battery-electric===
Experiments with battery-electric railcars were conducted from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the US, railcars of the Edison-Beach type, with nickel-iron batteries were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a battery-electric Edison railcar operated from 1926 to 1934. In Ireland, the Drumm Battery Train used nickel-zinc batteries on four 2-car sets between 1932 and 1946 on the coastal and Harcourt Street railway lines. British Railways used lead–acid batteries in a railcar in 1958. Between 1955 and 1995 DB railways successfully operated 232 DB Class ETA 150 railcars utilising lead–acid batteries.

As with any other battery electric vehicle, the drawback is the limited range (this can be solved using overhead wires to recharge for use in places where there are not wires), weight, and/or expense of the battery.

==Old-generation railcars==
==New-generation DMU and EMU railcars==



A new breed of modern lightweight aerodynamically designed diesel or electric regional railcars that can operate as single vehicles or in trains (or, in “multiple units”) are becoming very popular in Europe and Japan, replacing the first-generation railbuses and second-generation DMU railcars, usually running on lesser-used main-line railways and in some cases in exclusive lanes in urban areas. Like many high-end DMUs, these vehicles are made of two or three connected units that are semi-permanently coupled as “married pairs or triplets” and operate as a single unit. Passengers may walk between the married pair units without having to open or pass through doors. Unit capacities range from 70 to over 300 seated passengers. The equipment is highly customisable with a wide variety of engine, transmission, coupler systems, and car lengths.

=== Institutional/regulatory Issues ===
Contrary to other parts of the world, in the United States these vehicles generally do not comply with Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations and, therefore, can only operate on dedicated rights-of-way with complete separation from other railroad activities. This restriction makes it virtually impossible to operate them on existing rail corridors with conventional passenger rail service. Nevertheless, such vehicles may soon operate in the United States as manufacturers such as Siemens, Alstom and ADtranz affirm they may be able to produce FRA-compliant versions of their European equipment.

=== Existing systems ===
Light regional railcars are used by a number of railroads in Germany, and also in the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, United States and Spain.
* Sprinter in San Diego, California
* Trillium Line in Ottawa, Canada
* Capital MetroRail in Austin, Texas
* A-train in Denton County, Texas
* SEPTA Cynwyd Line in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
* Ferrovia Trento-Malè in the region of Trento, Italy
* Ferrovia della Val Venosta in the province of South Tyrol, Italy &quot;(→ Italian language version)&quot;
* Ramal Talca-Constitución in the region of Maule, Chile

===Manufacturers===
Models of new-generation multiple-unit and articulated railcars include:
* Alstom Coradia LINT
* Bombardier Talent
* Metrovagonmash
* Siemens Desiro
* Stadler FLIRT
* Stadler GTW
* Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1

==Multiple-unit and articulated railcars==
When there are enough passengers to justify it, single-unit powered railcars can be joined in a multiple-unit form, with one driver controlling all engines. However, it has previously been the practice for a railcar to tow a carriage or second, unpowered railcar. It is possible for several railcars to run together, each with its own driver (as practised on the former County Donegal Railway). The reason for this was to keep costs down, since small railcars were not always fitted with multiple-unit control.

There are also articulated railcars, in which the ends of two adjacent coupled carriages are carried on a single joint bogie (see &quot;Jacobs bogie&quot;).

==Railbuses==

A variation of the railcar is the railbus: a very lightweight type of vehicle designed for use specifically on lightly-used railway lines and, as the name suggests, sharing many aspects of their construction with those of a road bus. They usually have a bus, or modified bus, body and four wheels on a fixed base, instead of running on bogies. Railbuses have been commonly used in such countries as the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

A type of railbus known as a Pacer based on the Leyland National bus was still widely used in the United Kingdom until withdrawal in 2021. New Zealand railcars that more closely resembled railbuses were the Leyland diesel railcars and the Wairarapa railcars that were specially designed to operate over the Rimutaka Incline between Wellington and the Wairarapa region. In Australia, where they were often called Rail Motors, railcars were often used for passenger services on lightly-used lines. In France they are known as autorails. Once very common, their use died out as local lines were closed. However, a new model has been introduced for lesser-used lines.

In Canada, after the cessation of their mainline passenger service, BC Rail started operating a pair of railbuses to some settlements not easily accessible otherwise.

In Russia, the Mytishchi-based Metrowagonmash firm manufactures the RA-1 railbus, equipped with a Mercedes engine. As of summer 2006, the Gorky Railway planned to start using them on its commuter line between Nizhny Novgorod and Bor.

=== Road–rail vehicles ===
The term &quot;railbus&quot; also refers to a dual-mode bus that can run on streets with rubber tires and on tracks with &quot;retractable&quot; train wheels.

The term &quot;rail bus&quot; is also used at times to refer to a road bus that replaces or supplements rail services on low-patronage railway lines or a bus that terminates at a railway station (also called a train bus). This process is sometimes called bustitution.

==Parry People Movers==
A UK company currently promoting the railbus concept is Parry People Movers. Locomotive power is from the energy stored in a flywheel. The first production vehicles, designated as British Rail Class 139, have a small onboard LPG motor to bring the flywheel up to speed. In practice, this could be an electric motor that need only connect to the power supply at stopping points. Alternatively, a motor at the stopping points could wind up the flywheel of each car as it stops.

==Draisine ==
The term &quot;railcar&quot; has also been used to refer to a lightweight rail inspection vehicle (or draisine).

<text>Theodore Francis Powys (20 December 1875 – 27 November 1953) – published as T. F. Powys – was a British novelist and short-story writer. He is best remembered for his allegorical novel &quot;Mr. Weston&#x27;s Good Wine&quot; (1927), where Weston the wine merchant is evidently God. Powys was influenced by the Bible, John Bunyan, Jonathan Swift and other writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as later writers such as Thomas Hardy and Friedrich Nietzsche.

==Biography==
Powys was born in Shirley, Derbyshire, the son of the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843–1923), vicar of Montacute, Somerset, for 32 years, and Mary Cowper Johnson, grand-daughter of Dr John Johnson, cousin and close friend of the poet William Cowper. He was one of eleven talented siblings, including the novelist John Cowper Powys (1872–1963) and the novelist and essayist Llewelyn Powys (1884–1939). Their sister Philippa Powys also published a novel and some poetry, while Marian Powys was an authority on lace and lace-making and published a book on this subject. Gertrude Powys was a painter. Another brother, A. R. Powys, was secretary of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and published a number of books on architectural subjects.

A sensitive child, Powys was not happy in school and left when he was 15 to become an apprentice on a farm in Suffolk. Later he had his own farm in Suffolk, but he was not successful and returned to Dorset in 1901 with plans to be a writer. Then, in 1905, he married Violet Dodd. They had two sons and later adopted a daughter. From 1904 until 1940 Theodore Powys lived in East Chaldon but then moved to Mappowder because of the Second World War.

During the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), Powys was one of several UK writers who campaigned for aid to be sent to the Republican side.

The novels &quot;Mr. Weston&#x27;s Good Wine&quot; (1927) and &quot;Unclay&quot; (1931) and the short-story collection &quot;Fables&quot; are most praised, while his early non-fiction work &quot;The Soliloquy of a Hermit&quot; (1916) also has its admirers. Powys was deeply, if unconventionally, religious; the Bible was a major influence, and he had a special affinity with writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, including John Bunyan, Miguel de Cervantes, Jeremy Taylor, Jonathan Swift, and Henry Fielding. Among more recent writers, he admired Thomas Hardy, Sigmund Freud, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Powys has been described by C. N. Manlove as one of the three main writers – along with C. S. Lewis and Charles Williams – of &quot;Christian fantasy&quot; in the 20th century.

He died on 27 November 1953 in Mappowder, Dorset, where he was buried.

<text>Llewelyn Powys (13 August 1884 – 2 December 1939) was a British essayist, novelist and younger brother of John Cowper Powys and T. F. Powys.

==Family==
Powys was born in Dorchester, the son of the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843–1923), who was vicar of Montacute, Somerset for thirty-two years, and Mary Cowper Johnson, a granddaughter of Dr John Johnson, the cousin and friend of the poet William Cowper.

He came from a family of eleven children, many of whom were also talented. Two brothers John Cowper Powys and Theodore Francis Powys were also well-known writers, while his sister Philippa published a novel and some poetry. Another sister Marian Powys was an authority on lace and lace-making and published a book on this subject. His brother A. R. Powys was Secretary of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and published a number of books on architectural subjects.

==Life==
He was educated at Sherborne School (1899–1903) and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (1903–1906). While lecturing in the United States he contracted tuberculosis. After his return in 1909, he travelled again, living for a while in Switzerland. He spent time in Africa, farming with his brother William near Gilgil in British East Africa (now in Kenya) from 1914 to 1919.
In 1920 he went again to America to work as a journalist. While living in New York City he met and married, in 1924, the novelist Alyse Gregory (1884–1967), editor of the journal &quot;The Dial&quot;. In 1925 the couple moved to Dorset: firstly to the Coastguard Cottages on White Nothe and then to nearby farmhouse Chydyok, where his two sisters, the poet and novelist, Philippa Powys, and the artist, Gertrude Powys, occupied the adjacent cottage. This was close to the village of East Chaldon where his brother, the author Theodore Powys, lived from 1904 until 1940. Various other writers and artists lived in the village at different times, such as Sylvia Townsend Warner and David Garnett, the poets Valentine Ackland and Gamel Woolsey, and the sculptors Elizabeth Muntz and Stephen Tomlin.

Gamel Woolsey met John Cowper Powys when she lived in Patchin Place, Greenwich Village, and, through him, his brother Llewelyn and his wife, Alyse Gregory. She and Alyse became friends for life, while with Llewelyn she had a passionate and painful love affair. Woolsey left New York for England in 1929, settling in Dorset to be near Llewelyn, where she came to know the whole Powys family and their circle. Parting from Llewelyn in 1930, she married the historian and writer Gerald Brenan in a private ceremony, and they lived together, mainly in Spain, until her death.

Powys traveled with his wife, paying visits to Mandatory Palestine (1928), the West Indies (1930) and Switzerland (1937). He died in Clavadel, Switzerland from complications related to an ulcer.

His writings include a novel, &quot;Apples Be Ripe&quot; (1930), and a biography of Henry Hudson (1927). He was very friendly with Hamilton Rivers Pollock, Barrister, owner from 1928, of Urchfont Manor.

==Rationalism==
Powys identified as a rationalist and wrote articles critical of religion in freethought journals such as the &quot;Rationalist Annual&quot; and &quot;The Literary Guide&quot;.

He was an atheist.

<doc id="216137" wikidata="Q6309857" url="?curid=216137" title="Julius Hoffman">
<text>Julius Jennings Hoffman (July 7, 1895 – July 1, 1983) was an American attorney and jurist who served as a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. He presided over the Chicago Seven trial.

==Early life and education==
Hoffman was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Bertha (Weisberg) and Aaron Hoffman. His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants. Hoffman attended the Lewis Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) and then received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree from Northwestern University at the age of sixteen in 1912. He received a Bachelor of Laws from Northwestern University School of Law in 1915.

== Career ==
Hoffman worked in the private practice of law in Chicago with the law firm of White and Hawxhurst from 1915 to 1936 and with the law firm of Markheim, Hoffman, Hungerford &amp; Sollo from 1944 to 1947. He was general counsel for the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company from 1936 to 1944. He was a Judge of the Superior Court of Cook County, Illinois from 1947 to 1953.

===Federal judicial service===

Hoffman was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on April 27, 1953, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, to a new seat created by 64 Stat. 443. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 13, 1953, and received commission the next day. He assumed senior status on February 3, 1972. He served until his death on July 1, 1983, in Chicago.

====Notable cases====

Over the course of his career as a judge, Hoffman presided over numerous important cases, including a tax evasion case against Tony Accardo, an obscenity case against Lenny Bruce, a deportation suit against alleged Nazi war criminal Frank Walus, and several desegregation suits. Both the obscenity conviction and the conviction of Frank Walus were overturned, with the courts citing Hoffman’s overzealous nature as the reason in both cases. 

====Chicago Seven====

Hoffman&#x27;s most notable case was the trial from April 9, 1969, to February 20, 1970, that involved charges against protesters arrested during the 1968 Democratic Convention, originally known as the &quot;Chicago Eight&quot;. During the course of the Chicago Eight trial, Hoffman refused to allow the defendant Bobby Seale to represent himself after Seale&#x27;s original attorney became ill. This prompted conflicts with Seale that led to Hoffman ordering Seale to be gagged and shackled in the courtroom and eventually jailed for contempt. Finally, Hoffman removed Seale from the trial, leaving the case with only seven defendants, at which point the trial became known as the &quot;Chicago Seven&quot; trial. Because of this, and his non-objective attitude, Hoffman became the favorite courtroom target of the Chicago Seven defendants, who often openly insulted the judge. Abbie Hoffman (no direct relation) told Judge Hoffman &quot;you are a &quot;shande far dee Goyim&quot;&quot; [&quot;a disgrace (to the Jewish community) in front of the Gentiles&quot; in Yiddish] and that &quot;[y]ou would have served Hitler better.&quot; He later added that &quot;your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room.&quot; Both Rennie Davis and Jerry Rubin told the judge, &quot;This court is bullshit.&quot;

All seven were found by a jury to be not guilty of conspiracy, but five of the defendants were found guilty of inciting a riot, and Hoffman sentenced each of the five to the maximum penalty: five years in prison and a fine of $5,000, plus court costs. In addition, Hoffman sentenced all eight defendants and both of their lawyers (William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass) to lengthy jail terms for contempt of court.

On May 11, 1972, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated all of the contempt convictions, and on November 21, 1972, reversed all of the substantive convictions on a number of grounds. Among other things, the appeals court found that Hoffman had not sufficiently measured the biases of the jury and that he had exhibited a &quot;deprecatory and often antagonistic attitude toward the defense.&quot;

==Later life==

In 1974, author Joseph Goulden wrote a book called &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot;, which was an exposé of the powerful and often private world of federal judges. Goulden conducted an in-depth investigation of Hoffman and pointed out that he had an abrasive reputation among Chicago lawyers even before his most famous case. Goulden mentioned a survey that had been done among Chicago attorneys who had recently appeared before the judge and 78% had an unfavorable opinion of him. They responded overwhelmingly negatively to the questions, &quot;Does he display an impartial attitude?&quot; and &quot;Is he courteous to both the prosecution and defense?&quot;

In 1982, the Executive Committee of the United States District Court ordered that Hoffman not be assigned any new cases because of his age and complaints that he was acting erratically and abusively from the bench. However, he continued to preside over his ongoing cases until his death from natural causes the next year, a week before his 88th birthday.

<doc id="216140" wikidata="Q11236878" url="?curid=216140" title="Lacquer">
<text>Lacquer is a type of hard and usually shiny coating or finish applied to materials such as wood or metal. It is most often made from resin extracted from trees and waxes and has been in use since antiquity.

Asian lacquerware, which may be called &quot;true lacquer&quot;, are objects coated with the treated, dyed and dried sap of &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&quot; or related trees, applied in several coats to a base that is usually wood. This dries to a very hard and smooth surface layer which is durable, waterproof, and attractive in feel and look. Asian lacquer is sometimes painted with pictures, inlaid with shell and other materials, or carved, as well as dusted with gold and given other further decorative treatments.

In modern techniques, lacquer means a range of clear or pigmented coatings that dry by solvent evaporation to produce a hard, durable finish. The finish can be of any sheen level from ultra to high gloss, and it can be further polished as required. Lacquer finishes are usually harder and more brittle than oil-based or latex paints and are typically used on hard and smooth surfaces.

In terms of modern finishing products, finishes based on shellac dissolved in alcohol are often called &quot;shellac&quot; or &quot;lac&quot; to distinguish them from synthetic lacquer, often called simply &quot;lacquer&quot;, which consists of synthetic polymers (such as nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate butyrate (&quot;CAB&quot;), or acrylic resin) dissolved in &quot;lacquer thinner&quot;, a mixture of various organic solvents. Although synthetic lacquer is more durable than shellac, traditional shellac finishes are nevertheless often preferred for their aesthetic characteristics, as with French polish, as well as their &quot;all-natural&quot; and generally food-safe ingredients.

==Etymology==
The English is from the archaic French word , &quot;a kind of sealing wax&quot;, from Portuguese , itself an unexplained variant of Medieval Latin &quot;resinous substance,&quot; from Arabic (), from Persian (), from Hindi (); Prakrit , ), itself from the Sanskrit word  () for lac bug, representing the number one hundred thousand (100,000), used as wood finish in ancient India and neighbouring areas.
==Sheen measurement==
Lacquer sheen is a measurement of the shine for a given lacquer. Different manufacturers have their own names and standards for their sheen. The most common names from least shiny to most shiny are: flat, matte, eggshell, satin, semi-gloss, and gloss (high).

==Shellac-based lacquers==

In India shellac derived from insect lac was used since ancient times. Shellac is the secretion of the lac bug (&quot;Tachardia lacca&quot; Kerr. or &quot;Laccifer lacca&quot;). It is used for wood finish, lacquerware, skin cosmetic, ornaments, dye for textiles, production of different grades of shellac for surface coating.

==Urushiol-based lacquers==

Urushiol-based lacquers differ from most others, being slow-drying, and set by oxidation and polymerization, rather than by evaporation alone. The active ingredient of the resin is urushiol, a mixture of various phenols suspended in water, plus a few proteins. In order for it to set properly it requires a humid and warm environment. The phenols oxidize and polymerize under the action of laccase enzymes, yielding a substrate that, upon proper evaporation of its water content, is hard. These lacquers produce very hard, durable finishes that are both beautiful and very resistant to damage by water, acid, alkali or abrasion. The resin is derived from trees indigenous to East Asia, like lacquer tree &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&quot;, and wax tree &quot;Toxicodendron succedaneum&quot;. The fresh resin from the &quot;T. vernicifluum&quot; trees causes urushiol-induced contact dermatitis and great care is therefore required in its use. The Chinese treated the allergic reaction with crushed shellfish, which supposedly prevents lacquer from drying properly. Lacquer skills became very highly developed in Asia, and many highly decorated pieces were produced.

It has been confirmed that the lacquer tree has existed in Japan since nearly 12,600 years ago in the incipient Jōmon period. This was confirmed by radioactive carbon dating of the lacquer tree found at the Torihama shell mound and is the oldest lacquer tree in the world found as of 2011. Lacquer was used in Japan as early as 7000 BCE, during the Jōmon period. Evidence for the earliest lacquerware was discovered at the Kakinoshima &quot;B&quot; Excavation Site in Hokkaido. The ornaments woven with lacquered red thread were discovered in a pit grave dating from the first half of the Initial Jōmon period. Also, at Kakinoshima &quot;A&quot; Excavation Site, earthenware with a spout painted with vermilion lacquer, which was made 3200 years ago, was found almost completely intact.

During the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC), the sophisticated techniques used in the lacquer process were first developed and it became a highly artistic craft, although various prehistoric lacquerwares have been unearthed in China dating back to the Neolithic period. The earliest extant Chinese lacquer object, a red wooden bowl, was unearthed at a Hemudu culture (5000–4500 BC) site in China. By the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), many centres of lacquer production became firmly established. The knowledge of the Chinese methods of the lacquer process spread from China during the Han, Tang and Song dynasties. Eventually it was introduced to Korea and Japan.

Trade of lacquer objects travelled through various routes to the Middle East. Known applications of lacquer in China included coffins, music instruments, furniture, and various household items. Lacquer mixed with powdered cinnabar is used to produce the traditional red lacquerware from China.
From the 16th century to the 17th century, lacquer was introduced to Europe on a large scale for the first time through trade with Japanese. Until the 19th century, lacquerware was one of Japan&#x27;s major exports, and European royalty, aristocrats and religious people represented by Marie-Antoinette, Maria Theresa and The Society of Jesus collected Japanese lacquerware luxuriously decorated with maki-e. The terms related to lacquer such as &quot;Japanning&quot;, &quot;Urushiol&quot; and &quot;maque&quot; which means lacquer in Mexican Spanish, are derived from Japanese.

The trees must be at least ten years old before cutting to bleed the resin. It sets by a process called &quot;aqua-polymerization&quot;, absorbing oxygen to set; placing in a humid environment allows it to absorb more oxygen from the evaporation of the water.

Lacquer-yielding trees in Thailand, Vietnam, Burma and Taiwan, called Thitsi, are slightly different; they do not contain urushiol, but similar substances called laccol or thitsiol. The result is similar but softer than the Chinese or Japanese lacquer. Burmese lacquer sets slower, and is painted by craftsmen&#x27;s hands without using brushes.

Raw lacquer can be &quot;coloured&quot; by the addition of small amounts of iron oxides, giving red or black depending on the oxide. There is some evidence that its use is even older than 8,000 years from archaeological digs in Japan and China. Later, pigments were added to make colours. It is used not only as a finish, because if mixed with ground fired and unfired clays applied to a mould with layers of hemp cloth, it can produce objects without need for another core like wood. The process is called &quot;kanshitsu&quot; in Japan. In the lacquering of the Chinese musical instrument, the guqin, the lacquer is mixed with deer horn powder (or ceramic powder) to give it more strength so it can stand up to the fingering.

There are a number of forms of urushiol. They vary by the length of the R chain, which depends on the species of plant producing the urushiol. Urushiol can also vary in the degree of saturation in the carbon chain. Urushiol can be drawn as follows:
, where:

R = (CH2)14CH3 orR = (CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)5CH3 orR = (CH2)7CH=CHCH2CH=CH(CH2)2CH3 orR = (CH2)7CH=CHCH2CH=CHCH=CHCH3 orR = (CH2)7CH=CHCH2CH=CHCH2CH=CH2

===Types of lacquer===

Types of lacquer vary from place to place but they can be divided into unprocessed and processed categories.

The basic unprocessed lacquer is called &quot;raw lacquer&quot; (生漆: &quot;ki-urushi&quot; in Japanese, &quot;shengqi&quot; in Chinese). This is directly from the tree itself with some impurities filtered out. Raw lacquer has a water content of around 25% and appears in a light brown colour. This comes in a standard grade made from Chinese lacquer, which is generally used for ground layers by mixing with a powder, and a high-quality grade made from Japanese lacquer called &quot;kijomi-urushi&quot; (生正味漆) which is used for the last finishing layers.

The processed form (in which the lacquer is stirred continuously until much of the water content has evaporated) is called &quot;guangqi&quot; (光漆) in Chinese but comes under many different Japanese names depending on the variation, for example, &quot;kijiro-urushi&quot; (木地呂漆) is standard transparent lacquer sometimes used with pigments and &quot;kuroroiro-urushi&quot; (黒呂色漆) is the same but pre-mixed with iron hydroxide to produce a black coloured lacquer. &quot;Nashiji-urushi&quot; (梨子地漆) is the transparent lacquer but mixed with gamboge to create a yellow-tinged lacquer and is especially used for the sprinkled-gold technique. These lacquers are generally used for the middle layers. Japanese lacquers of this type are generally used for the top layers and are prefixed by the word &quot;jo-&quot; (上) which means &#x27;top (layer)&#x27;.

Processed lacquers can have oil added to them to make them glossy, for example, &quot;shuai-urushi&quot; (朱合漆) is mixed with linseed oil. Other specialist lacquers include &quot;ikkake-urushi&quot; (釦漆) which is thick and used mainly for applying gold or silver leaf.

==Nitrocellulose lacquers==
Solvent-based dipping lacquers that contain nitrocellulose, a resin obtained from the nitration of cotton and other cellulosic materials, debuted in the 19th century along with nitrocellulose&#x27;s other commercial applications. They were used, for example, on brass items such as musical instruments. Faster-drying and more durable versions of these lacquers were developed in the early 1920s, when the end of the WWI caused a massive overcapacity of nitrocellulose production, and soon greatly displaced much use of the slower-drying paints and lacquers that preceded them; they were extensively used in the automotive industry and others for the next 30 years until further chemical advancements replaced them. Prior to their introduction, mass-produced automotive finishes were limited in colour, damaged easily, and took a long time to dry, with Japan black being the fastest drying and thus the most economical to use.

The problem with using nitrocellulose in lacquers was its high viscosity, which necessitated dilution of the product with large amounts of thinner for application, leaving only a very thin film of finish not durable enough for outdoor use. This problem was overcome by decreasing the viscosity of the polymer (the term actually post-dates the empirical solution, with Staudinger&#x27;s modern structural theory explaining polymer solution viscosity by length of molecular chains not yet experimentally proven in 1920s) with heat treatments, either with 2% of mineral acid or in an autoclave at considerable pressure.

The first practical nitrocellulose enamel Glossy White S.2567, still for interior use, was introduced in 1919 in the UK by Nobel Explosives. In 1923, General Motors&#x27; Oakland brand automobile was the first to introduce one of the new fast-drying nitrocellulose lacquers, a bright blue, produced by DuPont under their Duco tradename. In 1924 the other GM makes followed suit, and by 1925 nitrocellulose lacquers were thoroughly disrupting the traditional paint business for automobiles, appliances, furniture, musical instruments, caskets, and other products. Henry Ford and, in the UK, Herbert Austin were introducing nitrocellulose lacquers at the same time, and soon the market flourished.

Nitrocellulose lacquers are also used to make firework fuses waterproof. The nitrocellulose and other resins and plasticizers are dissolved in the solvent, and each coat of lacquer dissolves some of the previous coat. These lacquers were a huge improvement over earlier automobile and furniture finishes, both in ease of application and in colour retention. The preferred method of applying quick-drying lacquers is by spraying, and the development of nitrocellulose lacquers led to the first extensive use of spray guns. Nitrocellulose lacquers produce a hard yet flexible, durable finish that can be polished to a high sheen. Drawbacks of these lacquers include the hazardous nature of the solvent, which is flammable and toxic, and the hazards of nitrocellulose in the manufacturing process. The lacquer grade of soluble nitrocellulose is closely related to the more highly nitrated form which is used to make explosives. They become relatively non-toxic after approximately a month since, at this point, the lacquer has evaporated most of the solvents used in its production.

==Acrylic lacquers==
Lacquers using acrylic resin, a synthetic polymer, were developed in the 1950s. Acrylic resin is colourless, transparent thermoplastic, obtained by the polymerization of derivatives of acrylic acid. Acrylic is also used in enamel paints, which have the advantage of not needing to be buffed to obtain a shine. Enamels, however, are slow drying. The advantage of acrylic lacquer is its exceptionally fast drying time. The use of lacquers in automobile finishes was discontinued when tougher, more durable, weather- and chemical-resistant two-component polyurethane coatings were developed. The system usually consists of a primer, colour coat and clear topcoat, commonly known as clear coat finishes.

==Water-based lacquers==
Due to health risks and environmental considerations involved in the use of solvent-based lacquers, much work has gone into the development of water-based lacquers. Such lacquers are considerably less toxic, more environmentally friendly, and, in many cases, produce acceptable results. While water-based lacquer&#x27;s fumes are considerably less hazardous, and it does not have the combustibility issues of solvent-based lacquers, the product still dries fairly quickly. Even though its odor is weaker, water-based lacquers can still produce airborne particulates that can get into the lungs, so proper protective wear still needs to be worn. More and more water-based colored lacquers are replacing solvent-based clear and colored lacquers in under-hood and interior applications in the automobile and other similar industrial applications. Water-based lacquers are used extensively in wood furniture finishing as well.

One drawback of water-based lacquer is that it has a tendency to be highly reactive to other fresh finishes such as quick-dry primer (excluding waterborne lacquer primers), caulking and even some paints that have a paint/primer aspect. Tannin bleed-through can also be an issue, depending on the brand of lacquer used. Once it happens, there is no easy fix as the lacquer is so reactive to other products.

Water-based lacquer used for wood finishing is also not rated for exterior wear, unless otherwise specified.

==Japanning==

Just as &quot;china&quot; is a common name for porcelain, &quot;japanning&quot; is an old name to describe the European technique to imitate Asian lacquerware. As Asian lacquer work became popular in England, France, the Netherlands, and Spain in the 17th century, the Europeans developed imitation techniques. The European technique, which is used on furniture and other objects, uses finishes that have a resin base similar to shellac. The technique, which became known as japanning, involves applying several coats of varnish which are each heat-dried and polished. In the 18th century, japanning gained a large popular following. Although traditionally a pottery and wood coating, japanning was the popular (mostly black) coating of the accelerating metalware industry. By the twentieth century, the term was freely applied to coatings based on various varnishes and lacquers besides the traditional shellac.

<text>Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways meeting society&#x27;s present food and textile needs, without compromising the ability for current or future generations to meet their needs. It can be based on an understanding of ecosystem services. There are many methods to increase the sustainability of agriculture. When developing agriculture within sustainable food systems, it is important to develop flexible business processes and farming practices. Agriculture has an enormous environmental footprint, playing a significant role in causing climate change (food systems are responsible for one third of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions), water scarcity, water pollution, land degradation, deforestation and other processes; it is simultaneously causing environmental changes and being impacted by these changes. Sustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without causing damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects on soil, water, biodiversity, and surrounding or downstream resources, as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. Elements of sustainable agriculture can include permaculture, agroforestry, mixed farming, multiple cropping, and crop rotation.

Developing sustainable food systems contributes to the sustainability of the human population. For example, one of the best ways to mitigate climate change is to create sustainable food systems based on sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture provides a potential solution to enable agricultural systems to feed a growing population within the changing environmental conditions. Besides sustainable farming practices, dietary shifts to sustainable diets are an intertwined way to substantially reduce environmental impacts. Numerous sustainability standards and certification systems exist, including organic certification, Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade, UTZ Certified, GlobalGAP, Bird Friendly, and the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C).

== Definition ==
The term &quot;sustainable agriculture&quot; was defined in 1977 by the USDA as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will, over the long term: 
* satisfy human food and fiber needs
* enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agriculture economy depends
* make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and on-farm resources and integrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles and controls
* sustain the economic viability of farm operations
* enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.
Yet the idea of having a sustainable relationship with the land has been prevalent in indigenous communities for centuries before the term was formally added to the lexicon.

== Aims ==
A common consensus is that sustainable farming is the most realistic way to feed growing populations. In order to successfully feed the population of the planet, farming practices must consider future costs–to both the environment and the communities they fuel. The risk of not being able to provide enough resources for everyone led to the adoption of technology within the sustainability field to increase farm productivity. The ideal end result of this advancement is the ability to feed ever-growing populations across the world. The growing popularity of sustainable agriculture is connected to the wide-reaching fear that the planet&#x27;s carrying capacity (or planetary boundaries), in terms of the ability to feed humanity, has been reached or even exceeded.

=== Key principles ===
There are several key principles associated with sustainability in agriculture:

# The incorporation of biological and ecological processes such as nutrient cycling, soil regeneration, and nitrogen fixation into agricultural and food production practices.
# Using decreased amounts of non-renewable and unsustainable inputs, particularly environmentally harmful ones.
# Using the expertise of farmers to both productively work the land as well as to promote the self-reliance and self-sufficiency of farmers.
# Solving agricultural and natural resource problems through the cooperation and collaboration of people with different skills. The problems tackled include pest management and irrigation.

It &quot;considers long-term as well as short-term economics because sustainability is readily defined as forever, that is, agricultural environments that are designed to promote endless regeneration&quot;. It balances the need for resource conservation with the needs of farmers pursuing their livelihood.

It is considered to be reconciliation ecology, accommodating biodiversity within human landscapes.

Oftentimes, the execution of sustainable practices within farming comes through the adoption of technology and environmentally-focused appropriate technology.

== Technological approaches ==
Sustainable agricultural systems are becoming an increasingly important field for AI research and development. By leveraging AI&#x27;s skills in areas such as resource optimization, crop health monitoring, and yield prediction, farmers might greatly advance toward more environmentally friendly agricultural practices. Artificial intelligence (AI) mobile soil analysis enables farmers to enhance soil fertility while decreasing their ecological footprint. This technology permits on-site, real-time evaluations of soil nutrient levels. 

== Environmental factors ==
Practices that can cause long-term damage to soil include excessive tilling of the soil (leading to erosion) and irrigation without adequate drainage (leading to salinization).

The most important factors for a farming site are climate, soil, nutrients and water resources. Of the four, water and soil conservation are the most amenable to human intervention. When farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, the land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced yields. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as natural gas or mineral ores.

A farm that can &quot;produce perpetually&quot;, yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is the application of fertilizer or manure, which can improve the productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters (eutrophication). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to rainforest destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about which include land for animal fodder, cereal production as a cash crop, and other food crops. In some cases, a small unit of aquaculture is included (AARI-1996).

===Nutrients===
====Nitrates====
Nitrates are used widely in farming as fertilizer. Unfortunately, a major environmental problem associated with agriculture is the leaching of nitrates into the environment. Possible sources of nitrates that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:

#recycling crop waste and livestock or treated human manure
#growing legume crops and forages such as peanuts or alfalfa that form symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia
#industrial production of nitrogen by the Haber process uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by electrolysis of water using renewable electricity)
#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.

The last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible. Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.

Other options include long-term crop rotations, returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients) such as the flooding of the Nile, the long-term use of biochar, and use of crop and livestock landraces that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients. Crops that require high levels of soil nutrients can be cultivated in a more sustainable manner with appropriate fertilizer management practices.

==== Phosphate ====
Phosphate is a primary component in fertilizer. It is the second most important nutrient for plants after nitrogen, and is often a limiting factor. It is important for sustainable agriculture as it can improve soil fertility and crop yields. Phosphorus is involved in all major metabolic processes including photosynthesis, energy transfer, signal transduction, macromolecular biosynthesis, and respiration. It is needed for root ramification and strength and seed formation, and can increase disease resistance.

Phosphorus is found in the soil in both inorganic and organic forms and makes up approximately 0.05% of soil biomass. Phosphorus fertilizers are the main input of inorganic phosphorus in agricultural soils and approximately 70%–80% of phosphorus in cultivated soils is inorganic. Long-term use of phosphate-containing chemical fertilizers causes eutrophication and deplete soil microbial life, so people have looked to other sources.
Phosphorus fertilizers are manufactured from rock phosphate. However, rock phosphate is a non-renewable resource and it is being depleted by mining for agricultural use: peak phosphorus will occur within the next few hundred years, or perhaps earlier.

==== Potassium ====
Potassium is a macronutrient very important for plant development and is commonly sought in fertilizers. This nutrient is essential for agriculture because it improves water retention, nutrient value, yield, taste, color, texture and disease resistance of crops. It is often used in the cultivation of grains, fruits, vegetables, rice, wheat, millets, sugar, corn, soybeans, palm oil and coffee.

Potassium chloride (KCl) represents the most widely source of K used in agriculture, accounting for 90% of all potassium produced for agricultural use.  

The use of KCl leads to high concentrations of chloride (Clˉ) in soil harming its health due to the increase in soil salinity, imbalance in nutrient availability and this ion&#x27;s biocidal effect for soil organisms. In consequences the development of plants and soil organisms is affected, putting at risk soil biodiversity and agricultural productivity. A sustainable option for replacing KCl are chloride-free fertilizers, its use should take into account plants&#x27; nutrition needs, and the promotion of soil health.

=== Soil ===
Land degradation is becoming a severe global problem. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: &quot;About a quarter of the Earth&#x27;s ice-free land area is subject to human-induced degradation (medium confidence). Soil erosion from agricultural fields is estimated to be currently 10 to 20 times (no tillage) to more than 100 times (conventional tillage) higher than the soil formation rate (medium confidence).&quot; Almost half of the land on earth is covered with dry land, which is susceptible to degradation. Over a billion tonnes of southern Africa&#x27;s soil are being lost to erosion annually, which if continued will result in halving of crop yields within thirty to fifty years. Improper soil management is threatening the ability to grow sufficient food. Intensive agriculture reduces the carbon level in soil, impairing soil structure, crop growth and ecosystem functioning, and accelerating climate change. Modification of agricultural practices is a recognized method of carbon sequestration as soil can act as an effective carbon sink.

Soil management techniques include no-till farming, keyline design and windbreaks to reduce wind erosion, reincorporation of organic matter into the soil, reducing soil salinization, and preventing water run-off.

=== Land ===
As the global population increases and demand for food increases, there is pressure on land as a resource. In land-use planning and management, considering the impacts of land-use changes on factors such as soil erosion can support long-term agricultural sustainability, as shown by a study of Wadi Ziqlab, a dry area in the Middle East where farmers graze livestock and grow olives, vegetables, and grains.

Looking back over the 20th century shows that for people in poverty, following environmentally sound land practices has not always been a viable option due to many complex and challenging life circumstances. Currently, increased land degradation in developing countries may be connected with rural poverty among smallholder farmers when forced into unsustainable agricultural practices out of necessity.

Converting big parts of the land surface to agriculture has severe environmental and health consequences. For example, it leads to rise in zoonotic disease (like the Coronavirus disease 2019) due to the degradation of natural buffers between humans and animals, reducing biodiversity and creating larger groups of genetically similar animals.

Land is a finite resource on Earth. Although expansion of agricultural land can decrease biodiversity and contribute to deforestation, the picture is complex; for instance, a study examining the introduction of sheep by Norse settlers (Vikings) to the Faroe Islands of the North Atlantic concluded that, over time, the fine partitioning of land plots contributed more to soil erosion and degradation than grazing itself.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion.

=== Energy ===
In modern agriculture, energy is used in on-farm mechanisation, food processing, storage, and transportation processes. It has therefore been found that energy prices are closely linked to food prices. Oil is also used as an input in agricultural chemicals. The International Energy Agency projects higher prices of non-renewable energy resources as a result of fossil fuel resources being depleted. It may therefore decrease global food security unless action is taken to &#x27;decouple&#x27; fossil fuel energy from food production, with a move towards &#x27;energy-smart&#x27; agricultural systems including renewable energy.
The use of solar powered irrigation in Pakistan is said to be a closed system for agricultural water irrigation.

The environmental cost of transportation could be avoided if people use local products.

=== Water ===

In some areas sufficient rainfall is available for crop growth, but many other areas require irrigation. For irrigation systems to be sustainable, they require proper management (to avoid salinization) and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise, the water source effectively becomes a non-renewable resource. Improvements in water well drilling technology and submersible pumps, combined with the development of drip irrigation and low-pressure pivots, have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the Ogallala Aquifer, the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.

According to the UC Davis Agricultural Sustainability Institute, several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in &quot;normal&quot; years with average rainfall. These measures include both policy and management actions:

# improving water conservation and storage measures
# providing incentives for selection of drought-tolerant crop species
# using reduced-volume irrigation systems
# managing crops to reduce water loss
# not planting crops at all.
Indicators for sustainable water resource development include the average annual flow of rivers from rainfall, flows from outside a country, the percentage of water coming from outside a country, and gross water withdrawal. It is estimated that agricultural practices consume 69% of the world&#x27;s fresh water. 

Farmers discovered a way to save water using wool in Wyoming and other parts of the United States.

==Social factors==
=== Rural economic development ===
Sustainable agriculture attempts to solve multiple problems with one broad solution. The goal of sustainable agricultural practices is to decrease environmental degradation due to farming while increasing crop–and thus food–output. There are many varying strategies attempting to use sustainable farming practices in order to increase rural economic development within small-scale farming communities. Two of the most popular and opposing strategies within the modern discourse are allowing unrestricted markets to determine food production and deeming food a human right. Neither of these approaches have been proven to work without fail. A promising proposal to rural poverty reduction within agricultural communities is sustainable economic growth; the most important aspect of this policy is to regularly include the poorest farmers in the economy-wide development through the stabilization of small-scale agricultural economies.

In 2007, the United Nations reported on &quot;Organic Agriculture and Food Security in Africa&quot;, stating that using sustainable agriculture could be a tool in reaching global food security without expanding land usage and reducing environmental impacts. There has been evidence provided by developing nations from the early 2000s stating that when people in their communities are not factored into the agricultural process that serious harm is done. The social scientist Charles Kellogg has stated that, &quot;In a final effort, exploited people pass their suffering to the land.&quot; Sustainable agriculture mean the ability to permanently and continuously &quot;feed its constituent populations&quot;.

There are a lot of opportunities that can increase farmers&#x27; profits, improve communities, and continue sustainable practices. For example, in Uganda, Genetically Modified Organisms were originally illegal. However, with the stress of banana crisis in Uganda, where Banana Bacterial Wilt had the potential to wipe out 90% of yield, they decided to explore GMOs as a possible solution. The government issued the National Biotechnology and Biosafety bill, which will allow scientists that are part of the National Banana Research Program to start experimenting with genetically modified organisms. This effort has the potential to help local communities because a significant portion live off the food they grow themselves, and it will be profitable because the yield of their main produce will remain stable.

Not all regions are suitable for agriculture. The technological advancement of the past few decades has allowed agriculture to develop in some of these regions. For example, Nepal has built greenhouses to deal with its high altitude and mountainous regions. Greenhouses allow for greater crop production and also use less water since they are closed systems.

Desalination techniques can turn salt water into fresh water which allows greater access to water for areas with a limited supply. This allows the irrigation of crops without decreasing natural fresh water sources. While desalination can be a tool to provide water to areas that need it to sustain agriculture, it requires money and resources. Regions of China have been considering large scale desalination in order to increase access to water, but the current cost of the desalination process makes it impractical.

=== Women ===
Women working in sustainable agriculture come from numerous backgrounds, ranging from academia to labour. From 1978-2007, in the United States, the number of women farm operators has tripled. In 2007, women operated 14 percent of farms, compared to five percent in 1978. Much of the growth is due to women farming outside of the &quot;male dominated field of conventional agriculture&quot;.

=== Growing your own food ===
The practice of growing food in the backyard of houses, schools, etc., by families or by communities became widespread in the US at the time of World War I, the Great Depression and World War II, so that in one point of time 40% of the vegetables of the USA was produced in this way. The practice became more popular again in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. This method permits to grow food in a relatively sustainable way and at the same time can make it easier for poor people to obtain food.

== Economic factors ==
Costs, such as environmental problems, not covered in traditional accounting systems (which take into account only the direct costs of production incurred by the farmer) are known as externalities.

Netting studied sustainability and intensive agriculture in smallholder systems through history.

There are several studies incorporating externalities such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, land degradation, and sustainable land management in economic analysis. These include The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity study and the Economics of Land Degradation Initiative which seek to establish an economic cost-benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management and sustainable agriculture.

Triple bottom line frameworks include social and environmental alongside a financial bottom line. A sustainable future can be feasible if growth in material consumption and population is slowed down and if there is a drastic increase in the efficiency of material and energy use. To make that transition, long- and short-term goals will need to be balanced enhancing equity and quality of life.

== Challenges and debates ==

=== Barriers ===
The barriers to sustainable agriculture can be broken down and understood through three different dimensions. These three dimensions are seen as the core pillars to sustainability: social, environmental, and economic pillars. The social pillar addresses issues related to the conditions in which societies are born into, growing in, and learning from. It deals with shifting away from traditional practices of agricultural and moving into new sustainable practices that will create better societies and conditions. The environmental pillar addresses climate change and focuses on agricultural practices that protect the environment for future generations. The economic pillar discovers ways in which sustainable agriculture can be practiced while fostering economic growth and stability, with minimal disruptions to livelihoods. All three pillars must be addressed to determine and overcome the barriers preventing sustainable agricultural practices. 

Social barriers to sustainable agriculture include cultural shifts, the need for collaboration, incentives, and new legislation. The move from conventional to sustainable agriculture will require significant behavioural changes from both farmers and consumers. Cooperation and collaboration between farmers is necessary to successfully transition to sustainable practices with minimal complications. This can be seen as a challenge for farmers who care about competition and profitability. There must also be an incentive for farmers to change their methods of agriculture. The use of public policy, advertisements, and laws that make sustainable agriculture mandatory or desirable can be utilized to overcome these social barriers.

Environmental barriers prevent the ability to protect and conserve the natural ecosystem. Examples of these barriers include the use of pesticides and the effects of climate change. Pesticides are widely used to combat pests that can devastate production and plays a significant role in keeping food prices and production costs low. To move toward sustainable agriculture, farmers are encouraged to utilize green pesticides, which cause less harm to both human health and habitats, but would entail a higher production cost. Climate change is also a rapidly growing barrier, one that farmers have little control over, which can be seen through place-based barriers. These place-based barriers include factors such as weather conditions, topography, and soil quality which can cause losses in production, resulting in the reluctance to switch from conventional practices. Many environmental benefits are also not visible or immediately evident. Significant changes such as lower rates of soil and nutrient loss, improved soil structure, and higher levels of beneficial microorganisms take time. In conventional agriculture, the benefits are easily visible with no weeds, pests, etc..., but the long term costs to the soil and surrounding ecosystems are hidden and &quot;externalized&quot;. Conventional agricultural practices since the evolution of technology have caused significant damage to the environment through biodiversity loss, disrupted ecosystems, poor water quality, among other harms.

The economic obstacles to implementing sustainable agricultural practices include low financial return/profitability, lack of financial incentives, and negligible capital investments. Financial incentives and circumstances play a large role in whether sustainable practices will be adopted. The human and material capital required to shift to sustainable methods of agriculture requires training of the workforce and making investments in new technology and products, which comes at a high cost. In addition to this, farmers practicing conventional agriculture can mass produce their crops, and therefore maximize their profitability. This would be difficult to do in sustainable agriculture which encourages low production capacity.

The author James Howard Kunstler claims almost all modern technology is bad and that there cannot be sustainability unless agriculture is done in ancient traditional ways. Efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community, however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end. One promising method of encouraging sustainable agriculture is through local farming and community gardens. Incorporating local produce and agricultural education into schools, communities, and institutions can promote the consumption of freshly grown produce which will drive consumer demand.

Some foresee a true sustainable steady state economy that may be very different from today&#x27;s: greatly reduced energy usage, minimal ecological footprint, fewer consumer packaged goods, local purchasing with short food supply chains, little processed foods, more home and community gardens, etc.

===Different viewpoints about the definition===
There is a debate on the definition of sustainability regarding agriculture. The definition could be characterized by two different approaches: an ecocentric approach and a technocentric approach. The ecocentric approach emphasizes no- or low-growth levels of human development, and focuses on organic and biodynamic farming techniques with the goal of changing consumption patterns, and resource allocation and usage. The technocentric approach argues that sustainability can be attained through a variety of strategies, from the view that state-led modification of the industrial system like conservation-oriented farming systems should be implemented, to the argument that biotechnology is the best way to meet the increasing demand for food.

One can look at the topic of sustainable agriculture through two different lenses: multifunctional agriculture and ecosystem services. Both of these approaches are similar, but look at the function of agriculture differently. Those that employ the multifunctional agriculture philosophy focus on farm-centered approaches, and define function as being the outputs of agricultural activity. The central argument of multifunctionality is that agriculture is a multifunctional enterprise with other functions aside from the production of food and fiber. These functions include renewable resource management, landscape conservation and biodiversity. The ecosystem service-centered approach posits that individuals and society as a whole receive benefits from ecosystems, which are called &quot;ecosystem services&quot;. In sustainable agriculture, the services that ecosystems provide include pollination, soil formation, and nutrient cycling, all of which are necessary functions for the production of food.

It is also claimed sustainable agriculture is best considered as an ecosystem approach to agriculture, called agroecology.

=== Ethics ===
Most agricultural professionals agree that there is a &quot;moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.&quot; The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population.

==Methods==
Other practices include polyculture, growing a diverse number of perennial crops in a single field, each of which would grow in separate seasons so as not to compete with each other for natural resources. This system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in the soil. Nitrogen fixation from legumes, for example, used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from the soil for growth, helps to allow the land to be reused annually. Legumes will grow for a season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate, and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest.

Sustainable methods of weed management may help reduce the development of herbicide-resistant weeds. Crop rotation may also replenish nitrogen if legumes are used in the rotations and may also use resources more efficiently.

There are also many ways to practice sustainable animal husbandry. Some of the tools to grazing management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called paddocks, lowering stock density, and moving the stock between paddocks frequently.

===Intensification===
An increased production is a goal of intensification. Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 163 million farms used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide. In light of concerns about food security, human population growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high crop yields, while maintaining soil health and ecosystem services. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that – in relation to pest management at least – promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.

Vertical farming is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.

===Water===
Water efficiency can be improved by reducing the need for irrigation and using alternative methods. Such methods include: researching on drought resistant crops, monitoring plant transpiration and reducing soil evaporation.

Drought resistant crops have been researched extensively as a means to overcome the issue of water shortage. They are modified genetically so they can adapt in an environment with little water. This is beneficial as it reduces the need for irrigation and helps conserve water. Although they have been extensively researched, significant results have not been achieved as most of the successful species will have no overall impact on water conservation. However, some grains like rice, for example, have been successfully genetically modified to be drought resistant.

===Soil and nutrients===
Soil amendments include using compost from recycling centers. Using compost from yard and kitchen waste uses available resources in the area.

Abstinence from soil tillage before planting and leaving the plant residue after harvesting reduces soil water evaporation; It also serves to prevent soil erosion.

Crop residues left covering the surface of the soil may result in reduced evaporation of water, a lower surface soil temperature, and reduction of wind effects.

A way to make rock phosphate more effective is to add microbial inoculates such as phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms, known as PSMs, to the soil. These solubilize phosphorus already in the soil and use processes like organic acid production and ion exchange reactions to make that phosphorus available for plants. Experimentally, these PSMs have been shown to increase crop growth in terms of shoot height, dry biomass and grain yield.

Phosphorus uptake is even more efficient with the presence of mycorrhizae in the soil. Mycorrhiza is a type of mutualistic symbiotic association between plants and fungi, which are well-equipped to absorb nutrients, including phosphorus, in soil. These fungi can increase nutrient uptake in soil where phosphorus has been fixed by aluminum, calcium, and iron. Mycorrhizae can also release organic acids that solubilize otherwise unavailable phosphorus.

===Pests and weeds===

Soil steaming can be used as an alternative to chemicals for soil sterilization. Different methods are available to induce steam into the soil to kill pests and increase soil health.

Solarizing is based on the same principle, used to increase the temperature of the soil to kill pathogens and pests.

Certain plants can be cropped for use as &quot;biofumigants&quot;, &quot;natural&quot; fumigants, releasing pest suppressing compounds when crushed, ploughed into the soil, and covered in plastic for four weeks. Plants in the Brassicaceae family release large amounts of toxic compounds such as methyl isothiocyanates.

===Location===
Relocating current croplands to environmentally more optimal locations, whilst allowing ecosystems in then-abandoned areas to regenerate could substantially decrease the current carbon, biodiversity, and irrigation water footprint of global crop production, with relocation only within national borders also having substantial potential.

===Plants===
Sustainability may also involve crop rotation. Crop rotation and cover crops prevent soil erosion, by protecting topsoil from wind and water. Effective crop rotation can reduce pest pressure on crops, provides weed control, reduces disease build up, and improves the efficiency of soil nutrients and nutrient cycling. This reduces the need for fertilizers and pesticides. Increasing the diversity of crops by introducing new genetic resources can increase yields by 10 to 15 percent compared to when they are grown in monoculture. Perennial crops reduce the need for tillage and thus help mitigate soil erosion, and may sometimes tolerate drought better, increase water quality and help increase soil organic matter. There are research programs attempting to develop perennial substitutes for existing annual crops, such as replacing wheat with the wild grass &quot;Thinopyrum intermedium&quot;, or possible experimental hybrids of it and wheat. Being able to do all of this without the use of chemicals is one of the main goals of sustainability which is why crop rotation is a very central method of sustainable agriculture.

=== Organic agriculture ===

Organic agriculture can be defined as:
Some claim organic agriculture may produce the most sustainable products available for consumers in the US, where no other alternatives exist, although the focus of the organics industry is not sustainability.

In 2018 the sales of organic products in USA reach $52.5 billion. According to a USDA survey, two-thirds of Americans consume organic products at least occasionally.

=== Ecological farming ===
Ecological farming is a concept that focused on the environmental aspects of sustainable agriculture. Ecological farming includes all methods, including organic, which regenerate ecosystem services like: prevention of soil erosion, water infiltration and retention, carbon sequestration in the form of humus, and increased biodiversity. Many techniques are used including no-till farming, multispecies cover crops, strip cropping, terrace cultivation, shelter belts, pasture cropping etc.

There are a plethora of methods and techniques that are employed when practicing ecological farming, all having their own unique benefits and implementations that lead to more sustainable agriculture. Crop genetic diversity is one method that is used to reduce the risks associated with monoculture crops, which can be susceptible to a changing climate. This form of biodiversity causes crops to be more resilient, increasing food security and enhancing the productivity of the field on a long-term scale. The use of biodigestors is another method which converts organic waste into a combustible gas, which can provide several benefits to an ecological farm: it can be used as a fuel source, fertilizer for crops and fish ponds, and serves as a method for removing wastes that are rich in organic matter. Because biodigestors can be used as fertilizer, it reduces the amount of industrial fertilizers that are needed to sustain the yields of the farm. Another technique used is aquaculture integration, which combines fish farming with agricultural farming, using the wastes from animals and crops and diverting them towards the fish farms to be used up instead of being leeched into the environment. Mud from the fish ponds can also be used to fertilize crops.

Organic fertilizers can also be employed in an ecological farm, such as animal and green manure. This allows soil fertility to be improved and well-maintained, leads to reduced costs and increased yields, reduces the usage of non-renewable resources in industrial fertilizers (Nitrogen and Phosphorus), and reduces the environmental pressures that are posed by intensive agricultural systems. Precision Agriculture can also be used, which focuses on efficient removal of pests using non-chemical techniques and minimizes the amount of tilling needed to sustain the farm. An example of a precision machine is the false seedbed tiller, which can remove a great majority of small weeds while only tilling one centimeter deep. This minimized tilling reduces the amount of new weeds that germinate from soil disturbance. Other methods that reduce soil erosion include contour farming, strip cropping, and terrace cultivation.

==== Benefits ====
* Ecological farming involves the introduction of symbiotic species, where possible, to support the ecological sustainability of the farm. Associated benefits include a reduction in ecological debt and elimination of dead zones.
* Ecological farming is a pioneering, practical development which aims to create globally sustainable land management systems, and encourages review of the importance of maintaining biodiversity in food production and farming end products.
* One foreseeable option is to develop specialized automata to scan and respond to soil and plant situations relative to intensive care for the soil and the plants. Accordingly, conversion to ecological farming may best utilize the information age, and become recognised as a primary user of robotics and expert systems.

==== Challenges ====
The challenge for ecological farming science is to be able to achieve a mainstream productive food system that is sustainable or even regenerative. To enter the field of ecological farming, location relative to the consumer, can reduce the food miles factor to help minimise damage to the biosphere by combustion engine emissions involved in current food transportation.

Design of the ecological farm is initially constrained by the same limitations as conventional farming: local climate, the soil&#x27;s physical properties, budget for beneficial soil supplements, manpower and available automatons; however long-term water management by ecological farming methods is likely to conserve and increase water availability for the location, and require far fewer inputs to maintain fertility.

==== Principles ====
Certain principles unique to ecological farming need to be considered.
*Food production should be ecological in both &quot;origin&quot; and &quot;destiny&quot; (the term &quot;destiny&quot; refers to the post-harvest ecological footprint which results in getting produce to the consumer).
*Integration of species that maintain ecosystem services whilst providing a selection of alternative products.
*Minimise food miles, packaging, energy consumption and waste.
*Define a new ecosystem to suit human needs using lessons from existing ecosystems from around the world.
*Apply the value of a knowledge-base (advanced data base) about soil microorganisms so that discoveries of the ecological benefits of having various kinds of microorganisms encouraged in productive systems such as Forest Gardens can be assessed and optimised; for example in the case of naturally occurring microorganisms called denitrifiers.

=== Traditional agriculture ===

Often thought of as inherently destructive, slash-and-burn or slash-and-char shifting cultivation have been practiced in the Amazon for thousands of years.

Some traditional systems combine polyculture with sustainability. In South-East Asia, rice-fish systems on rice paddies have raised freshwater fish as well as rice, producing an additional product and reducing eutrophication of neighboring rivers. A variant in Indonesia combines rice, fish, ducks and water fern; the ducks eat the weeds that would otherwise limit rice growth, saving labour and herbicides, while the duck and fish manure substitute for fertilizer.

Raised field agriculture has been recently revived in certain areas of the world, such as the Altiplano region in Bolivia and Peru. This has resurged in the form of traditional Waru Waru raised fields, which create nutrient-rich soil in regions where such soil is scarce. This method is extremely productive and has recently been utilized by indigenous groups in the area and the nearby Amazon Basin to make use of lands that have been historically hard to cultivate.

Other forms of traditional agriculture include agro forestry, crop rotations, and water harvesting. Water harvesting is one of the largest and most common practices, particularly used in dry areas and seasons. In Ethiopia, over half of their GDP and over 80 percent of their exports are attributed to agriculture; yet, it is known for its intense droughts and dry periods. Rain water harvesting is considered to be a low-cost alternative. This type of harvesting collects and stores water from roof tops during high-rain periods for use during droughts. Rainwater harvesting has been a large practice to help the country survive by focusing on runoff irrigation, roof water harvesting, and flood spreading.

==== Indigenous Agriculture in North America ====

Native Americans in the United States practiced sustainable agriculture through their subsistence farming techniques. Many tribes grew or harvested their own food from plants that thrived in their local ecosystems. Native American farming practices are specific to local environments and work with natural processes. This is a practice called Permaculture, and it involves a deep understanding of the local environment. Native American farming techniques also incorporate local biodiversity into many of their practices, which helps the land remain healthy.

Many indigenous tribes incorporated Intercropping into their agriculture, which is a practice where multiple crops are planted together in the same area. This strategy allows crops to help one another grow through exchanged nutrients, maintained soil moisture, and physical supports for one another. The crops that are paired in intercropping often do not heavily compete for resources, which helps them to each be successful. For example, many tribes utilized intercropping in ways such as the Three Sisters Garden. This gardening technique consists of corn, beans, and squash. These crops grow in unity as the corn stalk supports the beans, the beans produce nitrogen, and the squash retain moisture. Intercropping also provides a natural strategy for pest management and the prevention of weed growth. Intercropping is a natural agricultural practice that often improves the overall health of the soil and plants, increases crop yield, and is sustainable.

One of the most significant aspects of indigenous sustainable agriculture is their traditional ecological knowledge of harvesting. The Anishinaabe tribes follow an ideology known as &quot;the Honorable Harvest&quot;. The Honorable Harvest is a set of practices that emphasize the idea that people should &quot;take only what you need and use everything you take.&quot; Resources are conserved through this practice because several rules are followed when harvesting a plant. These rules are to never take the first plant, never take more than half of the plants, and never take the last plant. This encourages future growth of the plant and therefore leads to a sustainable use of the plants in the area.

Native Americans practiced agroforestry by managing the forest, animals, and crops together. They also helped promote tree growth through controlled burns and silviculture. Often, the remaining ash from these burns would be used to fertilize their crops. By improving the conditions of the forest, the local wildlife populations also increased. Native Americans allowed their livestock to graze in the forest, which provided natural fertilizer for the trees as well.

=== Regenerative agriculture ===

Regenerative agriculture is a conservation and rehabilitation approach to food and farming systems. It focuses on topsoil regeneration, increasing biodiversity, improving the water cycle, enhancing ecosystem services, supporting biosequestration, increasing resilience to climate change, and strengthening the health and vitality of farm soil. Practices include, recycling as much farm waste as possible, and adding composted material from sources outside the farm.

=== Alternative methods ===
==== Permaculture ====
==== Polyculture ====

There is limited evidence polyculture may contribute to sustainable agriculture. A meta-analysis of a number of polycrop studies found that predator insect biodiversity was higher at comparable yields than conventional in certain two-crop systems with a single cash crop combined with a cover crop.

One approach to sustainability is to develop polyculture systems using perennial crop varieties. Such varieties are being developed for rice, wheat, sorghum, barley, and sunflowers. If these can be combined in polyculture with a leguminous cover crop such as alfalfa, fixation of nitrogen will be added to the system, reducing the need for fertilizer and pesticides.

==== Local small-scale agriculture ====
The use of available city space (e.g., rooftop gardens, community gardens, garden sharing, organopónicos, and other forms of urban agriculture) may be able to contribute to sustainability. Some consider &quot;guerrilla gardening&quot; an example of sustainability in action – in some cases seeds of edible plants have been sown in local rural areas.

==== Hydroponics or soil-less culture ====
Hydroponics is an alternative to agriculture that creates the ideal environment for optimal growth without using a dormant medium. This innovative farming technique produces higher crop yields without compromising soil health. The most significant drawback of this sustainable farming technique is the cost associated with development.

==Standards ==

Certification systems are important to the agriculture community and to consumers as these standards determine the sustainability of produce. Numerous sustainability standards and certification systems exist, including organic certification, Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade, UTZ Certified, GlobalGAP, Bird Friendly, and the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C). These standards specify rules that producers, manufacturers and traders need to follow so that the things they do, make, or grow do not hurt people and the environment. These standards are also known as Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS) that are private standards that require products to meet specific economic, social or environmental sustainability metrics. The requirements can refer to product quality or attributes, but also to production and processing methods, as well as transportation. VSS are mostly designed and marketed by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or private firms and they are adopted by actors up and down the value chain, from farmers to retailers. Certifications and labels are used to signal the successful implementation of a VSS. According to the ITC standards map the mostly covered products by standards are agricultural products. Around 500 VSS today apply to key exports of many developing countries, such as coffee, tea, bananas, cocoa, palm oil, timber, cotton, and organic agri-foods. VSS are found to reduce eutrophication, water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and natural ecosystem conversion. And thus are considered as a potential tool for sustainable agriculture.

The USDA produces an organic label that is supported by nationalized standards of farmers and facilities. The steps for certification consist of creating an organic system plan, which determines how produce will be tilled, grazed, harvested, stored, and transported. This plan also manages and monitors the substances used around the produce, the maintenance needed to protect the produce, and any nonorganic products that may come in contact with the produce. The organic system plan is then reviewed and inspected by the USDA certifying agent. Once the certification is granted, the produce receives an approval sticker from the USDA and the produce is distributed across the U.S. In order to hold farmers accountable and ensure that Americans are receiving organic produce, these inspections are done at least once a year. This is just one example of sustainable certification systems through produce maintenance.

== Policy ==
Sustainable agriculture is a topic in international policy concerning its potential to reduce environmental risks. In 2011, the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change, as part of its recommendations for policymakers on achieving food security in the face of climate change, urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy. The Commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields, necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience. It also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade, including in national research and development budgets, land rehabilitation, economic incentives, and infrastructure improvement.

=== At the global level ===
During 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, 45 countries pledged to give more than 4 billion dollars for transition to sustainable agriculture. The organization &quot;Slow Food&quot; expressed concern about the effectivity of the spendings, as they concentrate on technological solutions and reforestation en place of &quot;a holistic agroecology that transforms food from a mass-produced commodity into part of a sustainable system that works within natural boundaries.&quot;

Additionally, the Summit consisted of negotiations that led to heavily reducing CO2 emissions, becoming carbon neutral, ending deforestation and reliance on coal, and limiting methane emissions.

In November, the Climate Action Tracker reported that global efforts are on track to for a 2.7 °C temperature increase with current policies, finding that the current targets will not meet global needs as coal and natural gas consumption are primarily responsible for the gap in progress. Since, like-minded developing countries asked for an addendum to the agreement that removed the obligation for developing countries to meet the same requirements of wealthy nations.

=== European Union ===

In May 2020 the European Union published a program, named &quot;From Farm to Fork&quot; for making its agriculture more sustainable. In the official page of the program From Farm to Fork is cited Frans Timmermans the Executive Vice-President of the European Commission, saying that:

The program includes the next targets:
* Making 25% of EU agriculture organic, by 2030.
* Reduce by 50% the use of pesticides by 2030.
* Reduce the use of fertilizers by 20% by 2030.
* Reduce nutrient loss by at least 50%.
* Reduce the use of antimicrobials in agriculture and antimicrobials in aquaculture by 50% by 2030.
* Create sustainable food labeling.
* Reduce food waste by 50% by 2030.
* Dedicate to R&amp;I related to the issue €10 billion.

=== United States ===
Policies from 1930 - 2000

The New Deal implemented policies and programs that promoted sustainable agriculture. Under the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1933, it provided farmers payments to create a supply management regime that capped production of important crops. This allowed farmers to focus on growing food and not competing in the market based system. The New Deal also provided a monetary incentive for farmers that left some of their fields unsown or ungrazed to order to improve the soil conditions. The Cooperative Extension Service was also established that set up sharing funding responsibilities amongst the USDA, land-grant universities, and local communities.

The 1950s to 1990s was when the government switched its stance on agriculture policy which halted sustainable agriculture. The Agricultural Act of 1954 passed which supported farmers with flexible price supports, but only to commodity programs. The Food and Agricultural Act of 1965 had new income support payments and continued supply controls but reduced priced supports. Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 removed price supports and instead introduced target prices and deficiency payments. It continued to promote commodity crops by lowering interest rates. Food Security Act of 1985 continued commodity loan programs. These policies incentivized profit over sustainability because the US government was promoting farms to maximize their production output instead of placing checks. This meant that farms were being turned into food factories as they became bigger in size and grew more commodity crops like corn, wheat, and cotton. From 1900 to 2002, the number of farms in the US decreased significantly while the average size of a farm went up after 1950.

Current Policies

In the United States, the federal Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA) provides technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation along with production agriculture. With programs like SARE and China-UK SAIN to help promote research on sustainable agriculture practices and a framework for agriculture and climate change respectively.

Future Policies

Currently, there are policies on the table that could move the US agriculture system into a more sustainable direction with the Green New Deal. This policy promotes decentralizing agrarian governance by breaking up large commodity farms that were created in the 1950s to 1980s. Decentralized governance within the farming community would allow for more adaptive management at local levels to help focus on climate change mitigation, food security, and landscape-scale ecological stewardship. The Green New Deal would invest in public infrastructure to support farmers transition from industrial food regime and acquire agroecological skills. Just like in the New Deal, it would invest in cooperatives and commons to share and redistribute resources like land, food, equipment, research facilities, personnel, and training programs. All of these policies and programs would break down barriers that have prevented sustainable farmers and agriculture from taking place in the United States.

=== Asia ===

==== China ====
In 2016, the Chinese government adopted a plan to reduce China&#x27;s meat consumption by 50%, for achieving more sustainable and healthy food system.

In 2019, the National Basic Research Program or Program 973 funded research into Science and Technology Backyard (STB). STBs are hubs often created in rural areas with significant rates of small-scale farming that combine knowledge of traditional practices with new innovations and technology implementation. The purpose of this program was to invest in sustainable farming throughout the country and increase food production while achieving few negative environmental effects. The program was ultimately proven to be successful, and the study found that the merging of traditional practices and appropriate technology was instrumental in higher crop yields.

==== India ====
In collaboration with the Food and Land Use Coalition (FOLU), CEEW (council for energy, environment and water), has given an overview of the current state of sustainable agriculture practices and systems (SAPSs) in India. India is aiming to scale-up SAPs, through policymakers, administrators, philanthropists, and other which represent a vital alternative to conventional, input-intensive agriculture. In idea these efforts identify 16 SAPSsincluding agroforestry, crop rotation, rainwater harvesting, organic farming and natural farmingusing agroecology as an investigative lens. In a conclusive understanding it is realised that sustainable agriculture is far from mainstream in India. Further proposals for several measures for promoting SAPSs, including restructured government support and rigorous evidence generation for benefits and implementation of sustainable farming are ongoing progress in Indian Agriculture.

An example of initiatives in India towards exploring the world of sustainable farming has been set by the Sowgood foundation which is a nonprofit founded by educator Pragati Chaswal. It started by teaching primary school children about sustainable farming by helping them farm on small farm strips in suburban farmhouses and gardens. Today many government and private schools in Delhi, India have adopted the sowgood foundation curriculum for sustainable farming for their students.

=== Other countries ===

==== Israel ====
In 2012, the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture found itself at the height of the Israeli commitment to sustainable agriculture policy. A large factor of this policy was funding programs that made sustainable agriculture accessible to smaller Palestinian-Arab communities. The program was meant to create biodiversity, train farmers in sustainable agriculture methods, and hold regular meetings for agriculture stakeholders.

== History ==
In 1907, the American author Franklin H. King discussed in his book &quot;Farmers of Forty Centuries&quot; the advantages of sustainable agriculture and warned that such practices would be vital to farming in the future. The phrase &#x27;sustainable agriculture&#x27; was reportedly coined by the Australian agronomist Gordon McClymont. The term became popular in the late 1980s. There was an international symposium on sustainability in horticulture by the International Society of Horticultural Science at the International Horticultural Congress in Toronto in 2002. At the following conference at Seoul in 2006, the principles were discussed further.

This potential future inability to feed the world&#x27;s population has been a concern since the English political economist Thomas Malthus in the early 1800s, but has become increasingly important recently. Starting at the very end of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, this issue became widely discussed in the U.S. because of growing anxieties of a rapidly increasing global population. Agriculture has long been the biggest industry worldwide and requires significant land, water, and labor inputs. At the turn of the twenty-first century, experts questioned the industry&#x27;s ability to keep up with population growth. This debate led to concerns over global food insecurity and &quot;solving hunger&quot;.

<text>Conservation agriculture (CA) can be defined by a statement given by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as &quot;Conservation Agriculture (CA) is a farming system that can prevent losses of arable land while regenerating degraded lands.It promotes minimum soil disturbance (i.e. no-till farming), maintenance of a permanent soil cover, and diversification of plant species. It enhances biodiversity and natural biological processes above and below the ground surface, which contribute to increased water and nutrient use efficiency and to improved and sustained crop production.&quot;

Agriculture according to the New Standard Encyclopedia is &quot;one of the most important sectors in the economies of most nations&quot; (New Standard 1992). At the same time conservation is the use of resources in a manner that safely maintains a resource that can be used by humans. Conservation has become critical because the global population has increased over the years and more food needs to be produced every year (New Standard 1992). Sometimes referred to as &quot;agricultural environmental management&quot;, conservation agriculture may be sanctioned and funded through conservation programs promulgated through agricultural legislation, such as the U.S. Farm Bill.

== Key principles ==
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has determined that conservation agriculture (CA) has three key principles that producers (farmers) can proceed through in the process of CA. These three principles outline what conservationists and producers believe can be done to conserve what we use for a longer period of time.

The first key principle in CA is practicing minimum soil disturbance which is essential to maintaining minerals within the soil, stopping erosion, and preventing water loss from occurring within the soil. In the past agriculture has looked at soil tillage as a main process in the introduction of new crops to an area. It was believed that tilling the soil would increase fertility within the soil through mineralization that takes place in the soil. Today tillage is seen as destroying organic matter that can be found within the soil cover. Tilling of soil can cause severe erosion and crusting which leads to a decrease in soil fertility. No-till farming has caught on as a process that can save soil organic levels for a longer period and still allow the soil to be productive for longer periods (FAO 2007). Minimum soil disturbance also conserves soil micro and macro-organism habitats that are commonly destroyed in conventional ploughing practices.

When no-till practices are followed, the producer sees a reduction in production cost for a certain crop. The process of tilling increases time and labor for producing that crop. Tillage of the ground requires more money in order to fuel tractors or to provide feed for the animals pulling the plough. The producer sees a reduction in labor because he or she does not have to be in the fields as long as a conventional farmer.

The second key principle in CA is much like the first in dealing with protecting the soil. The principle of managing the top soil to create a permanent organic soil cover can allow for growth of organisms within the soil structure. This growth will break down the mulch that is left on the soil surface. The breaking down of this mulch will produce a high organic matter level which will act as a fertilizer for the soil surface. If CA practices were used done for many years and enough organic matter was being built up at the surface, then a layer of mulch would start to form. This layer helps prevent soil erosion from taking place and ruining the soil&#x27;s profile or layout. The presence of mulching also reduce the velocity of runoff and the impact of rain drops thus reducing soil erosion and runoff.

According to the article &quot;The role of conservation agriculture and sustainable agriculture&quot;, the layer of mulch that is built up over time will become like a buffer zone between soil and mulch and this will help reduce wind and water erosion. With this comes the protection of the soil&#x27;s surface when rain falls on the ground. Land that is not protected by a layer of mulch is left open to the elements (Hobbs et al. 2007). This type of ground cover also helps keep the temperature and moisture levels of the soil at a higher level rather than if it was tilled every year (FAO 2007).

The third principle is the practicing diverse crop rotations or crop interactions. According to an article published in the &quot;Physiological Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; called &quot;The role of conservation agriculture and sustainable agriculture&quot;, crop rotation can be used best as a disease control against other preferred crops (Hobbs et al. 2007). This process will not allow pests such as insects and weeds to be set into a rotation with specific crops. Rotational crops will act as a natural insecticide and herbicide against specific crops. Not allowing insects or weeds to establish a pattern will help to eliminate problems with yield reduction and infestations within fields (FAO 2007). Crop rotation can also help build up soil infrastructure. Establishing crops in a rotation allows for an extensive buildup of rooting zones which will allow for better water infiltration (Hobbs et al. 2007).

Organic molecules in the soil break down into phosphates, nitrates and other beneficial elements which are thus better absorbed by plants. Plowing increases the amount of oxygen in the soil and increases the aerobic processes, hastening the breakdown of organic material. Thus more nutrients are available for the next crop but, at the same time, the soil is depleted more quickly of its nutrient reserves.

== Examples ==
In conservation agriculture there are many examples that can be looked towards as a way of farming and at the same time conserving. These practices are well known by most producers. The process of no-till is one that follows the first principle of CA, causing minimal mechanical soil disturbance. No-till also brings other benefits to the producer. According to the FAO, tillage is one of the most &quot;energy consuming&quot; processes that can be used: It requires a lot of labor, time, and fuel to till. Producers can save 30% to 40% of time and labor by practicing the no-till process. (FAO 3020)

Besides conserving the soil, there are other examples of how CA is used. According to an article in &quot;Science&quot; called &quot;Farming and the Fate of Wild Nature&quot; there are two more kinds of CA. The practice of wildlife-friendly farming and land sparing are ideas for producers who are looking to practice better conservation towards biodiversity (Green, et al. 2005).

=== Wildlife-friendly farming ===
Wildlife-friendly farming, also known as land sharing, allows for the conservation of biodiversity while also allowing for production of agricultural products. In this approach, land is set aside to preserve the wildlife while the rest is used to fulfill the farmers need of agricultural commodities. Farmers take this approach by leaving some aspects of the land the same (i.e., scattered trees and patches of initial vegetation) while harvesting a diverse grouping of crops around it. This, in turn, allows for animals such as bees to pollinate, and the natural predation of unwanted pests. By practicing such method the harvester can expect to see much lower yields, but also an increase in biodiversity given time. This decrease of yield then gives rise to the idea of land sparing, the maximization of yield in a homogenous landscape.

=== Land sparing ===
Land sparing is another way that producer and conservationist can be on the same page. Land sparing advocates for the land that is being used for agricultural purposes to continue to produce crops at increased yield. With an increase in yield on all land that is in use, other land can be set aside for conservation and production for biodiversity. Agricultural land stays in production but would have to increase its yield potential to keep up with demand. Land that is not being put into agriculture would be used for conserving biodiversity (Green, et al. 2005). In fact, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization shows that between 1961 and 2012, the amount of arable land needed to produce the same amount of food declined by 68 percent worldwide.

== Benefits ==
In the field of CA there are many benefits that both the producer and conservationist can obtain.

On the side of the conservationist, CA can be seen as beneficial because there is an effort to conserve what people use every day. Since agriculture is one of the most destructive forces against biodiversity, CA can change the way humans produce food and energy. With conservation come environmental benefits of CA. These benefits include less erosion possibilities, better water conservation, improvement in air quality due to lower emissions being produced, and a chance for larger biodiversity in a given area.

On the side of the producer and/or farmer, CA can eventually do all that is done in conventional agriculture, and it can conserve better than conventional agriculture. CA according to Theodor Friedrich, who is a specialist in CA, believes &quot;Farmers like it because it gives them a means of conserving, improving, and making more efficient use of their natural resources&quot; (FAO 2006). Producers will find that the benefits of CA will come later rather than sooner. Since CA takes time to build up enough organic matter and have soils become their own fertilizer, the process does not start to work overnight. But if producers make it through the first few years of production, results will start to become more satisfactory.

CA is shown to have even higher yields and higher outputs than conventional agriculture once it has been established over long periods. Also, a producer has the benefit of knowing that the soil in which his crops are grown is a renewable resource. According to New Standard Encyclopedia, soils are a renewable resource, which means that whatever is taken out of the soil can be put back over time (New Standard 1992). As long as good soil upkeep is maintained, the soil will continue to renew itself. This could be very beneficial to a producer who is practicing CA and is looking to keep soils at a productive level for an extended time.

The farmer and/or producer can use this same land in another way when crops have been harvested. The introduction of grazing livestock to a field that once held crops can be beneficial for the producer and also the field itself. Livestock manure can be used as a natural fertilizer for a producer&#x27;s field which will then be beneficial for the producer the next year when crops are planted once again. The practice of grazing livestock using CA helps the farmer who raises crops on that field and the farmer who raises the livestock that graze off that field. Livestock produce compost or manure which are a great help in generating soil fertility (Pawley W.H. 1963). The practices of CA and grazing livestock on a field for many years can allow for better yields in the following years as long as these practices continue to be followed.
The FAO believes that there are three major benefits from CA: 
* Within fields that are controlled by CA the producer will see an increase in organic matter. 
* Increase in water conservation due to the layer of organic matter and ground cover to help eliminate transportation and access runoff. 
* Improvement of soil structure and rooting zone.

== Future development ==
As in any other business, producers and conservationists are always looking towards the future. In this case CA is a very important process to be looked at for future generation. There are many organizations that have been created to help educate and inform producers and conservationists in the world of CA. These organizations can help to inform, conduct research, and buy land in order to preserve animals and plants (New Standard 1992).

Another way in which CA is looking to the future is through prevention. According to the &quot;European Journal of Agronomy&quot; producers are looking for ways to reduce leaching problems within their fields. These producers are using the same principles within CA, in that they are leaving cover over their fields in order to save fields from erosion and leaching of chemicals (Kirchmann &amp; Thorvaldsson 2000). Processes and studies like this are allowing for a better understanding of how to conserve what we are using and finding ways to put back something that may have been lost before.

In the same journal article is presented another way in which producers and conservationists are looking towards the future. Circulation of plant nutrients can be a vital part for conserving the future. An example of this would be the use of animal manure. This process has been used for quite some time now, but the future is looking towards ways to handle and conserve nutrients within manure for a longer time. But besides animal waste, food and urban waste are also being looked towards as a way to use growth within CA (Kirchmann &amp; Thorvaldsson 2000). Turning these products from waste to being used to grow crops and improve yields is something that would be beneficial for conservationists and producers.

Agri-environment schemes

In 1992, &#x27;agri-environment schemes&#x27; became compulsory for all European Union Member States. In the following years the main purpose of these schemes changed slightly. 
Initially, they sought to protect threatened habitats, but gradually shifted their focus to the prevention of the loss of wildlife from agricultural landscapes. Most recently, the schemes are placing more emphasis on improving the services that the land can provide to humans (e.g. pollination). Overall, farmers involved in the scheme aim to practice environmentally friendlier farming techniques such as: reducing the use of pesticides, managing or altering their land to increase more wildlife friendly habitats (e.g. increasing areas of trees and bushes), reducing irrigation, conserving soil, and organic farming. 
As the changes in practices that ensure the protection of the environment are costly to farmers, the EU developed agri-environment schemes to financially compensate individual farmers for applying these changes and therefore increased the implementation of conservation agriculture. 
The schemes are voluntary for farmers. Once joined, they commit to a minimum of five years during which they have to adopt various sustainable farming techniques.
According to the Euro-stat website, in 2009 the agricultural area enrolled in agri-environment schemes covered 38.5 million hectares (20.9% of agricultural land in the 27 member states of the EU at the time) (Agri-environmental indicator 2015). The European Commission spent a total of €3.23 billion on agri-environment schemes in 2012, significantly exceeding the cost of managing special sites of conservation (Natura 2000) that year, which came to a total of €39.6 million (Batáry et al. 2015).

There are two main types of agri-environment schemes which have shown different outcomes. Out-of-production schemes tend to be used in extensive farming practices (where the farming land is widespread and less intensive farming is practiced), and focus on improving or setting land aside that will not be used for the production of food, for example, the addition of wildflower strips.
In-production schemes (used for a smaller scale, but more intensively farmed land) focus on the sustainable management of arable crops or grassland, for example reduction of pesticides, reduction of grassland mowing, and most commonly, organic farming. In a 2015 review of studies examining the effects of the two schemes, it was found that out-of-production schemes had a higher success rate at enhancing the number of thriving species around the land. 
The reason behind this is thought to be the scheme&#x27;s focus on enhancing specific species by providing them with more unaltered habitats, which results in more food resources for the specific species.
On the other hand, in-production schemes attempt to enhance the quality of the land in general, and are thus less species specific. 
Based on the findings, the reviewers suggest that schemes which more specifically target the declining groups of species, may be more effective. The findings and the targets will be implemented between 2015 and 2020, so that by 2025, the effectiveness of these schemes can be re-assessed and will have increased significantly (Batáry et al. 2015).

In this vein, in recent years &#x27;results based pilot programs&#x27; have been introduced across the EU under Pillar Two of the Common Agriculture Policy. Results-based agri-environmental programs are defined by the European Commission as &quot;schemes where farmers and land managers are paid for delivering an environmental result or outcome, e.g. number of breeding birds, or number of plant species in grasslands, with the flexibility to choose what management is required to achieve the desired result.&quot; Results-based payment programs are also commonly referred to as Pay for Performance or Payment for Ecosystem Services. These programs differ from traditional conservation programs by focusing on observed, verifiable outcomes as opposed to implementation of best practices. Pure results-based programs refer to programs that provide payments to farmers solely on the delivery of an environmental outcome. Hybrid results-based programs refer to programs that may have a management requirement component in addition to payments for observable environmental outcomes. Results based programs often increase farmer autonomy and participation, produce clear quantifiable results and effectively link payment to environmental conservation outcomes. Some NGOs have started to pilot similar programs in the US, for example Winrock International partnered with the Sand County Foundation to provide payment to farmers for reducing nutrient loads from their lands across the Midwest.

== Problems ==
As much as conservation agriculture can benefit the world, there are some problems that come with it. There are many reasons why conservation agriculture cannot always be a win-win situation. Examples of these disadvantages include high initial costs of specialized planting equipment, and a new dynamic farming system that requires new management skills and a learning process by the farmer. Long term experience with conservation farming all over the world has shown that this system does not present more or less but different problems to a farmer, all of them possible to resolve.

There are not enough people who can financially turn from conventional farming to conservation. The process of CA takes time; when a producer first becomes a conservationist, the results can be a financial loss to them (in most cases, the investment and policy generally exist). CA is based upon establishing an organic layer and producing its own fertilizer and this may take time. It can be many years before a producer will start to see better yields than he/she has had previously. Another financial undertaking is purchasing of new equipment. When starting to use CA, a producer may have to buy new planters or drills in order to produce effectively. These financial tasks are ones that may impact whether or not a producer decides to switch to CA or not.

Interactions with livestock and competition for crop residues - In developing countries, livestock is often an integral part of the farming system, so it needs to be considered when introducing CA. The application of CA requires a critical level of crop residues remaining on the surface, while traditionally most of these residues are used for feeding livestock. It is a common practice to allow livestock to graze in the harvested crop fields or to slash the crop residue and store it for fodder.

With the struggle to adapt comes the struggle to make CA grow across the globe. CA has not spread as quickly as most conservationists would like. The reason for this is because there is not enough pressure for producers in places such as North America to change their way of living to a more conservationist outlook. But in the tropics there is more pressure to change to conservation areas because of the limited resources that are available. Places like Europe have also started to catch onto the ideas and principles of CA, but still nothing much is being done to change due to there being a minimal amount of pressure for people to change their ways of living (FAO 2006).

With CA comes the idea of producing enough food. With cutting back in fertilizer, not tilling the ground, and other processes comes the responsibility to feed the world. According to the Population Reference Bureau, there were around 6.08 billion people on Earth in the year 2000. By 2050 there will be an estimated 9.1 billion people. With this increase comes the responsibility for producers to increase food supply using the same or less land than we use today. Problems arise in the fact that if CA farms do not produce as much as conventional farms, this leaves the world with less food for more people.

<text>Bulbophyllum is a genus of mostly epiphytic and lithophytic orchids in the family Orchidaceae. It is the largest genus in the orchid family and one of the largest genera of flowering plants with more than 2,000 species, exceeded in number only by &quot;Astragalus&quot;. These orchids are found in diverse habitats throughout most of the warmer parts of the world including Africa, southern Asia, Latin America, the West Indies, and various islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Orchids in this genus have thread-like or fibrous roots that creep over the surface of trees or rocks or hang from branches. The stem is divided into a rhizome and a pseudobulb, a feature that distinguished this genus from &quot;Dendrobium&quot;. There is usually only a single leaf at the top of the pseudobulb and from one to many flowers are arranged along an unbranched flowering stem that arises from the base of the pseudobulb. Several attempts have been made to separate &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; into smaller genera, but most have not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; are epiphytic or lithophytic sympodial herbs with thread-like or fibrous roots that creep over the surface on which they grow. The stem consists of a rhizome and a pseudobulb, the latter with one or two usually fleshy or leathery leaves. The flowers are arranged on an unbranched raceme that emerges from the pseudobulb, usually from its base. The sepal is free from the sepals which themselves may be free or fused to each other. The petals are also free from each other and smaller than the lateral sepals. The labellum is often fleshy, curved and hinged to the base of the column.

==Distribution and habitat==
The center of diversity of this genus is in the montane forests of Papua New Guinea (more than 600 species) which seems to be the evolutionary homeland, though the genus is pantropical and widespread, occurring in Australia, Southeast Asia (with over 200 species in Borneo), India, Madagascar (with 135 species, some endemic), Africa and in tropical central and South America.

The erect to pendent inflorescence arises laterally from the base of the pseudobulb. The flower form has a basic structural blueprint that serves to identify this genus. But this form can be very diverse : compound or single, with few to many flowers, with the resupinate flowers arranged spirally or in two vertical ranks. The sepals and the petals can also be very varied : straight or turned down, without footstalk or with a long claw at the base. They are often hairy or callous. There are two to four hard and waxy pollinia with stipes present or absent. The fruits are beakless capsules.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; was first formally described in 1822 by Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars in his book &quot;Histoire particulière des plantes orchidées recueillies sur les trois Iles Australes d&#x27;Afrique, de France, de Bourbon et de Madagascar&quot; in which he described eighteen species of &quot;Bulbophyllum.

There are now more than 2,800 records (accepted names and synonyms) for this genus. This large number and the great variety of its forms make the genus a considerable challenge for taxonomists: 120 sections and subgenera have been listed.

The genus name (&quot;Bulbophyllum&quot;) is derived from the Greek &quot;bolbos&quot; meaning &#x27;bulb&#x27; and &quot;phyllon&quot;, &#x27;a leaf&#x27;, referring to the pseudobulbs on top of which the leaf grows.

In 2014, Alec Pridgeon and others proposed merging the genus &quot;Drymoda&quot; with &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; in the &quot;Genera Orchidacearum&quot; and the change is accepted by Plants of the World Online and the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. The former species of &quot;Drymoda&quot; included &quot;D. digitata&quot; (now &quot;B. digitatum&quot;), &quot;D. gymnopus&quot; (now &quot;B. gymnopus&quot;), &quot;D. latisepala&quot; (now &quot;B. capillipes&quot;), &quot;D. picta&quot; (the type species of &quot;Drymoda&quot;, now &quot;B. drymoda&quot;), and &quot; D. siamensis&quot; (now &quot;B. ayuthayense&quot;).

===Evolution and biogeography===
Molecular phylogenetic studies place the origin of the orchid genus Bulbophyllum into the early Miocene. Biogeographic analyses and ancestral area reconstructions identified the Asia-Pacific region as the ancestral area of Bulbophyllum and suggest an early-to-late Miocene scenario of &#x27;out-of-Asia-Pacific&#x27; origin and progressive (east-to-west) dispersal-mediated diversification, resulting in three additional radiations in Madagascar, Africa and the Neotropics, respectively.

===Sections===

In 2019 Bulbophyllum were separated into four clades Neotropics, Africa, Madagascar, and the Asia-Pacific.

====Africa Clade====
====Madagascar Clade====
====Neotropical Clade====
====Asia-Pacific Clade====
==Ecology==

===Pollination===
Many &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; species have the typical odor of rotting carcasses, and the flies they attract assist in their reproduction through pollination. Nevertheless, some species with mild and pleasant floral fragrance attract Dacini fruit flies (particularly &quot;Bactrocera&quot; and &quot;Zeugodacus&quot; species) via methyl eugenol, raspberry ketone or zingerone that also act as floral reward during pollination.

To facilitate pollinarium removal and pollinia deposition, this group of orchids, particularly those that attract Dacini fruit flies, possesses a highly modified dynamic lip mechanism - either hinged or see-saw or spring lip (kept either in a close- or open-position depending on resupinate or non-resupinate flower, respectively). When an attracted fly has aligned itself to the opened lip, further probing, feeding and movement towards the lip base result in the lip to snap close, thereby, forcibly tipping the fly in to the column cavity to initiate pollinarium removal or pollinia deposition.

== Use in horticulture ==
&quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; (abbreviated Bulb. in the horticultural trade) includes species that have been the focus of orchid collectors for over a century. The plants require high humidity combined with good air movement and most of them are ever-blooming - flowering continuously throughout the year. They grow best at moderate light levels, but do not thrive in deep shade. They are considered moderate-to-difficult to cultivate, and require a controlled growing environment to achieve some degree of success. They are not typically suitable as houseplants, and most will not thrive in a Wardian case unless they receive adequate air movement.

The plants&#x27; growth habit produces widely spaced pseudobulbs along cord-like rhizome sections, and most of these plants are best accommodated on plaques. Some species in this genus can get very large, but most are small to medium-sized epiphytes from warm, moist, humid tropical forests. They can grow continuously year round with no apparent dormancy period if they are kept warm, are moderate feeders in cultivation, and must be kept moist all the time. They can tolerate dryness for short periods, but they have fine root systems which require moist conditions all the time.

Some of the smaller species do well in pots with small-diameter bark substrate. The plants produce very fine roots generally, and the roots are easily damaged. The plants react poorly to disturbance of their roots. They are easy to maintain once a good environment is established with high humidity and a fresh, buoyant, lightly circulating atmosphere being critical. Most of these species cannot tolerate cold temperatures or freezing.

The flowers produce various odors resembling sap, urine, blood, dung, carrion, and, in some species, fragrant fruity aromas. Most are fly-pollinated, and attract hordes of flies. &quot;Bulbophyllum beccarii&quot; in bloom has been likened to smelling like a herd of dead elephants and both this species and &quot;Bulbophyllum fletcherianum&quot; are variously described as making it difficult to walk into a greenhouse in which they are being cultivated if the plants are in bloom because of their overpowering floral odors.

=== Species ===

Some species are known for their extreme vegetative and floral forms:
*&quot;Bulbophyllum beccarii&quot;
*&quot;Bulbophyllum barbigerum&quot;
*&quot;Bulbophyllum falcatum&quot;
*&quot;Bulbophyllum santosii&quot;
*&quot;Bulbophyllum macphersonii&quot;
*&quot;Bulbophyllum medusae&quot;

== Conservation status ==

<text>Food quality is a concept often based on the organoleptic characteristics (e.g., taste, aroma, appearance) and nutritional value of food. Producers reducing potential pathogens and other hazards through food safety practices is another important factor in gauging standards. A food&#x27;s origin, and even its branding, can play a role in how consumers perceive the quality of products.

==Sensory==
Consumer acceptability of foods is typically based upon flavor and texture, as well as its color and smell.

==Safety==
The International Organization for Standardization identifies requirements for a producer&#x27;s food safety management system, including the processes and procedures a company must follow to control hazards and promote safe products, through ISO 22000. Federal and state level departments, specifically The Food and Drug Administration, are responsible for promoting public health by, among other things, ensuring food safety. Food quality in the United States is enforced by the Food Safety Act 1990. The European Food Safety Authority provides scientific advice and communicates on risks associated with the food chain on the continent.

There are many existing international quality institutes testing food products in order to indicate to all consumers which are higher quality products. Founded in 1961 in Brussels, The international Monde Selection quality award is the oldest in evaluating food quality. The judgements are based on the following areas: taste, health, convenience, labelling, packaging, environmental friendliness and innovation. As many consumers rely on manufacturing and processing standards, the Institute Monde Selection takes into account the European Food Law.

Food quality in the United States is enforced by the Food Safety Act 1990. Members of the public complain to trading standards professionals, [specify] who submit complaint samples and also samples used to routinely monitor the food marketplace to public analysts. Public analysts carry out scientific analysis on the samples to determine whether the quality is of sufficient standard. It is an important food manufacturing requirement because food consumers are susceptible to any form of contamination that may occur during the manufacturing process.

Food quality also deals with product traceability, (e.g., of ingredient, and packaging suppliers), should a recall of the product be required. It also deals with labeling issues to ensure there is correct ingredient and nutritional information. It is an important food manufacturing requirement, because food consumers are susceptible to any form of contamination that may occur during the manufacturing process. There are also sanitation requirements because it is important to ensure that the food processing environment is as clean as possible in order to produce the safest possible food for the consumer.

==Origin==
Environmentally sustainable practices, animal welfare, and authenticity play a subjective role when considering the quality of food.

Many consumers also rely on manufacturing and processing standards, particularly to know what ingredients are present, due to dietary, nutritional requirements (kosher, halal, vegetarian), or medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, or allergies).

== Food labeling ==
General food labeling is required by law to be present on food packages. Food containers and packages should be labeled on the front label panels or the principal display panel (PDP).

The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 covers the eight food groups that qualify as &quot;major food allergens&quot;: milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans.

The United States Department of Agriculture requires food labels to ensure the quality of food products sold. There are different types of food labeling guidelines depending on the type of food group, this includes: dairy, beef, poultry, eggs, USDA Certified Organic, Plant Variety Protection, fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops. Grade shields, official seals and labels are all granted to products that have completed review through USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service as well as following required labeling guidelines. To consumers and buyers, these shields, seals, and labels ensure the quality and integrity of products.

In Sweden, food labeling is regulated by the Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) and follows the guidelines set by the European Union. The EU&#x27;s primary regulation on food labeling is Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers.

<text>Pesticide resistance describes the decreased susceptibility of a pest population to a pesticide that was previously effective at controlling the pest. Pest species evolve pesticide resistance via natural selection: the most resistant specimens survive and pass on their acquired heritable changes traits to their offspring. If a pest has &quot;resistance&quot; then that will reduce the pesticide&#x27;s &quot;efficacy&quot; efficacy and resistance are inversely related.

Cases of resistance have been reported in all classes of pests (&quot;i.e.&quot; crop diseases, weeds, rodents, &quot;etc.&quot;), with &#x27;crises&#x27; in insect control occurring early-on after the introduction of pesticide use in the 20th century. The Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) definition of insecticide resistance is &quot;″a heritable change in the sensitivity of a pest population that is reflected in the repeated failure of a product to achieve the expected level of control when used according to the label recommendation for that pest species″&quot;.

Pesticide resistance is increasing. Farmers in the US lost 7% of their crops to pests in the 1940s; over the 1980s and 1990s, the loss was 13%, even though more pesticides were being used. Over 500 species of pests have evolved a resistance to a pesticide. Other sources estimate the number to be around 1,000 species since 1945.

Although the evolution of pesticide resistance is usually discussed as a result of pesticide use, it is important to keep in mind that pest populations can also adapt to non-chemical methods of control. For example, the northern corn rootworm (&quot;Diabrotica barberi&quot;) became adapted to a corn-soybean crop rotation by spending the year when the field is planted with soybeans in a diapause.

, few new weed killers are near commercialization, and none with a novel, resistance-free mode of action. Similarly, discovery of new insecticides is more expensive and difficult than ever.

==Causes==
Pesticide resistance probably stems from multiple factors:

* Many pest species produce large numbers of offspring, for example insect pests produce large broods. This increases the probability of mutations and ensures the rapid expansion of resistant populations.
* Pest species had been exposed to natural toxins long before agriculture began. For example, many plants produce phytotoxins to protect them from herbivores. As a result, coevolution of herbivores and their host plants required development of the physiological capability to detoxify or tolerate poisons. Secondary metabolites or allelochemicals produced by plants inhibit insect feeding, but insects have evolved enzymes to metabolize or detoxify them by converting them into non-toxic metabolites. The same enzymes may also detoxify insecticides by converting lipophic compounds into ones that are excreted or otherwise removed from the insect. Greater exposure to insect-inhibiting secondary metabolites or allelochemicals is more likely to increase pesticide resistance. One group of chemicals produced by insects to detoxify toxins are esterases which can detoxify organophosphates and pyrethroid. Conditions that affect how resistant some insects are to insecticides include exposure to different amounts of secondary metabolites or allelochemicals, which are variable among plant species in response to different degrees of herbivory pressure. The way an insect feeds on a plant impacts their exposure; insects that feed on the vascular tissue (sap sucking insects like aphids) are generally exposed to less insect-inhibiting compounds than insects that consume the leaves. Plants produce a wide range of defensive chemical compounds and generalist insects that feed on different types of plants can increase their exposure to them increasing their likelihood of developing pesticide resistance. 
* Humans often rely almost exclusively on pesticides for pest control. This increases selection pressure towards resistance. Pesticides that fail to break down quickly contribute to selection for resistant strains even after they are no longer being applied.
* In response to resistance, managers may increase pesticide quantities/frequency, which exacerbates the problem. In addition, some pesticides are toxic toward species that feed on or compete with pests. This can paradoxically allow the pest population to expand, requiring more pesticides. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;the pesticide trap&quot;, or a &quot;&quot;, since farmers progressively pay more for less benefit.
* Insect predators and parasites generally have smaller populations and are less likely to evolve resistance than are pesticides&#x27; primary targets, such as mosquitoes and those that feed on plants. Weakening them allows the pests to flourish. Alternatively, resistant predators can be bred in laboratories.
* Pests with limited viable range (such as insects with a specific diet of a few related crop plants) are more likely to evolve resistance, because they are exposed to higher pesticide concentrations and has less opportunity to breed with unexposed populations.
* Pests with shorter generation times develop resistance more quickly than others.
* The social dynamics of farmers: Farmers following the common practices of their peers is sometimes problematic in this case. Overrelying on pesticides is a popular mistake and becomes increasingly popular as farmers conform to the practices around them.
* Unfamiliarity with variation in regulatory enforcement can hamper policy makers&#x27; ability to produce real change in the course of resistance evolution.

==Examples==
Resistance has evolved in multiple species: resistance to insecticides was first documented by A. L. Melander in 1914 when scale insects demonstrated resistance to an inorganic insecticide. Between 1914 and 1946, 11 additional cases were recorded. The development of organic insecticides, such as DDT, gave hope that insecticide resistance was a dead issue. However, by 1947 housefly resistance to DDT had evolved. With the introduction of every new insecticide class – cyclodienes, carbamates, formamidines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, even &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; – cases of resistance surfaced within two to 20 years.

* Studies in America have shown that fruit flies that infest orange groves were becoming resistant to malathion.
* In Hawaii, Japan and Tennessee, the diamondback moth evolved a resistance to &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; about three years after it began to be used heavily.
* In England, rats in certain areas have evolved resistance that allows them to consume up to five times as much rat poison as normal rats without dying.
* DDT is no longer effective in preventing malaria in some places. Resistance developed slowly in the 1960s due to agricultural use. This pattern was especially noted and synthesized by Mouchet 1988.
* In the southern United States, &quot;Amaranthus palmeri&quot;, which interferes with cotton production, has evolved resistance to the herbicide glyphosate and overall has resistance to five sites of action in the southern US .
* The Colorado potato beetle has evolved resistance to 52 different compounds belonging to all major insecticide classes. Resistance levels vary across populations and between beetle life stages, but in some cases can be very high (up to 2,000-fold).
* The cabbage looper is an agricultural pest that is becoming increasingly problematic due to its increasing resistance to &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis,&quot; as demonstrated in Canadian greenhouses. Further research found a genetic component to Bt resistance.
* The widespread introduction of &quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot; (the brown rat) combined with the widespread use of anticoagulent rodenticides such as warfarin has produced almost equally widespread resistance to vitamin K antagonist rodenticides around the world.

==Consequences==
Insecticides are widely used across the world to increase agricultural productivity and quality in vegetables and grains (and to a lesser degree the use for vector control for livestock). The resulting resistance has reduced function for those very purposes, and in vector control for humans.

==Multiple and cross-resistance==
* Multiple-resistance pests are resistant to more than one class of pesticide. This can happen when pesticides are used in sequence, with a new class replacing one to which pests display resistance with another. 
* Cross-resistance, a related phenomenon, occurs when the genetic mutation that made the pest resistant to one pesticide also makes it resistant to others, often those with a similar mechanism of action.

==Adaptation==
Pests becomes resistant by evolving physiological changes that protect them from the chemical.

One protection mechanism is to increase the number of copies of a gene, allowing the organism to produce more of a protective enzyme that breaks the pesticide into less toxic chemicals. Such enzymes include esterases, glutathione transferases, aryldialkylphosphatase and mixed microsomal oxidases (oxidases expressed within microsomes).

Alternatively, the number and/or sensitivity of biochemical receptors that bind to the pesticide may be reduced.

Behavioral resistance has been described for some chemicals. For example, some &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitoes evolved a preference for resting outside that kept them away from pesticide sprayed on interior walls.

Resistance may involve rapid excretion of toxins, secretion of them within the body away from vulnerable tissues and decreased penetration through the body wall.

Mutation in only a single gene can lead to the evolution of a resistant organism. In other cases, multiple genes are involved. Resistant genes are usually autosomal. This means that they are located on autosomes (as opposed to allosomes, also known as sex chromosomes). As a result, resistance is inherited similarly in males and females. Also, resistance is usually inherited as an incompletely dominant trait. When a resistant individual mates with a susceptible individual, their progeny generally has a level of resistance intermediate between the parents.

Adaptation to pesticides comes with an evolutionary cost, usually decreasing relative fitness of organisms in the absence of pesticides. Resistant individuals often have reduced reproductive output, life expectancy, mobility, etc. Non-resistant individuals sometimes grow in frequency in the absence of pesticides - but not always - so this is one way that is being tried to combat resistance.

Blowfly maggots produce an enzyme that confers resistance to organochloride insecticides. Scientists have researched ways to use this enzyme to break down pesticides in the environment, which would detoxify them and prevent harmful environmental effects. A similar enzyme produced by soil bacteria that also breaks down organochlorides works faster and remains stable in a variety of conditions.

Resistance to gene drive forms of population control is expected to occur and methods of slowing its development are being studied.

The molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance only became comprehensible in 1997. Guerrero et al. 1997 used the newest methods of the time to find mutations producing pyrethroid resistance in dipterans. Even so, these adaptations to pesticides were unusually rapid and may not necessarily represent the norm in wild populations, under wild conditions. Natural adaptation processes take much longer and almost always happen in response to gentler pressures.

==Management==

In order to remediate the problem it first must be ascertained what is really wrong. Assaying of suspected pesticide resistance - and not merely field observation and experience - is necessary because it may be mistaken for failure to apply the pesticide as directed, or microbial degradation of the pesticide.

The United Nations&#x27; World Health Organization established the Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network in March 2016, due to increasing need and increasing recognition, including the radical decline in function against pests of vegetables.

===Integrated pest management===
The Integrated pest management (IPM) approach provides a balanced approach to minimizing resistance.

Resistance can be managed by reducing use of a pesticide: which may also be beneficial for mitigating pest resurgence. This allows non-resistant organisms to out-compete resistant strains. They can later be killed by returning to use of the pesticide.

A complementary approach is to site untreated refuges near treated croplands where susceptible pests can survive.

When pesticides are the sole or predominant method of pest control, resistance is commonly managed through pesticide rotation. This involves switching among pesticide classes with different modes of action to delay or mitigate pest resistance. The Resistance Action Committees monitor resistance across the world, and in order to do that, each maintains a list of modes of action and pesticides that fall into those categories: the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee, the Weed Science Society of America (the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee no longer has its own scheme, and is contributing to WSSA&#x27;s from now on), and the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also uses those classification schemes.

Manufacturers may recommend no more than a specified number of consecutive applications of a pesticide class be made before moving to a different pesticide class.

Two or more pesticides with different modes of action can be tankmixed on the farm to improve results and delay or mitigate existing pest resistance.

== Status ==

=== Glyphosate ===
Glyphosate-resistant weeds are now present in the vast majority of soybean, cotton, and corn farms in some U.S. states. Weeds resistant to multiple herbicide modes of action are also on the rise.

Before glyphosate, most herbicides would kill a limited number of weed species, forcing farmers to continually rotate their crops and herbicides to prevent resistance. Glyphosate disrupts the ability of most plants to construct new proteins. Glyphosate-tolerant transgenic crops are not affected.

A weed family that includes waterhemp (&quot;Amaranthus rudis&quot;) has developed glyphosate-resistant strains. A 2008 to 2009 survey of 144 populations of waterhemp in 41 Missouri counties revealed glyphosate resistance in 69%. Weed surveys from some 500 sites throughout Iowa in 2011 and 2012 revealed glyphosate resistance in approximately 64% of waterhemp samples.

In response to the rise in glyphosate resistance, farmers turned to other herbicides—applying several in a single season. In the United States, most midwestern and southern farmers continue to use glyphosate because it still controls most weed species, applying other herbicides, known as residuals, to deal with resistance.

The use of multiple herbicides appears to have slowed the spread of glyphosate resistance. From 2005 through 2010 researchers discovered 13 different weed species that had developed resistance to glyphosate. From 2010 to 2014 only two more were discovered.

A 2013 Missouri survey showed that multiply-resistant weeds had spread. 43% of the sampled weed populations were resistant to two different herbicides, 6% to three and 0.5% to four. In Iowa a survey revealed dual resistance in 89% of waterhemp populations, 25% resistant to three and 10% resistant to five.

Resistance increases pesticide costs. For southern cotton, herbicide costs climbed from between a few years ago to about in 2014. In the South, resistance contributed to the shift that reduced cotton planting by 70% in Arkansas and 60% in Tennessee. For soybeans in Illinois, costs rose from about .

=== &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; ===
During 2009 and 2010, some Iowa fields showed severe injury to corn producing Bt toxin Cry3Bb1 by western corn rootworm. During 2011, mCry3A corn also displayed insect damage, including cross-resistance between these toxins. Resistance persisted and spread in Iowa. Bt corn that targets western corn rootworm does not produce a high dose of Bt toxin, and displays less resistance than that seen in a high-dose Bt crop.

Products such as Capture LFR (containing the pyrethroid bifenthrin) and SmartChoice (containing a pyrethroid and an organophosphate) have been increasingly used to complement Bt crops that farmers find alone to be unable to prevent insect-driven injury. Multiple studies have found the practice to be either ineffective or to accelerate the development of resistant strains.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command in Unix-like operating systems, Microsoft 
Windows, and ReactOS used to schedule commands to be executed once, at a particular time in the future.

==Design==
===Unix-like===
On Unix-like operating systems, codice_1 reads a series of commands from standard input and collects them into one &quot;at-job&quot; which is carried out at a later date. The job inherits the current environment, so that it is executed in the same working directory and with the same environment variables set as when it was scheduled.
It differs from codice_3, which is used for recurring executions (e.g. once an hour, every Tuesday, January 1 every year). As with codice_4, many Unix systems allow the administrator to restrict access to the codice_1 command.
codice_1 can be made to mail a user when done carrying out a scheduled job, can use more than one job queue, and can read a list of jobs to carry out from a file instead of standard input.
The Linux codice_1 command was mostly written by Thomas Koenig.

===Microsoft Windows and ReactOS===
In addition to the graphical user interface for Windows Task Scheduler in Control Panel, Windows provides an codice_8 command that schedules commands and programs to run on a computer at a specified time and date (similar to codice_3). It is available since Windows NT, but is now deprecated in favor of codice_10. It can only be used when the Schedule service is running. When used without parameters, codice_8 lists scheduled commands.
codice_8 cannot access tasks created or modified by Control Panel or codice_13. Also, tasks created with codice_8 are not interactive by default; interactivity needs to be explicitly requested.

The ReactOS implementation is based on the Windows variant. It was developed by Eric Kohl and is licensed under the GPLv2.

==Usage==
===Unix-like===
A sample command to compile a C program at 11:45 a. m. on January 31 would be:
$ echo &quot;cc -o foo foo.c&quot; | at 1145 jan 31

or

$ at 1145 jan 31
at&gt; cc -o foo foo.c
at&gt; ^D #(press Control-D while at the beginning of a line)
The codice_15 program lists the currently queued jobs, while codice_16 removes jobs from the queue:

$ atq
1234 2011-08-12 11:45 cc -o foo foo.c user
$ atrm 1234 
$ atq


In some Unix-like computer operating systems, it uses a daemon, codice_17, which waits in the background periodically checking the list of jobs to do and executing those at their scheduled time on behalf of codice_1.

====Variants====
The codice_19 command can be used instead of at to only run scheduled jobs if the system&#x27;s load average is below a certain value.

===Microsoft Windows and ReactOS===
To use codice_8, the user must be a member of the local Administrators group.

The command-syntax is:


; codice_21 : This parameter specifies a remote computer. If it is omitted, at schedules the commands and programs on the local computer.
; codice_22 : This parameter specifies the identification number assigned to a scheduled command.
; codice_23 : This parameter cancels a scheduled command. If ID is omitted, all of the scheduled commands on the computer are canceled.
; codice_24 : This parameter answers yes to all queries from the system when you delete scheduled events.
; codice_25 : This parameter specifies the time when to run the command.
; codice_26 : This parameter allows the given command to interact with the desktop of the user who is logged on at the time command runs.
; codice_27 : This parameter runs the given command on every specified day or days of the week or month.
; codice_28 : This parameter specifies the date when to run the given command. One or more days of the week can be specified. If date is omitted, at uses the current day of the month.
; codice_29 : This parameter runs command on the next occurrence of the day.
; codice_30 : This parameter specifies the Windows command, program (that is, .exe or .com file), or batch program (that is, .bat or .cmd file) that will be run.
; codice_31 : Displays help for the command.

<doc id="216156" wikidata="Q531247" url="?curid=216156" title="Ray Mabus">
<text>Raymond Edwin Mabus Jr. (; born October 11, 1948) is an American politician and lawyer. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 75th United States Secretary of the Navy from 2009 to 2017. Mabus previously served as the State auditor of Mississippi from 1984 to 1988, as the 60th governor of Mississippi from 1988 to 1992, and as the United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1994 to 1996.

==Early life and education==
Mabus was born on October 11, 1948, in Ackerman, Choctaw County, Mississippi. He was the only child of Raymond Mabus Sr. (1901–1986), a successful timber farmer, and Lucille (née Curtis) Mabus (1909–2000), a teacher. His paternal uncle, merchant Leslie E. Mabus (1896–1992), was a member of the Mississippi State Senate from 1932 to 1936.

Mabus graduated from Ackermann High School in 1966 as class valedictorian. He graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from the University of Mississippi, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi, with a Bachelor of Arts in English and political science. He earned a Master of Arts in political science from Johns Hopkins University and a Juris Doctor, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, from Harvard Law School. He had been offered a Fulbright Scholarship, had held a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, and had traveled widely throughout Europe, the Middle East, Russia, and Latin America. Prior to attending law school, he also served two years in the Navy as a surface warfare officer from 1970 to 1972 aboard the cruiser , achieving the rank of lieutenant junior grade. He worked as a law clerk in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and as a legal counsel to a subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Agriculture.

==Early political career==
Mabus volunteered for William F. Winter&#x27;s unsuccessful gubernatorial candidacy in 1967. Following Winter&#x27;s successful election to the governorship in 1979, Mabus returned to Mississippi to work as the governor&#x27;s legal counsel in 1980. While in office, Winter and his staff pushed through a legislative overhaul of the state&#x27;s public education system. Mabus was one of several of the governor&#x27;s aides who delivered lectures across the state to build popular support for the reform bill. 

State Senator Ellis B. Bodron, who was broadly opposed to the legislation, denounced Mabus and the other young Winter aides—including Dick Molpus, David Crews, Bill Gartin, Andy P. Mullins, and John Henegan—as the &quot;Boys of Spring&quot;, a moniker which they thereafter took pride in. Mabus also helped draft an open records law and more stringent driving under the influence legislation. He left the counsel position in 1983.

==Mississippi State Auditor==
=== Election ===
While working on Winter&#x27;s staff in 1982, Mabus requested that the Department of Audit supply him with the latest three audit reports for Hinds County government. The department sent him three reports, with the latest dated 1977. Surprised, Mabus reminded the department that he wanted the three latest audits. The department informed him that 1977 was the last year in which an audit of the county was conducted, and that all audits were being conducted on a five-year-delay. Aspiring to run for elective office, Mabus researched the position of State Auditor. He realized the office had the power to investigate nearly all state and local government agencies, later saying, &quot;I did a radical thing. I went and read the statute. That office had more jurisdiction than almost any in the state of Mississippi. It had never been used. It&#x27;s the one place you can combat corruption without changing the law. It was sitting there, waiting for somebody like me to come along.&quot; Concluding that it could be &quot;the most powerful office in the state&quot;, he decided to run for the position of State Auditor in the 1983 elections.

In the 1983 Democratic primary, Mabus faced Department of Audit employee Mason Shelby and former radio station owner Murray Cain. Shelby was viewed as the favorite of the outgoing state auditor, Hamp King, and other leaders in the department. Mabus and Cain criticized the department for which Shelby worked as outdated in its methods and a part of an old boy network. Mabus declared that the department was two to four years behind on most of its audits. King wrote an open letter to Mabus rejecting his claims as exaggerations and asked a legislative committee to conduct a review of the Department of Audit. Mabus ultimately won the election, and the legislative report was published in December. The committee identified several flaws with the department&#x27;s structure and practices, and determined that it was delinquent for 581 fiscal years worth of audits.

=== Tenure ===
Mabus was sworn in as state auditor on January 5, 1984. At the time he took office, he found the audit department was disorganized; in addition to being behind on hundreds of years&#x27; worth of audits, it had no filing system and thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of checks for auditing services performed for local governments and other agencies were stored in a shoebox in the auditor&#x27;s office. Mabus convinced the legislature to permit the department to contract out auditing services to private Certified Public Accountant firms to work on the backlog. Using these strategies, the office eliminated the backlog in two years. On July 1, 1985, his office adopted Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for financial reporting. His office also released a single comprehensive annual financial report for state government for the 1986 fiscal year instead of separate reports for each state agency, the first time this had been done in Mississippi. The consolidated report was well-received, and the legislature subsequently mandated the issuance of a comprehensive financial report by statute, though it transferred the responsibility for the document&#x27;s publication to the Fiscal Management Board.

Mabus discovered early in his tenure that many department auditors conducting reviews of county government finances were forced to piece together county accounting records as they worked. Though the state charged $25 per day it took to work on a county audit, most counties found this preferable than paying to maintain their own accounting. Many auditors found that records were missing, which Mabus feared might conceal evidence of fraud. In order to improve county accounting practices, he created a new requirement that county governments maintain up-to-date accounting records, raised the cost of daily auditing services to $100, and appointed a head of an investigative division in the department. He had field auditors supplied with undercover tags so that their vehicles could not be traced during their investigations.

Mabus warned the Mississippi Association of Supervisors that he would enforce financing laws strictly and would disapprove of misuse of local government resources or noncompliance with purchasing practices. In order to ease compliance, he created a technical assistance division in the Department of Audit to provide legal and accounting advice to county boards of supervisors. He also met with each of the 82 county boards to advise them of relevant state laws and his expectations. To deal with complaints of misconduct, he created a departmental hotline to field public grievances. The hotline received numerous complaints from across the state, accusing county supervisors of various acts of malfeasance including misusing county resources for private purposes, signing contracts with companies despite conflicts of interest, gifting away government funds to charities, and extorting contractors. Mabus&#x27; office ultimately audited all 82 counties during his term, enabling five to have their bond ratings restored and leading to $1.7 million in misused funds being returned to the state. His actions infuriated many county supervisors.

Early in his term Mabus began collaborating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a corruption investigation into Mississippi county governments known as Operation Pretense. For the purposes of secrecy, initially only Mabus and his chief investigator in his department were aware of the scope of the federal investigation, until the first indictments against county officials were announced in February 1987. By the time Operation Pretense was finished, 57 public officials were indicted. The Department of Audit&#x27;s contribution to the investigation was mostly limited to providing purchasing records for federal prosecutors to use as evidence of wrongdoing. Upon the public reveal of the investigation, Mabus appealed to the state legislature to switch counties from the beat system of government to the unit system, mandate the hiring of professional county administrators, and strengthen county record-keeping standards. He also advised restricting federally-convicted criminals from holding public office, barring convicted vendors from securing government contracts, and creating a white collar crimes unit in the office of the Attorney General of Mississippi. He was succeeded as State Auditor by Pete Johnson on January 7, 1988.

==Governor of Mississippi==
=== 1987 election ===
Mabus began planning a gubernatorial bid in 1985 and formally declared his candidacy four days after Operation Pretense was revealed to the public in 1987. Incumbent William Allain did not seek reelection. In the Democratic primary he faced seven other candidates, including former governor Bill Waller, Attorney General Ed Pittman, Maurice Dantin, John Arthur Eaves, and Mike Sturvidant. Mabus had an advantage in being from northeast Mississippi, which usually heavily participated in Democratic primaries. He also enjoyed the good faith of many journalists for cracking down on corruption. Some warned that county supervisors would organize against him as retaliation for his work as auditor, but these fears proved unfounded. Mabus led in the August 4 primary with 37 percent of the vote, while Sturvidant—who spent heavily on his campaign—placed second with 16 percent. A runoff was held on August 25 in which Mabus took 65 percent of the vote, the largest-ever margin of victory in a runoff in the state&#x27;s history.

In the 1987 general election Mabus faced Republican Jack Reed. A businessman from Tupelo, Reed had worked with Winter on education reform and ran as a moderate, leaving voters with the impression that the two candidates had little to distinguish one from the other. Mabus ran with the slogan &quot;Mississippi will never be last again,&quot; and while his campaign did not articulate many specific stances, it emphasized a theme of change. He pledged to raise the state&#x27;s teacher salaries to the Southeastern average, which Reed criticized as necessitating either a tax hike or funding cuts to other government responsibilities. Mabus spent a total of $2.9 million on his campaign, the most ever spent on a Mississippi gubernatorial candidacy. He won with 53.4 percent of the vote, relying on a coalition of support from blacks, urbanites, and traditional Democrats from the northeastern portion of the state. About two-thirds of the white electorate voted against him, but he secured almost 90 percent of the black vote. Mabus was inaugurated as the 60th Governor of Mississippi on January 12, 1988. Aged 39, he was the youngest governor in the country.

=== Executive action and appointments ===
Mabus staffed his gubernatorial administration with a significant number of political moderates from outside the state. He appointed the first black members to the State Tax Commission and the first woman head of the Department of Public Safety. Mabus had potential judicial appointments vetted by a commission before making a selection among their nominees.

=== Legislative action ===
==== County reform ====
At the beginning of his term, Mabus enjoyed the cooperation of legislators and an $85 million budget surplus. In 1988 he proposed a bill to the legislature which would require counties to switch from the beat system to the unit system and hire a professional county administrator to handle financial matters and purchasing. The State Senate passed a bill which mandated a transition by all counties to switch to a loose form of the unit system, while the House of Representatives endorsed legislation which would allow counties to switch to a full unit system following a local referendum. A conference committee was unable to reconcile the two different proposals before they expired on the legislative calendar. The legislature successfully passed a bill raising supervisor&#x27;s salaries, which Mabus vetoed on April 30. In early June he declared that he would call the legislature into special session to consider the unit system legislation, and the session was eventually scheduled for August 10. Addressing the legislature in joint session, Mabus denounced the beat system as an antiquated form of government which &quot;made stealing too easy and too tempting&quot; and created inefficiency. On August 16, the legislature passed the County Government Reorganization Act, which stipulated that counties were to decide on what form of government to use in a November referendum, and further stipulated requirements for implementation of the unit system. Mabus signed the bill into law. County supervisors began drawing up cost estimates of implementing the unit system, with estimates from 47 different counties varying from $500 to $1.48 million. Mabus and other observers denounced the estimates as exaggerated and criticized them for not incorporating cost-savings projections post-transition. In November, 46 of the 82 counties voted to adopt the unit system, with 61 percent of voters backing the switch. Mabus established the Governor&#x27;s County Unit Task Force in January 1991 to examine the progress of the unit transition and recommend improvements. None of its findings were used due to the end of Mabus&#x27; term.

==== State fiscal reform and budgetary issues ====
During the 1988 session, Mabus vetoed a bill which would have forced the Fiscal Management Board—which he chaired as governor—to uniformly reduce expenditures if a projected revenue shortfall became apparent. He also convinced the legislature to appropriate the projected revenue surplus towards increasing schoolteacher salaries, and successfully lobbied the body to adopt several government reorganization recommendations, including the creation of a Department of Finance and Administration, which replaced the Fiscal Management Board and assumed its responsibilities for making budget recommendations and fiscal adjustments. The reorganization also led to the abolition of the State Eleemosynary Board and charitable hospitals, with the latter&#x27;s funds subsequently diverted to the state Medicaid program. Mabus was disappointed that the legislature did not adopt the majority of his proposals—which would have greatly reduced the number of state boards and commissions—but claimed that those enacted saved the state at least $928,744 annually. In the 1989 session he proposed the legislature authorize the issuance of general obligation bonds to fund a five-year capital improvement plan and thereby free up general revenue for other services. The bond proposal expired due to disagreement between the Senate and House, so Mabus called the legislature into special session to address the issue. The legislature authorized the issuance of $78.1 million in bonds for the 1990 fiscal year, and in the 1990 session authorized the issuance of an additional $69.5 million in bonds. Facing a $120 million budget shortfall in early 1991, Mabus imposed large cuts to state expenditures as required by law.

==== B.E.S.T. ====
Mabus decided to focus on improving public education during the 1990 legislative session. By the time the legislature had convened in January, the governor had circulated his education plan across the state. The platform—Better Education for Success Tomorrow or B.E.S.T.—included new adult and family literacy programs, a program to ameliorate the high school dropout rate, the creation of health clinics in schools, a plan to monitor schools with subpar performance and financially reward and reduce restrictions on schools with excellent performance, and the establishment of a new school construction and facility repair fund. In funding his proposals, Mabus eschewed sales or income tax increases, arguing that &quot;the working people of Mississippi pay enough taxes&quot;, and argued for the establishment of a state lottery. The state constitution banned lotteries, and could only be amended by public referendum following the approval of two-thirds of the legislature. The Senate refused to approve a referendum, but the legislature passed most of B.E.S.T. with the added provision that the program would expire on June 30 if no funding was ultimately found for it.

On June 18, Mabus called the legislature into special session to consider various plans for funding B.E.S.T.. He suggested several options for the body to consider including the lottery, gambling taxes, or higher government service fees, but refused to consider tax increases, arguing that the state had overused that option for previous education improvements. The legislature ultimately adjourned without approving a funding plan. Mabus continued to lobby for the financing of B.E.S.T. for another year without success. As time went on, many legislators began to feel Mabus was arrogant and did not want to be an equal partner in creating public policy for the state. Focus groups convened by Mabus&#x27; campaign organization in the aftermath of the special session largely interpreted the governor&#x27;s failure as a result of his unwillingness to compromise with the legislature.

He gave teachers the largest pay raise in the nation; and was named one of &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot;&#x27;s ten &quot;best education governors&quot;.

=== Political affairs ===
In January 1988, Mabus indicated that he wanted to replace the chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party, Ed Cole, the first black man to hold the position. The move rankled many black Democrats in the state. Some of Cole&#x27;s supporters accused Mabus of racism, but most criticized him for attempting to effect a personal takeover of the party. Mabus and his allies attempted to cast Cole as an &quot;old guard&quot; moderate of an ineffective organization while portraying his desired candidate, Billie Thompson, as an effective reformer and fundraiser. On April 9, the party&#x27;s executive committee voted to reelect Cole as chairman. In his victory speech, Cole declared, &quot;I want [Mabus] to know that he belongs to our party and our party does not belong to him.&quot;

=== 1991 election ===

Enabled by a gubernatorial succession amendment ratified in 1986, Mabus became the first Mississippi governor to run for reelection in the 20th century. In the 1991 Democratic primary he faced former U.S. Congressman Wayne Dowdy, who ran with the slogan &quot;Save us from Mabus&quot;, and George Blair. Styling himself a populist, Dowdy ran an old-style campaign and attempted to portray Mabus as arrogant, calling him &quot;the ruler&quot;. He also mocked Mabus&#x27; 1987 slogan by saying that if elected &quot;Mississippi would never be lost again&quot;. Mabus denounced his opponent as part of the &quot;old guard&quot; of Mississippi politicians and criticized his attendance record in the U.S. Congress. Equipped with more financial resources, Mabus&#x27; spent five times the amount of Dowdy and won in the primary with 50.7 percent of the vote.

In the general election Mabus faced Republican Kirk Fordice, a former Vicksburg construction executive. Fordice had not been expected by most observers to win his own primary and thus entered the general election with momentum, while Mabus had been harmed by his narrow victory in the Democratic contest. Mabus&#x27; campaign focused on attempting to make Fordice unappealing, while Fordice&#x27;s campaign concentrated their efforts on turning the election into a referendum on Mabus&#x27; performance.

Fordice declared his support for legislative term limits and welfare reform. He labeled Mabus a &quot;Kennedyesque liberal&quot; who focused too much on education and criticized his deficit spending. Republican-hosted focus groups found the governor to be &quot;aloof&quot; and unconcerned with the necessities of &quot;average&quot; Mississippians and Fordice&#x27;s signature campaign television ad attacked the incumbent for having &quot;tried&quot; but &quot;not accomplished much&quot;. Mabus continued to advocate support for public education and attack Fordice as a lobbyist and outsider who did not appreciate the needs of the state. Later in the campaign, race became an issue, as Fordice declared his support for workfare and ending racial quotas. Mabus aired a series of television ads which accused Fordice of planning to shut down the state&#x27;s historically black schools.

The governor spent twice as much as his opponent and held an edge in polls up to the election, but many potential voters identified themselves as undecided. On November 5, Fordice won with 50.8 percent to Mabus&#x27; 47.6 percent, the first Republican victory in a Mississippi gubernatorial race since 1874. Having received six percent less of the total vote share than in 1987, several observers blamed Mabus&#x27; loss on perception that he was an arrogant leader. Turnout among black voters was also lower in 1991, and some national Democrats accused Fordice of using race-baiting tactics. Mabus was succeeded by Fordice on January 14, 1992.

==Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and aftermath==
Mabus was appointed by President Bill Clinton to be the United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 1, 1994, he served until 1996, when he resigned to return to Mississippi to work for his family&#x27;s lumber business. During his tenure five Americans were killed in a bombing at a military training installation in Riyadh. Before he departed, the Saudi Arabian government inducted him into the Order of King Abdulaziz.

After his return to Mississippi, Mabus practiced law. In 2000 he took an executive position at Foamex International. He served as the company&#x27;s CEO during a bankruptcy reorganization and resigned from the post in 2007 to spend more time in Mississippi.

==Secretary of the Navy==
=== Appointment ===


In 2008 Mabus campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in Mississippi, who was subsequently elected President of the United States. On March 27, 2009, Mabus was nominated by Obama to be appointed Secretary of the Navy. He was sworn in on May 19, 2009, and held a ceremonial swearing in at Washington Navy Yard on June 18, 2009, where he was re-sworn in by the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.

=== Great Green Fleet ===
Several months after taking office, Mabus declared that he wanted to originate half of all of the Navy&#x27;s power needs from non-petroleum sources by 2020. As part of this, he declared that a number of ships would be covered under a &quot;Great Green Fleet&quot; initiative in which half of them would be partly powered by sources other than fossil fuels. He argued that using alternative energy sources would reduce the force&#x27;s reliance on foreign oil imports and thereby increase its energy independence. The Navy experimented with biofuels during his tenure, though their high expense often garnered skepticism, including when Senator John McCain noted that one report of a 2012 exercise showed that a half biodiesel fuel blend cost the Navy $26.75 per gallon instead of the usual $3.25 per gallon. As a result, Congress required all major purchases of alternative fuels to be conducted at competitive prices. In 2016 the Navy introduced a beef-fat fuel blend that cost $2.05 per gallon. Later in his tenure the destroyer successfully operated on a biofuel blend that cost only $1.99 per gallon, a fact which Mabus claimed was overlooked.

===Ship naming controversies===

As Navy secretary, Mabus was given the responsibility of naming the force&#x27;s ships. In April 2010 a furor arose when it was reported that Mabus made the proposal to name a United States Navy warship the after the late Pennsylvania Democratic congressman John Murtha. Additional naming controversies occurred due to the naming of the auxiliary ship after civil rights activist Cesar Chavez and a littoral combat ship the in honor of former Arizona Democratic Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, after she suffered life-threatening wounds in the 2011 mass shooting in her home district of Tucson, Arizona.

Subsequent ship namings include his January 6, 2016, announcement of his naming of another auxiliary ship after civil rights activist and sitting incumbent Georgia Democratic Congressman John Lewis (i.e., ). Mabus further stated that this particular class of auxiliary ship, of which the &quot;John Lewis&quot; would be the lead ship, would all be named after civil rights leaders. In April he announced his plans to name a destroyer after former Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Carl Levin. Congressional Republicans accused Mabus of politicizing the ship-naming process, and Representative Steven Palazzo unsuccessfully attempted to amend a defense appropriation bill to bar the secretary from naming ships after congressmen who were not military service members. On July 14 Mabus named a ship after gay rights icon and San Francisco Democratic politician Harvey Milk.

=== Gulf Coast recovery ===
In June 2010, Obama ordered Mabus to draft a long-term plan to restore the condition of the Gulf Coast in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Some regional businessmen and environmentalists were critical of the assignment, being troubled by Mabus&#x27; previous investments in energy trading companies and worried that as the secretary of navy, he would not be able to devote his full attention to the cleanup effort. He introduced a recovery plan in September which received bipartisan support in Congress. Based on his recommendations, Congress subsequently passed the RESTORE Act, allocating over $5 billion to rehabilitate the coast.

===Budget disputes===
After a January 2015 report by the Defense Business Board and McKinsey &amp; Company discovered the U.S. Department of Defense was spending $134 billion—23% of its total budget—on back-office work, and that the back-office bureaucracy staff of over one million people was nearly as great as the number of active troops, the board recommended a plan to cut $125 billion in waste over five years. However, when Ash Carter became defense secretary the next month, he replaced the board chairman, the McKinsey results were classified as secret, and its report was removed from public websites. Mabus then gave a speech at the American Enterprise Institute highlighting the McKinsey report, calling the back-office costs &quot;pure overhead&quot; and particularly criticizing the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Defense Logistics Agency. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall III then wrote to him asking &quot;please refrain from taking any more public pot shots [...] I do not want this spilling over into further public discourse.&quot;

Throughout his tenure, Mabus contracted the building of 86 ships for the navy. In 2016 he drafted a budget for the navy for the 2018 fiscal year, which included billions of dollars earmarked for building dozens of additional ships. Carter&#x27;s draft budget for the Department of Defense did not reflect this appropriation, and in December 2016 Mabus released a memo stating that he did not wish to cut money from shipbuilding, citing the decline in the size of the navy from 2001 to 2008. He also told Carter that &quot;you and I both know that this budget is almost totally a symbolic one,&quot; making note of the impending end of Obama&#x27;s tenure.

===Personnel affairs===
Mabus stated that he placed emphasis on &quot;developing a more diverse force&quot; during his tenure. Some personnel accused him of promoting &quot;social engineering&quot; policies. The United States Armed Forces&#x27; &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy towards gay servicemen ended in 2011. Two years later the Navy introduced randomized breathalyzer tests for on-duty sailors to curb alcohol abuse. Mabus created new Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps programs at different universities, including Harvard University and Arizona State University. He also removed zone distinctions from promotion considerations, allowing personnel to be considered equally for rank promotions without regard towards their specializations. At his direction the Navy introduced expanded graduate school-level education offerings and created a program to offer excelling junior officers to work for three years at Fortune 500 companies. He arranged for women to enter the submarine fleet in 2011. Mabus also pushed for the introduction of unisex uniforms in the Navy and the United States Marine Corps. In July 2015 he expanded the maternity leave of Navy Department personnel to 18 weeks, though Carter later trimmed this to 12 weeks across all armed forced in January 2016.

In late 2015 the Marine Corps released the results of a nine-month-long study on female performance in the corps, concluding that the average woman recruit was injured twice as often men, less accurate with infantry weapons, and not as effective at recovering wounded troops from the battlefield. Mabus immediately dismissed the findings, saying the Marine Corps failed to describe the effectiveness of the highest-performing women and did not provide sufficient reason to continue to exclude women from the most demanding roles in the corps. Following an instruction from Defense Secretary Carter, on January 1, 2016, Mabus ordered the Marine Corps to draft a plan to make all of its training co-ed within 15 days and directed the service to make all job-titles gender neutral. He subsequently met with Marine Commandant General Robert B. Neller and agreed to leave boot camp segregated by gender. His actions provoked the ire of members of Congress, with Representative Duncan D. Hunter demanding his resignation and others criticizing the narrow timeframe he had given the corps.

===Departure===
Mabus declared in March 2016 that he would consider retirement and stepped down as Secretary of the Navy on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of President Donald Trump. He was succeeded by Assistant Navy Secretary Sean Stackley, who became acting secretary pending the confirmation of a new permanent secretary. Mabus was one of only a few national security officials to serve continuously during Obama&#x27;s entire tenure and the longest-serving secretary of the navy since Josephus Daniels, who served from 1913 to 1921. He declared, &quot;For me, leading the Department of the Navy is the greatest honor of my life.&quot;

==Awards, honors, community service==

Mabus has been awarded the U.S. Department of Defense Distinguished Public Service Award, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Martin Luther King Jr. Social Responsibility Award from the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, the National Wildlife Federation Conservation Achievement Award, the King Abdulaziz Award from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Mississippi Association of Educators&#x27; Friend of Education Award.

He was included in Glassdoor&#x27;s 2013 list of &quot;Highest Rated CEOs&quot; at 43rd place with an 82% approval rate. In 2017 the Mississippi Center for Justice accorded Mabus its Champion of Justice award. In 2019 the town of Ackermann erected historic markers honoring both Mabus and fellow town native former governor J. P. Coleman at Governor&#x27;s Park.

He is active in many community activities, primarily focusing on education. Following Hurricane Katrina, he founded the Help and Hope Foundation, which works to meet the needs of children affected by the storm.

==Personal life==
Mabus married Julie Hines, the daughter of a Jackson banker, in 1987, shortly before he ran for governor. Some observers speculated that the marriage was meant to improve his image before the campaign. They had two daughters together. They divorced in 2000, with the separation proceedings and the following custody dispute over their children marked by bitterness. A Hinds County court ultimately granted Mabus shared custody with the children. He married Lynne Horecky in 2007.

Mabus is a fan of the Boston Red Sox having first followed the team during the 1975 World Series while a student at Harvard Law School. During his tenure as Navy Secretary, he threw ceremonial first pitches at all 30 major league baseball parks in the United States, the only person ever believed to have done so.

===Acting===
In 2009, and again in 2014, Mabus made cameo appearances on the TV drama &quot;NCIS&quot; in the Season 7 episode &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, and in the Season 12 episode &quot;Semper Fortis&quot;, as an NCIS Agent named &quot;Ray&quot;. In 2012, he appeared in the movie &quot;Battleship&quot; as the commanding officer of the . Mabus made a cameo appearance as himself in the &quot;It&#x27;s Not a Rumor&quot; episode of the TV series &quot;The Last Ship&quot;, issuing orders to the crew of the &quot;Nathan James&quot; via a recorded message; in the storyline, by the time the ship received the orders, Mabus had succumbed to the &quot;Red Flu&quot; virus.

<text>In botany, a pseudobulb is a storage organ found in many epiphytic and terrestrial sympodial orchids. It is derived from a thickening of the part of a stem between leaf nodes and may be composed of just one internode or several, termed &quot;heteroblastic&quot; and &quot;homoblastic&quot; respectively. All leaves and inflorescences usually arise from this structure. Pseudobulbs formed from a single internode produce the leaves and inflorescence from the top, while those that are formed from several internodes can possess leaves along its length. The modified sheath leaves that appear at the base of a pseudobulb and often enfold all or part of it are usually dry and papery, though in some orchids the sheaths bear leaf blades and the leaves at the pseudobulb&#x27;s apex are reduced to scales.

In some species, it is hardly swollen at all and looks like a normal stem with many leaves, while at the other extreme some genera such as &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; have single, spherical pseudobulbs with one (or two) leaves at the apex of each. Whether cane-like (with many joints) or spherical (with one or few joints), they are all produced from a long-lived creeping stem called a rhizome which may itself be climbing or pendulous. The pseudobulbs are relatively short lived (1–5 years), but are continually produced from the growing tip of the rhizome and may persist for years after its last leaves senesce.

The term pseudobulb is used to distinguish the above-ground storage organ from other storage organs derived from stems that were underground, namely corms or true bulbs, a combination of an underground stem and storage leaves. Strictly speaking, there is no clear distinction between the pseudobulb and corm structures.

<doc id="216159" wikidata="Q13583713" url="?curid=216159" title="Chemical waste">
<text>Chemical waste is any excess, unused, or unwanted chemical. Chemical waste may be classified as hazardous waste, non-hazardous waste, universal waste, or household hazardous waste, each of which is regulated separately by national governments and the United Nations. Hazardous waste is material that displays one or more of the following four characteristics: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. This information, along with chemical disposal requirements, is typically available on a chemical&#x27;s Safety Data Sheet (SDS). Radioactive and biohazardous wastes require additional or different methods of handling and disposal, and are often regulated differently than standard hazardous wastes.

== Laboratory chemical waste in the US ==
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prohibits disposing of certain materials down drains. Therefore, when hazardous chemical waste is generated in a laboratory setting, it is usually stored on-site in appropriate waste containers, such as triple-rinsed chemical storage containers or carboys, where it is later collected and disposed of in order to meet safety, health, and legislative requirements. Many universities&#x27; Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) divisions/departments serve this collection and oversight role.

Organic solvents and other organic waste is typically incinerated. Some chemical wastes are recycled, such as waste elemental mercury.

=== Laboratory waste containment ===
==== Packaging ====
During packaging, chemical liquid waste containers are filled to no greater than 75% capacity to allow for vapor expansion and to reduce potential spills that can occur from transporting or moving overfilled containers. Containers for chemical liquid waste are typically constructed from materials compatible with the hazardous waste being stored, such as inert materials like polypropylene (PP) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). These containers are also constructed of mechanically robust materials in order to minimize leakage during storage or transit.

In addition to the general packaging requirements mentioned above, precipitates, solids, and other non-fluid wastes are typically stored separately from liquid waste. Chemically contaminated glassware is disposed of separately from other chemical waste in containers that cannot be punctured by broken glass.

==== Labelling ====
Containers may be labelled with the group name from a list of chemical waste categories, along with an itemized list of the contents. All chemicals or materials contaminated by chemicals pose a significant hazard, and as such regulations require that the identity of the chemicals in a waste container is obvious.

==== Storage ====
Chemical waste containers are kept closed to prevent spillage, except when waste is being added. Suitable containers are labeled in order to inform disposal specialists of the contents as well as to prevent the addition of incompatible chemicals. Liquid waste is stored in containers with secure screw-top or similar lids that cannot be easily dislodged in transit. Solid waste is stored in various sturdy, chemically inert containers, such as large, sealed buckets or thick plastic bags. Secondary containment, such as trays or safety cabinets, are used to capture spills and leaks from the primary container and to segregate incompatible hazardous wastes, such as acids and bases.

=== Chemical compatibility guidelines ===
Many chemicals react adversely when combined. Incompatible chemicals are therefore stored in separate areas of laboratories.

Acids are separated from alkalis, metals, cyanides, sulfides, azides, phosphides, and oxidizers, as when acids combine with these types of compounds, violent exothermic reactions can occur. In addition, some of these reactions produce flammable gases, which, combined with the heat produced, may cause explosions. In the case of cyanides, sulfides, azides, phosphides, etc. Toxic gases are also produced.

Oxidizers are separated from acids, organic materials, metals, reducing agents, and ammonia, as when oxidizers combine with these types of compounds, flammable and sometimes toxic compounds can be created. Oxidizers also increase the likelihood that any flammable material present will ignite, seen most readily in research laboratories with improper storage of organic solvents.

To identify unknown chemicals, some waste companies have a Chemist on staff.

== Environmental pollution ==
===Pharmaceuticals===
====PPCPs====
==== River pollution ====

===Textile industry===
The textile industry is one of the largest polluters in the globalized world of mostly free market dominated socioeconomic systems. Chemically polluted textile wastewater degrades the quality of the soil and water. The pollution comes from the type of conduct of chemical treatments used e.g., in pretreatment, dyeing, printing, and finishing operations that many or most market-driven companies use despite &quot;eco-friendly alternatives&quot;. Textile industry wastewater is considered to be one the largest polluters of water and soil ecosystems, causing &quot;carcinogenic, mutagenic, genotoxic, cytotoxic and allergenic threats to living organisms&quot;. The textile industry uses over 8000 chemicals in its supply chain, also polluting the environment with large amounts of microplastics and has been identified in one review as the industry sector producing the largest amount of pollution.

A campaign of big clothing brands like Nike, Adidas and Puma to voluntarily reform their manufacturing supply chains to commit to achieving zero discharges of hazardous chemicals by 2020 (global goal) appears to have failed.

The textile industry also creates a lot of pollution that leads to externalities which can cause large economic problems. The problem usually occurs when there is no division of ownership rights. This means that the problem of pollution is largely caused because of incomplete information about which company pollutes and at what scale the damage was caused by the pollution.

===Planetary boundary===
A study by &quot;Scienmag&quot; defines a &#x27;planetary boundary&#x27; for novel entities such as plastic and chemical pollution. The study reported that the boundary has been crossed.

== Regulation of chemical waste ==
Chemicals waste may fall under regulations such as COSHH in the United Kingdom or the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), as well as state and local regulations, also regulate chemical use and disposal.

=== Chemical waste in Canadian aquaculture ===

Chemical waste in oceans is becoming a major issue for marine life. There have been many studies conducted to try and prove the effects of chemicals in oceans. In Canada, many of the studies concentrated on the Atlantic provinces, where fishing and aquaculture are an important part of the economy. In New Brunswick, a study was done on sea urchins in an attempt to identify the effects of toxic and chemical waste on life beneath the ocean, specifically the waste from salmon farms. Sea urchins were used to check the levels of metals in the environment. Green sea urchins have been used as they are widely distributed, abundant in many locations, and easily accessible. By investigating the concentrations of metals in the green sea urchins, the impacts of chemicals from salmon aquaculture activity could be assessed and detected. Samples were taken at 25-meter intervals along a transect in the direction of the main tidal flow. The study found that there were impacts to at least 75 meters based on the intestine metal concentrations.

<text>Industrial waste is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material that is rendered useless during a manufacturing process such as that of factories, mills, and mining operations. Types of industrial waste include dirt and gravel, masonry and concrete, scrap metal, oil, solvents, chemicals, scrap lumber, even vegetable matter from restaurants. Industrial waste may be solid, semi-solid or liquid in form. It may be hazardous waste (some types of which are toxic) or non-hazardous waste. Industrial waste may pollute the nearby soil or adjacent water bodies, and can contaminate groundwater, lakes, streams, rivers or coastal waters. Industrial waste is often mixed into municipal waste, making accurate assessments difficult. An estimate for the US goes as high as 7.6 billion tons of industrial waste produced annually, as of 2017. Most countries have enacted legislation to deal with the problem of industrial waste, but strictness and compliance regimes vary. Enforcement is always an issue.

==Classification of industrial waste and its treatment==

Hazardous waste, chemical waste, industrial solid waste and municipal solid waste are classifications of wastes used by governments in different countries. Sewage treatment plants can treat some industrial wastes, i.e. those consisting of conventional pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Industrial wastes containing toxic pollutants or high concentrations of other pollutants (such as ammonia) require specialized treatment systems. (&quot;See&quot; Industrial wastewater treatment).

Industrial wastes can be classified on the basis of their characteristics:
* Waste in solid form, but some pollutants within are in liquid or fluid form, e.g. crockery industry or washing of minerals or coal
* Waste in dissolved and the pollutant is in liquid form, e.g. the dairy industry.

==Environmental impact==
Many factories and most power plants are located near bodies of water to obtain large amounts of water for manufacturing processes or for equipment cooling. In the US, electric power plants are the largest water users. Other industries using large amounts of water are pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, iron and steel mills, petroleum refineries, food processing plants and aluminum smelters.

Many less-developed countries that are becoming industrialized do not yet have the resources or technology to dispose their wastes with minimal impacts on the environment. Both untreated and partially treated wastewater are commonly fed back into a near lying body of water. Metals, chemicals and sewage released into bodies of water directly affect marine ecosystems and the health of those who depend on the waters as food or drinking water sources. Toxins from the wastewater can kill off marine life or cause varying degrees of illness to those who consume these marine animals, depending on the contaminant. Metals and chemicals released into bodies of water affect the marine ecosystems.

Wastewater containing nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) often causes eutrophication which can kill off existing life in water bodies. A Thailand study focusing on water pollution origins found that the highest concentrations of water contamination in the U-tapao river had a direct correlation to industrial wastewater discharges.

Thermal pollution—discharges of water at elevated temperature after being used for cooling—can also lead to polluted water. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new thermophilic species.

Solid waste, often called municipal solid waste, typically refers to material that is not hazardous. This category includes trash, rubbish and refuse; and may include materials such as construction debris and yard waste. Hazardous waste typically has specific definitions, due to the more careful and complex handling required of such wastes. Under US law, waste may be classified as hazardous based on certain characteristics: ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity and toxicity. Some types of hazardous waste are specifically listed in regulations.

===Water pollution===
One of the most devastating effects of industrial waste is water pollution. For many industrial processes, water is used which comes in contact with harmful chemicals. These chemicals may include organic compounds (such as solvents), metals, nutrients or radioactive material. If the wastewater is discharged without treatment, groundwater and surface water bodies—lakes, streams, rivers and coastal waters—can become polluted, with serious impacts on human health and the environment. Drinking water sources and irrigation water used for farming may be affected. The pollutants may degrade or destroy habitat for animals and plants. In coastal areas, fish and other aquatic life can be contaminated by untreated waste; beaches and other recreational areas can be damaged or closed. 

==Management==
=== Hungary ===
Hungary&#x27;s first waste prevention program was their 2014-2020 national waste management plan. Their current program (2021-2027) is financed by European Union and international grants, domestic co-financing, product charges, and landfill taxes.

===Thailand===

In Thailand the roles in municipal solid waste (MSW) management and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is organized as central (national) government, regional government, and local government. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible for stimulating regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating the central and local governments. The local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area. However, the local governments do not dispose of the waste by themselves but instead hire private companies that have been granted the right from the Pollution Control Department (PCD) in Thailand. The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center, General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO), SGS Thailand, Waste Management Siam LTD (WMS), and Better World Green Public Company Limited (BWG). These companies are responsible for the waste they have received from their customers before releasing it to the environment, burying it.

===United States===

The 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) provides for federal regulation of industrial, household, and manufacturing solid and hazardous wastes in the United States. RCRA aims to conserve natural resources and energy, protect human health, eliminate or reduce waste, and to clean up waste when needed. RCRA first began as an amendment to the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, and in 1984, Congress passed the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) which strengthened RCRA by:

* Eliminating land disposal—land disposal means placing waste on or in land (e.g. injection wells, landfills, etc.), and the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) program (under HSWA) forbids untreated hazardous waste from land disposals, and requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set specific treatment standards that must be met before hazardous waste can be subject to land disposals. The LDR program also has a dilution prohibition, which asserts that hazardous waste cannot be diluted down by the handler as a means to avoid satisfying the treatment. 
*Waste minimization—the goal of waste minimization is to make sure that the amount of hazardous waste that is produced, and its toxicity levels, is as diminished as possible, and the EPA does this through source reduction and recycling. Source reduction (or pollution prevention (P2)) trims production of hazardous wastes right at its source, and is the EPA&#x27;s first step in material management with recycling being second. 
*Amplifying the EPA&#x27;s authority regarding corrective action—corrective action is when treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) must oblige with inquiring hazardous releases into ground and surface water, soil, and air, and clearing it up. Under the HSWA, the EPA can necessitate corrective action at permitted and non-permitted TSDFs. 
Furthermore, the EPA uses Superfund to find sites of contamination, identify the parties responsible, and in the occurrences where said parties are not known or able to, the program funds cleanups. Superfund also works on figuring out and applying final remedies for cleanups. The Superfund process is to: 1) collect necessary information (known as the Remedial Investigation (RI) phase); 2) assess alternatives to deal with any potential risks to the environmental and human health (known as the Feasibility Study (FS) stage); 3) determine the most suitable remedies that could lower the risks to more adequate levels. Some sites are so contaminated because of past waste disposals that it takes decades to clean them up, or bring the contamination down to acceptable levels, thus requiring long-term management over those sites. Hence, sometimes figuring out a final remedy is not possible, and so, the EPA has developed the Adaptive Management plan.

The EPA has issued national regulations regarding the handling, treatment and disposal of wastes. EPA has authorized individual state environmental agencies to implement and enforce the RCRA regulations through approved waste management programs.

State compliance is monitored by EPA inspections. In the case that waste management guideline standards are not met, action against the site will be taken. Compliance errors may be corrected by enforced cleanup directly by the site responsible for the waste or by a third party hired by that site. Prior to the enactment of the Clean Water Act (1972) and RCRA, open dumping or releasing wastewater into nearby bodies of water were common waste disposal methods. The negative effects on human health and environmental health led to the need for such regulations. The RCRA framework provides specified subsections defining nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials and how each should be properly managed and disposed of. Guidelines for the disposal of nonhazardous solid waste includes the banning of open dumping. Hazardous waste is monitored in a &quot;cradle to grave&quot; fashion; each step in the process of waste generation, transport and disposal is tracked. The EPA now manages 2.96 million tons of solid, hazardous and industrial waste. Since establishment, the RCRA program has undergone reforms as inefficiencies arise and as waste management processes evolve.

The 1972 Clean Water Act is a broad legislative mandate to protect surface waters (rivers, lakes and coastal water bodies). A 1948 law had authorized research and development of voluntary water standards, and had provided limited financing for state and local government efforts. The 1972 law prohibited, for the first time, uncontrolled discharges of industrial waste, as well as municipal sewage, into waters of the United States. EPA was required to develop national standards for industrial facilities and standards for municipal sewage treatment plants. States were required to develop water quality standards for individual water bodies. Enforcement is mainly delegated to state agencies. Major amendments to the law were passed in 1977 and 1987.

<text>A raw material, also known as a feedstock, unprocessed material, or primary commodity, is a basic material that is used to produce goods, finished goods, energy, or intermediate materials that are feedstock for future finished products. As feedstock, the term connotes these materials are bottleneck assets and are required to produce other products.

The term raw material denotes materials in unprocessed or minimally processed states such as raw latex, crude oil, cotton, coal, raw biomass, iron ore, plastic, air, logs, and water. The term secondary raw material denotes waste material which has been recycled and injected back into use as productive material.

==Raw material in supply chain==
Supply chains typically begin with the acquisition or extraction of raw materials. For example, the European Commission notes that food supply chains commence in the agricultural phase of food production. 

A 2022 report on changes affecting international trade noted that improving sourcing of raw materials has become one of the main objectives of companies reconfiguring their supply chains.

In a 2022 survey conducted by SAP, wherein 400 US-based leaders in logistics and supply chain were interviewed, 44% of respondents cited a lack of raw materials as a reason for their supply chain issues. Forecasting for 2023, 50% of respondents expect a reduced availability of raw materials in the US to drive supply chain disruptions.

=== Raw materials markets ===
Raw materials markets are affected by consumer behavior, supply chain uncertainty, manufacturing disruptions, and regulations, amongst other factors. This results in volatile raw materials markets that are difficult to optimize and manage. Companies can struggle when faced with raw material volatility due to a lack of understanding of market demands, poor or no visibility into the indirect supply chain, and the time lag of raw materials price changes.

Volatility in the raw materials markets can also be driven by natural disasters and geopolitcal conflict. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the steel industry, and once demand rebounded, prices increased 250% in the US. The Russian invasion of Ukraine caused the price of natural gas to increase by 50% in 2022.

==Raw material processing==
===Ceramic===
While pottery originated in many different points around the world, it is certain that it was brought to light mostly through the Neolithic Revolution. That is important because it was a way for the first agrarians to store and carry a surplus of supplies. While most jars and pots were fire-clay ceramics, Neolithic communities also created kilns that were able to fire such materials to remove most of the water to create very stable and hard materials. Without the presence of clay on the riverbanks of the Tigris and Euphrates in the Fertile Crescent, such kilns would have been impossible for people in the region to have produced. Using these kilns, the process of metallurgy was possible once the Bronze and Iron Ages came upon the people that lived there.

===Metallic===
Many raw metallic materials used in industrial purposes must first be processed into a usable state. Metallic ores are first processed through a combination of crushing, roasting, magnetic separation, flotation, and leaching to make them suitable for use in a foundry. Foundries then smelt the ore into usable metal that may be alloyed with other materials to improve certain properties. One metallic raw material that is commonly found across the world is iron, and combined with nickel, this material makes up over 35% of the material in the Earth&#x27;s inner and outer core. The iron that was initially used as early as 4000 BC was called meteoric iron and was found on the surface of the Earth. This type of iron came from the meteorites that struck the Earth before humans appeared, and was in very limited supply. This type is unlike most of the iron in the Earth, as the iron in the Earth was much deeper than the humans of that time period were able to excavate. The nickel content of the meteoric iron made it not necessary to be heated up, and instead, it was hammered and shaped into tools and weapons.

=== Iron ore ===

Iron ore can be found in a multitude of forms and sources. The primary forms of iron ore today are Hematite and Magnetite. While iron ore can be found throughout the world, only the deposits in the order of millions of tonnes are processed for industrial purposes. The top five exporters of Iron ore are Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Canada, and Ukraine. One of the first sources of iron ore is bog iron. Bog iron takes the form of pea-sized nodules that are created under peat bogs at the base of mountains.

== Conflicts of raw materials ==
Places with plentiful raw materials and little economic development often show a phenomenon known as &quot;Dutch disease&quot; or the &quot;resource curse&quot;, which occurs when the economy of a country is mainly based upon its exports because of its method of governance. An example of this is the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Kolbert mainly discusses the importance to modern civilization, and the finite sources of, six raw materials: high-purity quartz (needed to produce silicon chips), sand, iron, copper, petroleum (which Conway lumps together with another fossil fuel, natural gas), and lithium. Kolbert summarizes archeologist Colwell&#x27;s review of the evolution of technology, which has ended up giving the Global North a superabundance of &quot;stuff,&quot; at an unsustainable cost to the world&#x27;s environment and reserves of raw materials.

<doc id="216169" wikidata="Q180390" url="?curid=216169" title="Tom DeLay">
<text>Thomas Dale DeLay (; born April 8, 1947) is an American author and retired politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives. A Republican, DeLay represented Texas&#x27;s 22nd congressional district from 1985 until 2006. He served as House majority leader from 2003 to 2005.

DeLay began his political career in 1978 when he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1984. In 1988, DeLay was appointed deputy minority whip. In 1994, he helped Newt Gingrich orchestrate the Republican Revolution, which swept Democrats from power in both houses of Congress and put Republicans in control of the House of Representatives for the first time in forty years. In 1995, DeLay was elected House majority whip. With the Republicans in control of both chambers in Congress, DeLay and conservative activist Grover Norquist helped start the K Street Project in an effort to advance Republican ideals. DeLay was elected House majority leader after the 2002 midterm elections. He was known as a staunch conservative during his years in Congress.

In 2005, a Travis County grand jury indicted DeLay on criminal charges of conspiracy to violate election law by campaign money laundering. DeLay temporarily resigned from his position as House majority leader and later announced that he would not seek to return. He resigned his seat in Congress in June 2006. DeLay was convicted in January 2011 and sentenced to three years in prison, but was free on bail while appealing his conviction. The trial court&#x27;s judgment was overturned by the Austin Court of Appeals, a Texas intermediate appellate court, on September 19, 2013; the Court of Appeals ruled that &quot;the evidence in the case was &#x27;legally insufficient to sustain DeLay&#x27;s convictions, and acquitted DeLay. The acquittal was upheld on appeal.

After leaving Congress, DeLay co-authored a political memoir entitled &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender: One American&#x27;s Fight&quot;. He also founded First Principles, LLC, a lobbying firm.

==Early life and education==
DeLay was born in Laredo, Texas, one of three sons of Maxine Evelyn (née Wimbish) and Charles Ray DeLay. He spent most of his childhood in Venezuela due to his father&#x27;s work in the petroleum and natural gas industry. He attended Calallen High School in Corpus Christi, Texas, where he both played football and was the lead dancer in school productions. He attended Baylor University for two years, majoring in pre-med, but was expelled for drinking and painting Baylor school colors on a building at rival Texas A&amp;M University. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that DeLay &quot;received student draft deferments during the Vietnam era and avoided military service through the 1969 lottery&quot;. At the 1988 Republican Convention, he said that he could not volunteer to fight in Vietnam because so many minority youths had volunteered that there was literally no room for &quot;patriotic folks&quot; like himself.

DeLay graduated from the University of Houston in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science in biology.

==Early career==
After graduating from college, DeLay spent three years at pesticide-maker Redwood Chemical and then purchased Albo Pest Control, which DeLay grew into a large and successful business. This work was the source for his nickname, &quot;the Exterminator&quot;. In the 11 years DeLay ran the company, the Internal Revenue Service imposed three tax liens on him for failure to pay payroll and income taxes. The United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s ban on Mirex, a pesticide that was used in extermination work, led DeLay to oppose government regulation of businesses, a belief that he has carried with him throughout his political career.

==Political career==
===Local politics===
In 1978, DeLay won the election for an open seat in the Texas House of Representatives. He was the first Republican to represent Fort Bend County in the state House. He was first sworn in on January 9, 1979, as a representative from the 21st district and served in the state House until 1985. DeLay ran for U.S. Congress in 1984 from the 22nd District, after fellow Republican Ron Paul decided to run in the Republican primary for the 1984 U.S. Senate race instead of for reelection (Paul subsequently returned to Congress from a neighboring district). He easily won a crowded six-way primary with 53 percent of the vote, and cruised to election in November. DeLay was one of six freshmen Republican congressmen elected from Texas in 1984 known as the Texas Six Pack. He was reelected 10 times, never facing substantive opposition in what had become a solidly Republican district.

===Early congressional career===
As a member of the Republican minority in the 1980s, DeLay made a name for himself by criticizing the National Endowment for the Arts and the Environmental Protection Agency. During his first term in Congress, DeLay was appointed to the Republican Committee on Committees, which assigned representatives to House committees, and in his second term, he was appointed to the powerful House Appropriations Committee, a position that he retained until his election as majority leader in 2003. He was reappointed to the committee in 2006 after leaving his position as majority leader. He also served for a time as chairman of a group of conservative House Republicans known as the Republican Study Committee, and as Secretary of the House Republican Conference. DeLay was appointed as a deputy Republican whip in 1988.

===Majority whip===
When the Republican Party gained control of the House in 1995 following the 1994 election, or &quot;Republican Revolution&quot;, DeLay was elected Majority Whip against the wishes of House Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich.

DeLay was not always on good terms with Gingrich or Dick Armey, the House majority leader from 1995 to 2003, and he reportedly considered them uncommitted to Christian values. Nevertheless, in the heyday of the 104th Congress (1995–1997), DeLay described the Republican leadership as a triumvirate of Gingrich, &quot;the visionary&quot;; Armey, &quot;the policy &quot;; and himself, &quot;the ditch digger who makes it all happen&quot;.

In the summer of 1997, several House Republicans, who saw Speaker Newt Gingrich&#x27;s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted &quot;coup&quot; began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman John Boehner of Ohio and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House majority leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.

As Majority Whip, DeLay earned the nickname &quot;The Hammer&quot; for his enforcement of party discipline in close votes and his reputation for wreaking political vengeance on opponents. DeLay has expressed a liking for his nickname, pointing out that the hammer is one of a carpenter&#x27;s most valuable tools. In the 104th Congress, DeLay successfully whipped 300 out of 303 bills.

In 1998, DeLay worked to ensure that the House vote on impeaching President Bill Clinton was successful. DeLay rejected efforts to censure Clinton, who, DeLay said, had lied under oath. DeLay posited that the U.S. Constitution allowed the House to punish the president only through impeachment. He called on Clinton to resign and influenced Republican House members to vote to approve articles of impeachment.

In 1998, Newt Gingrich faced a second major attempt by House Republicans, including DeLay, to oust him as Speaker. Gingrich announced he would decline to take his seat in the upcoming Congress. After Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston and Dick Armey withdrew from consideration for the speakership, DeLay, as the third-ranking House Republican, had the inside track to the job. However, DeLay concluded that he would be &quot;too nuclear&quot; to lead the closely divided House that had resulted from the Republican House losses in 1996 and 1998. Instead, DeLay proposed his chief vote-counter, Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert, as a compromise candidate, since Hastert had very good relations on both sides of the aisle. As Congress reconvened in January 1999, Hastert was elected House Speaker, and DeLay was reelected House Majority Whip.

===Majority leader===

After serving as his party&#x27;s Whip for eight years, DeLay was elected majority leader upon the retirement of Dick Armey in 2003. His tenure as majority leader was marked by strong Republican party discipline and by parliamentary and redistricting efforts to preserve Republican control of the House. After his indictment on September 28, 2005, DeLay stepped down from his position as majority leader. He was the first congressional leader ever to be indicted. Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri took over as acting leader.

On January 7, 2006, after weeks of growing pressure from Republican colleagues, and particularly from Reps. Charlie Bass and Jeff Flake, who wanted to avoid being associated with DeLay&#x27;s legal issues in an election year, DeLay announced he would not seek to regain his position as majority leader.

====Legislative and electoral methods====
DeLay was known to &quot;primary&quot; Republicans who resisted his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative).

In the 108th Congress, a preliminary Medicare vote passed 216–215, a vote on Head Start passed 217–216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209–208, and &quot;Fast track&quot;, usually called &quot;trade promotion authority&quot;, passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay&#x27;s ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as &quot;growing the vote&quot;. DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills. One lobbyist said, &quot;I&#x27;ve had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I&#x27;ve never been asked to work on a bill—at least like they are asking us to whip bills now.&quot; His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay&#x27;s political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total.

Partly as a result of DeLay&#x27;s management abilities, the House Republican caucus under him displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion.

On September 30, 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay because he &quot;offered to endorse Representative Nick Smith&#x27;s son in exchange for Representative Smith&#x27;s vote in favor of the Medicare bill.&quot;

==Legal and ethical issues==

===Campaign finance charges===

Following official admonishments by the United States House Committee on Ethics, DeLay was charged in 2005 with money laundering and conspiracy charges related to illegal campaign finance activities aimed at helping Republican candidates for Texas state office in the 2002 elections. The indictment was sought by Ronnie Earle, the Democratic former District Attorney of Travis County (which includes the state capital of Austin). A first grand jury rejected Earle&#x27;s indictment attempt, but a second grand jury issued an indictment for one count of criminal conspiracy on September 28, 2005. On October 3, a third grand jury indicted DeLay for the more serious offense of money laundering.

An arrest warrant was issued on October 19, 2005, and DeLay turned himself in the next day to the Harris County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in Houston. In accordance with House Republican Conference rules, DeLay temporarily resigned from his position as House majority leader. On January 7, 2006, after pressure from fellow Republicans, he announced that he would not seek to return to the post. On June 9, 2006, he resigned from Congress.

After two judges recused themselves, the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court assigned Senior District Judge Pat Priest to preside over the trial.

DeLay moved to dismiss all charges. Judge Priest dismissed one count of the indictment alleging conspiracy to violate election law but allowed the other, more serious charges of money laundering and conspiracy to engage in money laundering to proceed. He also refused to allow a change of venue from Travis County, which the defense argued could not be the site of an impartial trial, to Fort Bend County, in which DeLay resided. The trial began on October 26, 2010, in Austin.

====Conviction====
On November 24, 2010, DeLay was found guilty by a Travis County jury on both counts. The range of possible sentences was probation to between 5 and 99 years in prison and up to $20,000 in fines, though the judge could have chosen probation. On January 10, 2011, after a sentencing hearing, the judge sentenced DeLay to three years in prison on the charge of conspiring to launder corporate money into political donations. On the charge of money laundering, he was sentenced to five years in prison, but that was probated for 10 years, meaning DeLay would serve 10 years&#x27; probation. Dick DeGuerin was DeLay&#x27;s defense attorney.

====Appeal and acquittal====
DeLay appealed his conviction to the Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District at Austin, which heard oral arguments on October 10, 2012. On September 19, 2013, a ruling by the Court of Appeals overturned his convictions and entered an acquittal. Justice Melissa Goodwin wrote in the majority opinion thatRather than supporting an agreement to violate the election code, the evidence shows that the defendants were attempting to comply with the Election Code limitations on corporate contributions. She was joined in the opinion by visiting Justice David Galtney. Chief Justice J. Woodfin Jones dissented, writing, &quot;I disagree with the majority&#x27;s conclusion that there was legally insufficient evidence to support a jury finding that the corporate contributions at issue here were the proceeds of criminal activity.&quot; The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted the prosecution&#x27;s petition for discretionary review on March 19, 2013, agreeing to review the decision of the Texas Court of Appeals Third District.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled, 8-1, to affirm the lower courts&#x27; dismissal on October 1, 2014.

===Contributions from Russian oil executives===
In December 2005, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that, in 1998, a group of Russian oil executives had given money to a nonprofit advocacy group run by a former DeLay staffer and funded by clients of lobbyist Jack Abramoff, in an attempt to influence DeLay&#x27;s vote on an International Monetary Fund bailout of the Russian economy. Associates of DeLay adviser Ed Buckham, the founder of the U.S. Family Network, said that executives from the oil firm Naftasib had offered a donation of $1,000,000 to be delivered to a Washington, D.C.-area airport to secure DeLay&#x27;s support. On June 25, 1998, the U.S. Family Network received a $1 million check via money transferred through the London law firm James &amp; Sarch Co. This payment was the largest single entry on U.S. Family Network&#x27;s donor list. The original source of the donation was not recorded. DeLay denied the payment had influenced his vote. Naftasib denied it had made the payment and that it had ever been represented by James &amp; Sarch Co. The now-dissolved law firm&#x27;s former partners declined to comment due to &quot;confidentiality requirements&quot;. 

===The K Street Project===

DeLay&#x27;s involvement with the lobbying industry included a pointed effort on the part of the Republican Party to parlay the Congressional majority into dominance of K Street, the lobbying district of Washington, D.C. DeLay, Senator Rick Santorum, and Grover Norquist launched a campaign in 1995 encouraging lobbying firms to retain only Republican officials in top positions. Firms that had Democrats in positions of authority, DeLay suggested, would not be granted the ear of majority party members. In 1999, DeLay was privately reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee after he pulled an intellectual property rights bill off the House floor when the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) hired a former Democratic Congressman, Dave McCurdy. Firms initially responded to the campaign, but it waned during 2004, when the possibility of Senator John Kerry&#x27;s winning the presidency gave lobbying firms some incentive to hire Democrats.

===Cuban cigar photo===
DeLay has long been a strong critic of Cuban leader Fidel Castro&#x27;s regime, which DeLay has called a &quot;thugocracy&quot;, and a supporter of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. However, in April 2005, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; published a photo from a government-funded July 2003 trip to Israel, in which DeLay is seen smoking a Cuban cigar. The consumption or purchase of Cuban cigars was illegal in the United States at the time (but was legal for U.S. citizens abroad). In September 2004, the U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s enforcement of the law toughened it to forbid consumption (smoking) or purchase of Cuban cigars by U.S. citizens anywhere in the world, but this ban was partially lifted by President Obama in October 2016.

===Ethics admonishment for misuse of federal agency resources===
During the controversial mid-decade redistricting plan in Texas, several Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives went to Oklahoma to prevent the House from establishing a quorum of members, thereby preventing the House from acting on any legislation, including a proposed redistricting plan. Although not a member of the Texas legislature, DeLay became involved, by contacting several federal agencies in order to determine the location of the missing legislators. DeLay&#x27;s staff contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for assistance in tracking down a plane that one of the legislators was flying to Oklahoma, an action that the FAA believed to be a result of safety concerns about the aircraft. A review by the U.S. Department of Transportation found that a total of thirteen FAA employees spent more than eight hours searching for the airplane.

Members of DeLay&#x27;s staff asked the FBI to arrest the missing Democrats but a Justice Department official dismissed DeLay&#x27;s and his staff&#x27;s request as &quot;wacko&quot;. DeLay also contacted United States Marshal and United States Attorney&#x27;s offices in Texas, as well as the Air and Marine Interdiction Coordination Center, an agency that deals with smuggling and terrorism. U.S. senator Joseph Lieberman (I-Connecticut) requested an investigation into DeLay&#x27;s involvement in the requests, and asked that any White House involvement be reported. The House Ethics Committee admonished DeLay for improper use of FAA resources, and for involving federal agencies in a matter that should have been resolved by Texas authorities.

===Civil lawsuit===
In early 1999, &quot;The New Republic&quot; picked up a story, first reported by Houston-area alternative weeklies, alleging that DeLay had committed perjury during a civil lawsuit brought against him by a former business partner in 1994.

The plaintiff in that suit, Robert Blankenship, charged that DeLay and a third partner in Albo Pest Control had breached the partnership agreement by trying to force him out of the business without buying him out. Blankenship filed suit, charging DeLay and the other partner with breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, wrongful termination, and loss of corporate expectancy. While being deposed in that suit, DeLay claimed that he did not think that he was an officer or director of Albo and that he believed that he had resigned two or three years previously. However, his congressional disclosure forms, including one filed subsequent to the deposition, stated that he was either president or chairman of the company between 1985 and 1994. Blankenship also alleged that Albo money had been spent on DeLay&#x27;s congressional campaigns, in violation of federal and state law. DeLay and Blankenship settled for an undisclosed sum. Blankenship&#x27;s attorney said that had he known about the congressional disclosure forms, he would have referred the case to the Harris County district attorney&#x27;s office for a perjury prosecution.

===Jack Abramoff scandal===

DeLay was the target of the Justice Department investigation into Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff&#x27;s actions. Abramoff allegedly provided DeLay with trips, gifts, and political donations in exchange for favors to Abramoff&#x27;s lobbying clients, which included the government of the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Internet gambling services, and several Native American tribes. Two of DeLay&#x27;s former political aides, Tony Rudy and Michael Scanlon, as well as Abramoff himself, pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges relating to the investigation. Political columnist Robert Novak reported that Abramoff &quot;has no derogatory information about former House majority leader Tom DeLay and is not implicating him as part of his plea bargain with federal prosecutors.&quot;

According to ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; television program and NPR, Abramoff lobbied DeLay to stop legislation banning sex shops and sweatshops that forced employees to have abortions in the Northern Mariana Islands when Abramoff accompanied DeLay on a 1997 trip to the U.S. commonwealth. While on the trip, DeLay promised not to put the bill on the legislative calendar.

In 2000, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a worker reform bill to extend the protection of U.S. labor and minimum-wage laws to the workers in the Northern Mariana Islands. DeLay, the House Republican Whip, stopped the House from considering the bill. DeLay later blocked a fact-finding mission planned by Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-MI) by threatening him with the loss of his subcommittee chairmanship.

DeLay received gifts from Abramoff, including paid golfing holidays to Scotland, concert tickets, and the use of Abramoff&#x27;s private skyboxes for fundraisers. In May 2000, ARMPAC received the free use of one of Abramoff&#x27;s private skyboxes to host a political fundraiser. At the time, campaign finance laws did not require the use of the skybox, valued at several thousand dollars, to be disclosed or for Abramoff to be reimbursed for its use.

Later that month, the DeLays, Rudy, another aide, and Abramoff took a trip to London and Scotland. Abramoff paid for the airfare for the trip, and lobbyist Ed Buckham paid for expenses at a hotel at St. Andrews golf course in Scotland. Abramoff was reimbursed by The National Center for Public Policy Research, the nonprofit organization that arranged the trip. On the day that the trip began, The National Center received large donations from two of Abramoff&#x27;s clients, internet lottery service eLottery, Inc., and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Both organizations denied that they had intended to pay for DeLay&#x27;s trip.

House rules forbid members to accept travel expenses from lobbyists, and require that members inquire into the sources of funds that nonprofits use to pay for trips. DeLay denied knowing that lobbyists had paid for travel expenses. In July 2000, DeLay voted against a bill that would have restricted Internet gambling. Both eLottery and the Choctaws opposed the bill. Rudy, who was then DeLay&#x27;s deputy chief of staff, doomed the bill by engineering a parliamentary maneuver that required a two-thirds majority vote, rather than a simple majority, for the bill to pass. Rudy&#x27;s actions on behalf of Abramoff&#x27;s clients during this time were mentioned in Abramoff&#x27;s guilty plea in January 2006.

In January 2006, The Associated Press reported that in 2001, DeLay co-signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft calling for the closure of a casino owned by the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. Two weeks earlier, the Choctaws had donated $1,000 to DeLay&#x27;s Texans for a Republican Majority PAC (TRMPAC). A DeLay spokesman denied that the donations had influenced DeLay&#x27;s actions. Currently, and at the time of the letter, casinos or other private gambling establishments are illegal in Texas, even on Indian reservations.

Scanlon, who became Abramoff&#x27;s lobbying partner, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to conspiracy charges. Abramoff pleaded guilty to fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy charges on January 3, 2006, and agreed to cooperate with the government&#x27;s investigation. His cooperation may have forced DeLay to abandon his efforts to return to his position as House majority leader, a decision DeLay announced only a few days after Abramoff&#x27;s plea bargain. Rudy pleaded guilty on March 31, 2006, to illegally acting on Abramoff&#x27;s behalf in exchange for gifts. Abramoff referred clients to Ed Buckham&#x27;s Alexander Strategy Group (ASG), a lobbying firm. In addition, Abramoff clients gave more than $1.5 million to Buckham&#x27;s U.S. Family Network, which then paid ASG more than $1 million.

From 1998–2002, ASG paid Christine DeLay (Tom DeLay&#x27;s wife) a monthly salary averaging between $3,200 and $3,400. DeLay&#x27;s attorney, Richard Cullen, initially said the payments were for telephone calls she made periodically to the offices of certain members of Congress seeking the names of their favorite charities, and that she then forwarded that information to Buckham, along with some information about those charities. In early June 2006, Cullen said the payments were also for general political consulting she provided to her husband. In all, Christine DeLay was paid about $115,000 directly by ASG, and got another $25,000 via money put into a retirement account by the firm. Her work with ASG has been the subject of an inquiry by the Department of Justice.

In August 2010, the government ended a six-year investigation of his ties to Abramoff, according to DeLay&#x27;s lead counsel in the matter, Richard Cullen. A state case continued in Texas.

==Political positions==

===Domestic policy===
On economic policy, DeLay was rated 95 out of 100 by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative anti-tax group, and 95 to 100 by the United States Chamber of Commerce, a pro-business lobby. He received the lowest possible score of 0% from the AFL–CIO, the nation&#x27;s largest organization of labor unions.

On environmental policy, he earned ratings of zero from the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters. He has been a fervent critic of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which he has called the &quot;Gestapo of government&quot;.

In the politics of guns, DeLay firmly came down on the side of gun owners rights, loosening gun control laws and opposing stricter controls. He received a grade of &quot;A+&quot; from the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), the nation&#x27;s largest pro-gun rights lobby.

The American Civil Liberties Union measured that his voting history aligned with their civil liberties platform 0% of the time.

On the issue of immigration, DeLay received the highest possible score of 100% from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an organization that seeks to restrict immigration.

DeLay opposed abortion rights. In 2005, he voted 100% in line with the views of the National Right to Life Committee and 0% with the National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League.

DeLay opposes the teaching of evolution. After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, he entered into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; a statement saying that shootings happened in part &quot;because our school systems teach our children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud.&quot;

In 2001, DeLay refused to increase the Earned Income Credit (EIC) tax credit, thereby defying President George W. Bush, during the congressional battle over Bush&#x27;s tax cuts for people making between $10,500 and $26,625 a year; when reporters asked DeLay about what he would do about increasing the EIC, DeLay simply stated, &quot;[It] ain&#x27;t going to happen.&quot; When Bush&#x27;s press secretary Ari Fleischer reiterated the president&#x27;s desire for a low-income tax cut, DeLay retorted, &quot;The last time I checked they [the executive branch] don&#x27;t have a vote.&quot;

In 2003, DeLay blamed Senate Democrats and what he called &quot;BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything) environmentalists&quot; for blocking legislative solutions to problems such as the 2003 North America blackout.

DeLay maintained public silence on Houston&#x27;s 2003 METRORail light rail initiative, though in the past, he had opposed expanding light rail to Houston. Public filings later showed that DeLay had his Americans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (ARMPAC) and his congressional campaign committee sent money to Texans for True Mobility, an organization that advocated against the initiative. The proposal passed by a slim margin. Despite his earlier opposition, following the passage of the initiative, DeLay helped to obtain funding for the light rail program.

In 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay for his actions related to a 2002 energy bill. A Committee memo stated that DeLay &quot;created the appearance that donors were being provided with special access to Representative DeLay regarding the then-pending energy legislation.&quot;

In 2005, DeLay, acting against the president&#x27;s wishes, initiated the &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision for MTBE in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, together with Rep. Joe Barton.

DeLay supported the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. Critics of the legislation argued that it unduly favored creditors over consumers, noting that the credit card industry spent millions of dollars lobbying in support of the act. The bill passed Congress.

====Terri Schiavo====

DeLay called the Terri Schiavo case &quot;one of my proudest moments in Congress&quot;. DeLay made headlines for his role in helping lead federal intervention in the matter. On Palm Sunday weekend in March 2005, several days after the brain-damaged Florida woman&#x27;s feeding tube was disconnected for the third time, the House met in emergency session to pass a bill allowing Schiavo&#x27;s parents to petition a federal judge to review the removal of the feeding tube. DeLay called the removal of the feeding tube &quot;an act of barbarism&quot;. DeLay faced accusations of hypocrisy from critics when the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; revealed that he had consented to ending life support for his father, who had been in a comatose state because of a debilitating accident in 1988.

DeLay was accused of endorsing violence in the wake of a series of high-profile violent crimes and death threats against judges when he said, &quot;The men responsible [for Terri Schiavo&#x27;s death] will have to answer to their behavior&quot;. DeLay&#x27;s comments came soon after the February 28, 2005, homicide of the mother and husband of Chicago Judge Joan Lefkow, and the March 11, 2005, killing of Atlanta Judge Rowland Barnes. DeLay&#x27;s opponents accused him of rationalizing violence against judges when their decisions were unpopular with the public. Ralph Neas, President of People for the American Way, said that DeLay&#x27;s comments were &quot;irresponsible and could be seen by some as justifying inexcusable conduct against our courts&quot;.

===Foreign policy===
DeLay has been a strong supporter of the State of Israel, saying, &quot;The Republican leadership, especially that leadership in the House, has made pro-Israel policy a fundamental component of our foreign policy agenda and it drives the Democrat leadership crazy—because they just can&#x27;t figure out why we do it!&quot; In a 2002 speech, DeLay promised to &quot;use every tool at my disposal to ensure that the Republican Conference, and the House of Representatives, continues to preserve and strengthen America&#x27;s alliance with the State of Israel.&quot;

On a 2003 trip to Israel, DeLay toured the nation and addressed members of the Knesset. His opposition to land concessions is so strong that Aryeh Eldad, the deputy of Israel&#x27;s conservative National Union party, remarked, &quot;As I shook his hand, I told Tom DeLay that until I heard him speak, I thought I was farthest to the right in the Knesset.&quot; Former Mossad chief Danny Yatom said &quot;The Likud is nothing compared to this guy.&quot;

In 2005, in a snub to the Bush administration, DeLay was the &quot;driving force behind the rejection of direct aid&quot; to the Palestinian Authority. The deal had been brokered by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. In the wake of the legislation, some Jewish leaders expressed concern &quot;about the degree to which the Texas Republican, an evangelical Christian who opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, will go to undercut American and Israeli attempts to achieve a two-state solution.&quot;

==Electoral history==
===Investigation of Texas fundraising===
===2006 campaign===
==Life after Congress==
Since leaving Congress, along with tending to his legal troubles, DeLay has co-authored (with Stephen Mansfield) a political memoir, &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender: One American&#x27;s Fight&quot;, given media interviews (primarily regarding politics), begun a personal blog, opened an official Facebook page (written in the third-person), become active on Twitter (written in the first-person), and appeared on the ninth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, the highly watched ABC television reality show.

DeLay ascribes divine motivation to his political efforts since leaving Congress, telling an interviewer: &quot;I listen to God, and what I&#x27;ve heard is that I&#x27;m supposed to devote myself to rebuilding the conservative base of the Republican Party, and I think we shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated.&quot;

DeLay&#x27;s website concludes by saying that the former congressman and his wife &quot;continue to be outspoken advocates for foster care reform and are actively involved in a unique foster care community in Richmond, Texas, that provides safe, permanent homes for abused and neglected kids.&quot; Rio Bend, a &quot;Christ-centered&quot; community which the DeLays founded, opened in 2005.

===Blog and book===
On December 10, 2006, DeLay launched a personal blog. After joining &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in August 2008, DeLay scrubbed his personal website of most of its political content and rebranded it as &quot;Dancing with DeLay.&quot;

In March 2007, DeLay published &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender: One American&#x27;s Fight&quot;, co-authored with Stephen Mansfield. The book&#x27;s foreword is by Rush Limbaugh; the preface, by Sean Hannity. The book contains controversial claims, including DeLay&#x27;s assertion as fact the claim that the Clinton Administration had sought to have military uniforms banned from the White House, which has been repeatedly proven false.

===&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===
DeLay was a participant on the ninth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, a reality-TV dance competition show in which celebrities such as DeLay are paired with professional dancers. DeLay&#x27;s dance partner-instructor was Cheryl Burke, a two-time champion on the highly watched ABC television show. DeLay is the second former politician to compete on the show, following the former mayor of Cincinnati (1977–78), season three&#x27;s Jerry Springer, better known as host of the tabloid television talk show &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;.

===Discussion of &quot;birther&quot; conspiracy theory===

On August 19, 2009, DeLay, making the rounds of various media shows in order to promote his upcoming participation in season nine of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, was interviewed by Chris Matthews of &quot;Hardball&quot;, a political news and talk show on MSNBC. DeLay made political news, when, during the interview, he became the most famous Republican yet to give voice to the so-called birther conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama. During his appearance on &quot;Hardball&quot;, when pressed by Matthews as to whether he supported the conspiracy theory and its adherents and proponents, including several Republican members of Congress, DeLay said, &quot;I would like the president to produce his birth certificate... I can, most illegal aliens here in America can. Why can&#x27;t the president of the United States produce a birth certificate?... Chris, the Constitution of the United States specifically says you have to be a &#x27;natural-born citizen&#x27; [to be eligible to serve as president].&quot;

== Personal life ==
DeLay married Christine Furrh, whom he had known since high school, in 1967. In 1972, the DeLays had a daughter, Danielle, who became a public school math teacher.

During his time in the Texas Legislature, DeLay struggled with alcoholism and gained a reputation as a playboy, earning the nickname &quot;Hot Tub Tom&quot;. By the time of his election to Congress in 1984 he was drinking &quot;eight, ten, twelve martinis a night at receptions and fundraisers.&quot; In 1985 DeLay became a born-again Christian, and gave up hard liquor. Of the Rev. Ken Wilde, an evangelical minister from Idaho who founded the National Prayer Center in Washington, D.C., which houses volunteers who come to the capital to pray for the nation&#x27;s leaders, DeLay said, &quot;This is the man who really saved me. When I was going through my troubles, it was Ken who really stepped up.&quot; Of his conversion, he said, &quot;I had put my needs first ... I was on the throne, not God. I had pushed God from His throne.&quot;

In criticizing Newt Gingrich for secretly having an affair with a staffer while Gingrich, as House Speaker, was simultaneously impeaching President Bill Clinton for lying under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, DeLay said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that Newt could set a high moral standard, a high moral tone, during that moment... You can&#x27;t do that if you&#x27;re keeping secrets about your own adulterous affairs&quot;.

Differentiating between Gingrich&#x27;s adultery and his own admitted adultery, DeLay said, &quot;I was no longer committing adultery by that time, the impeachment trial. There&#x27;s a big difference. ... I had returned to Christ and repented my sins by that time.&quot;

DeLay declined to comment on a 1999 report in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that he was estranged from much of his family, including his mother and one of his brothers. As of 2001, he had not spoken to his younger brother, Randy, a Houston lobbyist, since 1996, when a complaint to the House Ethics Committee prompted DeLay to state that he had cut his brother off in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.
