<text>More than 500 women were killed between 1993 and 2011 in Ciudad Juárez, a city in northern Mexico. The murders of women and girls received international attention primarily due to perceived government inaction in preventing the violence and bringing perpetrators to justice. A &quot;narcofosa&quot; (mass grave attributed to organized crime) containing the remains of women killed in 2011 and 2012 was found in Madera Municipality, Chihuahua, in December 2016.

==Homicide statistics==
In 2005 Amnesty International said that more than 370 young women and girls had been killed in the cities of Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua since 1993. In August 2011, it was reported that 130 killings occurred in Ciudad Juárez since January of that year.

A study was conducted in 2008 on the Femicide Database 1993–2007 at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte which documented incidents of femicide that occurred in Ciudad Juárez from 1993 to 2010. Of the various different kinds of murders that were analyzed, the study found two common patterns in the data which were classified as intimate femicide and systemic sexual femicide. Intimate femicide refers to women who were killed by men that were close to them.

According to the study, intimate femicide accounted for 30.4% of the murders of women and girls in Juárez from 1993 to 2007. Systematic sexual femicide refers to systematic patterns in the killing of women and children including kidnapping, sexual violence, torture, and body abandonment in areas such as desert areas, garbage dumps, and sewage ditches among others.

According to Molly Molloy, a former librarian at New Mexico State University, the situation in Juárez is one of &quot;impunity regardless of gender&quot;. She states that &quot;female murder victims have never comprised more than 18 percent of the overall number of murder victims in Ciudad Juárez, and in the last two decades that figure averages at less than 10 percent. That&#x27;s less than in the United States, where about 20 to 25 percent of the people who are murdered in a given year are women&quot;.

Statistical evaluation of data from 1990 to 2012 conducted by researchers Pedro Albuquerque and Prasad Vemala shows that femicide rates in Juárez are in most years like rates in Chihuahua City and Ensenada and, as a share of overall homicide rates, are lower than in most cities evaluated.

==Contributing factors==

===Organized crime and drug trafficking===
Drug cartels operate in Juárez, which has resulted in high levels of violence against the local population, including women and girls. Misogyny is a common trait of gang activity. According to a study conducted in 2008, 9.1% of the murders of women were attributed to organized crime and drug trafficking activities.

===Maquila industry===
Maquiladoras are widely known for their cheap labor and their exploitative conditions, such as regularly violating basic human rights, that often target women. Women and girls often migrate from villages or rural areas in other parts of Mexico in search of work in the maquilas. According to Livingston, this migration of women created, &quot;a new phenomenon of mobile, independent, and vulnerable working women,&quot; in cities like Ciudad Juárez. Many of the murder victims in Ciudad Juárez have been maquiladora employees. Despite the expansion of the maquila industry, Juárez still remained a relatively poor and undeveloped city lacking infrastructure in some parts such as electricity and paved roads. As a part of their daily commute, many women maquila workers walk through such areas to and from company buses creating vulnerability to be victimized. In addition, the increased involvement of women in the labor force may also be a contributing factor to the victimization of women and girls because of the competition for economic resources in decades in which male unemployment has been high.

===NAFTA===
The implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 resulted in the expansion of the maquiladora industry and created new opportunities for employment for women outside of the home and in the factories. The availability of cheap labor made it attractive for business owners to open factories in Mexico, and the availability of cheap employment attracted many, especially women, to border towns such as Ciudad Juárez. Research has shown correlations between economic and political issues and violence against women along the border.

Academic Katherine Pantaleo has argued that &quot;NAFTA, as a capitalist approach, has directly created a devaluation of women and an increase in gendered violence.&quot; Further, according to Wright, in the time period between the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 and 2001, &quot;the homicide rate for men increased by 300 percent, while for women it increased by 600 percent.&quot; Such studies indicate the importance of exploring the effects of NAFTA when considering the possible causes of the murder of women and girls in Ciudad Juárez. Consequently, it has been suggested that amendments be made to NAFTA that include human rights provisions.

===Gender roles===
Sociocultural attitudes to traditional gender roles have influenced violence against women. According to Pantaleo, &quot;Under the view of patriarchy, two expressions are commonly used in Mexico to show the difference in the status of males and females; these expressions are machismo and marianismo.&quot; Machismo is characterized by male power and aggression; while marianismo is characterized by subordination and domestic duties. Women who leave their homes to seek employment in the maquila industry directly challenge the marianismo. Olivera suggests that this changed situation challenges hypermasculinity. According to Livingston, gender-directed violence in Ciudad Juárez may be a negative reaction as women &quot;gain greater personal autonomy and independence while men lose ground.&quot;

== Police and governmental response ==
The murder of women in Juárez has attracted global attention since 1993 given suspected police and government inaction to prevent the murders and bring perpetrators to justice. Police and government officials have been accused of responding with indifference to the crimes against women as well as exhibiting tolerance for such crimes, conducting inadequate and negligent investigations, ineffectively responding to the crimes, and failing to prevent and protect women from violence. According to Livingston, &quot;In 1998 the National Commission for Human Rights issued a report charging gross irregularities and general negligence in state investigations, including the misidentification of corpses, failure to obtain expert tests on forensic evidence, failure to conduct autopsies or obtain semen analysis... failure to file written reports, [and] incompetence in keeping records of the rising tide of women murders.&quot;

As a result of international attention, police and government officials have been politically pressured to respond to the murders. In 2011, Amnesty International said, &quot;The government [has] failed to take effective measures to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for the abduction and killing of three women in Ciudad Juárez... or to combat the ongoing pattern of violence against women and discrimination in the city.

===Convictions===
According to Pantaleo in 2006, &quot;While around 400 girls and women have been abducted and murdered, few arrests and convictions have resulted.&quot; For convictions that have been made, there is a great deal of controversy that surrounds them. Police have been accused of conducting rushed investigations with questionable methodology and integrity. Further, suspects that have been apprehended have claimed that they were tortured into confessing. This has caused uncertainty of the legitimacy of both investigations and convictions.

In 1996, an Egyptian, Abdul Latif Sharif, was convicted of 3 murders and sentenced to a 30-year prison term. After his arrest in 1995, the murders continued and authorities claimed that Sharif directed members of the &quot;Los Rebeldes&quot; gang to continue the murders while he was incarcerated. These members were indicted and convicted as a result of this connection. The gang members accused of carrying out murders under Sharif&#x27;s orders claimed they were tortured while in police custody. According to Monarrez Fragoso, &quot;In the year 2000, it was known that the body of Elizabeth Castro Garcia, whose murder was attributed to Omar Sharif Latif, does not belong to her.&quot;

In 2001, Victor Garcia Uribe and Gustavo Gonzalez Meza were apprehended for eight murders. Gustavo Gonzalez Mesa died suspiciously while in police custody. In 2004, Victor Garcia Uribe, a bus driver, was convicted of eight murders that took place in 2001. He confessed to these murders, but claimed that he was tortured into confessing by police. On 15 July 2005, García Uribe was freed, this due the lack of evidence about his participation in the murders.

In 2008, 16-year-old Ruby Frayre Escobedo was murdered by Sergio Barraza Bocanegra who was acquitted at his first trial for lack of evidence. Following two years of activism, a retrial convicted Bocanegra, who remained on the run. In 2010, Ruby&#x27;s mother, Marisela Escobedo Ortiz, was assassinated by a shot to the head at point blank range while demonstrating for justice in front of the Governor&#x27;s Palace in Chihuahua.

==International justice==
There have been several international rulings against Mexico for its inadequate response to the increasing violence against women. In 2004, under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) conducted an inquiry into the allegations that hundreds of murders of women and girls had taken place in the area of Ciudad Juarez since 1993 at the urging of several NGOs. In order for the inquiry to take place it was required that there was reliable evidence that showed that Mexico was in violation of rights established by CEDAW. The Committee analyzed the gender-based crimes occurring in Ciudad Juárez and found the two common forms were murder and disappearances. The committee also analyzed the response of the government and found that their initial response was indifference and that the government exhibited tolerance of these crimes for years.

Further, the Committee concluded that the measures undertaken by the Mexican government in response to gendered violence against women leading up to the time of their inquiry were, &quot;few and ineffective at all levels of the State&quot;. The committee made several recommendations for Mexico to adhere to. Although these recommendations were not legally binding, they were influential in the public sphere.

According to Amnesty International, &quot;In [2009], the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled on the &quot;cotton field&quot; (Campo Algodonero) case that Mexico was guilty of discrimination and of failing to protect three young women murdered in 2001 in Ciudad Juárez or to ensure an effective investigation into their abduction and murder.&quot; The Court ordered Mexico to conduct a new investigation of the murders, create a national memorial for the victims, pay reparations to the families of the victims, and to improve measures which prevent and adequately investigate the murder of women and girls.

==Local activism==

There have been numerous local efforts that have helped draw attention to the femicides in Juárez. In 1999, a group of feminist activists founded Casa Amiga, Juárez&#x27;s first rape crisis and sexual assault center. The center works to provide women in Juárez with a refuge against violence, therapy, legal council, and medical attention. In 2002, a social justice movement named Ni Una Mas, which in Spanish means &quot;not one more,&quot; was formed to raise international awareness to violence against women in Juárez. The movement consists of a variety of domestic and international organizations and individual activists.

Ni Una Mas participants demand that the Mexican state implement strategies that prevent violence against women including murder and kidnappings and that the state conduct competent investigations on crimes already committed. Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C., which in Spanish means &quot;Our Daughters Back Home&quot; also formed in response to the violence against women in Juárez. Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C. has also worked to bring domestic and international media attention to the violence against women in Juárez.

<text>A piece of postal stationery is a stationery item, such as a stamped envelope, letter sheet, postal card, lettercard, aerogram or wrapper, with an imprinted stamp or inscription indicating that a specific rate of postage or related service has been prepaid. It does &quot;not&quot;, however, include any postcard without a pre-printed stamp, and it is different from freepost for preprinted cards issued by businesses. In general, postal stationery is handled similarly to postage stamps; sold from post offices either at the face value of the printed postage or, more likely, with a surcharge to cover the additional cost of the stationery. It can take the form of an official mail issue produced only for the use of government departments.

== History ==

Postal stationery has been in use since at least 1608 with folded letters bearing the coat of arms Venice. Other early examples include British newspaper stamps that were first issued in 1712, 25-centime letter sheets that were issued in 1790 by the government of Luxembourg, and Australian postal stationery that predated more well known issues like the British Mulready stationery that was introduced in 1840.

The first modern form of postal stationery was the stamped, or postal stationery, envelope created by the United Kingdom around 1841.. Other countries quickly followed suite, including the United States, which released the Nesbitt series of stamped envelopes in 1853. A variation of the stamped envelope, a registered envelope, has been widely used throughout Great Britain and the British Commonwealth. Although none have been issued in the United States due to differences in mail registration procedures. Another form of stamped envelopes are so called wrappers, a form of postal stationery envelope that can be used to prepay the cost of delivery for a newspaper or periodical. Wrappers were first introduced in 1961 by the United States, which was followed by 110 other countries in total. Although all the countries have stopped producing then due to declining sales. With Cyprus being the last country to stop their use in 1991.

The next innovation in postal stationery came in 1869 with the introduction of the postal card in Austria-Hungry. Postal cards are a type of cardstock that contains an imprinted stamp or indicium. They quickly caught on due to being mostly uniform and less bulky then traditional letters. To the point that Great Britain, Finland, Switzerland and Württemberg had all issued postal cards by 1871. Followed by the United States in 1873.

Despite its popularity, the postal card was soon followed by the letter card. A letter card is a postal stationery item consisting of a folded card with a prepaid imprinted stamp. The format was first issued by Belgium in 1882. Great Britain issued their first official letter cards in 1892 and Newfoundland introduced small reply cards starting in 1912. Letter cards had the advantage of providing twice the room for writing a message then postal cards and were more private due to being folded over.. A variation of the letter card called an aerogram was introduced in 1933 by a Lieutenant Colonel while he was doing a tour in the Middle East theatre. Although the format was not officially endorsed by the Universal Postal Union until 1952. An aerogram is a thin, lightweight piece foldable paper that is used for writing letters and sending them via airmail. Although unlike letter cards they can come unstamped and be issued by private companies..

== Collecting ==
Most postal stationery pieces are collected as entires, that is, the whole card, sheet, or envelope. In the 19th century, it was common to collect &quot;cut squares&quot; (or &quot;cut-outs&quot; in the UK), which involved clipping the embossed or otherwise pre-printed indicia from postal stationery entires. This destroyed the envelope. As a result, one cannot tell from a cut square what specific envelope it came from and, many times, the cancellation information. The manner in which the stamped envelope is cut out (defined by the term &quot;knife&quot;) cannot be determined from a cut square. Thus, most collectors prefer entires to cut squares.

Many country-specific stamp catalogs list postal stationery and there are books devoted to the postal stationery of individual countries. The current, but now dated, principal encyclopedic work is the nineteen volume Higgins &amp; Gage World Postal Stationery Catalog.

<doc id="216594" wikidata="Q768506" url="?curid=216594" title="Söğüt">
<text>Söğüt (, ) is a town in Bilecik Province, Turkey. It is the seat of Söğüt District. Its population is 13,566 (2021). The mayor is İsmet Sever (MHP), elected in 2019.

Söğüt is notable as the founding location and first capital of the Ottoman Empire from 1281 to 1335.

== Name and etymology ==
The name of the settlement is first attested under the Greek name &quot;Thēbásion&quot; () in 13th century. According to Ottoman cadastral record books of 1487 in Hüdavendigâr area the town was registered under the Turkish name &quot;Beğsöğüdü&quot; or &quot;Bey Söğüdü&quot;, and this name took the form &quot;Söğüd&quot; in government records after the first half of the 17th century.

A Greek rendering of the Turkish name, &quot;Sogoúti&quot; (), is attested in late Byzantine sources. Laonikos Chalkokondyles also wrote that &quot;Itéas Kómi&quot; (Ἰταίας Κώμη) was an older Greek name for Söğüt, but since Greek &quot;itéa&quot; (Ιταία) and Turkish &quot;söğüt&quot; both mean &quot;willow&quot;, Klaus Belke considers this &quot;more of a learned translation&quot; than a genuine older name for the town.

==History==

The town was originally known under the name Thêbásion and lay on a strategically important road between Nicaea and Dorylaion that was part of the Pilgrim&#x27;s Road. It was conquered by Ertuğrul for the Anatolian Seljuks from the Nicean Empire in 1231. Ertuğrul and his tribe (allegedly part of the Kayi tribe/branch of the Oghuz Turks who invaded Anatolia in the 12th and 13th centuries) migrated and settled there during the Mongol invasion after the Battle of Köse Dağ. Ertuğrul ruled from here until his death and also made a mosque for the Muslims living there, including a well which could be used for Ablution. The mosque is still located in there as Ertuğrul Gazi Mosque. As the Rum Seljuk state collapsed, Söğüt became the centre of the Beylik of the Osmanoğulları or Osmanlı Beylik (which later expanded to become the Ottoman Empire). Söğüt was the birthplace of Osman I who continued the raids and conquests into Byzantine territory during his reign from 1299 to 1324. When Osman&#x27;s son, Orhan, came to power after his father&#x27;s death, he renamed the Kayi tribe Osmanli in honour of his father. 

The village of Thebasion until 1231 served during this time as the capital of the Osmanlı Beylik until the capture of the Byzantine city of Proussa (Bursa) in 1326 that succeeded it as the administrative centre of the Beylik. Söğüt, as the place became known, had a kaza centre in the Ertuğrul Sanjak of Hüdavendigâr Vilayet, the centre of which was Bilecik. The kaza centre included present-day districts of İnhisar, İnönü, Mihalgazi, Sarıcakaya and Yenipazar, central and eastern parts of Bozüyük and some villages of Nallıhan and Tepebaşı before World War I. 

=== Modern era ===
Söğüt was occupied three times by the Greek Army during the Turkish War of Independence: 8–11 January 1921, 24 March-21 April 1921 and 12 July 1921 – 6 September 1922.

Today Söğüt is a small town in the humid river valley of Bilecik Province in Turkey. Turkish history and life-size statues of the Ottoman sultans are exhibited in the Söğüt Ethnographical Museum. It is also the 3rd biggest district center in its province after Bozüyük and Bilecik.

<doc id="216597" wikidata="Q137111" url="?curid=216597" title="Chishti Order">
<text>The Chishti order () is a Sufi order of Sunni Islam named after the town of Chisht, Afghanistan where it was initiated by Abu Ishaq Shami. The order was brought to Herat and later spread across South Asia by Mu&#x27;in al-Din Chishti in the city of Ajmer. 

The Chishti Order is known for its emphasis on love, tolerance, and openness. The Chishti order is primarily followed in Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent. The Chishti order was the first of the four main Sufi orders that became well-established in South Asia, which are the Qadiri, Chishti, Naqshbandi and Suhrawardi Sufi orders. Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti introduced the Chishti Order in Ajmer (Rajasthan, India) sometime in the middle of the 12th century. He was eighth in the line of succession from the founder of the Chishti Order, Abu Ishaq Shami. There are now several branches of the order, which has been the most prominent South Asian Sufi brotherhood since the 12th century.

In the 20th century, the order has spread outside Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent. Chishti teachers have established centers in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, Eastern and Southern Africa.

==Guiding principles==
The Chishti shaykhs have stressed the importance of keeping a distance from worldly power. A ruler could be a patron or a disciple, but he or she was always to be treated as just another devotee. A Chishti teacher should not attend the court or be involved in matters of state, as this will corrupt the soul with worldly matters. In his last discourse to his slaves Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti said:

Chishti practice is also notable for &quot;Sama&quot;: evoking the divine presence by listening to and losing oneself in a form of music and poetry, usually Qawwali. The Chishti, and some other Sufi orders, believe that Sama can help devotees forget self in the love of Allah. However, the order also insists that followers observe the full range of Muslim obligations; it does not dismiss them as mere legalism, as some strands of Sufism have done.

However some Qadiris point out that the Chishti Order and Moinuddin Chishti never permitted musical instruments, and cite a Chishti, Muhammad Ibn Mubarak Kirmani, the Mureed of Khwaja Fareed al-Deen Ganj-e-Shakar, who wrote in his Siyar al-Awliya that Nizamuddin Auliya said the following:

However, this has been countered by the more historical excerpt of Nizamuddin Auliya&#x27;s quotation:

== Practices ==
The Chishtis follow five basic devotional practices (dhikr).

# Reciting the names of Allāh loudly, sitting in the prescribed posture at prescribed times (&quot;dhikr-i jali&quot;)
# Reciting the names of Allāh silently (&quot;dhikr-i khafī&quot;)
# Regulating the breath (&quot;pās-i anfās&quot;)
# Absorption in meditation on the Divine (&quot;murā-ḳāba&quot;)
# Forty days or more days of spiritual confinement in a lonely corner or cell for prayer and contemplation (&quot;čilla&quot;)

==Literature==
Early Chishti shaykhs adopted concepts and doctrines outlined in two influential Sufi texts: the &quot;ʿAwārif al-Maʿārif&quot; of Shaykh Shihāb al-Dīn Suhrawardī and the &quot;Kashf al-Maḥjūb&quot; of Ali Hujwīrī. These texts are still read and respected today. Chishtis also read collections of the sayings, speeches, poems, and letters of the shaykhs. These collections, called &quot;malfūẓāt&quot;, were prepared by the shaykh&#x27;s disciples.

==Spiritual lineage==

Sufi orders trace their origins ultimately to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who is believed to have instructed his successor in mystical teachings and practices in addition to the Qur&#x27;an or hidden within the Qur&#x27;an. Opinions differ as to this successor. Almost all Sufi orders trace their origins to &#x27;Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, Muhammad&#x27;s cousin.

The traditional silsila (spiritual lineage) of the Chishti order is as follows:

#Muḥammad
#Ali ibn Abu Talib
#Al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī (d. 728, an early Persian Muslim theologian)
#&#x27;Abdul Wāḥid ibn Zaid Abul Faḍl (d. 793, an early Sufi saint)
#Fuḍayl ibn &#x27;Iyāḍ ibn Mas&#x27;ūd ibn Bishr al-Tamīmī
#Ibrāhīm ibn Adham (a legendary early Sufi ascetic)
#Khwaja Sadid ad-Din Huzaifa al-Marashi Basra Iraq
#Abu Hubayra al-Basri Basra Iraq
#Khwaja Mumshad Uluw Al Dīnawarī
#Abu Ishaq Shamī (d. 940, founder of the Chishti order proper)
#Abu Aḥmad Abdal Chishti
#Abu Muḥammad Chishti
#Abu Yusuf Nasar-ud-Din Chishtī
#Qutab-ud-Din Maudood Chishtī
#Haji Sharif Zindani (d. 1215)
#Usman Harooni (d. 1220)
#Mu&#x27;īnuddīn Chishtī (Moinuddin Chishti) (1141–1230 or 1142–1236)
#Qutab-ud-Din Bakhtyar Kaki (1173–1228)
#Farīduddīn Mas&#x27;ūd (&quot;Baba Farid&quot;, 1173 or 1175–1266)

After Farīduddīn Mas&#x27;ūd, the Chishti order divided into two branches:

*Chishtī Sabri, who follow Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari (Sabiri/Sabriya branch)
*Chishtī Nizami who follow Nizāmuddīn Auliyā (Nizami/Nizamiya branch)

==History==

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; divides Chishti history into four periods:
* Era of the great shaykhs (/1200 to 757/1356)
* Era of the provincial khānaḳāhs (8th/14th &amp; 9th/15th centuries)
* Rise of the Ṣābiriyya branch (9th/15th century onwards)
* Revival of the Niẓāmiyya branch (12th/18th century onwards)

The order was founded by Abu Ishaq Shami (&quot;the Syrian&quot;) who taught Sufism in the town of Chisht, some 95 miles east of Herat in present-day western Afghanistan. Before returning to Syria, where he is now buried next to Ibn Arabi at Jabal Qasioun, Shami initiated, trained and deputized the son of the local emir, Abu Ahmad Abdal. Under the leadership of Abu Ahmad&#x27;s descendants, the &quot;Chishtiya&quot;, as they are also known, flourished as a regional mystical order.

The founder of the Chishti Order in South Asia was Moinuddin Chishti. He was born in the province of Silistan in eastern Persia around 536 AH (1141 CE) into a sayyid family claiming descent from Muhammad. When he was just nine, he memorized the Qur&#x27;an, thus becoming a hafiz. His father died when he was a teenager; Moinuddin inherited the family grinding mill and orchard. He sold everything and gave the proceeds to the poor. He traveled to Balkh and Samarkand, where he studied the Qur&#x27;an, hadith, and fiqh. He looked for something beyond scholarship and law and studied under the Chishti shaykh Usman Harooni (Harvani). He moved to Lahore and then to Ajmer, where he died. His tomb, in Ajmer, is the Dargah Sharif, a popular shrine and pilgrimage site.

Moinuddin was followed by Qutab-ud-Din Bakhtyar Kaki and Farīduddīn Mas&#x27;ūd &#x27;Baba Farid&#x27;. After Fariduddin, the Chishti Order of South Asia split into two branches. Each branch was named after one of Fariduddin&#x27;s successors.

# Nizamuddin Auliya – the &quot;Chishti Nizami&quot; branch
# Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari – the &quot;Chishti-Sabiri&quot; branch

It was after Nizamuddin Auliya that the Chishti Sufism chain spread throughout the Indian Peninsula. Two prominent lines of transmission arose from Nizamuddin Auliya, one from his disciple Nasiruddin Chiragh Dehlavi and the other from another disciple, Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind, who migrated to West Bengal from Delhi on Nizamuddin Auliya&#x27;s order. Siraj Aanae Hind was followed by his notable disciple Alaul Haq Pandavi settled in Pandava, West Bengal itself. From this chain of transmission another prominent sub-branch of Chishti way emerged known as Ashrafia Silsila after the illustrious saint Ashraf Jahangir Semnani, who was the disciple of Alaul Haq Pandavi in the thirteen century A.D. Later, yet other traditions branched from the Chishti lineage; in many cases they merged with other popular Sufi orders in South Asia.

As a result of this merging of the Chishti order with other branches, most Sufi masters now initiate their disciples in all the four major orders of South Asia: the Qadiri, Chishti, Naqshbandi, and Suhrawadi Sufi orders. They do however teach devotional practices typical of the order with which they are primarily associated.

In 1937 the Sufi Imam Al-Hajj Wali Akram founded the First Cleveland Mosque, made his Sufi affiliation public and during the 1950s started to introduce new members to the Chishti, making the mosque the first public Sufi center of the United States. In more recent times, a more contemporary expression of traditional Chishti Sufi practices can be found in the establishment of the Ishq-Nuri Tariqa in the 1960s, as a branch of the Chishti-Nizami &quot;silsila&quot;.

In addition, a number of mixed-Sufi type groups or movements in Islam, have also been influenced by the Chishti Order proper. The best known and most widespread example is of the Jamaat Ahle Sunnat, a Sunni Muslim sect with a huge international following, which is in essence not a proper Sufi organization, though adopting many Sufi customs and traditions.

==Indo-Islamic rulers==

From the 14th century onwards (during the rule of the Tughluqs), the Chishti Order came to be associated with political prosperity for the Indian subcontinent&#x27;s Muslim kingdoms. The Delhi Sultanate, Bahmani Sultanate, Bengal Sultanate, and various provincial dynasties associated themselves with Shaikhs of the Chishti Order for good fortune. Shrines of prominent Shaikhs were patronised by ruling dynasties, who made pilgrimages to these sites. Often the founding member of a kingdom paid respects to a Chishti Shaikh as a way of legitimising their new state, and this Shaikh became closely associated with the whole dynasty. For example, fourteen successive Bengal Sultans considered Shaikh &#x27;Ala Al-Haq to be their spiritual master.

Several rulers of the Mughal dynasty of South Asia were Chishti devotees, and they associated with the Order in a similar fashion to the Mughals&#x27; predecessors. The emperor Akbar was perhaps the most fervent of them. It is said to be by the blessing of Shaikh Salim Chishti that Akbar&#x27;s first surviving child, the future Jahangir, was born. The child was named Salim after the sheikh and was affectionately addressed by Akbar as &quot;Sheikhu Baba&quot;.

Akbar also credited the Chishti Shaikhs with his victory at the Siege of Chittorgarh. Akbar had vowed to visit the Chishti dargah, the tomb of Moinuddin Chishti, at Ajmer if he were victorious. He fulfilled his vow by visiting the dargah with his musicians, who played in honor of the sheikh.

Shah Jahan&#x27;s daughter, Jahanara Begum Sahib, was also a devout follower of the Chishti Order. Shah Jahan&#x27;s son Aurangzeb patronised various Chishti shrines.

<text>The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is an image of a small region in the constellation Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. It covers an area about 2.6 arcminutes on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100 metres. The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope&#x27;s Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 over ten consecutive days between December 18 and 28, 1995.

The field is so small that only a few foreground stars in the Milky Way lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are galaxies, some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image in the study of the early universe.

Three years after the HDF observations were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named the Hubble Deep Field South. The similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the universe is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the cosmological principle). A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive astronomical image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) was released in 2012.

==Conception==
One of the key aims of the astronomers who designed the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies to a level of detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10 m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope&#x27;s mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows a better understanding of how they evolve.

After the spherical aberration was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging capabilities of the telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.

Up to 10% of the HST&#x27;s observation time is designated as Director&#x27;s Discretionary (DD) Time, and is typically awarded to astronomers who wish to study unexpected transient phenomena, such as supernovae. Once Hubble&#x27;s corrective optics were shown to be performing well, Robert Williams, the then-director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, decided to devote a substantial fraction of his DD time during 1995 to the study of distant galaxies. A special Institute Advisory Committee recommended that the WFPC2 be used to image a &quot;typical&quot; patch of sky at a high galactic latitude, using several optical filters. A working group was set up to develop and implement the project.

==Target selection==
The field selected for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It had to be at a high galactic latitude because dust and obscuring matter in the plane of the Milky Way&#x27;s disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes (see Zone of Avoidance). The target field had to avoid known bright sources of visible light (such as foreground stars), and infrared, ultraviolet, and X-ray emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background infrared cirrus, the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas (H I regions).

These criteria restricted the field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble&#x27;s continuous viewing zones: the areas of sky that are not occulted by the Earth or the moon during Hubble&#x27;s orbit. The working group decided to concentrate on the northern continuous viewing zone, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the Keck telescopes, the Kitt Peak National Observatory telescopes, and the Very Large Array (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.

Twenty fields satisfying these criteria were identified, from which three optimal candidate fields were selected, all within the constellation of Ursa Major. Radio snapshot observations with the VLA ruled out one of these fields because it contained a bright radio source, and the final decision between the other two was made on the basis of the availability of guide stars near the field: Hubble observations normally require a pair of nearby stars on which the telescope&#x27;s Fine Guidance Sensors can lock during an exposure, but given the importance of the HDF observations, the working group required a second set of back-up guide stars. The field that was eventually selected is located at a right ascension of and a declination of ; it is about 2.6 arcminutes in width, or 1/12 the width of the Moon. The area is about 1/24,000,000 of the total area of the sky.

==Observations==

Once a field was selected, an observing strategy was developed. An important decision was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with 48 filters, including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters useful for the study of the colors of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the throughput of each filter—the total proportion of light that it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.

In the end, four broadband filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450 nm (blue light), 606 nm (red light) and 814 nm (near-infrared). Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble&#x27;s detectors at 300 nm wavelength is quite low, the noise in observations at this wavelength is primarily due to CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.

Between December 18 and 28, 1995—during which time Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times—342 images of the target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total exposure times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300 nm), 33.5 hours (450 nm), 30.3 hours (606 nm) and 34.3 hours (814 nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by cosmic rays, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.

==Data processing==

The production of a final combined image at each wavelength was a complex process. Bright pixels caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by cosmic rays in one exposure but not the other. Trails of space debris and artificial satellites were present in the original images, and were carefully removed.

Scattered light from the Earth was evident in about a quarter of the data frames, creating a visible &quot;X&quot; pattern on the images. This was removed by taking an image affected by scattered light, aligning it with an unaffected image, and subtracting the unaffected image from the affected one. The resulting image was smoothed, and could then be subtracted from the bright frame. This procedure removed almost all of the scattered light from the affected images.

Once the 342 individual images were cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, they had to be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called &#x27;drizzling&#x27;, in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.

The data processing yielded four monochrome images (at 300 nm, 450 nm, 606 nm and 814 nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814 nm), the second as green (606 nm) and the third as blue (450 nm), and the three images were combined to give a color image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colors in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colors of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colors corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.

==Contents==
The final images were released at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in January 1996, and revealed a plethora of distant, faint galaxies. About 3,000 distinct galaxies could be identified in the images, with both irregular and spiral galaxies clearly visible, although some galaxies in the field are only a few pixels across. In all, the HDF is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars; by far the majority of objects in the field are distant galaxies.

There are about fifty blue point-like objects in the HDF. Many seem to be associated with nearby galaxies, which together form chains and arcs: these are likely to be regions of intense star formation. Others may be distant quasars. Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are white dwarfs, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.

==Scientific results==

The HDF data provided extremely rich material for cosmologists to analyse and by late 2014 the associated scientific paper for the image had received over 900 citations. One of the most fundamental findings was the discovery of large numbers of galaxies with high redshift values.

As the Universe expands, more distant objects recede from the Earth faster, in what is called the Hubble Flow. The light from very distant galaxies is significantly affected by the cosmological redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes. One of the first observations planned for the James Webb Space Telescope was a mid-infrared image of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field.

The HDF galaxies contained a considerably larger proportion of disturbed and irregular galaxies than the local universe; galaxy collisions and mergers were more common in the young universe as it was much smaller than today. It is believed that giant elliptical galaxies form when spirals and irregular galaxies collide.

The wealth of galaxies at different stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of star formation over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies are somewhat crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8–10 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.

Another important result from the HDF was the very small number of foreground stars present. For years astronomers had been puzzling over the nature of dark matter, mass which seems to be undetectable but which observations implied made up about 85% of all matter in the Universe by mass. One theory was that dark matter might consist of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs)—faint but massive objects such as red dwarfs and planets in the outer regions of galaxies. The HDF showed, however, that there were not significant numbers of red dwarfs in the outer parts of our galaxy.

==Multifrequency followup==
Very-high redshift objects (Lyman-break galaxies) cannot be seen in visible light and generally are detected in infrared or submillimetre wavelength surveys of the HDF instead. Observations with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation. Infrared observations have also been made with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Submillimeter observations of the field have been made with SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, initially detecting 5 sources, although with very low resolution. Observations have also been made with the Subaru telescope in Hawaii.

X-ray observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed six sources in the HDF, which were found to correspond to three elliptical galaxies, one spiral galaxy, one active galactic nucleus and one extremely red object, thought to be a distant galaxy containing a large amount of dust absorbing its blue light emissions.

Ground-based radio images taken using the VLA revealed seven radio sources in the HDF, all of which correspond to galaxies visible in the optical images. The field has also been surveyed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the MERLIN array of radio telescopes at 1.4 GHz; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20 cm have located 16 radio sources in the HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields. Radio images of some individual sources in the field have been made with the European VLBI Network at 1.6 GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.

==Subsequent HST observations==
An HDF counterpart in the southern celestial hemisphere was created in 1998: the HDF-South (HDF-S). Created using a similar observing strategy, the HDF-S was very similar in appearance to the original HDF. This supports the cosmological principle that at its largest scale the Universe is homogeneous. The HDF-S survey used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the region of the original Hubble Deep Field (HDF-N) has since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, as well as by the NICMOS and STIS instruments. Several supernova events were detected by comparing the first and second epoch observations of the HDF-N.

A wider survey, but less sensitive, was carried out as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey; a section of this was then observed for longer to create the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, which was the most sensitive optical deep field image for years until the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field was completed in 2012. Images from the Extreme Deep Field, or XDF, were released on September 26, 2012, to a number of media agencies. Images released in the XDF show galaxies which are now believed to have formed in the first 500 million years following the Big Bang.

<text>The Hutt Valley campaign was an armed conflict in the lower North Island of New Zealand between indigenous Māori and British settlers and military forces in 1846. The campaign was among the earliest of the 19th century New Zealand Wars that were fought over issues of land and sovereignty. It was preceded by the Wairau affray (June 1843) and followed by the Wanganui campaign (April–July 1847) and was triggered by much the same pressures—the careless land purchasing practices of the New Zealand Company, armed government support for settler land claims, and complex intertribal tensions between local Māori. The three conflicts also shared many of the same combatants.

The campaign&#x27;s most notable clashes were the Māori dawn raid on an imperial stockade at Boulcott&#x27;s Farm in the Hutt Valley on 16 May 1846 in which eight British soldiers and at least two Māori died, and the Battle of Battle Hill from 6–13 August as British troops, local militia and &quot;kūpapa&quot; Māori pursued a Ngāti Toa force led by chief Te Rangihaeata through steep and dense bushland. Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha was taken into custody during the campaign; he was detained without charge in Auckland for two years.

A 2003 report by the Waitangi Tribunal concluded the New Zealand Company&#x27;s 1839 land purchases were invalid and that the Crown committed a number of breaches of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi in subsequent dealings with Māori in the area.

==Background to war==
Tensions rose in the mid-1840s as settlers and Māori were left to deal with the consequences of haphazard and often dubious land purchases by the New Zealand Company. The boundaries of purchased land and Māori reserves were often only vaguely indicated, creating confusion and conflict. The company&#x27;s purchasing agents seldom questioned the right of vendors to sell the land, whose possession even Māori disputed among themselves and Māori who lived in the Hutt Valley under customary rights were forcefully evicted by the government with little or no compensation for their homes and extensive cultivations.

===New Zealand Company land dealings===

The Heretaunga (Hutt Valley) area had been lightly and sporadically populated until the 1830s by a number of small tribes (or &quot;hapu&quot;), which were driven out during successive waves of migration from northern invaders, ultimately leaving the area in the control of Te Rauparaha of Ngāti Toa, who in turn had granted rights of occupation to Ngāti Rangatahi.

Ngāti Mutunga had established &quot;ahi kā&quot;, or a long historical association with the area and was therefore in a position to sell land, but had departed by September 1839, when the New Zealand Company vessel &quot;Tory&quot; arrived at Port Nicholson to purchase land for its settlements.

Unaware of these complexities, and disregarding advice that Te Rauparaha had conquered all the land around Cook Strait and was widely accepted by those who lived on the land as the final owner, the New Zealand Company distributed payment to six chiefs for vast, but poorly defined expanses of land in the Port Nicholson (Wellington) area. Among the recipients was Ngāti Tama chief Te Kaeaea (also known as Taringa Kuri, or &quot;Dog&#x27;s Ear&quot;), then living at Kaiwharawhara in subservience to Te Rauparaha. Ngāti Rangatahi, although it had been in the Heretaunga district seasonally since the early 1830s, was offered nothing, although its territory was included in the purchase. Te Rauparaha, who also saw himself as the owner by right of conquest, objected strongly to the purchases.

New Zealand Company settlers began arriving at Port Nicholson from January 1840 in numbers that shocked Māori, who soon found Pākehā trampling over their homes, gardens and cemeteries, and in places sticking survey pegs in the ground. Taringa Kuri and his Ngati Tama people moved to the Hutt Valley because of incursions on their cultivation land at Kaiwharawhara by settlers and their cattle, while in Porirua Te Rauparaha&#x27;s nephew and fellow Ngāti Toa chief Te Rangihaeata menaced surveyors and settlers who attempted to take possession of land there.

===Spain commission===

In January 1841 Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Lord John Russell appointed lawyer William Spain as Land Claims Commissioner to investigate and determine the validity of the New Zealand Company purchases. Spain arrived in Auckland in December and began his hearings into the Port Nicholson dealings in May 1842.

The New Zealand Company frustrated Spain&#x27;s efforts to make a full investigation of its entitlement to land and in June 1843 it pushed ahead with surveying of the disputed Wairau Plains in the South Island, despite requests by Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata to halt pending Spain&#x27;s decision on the legality of the purchase. An abortive bid by settlers and company representatives to arrest the two chiefs for impeding them resulted in the bloody Wairau Affray.

In a preliminary report in 1843 Spain stated that many of the Māori taking part in the original Port Nicholson transaction in 1839 would not have understood that by signing the deed they were selling their land, including pā and cultivations. He noted that &quot;the greater portion of the land claimed by the Company in the Port Nicholson district, and also in the district between Port Nicholson and Wanganui, including the latter place, has not been alienated by the natives to the New Zealand Company; and that the other portions of the same districts have been only partially alienated by the natives to that body&quot;.

Despite the company&#x27;s inability to prove it had made a valid purchase of land—and the Treaty of Waitangi&#x27;s guarantee that Māori would have undisturbed possession of their lands so long as they wished to retain them—Spain in early 1843 ceased public hearings and began serving as an arbitrator or umpire in negotiations between the New Zealand Company and Protector of Aborigines George Clarke Junior on how Māori should be &quot;compensated&quot; for the alienation of their land. Without consulting Māori, the two sides agreed on 29 January 1844 that the New Zealand Company would make a further £1500 payment as compensation &quot;to natives who may be entitled to receive it&quot; for about 67,000 acres, including surveyed sections in the Hutt Valley.

Spain convened a special sitting of the Court of Land Claims at Te Aro pā on 23 February where he informed its occupants of the agreement and asked them to sign deeds of release in exchange for payment. The deeds indicated acceptance of &quot;an absolute surrender of all our title to all our claims in all our lands which are written in the Document&quot; except pā, cultivations, sacred places and reserves. Te Aro Māori demanded further payment, but relented four days later when Ngāti Mutunga chief Pōmare—visiting the area from his new home in the Chatham Islands—advised them to accept the offer. Te Aro gave a third of their £300 payment to Pōmare, who then returned to the Chatham Islands. Another £530 was distributed to Māori of Kumutoto, Pipitea and Tiakiwai pā the same day.

Spain, who in early February had gained in-principle agreement from Te Rauparaha about compensating Ngāti Toa for land at Port Nicholson, met the chief again on 8 and 9 March 1844 at Porirua, this time also with Te Rangihaeata. When he attempted to secure their signatures to a deed of release for their interest in land at Port Nicholson, Te Rauparaha claimed he had previously been unaware it would include payment for Heretaunga, which he now refused to relinquish. Te Rauparaha said he considered &quot;Port Nicholson&quot; to mean all the land seaward of the Rotokakahi Stream, about 2 km up the Heretaunga (Hutt) River. Spain raised his cash offer, offering Te Rauparaha another £100 to compensate for lost crops if he ensured Taringa Kuri left the valley immediately.

Taringa Kuri then began cutting a line through bush at Rotokakahi, warning government officials it was the northern boundary of &quot;Port Nicholson&quot; land for which the New Zealand Company had secured its deeds of settlement. On 12 November, Clarke wrote a document acknowledging the receipt by Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata of the £400 for the &quot;surrender&quot; of Heretaunga. The Waitangi Tribunal noted that the document did not define the boundaries of the land that had been surrendered and gave Ngāti Toa no guarantee of reserves. It said the document was not signed by Te Rangihaeata, who received no share of the money until March 1845. The tribunal said there was no indication Ngāti Tama received any of the £100 compensation for their crops, nor was Ngāti Rangatahi offered or given compensation for being ousted from their land.

From November 1844 the government intensified its efforts to oust Ngāti Tama and Ngāti Rangatahi from the Hutt Valley, for the first time gaining support from Te Rauparaha, who agreed they should leave. But the Hutt Valley Māori reacted with a display of defiance to both Te Rauparaha and the government, expanding their bush clearings and cultivations and protesting that they had never been compensated for their loss of land. Government officials now began to suggest that force might be required to remove them to make way for European settlers.

==Tensions escalate==
Fearing a new outbreak of violence and conscious of the parallels between Hutt Valley land tensions and those that had resulted in bloodshed at Wairau two years earlier—in both cases Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata were the chief Māori protagonists in a struggle over dubious land sales to settlers—a militia force was formed in Wellington in 1845, with about 220 men mustering daily for military drill series of stockades. A series of redoubts and stockades were built in the Wellington area, including &quot;Fort Richmond&quot; beside the Hutt River, with further small outposts at Boulcott&#x27;s Farm and Taita. All were manned by militia until the steady arrival of almost 800 British troops from Auckland and the Bay of Islands, under command of Lieutenant Colonel William Hulme, 96th Regiment, in February 1846.

Governor George Grey arrived in New Zealand in November 1845 and began to adopt a more aggressive approach than his predecessor, Robert Fitzroy, to resolve the land issues. In mid-February 1846 he visited the Hutt Valley and secured a commitment from Taringa Kuri that Ngāti Tama would quit the area within a week, abandoning the 120 hectares of potatoes they had been growing. Grey refused to compensate them for crops and houses, claiming their occupation had been illegal. When settlers began moving on to the vacated land and met resistance from some remaining Māori, Grey sent a 340-strong military force into the valley on 24 February. He then sent a message to Ngāti Rangatahi chief Kaparatehau, demanding that he abandon the village of Maraenuku, beside the Hutt River, and threatened an immediate attack if they had not left by noon the next day, 25 February. Kaparatehau agreed. Houses in the village were ransacked by Europeans the night they left and on 27 February British troops marched into the village and burned what remained, desecrating the village chapel and burial place in the process. Aggrieved Ngāti Rangatahi retaliated on 1 and 3 March by raiding nearby settlers’ farms, destroying furniture, smashing windows, killing pigs and threatening the settlers with death if they raised an alarm.

Ignoring Crown law advice that his expulsion of Ngāti Rangatahi had been illegal because FitzRoy&#x27;s deeds of settlements had excluded native cultivations and homes—and that Māori had been justified in resorting to arms to resist eviction—Grey declared martial law on 3 March in the Wellington District, south of Paekākāriki. The same morning a party of Māori fired several volleys the 96th&#x27;s grenadier company, under command of Captain Eyton, near Boulcott&#x27;s Farm, 3 km north of Fort Richmond but was repulsed when the troops returned fire. Grey ordered HMS &quot;Driver&quot; to take reinforcements to Petone—50 of the 58th, 20 of the 96th and 30 of the 99th, under command of Lieutenant Edward Barclay, 96th. In late March two Māori were arrested and put on trial for taking part in the plundering of settlers&#x27; homes at the beginning of the month; days later, on 2 April, farmer Andrew Gillespie and his son were fatally attacked by tomahawk on vacated land on which Gillespie&#x27;s family had newly settled. Te Rauparaha sent word to Grey that the killers were Whanganui Māori unconnected with Ngāti Toa and could be found at Porirua. The suspects fled into bushland when a police party was sent from Wellington to capture them.

Troops discovered a newly built stockaded and entrenched stronghold at the head of the Pauatahanui inlet in Porirua Harbour occupied by Te Rangihaeata and Grey responded by dispatching 250 troops to establish a garrison at present-day Plimmerton and starting work on a military road from Wellington to Porirua.

==Boulcott&#x27;s Farm==
Ignoring warnings from Te Rauparaha and Te Āti Awa chief Te Puni that an armed strike was imminent, Port Nicholson police magistrate Major M. Richmond disbanded the militia in Wellington and reduced the strength of his Hutt Valley forces. But at daybreak on 16 May 1846 a force of 200 Ngāti Toa and Ngāti-Hāua-te-Rangi warriors, led by Upper Whanganui chief Topine Te Mamaku, launched an attack on the imperial outpost at Boulcott&#x27;s Farm.

The battle took place on the morning of May 16, 1846. About half an hour before daylight that morning, the Sentry in front of where the inlying pickett&#x27;s tent, observed several Māoris creeping towards them. Screening themselves with bushes and branches of scrub. Who reported to have had at least 50 guns. The sentry screamed &quot;Maoris&quot; then he fired, but was overpowered. Two volleys were fired at the four-man English picket, or advance position. Te Mamaku&#x27;s fighters rushed the tents with tomahawks. William Allen, ran from his tent and raised his bugle to sound the alarm just as one of the attackers felled him with a tomahawk, almost severing his right arm. He snatched up the bugle with his left hand and again started to sound the alarm as a second blow killed him. They then turned their attention on the remaining 45 men in the Boulcott&#x27;s garrison. Half the force of soldiers at Boulcott&#x27;s Farm were quartered in a large barn, around which a stockade of slabs and small logs had been erected and loopholed for musket-fire. The rest of the troops were accommodated in small slab outhouses near the barn.

Lieutenant Page&#x27;s house was surrounded by the Māoris after a few moments after the destruction of the picket. Page, who had snatched up his sword and loaded his gun, rushed out with two men, fought their way from the house in which they were besieged to a barn, where half the force were quartered. Page ordered his men to advance in the open with fixed bayonets and were reinforced by a party of seven members of the Hutt militia, on hearing the firing, advanced to Boulcott&#x27;s and took part in the fight and joined against Te Mamaku&#x27;s forces about 90 minutes after the attack began. The firefight lasted about an hour and a half. Six soldiers were killed and four were wounded in the battle. Private Patrick Haslamn assisted in putting them in their blankets, and laying their bodies in their last resting-place at the farm. And one soldier died of wounds who was buried with military honours and a settler, also died some days later. There is no reliable account of Maori casualties. But Māori losses were thought to be two dead and 10 or more wounded. The defenders managed to take prisoners. On 16 November 1846 five Māori prisoners arrived at Hobart for armed resistance against the Crown. Te Umuroa, Te Waretiti, Te Kumete, Matai-umu and Te Rāhui were sentenced to a penal colony following their involvement. Two years later they were pardoned and returned to New Zealand but one of them, Te Umuroa, had died of tuberculosis.

A month after the battle, Māori who had fought at Boulcott&#x27;s Farm taunted the colonial forces by playing Allen&#x27;s bugle, which they had taken as a trophy. Allen&#x27;s bugle was later recovered in one of Te Rangihaeata&#x27;s deserted camps at Battle Hill. The conflict highlighted rising tensions regarding land purchases, particularly transactions negotiated by the New Zealand Company.

The scare prompted military authorities to arm 250 kūpapa, or &quot;friendly&quot;, Te Āti Awa Māori who served under chief Te Puni to protect settlers, while Te Aro settlers formed a volunteer force that began nightly patrols of the settlement, guarding against an expected hostile Māori attack.

A second settler, Richard Rush, was killed in a tomahawk attack on 15 June and the following day a 74-strong composite force of Regular troops, Hutt Militia and Te Āti Awa Māori marched north from Boulcott&#x27;s Farm and became involved in a skirmish with hostile Māori near Taita, resulting in several of the imperial forces being wounded.

A memorial stone at the corner of High Street and Military Road in Lower Hutt lists the names of eight soldiers from the British 58th and 99th Regiments who were killed in action or died of wounds following the attack at Boulcott&#x27;s Farm. There is a stone in the cemetery at St James&#x27;s Church, Lower Hutt.

==Capture of Te Rauparaha==
Warned that a large war party of Upper Whanganui Māori led by warrior chiefs Ngapara and Maketu was on the march down the west coast to reinforce Te Rangihaeata and Te Mamaku, Grey on 18 June extended martial law northwards to Whanganui. The reinforcements were reported to have been summoned by Te Rauparaha in a letter that had been sighted by a Whanganui settler.

Grey gained the agreement of Te Āti Awa chief Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke, based near Waikanae, that he would block and attack the Upper Whanganui &quot;taua&quot;&#x27;s advance if it passed along the coast through his territory. The Governor then launched a dawn raid on Te Rauparaha&#x27;s village of Taupo, near present-day Plimmerton, on 23 July, arresting the chief on the basis that he had committed treason by supplying arms, ammunition and provisions to Te Rangihaeata, who was in rebellion against the government. Several other chiefs were seized and homes in surrounding villages searched for weapons and ammunition. When news of the arrests reached Te Rangihaeata, a rescue attempt by 50 warriors was mounted but easily driven off. Grey&#x27;s prisoners were transferred to HMS &quot;Calliope&quot;, which sailed to Auckland, and they were detained without charge as prisoners of war for ten months. Te Rauparaha remained under detention in Auckland until 1848.

==Battle Hill==

On 31 July 1846 a 213-strong combined force of Hutt militia, armed police and 150 Te Āti Awa set off overland to launch a surprise rear attack on Te Rangihaeta&#x27;s stronghold at Pauatahanui. But the occupants of the pā were alerted as the forces approached early the next day and were able to flee. The Pauatahanui pā was commandeered as an imperial military post to help guard construction work on the main road northwards.

Two days later, on 3 August, Major Edward Last began to lead the government force north through the heavily forested Horokiri ranges in pursuit of Te Rangihaeata and Te Mamaku. The force comprised Regulars, seaman from the &quot;Calliope&quot;, militia, armed police and several hundred Māori allies from Te Āti Awa and Ngāti Toa, supported by a detachment of Pioneers armed with axes and other cutting tools to cut through the bush.

Te Rangihaeata&#x27;s stronghold was discovered on 6 August at the crest of a steep ridge, surrounded by strong fortifications and three of the British force were killed in an exchange of fire that lasted several hours until nightfall. The force withdrew from the hill and a detachment of seamen were sent back to Pauatahanui to bring up two mortars. The weapons were carried in on 7 August and about 80 shells were fired throughout 8 August from a range of about 1200 metres. Some of the force also skirmished with Te Rangihaeata&#x27;s warriors in the bush near the pā.
By 10 August, Last had concluded a decisive victory was unattainable and the majority of the force was withdrawn, leaving a Māori attack force to maintain fire. Three days later they discovered Te Rangihaeata and his entire force had evacuated under cover of darkness and rain. Delayed by storms, the &quot;kūpapa&quot; Māori, including a Ngãti Toa detachment led by Rawiri Puaha, began a pursuit on 17 August through heavy bush across steep ridges, deep valleys and rocky streams, with both sides suffering casualties in sporadic exchanges of gunfire. Te Rangihaeata finally entrenched himself with about 100 men at a pā named Poroutawhao in swampland between Horowhenua and the Manawatu, while Te Mamaku returned with his force to his Whanganui River base.

The site of the 6–10 August battle has been preserved as a recreational area named Battle Hill Farm Forest Park.

==Waitangi Tribunal==

The Waitangi Tribunal issued a report in 2003 on 13 claims relating to the area covered by the New Zealand Company&#x27;s 1839 Port Nicholson deed of purchase, as extended in 1844 to the southwest coast. It identified Māori groups with &quot;ahi ka&quot; rights in the Port Nicholson block in 1840, which included Ngāti Toa in the Heretaunga and concluded that the Crown had failed to adequately compensate Ngāti Toa, Ngāti Rangatahi and Ngāti Tama for their loss of lands and cultivations.

The tribunal found that the 1839 Port Nicholson deed of purchase was invalid and conferred no rights to either the New Zealand Company or those to whom it on-sold its land. It found that the Crown had failed to protect the treaty rights of Māori to sell their land at a fair price and it was critical of the decision to switch from proceeding with Spain&#x27;s inquiry to implementing a form of arbitration without the informed consent of Māori.

<text>Boffius is a genus of mammal from the Paleocene of Europe, which was named by Vianey-Liaud M. in 1979. It is a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata. 

Boffius lies within the suborder Cimolodonta and is the only known member of the family Boffiidae (Hahn &amp; Hahn, 1983). The species &quot;Boffius splendidus&quot; is known from the Lower Paleocene Hainin Formation found in Hainaut, Belgium. It was a relatively large multituberculate. A 2021 study recovers it as part of Djadochtatherioidea.

== Critical reception ==

Although the production was derided by some critics as a &quot;dull musical backdrop&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Free&quot; was called a &quot;return to politically conscious rap&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album four stars and lauded its equation of &quot;classrooms with jail cells, the projects with killing fields and everything from water to television with conduits for brainwashing by the system&quot;.

<text>Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim (2 April 1719 – 18 February 1803) was a German poet, commonly associated with the Enlightenment and Rococo movements.

== Life ==
Gleim was born at the small town of Ermsleben in the Principality of Halberstadt, then part of Prussia. His father, a tax collector, and his mother died early. He attended school in Wernigerode and from 1738 onwards studied law at the University of Halle, where he established a circle of young poets together with his friends Johann Uz and Johann Nikolaus Götz.

Having obtained his final degree, he worked as a tutor in Berlin, where in 1743–44 he became secretary to the Hohenzollern prince Frederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Gleim accompanied his employer in the Second Silesian War and made the acquaintance of Ewald Christian von Kleist, whose devoted friend he became. When the prince was killed during the Prussian siege of Prague, Gleim became secretary to Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau; but he soon gave up his position, not being able to bear the roughness of the &quot;Old Dessauer&quot;.

In 1747, after again living in Berlin for a few years, he was appointed secretary of the Halberstadt Cathedral chapter. From 1756 he also served as a canon at the nearby Walbeck monastery. He became known as &quot;Father Gleim&quot; throughout all literary Germany on account of his kind-hearted though inconsiderate and undiscriminating patronage alike of the poets and poetasters of the period.

He died at the age of 83 in Halberstadt, then completely blind, but a wealthy and respected citizen. He was buried in his garden on the Holtemme river.

==Work==
Gleim&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot; appeared in seven volumes from 1811 until 1813; a reprint of the &quot;Lieder eines Grenadiers&quot; was published by A. Sauer in 1882. A good selection of Gleim&#x27;s poetry was published in Franz Muncker&#x27;s &quot;Anakreontiker und preussisch-patriotische Lyriker&quot; (1894) and Friedrich Wilhelm Körte&#x27;s &quot;Gleims Leben aus seinen Briefen und Schriften&quot; (1811). His correspondence with Johann Jakob Wilhelm Heinse was published in two volumes (1894/1896), with Johann Uz (1889), in both cases edited by C. Schüddekopf.

Influenced by the aesthetic writings of Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten and Georg Friedrich Meier, both lecturers at the Halle university, Gleim attempted to cultivate the Anacreontic tradition of short lyrical pieces of an easy kind. He wrote a large number of imitations of Anacreon, Horace and the minnesingers, a didactic poem inspired from his reading in the Quran entitled &quot;Halladat oder das rote Buch&quot; (1774), and collections of fables and romances. Many of his poems were set to music: C.P.E. Bach, Beethoven, Joseph Haydn, Reichardt, Schubart, and Spohr all set some of his Anacreontic poems.

Of higher merit are his &quot;Preussische Kriegslieder von einem Grenadier&quot; (1758). Inspired by the Prussian campaigns of King Frederick the Great in the Seven Years&#x27; War, they are often distinguished by genuine feeling and vigorous force of expression. They are also noteworthy as being the first of that long series of noble political songs in which later German literature is so rich. Written in a &quot;Chevy Chase&quot; tune and first set to music by Christian Gottfried Krause, the &quot;Kriegslieder&quot; attracted wide attention in a poetry collection edited by Lessing in 1758, and later were also set by Telemann and Schubart.
Compared to this collection, Gleim&#x27;s other writings, though also very popular in his day, were for the most part considered commonplace in thought and expression by later generations. Only recently, a revaluation of his work in the context of 18th century literary history has taken place. Significant contributions of Gleim include the establishment of German as literary language and his promotion of young talents such as Heinse, Johann Heinrich Voss, Seume, and Jean Paul.

==Gleimhaus==

After Gleim&#x27;s death in Halberstadt, his personal effects were carefully looked after by his great-nephew, Friedrich Wilhelm Körte (1776–1846). In 1862, Gleim&#x27;s library of 12,000 books (including 50 incunabula) and the huge collection of letters, manuscripts and documents in his estate were used as the kernel of a museums of 18th century literary life in Halberstadt and beyond. Augmented by the collection of the local poet Christian Friedrich Bernhard Augustin (1771–1856) and still in operation, the Gleimhaus is one of the oldest literary museums in Germany.

==Temple of Friendship==

At his house near Halberstadt Cathedral, Gleim created a Temple of Friendship (), regular meetings of poets and intellectuals including Johann Georg Jacobi, Heinse, Christoph August Tiedge, Leopold Friedrich Günther von Goeckingk and many others. Two rooms he devoted to a collection of portraits of friends, which numbered more than 120 by the time of his death. Artists commissioned by Gleim included Anton Graff, various members of the Tischbein family, Bernhard Rode and Benjamin Calau.

==Gleim Prize==
The Gleim Prize for Literature (&quot;Gleim-Literaturpreis&quot;), awarded for outstanding non-fiction on the subject of 18th century literature, was established in 1995.

<doc id="216613" wikidata="Q211531" url="?curid=216613" title="Invisible Pink Unicorn">
<text>The Invisible Pink Unicorn (IPU) is the goddess of a parody religion used to satirize theistic beliefs, taking the form of a unicorn that is paradoxically both invisible and pink. The IPU is a rhetorical illustration used by atheists and other religious skeptics as a contemporary version of Russell&#x27;s teapot, sometimes mentioned in conjunction with the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

The IPU is used to argue that supernatural beliefs are arbitrary by, for example, replacing the word &quot;God&quot; in any theistic statement with &quot;Invisible Pink Unicorn&quot;. The mutually exclusive attributes of pinkness and invisibility, coupled with the inability to disprove the IPU&#x27;s existence, satirize properties that some theists attribute to a theistic deity.

== History ==

Russell&#x27;s teapot is an analogy first coined by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making scientifically unfalsifiable claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others, specifically in the case of religion. Russell wrote that, if he claims that a teapot orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, it is nonsensical for him to expect others to believe him on the ground that they cannot prove him wrong. Russell&#x27;s teapot is still referred to in discussions concerning the existence of God.

The IPU seems to have become notable primarily through online culture: in addition to alt.atheism, where IPU frequently came up in discussions, there are now a number of web sites dedicated to her. An early documented reference to the IPU was on July 7, 1990, on the Usenet discussion group alt.atheism. Other sources concerning IPU state that she was &quot;revealed to us&quot; on alt.atheism.

The concept was further developed by a group of college students from 1994 to 1995 on the ISCA Telnet-based BBS. The students created a manifesto that detailed a nonsensical (yet internally consistent) religion based on a multitude of invisible pink unicorns. It is from this document that the most famous quotation concerning IPUs originated:

== Concepts ==

It is common when discussing the Invisible Pink Unicorn to point out that because she is invisible, no one can prove that she does not exist (or indeed that she is not pink). This is a parody of similar theistic claims about God: that God, as creator of the universe, is not subject to its laws and thus not physically detecting him tells us nothing about his existence or lack thereof. The Invisible Pink Unicorn is an illustration which attempts to demonstrate the absurdity of citing attributes and a lack of evidence as proof of a deity&#x27;s existence. Her two defining attributes, invisibility and color (pink), are inconsistent and contradictory; this is part of the satire. The paradox of something being invisible yet having visible characteristics (color) is reflected in some East Asian cultures, wherein an invisible red string is said to connect people who have a shared or linked destiny.

There are humorous mock debates amongst her &quot;followers&quot; concerning her other attributes, such as whether she is completely invisible or invisible to most, but visible only to those who have faith in her (bearing similarities to &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;). Some arguments are quite elaborate and tortuous, satirizing the disputatiousness and intricacy of the theological debates that occur in many religions.

The Invisible Pink Unicorn is also used to de-deify religious texts. The goal is to have the reader experience the text without heavily loaded concepts that many readers will associate with omnipotence, or will read with an unquestioned faith. It is argued that when someone re-reads the same text with all direct references to God replaced with the Invisible Pink Unicorn, the reader may see the text in a new and more critical way: 
== Similar concepts ==

In 1996, a unicorn that no one can see was adapted as a teaching device at Camp Quest, the first free-thought summer camp for children established in the United States, by Edwin F Kagin and the Free Inquiry Group of Cincinnati. As reported years later in the July 21, 2006 &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, &quot;Campers must try to prove that imaginary unicorns—as a metaphor for God—don&#x27;t exist.&quot; Richard Dawkins alluded to unicorns in this connection in his 2006 book &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, writing that &quot;Russell&#x27;s teapot, of course, stands for an infinite number of things whose existence is conceivable and cannot be disproved. [...] A philosophical favorite is the invisible, intangible, inaudible unicorn.&quot;

<text>Friedrich Hoffmann or Hofmann (19 February 1660 – 12 November 1742) was a German physician and chemist. He is also sometimes known in English as Frederick Hoffmann.

==Life==
His family had been connected with medicine for 200 years before him. Born in Halle, he attended the local gymnasium where he acquired that taste for and skill in mathematics to which he attributed much of his later success. Beginning at age 18, he studied medicine at the University of Jena. From there, in 1680, he went to Erfurt, to attend Kasper Cramer&#x27;s lectures on chemistry. Next year, returning to Jena, he received his doctor&#x27;s diploma, and, after publishing a thesis, was permitted to teach. Constant study then began to tell on his health, and in 1682, leaving his already numerous pupils, he opened a practice in Minden at the request of a relative who held a high position in that town. After practising at Minden for two years, Hoffmann made a journey to Holland and England, where he formed the acquaintance of many illustrious chemists and physicians. Towards the end of 1684, he returned to Minden, and during the next three years he received many flattering appointments. In 1688 he moved to the more promising sphere of Halberstadt, with the title of physician to the principality of Halberstadt.

In 1693, shortly after the establishment of the University of Halle, he was appointed primary professor of medicine and natural philosophy. During his career there, he held the position of rector three times. With the exception of four years (1708–1712), which he passed at Berlin in the capacity of royal physician, Hoffmann spent the rest of his life at Halle in instruction, practice and study, interrupted now and again by visits to different courts of Germany, where his services procured him honours and rewards. His fame became European. He was enrolled a member of many learned societies in different foreign countries (including being elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1720), while in his own he became privy councillor.

Hoffmann died on 12 November 1742 in Halle.

==Work==

Of his numerous writings a catalogue is to be found in Haller&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca medicinae practicae&quot;. The chief is &quot;Medicina rationalis systematica&quot;, undertaken at the age of sixty, and published in 1730. It was translated into French in 1739, under the title of &quot;Médecine raisonnée d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;. A complete edition of Hoffmann&#x27;s works, with a life of the author, was published at Geneva in 1740, to which supplements were added in 1753 and 1760. Editions appeared also at Venice in 1745 and at Naples in 1753 and 1793.

At the instigation of Robert Boyle, he turned to the analysis and uses of mineral waters and became a pioneer and chief promoter of their study, gave prescriptions for their use, taught how they could be imitated artificially, and analyzed many German springs. He concluded that solid constituents, such as lime, magnesia, etc., in the form of an alkali and carbonic acid, existed in almost all mineral springs. He wrote on healing springs as early as 1684. Georg Ernst Stahl opposed the general employment of mineral waters recommended by Hoffmann, though he did not question their utility in certain cases.

Hoffman is credited with conducting the first scientific investigation into carbon monoxide poisoning caused by burning charcoal. He rejected superstition that had attributed the death of several treasure seekers to paranormal activity and published &quot;Considerations on the Fatal Effects of the Vapor from Burning Charcoal&quot; in 1716 which characterized inhalation of polluted air from charcoal vapor causing suffocation similar to strangulation or drowning.

<text>Ronald David Wood (born 1 June 1947) is an English rock musician, best known as a member of the Rolling Stones since 1975, and a member of Faces and the Jeff Beck Group.

Wood began his career in 1964, playing lead guitar with several British rhythm and blues bands in short succession, including the Birds and the Creation. He joined the Jeff Beck Group in 1967 as a guitarist and bassist, playing on the albums &quot;Truth&quot; and &quot;Beck-Ola&quot;. The group split in 1969, and Wood departed along with lead vocalist Rod Stewart to join former Small Faces members Ronnie Lane, Ian McLagan and Kenney Jones in a new group named Faces with Wood now primarily on lead guitar. The group found great success in the UK and mainland Europe from the early days on, but only reached major fame in the US during their last year of existence, 1975, with a major tour of the US. Wood sang and co-wrote the title track from their final LP, &quot;Ooh La La&quot;, released in 1973. He also worked extensively on Stewart&#x27;s first few solo albums.

As Faces began to split, he started several solo projects, eventually recording his first solo LP, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Own Album to Do&quot;, in 1974. The album featured bandmate McLagan as well as former Beatle George Harrison and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, a longtime friend of Wood. Soon after Mick Taylor left the Rolling Stones, Richards invited Wood to join them; he did so in 1975, initially temporarily, but became an official member in 1976.

Besides &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Own Album to Do&quot;, Wood has recorded several other solo efforts. &quot;Now Look&quot; was released in 1975 and peaked at No. 118 on &quot;Billboard&quot;; he also collaborated with Ronnie Lane for the soundtrack album &quot;Mahoney&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;. Wood also released &quot;Gimme Some Neck&quot; in 1979, which hit No. 45 in the US; &quot;1234&quot; was released in 1981, peaking at No. 164. He released &quot;Slide on This&quot; in 1992, &quot;Not for Beginners&quot; in 2002, and &quot;I Feel Like Playing&quot; in 2010. As a member of the Rolling Stones, Wood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and was inducted a second time, as a member of Faces, in 2012.
==Early life==
Wood was born in Hillingdon, west London, into a family of English &quot;bargees&quot; (river or canal barge operators, sometimes called &quot;water gypsies&quot;). He has said that his generation was the first in the family to be born on dry land. He grew up in Yiewsley and attended St Stephen&#x27;s Infant School, St Matthew&#x27;s Church of England Primary School and St Martin&#x27;s C of E Secondary Modern School West Drayton.

Wood&#x27;s elder brothers, Art and Ted, were graphic artists as well as musicians; Ted Wood died in 2004 and Art Wood in 2006.

==Music career==
===1960s===
Wood began his career as a professional musician in 1964 as a lead guitarist with the Birds, a R&amp;B band based in Yiewsley, Middlesex. A popular live act with a considerable fan base, the Birds released several singles in the mid-1960s; Wood wrote or co-wrote nearly half the songs the group recorded.

By 1967, the Birds had disbanded, and Wood briefly took part in a project called Santa Barbara Machine Head which included later Deep Purple co-founder Jon Lord, before joining the Jeff Beck Group as a bassist. Along with vocalist Rod Stewart, Wood did several tours with Beck and recorded two albums: &quot;Truth&quot; in 1968 and &quot;Beck-Ola&quot; in 1969. In between Jeff Beck Group projects, Wood also worked with the Creation.

In Wood&#x27;s radio show on 14 November 2011, both Wood and Alice Cooper claimed that Wood performed the bass on the Crazy World of Arthur Brown&#x27;s number one hit &quot;Fire&quot;; Polly Marshall&#x27;s biography of Arthur Brown states that &quot;according to the-faces.com, Ronnie claims he played on the Track Records studio sessions recording Fire, but he must have confused it with the BBC session [of 8 April 1968].&quot; There is no bass guitar on the recording, only bass pedals.

In 1969, after Steve Marriott left the Small Faces, Wood began working with the remaining members of that group, returning to his instrument of choice, the guitar. This line-up, plus Rod Stewart and former Bird Kim Gardner, teamed up with Wood&#x27;s brother Art Wood in a formation called Quiet Melon, making a handful of recordings in May 1969. After the Jeff Beck Group&#x27;s fifth US tour in July, Wood and Stewart joined the former Small Faces full-time, and the band&#x27;s name was changed to Faces. During the summer of 1969, Stewart and Wood also set the template for what would become Faces on &quot;An Old Raincoat Won&#x27;t Ever Let You Down&quot;, Stewart&#x27;s first solo album (known as &quot;The Rod Stewart Album&quot; in the US). The backing band on the album also included Ian McLagan, Keith Emerson, Micky Waller and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer and later Armageddon and 7th Order), and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer).

===1970s===
In the first half of the 1970s, Faces released four studio albums and were among the top-grossing live acts of the period. Besides his distinctive guitar work, Wood contributed harmonica, vocals, and bass to the band&#x27;s recordings, and co-wrote many of their songs, including &quot;Stay With Me&quot; and &quot;Ooh La La&quot;. He also played on bandmate Stewart&#x27;s first few solo albums and is co-writer of the Rod Stewart songs &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; and &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot;, as well as several songs on &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot;.

In 1972, Wood and Faces bassist Ronnie Lane composed the soundtrack to the film &quot;Mahoney&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;; the soundtrack, which was released as an LP in 1976, also features Faces bandmates Ian McLagan and Kenney Jones, along with contributions from Pete Townshend and Ric Grech. Wood also performed with Townshend, Grech, Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Eric Clapton at Clapton&#x27;s Rainbow Concert in 1973.

In 1973, Wood asked his old friend Mick Taylor, whom he had known since the early 1960s, to help with his first solo album. In December 1973, Wood collaborated with Mick Jagger on the song &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock&#x27;n Roll (But I Like It)&quot;. Eventually, Jagger and Keith Richards also contributed to Wood&#x27;s solo LP. &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Own Album to Do&quot; was released in 1974, having been recorded at Wood&#x27;s private studio in the basement of The Wick, his home near London.

Following Taylor&#x27;s departure from the Rolling Stones in December 1974, Wood participated in the band&#x27;s March 1975 recording sessions for their forthcoming album &quot;Black and Blue&quot;. Although still a member of Faces, he toured North America with the Rolling Stones in 1975; Faces announced their break-up in December of that year, and Wood was officially declared a member of the Rolling Stones on 23 April 1976.

In the Rolling Stones, Wood plays the slide guitar as Taylor and Brian Jones had done before him, and added lap steel and pedal steel guitar to the band. Wood&#x27;s guitar interplay with Richards often blurs the boundaries between lead and rhythm roles, a practice borrowed from Chicago Blues which Richards dubbed &quot;the ancient art of weaving.&quot; Wood also occasionally plays bass guitar, as seen during 1975 concert performances of &quot;Fingerprint File&quot;, when Mick Jagger played rhythm guitar and bassist Bill Wyman moved to synthesizer. The Rolling Stones&#x27; single &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; also features Wood on bass. He has been given credit as a co-writer for over a dozen songs, including &quot;Dance&quot;, &quot;Black Limousine&quot;, &quot;One Hit (to the Body)&quot;, and &quot;Had It With You&quot;.

In 1975, Wood released his second solo album, &quot;Now Look&quot;; his third, &quot;Gimme Some Neck&quot;, came out in 1979. To promote it, Wood formed and toured with the New Barbarians, playing 20 concerts in Canada and the US in April/May and the Knebworth Festival in the UK in August.

===1980s===
Throughout the 1980s, Wood played as an official member of the Rolling Stones; continued his solo career, releasing the album &quot;1234&quot; in 1981; painted; and collaborated with a number of other artists, including Prince, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Bo Diddley, Ringo Starr and Aretha Franklin.

At the 1985 Live Aid Concert in Philadelphia, Wood along with Keith Richards performed in the penultimate set with Bob Dylan. During the performance of &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, one of Dylan&#x27;s guitar strings broke. Wood gave Dylan his guitar to keep the performance seamless and played air guitar until a stagehand brought him a replacement.

===1990s–2010s===
Wood was made a fully-fledged partner in the Rolling Stones&#x27; financial organisation in 1990. During the 1990s, the Rolling Stones released two studio albums and three concert albums, as well as touring in 1990, 1994–95, and 1997–99.

In addition, Wood released his seventh solo album, &quot;Slide on This&quot;, in 1992; he toured to promote this album in North America and Japan. His appearance in 1993 with former bandmate Rod Stewart on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; resulted in a hit album titled &quot;Unplugged...and Seated&quot;; the concert album that Wood released in 1993 from his tour was called &quot;Slide on Live: Plugged in and Standing&quot;.

Wood also contributed to Bo Diddley&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;A Man Amongst Men&quot;, playing slide guitar on the tracks &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;A Man Amongst Men&quot;, and &quot;Oops! Bo Diddley&quot;, and guitar on &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot;.

Since 2000, Wood has continued to combine solo work with his Rolling Stones schedule. After the 2001 release of his album &quot;Not For Beginners&quot;, Wood toured England and Ireland in 2001 and 2002 with his own group, The Ronnie Wood Band. The band included members of his family, Slash, Andrea Corr, Jesse Wood, Martin Wright, Tramper Price, Mark Wells, Leah Wood, and Frankie Gavin. After the tour, a DVD called &quot;Far East Man&quot; was released, a song co-written by Ronnie Wood and George Harrison.

Wood toured with the Rolling Stones in 2002 and 2003; in 2004, he performed several one-off concerts and guest appearances, including several appearances with Rod Stewart. Later in the year, the two expressed intentions to finish the studio work on a collaborative album, to be titled &quot;You Strum and I&#x27;ll Sing&quot;. In 2005, however, Wood was again busy with the Rolling Stones as the band recorded their &quot;A Bigger Bang&quot; album—although he played on only 10 of the album&#x27;s 16 tracks. He took part in the accompanying tour, which lasted until August 2007.

In 2005, Wood launched his own record company, Wooden Records, which has released recordings by his daughter Leah, the New Barbarians, and others.

In November 2006, during a break in the Rolling Stones&#x27; A Bigger Bang Tour, Wood played guitar on three tracks for British soul artist Beverley Knight&#x27;s album &quot;Music City Soul&quot;, released in 2007.

On 9 May 2009, Wood, along with Red Hot Chili Peppers members Anthony Kiedis, Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary, Chad Smith and musician Ivan Neville performed under the name &quot;the Insects&quot; at the fifth annual MusiCares event honouring Kiedis.

On 11 August 2009, Wood joined Pearl Jam on the stage of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London for a performance of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;.

On 25 October 2009, Wood, Ian McLagan, and Kenney Jones joined forces for a Faces performance at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on behalf of the Performing Rights Society&#x27;s Music Members&#x27; Benevolent Fund. Bill Wyman played bass; lead vocals were shared by several performers, notably Mick Hucknall. Rod Stewart, who had earlier denied rumours of plans for a Faces reunion in 2009, was not present. On 2 November 2009, Wood was given an &quot;Outstanding Contribution&quot; award at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour ceremony in London. Pete Townshend presented the award.

Since 9 April 2010, Wood has presented his own radio show on Absolute Radio. Airing on Saturday night at 10 pm, the one-hour show consists of Wood playing tracks by artists he has worked with and other personal favourites. In May 2011 Wood won the Sony Radio Personality of the Year award for &quot;The Ronnie Wood Show.&quot; 

In May 2023, Wood performed at the Jeff Beck tribute concerts held at the Royal Albert Hall, sharing the stage with Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton, Kirk Hammett, Johnny Depp among others and two months later, he made a surprise appearance during the Hollywood Vampires concert at O2 Arena in London. In 2024, he contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

==Other ventures==
===Artwork===

Wood is a well-known visual artist. When he was a child his drawings were featured on the BBC television programme &quot;Sketch Club&quot;; he won one of that programme&#x27;s competitions, an achievement he refers to as his &quot;awakening to art&quot;. He went on to train at the Ealing Art College, as had both his brothers. Other notable musicians such as Freddie Mercury of Queen and Pete Townshend of the Who also attended that college in the 1960s.

Wood&#x27;s paintings, drawings and prints frequently feature icons of popular culture and have been exhibited all over the world. He did the cover artwork to Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1988 box set &quot;Crossroads&quot;. Several of his paintings, including a work commissioned by Andrew Lloyd Webber, are displayed at London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre. Art critic Brian Sewell has called Wood &quot;an accomplished and respectable artist&quot;; and the &quot;South Bank Show&quot; has devoted an entire program to his artwork. Wood has maintained a long-standing relationship with the San Francisco Art Exchange, which first exhibited his work in 1987. Wood is also co-owner (along with sons Jamie and Tyrone) of a London art gallery called Scream.

To date, Wood has three books to his credit: a short collection of autobiographical anecdotes titled &quot;The Works&quot;, illustrated with Wood&#x27;s artwork, co-authored by Bill German and published in 1988; a limited-edition art book titled &quot;Wood on Canvas: Every Picture Tells a Story&quot;, published in 1998 by Genesis Publications; and his 2007 autobiography &quot;Ronnie&quot;, written in collaboration with his son-in-law Jack MacDonald and Jeffrey Robinson.

In addition to numerous Faces and Rolling Stones concert films, broadcasts and documentaries, Wood performed alongside the Band, Bob Dylan, and many others in the finale of the documentary &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, filmed in 1976. He has made cameo appearances in feature films, including &quot;The Deadly Bees&quot; (1967), &quot;The Wild Life&quot; (1984) and &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; (1986), as well as on television programs including &quot;The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash&quot; (1978). In October 2007, Wood appeared on the television motor show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, achieving a celebrity lap time of 1:49.4.

On 17 October 2017, his autobiography &quot;Ronnie Wood: Artist&quot; was published.

As a friend of Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, Wood starred in the eponymous documentary film &quot;Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan: The Edge of Everything&quot; (2023).

===Thoroughbred racing===
Wood has a long-standing interest in thoroughbred breeding and racing. One of his best-known horses, of which he is the breeder, is Sandymount Duke, who has competed in both flat and jump racing under trainer Jessica Harrington. In January 2019, it was announced that Sandymount Duke was being aimed at the Grand National at Aintree racecourse. However, a setback in training prevented the horse from taking its place in the field.

==Personal life==

Wood has six children. Jesse is his son with his first wife, Krissy (&quot;née&quot; Findlay), a former model to whom he was married from 1971 to 1978. During this time, he had an affair with Pattie Boyd, who had been married to George Harrison. Findlay died in 2005. In 1985 Wood married his second wife, Jo Wood (&quot;née&quot; Karslake), mother of his daughter Leah and son Tyrone. He also adopted Jamie, Jo Wood&#x27;s son from a previous relationship. In addition to his six children, Wood has six grandchildren.

Wood has been frank about his struggle with alcoholism; although reports between 2003 and 2006 had indicated that he had been sober since the Rolling Stones&#x27; 2002–03 tour, in June 2006 it was reported that he was entering rehab following a spell of increased alcohol abuse. Jagger was supportive of his sobriety efforts, though Richards was initially skeptical. By July 2008, &quot;ITN&quot; reported that Wood had checked himself into rehab a total of six times, the last time being before the wedding of his daughter, Leah. He had plans once again for a seventh admission. Wood also took up stamp collecting as part of his alcoholism rehab.

In July 2008, he left his wife for Katia Ivanova, whom he had met in a London club. Wood checked into rehab again on 16 July 2008. Jo Wood filed for divorce, which was granted in 2009.

On 3 December 2009, Wood was arrested over assault &quot;in connection with a domestic incident&quot;. He was cautioned for this offence on 22 December 2009.

On 21 December 2012, Wood married Sally Humphreys, the owner of a theatre production company, 31 years his junior. Their twin girls, named Gracie Jane and Alice Rose, were born on Monday 30 May 2016, just before Ronnie Wood&#x27;s 69th birthday on 1 June 2016.

Wood was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2017, necessitating the partial removal of one of his lungs. He said he refused chemotherapy because he did not want to lose his hair. In April 2021, Wood announced that he had been diagnosed with a small-cell cancer but that he had been deemed &quot;all-clear&quot; by his doctors following treatment.

In 2021, Wood stated that he had been sober for 10 years.

He is a fan of English EFL Championship football club West Bromwich Albion.

<text>Uzbekbaatar is a genus of extinct mammal from the Upper Cretaceous of Uzbekistan. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta, though its further affinities are unclear. The genus was named by Kielan-Jaworowska Z. and Nesov L.A. in 1992 and means &quot;Uzbek hero&quot;.

The one species named by Kielan-Jaworowska and Nesov is &quot;Uzbekbaatar kizylkumensis&quot;, found in the Upper Cretaceous strata of Uzbekistan. A second species was also apparently described by Averianov in 1999.

<text>Viridomys is a genus of extinct mammal from the Upper Cretaceous of North America. It was a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata, and lived during the Mesozoic, also known as the &quot;age of the dinosaurs.&quot; It&#x27;s within the suborder of Cimolodonta, though its further affinities are unclear.

The primary species, &quot;Viridomys orbatus&quot;, is known from fossils found in Campanian (Upper Cretaceous)-aged strata of the Upper Milk River Formation in Alberta, Canada. Possible remains have also been found in Dogie Mountain, Texas (United States). The Texas site is believed to be Paleocene in age.

<text>222 (two hundred [and] twenty-two) is the natural number following 221 and preceding 223.

== In mathematics ==
It is a decimal repdigit and a strobogrammatic number (meaning that it looks the same turned upside down on a calculator display). It is one of the numbers whose digit sum in decimal is the same as it is in binary.

222 is a noncototient, meaning that it cannot be written in the form &quot;n&quot; − φ(&quot;n&quot;) where φ is Euler&#x27;s totient function counting the number of values that are smaller than &quot;n&quot; and relatively prime to it.

There are exactly 222 distinct ways of assigning a meet and join operation to a set of ten unlabelled elements in order to give them the structure of a lattice, and exactly 222 different six-edge polysticks.

<text>Friedrich Maximilian von Klinger (17 February 1752 – 9 March 1831) was a German dramatist and novelist. His play &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; (1776) gave its name to the Sturm und Drang artistic epoch. He was a childhood friend of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and is often closely associated with Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz. Klinger worked as a playwright for the &quot;Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft&quot; for two years, but eventually left the Kingdom of Prussia to become a General in the Imperial Russian Army.

==Biography==
One of the few eighteenth-century authors from the lower social class, Klinger was born in Frankfurt am Main. His father, Johannes Klinger (1719–1760), was a town constable in Frankfurt who came from Pfaffen-Beerfurth in the Odenwald where he was born as the son of the mill owner, blacksmith and schoolmaster Johannes Klinger (1671–1743), who was married to Anna Barabra Boßler (1674–1747) since January 17, 1695. His father died when Klinger was eight years old, forcing his mother Cornelia Fuchs Klinger, a sergeant&#x27;s daughter, to support her son and two daughters by washing laundry from the Frankfurt eliteincluding, perhaps, Klinger&#x27;s future friends and patrons, the Goethes of Hirschgrabenallee. In spite of this misfortune, Klinger excelled in his studies and won a scholarship to study at the gymnasium, where he also worked as a tutor to earn money for his family.

Klinger was the cousin of Heinrich Philipp Boßler, who is known as the authorized original publisher of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.

Though there is little documentation of Klinger&#x27;s earliest interactions with Goethe during their Frankfurt years, they appear to have made acquaintance by 1773, as Klinger had begun work on his first dramas, &quot;Otto&quot; and &quot;Das leidende Weib&quot; (&quot;The Suffering Wife&quot;) which, according to his Leipzig publisher, owe a great debt to Goethe&#x27;s then-unpublished &quot;Götz von Berlichingen mit der eisernen Hand&quot;. Weygand released the collection at its Easter book fair of 1775, calling them &quot;plays in the Goethean/Lenzian Manner.&quot; Additionally, it was only with Goethe&#x27;s financial assistance that Klinger was able to enroll at the University of Gießen in 1774 where he briefly studied to be a legal clerk.

In 1776, Klinger submitted his tragedy &quot;Die Zwillinge&quot; (&quot;The Twins&quot;) to a contest hosted by the Hamburg theatre under the auspices of the actress Sophie Charlotte Ackermann and her son, the famous actor and playwright Friedrich Ludwig Schröder. The play took first prize, earning Klinger enough critical acclaim to be appointed Theaterdichter to the &quot;Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft&quot; headed by Abel Seyler and held this post for two years.

In 1778, he joined the Austrian military and fought in the War of the Bavarian Succession. In 1780, he went to Saint Petersburg, became an officer in the Imperial Russian Army, was ennobled and attached to the Grand Duke Paul, whom he accompanied on a journey to Italy and France. In 1785, he was appointed director of the corps of cadets, and after marrying Elizaveta Alekseyeva (rumored to be a natural daughter of Catherine the Great and Prince Grigory Orlov), was made praeses of the Academy of Knights in 1799. In 1803, Klinger was nominated by Emperor Alexander curator of the Universität Dorpat, an office he held until 1817. In 1811, he became lieutenant-general. He then gradually gave up his official posts, and after living for many years in retirement, died in the imperial city of Dorpat in present-day Estonia.

Klinger was a man of vigorous moral character and full of fine feeling, though the bitter experiences and deprivations of his youth are largely reflected in his dramas. It was one of his earliest works, &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; (1776), which gave its name to this artistic epoch. In addition to this tragedy and &quot;Die Zwillinge&quot; (1776), the chief plays of his early period of passionate fervour and restless &quot;storm and stress&quot; are &quot;Die neue Arria&quot; (1776), &quot;Simsone Grisaldo&quot; (1776) and &quot;Stilpo und seine Kinder&quot; (1780). To a later period belongs the fine double tragedy of &quot;Medea in Korinth&quot; and &quot;Medea auf dem Kaukasos&quot; (1791). In Russia, he devoted himself mainly to the writing of philosophical romances, of which the best known are &quot;Fausts Leben, Taten und Höllenfahrt&quot; (1791), &quot;Geschichte Giafars des Barmeciden&quot; (1792) and &quot;Geschichte Raphaeis de Aquillas&quot; (1793). This series was closed in 1803 with &quot;Betrachtungen und Gedanken über verschiedene Gegenstände der Welt und der Literatur&quot;. In these works, Klinger gives calm and dignified expression to the leading ideas which the period of Sturm und Drang had bequeathed to German classical literature.

==Works==
*&quot;Faustus&quot;
*Review of Klinger&#x27;s Faust 1890
*&quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;

==Bibliography==
Klingers works were published in twelve volumes (1809–1815), also 1832–1833 and 1842. The most recent edition is in eight volumes (1878–1880); but none of these is complete. A selection will be found in A. Sauer, &quot;Stürmer und Dränger&quot;, vol. 1. (1883). See E. Schmidt, &quot;Lenz und Klinger&quot; (1878); M. Rieger, &quot;Klinger in der Sturm-und Drangperiode&quot; (1880); and &quot;Klinger in seiner Reife&quot; (1896).

<text>A baby bottle, nursing bottle, or feeding bottle is a bottle with a &quot;teat&quot; (also called a &quot;nipple&quot; in the US) attached to it, which creates the ability to drink via suckling. It is typically used by infants and young children, or if someone cannot (without difficulty) drink from a cup, for feeding oneself or being fed. It can also be used to feed non-human mammals, whose mother cannot feed their young or mammals which have no mother.

Hard plastic is the most common material used, being transparent, light-weight, and resistant to breakage. Glass bottles have been recommended as being easier to clean, less likely to retain formula residues, and relatively chemically inert. Hybrid bottles using plastic on the outside and glass inside have also been developed. Other materials used for baby bottles include food-grade stainless steel and silicone rubber.

Baby bottles can be used to feed expressed breast milk, infant formula, or pediatric electrolyte solution. A 2020 review reports that healthy term infants, when breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, &quot;use similar tongue and jaw movements, can create suction and sequentially use teat compression to obtain milk, with minimal differences in oxygen saturation and SSB patterns&quot; (suck–swallow–breath patterns). Sick or pre-term babies may not be able to breastfeed or take a bottle effectively and may need specialized care.

The design characteristics of the bottle and teat have been found to affect infant feeding and milk intake. Interactions between the infant and the caregiver feeding them affect the infant&#x27;s milk intake during feeding. Whether the caregiver or the infant controls the feeding appears to affect the infant&#x27;s ability to learn to self-regulate their milk intake.

Proper cleaning and sterilization of bottles are recommended to avoid bacterial contamination and illness, particularly in areas where water quality and sanitary conditions are not good.

==Design considerations==

A typical baby bottle typically has four components: the first is the main container or body of the bottle. A &quot;teat&quot;, or &quot;nipple&quot;, is the flexible part of the bottle that the baby will suck from, and contains a hole through which the milk will flow. The &quot;collar&quot; goes over the nipple and typically screws onto the neck of the bottle, forming a seal. Most, but not all baby bottles will also have a &quot;cap&quot; or &quot;travel cover&quot; that goes over the teat to keep it clean and to prevent small spills.
Some bottles may optionally have a disposable liner.

Design concerns for the making of baby bottles often reflect safety or comfort.
A safe baby bottle should not break, should not come apart easily into small or potentially harmful components, should not be made of materials that pose a health risk, and should be easy to clean so as to avoid bacterial contamination and illness.

A bottle should also be comfortable for both caregiver and baby to use. Bottles that are lightweight and easy to hold can be desired by both babies and mothers. A variety of shapes are available. The design of containers, nipples or teats may mimic the shape of the mother&#x27;s breast. Designers may try to mimic the flow rate of breastfeeding: the baby should be able to get enough nourishment, but at the same time not be overwhelmed or overfed.

=== Materials ===
Over time a wide variety of materials have been used for infant feeding vessels (see &quot;History&quot;). The materials now most commonly used in baby bottle containers are glass and some types of plastics. Food-grade stainless steel and silicone rubber are also used. Each of these four materials—plastic, glass, silicone and stainless steel—has advantages and disadvantages. The standard materials used in teats/nipples are latex rubber and silicone.

A number of countries have regulations about allowable food contact materials. Ideally, the material making up the bottle should react as little as possible with the material in the bottle. No material is completely inert, but glass and stainless steel are relatively neutral materials which tend to remain stable and not interact with foods. The disadvantages of glass are that it tends to be heavy and can break more easily.

Plastics are lightweight and resistant to breaking. Manufacturers find them easy to form into a variety of shapes. A wide variety of plastics have been developed, some of which are not well understood in terms of reactivity. Some plastics have been found to be reactive with fluids such as breast milk and infant formula. Chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) may &quot;leach&quot; from a bottle into the substance it holds. In addition, plastics may be more likely to break down when heated or cooled, for example, when being heated in a microwave or being boiled to sterilize them.

Polycarbonate plastic was frequently used in baby bottles before 2011, and is still used in some countries. Polycarbonates contain Bisphenol A. Since 2008, at least 40 countries have banned the use of plastics containing Bisphenol A in baby bottles due to safety concerns (see &quot;Regulation&quot;). Bottles made of polycarbonate may be marked as &quot;#7 PC&quot;.

Bisphenol S (BPS) and Bisphenol F (BPF) have been used as substitutes for BPA. They are structurally similar. Comparisons of BPA, BPS and BPF have found that these chemicals have similar potency and action to BPA and may pose similar dangers in terms of endocrine-disrupting effects. 
This has led to criticisms of the chemical industry and for calls to deal with bisphenols in groups, not individually. In 2021, the Canadian government agencies Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Health Canada (HC) held consultations with the goal of grouping 343 known BPA analogs and functional alternatives.

Polyethersulfone plastic (PES) does not contain BPA but does include Bisphenol S (BPS). An assessment of a variety of different baby bottles in use in 2016, reported 4 bottles to be of &quot;high concern&quot;, 14 bottles to be of &quot;concern&quot;; and only 6 bottles to be of &quot;no concern&quot; These of &quot;no concern&quot; included two polyamide (PA) and two polyethersulfone (PES) bottles, a stainless steel bottle, and one of the 17 polypropylene (PP) bottles tested.

Phthalates, found in polyvinyl chloride (PVC), are another area of concern. Referred to as &quot;everywhere chemicals&quot; because they are so common, phthalates make plastic more flexible, and have been used in pacifiers and nipples or teats for bottles. 
Phthalates have been banned from use in feeding bottles in the EU. In the USA, there have been repeated calls for the removal of phthalates by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and others. Their use in children&#x27;s toys and products was somewhat restricted by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008. Plastics labeled #3 may leach phthalates.
Latex rubber nipples may contain phthalates, so silicone nipples may be recommended instead. Packaging may indicate whether a product is &quot;BPA-free&quot; or &quot;phthalate-free&quot;.

Plastics may degrade over time in other ways, There are concerns that small beads of plastic may be released into fluids from some types of plastic bottles. In 2020 researchers reported that infant feeding bottles made out of polypropylene caused microplastics exposure to infants ranging from 14,600 to 4,550,000 particles per capita per day in 48 regions with contemporary preparation procedures. Microplastics release is higher with warmer liquids and similar with other polypropylene products such as lunchboxes.
In 2022, the first study to examine the presence of plastic polymers in human blood found plastics of multiple types in the blood samples of 17 out of 22 healthy adults tested (nearly 80%).
Medical experts have suggested reducing exposure to microplastics by not shaking plastic bottles or exposing them to high temperatures. Some recommend using alternative materials such as glass, silicone, or stainless steel.

Baby bottle nipples (also called teats) are typically made from either silicone or latex rubber. When used for nipples, silicone is clear, durable, and slightly harder than latex. Natural rubber latex teats are elastic, tear resistant, and may feel softer. Latex can absorb odors, while silicone does not. Latex can break down if exposed to sunlight. Some people have allergies to latex.

=== Size ===
Bottles tend to come in standard sizes, often 
 and . 
Smaller bottles may be lighter and easier to hold and are often used with younger, smaller infants. There are concerns that larger bottles may lead to over-feeding, since parents are likely to encourage a baby to &quot;finish&quot; a bottle during a feeding.

The height-to-width ratio of bottles is high (relative to adult cups) because it is needed to ensure the contents flood the teat when used at normal angles; otherwise the baby will drink air. However, if the bottle is too tall, it easily tips. There are asymmetric bottles that ensure the contents flood the teat if the bottle is held at a certain direction.

=== Shape ===
The shape of the bottle is related to both ease of use and ease of cleaning (see &quot;History&quot;). Designers sometimes suggest that naturalistic designs will mean that babies can transition between breast or bottle without issues. Other bottles have been invented with unique shapes designed to speed up the warming and cooling of breast milk, saving time, reducing bacterial growth, and reducing exposure to temperatures that can damage the nutrients in breast milk.

&quot;Anti-colic&quot; bottles have been put forward with the goal of reducing &quot;gassiness&quot; and distress when feeding. Designs often seek to minimize the sucking in of air by the baby while feeding. Some bottles try to minimize the mixing of air into the milk within the bottle. At the same time, it is desirable to avoid creating an internal vacuum as the infant sucks out fluids, since this will make it harder to feed. Designs may rely on the bottle&#x27;s shape or incorporate different types of &quot;venting&quot;.
Some vented bottles, as well as bottles which use a collapsible liner collapses as the formula is drained, have been assessed favorably. They were reported to be comparable to a breastfeeding group in terms of milk intake, sucking patterns, and oxygenation.

A 2012 study comparing two types of vented bottles with anti-vacuum features found no differences in infant growth between randomized groups. &quot;Bottle A&quot;, a partial anti-vacuum design, was rated by parents as easier to assemble and clean. Infants fed using &quot;Bottle A&quot; were reported to engage in less &quot;fussing&quot;, but no difference were found in &quot;crying&quot; or &quot;colic&quot; or in rates of ear infection.

Health recommendations for the storage and handling of human milk typically focus on preventing the growth of dangerous bacteria, but some research is also being done on nutrition. Experimental studies have shown a degradation of retinol (Vitamin A) and α-Tocopherol (Vitamin E) content dependent upon the formation of bubbles in expressed breast milk and in formula. Seven models of bottles were studied, from six companies. Less degradation occurred when using a bottle feeding system designed to minimize the mixing of air with the bottle&#x27;s contents.

===Teat flow rate===
Teat characteristics can also have important implications for infant&#x27;s sucking pattern and milk intake. Milk flow rate is defined as &quot;the rate at which milk moves from the bottle nipple into the infant&#x27;s mouth during bottle-feeding.&quot; Characteristics such as the shape of the nipple and the way it is perforated may impact flow rate and the coordination of sucking, swallowing and breathing during feeding.

Unfortunately, categorization and labeling of teats to indicate flow rate is neither standardized nor consistent. There is significant variability between and within brands and models. In one study, nipples labeled &quot;Slow&quot; or &quot;Newborn&quot; (0–3 months) had flow rates ranging from 1.68 mL/min to 15.12 mL/min.&quot;The name assigned to the nipple type does not provide clear information to parents attempting to choose a nipple&quot;. This may be of extra concern in the case of fragile infants. Specialized teats are available for infants with cleft palate.

===Variations and accessories===
Bottles may be designed to attach directly to a breast pump for a complete &quot;feeding system&quot; that maximizes the reuse of the components. Such systems include a variety of drinking spouts for when the child is older. This converts the bottle into a sippy cup, a cup with lid and spout for toddlers, which is intermediate between a baby bottle and an open top cup. Bottles that are part of a feeding system may include handles that can be attached. The ring and teat may be replaced by a storage lid.

Accessories for bottles include cleaning brushes, or bottle brushes, sterilizers, and drying racks. Brushes may be specially designed for a specific manufacturer&#x27;s bottles and teats. Bottle sterilizers use different techniques for sterilization, including ultraviolet light, boiling water, and hot steam.

Bottle warmers warm previously made and refrigerated formula. Coolers designed to fit a specific manufacturer&#x27;s bottles are available to keep refrigerated formula cold. Special formula powder containers are available to store pre-measured amounts of formula so that caregivers can pre-fill bottles with sterile water and mix in the powder easily. The containers are typically designed to stack together so that multiple pre-measured amounts of formula powder may be transported as a unit.

Institutions can purchase ready-to-feed formula in containers that can be used as baby bottles. The lid screws off and is replaced by a disposable teat when the formula is ready to be used. This avoids storing the formula with the teat and possibly clogging the teat holes when formula is splashed within the bottle and dries.

== Use ==

===Cleaning and sterilization===
Sterilization is a standard practice to prevent development of bacteria and resulting illness, that is more effective than sanitization. The Australian government and the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Health Service guidelines recommend sterilization of baby bottles and other equipment either by using a cold water sterilizing solution such as by Milton sterilizing fluid, by steam sterilizing, or by boiling. It is important to clean and sterilize all parts of a bottle including containers, teats, and screw caps.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suggests that it may be sufficient to clean bottles with soap and water, in a dishwasher or by hand. This recommendation is based on the assumption that water supplies are clean and sanitation standards are high. 
Some states, such as Illinois, continue to recommend sterilization in addition to washing. Alberta, Canada recommends sterilizing bottles until an infant is at least 4 months old.

However, there is evidence that bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot; can thrive in biofilms which form on the interior walls of the bottles. Gentle rinsing is not enough to prevent this. Even in developed areas, contamination continues to be a concern. In 2009 in the United Kingdom, researchers found contamination with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; in 4% of the baby bottles that parents reported were ready to fill after cleaning and disinfecting.

In lower-resource settings, risks of exposure to dangerous respiratory and enteric infections are higher.
A study of children admitted to hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, found that 52.1% of the bottles their caregivers considered clean were actually contaminated. This occurred even though caregivers reportedly followed many of the recommended cleaning practices for cleaning and sterilizing bottles. The most common mistake was to boil the bottles for less than the minimum time recommended by WHO.

Research into the preparation of infant formula in South Korea indicates significant levels of contamination can be transmitted through the handling of spoons and other utensils. Spoons, after being touched, were often left in the formula container, allowing bacteria to spread to the formula in the container. &quot;C. sakazakii&quot;, &quot;S. enterica,&quot; and &quot;S. aureus&quot;, all of which are potentially fatal, were able to surviving for weeks in contaminated infant formula.

Understanding how recommendations are interpreted is important: in one study, leaving a bottle in water that had been previously boiled in a kettle was believed to be &quot;boiling&quot; the bottle. Researchers emphasize that health providers need to better educate caregivers; and that practical methods of bottle hygiene need to be suited to use in field settings. 
For example, in Peru, easy-to-adopt practices like using a bottle brush and detergent gave greater advantages than difficult-to-achieve procedures like boiling a bottle. WHO (which strongly recommends breastfeeding) notes that in cases where bottle feeding is to occur, much better education is needed on how to use bottles.

=== Age-appropriate use ===
Nipples (teats) are typically subdivided by flow rate, with the slowest flow rate recommended for premature infants and infants with feeding difficulties. However, flow rates are not standardised and vary considerably between brands.

The NHS recommends a sippy cup or beaker be introduced by 6 months and the use of bottles discontinued by 1 year. The AAP recommends that the cup be introduced by one year of age and that the use of the bottle by discontinued by 18 months.
The use of bottles is discouraged beyond two years of age by most health organisations as prolonged use can cause tooth decay. Early childhood caries (ECC) is also a concern when considering how long breastfeeding should continue.

==Regulation==
While infant formula is highly regulated in many countries, baby bottles are not. Only the materials of the teat and bottle itself are specifically regulated in some countries (e.g. British Standards BS 7368:1990 &quot;Specification for babies&#x27; elastomeric feeding bottle teats&quot;). 
In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates teats and the bottle materials.

In 1985 the FDA restricted allowable levels of nitrosamines (many of which are carcinogens) released from bottle teats. Tests of bottle nipples available in the USA, Singapore, West Germany, England, Japan and Korea suggest that levels of nitrosamines in most rubber baby bottle teats are within recommended standards.

Another chemical that has been regulated is Bisphenol A (BPA), described as an endocrine disruptor in 1991. Ongoing research into the possible effects of BPA at levels of exposure far below the U.S. government&#x27;s BPA safety standards has led to concerns about the safety of plastics, including baby bottles. A 1999 &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; study showed that some polycarbonate baby bottles released unsafe amounts of BPA.
Concerns about BPA have been supported by further work.
(Research into the effects of BPA has frequently been hotly contested and controversial and issues have been raised over research biases due to industry funding and conflicts of interest due to close ties between government consultants and BPA manufacturers.) One result has been proposals to change the testing paradigm for assessment of endocrine-disrupting chemicals.

Research and public pressure have led to bans on the use of Bisphenol A in bottles and cups to be used by children. In 2008 Walmart announced that it would stop selling baby bottles and food containers containing BPA.
As of 2017, these were applied in at least 40 countries.
Canada classified BPA as &quot;toxic&quot; in 2008 under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
In 2011 use of bisphenol A in baby bottles was forbidden in all EU countries, in China, in Malaysia, and South Africa.
In July 2012, the FDA stated that BPA would no longer used in baby bottles and sippy cups, in response to a petition from the American Chemistry Council stating that this was now in line with industry practice. Other countries such as Argentina and Brazil followed suit by prohibiting bisphenol A in baby bottles. Korea has extended its BPA ban to include all children&#x27;s utensils, containers and packaging as of January 2020.
There are calls for increased regulation of BPA in India.

==History==
Throughout most of human history, infant nutrition has primarily depended on the availability of the child&#x27;s mother or a wet nurse to breastfeed the infant. Beliefs and behaviors relating to infant feeding also vary widely across countries, cultures and times. Mothers and caregivers have also sought additional ways to feed children, sometimes referred to as &quot;hand feeding&quot;. As early as , Egyptian pottery shows images of women breastfeeding their babies and also using animal horns to feed them.
Containers with hard spouts date to early in recorded time, as evidence by archeological finds &quot;(see image)&quot;. The first vessels known to be used for feeding infants had an opening at one end for filling the bottle, and a second at the other to be put into the baby&#x27;s mouth. 
Examination of the organic residues on ancient ceramic baby bottles shows that they were used as early as to feed babies with animal milk.

Around to the Egyptians developed the ability to blow glass and the Romans blew clear feeding bottles of glass, but these did not obtain long-term popularity. Leather and wood were also used. 

By the 1700s infant-feeding vessels such as the feeding-cups, bubby-pots, and sucking-pots were also being made from materials that included pewter, tin, and silver.
In the 19th century, artificial feeding begin to replace wet nursing, and by 1900, wet nursing no longer existed as an organized profession. Changes to the feeding of infants were both socially and technologically driven. With industrialization, more mothers worked outside the home and could less easily breastfeed their children. Technological changes including the design of artificial feeding methods and the preparation of animal milks and other milk substitutes supported a transition to artificial feeding, but with mixed success. Understanding of both nutrition and sanitation lagged behind the introduction of artificial feeding methods, contributing to extremely high infant mortality rates in the Victorian era.
In the United States, the first glass nursing bottle was patented by C.M. Windship in 1841. It was intentionally shaped like the mother&#x27;s breast. In 1845 the Alexandra Feeder was marketed in England. In Paris, the &quot;Biberon&quot; was introduced by M. Darbo: it was reported to be quite popular in a review from 1851.
As the group &quot;American Collectors of Infant Feeders&quot; notes, by &quot;the late 1800s a large variety of glass nursing bottles were produced in the United States&quot;, and the U.S. Patent Office had issued more than 200 patents for various designs of nursing bottles by the 1940s—designed to lie flat or stand up straight, with openings on their sides or ends, with detachable or permanently attached nipples, etc.
The design of baby bottles and particularly the ease of cleaning them had potentially serious consequences for the health of the children using them. Estimates of infant mortality suggest that 20-30% of infants died in the first year of life during the late Victorian era. During the 1890s, at a time when England&#x27;s childhood mortality rates (ages 1-5) were declining, infant mortality rates actually rose. A bottle with a long Indian rubber tube ending in a teat remained popular until the 1920s because even very young babies could feed independently. The feeding tubes could be bought separately and were sometimes used with empty whiskey or medicine bottles. Almost impossible to keep clean, this type has been nicknamed the &quot;murder bottle&quot;.
Allen and Hanbury introduced a new bottle design with a removable valve and teat on the two ends in 1894, and an improved model, the Allenbury, in 1900. This &quot;banana&quot; bottle was easier to clean. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;hygienic bottle&quot;, it helped to improve survival rates. Similar bottles were introduced by other manufacturers and remained popular from the 1900s to the 1950s. Eventually increased understanding of the causes and transmission of disease and improvements in medicine and public health began to reduce infant mortality.

Heat-resistant Pyrex bottles were introduced to the American and British markets at different times. Pyrex bottles were first introduced in the United States by Corning Inc. in 1922. They were offered in three shapes (narrow neck, wide mouth, and flat) and multiple sizes, for a total of ten varieties. By 1925, the product line had been limited to a small subset of the original shapes and sizes.
In the 1950s a upright Pyrex bottle with a narrow neck was introduced. In the 1960s a wide-neck version was finally introduced to the UK market. The design of upright bottles with a wider mouth meant that they could be more easily cleaned, and sterilized in batches.

Soft nipples of various materials were introduced early in the history of feeding (e.g., leather, cork, sponge, dried cow&#x27;s teat filled with cloth). Many were very difficult to clean and when unsanitary could pose a serious threat to infant health.
Although Elijah Pratt of New York patented the first rubber nipple in 1845, it took until the 20th century before materials and technology improved sufficiently to allow manufacture of a soft nipple that was practical for use. The invention of rubber (1840s) provided a material that was soft. Early black Indian rubber &quot;had a very strong pungent smell&quot;, and did not survive repeated exposures to hot water. However, by the early 1900s more pleasing rubber nipples could be manufactured in volume and could withstand the heat of sterilization.

During the 1940s nurse Adda M. Allen filed for multiple patents relating to the design of baby bottles, including the first disposable collapsible liner for a baby bottle.
Her patent was one of many attempts to design a bottle to limit swallowing of air during feeding, and reduce gastric upset and spitting up. A plastic bottle with a disposable liner was eventually tested at George Washington University Hospital and marketed by Playtex.

Innovations such as the introduction of a working check valve in the nipple (to provide unidirectional flow of the liquid food) appeared as early as 1948 in a patent to J.W. Less. This technology was picked up by others including Owens-Illinois Glass, eventually making its way into Gerber and all modern pressure-balancing bottle designs. It is also used for adult drinking cups and various other products requiring fluid flow under vacuum.

The modern business of producing bottles in the developed world is substantial. For 2018, the global baby bottle market was valued at 2.6 billion USD.
In 1999 it was reported that the UK &quot;feeding and sterilising equipment sector ... stands at £49m… [where] [s]ales of feeding bottles account for 39%&quot; or £19.1m of that market.

==Controversy==
The 2014 summary policy statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) makes no specific mention of bottle feeding, but makes clear that &quot;[b]reastfeeding and human milk are the normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition&quot;, and refers to decisions regarding the supply of infant nutrition as &quot;a public health issue and not only a lifestyle choice… [g]iven the documented short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding&quot;. The AAP policy recommends breastfeeding exclusively for six months, continuing it with introduction of complementary foods, with an overall duration of &quot;1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant&quot;. The body of the policy statement notes and cites literature indicating that, in addition to the importance of mother&#x27;s milk, the manner of the food delivery has implications: that &quot;breastfed infants self-regulate intake volume&quot;, whereas bottle-fed infants receiving expressed breast milk or formula have &quot;increased bottle emptying, poorer self-regulation, and excessive weight gain in late infancy&quot;, and that such early practice of self-regulation correlate with adult patterns of weight gain (ibid.).

The AAP policy notes that &quot;[m]edical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare&quot;. The transmission of some viral diseases through breastfeeding is reportedly preventable, e.g., by expressing breast milk and subjecting it to Holder pasteurization.

In response to public pressure felt from policies de-emphasizing bottle- and formula-feeding, efforts have arisen to support mothers experiencing physiologic or other difficulties in breastfeeding, and sites include individual views that attempt to weaken the scientific case of the AAP policy; a book of the personal experiences and views of one mother committed to bottle/formula feeding, &quot;Bottled Up&quot;, by Suzanne Barston, has appeared.

In 2007, a group of 38 researchers examined 700 studies into the use of the chemical compound Bisphenol A in plastics manufacturing, and warned that very low levels of exposure to the chemical can potentially pose adverse health effects, especially to a developing fetus. In 2024, multiple baby bottle companies, including Nuk, Tommee Tippee, and Dr. Brown&#x27;s, were involved in a class action lawsuit for their bottles leaching microplastics when heated.

<text>The Plain Dealer is a Restoration comedy by William Wycherley, first performed on 11 December 1676. The play is based on Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Misanthrope&quot;, and is generally considered Wycherley&#x27;s finest work along with &quot;The Country Wife&quot;.

The play was highly praised by John Dryden and John Dennis, though it was equally condemned for its obscenity by many. Throughout the eighteenth century it was performed in a bowdlerised version by Isaac Bickerstaffe.

The title character is Captain Manly, a sailor who doubts the motives of everyone he meets except for his sweetheart, Olivia, and his friend, Vernish. When Olivia jilts him and marries Vernish, he attempts to gain revenge by sending a pageboy (who, unknown to him, is a girl named Fidelia in disguise and is in love with him) to seduce Olivia. When the truth of the page&#x27;s identity is discovered, Manly marries her instead.

The French philosopher, historian, and dramatist Voltaire adapted &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; to make his own play, titled &quot;La Prude&quot; (The Prude).

<text>Joseph Cornell (December 24, 1903 – December 29, 1972) was an American visual artist and filmmaker, one of the pioneers and most celebrated exponents of assemblage. Influenced by the Surrealists, he was also an avant-garde experimental filmmaker. He was largely self-taught in his artistic efforts, and improvised his own original style incorporating cast-off and discarded artifacts. He lived most of his life in relative physical isolation, caring for his mother and his disabled brother at home, but remained aware of and in contact with other contemporary artists.

==Life==
Joseph Cornell was born in Nyack, New York, to Joseph Cornell, a textiles industry executive, and Helen Ten Broeck Storms Cornell, who had trained as a nursery teacher. Both parents came from socially prominent families of Dutch ancestry, long-established in New York State. Cornell&#x27;s father died April 30, 1917, leaving the family in straitened circumstances. Following the elder Cornell&#x27;s death, his widow and children moved to the borough of Queens in New York City. Cornell attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in the class of 1921. Although he reached the senior year, he did not graduate. Following this, he returned to live with his family.

Except for the three-and-a-half years he spent at Phillips, he lived for most of his life in a small, wood-frame house on Utopia Parkway in a working-class area of Flushing, along with his mother and his brother Robert, whom cerebral palsy had rendered physically disabled. Aside from his time at Andover, Cornell never traveled beyond the New York City area.

==Art practice==
===Sculpture and collage===
Cornell&#x27;s most characteristic art works were boxed assemblages created from found objects. These are simple shadow boxes, usually fronted with a glass pane, in which he arranged eclectic fragments of photographs or Victorian , in a way that combines the formal austerity of Constructivism with the lively fantasy of Surrealism. Many of his boxes, such as the famous &quot;Medici Slot Machine&quot; boxes, are interactive and are meant to be handled.

Like Kurt Schwitters, Cornell could create poetry from the commonplace. Unlike Schwitters, however, he was fascinated not by refuse, garbage, and the discarded, but by fragments of once beautiful and precious objects he found on his frequent trips to the bookshops and thrift stores of New York. His boxes relied on the Surrealist use of irrational juxtaposition, and on the evocation of nostalgia, for their appeal.

Cornell often made series of boxed assemblages that reflected his various interests: the &quot;Soap Bubble Sets&quot;, the &quot;Medici Slot Machine&quot; series, the &quot;Pink Palace&quot; series, the &quot;Hotel&quot; series, the &quot;Observatory&quot; series, and the &quot;Space Object Boxes&quot;, among others. Also captivated with birds, Cornell created an &quot;Aviary&quot; series of boxes, in which colorful images of various birds were mounted on wood, cut out, and set against harsh white backgrounds.

In addition to creating boxes and flat collages and making short art films, Cornell also kept a filing system of over 160 visual-documentary &quot;dossiers&quot; on themes that interested him; the dossiers served as repositories from which Cornell drew material and inspiration for boxes like his &quot;penny arcade&quot; portrait of Lauren Bacall. He had no formal training in art, although he was extremely well-read and was conversant with the New York art scene from the 1940s through to the 1960s.

His methodology is described in a monograph by Charles Simic as:


In his later years, Cornell utilized the help of assistants to create his artworks. These assistants included both local art students and practicing artists such as Larry Jordan and Terry Shutté. He greatly enjoyed working with young artists and teaching them his methods and art practices.

===Experimental film===

Joseph Cornell&#x27;s 1936 found-film montage &quot;Rose Hobart&quot; was made entirely from splicing together existing film stock that Cornell had found in New Jersey warehouses, mostly derived from a 1931 &quot;B&quot; film entitled &quot;East of Borneo&quot;. Cornell would play Nestor Amaral&#x27;s record &quot;Holiday in Brazil&quot; during its rare screenings, as well as projecting the film through a deep blue glass or filter, giving the film a dreamlike effect. Focusing mainly on the gestures and expressions made by Rose Hobart (the original film&#x27;s starlet), this dreamscape of Cornell&#x27;s seems to exist in a kind of suspension until the film&#x27;s most arresting sequence toward the end, when footage of a solar eclipse is juxtaposed with a white ball falling into a pool of water in slow motion.

Cornell premiered the film at the Julien Levy Gallery in December 1936 during the first Surrealist exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. Salvador Dalí, who was in New York to attend the MoMA opening, was present at its first screening. During the screening, Dalí became outraged at Cornell&#x27;s movie, claiming he had just had the same idea of applying collage techniques to film. After the screening, Dalí remarked to Cornell that he should stick to making boxes and stop making films. Traumatized by this event, the shy, retiring Cornell showed his films rarely thereafter.

Joseph Cornell continued to experiment with film until his death in 1972. While his earlier films were often collages of found short films, his later ones montaged together footage he expressly commissioned from the professional filmmakers with whom he collaborated. These latter films were often set in some of Cornell&#x27;s favorite neighborhoods and landmarks in New York City: Mulberry Street, Bryant Park, Union Square Park, and the Third Avenue Elevated Railway, among others.

In 1969 Cornell gave a collection of both his own films and the works of others to Anthology Film Archives in New York City.

==Art market==
Sold from the estate of Edwin and Lindy Bergman, Chicago-based collectors and art patrons, Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Untitled (Penny Arcade Portrait of Lauren Bacall)&quot; (1946) fetched $5.3 million at Christie&#x27;s New York, setting an auction record for the artist. The jewel-like box, with images of Bacall on blue background, was inspired by &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;, a film starring Bacall and Humphrey Bogart.

==Personal life==
Cornell was wary of strangers. This led him to isolate himself and become a self-taught artist. Although he expressed attraction to unattainable women like Lauren Bacall, his shyness made romantic relationships almost impossible. In later life his bashfulness verged toward reclusiveness, and he rarely left the state of New York. However, he preferred talking with women, and often made their husbands wait in the next room when he discussed business with them. He also had numerous friendships with ballerinas, who found him unique, but too eccentric to be a romantic partner.

He devoted his life to caring for his younger brother Robert, who was disabled and lived with cerebral palsy, which was another factor in his lack of relationships. At some point in the 1920s, or possibly earlier, he read the writings of Mary Baker Eddy, including &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot;. Cornell considered Eddy&#x27;s works to be among the most important books ever published after the Bible, and he became a lifelong Christian Science adherent. Christian Science belief and practice informed Cornell&#x27;s art deeply, as art historian Sandra Leonard Starr has shown.

He was also rather poor for most of his life, working during the 1920s as a wholesale fabric salesman to support his family. As a result of the American Great Depression, Cornell lost his textile industry job in 1931, and worked for a short time thereafter as a door-to-door appliance salesman. During this time, through her friendship with Ethel Traphagen, Cornell&#x27;s mother secured him a part-time position designing textiles. In the 1940s, Cornell also worked in a plant nursery (which would figure in his famous dossier &quot;GC44&quot;) and briefly in a defense plant, and designed covers and feature layouts for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;View&quot;, &quot;Dance Index&quot;, and other magazines. He only really began to sell his boxes for significant sums after his 1949 solo show at the Charles Egan Gallery.

Cornell eventually began a passionate, but platonic, relationship with Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama while she was living in New York in the mid-1960s. She was twenty-six years his junior; they would call each other daily, sketch each other, and he would send personalized collages to her. Their lengthy association lasted even after her return to Japan, ending only with his death in 1972.

==Death==
Cornell&#x27;s brother Robert died in 1965, and his mother in 1966. Joseph Cornell died of apparent heart failure on December 29, 1972, a few days after his sixty-ninth birthday. The executors of his estate were Richard Ader and Wayne Andrews, as represented by the art dealers Leo Castelli, Richard Feigen, and James Corcoran. Later, the Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation was established, which administers the copyrights of Cornell&#x27;s works and represents the interests of his heirs. Currently, the Foundation is administered by Trustees Richard Ader and Joseph Erdman.

==In popular culture==
*Anne Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Celestial Navigation&quot; (1974) is a fictional riff on being Joseph Cornell.
*The cyberpunk novelist William Gibson uses the finding of mysterious boxes similar to those by Joseph Cornell as a narrative element in his novel &quot;Count Zero&quot; (1984).
*The Dutch pop band The Nits released a song, &quot;Soap Bubble Box&quot;, on their 1992 album &quot;Ting&quot;, about seeing some of Cornell&#x27;s boxes in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The song was a minor hit in the Netherlands.
*Scholarship on Joseph Cornell’s art and life led to Michael Brayndick’s dissertation &quot;Joseph Cornell and the Dialectics of Human Time;&quot; and inspired Brayndick&#x27;s 1999 play, &quot;How to Make a Rainbow&quot;, with workshop performances in: New York (1998), Connecticut (2000), and the UK (2003), and the world premiere production by On the Spot Theatre at the Greenhouse Theater Center in Chicago (2013).
*In 1992, poet Charles Simic published a prose collection inspired by and with images of the work of Joseph Cornell: &quot;Dime-Store Alchemy: The Art of Joseph Cornell&quot; (published by New York Review Books, originally published by Hopewell, N.J.: Ecco Press).
*Singer-songwriter Mary Chapin Carpenter imagines Cornell going about his creative life in the song &quot;Ideas Are Like Stars&quot;, on her 1996 album &quot;A Place in the World&quot;.
*The English band The Clientele has a song titled &quot;Joseph Cornell&quot; on the group&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Suburban Light&quot;.
*Jonathan Safran Foer&#x27;s anthology &quot;A Convergence of Birds&quot; (2001) is a collection of fiction and poetry inspired by Cornell&#x27;s work. Foer, then an undergraduate, solicited all of his favorite authors to contribute to the collection by sending each of them a print of one of Cornell&#x27;s bird boxes, and an explanation of the project. He was surprised when well-known authors such as Joyce Carol Oates, Rick Moody and Barry Lopez responded to his prompts with Cornell-inspired works.
*The American novelist and short story writer Robert Coover published a series of stories entitled &quot;The Grand Hotels (of Joseph Cornell)&quot; in 2002. Akin to short fables, the stories refer to various themes and images in Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Hotel&quot; series of boxes.
*Charles L. Mee&#x27;s play &quot;Hotel Cassiopeia&quot; (2006) is based on the life of Joseph Cornell.
*Singer/songwriter Thomas Comerford released the album &quot;Archive + Spiral&quot; in 2011 which contains the song titled &quot;Joseph Cornell&quot;. The song is described as less of an homage and more of a meditation on the mood the artist invokes.

<doc id="216639" wikidata="Q133234" url="?curid=216639" title="Gondwanatheria">
<text>Gondwanatheria is an extinct group of mammaliaforms that lived in parts of Gondwana, including Madagascar, India, South America, Africa, and Antarctica during the Upper Cretaceous through the Miocene (and possibly much earlier, if &quot;Allostaffia&quot; is a member of this group). Until recently, they were known only from fragmentary remains. They are generally considered to be closely related to the multituberculates and likely the euharamiyidians, well known from the Northern Hemisphere, with which they form the clade Allotheria.

== Classification ==

For several decades the affinities of the group were not clear, being first interpreted as early xenarthrans, or &quot;toothless&quot; mammals similar to the modern anteater. A variety of studies have placed them as allotheres related to multituberculates, possibly even true multituberculates, closer to cimolodonts than &quot;plagiaulacidans&quot; are. However, a more recent study recovered them as nested among haramiyidans, rendering them as non-mammalian cynodonts. A more recently described specimen has since recovered them as allotheres closely related to multituberculates, but this was soon after followed by a study recovering them as part of Euharamiyida, which itself was placed inside crown-group Mammalia.

There are three known families within Gondwanatheria. The family Sudamericidae was named by Scillato-Yané and Pascual in 1984, and includes the vast majority of named taxa. The family Ferugliotheriidae was named by José Bonaparte in 1986, and includes one genus, &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, and possibly a few other forms like &quot;Trapalcotherium&quot; from the Late Cretaceous of South America. Ferugliotheriidae are considered the most basal gondawanatherians, and are sometimes recovered outside the group.
Further fossils have come from India, Madagascar and Antarctica. A possible &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;-like species occurs in Maastrichtian deposits of Mexico, extending the clade to North America.

The youngest gondwanatherians are known from the Eocene of South America and Antarctica. The Eocene genus &quot;Groeberia&quot; and Miocene genus &quot;Patagonia,&quot; two mammals from South America with unusual tooth morphologies usually considered metatherians, were considered by one paper to be gondwanatheres. However, their conclusions have generally not been accepted.

==Biology==

Gondwanatheres known from cranial remains almost universally have deep, robust snouts, as befitting their specialised herbivorous lifestyle. &quot;Vintana&quot; possesses bizarre jugal flanges similar to those of xenarthrans like ground sloths, though they had a palinal (front-to-back) chewing method as in most allotheres and unlike almost any therian. Most gondwanatheres are specialised grazers, even being among the first mammals to have specialised for grass-eating long before any therians did, with the exceptions of Groeberidae and Ferugliotheriidae, which lack hypsodont teeth and therefore had more generalistic herbivorous habits.

An articulated specimen found in the Maevarano Formation offers insight to the postcranial skeleton of these animals. Among the bizarre and unique features are a mediolaterally compressed and antero-posteriorly bowed tibia, a double trochlea (grooved structure) on the talus bone, a fully developed humeral trochlea, and an unusually high number of trunk vertebrae. The new taxon has at least 19 rib-bearing (thoracic) and 11 non-rib-bearing (lumbar) vertebrae. Aside from these derived features, the Malagasy mammal has a mosaic pectoral girdle morphology: the procoracoid is lost, the coracoid is extremely well developed (into an enlarged process that contributes to half of the glenoid fossa), the interclavicle is small, and the sternoclavicular joint appears mobile. A ventrally-facing glenoid and the well-developed humeral trochlea suggest a relatively parasagittal posture for the forelimbs. Remarkable features of the hind limb and pelvic girdle include a large obturator foramen similar in size to that of therians, a large parafibula, and the presence of an epipubic bone.

The fully described animal, now named &quot;Adalatherium hui&quot;, is a comparatively large sized mammal, compared in size to a large cat. It has more erect limbs than other allotheres.

<text>The Metropolitan Opera is an American opera company based in New York City, currently resident at the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, situated on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Referred to colloquially as the Met, the company is operated by the non-profit Metropolitan Opera Association, with Peter Gelb as the general manager. The company&#x27;s music director has been Yannick Nézet-Séguin since 2018.

The Met was founded in 1883 as an alternative to the previously established Academy of Music opera house and debuted the same year in a new building on 39th and Broadway (now known as the &quot;Old Met&quot;). It moved to the new Lincoln Center location in 1966.

The Metropolitan Opera is the largest classical music organization in North America. The company presents about 18 different operas each year from late September through early June. The operas are presented in a rotating repertory schedule, with up to seven performances of four different works staged each week. Performances are given in the evening Monday through Saturday with a matinée on Saturday. Several operas are presented in new productions each season. Sometimes these are borrowed from or shared with other opera companies. The rest of the year&#x27;s operas are given in revivals of productions from previous seasons. The 2015–16 season comprised 227 performances of 25 operas.

The operas in the Met&#x27;s repertoire consist of a wide range of works, from 18th-century Baroque and 19th-century Bel canto to the Minimalism of the late 20th and 21st centuries. These operas are presented in staged productions that range in style from those with elaborate traditional decors to others that feature modern conceptual designs.

The Met&#x27;s performing company consists of a large symphony orchestra, a chorus, children&#x27;s choir, and many supporting and leading solo singers. The company also employs numerous free-lance dancers, actors, musicians and other performers throughout the season. The Met&#x27;s roster of singers includes both international and American artists, some of whose careers have been developed through the Met&#x27;s young artists programs. While many singers appear periodically as guests with the company, others maintain a close long-standing association with the Met, appearing many times each season until they retire.

==History==
===Origins===
The Metropolitan Opera Company was founded in 1883 as an alternative to New York&#x27;s old established Academy of Music opera house. The subscribers to the academy&#x27;s limited number of private boxes represented the highest stratum in New York society. By 1880, these &quot;old money&quot; families were loath to admit New York&#x27;s newly wealthy industrialists into their long-established social circle. Frustrated with being excluded, the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s founding subscribers determined to build a new opera house that would outshine the old Academy in every way. A group of 22 men assembled at Delmonico&#x27;s restaurant on April 28, 1880. They elected officers and established subscriptions for ownership in the new company. The new theater, built at 39th and Broadway, would include three tiers of private boxes in which the scions of New York&#x27;s powerful new industrial families could display their wealth and establish their social prominence. The first subscribers included members of the Morgan, Roosevelt, and Vanderbilt families, all of whom had been excluded from the academy. The new Metropolitan Opera House opened on October 22, 1883, and was an immediate success, both socially and artistically. The Academy of Music&#x27;s opera season folded just three years after the Met opened.

===Inaugural season===
In its early decades the Met did not produce the opera performances itself but hired prominent manager/impresarios to stage a season of opera at the new Metropolitan Opera House. Henry Abbey served as manager for the inaugural season, 1883–84, which opened with a performance of Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; starring the brilliant Swedish soprano Christina Nilsson. Abbey&#x27;s company that first season featured an ensemble of artists led by sopranos Nilsson and Marcella Sembrich; mezzo-soprano Sofia Scalchi; tenors Italo Campanini and Roberto Stagno; baritone Giuseppe Del Puente; and bass Franco Novara. They gave 150 performances of 20 different operas by Gounod, Meyerbeer, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, Wagner, Mozart, Thomas, Bizet, Flotow, and Ponchielli. All performances were sung in Italian and were conducted either by music director Auguste Vianesi or Cleofonte Campanini (the tenor Italo&#x27;s brother).

The company performed not only in the new Manhattan opera house, but also started a long tradition of touring throughout the country. In the winter and spring of 1884 the Met presented opera in theaters in Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia (see below), Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Washington D.C., and Baltimore. Back in New York, the last night of the season featured a long gala performance to benefit Mr. Abbey. The special program consisted not only of various scenes from opera, but also offered Marcella Sembrich playing the violin and the piano, as well as the famed stage actors Henry Irving and Ellen Terry in a scene from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. Abbey&#x27;s inaugural season resulted in very large financial deficits.

====&quot;The Met in Philadelphia&quot;====
The Metropolitan Opera began a long history of performing in Philadelphia during its first season, presenting its entire repertoire in the city during January and April 1884. The company&#x27;s first Philadelphia performance was of &quot;Faust&quot; (with Christina Nilsson) on January 14, 1884, at the Chestnut Street Opera House. The Met continued to perform annually in Philadelphia for nearly eighty years, taking the entire company to the city on selected Tuesday nights throughout the opera season. Performances were usually held at Philadelphia&#x27;s Academy of Music, with the company presenting close to 900 performances in the city by 1961 when the Met&#x27;s regular visits ceased.

On April 26, 1910, the Met purchased the Philadelphia Opera House from Oscar Hammerstein I. The company renamed the house the Metropolitan Opera House and performed all of their Philadelphia performances there until 1920, when the company sold the theater and resumed performing at the Academy of Music.

During the Met&#x27;s early years, the company annually presented a dozen or more opera performances in Philadelphia throughout the season. Over the years the number of performances was gradually reduced until the final Philadelphia season in 1961 consisted of only four operas. The final performance of that last season was on March 21, 1961, with Birgit Nilsson and Franco Corelli in &quot;Turandot&quot;. After the Tuesday night visits were ended, the Met still returned to Philadelphia on its spring tours in 1967, 1968, 1978, and 1979.

===German seasons===
For its second season, the Met&#x27;s directors turned to Leopold Damrosch as general manager. The revered conductor of the New York Symphony Orchestra was engaged to lead the opera company in an all German language repertory and serve as its chief conductor. Under Damrosch, the company consisted of some the most celebrated singers from Europe&#x27;s German-language opera houses. The new German Met found great popular and critical success in the works of Wagner and other German composers as well as in Italian and French operas sung in German. Damrosch died only months into his first season at the Met. Edmund C. Stanton replaced Damrosch the following year and served as general manager through the 1890–91 season. The Met&#x27;s six German seasons were especially noted for performances by the celebrated conductor Anton Seidl whose Wagner interpretations were noted for their almost mystical intensity. The conductor Walter Damrosch, Leopold&#x27;s son, also initiated a long relationship with the Met during this period.

====&quot;Mapleson Cylinders&quot;====

From 1900 to 1904, Lionel Mapleson (1865–1937) made a series of sound recordings at the Met. Mapleson, the nephew of the opera impresario James Henry Mapleson, was employed by the Met as a violinist and music librarian. He used an Edison cylinder phonograph set-up near the stage to capture short, one- to five-minute recordings of the soloists, chorus and orchestra during performances. These unique acoustic documents, known as the Mapleson Cylinders, preserve an audio picture of the early Met, and are the only known extant recordings of some performers, including the tenor Jean de Reszke and the dramatic soprano Milka Ternina. The recordings were later issued on a series of LPs and, in 2002, were included in the National Recording Registry.

====Touring====
Beginning in 1898, the Metropolitan Opera company of singers and musicians undertook a six-week tour of American cities following its season in New York. These annual spring tours brought the company and its stars to cities throughout the U.S., most of which had no opera company of their own.

In Cleveland, for example, Met stops were sporadic until 1924, when underwriting efforts spearheaded by Newton D. Baker led to 3 consecutive years of annual 8-engagement performances. This led to the formation of the Northern Ohio Opera Association led by future U.S. Senator Robert J. Bulkley with the express purpose of underwriting long-term touring contracts with the Met. Cleveland was a particular lucrative stop for the Met, which had no competition in the form of a local opera company, and performances were held in the enormous Public Auditorium, which sat well over 9,000 people. The Met&#x27;s national tours continued until 1986. 

The Met also has a long history of international tours, stretching back to its first European visit to Paris in 1910. More recently, the company made a noteworthy tour of Japan in 2011, marking its seventh tour of the country since 1975, in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster that resulted from a severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The company performed Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La Bohème&quot;, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, and Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;.

Beginning in 2023, the company reinstated tours of the Met Orchestra. The European tour in June and July 2023, with stops in London, Paris, and Baden-Baden, marked the orchestra&#x27;s first tour to Europe in more than 20 years. The orchestra made its first-ever tour of Asia in the summer of 2024, performing in Seoul, Hyogo, Tokyo, and Taipei.

==Administrations==
===Abbey, Schoeffel, and Grau===
Italian opera returned to the Met in 1891 in a glittering season of stars organized by the returning Henry E. Abbey, John B. Schoeffel and Maurice Grau as Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau. After missing a season to rebuild the opera house following a fire in August 1892 which destroyed most of the theater, Abbey and Grau continued as co-managers along with John Schoeffel as the business partner, initiating the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Opera&quot;. Most of the greatest operatic artists in the world then graced the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House in Italian as well as German and French repertory. Notable among them were the brothers Jean and Édouard de Reszke, Lilli Lehmann, Emma Calvé, Lillian Nordica, Nellie Melba, Marcella Sembrich, Milka Ternina, Emma Eames, Sofia Scalchi, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Francesco Tamagno, Francesc Viñas, Jean Lassalle, Mario Ancona, Victor Maurel, Antonio Scotti and Pol Plançon. Henry Abbey died in 1896, and Maurice Grau continued as sole manager of the Met from 1896 to 1903.

The early 1900s saw the development of distinct Italian, German and later French &quot;wings&quot; within the Met&#x27;s roster of artists including separate German and Italian choruses. This division of the company&#x27;s forces faded after World War II when solo artists spent less time engaged at any one company.

===Heinrich Conried ===
The administration of Heinrich Conried in 1903–08 was distinguished especially by the arrival of the Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso, the most celebrated singer who ever appeared at the old Metropolitan. He was also instrumental in hiring conductor Arturo Vigna.

===Giulio Gatti-Casazza===
Conried was followed by Giulio Gatti-Casazza, who held a 27-year tenure from 1908 to 1935. Gatti-Casazza had been lured by the Met from a celebrated tenure as director of Milan&#x27;s La Scala Opera House. His model planning, authoritative organizational skills and brilliant casts raised the Metropolitan Opera to a prolonged era of artistic innovation and musical excellence. He brought with him the fiery and brilliant conductor Arturo Toscanini, the music director from his seasons at La Scala.
Many of the most noted singers of the era appeared at the Met under Gatti-Casazza&#x27;s leadership, including sopranos Rosa Ponselle, Elisabeth Rethberg, Maria Jeritza, Emmy Destinn, Frances Alda, Frida Leider, Amelita Galli-Curci, Bernice de Pasquali, and Lily Pons; tenors Jacques Urlus, Giovanni Martinelli, Beniamino Gigli, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, and Lauritz Melchior; baritones Titta Ruffo, Giuseppe De Luca, Pasquale Amato, and Lawrence Tibbett; and basses Friedrich Schorr, Feodor Chaliapin, Jose Mardones, Tancredi Pasero and Ezio Pinza—among many others.

Toscanini served as the Met&#x27;s principal conductor (but with no official title) from 1908 to 1915, leading the company in performances of Verdi, Wagner and others that set standards for the company for decades to come. The Viennese composer Gustav Mahler also was a Met conductor during Gatti-Casazza&#x27;s first two seasons and in later years conductors Tullio Serafin and Artur Bodanzky led the company in the Italian and German repertories respectively.

Following Toscanini&#x27;s departure, Gatti-Casazza successfully guided the company through the years of World War I into another decade of premieres, new productions and popular success in the 1920s. The 1930s, however, brought new financial and organizational challenges for the company. In 1931, Otto Kahn, the noted financier, resigned as head of the Met&#x27;s board of directors and president of the Metropolitan Opera Company. He had been responsible for engaging Gatti-Casazza and had held the position of president since the beginning of Gatti-Casazza&#x27;s term as manager. The new chair, prominent lawyer Paul Cravath, had served as the board&#x27;s legal counsel. Retaining Gatti-Casazza as manager, Cravath focused his attention on managing the business affairs of the company.

In 1926, as part of the construction of Rockefeller Center, a plan was floated to move the opera from the building on 39th Street to the new Rockefeller Center. The plan was dropped in 1929 when it became apparent that it would produce no savings, and because the Met did not have enough money to move to a new opera house. It soon became apparent that the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and subsequent depression had resulted in a dangerously large deficit in the company&#x27;s accounts. Between 1929 and 1931 ticket sales remained robust, but subsidies from the Met&#x27;s wealthy supporters had significantly declined.

Soon after his appointment, Cravath obtained new revenue through a contract with the National Broadcasting Company for weekly radio broadcasts of Met performances. The first national broadcast took place December 25, 1931, when &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; was aired. With Gatti&#x27;s support, Cravath also obtained a ten percent reduction in the pay of all salaried employees beginning with the opera season of 1931/32. Cravath also engineered a reorganization of the management company by which it was transformed from a corporation, in which all participants were stockholders, to an association, whose members need not have a financial interest in operations. Apart from this change, the new Metropolitan Opera Association was virtually identical to the old Metropolitan Opera Company. It was hoped the association would be able to save money as it renegotiated contracts which the company had made.

During this period there was no change in the organization of the Metropolitan Real Estate Opera Company which owned the opera house. It remained in the hands of the society families who owned its stock, yet the subsidies that the house and its owners had given the producing company fell off. In March 1932, Cravath found that income resulting from the broadcasts and savings from both salary cuts and reorganization were not sufficient to cover the company&#x27;s deficits. Representatives of the opera house, the producing company, and the artists formed a committee for fundraising among the public at large. Mainly though appeals made to radio audiences during the weekly broadcasts, the committee was able to obtain enough money to assure continuation of opera for the 1933–34 season. Called the committee to Save Metropolitan Opera, the group was headed by the well-loved leading soprano, Lucrezia Bori. Bori not only led the committee, but also personally carried out much of its work and within a few months her fundraising efforts produced the $300,000 that were needed for the coming season.

===Edward Johnson===
In April 1935, Gatti stepped down after 27 years as general manager. His immediate successor, the former Met bass Herbert Witherspoon, died of a heart attack barely six weeks into his term of office. This opened the way for the Canadian tenor and former Met artist Edward Johnson to be appointed general manager. Johnson served the company for the next 15 years, guiding the Met through the remaining years of the depression and the World War II era.

The producing company&#x27;s financial difficulties continued in the years immediately following the desperate season of 1933–34. To meet budget shortfalls, fundraising continued and the number of performances was curtailed. Still, on given nights the brilliant Wagner pairing of the Norwegian soprano Kirsten Flagstad with the great heldentenor Lauritz Melchior proved irresistible to audiences even in such troubled times. To expand the Met&#x27;s support among its national radio audience, the Met board&#x27;s Eleanor Robson Belmont, the former actress and wife to industrialist August Belmont, was appointed head of a new organization—the Metropolitan Opera Guild—as successor to a women&#x27;s club Belmont had set up. The Guild supported the producing company through subscriptions to its magazine, Opera News, and through Mrs. Belmont&#x27;s weekly appeals on the Met&#x27;s radio broadcasts. In 1940 ownership of the performing company and the opera house was transferred to the non-profit Metropolitan Opera Association from the company&#x27;s original partnership of New York society families.

Zinka Milanov, Jussi Björling, and Alexander Kipnis were first heard at the Met under Johnson&#x27;s management. During World War II when many European artists were unavailable, the Met recruited American singers as never before. Eleanor Steber, Dorothy Kirsten, Helen Traubel (Flagstad&#x27;s successor as Wagner&#x27;s heroines), Jan Peerce, Richard Tucker, Leonard Warren and Robert Merrill were among the many home grown artists to become stars at the Met in the 1940s. Ettore Panizza, Sir Thomas Beecham, George Szell and Bruno Walter were among the leading conductors engaged during Johnson&#x27;s tenure. Kurt Adler began his long tenure as chorus master and staff conductor in 1943.

===Rudolf Bing===

Succeeding Johnson in 1950 was the Austrian-born Rudolf Bing who had most recently created and served as director of the Edinburgh Festival. Serving from 1950 to 1972, Bing became one of the Met&#x27;s most influential and reformist leaders. Bing modernized the administration of the company, ended an archaic ticket sales system, and brought an end to the company&#x27;s Tuesday night performances in Philadelphia. He presided over an era of fine singing and glittering new productions, while guiding the company&#x27;s move to a new home in Lincoln Center. While many outstanding singers debuted at the Met under Bing&#x27;s guiding hand, music critics complained of a lack of great conducting during his regime, even though such eminent conductors as Fritz Stiedry, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Erich Leinsdorf, Fritz Reiner, and Karl Böhm appeared frequently in the 1950s and &#x27;60s.

Among the most significant achievements of Bing&#x27;s tenure was the opening of the Met&#x27;s artistic roster to include singers of color. Marian Anderson&#x27;s historic 1955 debut was followed by the introduction of a gifted generation of African American artists led by Leontyne Price (who inaugurated the new house at Lincoln Center), Reri Grist, Grace Bumbry, Shirley Verrett, Martina Arroyo, George Shirley, Robert McFerrin, and many others. Other celebrated singers who debuted at the Met during Bing&#x27;s tenure include: Roberta Peters, Victoria de los Ángeles, Renata Tebaldi, Maria Callas, who had a bitter falling out with Bing over repertoire, Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Mirella Freni, Renata Scotto, Montserrat Caballé, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Anna Moffo, James McCracken, Carlo Bergonzi, Franco Corelli, Alfredo Kraus, Plácido Domingo, Nicolai Gedda, Luciano Pavarotti, Jon Vickers, Tito Gobbi, Sherrill Milnes, and Cesare Siepi.

The Met&#x27;s 1961 production of &quot;Turandot&quot;, with Leopold Stokowski conducting, Birgit Nilsson in the title role, and Franco Corelli as Calàf, was called the Met&#x27;s &quot;biggest hit in 10 years&quot;. For the 1962/1963 season, Renata Tebaldi, popular with Met audiences, convinced a reluctant Bing to stage a revival of &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, an opera last presented at the Met in 1907.

In 1963, Anthony Bliss, a prominent New York lawyer and president of the Metropolitan Opera Association (MOA), convinced the MOA to create the Metropolitan Opera National Company (MONC); a second touring company that would present operas nationally with young operatic talent. Supported by President John F. Kennedy and funded largely by donations given by philanthropist and publisher Lila Acheson Wallace, the company presented two seasons of operas in 1965–1966 and 1966–1967 in which hundreds of performances were given in hundreds of cities throughout the United States. Bing publicly supported the organization, but privately detested the idea and actively worked to dismantle the company which he ultimately achieved in a vote of the board in December 1966. The MONC&#x27;s directors were mezzo-soprano Risë Stevens and Michael Manuel, a long time stage manager and director at the Met. Several well known opera singers performed with the MONC, including sopranos Clarice Carson, Maralin Niska, Mary Beth Peil, Francesca Roberto, and Marilyn Zschau; mezzo-sopranos Joy Davidson, Sylvia Friederich, Dorothy Krebill, and Huguette Tourangeau; tenors Enrico Di Giuseppe, Chris Lachona, Nicholas di Virgilio, and Harry Theyard; baritones Ron Bottcher, John Fiorito, Thomas Jamerson, Julian Patrick, and Vern Shinall; bass-baritones Andrij Dobriansky, Ronald Hedlund, and Arnold Voketaitis; and bass Paul Plishka.

During Bing&#x27;s tenure, the officers of the Met joined forces with the officers of the New York Philharmonic to build the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, where the new Metropolitan Opera House building opened in 1966.

The Met&#x27;s first season at Lincoln Center featured nine new productions, including the world premiere of Marvin David Levy&#x27;s &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot;. However, the company would not premiere any new operas for decades afterwards, until 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Ghosts of Versailles&quot; by John Corigliano. One critic described the period as &quot;a quarter-century in which the notion of commissioned work reminded Met administrators of the emblematic failure of Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and the lukewarm reception of Marvin David Levy&#x27;s &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot;.&quot;

===Gentele to Southern===
Following Bing&#x27;s retirement in 1972, the Met&#x27;s management was overseen by a succession of executives and artists in shared authority. Bing&#x27;s intended successor, the Swedish opera manager Göran Gentele, died in an auto accident before the start of his first season. Following Gentele&#x27;s death, Schuyler Chapin served as general manager for three seasons. The key achievement of his tenure was the Met&#x27;s first tour to Japan for three weeks in May–June 1975 which was the brainchild of impresario Kazuko Hillyer. The tour played a significant role in popularizing opera in Japan, and boasted an impressive line-up of artists in productions of &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, and &quot;La bohème&quot;; including Marilyn Horne as Carmen, Joan Sutherland as Violetta, and tenors Franco Corelli and Luciano Pavarotti alternating as Rodolfo. Soprano Renata Tebaldi retired from the Met in 1973 as Desdemona in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, the same role she debuted there in 1955.

From 1975 to 1981, a triumvirate of directors led the company: the general manager (Anthony A. Bliss), artistic director (James Levine), and director of production (English stage director John Dexter). Bliss was followed by Bruce Crawford and Hugh Southern. Through this period, the constant figure was Levine. Engaged by Bing in 1971, Levine became principal conductor in 1973 and emerged as the Met&#x27;s principal artistic leader through the last third of the 20th century.

During the 1983–1984 season, the Met celebrated its 100th anniversary with an opening night revival of Berlioz&#x27;s opera &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, with soprano Jessye Norman making her Met debut in the roles of both Cassandra and Dido. An eight-hour Centennial Gala concert in two parts followed on October 22, 1983, broadcast on PBS. The gala featured all of the Met&#x27;s current stars as well as appearances by 26 veteran stars of the Met&#x27;s the past. Among the artists, Leonard Bernstein and Birgit Nilsson gave their last performances with the company at the concert. This season also marked the debut of bass Samuel Ramey, who debuted as Argante in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Rinaldo&quot; in January 1984.

The immediate post-Bing era saw a continuing addition of African-Americans to the roster of leading artists. Kathleen Battle, who in 1977 made her Met debut as the Shepherd in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, became an important star in lyric soprano roles. Bass-baritone Simon Estes began a prominent Met career with his 1982 debut as Hermann, also in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

===Joseph Volpe===
The model of General Manager as the leading authority in the company returned in 1990 when the company appointed Joseph Volpe. He was the Met&#x27;s third-longest serving manager, and was the first head of the company to advance from within its ranks, having started his career there as a carpenter in 1964. During his tenure, the Met&#x27;s international touring activities were expanded and Levine focused on expanding and building the Met&#x27;s orchestra into a world-class symphonic ensemble with its own Carnegie Hall concert series. Under Volpe, the Met considerably expanded its repertory, offering four world premieres and 22 Met premieres, more new works than under any manager since Gatti-Casazza. Volpe chose Valery Gergiev, who was then the chief conductor and artistic director of the Mariinsky Theatre, as Principal Guest Conductor in 1997 and broadened the Met&#x27;s Russian repertory. Marcelo Álvarez, Gabriela Beňačková, Diana Damrau, Natalie Dessay, Renée Fleming, Juan Diego Flórez, Marcello Giordani, Angela Gheorghiu, Susan Graham, Ben Heppner, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Salvatore Licitra, Anna Netrebko, René Pape, Neil Rosenshein, Bryn Terfel, and Deborah Voigt were among the artists first heard at the Met under his management. He retired as general manager in 2006.

===Peter Gelb===
Peter Gelb, formerly a record producer, succeeded Volpe as general manager of the company in 2006.. Gelb began outlining his plans in April 2006; these included more new productions each year, ideas for shaving staging costs, and attracting new audiences without deterring existing opera-lovers. Gelb saw these issues as crucial for an organization which is dependent on private financing.

Gelb began his tenure by opening the 2006–2007 season with a production of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; by Anthony Minghella originally staged for English National Opera. Gelb focused on expanding the Met&#x27;s audience through a number of fronts. Increasing the number of new productions every season to keep the Met&#x27;s stagings fresh and noteworthy, Gelb partnered with other opera companies to import productions and engaged directors from theater, circus, and film to produce the Met&#x27;s own original productions. Theater directors Bartlett Sher, Mary Zimmerman, and Jack O&#x27;Brien joined the list of the Met&#x27;s directors along with Stephen Wadsworth, Willy Decker, Laurent Pelly, Luc Bondy and other opera directors to create new stagings for the company. Robert Lepage, the Canadian director of Cirque du Soleil, was engaged by the Met to direct a revival of &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; using hydraulic stage platforms and projected 3D imagery. Gelb also initiated live high-definition video transmissions to cinemas worldwide, and regular live satellite radio broadcasts on the Met&#x27;s own SiriusXM radio channel.

In 2010, the company named Fabio Luisi as its principal guest conductor in 2010, and subsequently its principal conductor in 2011, to fill a void created by Levine&#x27;s two-year absence because of illness. In 2013, following the severance of the dancers&#x27; contracts, Gelb announced that the resident ballet company at the Met would cease to exist.

In 2014, Gelb and the Met found new controversy with a production of John Adams&#x27;s opera &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot;, due to criticism that the work was antisemitic. In response to the controversy Gelb canceled the scheduled worldwide HD video presentation of a performance, but refused demands to cancel the live performances scheduled for October and November 2014. Demonstrators held signs and chanted &quot;Shame on Gelb&quot;.

On April 14, 2016, the company announced the conclusion of Levine&#x27;s tenure as music director at the conclusion of the 2015–16 season. Gelb announced that Levine would also become Music Director Emeritus. On June 2, the Met board announced the appointment of Yannick Nézet-Séguin as the company&#x27;s next music director, as of the 2020–2021 season, conducting five productions each season. He took the title of music director-designate, conducting two productions a year, as of the 2017–2018 season. 

In February 2018, Nézet-Séguin succeeded Levine as music director of the Metropolitan Opera. In August 2024, the company announced the extension of Nézet-Séguin&#x27;s contract as its music director through the 2029–2030 season.

In 2017, Daniele Rustioni first guest-conducted at the Metropolitan Opera. In November 2024, the company announced the appointment of Rustioni as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2025-2026 season, with an initial contract of three seasons.

====James Levine controversy====
In response to a December 2017 news article, the Met announced that it would investigate Levine with regard to sexual abuse allegations dating back to the 1980s. The company suspended its ties with Levine, and canceled all upcoming engagements with him. Gelb had been contacted directly by a police detective in October 2016 about allegations of sexual abuse of a minor by Levine, had been aware of the accuser&#x27;s abuse allegations since they were made in a 2016 police report and of the attendant police investigation, but did not suspend Levine or launch an investigation until over a year later.

Following the investigations in March 2018, the Met stated that there was conclusive evidence for &quot;sexually abusive and harassing conduct&quot; by Levine. On March 12, 2018, the company announced the full termination of its relationship with Levine, including the rescinding of his title of music director emeritus and dismissal of him as artistic director of its young artists program. On March 15, 2018, Levine filed suit against the company with the New York State Supreme Court, for breach of contract and defamation, and continued to deny the allegations. In response to the suit, the company has stated: &quot;It is shocking that Mr. Levine has refused to accept responsibility for his actions, and has today instead decided to lash out at the Met with a suit riddled with untruths.&quot; On August 7, 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Metropolitan Opera and Levine both privately settled their lawsuits. Continuing with the lawsuits &quot;could have put into the public record more details of accusations...&quot;

====Russia-Ukraine anti-war activism====
On February 28, 2022, Gelb announced that because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Met would be severing ties with all staff and employees who are supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The same night, before the premiere of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, the Met&#x27;s chorus and orchestra performed the national anthem of Ukraine. Among the singers was Ukrainian bass-baritone Vladyslav Buialskyi, making his Met debut; footage of him standing center-stage as the only singer without a score and with a hand over his heart was aired by Ukrainian news outlets.

In March 2022, Russian-born soprano Anna Netrebko made a public statement against the war but failed to explicitly denounce Putin, and was replaced by a Ukrainian singer. Netrebko had performed over 200 times at the Met over the past 20 years. Gelb called her dismissal &quot;a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera&quot; adding &quot;but with Putin killing innocent victims in Ukraine there was no way forward&quot; for her to continue to be associated with the Met.

On March 14, the Met hosted a benefit concert with all proceeds going to relief efforts in Ukraine, with Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations in attendance. The concert, which was broadcast on worldwide radio including Ukrainian public radio, began with Buialskyi singing the national anthem of Ukraine as a soloist.

In December 2022, the Metropolitan Opera website was a target of a ransomware attack, with a &quot;speculation that Russia could be behind the cyberattack&quot;. Gelb rejected that rumor.

To mark the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, the Met Opera held a concert entitled &quot;For Ukraine: A Concert of Remembrance and Hope&quot; on February 24, 2023. The company&#x27;s music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, led the Met Orchestra and Chorus in a program of Mozart&#x27;s Requiem and Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony. Ukraine&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said, &quot;This is a concert in celebration of Ukrainian resilience and hope. The Metropolitan Opera was among the first to show solidarity with Ukraine, its people, culture, and artists, and it has continued to do so throughout the past year of this tragic invasion. We&#x27;re proud to work with the Met to promote a just peace.&quot; He added, &quot;All wars come to an end, but we will always remember who was with us from the first, most difficult, moments.&quot;

==The Met Orchestra Musicians==
In 2015, The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra Committee formed a separate 501(c)3 organization which does business as &#x27;Met Orchestra Musicians&#x27;. When the Metropolitan Opera furloughed its orchestra on April 1, 2020, the orchestra used this organization to fundraise with a goal to give out needs-based grants to its members, associates, music librarians and assistant conductors affiliated with the Metropolitan Opera. As of October 19, 2020, 30% of the orchestra has been forced to move out of New York City due to not being able to afford living costs.

==Technological innovations==
===Met Titles===
In 1995, under general manager Joseph Volpe, the Met installed its own system of presenting a scripted version of opera texts designed for the particular needs of the Met and its audiences. Called &quot;Met Titles&quot;, the $2.7 million system provides the audience with a script of the opera&#x27;s text in English on individual screens which face each seat. This system was the first in the world to be placed in an opera house with &quot;each screen (having) a switch to turn it on, a privacy filter to prevent the dim, yellow dot-matrix characters from disturbing nearby viewers and the option to display texts in multiple languages for all productions, (currently German and Spanish) . The custom-designed system features rails of different heights for various sections of the house, individually designed displays for some box seats and commissioned scripts costing up to $10,000 apiece.&quot; Owing to the height of the Met&#x27;s proscenium, it was not feasible to have surtitles displayed above the stage, as is done in most other opera houses. Levine had opposed the idea of above-stage titles, but the &quot;Met Titles&quot; system has since been acknowledged as an ideal solution, offering texts to only those members of the Met audience who desire them. Surtitlers at the Met have included Sonya Haddad, whose 2004 obituary called her &quot;one of the country&#x27;s leading practitioners of her art&quot;, Cori Ellison and Sonya Friedman.

===Tessitura software===
In 1998, Volpe initiated the development of a new software application, now called Tessitura. Tessitura uses a single database of information to record, track and manage all contacts with the Met&#x27;s constituents, conduct targeted marketing and fund raising appeals, handle all ticketing and membership transactions, and provide detailed and flexible performance reports. Beginning in 2000, Tessitura was offered to other arts organizations under license, and it is now used by a cooperative network of more than 200 opera companies, symphony orchestras, ballet companies, theater companies, performing arts centers, and museums in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. At the Opera Conference 2016 in Montreal Gelb announced that the Met had commissioned a new ticketing system that would be made available to other institutions.

Outside of New York the Met has been known to audiences in large measure through its many years of live radio broadcasts. The Met&#x27;s broadcast history goes back to January 1910 when radio pioneer Lee de Forest broadcast experimentally, with erratic signal, two live performances from the stage of the Met that were reportedly heard as far away as Newark, New Jersey. Today the annual Met broadcast season typically begins the first week of December and offers twenty live Saturday matinée performances through May.

The first network broadcast was heard on December 25, 1931, a performance of Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s
&quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;. The series came about as the Met, financially endangered in the early years of the Great Depression, sought to enlarge its audience and support through national exposure on network radio. Initially, those broadcasts featured only parts of operas, being limited to selected acts. Regular broadcasts of complete operas began March 11, 1933, with the transmission of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; with Frida Leider and Lauritz Melchior.

The live broadcasts were originally heard on NBC Radio&#x27;s Blue Network and continued on the Blue Network&#x27;s successor, ABC, into the 1960s. As network radio waned, the Met founded its own Metropolitan Opera Radio Network which is now heard on radio stations around the world. In Canada the live broadcasts have been heard since December 1933 first on the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission and, since 1934, on its successor, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation where they are currently heard on CBC Music.

Technical quality of the broadcasts steadily improved over the years. FM broadcasts were added in the 1950s, transmitted to stations via telephone lines. Starting with the 1973–74 season, all broadcasts were offered in FM stereo. Satellite technology later allowed uniformly excellent broadcast sound to be sent live worldwide.

Sponsorship of the Met broadcasts during the Depression years of the 1930s was sporadic. Early sponsors included the American Tobacco Company, and the Lambert Pharmaceutical Company, but frequently the broadcasts were presented by NBC itself with no commercial sponsor. Sponsorship of the Saturday afternoon broadcasts by The Texas Company (Texaco) began on December 7, 1940, with Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;. Texaco&#x27;s support continued for 63 years, the longest continuous sponsorship in broadcast history and included the first PBS television broadcasts. After its merger with Chevron, however, the combined company ChevronTexaco ended its sponsorship of the Met&#x27;s radio network in April 2004. Emergency grants allowed the broadcasts to continue through 2005 when the home building company Toll Brothers became primary sponsor.

In the seven decades of its Saturday broadcasts, the Met has been introduced by the voices of only four permanent announcers. Milton Cross served from the inaugural 1931 broadcast until his death in 1975. He was succeeded by Peter Allen, who served for 29 years, through the 2003–04 season. Margaret Juntwait began her tenure as host the following season. From September 2006 through December 2014, Juntwait also served as host for all of the live and recorded broadcasts on the Met&#x27;s Sirius XM satellite radio channel, Metropolitan Opera Radio. Beginning in January 2015, producer Mary Jo Heath filled in for Juntwait, who was being treated for cancer and died in June 2015. In September 2015, Heath took over as the new permanent host. Opera singer and director Ira Siff has for several years been the commentator, along with Juntwait or Heath. In September 2021, Debra Lew Harder took over as the Met&#x27;s broadcast host, the fifth in company history.

===Satellite radio===
Metropolitan Opera Radio is a 24-hour opera channel on Sirius XM Radio, which presents multiple live opera broadcasts each week during the Met&#x27;s performing season. During other hours it also offers past broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcast archives. The channel was created in September 2006, when the Met initiated a multi-year relationship with Sirius. Margaret Juntwait is the main host and announcer, with William Berger as writer and co-host.

===Television===
The Met&#x27;s experiments with television go back to 1948 when a complete performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; was broadcast live on ABC-TV with Ramón Vinay, Licia Albanese, and Leonard Warren. The 1949 season opening night &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; was also telecast. In the early 1950s the Met tried a short-lived experiment with live closed-circuit television transmissions to movie theaters. The first of these was a performance of &quot;Carmen&quot; with Risë Stevens which was sent to 31 theaters in 27 US cities on December 11, 1952. Beyond these experiments, however, and an occasional gala or special, the Met did not become a regular presence on television until 1977.

In that year the company began a series of live television broadcasts on public television with a wildly successful live telecast of &quot;La bohème&quot; with Renata Scotto and Luciano Pavarotti. The new series of opera on PBS was called &quot;Live from the Metropolitan Opera&quot;. This series remained on the air until the early 2000s, although the live broadcasts gave way to taped performances and in 1988 the title was changed to &quot;The Metropolitan Opera Presents&quot;. Dozens of televised performances were broadcast during the life of the series including an historic complete telecast of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; in 1989. In 2007 another Met television series debuted on PBS, &quot;Great Performances at the Met&quot;. This series airs repeat showings of the high-definition video performances produced for the &quot;Metropolitan Opera Live in HD&quot; cinema series.

In addition to complete operas and gala concerts, television programs produced at the Met have included: an episode of &quot;Omnibus&quot; with Leonard Bernstein (NBC, 1958); &quot;Danny Kaye&#x27;s Look-In at the Metropolitan Opera&quot; (CBS, 1975); &quot;Sills and Burnett at the Met&quot; (CBS, 1976); and the MTV Video Music Awards (1999 and 2001).

===High-definition video===
Beginning on December 30, 2006, as part of the company&#x27;s effort to build revenues and attract new audiences, the Met (along with NCM Fathom) broadcast a series of six performances live via satellite into movie theaters called &quot;Metropolitan Opera: Live in HD&quot;. The first broadcast was the Saturday matinee live performance of the 110-minute version of Julie Taymor&#x27;s production of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. The series was carried in over 100 movie theaters across North America, Japan, Britain and several other European countries. During the 2006–07 season, the series included live HD transmissions of &quot;I puritani&quot;, &quot;The First Emperor&quot;, &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, and &quot;Il trittico&quot;. In addition, limited repeat showings of the operas were offered in most of the presenting cities. Digital sound for the performances was provided by Sirius Satellite Radio.

These movie transmissions have received wide and generally favorable press coverage. The Met reports that 91% of available seats were sold for the HD performances. According to General Manager Peter Gelb, there were 60,000 people in cinemas around the world watching the March 24 transmission of &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that 324,000 tickets were sold worldwide for the 2006/07 season, while each simulcast cost $850,000 to $1 million to produce.

The 2007/08 season began on December 15, 2007, and featured eight of the Met&#x27;s productions starting with &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; and ending with &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; on April 26, 2008. The Met planned to broadcast to double the number of theaters in the US as the previous season, as well as to additional countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The number of participating venues in the US, which includes movie theatre chains as well as independent theatres and some college campus venues, is 343. while &quot;the scope of the series expands to include more than 700 locations across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia&quot;.

By the end of the season 920,000 people—exceeding the total number of people who attended live performances at the Met over the entire season—attended the eight screenings bringing in a gross of $13.3 million from North America and $5 million from overseas.

===Internet===
Video and audio recordings of hundreds of complete operas and excerpts are available via Met Opera on Demand, the Met&#x27;s own online archive of recorded performances. The Met Opera on Demand catalog currently holds more than 850 complete performances from the last 90 years, ranging from telecasts to radio broadcasts to recent &quot;Live in HD&quot; presentations. Complete operas and selections are also available on the online music service Rhapsody, and for purchase on iTunes.

The Metropolitan Opera Radio channel on Sirius XM Radio (see above) is available to listeners via the internet in addition to satellite broadcast.

The Met&#x27;s official site also provides complete composer and background information, detailed plot summaries, and cast and characters for all current and upcoming opera broadcasts, as well as for every opera broadcast since 2000. The Met&#x27;s online archive database provides links to all Rhapsody, Sirius XM, and Met Player operas, with complete program and cast information. The online archive also provides an exhaustive searchable list of every performance and performer in the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s history.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
When people&#x27;s movements were heavily restricted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Met cancelled the season&#x27;s remaining performances but live streamed free of charge an opera every day, normally available on paid subscription. On September 23, 2020, the Met announced the cancellation of its entire 2020–2021 season. The Met reopened in time for the 2021–2022 season, beginning with a concert of Verdi&#x27;s Requiem to mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11. On October 24, 2022, the Met, in conjunction with the NY Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall dropped their masking requirements, the last COVID-related restriction that was still in place.

==Opera houses==


===Metropolitan Opera House, Broadway===
The first Metropolitan Opera House opened on October 22, 1883, with a performance of &quot;Faust&quot;. It was located at 1411 Broadway between 39th and 40th Streets and was designed by J. Cleaveland Cady. Gutted by fire on August 27, 1892, the theater was immediately rebuilt, reopening in the fall of 1893. Another major renovation was completed in 1903. The theater&#x27;s interior was extensively redesigned by the architects Carrère and Hastings. The familiar red and gold interior associated with the house dates from this time. The old Met had a seating capacity of 3,625 with an additional 224 standing room places.

The theater was noted for its elegance and excellent acoustics and it provided a glamorous home for the company. Its stage facilities, however, were found to be severely inadequate from its earliest days. Over the years many plans for a new opera house were explored and abandoned, including a proposal to incorporate a new Metropolitan Opera House into the construction of Rockefeller Center. It was only with the development of Lincoln Center that the Met was able to build itself a new home. The Met held a lavish farewell gala performance for the old house on April 16, 1966. The theater closed after a short season of ballet later in the spring of 1966 and was demolished in 1967.

===Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center===
The present Metropolitan Opera House is located in Lincoln Center at Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side and was designed by architect Wallace K. Harrison. It has a seating capacity of approximately 3,732 with an additional 245 standing room places at the rear of the main floor and the top balcony. As needed, the size of the orchestra pit can be decreased and another row of 35 seats added at the front of the auditorium. The lobby is adorned with two famous murals by Marc Chagall, &quot;The Triumph of Music&quot; and &quot;The Sources of Music&quot;. Each of these gigantic paintings measures 30 by 36 feet.

After numerous revisions to its design, the new building opened September 16, 1966, with the world premiere of Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.

The theater, while large, is noted for its excellent acoustics. The stage facilities, state of the art when the theater was built, continue to be updated technically and are capable of handling multiple large complex opera productions simultaneously. When the opera company is on , the Opera House is annually home to the spring season of American Ballet Theatre. It has also hosted visits from other noted opera and ballet companies.

===Metropolitan Opera House, Philadelphia===
To provide a home for its regular Tuesday night performances in Philadelphia, the Met purchased an opera house originally built in 1908 by Oscar Hammerstein I, the Philadelphia Opera House at North Broad and Poplar Streets. Renamed the Metropolitan Opera House, the theater was operated by the Met from 1910 until it sold the house in April 1920. The Met debuted at its new Philadelphia home on December 13, 1910, with a performance of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; starring Leo Slezak and Olive Fremstad.

The Philadelphia Met was designed by noted theater architect William H. McElfatrick and had a seating capacity of approximately 4,000. The theater still stands and currently functions as a church and community arts center.

==Principal conductors==
In the Met&#x27;s inaugural season of 1883–1884, Auguste Vianesi, who conducted most of the performances that season including the opening night, was listed in the playbills as &quot;Musical Director and Conductor&quot;; thereafter, the Met did not have another officially designated &quot;music director&quot; until Rafael Kubelík in 1973. However, several of the Met&#x27;s conductors have assumed more prominent leadership role at different times in the company&#x27;s history. They set artistic standards and influenced the quality and performance style of the orchestra, but without any official title. The Met has also had many famed guest conductors who are not listed here.

==Deaths at the Met==
Over the years, a number of deaths have occurred at the Metropolitan Opera House. On February 10, 1897, French bass Armand Castelmary suffered a heart attack onstage in the finale of act one of Flotow&#x27;s &quot;Martha&quot;. He died in the arms of his friend, tenor Jean de Reszke, after the curtain was brought down. The performance resumed with Giuseppe Cernusco substituting in the role of Sir Tristram. On May 10, 1935, Herbert Witherspoon, the incoming General Manager suffered a heart attack and died at his desk. On March 4, 1960, leading baritone Leonard Warren died of a heart attack onstage after completing the aria &quot;Urna fatale&quot; in act two of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot;. On April 30, 1977, Betty Stone, a member of the Met chorus, was killed in an accident offstage during a tour performance of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; in Cleveland. On July 23, 1980, Helen Hagnes Mintiks, a 30-year-old Canadian-born violinist, was murdered by Met stagehand Craig Crimmins during the intermission of a performance of the Berlin Ballet. The event was cited by numerous publications as &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; murder. On January 5, 1996, tenor Richard Versalle died while playing the role of Vitek during the production of Leoš Janáček&#x27;s &quot;The Makropulos Case&quot;. Versalle was climbing a ladder in the opening scene when he suffered a heart attack and fell to the stage.

In addition, several audience members have died at the Met. The most widely known incident was the suicide of operagoer Bantcho Bantchevsky on January 23, 1988, during an intermission in a live broadcast of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

==Finances and marketing==
The company&#x27;s annual operating budget for the 2011–2012 season was $325 million, of which $182 million (43%) comes from private donations. The total potential audience across a season is 800,000 seats. The average audience rate for the 3800-seat theater in 2011 was 79.2%, down from a peak of 88% in 2009. Beyond performing in the opera house in New York, the Met has gradually expanded its audience over the years through technology. It has broadcast regularly on radio since 1931 and on television since 1977. In 2006, the Met began live satellite radio and internet broadcasts as well as live high-definition video transmissions presented in cinemas throughout the world. In 2011, the total HD audience reached 3 million through 1600 theaters worldwide. In 2014, according to Wheeler Winston Dixon, high ticket prices were making it difficult for average people to attend performances.

<doc id="216644" wikidata="Q29979" url="?curid=216644" title="Pleurothallis">
<text>Pleurothallis is a genus of orchids commonly called bonnet orchids. The genus name is derived from the Greek word , meaning &quot;riblike branches&quot;. This refers to the rib-like stems of many species. The genus is often abbreviated as &quot;Pths&quot; in horticultural trade.

This was a huge genus, which contained more than 1,200 species - the second largest in the Orchidaceae after &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot;. In 2004, it decreased by more than half when many species were moved into new genera.

==Distribution==
&quot;Pleurothallis&quot; is a completely New World group, widespread across much of Mexico, Central America, South America and the West Indies. Flora of North America lists one species in Florida &quot;(P. gelida)&quot; but this has now been transferred to a different genus, &quot;Stelis&quot;. The center of diversity of the genus is in the high Andes, especially in the chain of cloud forests in Colombia. &quot;Pleurothallis&quot; grows in dry or wet, tropical or temperate climates.

==Description==
As a group they show a huge range in vegetative form, terrestrial or epiphytic, and can be found as tall cane-like plants a meter or so high, clumped or trailing, pendent or climbing, erect or creeping, tufted and tiny, delicate moss-like species that can grow on the thinnest of twigs. But they have one common denominator: they all have two pollinia.

They have reduced their pseudobulbs and instead, some species have thick succulent leaves.

Their flowers are among the most diverse and unusual, although often very small, and specialize in using tiny insects such as gnats, flies or small wasps for pollination.

==Taxonomy==
To bring some order in this extremely diverse genus, 29 subgenera and 25 sections had been created. Much of this work has been done by Dr. C. Luer of the Missouri Botanical Garden. A new analysis, based on DNA testing, confirmed on the whole the classification of the subtribe Pleurothallidinae, with however &quot;Pleurothallis&quot; as the main difference. New genetic insight broke up this huge genus and made it more consistent with the principles of monophyletic genera and evolutionary relationships.

Several times before, a splitting up has been attempted, but there were always too many intermediate forms. In 2004 the genera &quot;Acianthera&quot;, &quot;Ancipitia&quot;, &quot;Antilla&quot;, &quot;Apoda-prorepentia&quot;, &quot;Areldia&quot;, &quot;Atopoglossum&quot;, &quot;Brenesia&quot;, &quot;Crocodeilanthe&quot; were created, incorporating a large number of former &quot;Pleurothallis&quot; species. The subgenera &quot;Pleurothallis&quot; and &quot;Specklinia&quot; are becoming separate genera, and the subgenus &quot;Acuminatae&quot; might become the proposed genus &quot;Anathallis&quot;.

Other allied genera include &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Masdevallia&quot;, &quot;Restrepia&quot;, and &quot;Stelis&quot;.

==Species==

, Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online listed around 555 species in the genus. Selected species include:

<doc id="216646" wikidata="Q2462315" url="?curid=216646" title="Yasin al-Hashimi">
<text>Yasin al-Hashimi (born Yasin Hilmi Salman; ‎; 1884 – 21 January 1937) was an Iraqi military officer and politician who twice served as Prime Minister of Iraq. Like many of Iraq&#x27;s early leaders, al-Hashimi served as a military officer during the Ottoman control of the country. He made his political debut under the government of his predecessor, Jafar al-Askari, and replaced him as prime minister shortly after, in August 1924. Al-Hashimi served for ten months before he was replaced, in turn by Abdul Muhsin al-Sa&#x27;dun. Over the next ten years he filled a variety of governmental positions finally returning to the office of prime minister in March 1935. On 30 October 1936, Hashimi became the first Iraqi prime minister to be deposed in a coup, which was led by General Bakr Sidqi and a coalition of ethnic minorities. Unlike al-Askari, who was then his minister of defense, al-Hashimi survived the coup and made his way to Beirut, Lebanon, where he died three months later. His older brother and close ally, Taha al-Hashimi, served as Prime Minister of Iraq in 1941.

==Early life and family==
Al-Hashimi was born as &quot;Yasin Hilmi&quot; in Baghdad in 1884, during Ottoman rule. His father, Sayyid Salman, was the mukhtar (headman) of the Barudiyya Quarter of Baghdad and claimed descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The family was middle class, Sunni Muslim and ethnically Arab, although the family&#x27;s claim of Arab descent has been disputed. According to historian Muhammad Y. Muslih, the family were descendants of the Turkish Karawiyya tribe that settled in Iraq in the 17th century.

==Military career==
===Ottoman service===
He enrolled into the Ottoman Military Academy of Istanbul and graduated in 1902. During his time in the academy, he adopted the &quot;nisba&quot; (surname) &quot;al-Hashimi&quot; in reference to the religiously prestigious Banu Hashim tribe of Muhammad, from which his family claimed descent. He performed well at the academy and was recognized for his military skills. In 1913 he was stationed in Mosul and joined al-Ahd, an underground Arab nationalist society composed of Ottoman Arab officers. The branch in Mosul had been founded by al-Hashimi&#x27;s brother Taha and was led by al-Hashimi. Among the officers under al-Hashimi&#x27;s command were future Iraqi statesmen and military figures, including Mawlad Mukhlis, Ali Jawdat al-Aiyubi and Jamil al-Midfai. Through al-Hashimi as a liaison, al-Ahd developed relations with al-Fatat, an underground Arab nationalist society based in Damascus, which al-Hashimi joined in 1915 during a trip to Syria following the outbreak of World War I. Al-Fatat was allied with Emir Faisal, a leader of the Sharifian Army and a contender for establishing a monarchy over a united state consisting of the Ottomans&#x27; Arab territories.

He was loyal to the Ottomans throughout World War I, during which the Ottomans were part of the Central Powers alliance. While he was based in Tulkarm, al-Hashimi was asked by Faisal to join the Sharifian Army, but he refused, stating he could not abandon his military duties. Despite his Arab nationalist affiliations, he opposed a plot by the nationalists to kill Jamal Pasha, despite his awareness that Jamal Pasha was intent on crushing the Arab nationalist movement. In 1917, he commanded an Ottoman division at Galicia during the Russian offensive. He was recognized for his successes against the Russians during that campaign, including by German Emperor Wilhelm II, and subsequently promoted to major general.

In 1918 al-Hashimi was assigned as the commander of the Ottoman Fourth Army garrison in Tulkarm. That year, in the spring, he commanded Ottoman troops against the British-led offensive in Amman and al-Salt. He was wounded during these battles and sent to Damascus to recover. The British and their Arab allies in the Sharifian Army defeated the Ottomans and an armistice was concluded in October 1918. He attempted to resume his service in the Ottoman Army, but was refused because he did not apply for readmission within a year of the armistice.

===Chief of Staff of the Arab Army===
Al-Hashimi&#x27;s refusal to join Faisal&#x27;s army came despite promises of support he gave to Faisal in 1915. Of all the personalities Faisal met in his 1915 Damascus trip, it was al-Hashimi&#x27;s assertion of support at the home of Nasib al-Bakri that convinced Faisal to launch the revolt. As the chief of staff of mostly Arab units in the Ottomans&#x27; Arab provinces, al-Hashimi&#x27;s word carried weight and when Faisal offered to support al-Hashimi&#x27;s units with Hejazi tribal fighters, al-Hashimi replied that he had &quot;no need of them&quot;, but just wanted Faisal &quot;to lead us and be in the vanguard&quot;.

After Faisal&#x27;s entry into Damascus in October 1918 and the setting up of a provisional Arab government under his leadership, Faisal appointed al-Hashimi as President of the Military Council. He was also given the additional office of Secretary of Military Affairs and was charged with the recruitment of volunteers into the newly formed Arab Army to counter potential challenges by the French, who sought to rule Syria. At this time al-Hashimi assumed leadership over al-Ahd&#x27;s Iraqi-dominated wing, which gave him further control over many Iraqi ex-Ottoman officers. Under his leadership, al-Ahd began a vociferous campaign opposed to French and British rule in Syria and Mesopotamia, respectively. Without coordinating with Faisal and after the latter left for Europe for negotiations with the European powers, al-Hashimi launched a mass conscription campaign aimed at adding 12,000 new troops to the Arab Army. The French requested al-Hashimi&#x27;s arrest for his recruitment drive, but the British refused. However, British General Edmund Allenby managed to end al-Hashimi&#x27;s efforts, which were disavowed by Faisal&#x27;s government.

Al-Hashimi soon re-launched efforts to recruit Arab soldiers, but at a more clandestine level, and was boosted by Sheikh Kamil al-Qassab&#x27;s drive to create popular militias in Damascus and throughout the country. Al-Hashimi&#x27;s actions were driven by a desire to boost his nationalist credentials to compensate for his previous hesitance to join Faisal&#x27;s army, and as a means to gain more power. He became the clear leader of the ardent Arab nationalist camp and was accused by the British of coordinating with Turkish General Mustafa Kemal on ending European control in Syria in pursuit of personal power.

===Arrest by the British and return to Syria===
In late November 1919, al-Hashimi was arrested by the British military for recruiting soldiers to resist the French in the Beqaa Valley, suspicions that he was in contact with Mustafa Kemal, who was fighting the French in Turkey, and for leading an anti-British propaganda campaign in Iraq. Al-Hashimi&#x27;s arrest was not formal; rather, he was kidnapped by British authorities after being invited to the British military headquarters in Mezzeh for a meeting and then taken to Haifa, after which he was moved to different places in Palestine under strict British supervision. His arrest precipitated a crisis in Faisal&#x27;s government and provoked protests and riots in Damascus. The British military had been present in Syria since October 1918, but after agreements with the French, who were to assume a mandate over Syria, the British withdrew in December 1919. The loss of British protection left Faisal&#x27;s government more vulnerable to a French takeover. War Minister Yusuf al-&#x27;Azma replaced al-Hashimi following his arrest.

The British authorities informed Faisal that they arrested al-Hashimi for attempting to create a republic and overthrow Faisal and his government; al-Hashimi had grown powerful and had wielded more influence over the army than Faisal. The Syrian National Congress condemned al-Hashimi&#x27;s arrest and condemned Prime Minister Ali Rida al-Rikabi for his apparent apathetic attitude to the arrest. Al-Rikabi held a more conciliatory view toward the European powers and was ultimately pressured to resign on 10 December.

Al-Hashimi was allowed to return to Syria via Egypt in early May 1920. By then, a French offensive to capture Damascus was impending. Al-Hashimi was tasked by Faisal, who declared himself King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920, with inspecting the state of the Arab Army under al-&#x27;Azma&#x27;s command. Upon inspecting the Arab troops, al-Hashimi concluded that they were not prepared to confront an invasion by the militarily superior French forces. Al-Hashimi particularly noted the lack of arms and that the Arab Army&#x27;s soldiers only possessed enough ammunition to fight for two hours. He refused an assignment by Faisal to command the Arab Army&#x27;s post at Majdal Anjar in the Beqaa Valley and also turned down a request to resume his position as chief-of-staff due to the precarious position of the army. In response to Faisal&#x27;s inquiry about the cause of the lack of arms and ammunition, al-Hashimi responded that the French were in control of Syria&#x27;s ports, the British controlled Palestine, the Transjordan region, and Iraq, and the Turks were occupied by their war in Anatolia, and thus Syria was effectively blocked from importing weaponry. In a meeting of the army&#x27;s General Staff, al-&#x27;Azma rejected al-Hashimi&#x27;s assessment and accused him of bitterness as a result of his secondary role in the army. Ultimately, however, al-&#x27;Azma and the General Staff officers understood the weak state of the army.

French forces launched their offensive in mid-July, and al-&#x27;Azma decided to rally whatever troops and local volunteers he could assemble to confront the French. Al-Hashimi, firmly believing that the Arab Army could not hold out against the French, remained in Damascus, while al-&#x27;Azma&#x27;s forces encountered the French in what became known as the Battle of Maysalun. The Arabs were decisively defeated, al-&#x27;Azma was killed and the French entered Damascus on 25 July.

==Political career in Iraq==
===Governor of Muntafiq===
In March 1922, al-Hashimi arrived in Baghdad, where Faisal had been relocated and assumed power as King of Iraq. In June 1922, Faisal assigned al-Hashimi as Mutassarif (Governor) of Liwa Muntafiq (Muntafiq Province). He was subsequently posted at the capital of the province, an-Nasiriyah. Al-Hashimi was offered a position in Prime Minister Ja&#x27;far al-&#x27;Askari&#x27;s cabinet in October 1923, but after he stated that he could not guarantee his support for the 1922 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, the offer was withdrawn. Al-Hashimi ultimately agreed to recognize the treaty and was appointed to the cabinet in November.

===First premiership===
During the 25 January 1924 constituent assembly election, al-Hashimi won a seat in the assembly. Opposition to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty became evident in the constituent assembly and protests by Iraqi lawyers were held opposing the treaty. According to Gertrude Bell, al-Hashimi, who chaired a special committee to examine and publish an opinion about the treaty, instigated the protests. According to historian Ali al-Allawi, al-Hashimi used his position on the committee &quot;to undermine al-&#x27;Askari&#x27;s cabinet and show it up as a feeble and incompetent government, unable to shepherd the country through trying times.&quot;

The constituent assembly was dissolved on 24 August 1924, following the completion of its main mission, the negotiation and passing of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. Al-&#x27;Askari&#x27;s cabinet resigned on the same day and Faisal appointed al-Hashimi as prime minister. Although Faisal&#x27;s British advisors were wary of al-Hashimi and his loyalties, they acceded to Faisal&#x27;s decision, which was partly motivated by a desire to keep an influential figure like al-Hashimi in Faisal&#x27;s governing party instead of in the opposition. As prime minister, al-Hashimi appointed himself the defense minister and foreign affairs minister. Faisal, as commander-in-chief of the military, countered al-Hashimi&#x27;s appointment to the defense ministry, by assigning loyalist Nuri as-Said as deputy commander of the military.

Another of Faisal&#x27;s motivations in appointing al-Hashimi was his view that al-Hashimi&#x27;s ardent nationalist position made him well-suited to handle the Turkish-Iraqi territorial dispute over the former Mosul Vilayet. At the time of al-Hashimi&#x27;s appointment, the Turkish government agreed to allow the League of Nations to send a commission to then-British-held Mosul to determine which country its inhabitants favored joining and to make recommendations regarding a final settlement of the territorial dispute. The commission decided in July 1925 that Mosul should remain part of Iraq, that Iraq should remain under British Mandatory rule for 25 years and that Kurdish cultural rights and self-administration be recognized by the Iraqi state. Al-Hashimi was replaced by Abd al-Muhsin as-Sa&#x27;dun in June. Al-Hashimi opposed as-Sa&#x27;dun&#x27;s government and in November 1925 founded the People&#x27;s Party (&quot;hizb ash-sha&#x27;b&quot;) to garner opposition to the administration. The People&#x27;s Party opposed British Mandatory rule and pressed for independence and reform.

===Formation of National Brotherhood Party===
In 1930, the Iraqi and British governments began the renegotiation of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty and as a result, the political climate in Iraq became highly charged between the faction calling for gradual independence and cooperation with Britain and those who favored swift independence from Britain. Al-Hashimi was among the principal leaders of the latter camp, while Prime Minister as-Said led the former. As-Said formed the Covenant Party (&quot;hizb al-ahd&quot;), a symbolic nod to the al-Ahd society, to rally support for his policies. Al-Hashimi, meanwhile, sought to muster opposition against as-Said and British rule, establishing the National Brotherhood Party (&quot;hizb al-ikha&#x27; al-watani&quot;) after uniting his People&#x27;s Party with Ja&#x27;far Abu Timman&#x27;s National Party (&quot;hizb al-watani&quot;). According to historian Charles Tripp, the party was formed as an &quot;alliance between two disparate personalities [al-Hashimi and Abu Timman] and linked two parties which drew on different sections of Iraqi society for their support&quot;; the People&#x27;s Party was largely composed of Sunni Muslim Arabs who had work experience in the Ottoman and Iraqi states, while the National Party mostly consisted of educated, urban Shia Muslim Arab laymen with links to the rural Shia tribal sheikhs.

Subsequent to Iraq&#x27;s accession to the League of Nations, King Faisal, in pursuit of domestic reform and consolidation, tried to give opposition groups greater voice in the parliament and cabinet. Thus, the National Brotherhood Party was allowed into power. However, its forfeiture of demands concerning the Ango-Iraqi Treaty and callous management of the Assyrian Affair lost it credence with other reformist groups—particularly many from the National Party. In 1932 Iraq gained its independence from Great Britain and about a year later King Faisal died and was replaced by his son Ghazi. Al-Hashimi&#x27;s party lost power with Ghazi&#x27;s accession, and owing to the failure of traditional methods. In succession, he appointed Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, al-Midfai and al-Aiyubi as prime ministers between 1933 and 1935. During al-Aiyubi&#x27;s premiership, he successfully lobbied King Ghazi to dismiss parliament and he then rigged the parliamentary elections and significantly reduced the National Brotherhood Party&#x27;s representation. In January 1935, a series of Shia tribal uprisings against the government began. Part of the tribesmen&#x27;s demands were that al-Aiyubi resign, which he did when Hikmat Sulayman of the National Brotherhood instructed his ally, General Bakr Sidqi, to withhold military action against the tribesmen. Afterward, al-Hashimi lent his support to the Shia tribal rebellion in Diwaniya against al-Aiyubi&#x27;s successor, al-Midfai. Al-Hashimi instructed his brother and the army chief of staff, Taha, to not suppress the revolts.

===Second premiership===
With Taha&#x27;s withholding of action against the tribal rebels, al-Midfai became convinced that Taha and al-Hashimi had conspired against the government and he consequently resigned. With the uprisings in full swing, King Ghazi appointed al-Hashimi, who was seen as the only person who could stabilize the country, as prime minister in March 1935. The uprisings largely dissipated a week into al-Hashimi&#x27;s appointment. In April, the National Brotherhood Party dissolved itself. In order to coopt the tribal sheikhs who participated in the uprising, al-Hashimi maneuvered to guarantee many of the sheikhs entry into parliament in the August 1935 elections. Thereafter, the sheikhs became key supporters of al-Hashimi as he became their political patron. Tensions between the government and the tribes remained regarding the issue of conscription, which the latter opposed and the former strongly advocated.

When al-Hashimi had the conscription law passed, a Yazidi revolt broke out in Jabal Sinjar against the measure in October. Al-Hashimi declared martial law in Jabal Sinjar and had the revolt suppressed, resulting in the deaths or imprisonment of hundreds of Yazidis and the destruction of several villages. Despite the revolt&#x27;s suppression, the Yazidi population continued to evade conscription orders. Prior to the Yazidi revolt, armed disturbances in the Kurdish-dominated north of the country in August related to intra-tribal divisions and opposition to conscription was ordered to be quelled by al-Hashimi. The Kurdish rising would come to an end in March 1936. A similar uprising by Shia tribes in the lower Euphrates region was also quelled at roughly the same time. According to Tripp, under the leadership of al-Hashimi and General Sidqi, the Iraqi army &quot;crush[ed] the rebellions with a now characteristic ruthlessness&quot;.

Al-Hashimi&#x27;s Arab nationalist credentials during his second premiership were strong enough that he became known as the &quot;Bismark of the Arabs&quot; in Arab nationalist circles. Al-Hashimi&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, particularly in 1936, led to growing dissent and resentment among the ruling elite, including King Ghazi and his former ally Hikmat Sulayman. During the course of 1936, al-Hashimi largely ruled by decree, expanded the police forces and intelligence agencies, and repressed any public disapproval of his government. To the latter end, he shut down the &quot;Al-Ahali&quot; newspaper for publishing criticism of his premiership and prevented demonstrations against his government in Baghdad. He also believed that tribal revolts in some of the country&#x27;s provinces were being coordinated with his political opponents, and used General Sidqi to harshly put them down. Al-Hashimi&#x27;s actions and method of rule fueled disaffection within the army&#x27;s ranks. By late 1936, General Sidqi, frustrated at not being promoted, also grew resentful of al-Hashimi and attributed his lack of hierarchical elevation to al-Hashimi&#x27;s brother, Chief of Staff Taha.

Sidqi and Sulaymani conspired to topple al-Hashimi. They made their move when Taha left for a visit to Turkey and appointed Sidqi as acting chief of staff. Using his interim position, Sidqi had his army units enter Baghdad in a show of force under the banner of the &quot;National Reform Force&quot;, while having leaflets dropped over the city informing residents that the Iraqi Army had instructed King Ghazi to dismiss al-Hashimi and replace him with Sulayman. King Ghazi had likely been informed of the impending coup d&#x27;état against al-Hashimi and lent his quiet support by forbidding any resistance against the army. He did not dismiss al-Hashimi until the latter submitted his resignation following air force bombardment in the vicinity of his office. Sulayman was then appointed by King Ghazi as prime minister.

==Death==
Al-Hashimi was exiled from Iraq following the 1936 Bakr Sidqi coup and moved to Lebanon, then under French Mandatory rule. On the morning of 21 January 1937, al-Hashimi died in a Beirut hospital in the presence of his brother Taha after experiencing two heart attacks. Immediately after his death, his doctor sent telegrams informing numerous Arab leaders and organizations, including King Ghazi, Emir Abdullah I of Transjordan, Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, the government of Egypt and the National Bloc of Syria. The al-Hashimi family requested from King Ghazi that al-Hashimi be buried in Iraq, but after initial hesitation from the Iraqi government, a group of Lebanese dignitaries advised the family to instead have al-Hashimi buried in Damascus. Doctors from the American University in Beirut (AUB) embalmed al-Hashimi&#x27;s body and the Syrian authorities prepared a burial plot for the body adjacent to the Mausoleum of Saladin.

===Funeral===
On the morning of 22 January, the first leg of al-Hashimi&#x27;s funeral procession began, with his Arab flag-draped coffin being carried by students of the AUB from his home in Ras Beirut toward the Omari Mosque in the city. The procession in Lebanon was led by the Muslim Boy Scouts and the Lebanese police force and included Lebanese dignitaries, Taha al-Hashimi, the consuls of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and a Damascene delegation led by parliament member Fakhri al-Barudi. A prayer was then held at the Omari Mosque and an AUB student read a poem dedicated to al-Hashimi. Non-Muslim Lebanese dignitaries also attended the prayer, including former Prime Minister Beshara al-Khoury. From the Omari Mosque, al-Hashimi&#x27;s body was transported to Damascus. Prior to its arrival to the city, the funeral cortege made a symbolic stop in Maysalun, at the tomb of Yusuf al-Azma, to commemorate the fallen Arab soldiers and volunteers who died in the battle against the French.

Al-Hashimi&#x27;s cortege was greeted by thousands of spectators once it arrived in Damascus, with reports from the local &quot;Al-Qabas&quot; newspaper reporting that the number of participants in the city was unprecedented. Participants in the procession, included Boy Scouts, Orthodox Boy Scouts, Kurdish Boy Scouts, Iron Shirts (a youth movement affiliated with the National Bloc founded by al-Barudi), the youth movement of the League of National Action, students from the Syrian University and Damascene secondary schools, police units, and large crowds of residents. Also in attendance was Prime Minister Jamil Mardam Bey, the British vice consul, the Saudi consul, representatives of the various Christian patriarchates, the leader of the Damascene Jewish community, Palestinian leaders Izzat Darwaza and Akram Zuaiter.

Prior to the Damascus procession, the Iraqi government communicated its approval of interring al-Hashimi&#x27;s body in Baghdad after mourning ceremonies in Beirut and Damascus, but forbade Taha&#x27;s participation in the final funeral procession. The al-Hashimi family accepted the Iraqi government&#x27;s conditions. However, following the funeral procession in Damascus, disagreements between the Iraqi and Syrian governments prevented al-Hashimi&#x27;s body from being transported to its intended final resting place in Baghdad. The Syrian government denied that there was a conflict with the Iraqi government and cited unsuitable road conditions due to heavy rainfall as the reason al-Hashimi&#x27;s body could not be transported to Baghdad, but it is well known that the mutual antagonism between the two governments precluded the al-Hashimi family&#x27;s initial wishes for al-Hashimi&#x27;s burial. Al-Hashimi was laid in state at the shrine of Husayn ibn Ali in the courtyard of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. On 27 January, al-Hashimi&#x27;s family agreed to have him buried at the Mausoleum of Saladin, adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque.

<text>A ferrimagnetic material is a material that has populations of atoms with opposing magnetic moments, as in antiferromagnetism, but these moments are unequal in magnitude, so a spontaneous magnetization remains. This can for example occur when the populations consist of different atoms or ions (such as Fe2+ and Fe3+).

Like ferromagnetic substances, ferrimagnetic substances are attracted by magnets and can be magnetized to make permanent magnets. The oldest known magnetic substance, magnetite (Fe3O4), is ferrimagnetic, but was classified as a ferromagnet before Louis Néel discovered ferrimagnetism in 1948. Since the discovery, numerous uses have been found for ferrimagnetic materials, such as hard-drive platters and biomedical applications.

== History ==
Until the twentieth century, all naturally occurring magnetic substances were called ferromagnets. In 1936, Louis Néel published a paper proposing the existence of a new form of cooperative magnetism he called antiferromagnetism. While working with Mn2Sb, French physicist Charles Guillaud discovered that the current theories on magnetism were not adequate to explain the behavior of the material, and made a model to explain the behavior. In 1948, Néel published a paper about a third type of cooperative magnetism, based on the assumptions in Guillaud&#x27;s model. He called it ferrimagnetism. In 1970, Néel was awarded for his work in magnetism with the Nobel Prize in Physics.

== Physical origin ==

Ferrimagnetism has the same physical origins as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In ferrimagnetic materials the magnetization is also caused by a combination of dipole–dipole interactions and exchange interactions resulting from the Pauli exclusion principle. The main difference is that in ferrimagnetic materials there are different types of atoms in the material&#x27;s unit cell. An example of this can be seen in the figure above. Here the atoms with a smaller magnetic moment point in the opposite direction of the larger moments. This arrangement is similar to that present in antiferromagnetic materials, but in ferrimagnetic materials the net moment is nonzero because the opposed moments differ in magnitude.

Ferrimagnets have a critical temperature above which they become paramagnetic just as ferromagnets do. At this temperature (called the Curie temperature) there is a second-order phase transition, and the system can no longer maintain a spontaneous magnetization. This is because at higher temperatures the thermal motion is strong enough that it exceeds the tendency of the dipoles to align.

== Derivation ==
There are various ways to describe ferrimagnets, the simplest of which is with mean-field theory. In mean-field theory the field acting on the atoms can be written as

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the applied magnetic field, and formula_3 is field caused by the interactions between the atoms. The following assumption then is formula_4

Here formula_5 is the average magnetization of the lattice, and formula_6 is the molecular field coefficient. When we allow formula_5 and formula_6 to be position- and orientation-dependent, we can then write it in the form

: formula_9

where formula_10 is the field acting on the &quot;i&quot;-th substructure, and formula_11 is the molecular field coefficient between the &quot;i&quot;-th and &quot;k&quot;-th substructures. For a diatomic lattice we can designate two types of sites, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. We can designate formula_12 the number of magnetic ions per unit volume, formula_13 the fraction of the magnetic ions on the &quot;a&quot; sites, and formula_14 the fraction on the &quot;b&quot; sites. This then gives

: formula_15

It can be shown that formula_16 and that formula_17 unless the structures are identical. formula_18 favors a parallel alignment of formula_19 and formula_20, while formula_21 favors an anti-parallel alignment. For ferrimagnets, formula_21, so it will be convenient to take formula_23 as a positive quantity and write the minus sign explicitly in front of it. For the total fields on &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; this then gives

: formula_24
: formula_25

Furthermore, we will introduce the parameters formula_26 and formula_27 which give the ratio between the strengths of the interactions. At last we will introduce the reduced magnetizations

: formula_28
: formula_29

with formula_30 the spin of the &quot;i&quot;-th element. This then gives for the fields:

: formula_31
: formula_32

The solutions to these equations (omitted here) are then given by

: formula_33
: formula_34

where formula_35 is the Brillouin function. The simplest case to solve now is formula_36. Since formula_37, this then gives the following pair of equations:

: formula_38
: formula_39

with formula_40 and formula_41. These equations do not have a known analytical solution, so they must be solved numerically to find the temperature dependence of formula_42.

==Effects of temperature==
Unlike ferromagnetism, the magnetization curves of ferrimagnetism can take many different shapes depending on the strength of the interactions and the relative abundance of atoms. The most notable instances of this property are that the direction of magnetization can reverse while heating a ferrimagnetic material from absolute zero to its critical temperature, and that strength of magnetization can increase while heating a ferrimagnetic material to the critical temperature, both of which cannot occur for ferromagnetic materials. These temperature dependencies have also been experimentally observed in NiFe2/5Cr8/5O4 and Li1/2Fe5/4Ce5/4O4.

A temperature lower than the Curie temperature, but at which the opposing magnetic moments are equal (resulting in a net magnetic moment of zero) is called a magnetization compensation point. This compensation point is observed easily in garnets and rare-earth–transition-metal alloys (RE-TM). Furthermore, ferrimagnets may also have an angular momentum compensation point, at which the net angular momentum vanishes. This compensation point is crucial for achieving fast magnetization reversal in magnetic-memory devices.

== Effect of external fields ==
When ferrimagnets are exposed to an external magnetic field, they display what is called magnetic hysteresis, where magnetic behavior depends on the history of the magnet. They also exhibit a saturation magnetization formula_43; this magnetization is reached when the external field is strong enough to make all the moments align in the same direction. When this point is reached, the magnetization cannot increase, as there are no more moments to align. When the external field is removed, the magnetization of the ferrimagnet does not disappear, but a nonzero magnetization remains. This effect is often used in applications of magnets. If an external field in the opposite direction is applied subsequently, the magnet will demagnetize further until it eventually reaches a magnetization of formula_44. This behavior results in what is called a &quot;hysteresis loop&quot;.

==Properties and uses==
Ferrimagnetic materials have high resistivity and have anisotropic properties. The anisotropy is actually induced by an external applied field. When this applied field aligns with the magnetic dipoles, it causes a net magnetic dipole moment and causes the magnetic dipoles to precess at a frequency controlled by the applied field, called &quot;Larmor&quot; or &quot;precession frequency&quot;. As a particular example, a microwave signal circularly polarized in the same direction as this precession strongly interacts with the magnetic dipole moments; when it is polarized in the opposite direction, the interaction is very low. When the interaction is strong, the microwave signal can pass through the material. This directional property is used in the construction of microwave devices like isolators, circulators, and gyrators. Ferrimagnetic materials are also used to produce optical isolators and circulators. Ferrimagnetic minerals in various rock types are used to study ancient geomagnetic properties of Earth and other planets. That field of study is known as paleomagnetism. In addition, it has been shown that ferrimagnets such as magnetite can be used for thermal energy storage.

== Examples ==
The oldest known magnetic material, magnetite, is a ferrimagnetic substance. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites of its crystal structure exhibit opposite spin. Other known ferrimagnetic materials include yttrium iron garnet (YIG); cubic ferrites composed of iron oxides with other elements such as aluminum, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and zinc; and hexagonal or spinel type ferrites, including rhenium ferrite, ReFe2O4, PbFe12O19 and BaFe12O19 and pyrrhotite, Fe1−&quot;x&quot;S.

Ferrimagnetism can also occur in single-molecule magnets. A classic example is a dodecanuclear manganese molecule with an effective spin &quot;S&quot; = 10 derived from antiferromagnetic interaction on Mn(IV) metal centers with Mn(III) and Mn(II) metal centers.

<doc id="216655" wikidata="Q1853405" url="?curid=216655" title="List of universities and colleges in Sweden">
<text>This list of [[university|universities]] in [[Sweden]] is based on the Higher Education Ordinance of 1993 (as amended until January 2006). With few exceptions, all higher education in Sweden is publicly funded.

The Swedish higher education system differentiates between &quot;universitet&quot; and &quot;högskola&quot; (university and university college respectively). The universities are research-oriented and may award Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s, and Doctor&#x27;s degrees in many academic fields, whereas the högskolor usually are more focused on applied sciences, and only have limited rights granting doctor&#x27;s degrees. Note, however, that some universities still call themselves &quot;högskola&quot; in Swedish, mainly older specialised institutions in engineering and medicine (for instance KTH Royal Institute of Technology is called &quot;Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan&quot; and Chalmers University of Technology is called &quot;Chalmers Tekniska Högskola&quot;). Also, both proper universities and högskolor are translated to &quot;university&quot; in English, where in the latter case, some argue that &quot;university college&quot; would be more correct.

==Public universities==
The order of precedence is based on their year of establishment as a university. Only Uppsala University (est. 1477) and Lund University (est. 1666) were actually founded as &quot;universities&quot;, whereas all the other universities were raised from &quot;högskola&quot; (university college) status to the higher university status after they had been founded.

Two universities founded under Swedish rule, the University of Tartu from 1632 (now in Estonia) and the Royal Academy of Turku from 1640 (later established as University of Helsinki, now in Finland), as well as the University of Greifswald from 1456 (now in Germany but a fief held by Sweden 1631–1806, Swedish 1806–1815), are excluded from the list.

Växjö University (1967–2009) was a university that has now merged with Kalmar University (1977–2009), becoming the Linnaeus University in 2010.

==Public university colleges==
A Högskola (= &quot;university college&quot; in English) is an institution of higher education, similar to a university but typically smaller and with PhD-rights in fewer areas. The right to award doctoral degrees is in Sweden given and monitored by the Swedish Higher Education Authority in the same way for universities and university colleges. The public &#x27;högskola&#x27; are:
* Gotland University College (1998–2013) was a &quot;högskola&quot; that has now merged with Uppsala university, becoming the Gotland campus of Uppsala university.
* Kalmar University (1977–2009) was a &quot;högskola&quot; that has now merged with Växjö University (1967–2009), becoming the Linnaeus University in 2010.

==Private universities and högskolor==
There are seven private institutions of higher education with the right to give post graduate degrees, namely:
* Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg,
* Ersta Sköndal Bräcke University College,
* Johannelund School of Theology in Uppsala,
* Jönköping University Foundation,
* Stockholm School of Economics and
* Sophiahemmet University College and
* University College Stockholm (Enskilda Högskolan Stockholm).

During the Cold War era, it specialised in the provision of defense systems engineering and facilities management services, including the maintenance of sonar, early warning radar and satellite systems. Following a management buyout, the firm changed to the name Serco (&#x27;Services Company&#x27;) in 1987 and was listed on the London Stock Exchange one year later. The company was restructured during the 1980s, reorientated itself towards services beyond engineering, and expanded its presence globally.

Serco has encountered controversy, described by legal services firm Appleby as a &quot;history of problems, failures, fatal errors and overcharging&quot;. During 2013, then-chairman Alastair Lyons resigned from the company after it was found that it had overcharged the UK Government for electronically monitoring criminals. Serco underwent a corporate renewal programme during the 2010s, created in collaboration with the United Kingdom government, which overhauled the management of contracts and commercial auditing.

== History ==
===RCA Services===
Serco was founded in 1929 as &quot;RCA Services Limited&quot;, a British-based division of the Radio Corporation of America, and initially provided technical services to the cinema industry.

RCA Services Limited began providing services to government departments during the Second World War. After the onset of the conflict, the company was contracted by the British War Office due to the company&#x27;s engineering and technical background to supply the department with equipment which would simulate the sound of warfare to confuse the enemy. During 1952, RCA Services was contracted to produce submarine-detecting sonar equipment for the United States Navy. In 1960, it was awarded the contract to design, install, and maintain the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, including ongoing facility management such as cleaning, transport, and logistical stores.

In the 1980s, the European Space Agency contracted RCA Services to support and maintain computer systems and satellites.

===Reinvention as a management company===
By the 1980s, RCA Services began to interpret their company product as the management, rather than being just an engineering and science company. For their MoD Radar contract at RAF Fylingdales, &quot;the art, it turned out, was in running the people, not the radar.&quot; During 1984, RCA Services was awarded the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s first outsourcing contract, under which it managed warehousing using the knowledge of staff who had completed similar work at RAF Flyingdales.

Following the takeover of RCA by General Electric in late 1985, RCA Services Limited was bought out by its local management. During 1987, the firm changed its name to Serco (&#x27;Services Company&#x27;) and became a London Stock Exchange listed company one year later. By 1990s, Serco had expanded from the United Kingdom and Europe, developing a global presence with major activities in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, and North America.

During December 2008, Serco acquired SI International, a provider of IT services to the United States government in exchange for $524 million.

===Controversies and restructuring===
During 2013, both Serco and its competitor G4S were found to have maintained inaccurate records and overcharged the UK Government for electronically monitoring criminals. In November 2014, its share price, which stood at 674p before the taxpayer scandal broke in 2013, collapsed to 218.7p, after four profit warnings. That same month, it was announced that Alastair Lyons, the chairman of Serco, was resigning from his position. Speaking at the time, Lyons referred to &quot;operational mis-steps&quot; for which he took &quot;ultimate responsibility&quot;, but said he had not been forced out.

In 2014, Serco incurred a loss of £991million, which was followed by a smaller loss of £69.4million in 2015. In response, Rupert Soames, Lyons&#x27;s successor as chief executive, sold off &quot;scores of divisions&quot;. Soames stated that Serco was suffering from ministers’ improved ability at driving a bargain, and claimed that &quot;the Government has got much more adept at writing contracts and transferring risk to the private sector&quot;. Following an 8-year long investigation and trial, Serco&#x27;s executives at the time were cleared of fraud charges in April 2021.

===Corporate renewal===
Following the events of 2013, Serco underwent a Corporate Renewal Programme designed by the company and the United Kingdom government which overhauled the company&#x27;s contract management and auditing processes. By 2019, Cabinet Office publicised that &quot;the remedial actions taken in 2013-14 were sufficient with regard to this incidence of wrongdoing&quot;.

During September 2017, Serco announced that it was in the process of combining its UK and Europe operations.

John Rishton was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman in Spring 2021, succeeding Sir Roy Gardner who held the position from May 2015. Rishton had been on the Board since September 2016.

In August 2022, Serco announced that it would distribute £9million in one-off payments to about 45,000 non-management staff as the firm lifted its profit guidance and dividend; this amount equated to around £200 for each of its 45,000 workers.

In December 2023, Serco acquired European Homecare, a specialist provider of immigration services to public sector customers in Germany, for €40 million (£34 million).

== UK operations ==

=== Defence ===

By 2004, Serco held numerous defence contracts, including the UK Government&#x27;s contract for the maintenance of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System at RAF Fylingdales. The MoD extended Serco&#x27;s contract in October 2022 for a further three years, under which the company provides maintenance, repair, and operational services for the radar in Yorkshire, England. Serco has contracts for the operation and maintenance of RAF Brize Norton, RAF Halton, RAF Northolt and RNAS Culdrose in the UK and RAF Ascension Island in the mid-Atlantic.

Serco provides support services to garrisons in Australia. Serco manages many aspects of operations at the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom in Shrivenham. Prior to June 2021, Serco was one of three partners in the consortium who managed the Atomic Weapons Establishment until it was taken over by the MoD: in July 2015, the Office for Nuclear Regulation issued an improvement notice to the consortium demanding that it demonstrate that it has a long-term strategy for managing Higher Active radioactive Waste in order to reduce the risk to the public and its employees.

Serco is a major subcontractor to Airbus Defence and Space on the Skynet military communications satellites under a private finance initiative (PFI) contract.

Serco Marine Services is responsible for fleet support at the three main UK naval bases, HMNB Portsmouth, HMNB Devonport and HMNB Clyde. In November 2022, the MoD awarded Serco a £200million follow-on contract, lasting 27months, to provide marine services for the Royal Navy.

=== Transport ===

In London, Serco has operated the London Cycle Hire Scheme for Transport for London since it was first introduced in 2010. During December 2022, Serco signed a three-year contract extension valued at £50million to continue maintaining and distributing the bikes, including the newly introduced e-Bikes.

Serco has operated a number of train operating companies. It has a 50% shareholding in Serco-Abellio that has a concession to operate the Merseyrail franchise in Liverpool until 2028, and previously operated the Northern Rail franchise from December 2004 until March 2016. Between April 2015 and June 2023, Serco operated the &quot;Caledonian Sleeper&quot; between London and Scotland; the contract was terminated early after Serco&#x27;s request to rebase the loss making contract was deemed by Transport Scotland to not offer value.

In 1997, Serco purchased the Railtest business as part of the privatisation of British Rail. Included in the sale was a management contract for the Old Dalby Test Track. Between 1997 and 2004, Serco operated the National Rail Enquiry Service under contract to the Association of Train Operating Companies. It maintains Network Rail&#x27;s fleet of infrastructure and maintenance trains at the Railway Technical Centre.

In Scotland, Serco has operated the NorthLink Ferries ferry service since July 2012. In September 2018, the firm commenced operating a bicycle-sharing system under contract to Transport for Edinburgh; these scheme was closed during September 2021.

Serco&#x27;s Home Affairs division operates speed camera systems throughout the UK and, until November 2013, designed, wrote and tested the software that controls the matrix message signs, signals, emergency roadside telephones (SOS) and traffic monitoring on England&#x27;s motorway network including, until 2011, the National Traffic Control Centre.

Starting in 1997, Serco operated the London&#x27;s Docklands Light Railway (DLR) under franchise. In November 2005, TfL announced that Serco had retained the DLR franchise for seven years from May 2006; this contract was extended until September 2014 in January 2013. However, in July 2014, the DLR franchise was awarded to KeolisAmey Docklands Limited, thus Serco handed over operations on 7 December 2014.

Serco operated Scatsta Airport in Shetland until its closure in 2020. During June 2010, Serco signed a £4million contract to operate all air traffic control services for Coventry Airport.

=== Border security ===

Serco was part of a consortium called Trusted Borders, led by Raytheon Systems Limited, to put in place e-Borders under a contract awarded by the UK Home Office in 2007. As a subcontractor to Raytheon, Serco was responsible for delivering the infrastructure and service management of e-Borders; Raytheon had its contract terminated in July 2010 and Serco at the time stated it had fulfilled all its commitments on the contract.

=== Work and pensions ===

Serco was contracted to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to provide telephone advice on behalf of DWP to recipients of Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI), which ended in April 2018.

=== Science ===

Prior to 2015, Serco managed the UK&#x27;s National Physical Laboratory. It currently provides IT Services, Industrial Support and Cryogenic Operations Support and Maintenance at CERN. Serco was part of a consortium that ran the UK&#x27;s National Nuclear Laboratory under contract up until October 2013.

=== Prisons and justice ===
In Britain, Serco supplies electronic tagging devices for offenders and asylum seekers. Serco, as well as its rival G4S, was accused of overcharging the Ministry of Justice on its contract to tag offenders. The firm issued a profit warning for 2014 as a result of the costs of becoming embroiled in an electronic tagging scandal. Serco repaid £68.5million to the government for its overcharging on the contract. In May 2014, a Survation poll for the campaign group &quot;We Own It&quot;, found that 63% of respondents thought Serco should be banned from bidding for any new public contracts after the firm was investigated for overcharging on government contracts.

Serco runs four prisons, a Young Offenders Institution and a Secure Training Centre. It has operated two Immigration Removal Centres since 2007. Serco is responsible for the contracted-out court escort services in the south-east area, formerly a role undertaken by HM Prison Service.

In September 2013, Serco was accused of an extensive cover-up over sexual abuse at Yarl&#x27;s Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedfordshire, England. During August 2014, it was criticised for using immigrant detainees as cheap labour, with some being paid as little as £1 per hour. The decision to award Serco a new £70million eight-year contract to run Yarl&#x27;s Wood has been criticised; Natasha Walter, of Women for Refugee Women, said
&quot;Serco is clearly unfit to manage a centre where vulnerable women are held and it is unacceptable the government continues to entrust Serco with the safety of women who are survivors of sexual violence.&quot;

During 2019, a fine of £19.2million was imposed on Serco following delayed legal action started in 2013 for fraud and false accounting over its electronic tagging service for the Ministry of Justice. Serco was also ordered to pay the full amount of the Serious Fraud Office&#x27;s investigative costs of £3.7million. In his judgment, Mr Justice Davis said: &quot;SGL (Serco Geografix Ltd) engaged in quite deliberate fraud against the Ministry of Justice in relation to the provision of services vital to the criminal justice system.&quot; During April 2021, the charged ex-directors of firm&#x27;s subsidiary were cleared of fraud and false accounting, primarily due to the SFO having failed to disclose certain documents to the defense, resulting in issues that, according to the judge, &quot;undermine the process of disclosure to the extent that the trial cannot safely and fairly proceed until they have been remedied&quot;.

In July 2022, the company supplied food containing maggots to children in a hotel in the Midlands. Serco issued an apology and said it would visit the hotel.

In October 2024, Serco’s tracking devices and panic alarms on prison vans were disabled after a cyber attack. Allegedly, some Serco crews were unaware that vehicles were still being used to transport prisoners for three days after the attack despite continuing software faults.

In December 2024, Serco was accused of failing to tag 77year old climate protestor Gaie Delap after her release on licence from HMP Peterborough, resulting in her being recalled to custody. Her supporters argued that Serco had failed to supply a tag small enough for her averagesized wrist since she could not be tagged on her ankle for medical reasons. They also accused Serco of misrepresenting the reason for its failure to tag Delap, after falsely claiming she had refused to cooperate with its fitting. In January2025, Delap discovered that she would have to serve a further 20days in prison, the amount of time Serco had previously spent unsuccessfully trying to find a suitable bracelet.

=== Housing ===

During August 2018, it was disclosed that Serco had been planning to evict asylum seekers in Glasgow before their appeal procedure was completed; the legality of such actions under Scottish law was questioned by lawyers. Serco confirmed that it was serving a notice of eviction on many tenants, causing alarm and lawyers challenged one asylum seeker&#x27;s eviction at the Scottish Court of Session. Councillor Jennifer Layden, equalities and human rights convener for Glasgow, said, &quot;The lock change announcement by the Home Office and Serco has caused widespread fear and alarm among asylum seekers in Glasgow. There is confusion and panic among the community – some of whom have limited English and who may not be affected by Serco’s announcement. Both Serco and the Home Office have a responsibility to put this vulnerable group at ease&quot;. Two asylum seekers started a hunger strike.

In January 2019, it was reported that Serco had lost the contract to provide housing to asylum seekers in Glasgow. That same year, a Freedom of Information request by the Scottish Refugee Council showed that Serco had been charged nearly £3million by the Home Office for repeatedly breaching its contract to house asylum seekers in Glasgow and Northern Ireland.

=== Health ===

Serco provide facilities management services at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Leicester Royal Infirmary, and Wishaw General Hospital.

The company held the contract for out-of-hours GP services in Cornwall from which it withdrew in December 2013 after the company left the county short of doctors. Serco also stated that it would stop running Braintree hospital in Essex as it opted to pull out of managing GP services and large hospitals.

In health services, Serco&#x27;s failures include the poor handling of pathology labs and fatal errors in patient records. At St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, the increase in the number of clinical incidents arising from Serco non-clinical management has resulted in patients receiving incorrect and infected blood, as well as patients suffering kidney damage due to Serco providing incorrect data used for medical calculations. A Serco employee later revealed that the company had falsified 252 reports to the National Health Service regarding Serco health services in Cornwall.

During November 2013, it emerged that Serco, which been awarded a contract for Suffolk Community Healthcare in 2012, had 72 job vacancies after previously cutting 137 positions. Problems identified by Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group include &quot;staff capacity, skill mix, workload, succession planning and morale, training, communication, mobile working, care co-ordination centre processes, incidents and near miss incidents&quot;.

In April 2014, Serco revealed that it would lose almost £18million on three of its NHS contracts. It had made provisions for losses in its Braintree and Cornwall contracts, which were cancelled early, and had also made provisions for losses in its contract for services in Suffolk. Serco claimed it would take longer to deliver the operational efficiencies it hoped for, despite stating in May 2013 that it expected to make a profit on the three-year, £140million contract for community services. It said that staff had not recorded activity accurately on the Electronic health record and that activity had increased significantly during the course of the contract.

In August 2014, the company had reportedly decided to withdraw from the clinical health services market in the UK after a review of the cost of delivering &quot;improved service levels&quot; and meeting the performance requirements of several existing contracts.

During October 2017, it was reported that Serco was preparing to buy healthcare contracts from facilities management business Carillion. This deal included 15 contracts, with annual revenues of approximately £90million, for which Serco would pay £47.7million, with Carillion losing £1billion from the value of its order book.

In May 2020, Serco accidentally shared the personal email addresses of nearly 300 trainee COVID-19 contact tracers.

=== Education ===

Between 2001 and 2011, Serco held a ten-year contract with Bradford City Council to manage and operate the local education authority, providing education support services to the city&#x27;s schools. According to senior council officials, this period was marked with &quot;real problems&quot; and management was taken back in house by the local authority after the contract&#x27;s end-date. Serco has operated similar management arrangements for both Walsall and Stoke-on-Trent local education authorities. By 2009, Serco was one of Ofsted&#x27;s three Regional Inspection Service Providers, being responsible for school inspections in the English Midlands.

(the North American division of Serco Group) was awarded a US$1.25billion contract from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide Eligibility Support Services (i.e., the “CMS-ESS” contract), in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

In 2022, Serco was selected by the United States&#x27;s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop the first generation No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS).

=== New Zealand ===
During February 2011, Serco started operating the Mount Eden remand prison in Auckland, New Zealand. The firm was heavily criticized for the existence of &#x27;fight clubs&#x27; within Mount Eden prison that were not investigated until after their existence became public knowledge in July 2015 when footage emerged online and was reported by TVNZ. On 24 July 2015, Serco&#x27;s contract to run Mount Eden prison was revoked; its operation was given back to the New Zealand Department of Corrections. Serco was ordered to pay NZ$8million to the New Zealand government as a result of problems at Mount Eden Prison while it was under Serco&#x27;s management. The New Zealand government did not accept that this was a failure of governmental contracting and oversight; it brought in correctional officers from afar to provide adequate staffing at Mount Eden, and had spent NZ$2million by December 2016 housing up to 40 of them in Auckland hotels.

In March 2012, Serco was awarded a contract to build and operate a 960-bed prison at Wiri. During March 2022, Te Ao Māori News reported that prisoners at Auckland South Corrections Facility in Wiri were experiencing unliveable conditions, including the denial of prison visits, unjustified lockdowns, lack of access to medical care, and insufficient safeguards against COVID-19; Te Ao reported that these conditions had led to two suicides within the space of five months. In response, Serco disputed several incidents in Te Ao&#x27;s report and defended the quality of its care and services provided to prisoners. That same month, Radio New Zealand reported that Serco was using interns to produce psychological reports on Wiri prisoners for the Parole Board.

Starting in July 2009, Serco has held the national contract for various immigration detention centres, including Christmas Island and the Villawood detention centre in Sydney. The Union of Christmas Island Workers highlighted the systemic failure by Serco to manage the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre, where a large number of refugees, including 1,000 children, were detained at its peak around 2013. Under Serco, there was an increase of deaths in custody and self-harm in the years leading up to 2013, as well as a deterioration of facilities, leading to the decline of the physical and the mental health of detainees and of staff. Ombudsman Allan Asher stated &quot;In the first week of June when I visited Christmas Island, more than 30 incidents of self-harm by detainees held there were reported&quot;. Serco, in a staged memo leaked to &quot;The Australian&quot;, blamed the detainees for &quot;creating a culture of self-harm&quot; as a &quot;bargaining tool&quot;. The former manager of the detention centre stated the centre was grossly understaffed.

<doc id="216659" wikidata="Q7235121" url="?curid=216659" title="Potowomut, Rhode Island">
<text>Potowomut () is an isolated neighborhood and a peninsula in Warwick, Rhode Island. It is bordered by the Town of East Greenwich to the northwest, and by North Kingstown to the southeast. Greenwich Bay surrounds all other sides.

Potowomut&#x27;s name translates to &quot;land of fires&quot;, the Narragansett Indian name for the neck of land.

== History ==

It was originally a village in the Warwick Township of Kent County. It can be called an exclave, since there is no overland connection to the rest of the city of Warwick. Potowomut is often mistakenly thought to be part of the Town of East Greenwich because it shares the same ZIP code, &quot;02818&quot;, as all of East Greenwich and because East Greenwich is the preferred place name for postal purposes. Nathanael Greene, a general in the American Revolutionary War was born here on Forge Farm in 1742. When Warwick was settled, in the seventeenth century, travel by sea was often more convenient than travel over land. Thus, Potowomut&#x27;s location would have allowed relatively easy travel across Greenwich Bay to Warwick Neck or Buttonwoods.

In the 1680s, the first white settlers arrived with James Greene at what came to be known as Greene&#x27;s River. Here, his son, James, built a dam and a mill, later; his descendants established an anchor forge, now located at the foot of Old Forge Road. The Greene family mainly used the land to raise cattle and harvest hay, which was then shipped across Greenwich Bay to the wharf in Apponaug, Rhode Island. Upon James&#x27; death, the property passed to his son Richard. A fondness for lavish hospitality and fancy living plunged Richard Greene into deep debt.

== Geography ==

To visit Potowomut by land, one must leave the City of Warwick. The most common route follows US Route 1 (Post Rd.), and leaving East Greenwich, follows Forge Road to the east.

== Emergency services ==

Potowomut&#x27;s Fire Fighting services were for a long time provided by the town of East Greenwich for a yearly fee. In December 2015, the City of Warwick opened a new fire station and the Warwick Fire Department assumed responsibility for providing Fire and EMS protection to the area. WFD Fire Station 10 houses Engine Co. 10. The station is affectionately known as &quot;The Outpost&quot; due to its seclusion from the rest of the Dept. Police Services are provided by the Warwick Police Department.

== Features and attractions ==
Today, Potowomut is a reminder of Warwick&#x27;s past. The peninsula&#x27;s eastern tip gives a view of Greenwich Bay. The narrow streets have a mix of older and newer houses. Some were originally beach houses, closed in the winter months, now converted to full-time residences.

Unique to Potowomut is Goddard Memorial State Park. Goddard Park attracts thousands of visitors each year as Rhode Island&#x27;s most popular metropolitan park. Its facilities include a 9-hole golf course designed by Donald Ross, a horse barn where the public can rent and ride horses, a beach with bathhouse, sprawling open fields, and a carousel building for functions. Located next to the park is Potowomut Golf Club, a private club.

Potowomut is a peninsula on Narragansett Bay which can only be accessed via East Greenwich and/or the town of North Kingstown, only East Greenwich has municipal sewer lines (North Kingstown is in the process of putting them in along Post Road and part of Camp Avenue only). Potowomut cannot be accessed regarding a municipal sewer line due to geography. The city has attempted numerous times to reach a viable agreement with both towns which would enable it to access either of both municipal sewer lines, upon a viable agreement. Potowomut, located on the Narragansett Bay, consists of multiple residential neighborhoods resulting in a catalyst of sewage over-spill into Narragansett Bay. There is no solution at this time.

<text>In economics, the cross (or cross-price) elasticity of demand (XED) measures the effect of changes in the price of one good on the quantity demanded of another good. This reflects the fact that the quantity demanded of good is dependent on not only its own price (price elasticity of demand) but also the price of other &quot;related&quot; good. 

The cross elasticity of demand is calculated as the ratio between the percentage change of the quantity demanded for a good and the percentage change in the price of another good, ceteris paribus:formula_1The sign of the cross elasticity indicates the relationship between two goods. A negative cross elasticity denotes two products that are complements, while a positive cross elasticity denotes two products are substitutes. 
If products A and B are complements, an increase in the price of B leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded for A, as A is used in conjunction with B. Equivalently, if the price of product B decreases, the demand curve for product A shifts to the right reflecting an increase in A&#x27;s demand, resulting in a &quot;negative&quot; value for the cross elasticity of demand. If A and B are substitutes, an increase in the price of B will increase the market demand for A, as customers would easily replace B with A, like McDonald&#x27;s and Domino&#x27;s Pizza.

== History ==

The concept of &quot;price elasticity of demand&quot; originated by Alfred Marshall predicted relative changes between price and quantity. In the Cellophane case, Professor Stocking believed that a change in the price of one product will induce a price change of its &quot;rivalry&quot; in the same direction, so he firstly regarded that movement of two prices in the same direction explicitly reflects a high cross-price elasticity. However, during 1924–1940, du Pont cellophane prices moved independently from its perceived competitors&#x27; (waxed paper, vegetable parchment, etc) price; independent price movements reflect noncompetitive pricing between cellophane and its rival products. Thus, Professor Stocking&#x27;s emphasis on the same movement of prices was too rigid, as the price of cellophane changed induced by three factors:
#Change in demand due to price change of rival products
#The production function of the cellophane
#The slope and position of the cost curves of rival products.
In other words, the competitive relationship between two goods (cross-price elasticity) can not be simply concluded by price change, as price change arises from both cost and demand factors. Furthermore, instead of a high positive or low positive elasticity concluded by observing respective price change, cross-elasticity of demand should be either positive or negative to represent if there is a complementary or substitutive relationship between two goods.

== Calculation and interpretation ==
Cross elasticity of demand of product B with respect to product A (&quot;η&quot;BA):

: formula_2

formula_3 implies two goods are substitutes. Consumers purchase more B when the price of A increases. Example: the cross elasticity of demand of butter with respect to margarine is 0.81, so 1% increase in the price of margarine will increase the demand for butter by 0.81%.

formula_4 implies two goods are complements. Consumers purchase less B when the price of A increases. Example: the cross elasticity of demand of entertainment with respect to food is −0.72, so 1% increase in the price of food will decrease the demand for entertainment by 0.72%.

formula_5 implies two goods are independent (a price change of good A is unrelated to demand change of good B), so changes in the price of product A have no effect on the demand for Product B. Example: bread and cloths .
=== Degree of response ===
The higher the positive cross elasticity of demand, the more substitutable two products are; thus, the more competition between them. Similarly, the lower the negative cross elasticity of demand, the more complementary two goods are. In general, monopolies usually possess a low-positive cross elasticity of demand with respect to their competitors.

==== Elastic demand ====
If the absolute value of the cross elasticity of demand is greater than 1, the cross elasticity of demand is elastic, this means that a change in price of good A results in a more than proportionate change in quantity demanded for good B. In other words, a change in price of good A has a &quot;relatively&quot; high impact on the change in quantity demanded for good B.
formula_6
==== Inelastic demand ====
If the absolute value of the cross elasticity of demand between 1 and 0, the cross elasticity of demand is inelastic, this means that a change in price of good A results in a less than proportionate change in quantity demanded for good B. In other words, a change in price of good A has a &quot;relatively&quot; small impact on the change in quantity demanded for good B.
formula_7

==== Unitary demand ====
If the value of the cross elasticity of demand is 1, the cross elasticity of demand is unitary, this means that a change in price of good A results in an exactly proportionate change in quantity demanded for good B.
formula_8

==Results for main types of goods==
For two goods, fuel and new cars (consists of fuel consumption), are &quot;complements&quot;; that is, one is used with the other. In these cases the cross elasticity of demand will be &quot;negative&quot;, as shown by the decrease in demand for cars when the price for fuel will rise. In the case of perfect substitutes, the cross elasticity of demand is equal to positive infinity (at the point when both goods can be consumed). Where the two goods are &quot;independent&quot;, or, as described in consumer theory, if a good is independent in demand then the demand of that good is independent of the quantity consumed of all other goods available to the consumer, the cross elasticity of demand will be &quot;zero&quot; i.e. if the price of one good changes, there will be no change in demand for the other good.

When goods are substitutable, the diversion ratio, which quantifies how much of the displaced demand for product &quot;j&quot; switches to product &quot;i&quot;, is measured by the ratio of the cross-elasticity to the own-elasticity multiplied by the ratio of product &quot;i&quot;″s demand to product &quot;j&quot;″s demand. In the discrete case, the diversion ratio is naturally interpreted as the fraction of product &quot;j&quot; demand which treats product &quot;i&quot; as a second choice, measuring how much of the demand diverting from product &quot;j&quot; because of a price increase is diverted to product &quot;i&quot; can be written as the product of the ratio of the cross-elasticity to the own-elasticity and the ratio of the demand for product &quot;i&quot; to the demand for product &quot;j&quot;. In some cases, it has a natural interpretation as the proportion of people buying product &quot;j&quot; who would consider product &quot;i&quot; their &quot;second choice&quot;.

Approximate estimates of the cross price elasticities of preference-independent bundles of goods (e.g. food and education, healthcare and clothing, etc.) can be calculated from the income elasticities of demand and market shares of individual bundles, using established models of demand based on a differential approach.

===Selected cross price elasticities of demand===
Below are some examples of the cross-price elasticity of demand (XED) for various goods:
== Application and Implication ==
An enterprise needs to understand the cross-elastic demand for a product or service. Cross-elastic demand can help enterprises set prices and identify the sensitivity of others to their products. For example, a strategic &quot;loss leader&quot; takes advantage of the negative cross elasticity of demand for complementary commodities to price in a counterintuitive way deliberately. A company can sell one of its goods for less than the cost of making it and thus promote sales of its complementary products. Large profits on complementary products can make up for net losses in the business of its main products. Many large companies use this strategy, such as Sony. Sony&#x27;s PlayStation consoles are sold below the cost of making them encourage the sale of games. Games and consoles are almost perfectly complementary. The reduction in the price of consoles will significantly increase the demand for games. As a result, Sony can make up for its net losses in the console business by making big profits in games 

Besides, unique and irreplaceable products enable companies to sell their products at higher prices. Because of the uniqueness of the product, companies do not worry too much about consumers switching to other products. However, the specific price setting should also follow the demand curve of the commodity. Suppose the elasticity of demand for the product is greater than 1. In that case, it means that a slight change in the product&#x27;s price will cause a significant reduction in the consumer demand for the product. Therefore, companies should first make a careful study of the elasticity of demand for their products before setting prices. It ensures a broader profit range for the company. A real-life example is Apple. Apple used iOS, which is different from Android, at the beginning of the launch of their phones. The clean and straightforward interface is an irreplaceable advantage of this system. Apple, meanwhile, has its unique text-message tone and call ringtone. In many small ways, Apple is building uniqueness. Phone users who are used to iOS develop a habit that makes it difficult to adapt to other systems, such as Android.

Finally, the providers of substitutes need to be aware of the competitors of their products through detailed market research. The company can reduce the sensitivity of competitors&#x27; products by increasing customer loyalty. For example, the recently hot quality stars are invited to endorse their company&#x27;s products. It can attract some of the star&#x27;s loyalists to the product, thus increasing the overall loyalty. Alternatively, the company could spend more money on advertising to make consumers aware of the difference between its product and that of its competitors.

=== Contribution to policy improvement===
The UK and Scottish governments intended to use price-based policy interventions, like setting minimum unit pricing and increasing taxation to reduce alcohol consumption and mediate the related harms among their population. Estimation of cross-price elasticities of alcohol in respect to other related beverages helps set price-based policy interventions, as it measures the percentage change in demand for one type of alcohol due to a 1% change in the price of another type of beverage. For example, the cross elasticity of demand for wine in respect to the price change of spirit is 0.05, which implies that a 1% price decrease for Spirit will reduce market demand for wine by 0.05%. Therefore, the cross elasticity of demand enables policymakers to take better control of the policy effects, thus, reducing the risk for mortality, morbidity, and other social harms caused by over-drinking.

===Contribution to the sustainable supply chain===
A high coefficient of negative cross-price elasticity implies that the sales of product A are decided by the sales of product B. If the demand of A significantly depends on the demand of B, there must be a reduction in the profit of A. In this case, the cross elasticity of demand is a reminder to the firms to cautiously selecting products with high dependence on complements. On the other hand, the high-positive cross elasticity of demand reflects high substitutability of goods, which means customers&#x27; demand can be fulfilled by other products easily. Businesses that understand the implications of high-positive cross elasticity of demand can reduce their operating risk by avoiding overstock, thus, maintaining a sustainable supply chain.

===Contribution to firm reactions===
Knowledge of a firm&#x27;s cross elasticity of demand and their competitors&#x27; allows them to map out the market, enabling them to calculate the number of rivals and the importance of their complementary (and substitute) products relative to their own. Firms can develop strategies to reduce their exposure to the risks they are imposed to by price changes of other firms, such as an increase in the price of a complement or a decrease in the price of a substitute.

=== Potential strategies ===

==== Horizontal integration ====
In markets with few competitors, cross elasticity between rivals are likely to be high, this makes firms in the market vulnerable to price competition. Horizontal integration, usually mergers, could reduce said risks by reducing competition in the market. For example, when Anheuser-Busch InBev (the world&#x27;s biggest brewer at the time) acquired SABMiller (InBev&#x27;s closest rival) in 2015, it was one of the biggest takeover of a British firm, creating the world&#x27;s first global brewer. The takeover created a brewing empire that produces a third of the world&#x27;s beer.

==== Vertical integration ====
Firms may gain better control of the market by merging with suppliers of complementary products. Developing their own complementary products is another possible solution. For example, Google developing Google Pixel is an attempt by Google to capture the smartphone market share by integrating both its software and hardware features for improved performance while being more resource efficient.
==== Alliances and collusion ====
Competitors may pool resources to create a joint alliance, such as Sony-Ericsson in October of 2001. Sony had a share of less than 1% in the mobile phone market; while Ericsson was the third largest market share holder. Unfortunately, Ericsson relied heavily on a single supplier, and when a fire broke out at a Phillips factory, Ericsson couldn&#x27;t fulfill their orders. Sony wanted a greater market share and Ericsson wanted to avoid going out of business, hence the Sony-Ericsson joint venture was formed.

Firms entering into a price fixing agreement in order to avoid price wars means they are involved in a collusion. The chances of collusion to occur is higher in markets with few competitors such as oligopolistic markets. It is illegal according to antitrust laws, even though collusive agreements may be implicit, its implication with cartels are the same.

<doc id="216661" wikidata="Q154367" url="?curid=216661" title="Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock">
<text>Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (; 2 July 1724 – 14 March 1803) was a German poet. His best known works are the epic poem &quot;Der Messias&quot; (&quot;The Messiah&quot;) and the poem &quot;Die Auferstehung&quot; (&quot;The Resurrection&quot;), with the latter set to text in the finale of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2. One of his major contributions to German literature was to open it up to exploration outside of French models.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Klopstock was born at Quedlinburg, the eldest son of a lawyer. Both in his birthplace and on the estate of Friedeburg on the Saale, which his father later rented, he spent a happy childhood. Having been given more attention to his physical than to his mental development, he grew up strong and healthy and was considered an excellent horseman. In his thirteenth year, he returned to Quedlinburg and attended the gymnasium there, and in 1739 went on to the famous classical school named Schulpforta. Here he soon became adept in Greek and Latin versification, and wrote some meritorious idylls and odes in German. His original intention of making Henry the Fowler the hero of an epic was abandoned in favor of a religious epic, under the influence of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; with which he became acquainted through Bodmer&#x27;s translation.

While still at school, he had already drafted the plan of &quot;Der Messias&quot; on which most of his fame rests. On 21 September 1745 he delivered, on quitting school, a remarkable &quot;departing oration&quot; on epic poetry—&quot;Abschiedsrede über die epische Poesie, kultur- und literargeschichtlich erläutert&quot;—and next proceeded to Jena as a student of theology, where he drew up in prose the first three cantos of the &quot;Messias&quot;. Finding life at that university not to his liking, he transferred in the spring of 1746 to Leipzig, where he joined a circle of young men of letters who contributed to the &quot;Bremer Beiträge&quot;. In this periodical the first three cantos of &quot;Der Messias&quot; were published anonymously in hexameter verse in 1748.

===Denmark and Germany===
A new era in German literature had commenced, and the identity of the author soon became known. In Leipzig he also wrote a number of odes, the best known of which is &quot;An meine Freunde&quot; (1747), afterwards recast as &quot;Wingolf&quot; (1767). He left the university in 1748 and became a private tutor in the family of a relative at Langensalza, where unrequited love for a cousin (the &quot;Fanny&quot; of his odes) disturbed his peace of mind. For that reason he gladly accepted in 1750 an invitation from Bodmer, the translator of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, to visit him in Zürich, where Klopstock was initially treated with every kindness and respect and rapidly recovered his spirits. Bodmer, however, was disappointed to find in the young poet of the &quot;Messias&quot; a man of strong worldly interests, and a coolness sprang up between the two men.

At this juncture Klopstock received from Frederick V of Denmark, on the recommendation of his minister Count von Bernstorff (1712–1772), an invitation to settle in Copenhagen with an annuity of 400 thalers, in the hope that he would complete &quot;Der Messias&quot; there. The offer was accepted.

On his way to the Danish capital, Klopstock met in Hamburg the woman who later in 1754 became his wife, Margareta or Meta Moller, the &quot;Cidli&quot; of his odes. She was the daughter of a Hamburg merchant and an enthusiastic admirer of his poetry. His happiness was short, as she died in childbirth in 1758, leaving him broken-hearted. His grief at her loss finds pathetic expression in the fifteenth canto of the &quot;Messias&quot;.
The poet subsequently published his wife&#x27;s writings, &quot;Hinterlassene Werke von Margareta Klopstock&quot; (1759), which give evidence of a tender, sensitive and deeply religious spirit. See also &quot;Memoirs of Frederick and Margaret Klopstock&quot; (English translation by Elizabeth Smith, London, 1808) and her correspondence with Samuel Richardson, published 1818.

===Depression and &quot;Messias&quot;===
Klopstock now relapsed into melancholy; new ideas failed him, and his poetry became more introspective. He continued to live and work in Copenhagen, however, and next, following Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg, turned his attention to northern mythology, which in his view should replace classical subjects in a new school of German poetry. In 1770, when King Christian VII dismissed Count Bernstorff from office, he retired with the latter to Hamburg but retained his pension, together with the rank of councillor of legation.

In 1773 were published the last five cantos of the &quot;Messias&quot;. In the following year he published a scheme for the regeneration of German letters, &quot;Die Gelehrtenrepublik&quot; (1774). In 1775 he traveled south, and making the acquaintance of Goethe on the way, spent a year at the court of the Margrave of Baden at Karlsruhe. Thence, in 1776, with the title of &quot;Hofrath&quot; and a pension from the Margrave, which he retained along with that from the king of Denmark, he returned to Hamburg where he spent the remainder of his life.

===Last years===
His latter years he passed, as had always been his inclination, in retirement, only occasionally relieved by socializing with his most intimate friends, occupied in philological studies and taking scant interest in the new developments in German literature. However, he was enthusiastic about the American War of Independence and the French Revolution. The French Republic sent him a diploma of honorary citizenship; but, horrified at the terrible scenes the Revolution had enacted in the name of liberty, he returned it.

At the age of 67 he undertook a second marriage, to Johanna Elisabeth von Winthem, a widow and a niece of his late wife, who for many years had been one of his most intimate friends. He died in Hamburg on 14 March 1803, mourned throughout Germany, and was buried with great ceremony next to his first wife in the churchyard of the village of Ottensen.

==Works==
===&quot;Der Messias&quot;===
The &quot;Messias&quot; follows from the aspirations to become an epic poet, which Klopstock nurtured in his early years. The leitmotif of the work is the Redemption, which is given an epic treatment. He resorted to Christian mythology in trying to circumscribe the subject-matter within the dogmas of the Church.

Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was one of the models Klopstock had in mind in giving form to his poem. The poem took twenty-five years to complete. The work aroused intense public enthusiasm at its commencement. It has been translated into seventeen languages, and led to numerous imitations.

===Odes and dramas===
In his odes Klopstock had more scope for his distinctive talent. Some have Nordic mythological inspiration, while others emphasize religious themes.
Among the most celebrated and translated are &quot;An Fanny&quot;; &quot;Der Zürchersee&quot;; &quot;Die tote Klarissa&quot;; &quot;An Cidli&quot;; &quot;Die beiden Musen&quot;; &quot;Der Rheinwein&quot;; &quot;Die frühen Gräber&quot;, &quot;Mein Vaterland&quot;. His religious odes mostly take the form of hymns, of which the most beautiful is &quot;Die Frühlingsfeier&quot;.

In some of his dramas, notably &quot;Hermanns Schlacht&quot; (1769) and &quot;Hermann und die Fürsten&quot; (1784), Klopstock celebrated the deeds of the ancient German hero Arminius, and in others, &quot;Der Tod Adams&quot; (1757) and &quot;Salomo&quot; (1764), he took his materials from the Old Testament. These also represent an important part of his body of work. Composer Sigrid Henriette Wienecke used Klopstock&#x27;s writings as the text for her musical drama Fader Vor. He immortalized his 1750s visit at the Swiss Au peninsula in his &quot;Ode an den Zürichsee&quot; (&quot;Ode to Lake Zurich&quot;).

It has been said that Klopstock&#x27;s hymn &quot;Die Auferstehung&quot; at the funeral of Hans von Bülow in 1894 gave Gustav Mahler the inspiration for the final movement of his Second Symphony. Mahler incorporated the hymn with extra verses he wrote himself to bring a personal resolution to this work.

Klopstock published odes and hymns, including Der am Kreuz ist meine Liebe, which is in shortened and revised form part of the 2013 Catholic hymnal &quot;Gotteslob&quot;.

===Prose===
In addition to &quot;Die Gelehrtenrepublik&quot;, he was also the author of &quot;Fragmente über Sprache und Dichtkunst&quot; (1779) and &quot;Grammatische Gespräche&quot; (1794), works in which he made important contributions to philology and to the history of German poetry.

===Correspondence===
As was common in the period, Klopstock kept up an abundant correspondence with his contemporaries, friends, and colleagues, and this has been published in diverse collections. Some of them are listed below:
*K. Schmidt, &quot;Klopstock und seine Freunde&quot; (1810); this is the basis for &quot;Klopstock and his friends. A series of familiar letters, written between the years 1750 and 1803&quot;, translated and introduced by Elizabeth Benger (London, 1814)
*, &quot;Klopstocks Nachlass&quot; (1821)
*J. M. Lappenberg, &quot;Briefe von und an Klopstock&quot; (1867).

===Editions===
Klopstock&#x27;s &quot;Werke&quot; first appeared in seven quarto volumes (1798–1809). At the same time a more complete edition in twelve octavo volumes was published (1798–1817), to which six additional volumes were added in 1830. Other nineteenth-century editions were published in 1844–1845, 1854–1855, 1879 (ed. by R. Boxberger), 1884 (ed. by R. Hamel) and 1893 (a selection edited by F. Muncker). A critical edition of the &quot;Odes&quot; was published by F. Muncker and J. Pawel in 1889; a commentary on these by H. Düntzer (1860; 2nd ed., 1878).

==Goethe&#x27;s description==
Goethe in his autobiography recorded his personal impression of Klopstock: &quot;He was of small stature, but well built. His manners were grave and decorous, but free from pedantry. His address was intelligent and pleasing. On the whole, one might have taken him for a diplomatist. He carried himself with the self-conscious dignity of a person who has a great moral mission to fulfil. He conversed with facility on various subjects, but rather avoided speaking of poetry and literary matters.&quot;

==Legacy==
Klopstock&#x27;s enrichment of poetic vocabulary and attention to prosody did great service to the poets who immediately followed him. In freeing German poetry from its exclusive interest in Alexandrine verse, he became the founder of a new era in German literature, so that Schiller and Goethe were artistically indebted to him. An 800 year old oak tree where Klopstock spent time in Denmark was named after him.

<text>Colley Cibber (6 November 1671 – 11 December 1757) was an English actor-manager, playwright and Poet Laureate. His colourful memoir &quot;An Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber&quot; (1740) describes his life in a personal, anecdotal and even rambling style. He wrote 25 plays for his own company at Drury Lane, half of which were adapted from various sources, which led Robert Lowe and Alexander Pope, among others, to criticise his &quot;miserable mutilation&quot; of &quot;crucified Molière [and] hapless Shakespeare&quot;. 

He regarded himself as first and foremost an actor and had great popular success in comical fop parts, while as a tragic actor he was persistent but much ridiculed. Cibber&#x27;s brash, extroverted personality did not sit well with his contemporaries, and he was frequently accused of tasteless theatrical productions, shady business methods, and a social and political opportunism that was thought to have gained him the laureateship over far better poets. He rose to ignominious fame when he became the chief target, the head Dunce, of Alexander Pope&#x27;s satirical poem &quot;The Dunciad&quot;.

Cibber&#x27;s poetical work was derided in his time and has been remembered only for being poor. His importance in British theatre history rests on his being one of the first in a long line of actor-managers, on the interest of two of his comedies as documents of evolving early 18th-century taste and ideology, and on the value of his autobiography as a historical source.

==Life==
Cibber was born in Southampton Street, in Bloomsbury, London. He was the eldest child of Caius Gabriel Cibber, a distinguished sculptor originally from Denmark. His mother, Jane née Colley, came from a family of gentry from Glaston, Rutland. He was educated at the King&#x27;s School, Grantham, from 1682 until the age of 16, but failed to win a place at Winchester College, which had been founded by his maternal ancestor William of Wykeham. In 1688, he joined the service of his father&#x27;s patron, Lord Devonshire, who was one of the prime supporters of the Glorious Revolution. After the revolution, and at a loose end in London, he was attracted to the stage and in 1690 began work as an actor in Thomas Betterton&#x27;s United Company at the Drury Lane Theatre. &quot;Poor, at odds with his parents, and entering the theatrical world at a time when players were losing their power to businessmen-managers&quot;, on 6 May 1693 Cibber married Katherine Shore, the daughter of Matthias Shore, sergeant-trumpeter to the King, despite his poor prospects and insecure, socially inferior job.

Cibber and Katherine had 12 children between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, and most of the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife&#x27;s death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray&#x27;s Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett&#x27;s death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717, before reaching adulthood. Colley&#x27;s youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father&#x27;s theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.

After an inauspicious start as an actor, Cibber eventually became a popular comedian, wrote and adapted many plays, and rose to become one of the newly empowered businessmen-managers. He took over the management of Drury Lane in 1710 and took a highly commercial, if not artistically successful, line in the job. In 1730, he was made Poet Laureate, an appointment which attracted widespread scorn, particularly from Alexander Pope and other Tory satirists. Off-stage, he was a keen gambler, and was one of the investors in the South Sea Company.

In the last two decades of his life, Cibber remained prominent in society, and summered in Georgian spas such as Tunbridge, Scarborough and Bath. He was friendly with the writer Samuel Richardson, the actress Margaret Woffington and the memoirist–poet Laetitia Pilkington. Aged 73 in 1745, he made his last appearance on the stage as Pandulph in his own &quot;deservedly unsuccessful&quot; &quot;Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John&quot;. In 1750, he fell seriously ill and recommended his friend and protégé Henry Jones as the next Poet Laureate. Cibber recovered and Jones passed into obscurity. Cibber died suddenly at his house in Berkeley Square, London, in December 1757, leaving small pecuniary legacies to four of his five surviving children, £1,000 each (the equivalent of approximately £180,000 in 2011) to his granddaughters Jane and Elizabeth (the daughters of Theophilus), and the residue of his estate to his eldest daughter Catherine. He was buried on 18 December, probably at the Grosvenor Chapel on South Audley Street.

==Autobiography==

Cibber&#x27;s colourful autobiography &quot;An Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber, Comedian&quot; (1740) was chatty, meandering, anecdotal, vain, and occasionally inaccurate. At the time of writing the word &quot;apology&quot; meant an &quot;apologia&quot;, a statement in defence of one&#x27;s actions rather than an expression of regret at having transgressed.

The text virtually ignores his wife and family, but Cibber wrote in detail about his time in the theatre, especially his early years as a young actor at Drury Lane in the 1690s, giving a vivid account of the cut-throat theatre company rivalries and chicanery of the time, as well as providing pen portraits of the actors he knew. The &quot;Apology&quot; is vain and self-serving, as both his contemporaries and later commentators have pointed out, but it also serves as Cibber&#x27;s rebuttal to his harshest critics, especially Pope. For the early part of Cibber&#x27;s career, it is unreliable in respect of chronology and other hard facts, understandably, since it was written 50 years after the events, apparently without the help of a journal or notes. Nevertheless, it is an invaluable source for all aspects of the early 18th-century theatre in London, for which documentation is otherwise scanty. Because he worked with many actors from the early days of Restoration theatre, such as Thomas Betterton and Elizabeth Barry at the end of their careers, and lived to see David Garrick perform, he is a bridge between the earlier mannered and later more naturalistic styles of performance.

The &quot;Apology&quot; was a popular work and gave Cibber a good return. Its complacency infuriated some of his contemporaries, notably Pope, but even the usually critical Samuel Johnson admitted it was &quot;very entertaining and very well done&quot;. It went through four editions in his lifetime, and more after his death, and generations of readers have found it an amusing and engaging read, projecting an author always &quot;happy in his own good opinion, the best of all others; teeming with animal spirits, and uniting the self-sufficiency of youth with the garrulity of age.&quot;

==Actor==
Cibber began his career as an actor at Drury Lane in 1690, and had little success for several years. &quot;The first Thing that enters into the Head of a young Actor&quot;, he wrote in his autobiography half a century later, &quot;is that of being a Hero: In this Ambition I was soon snubb&#x27;d by the Insufficiency of my Voice; to which might be added an uninform&#x27;d meagre Person ... with a dismal pale Complexion. Under these Disadvantages, I had but a melancholy Prospect of ever playing a Lover with Mrs. Bracegirdle, which I had flatter&#x27;d my Hopes that my Youth might one Day have recommended me to.&quot;
At this time the London stage was in something of a slump after the glories of the early Restoration period. The King&#x27;s and Duke&#x27;s companies had merged into a monopoly, leaving actors in a weak negotiating position and much at the mercy of the dictatorial manager Christopher Rich. When the senior actors rebelled and established a cooperative company of their own in 1695, Cibber—&quot;wisely&quot;, as the &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Actors&quot; puts it—stayed with the remnants of the old company, &quot;where the competition was less keen&quot;. After five years, he had still not seen significant success in his chosen profession, and there had been no heroic parts and no love scenes. However, the return of two-company rivalry created a sudden demand for new plays, and Cibber seized this opportunity to launch his career by writing a comedy with a big, flamboyant part for himself to play. He scored a double triumph: his comedy &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift, or The Fool in Fashion&quot; (1696) was a great success, and his own uninhibited performance as the Frenchified fop Sir Novelty Fashion (&quot;a coxcomb that loves to be the first in all foppery&quot;) delighted the audiences. His name was made, both as playwright and as comedian.

Later in life, when Cibber himself had the last word in casting at Drury Lane, he wrote, or patched together, several tragedies that were tailored to fit his continuing hankering after playing &quot;a Hero&quot;. However, his performances of such parts never pleased audiences, which wanted to see him typecast as an affected fop, a kind of character that fitted both his private reputation as a vain man, his exaggerated, mannered style of acting, and his habit of ad libbing. His most famous part for the rest of his career remained that of Lord Foppington in &quot;The Relapse&quot;, a sequel to Cibber&#x27;s own &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; but written by John Vanbrugh, first performed in 1696 with Cibber reprising his performance as Sir Novelty Fashion in the newly ennobled guise of Lord Foppington. Pope mentions the audience jubilation that greeted the small-framed Cibber donning Lord Foppington&#x27;s enormous wig, which would be ceremoniously carried on stage in its own sedan chair. Vanbrugh reputedly wrote the part of Lord Foppington deliberately &quot;to suit the eccentricities of Cibber&#x27;s acting style&quot;.

His tragic efforts, however, were consistently ridiculed by contemporaries: when Cibber in the role of Richard III made love to Lady Anne, the &quot;Grub Street Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;he looks like a pickpocket, with his shrugs and grimaces, that has more a design on her purse than her heart&quot;. Cibber was on the stage in every year but two (1727 and 1731) between his debut in 1690 and his retirement in 1732, playing more than 100 parts in all in nearly 3,000 documented performances. After he had sold his interest in Drury Lane in 1733 and was a wealthy man in his sixties, he returned to the stage occasionally to play the classic fop parts of Restoration comedy for which audiences appreciated him. His Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh&#x27;s &quot;The Relapse&quot;, Sir Courtly Nice in John Crowne&#x27;s &quot;Sir Courtly Nice&quot;, and Sir Fopling Flutter in George Etherege&#x27;s &quot;Man of Mode&quot; were legendary. Critic John Hill in his 1775 work &quot;The actor, or, A treatise on the art of playing&quot;, described Cibber as &quot;the best Lord Foppington who ever appeared, was in real life (with all due respect be it spoken by one who loves him) something of the coxcomb&quot;. These were the kind of comic parts where Cibber&#x27;s affectation and mannerism were desirable. In 1738–39, he played Shallow in Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry IV, Part 2 to critical acclaim, but his Richard III (in his own version of the play) was not well received. In the middle of the play, he whispered to fellow actor Benjamin Victor that he wanted to go home, perhaps realising he was too old for the part and its physical demands. Cibber also essayed tragic parts in plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Dryden and others, but with less success. By the end of his acting career, audiences were being entranced by the innovatively naturalistic acting of the rising star David Garrick, who made his London debut in the title part in a production of Cibber&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Richard III&quot; in 1741. He returned to the stage for a final time in 1745 as Cardinal Pandulph in his play &quot;Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John&quot;.

==Playwright==

===&quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;===
Cibber&#x27;s comedy &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; (1696) is an early herald of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; illustrates Cibber&#x27;s opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.

The central action of &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; is a celebration of the power of a good woman, Amanda, to reform a rakish husband, Loveless, by means of sweet patience and a daring bed-trick. She masquerades as a prostitute and seduces Loveless without being recognised, and then confronts him with logical argument. Since he enjoyed the night with her while taking her for a stranger, a wife can be as good in bed as an illicit mistress. Loveless is convinced and stricken, and a rich choreography of mutual kneelings, risings and prostrations follows, generated by Loveless&#x27; penitence and Amanda&#x27;s &quot;submissive eloquence&quot;. The première audience is said to have wept at this climactic scene. The play was a great box-office success and was for a time the talk of the town, in both a positive and a negative sense. Some contemporaries regarded it as moving and amusing, others as a sentimental tear-jerker, incongruously interspersed with sexually explicit Restoration comedy jokes and semi-nude bedroom scenes.

&quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; is today read mainly to gain a perspective on Vanbrugh&#x27;s sequel &quot;The Relapse&quot;, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; from the first, namely that it is a blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber&#x27;s follow-up comedy &quot;Woman&#x27;s Wit&quot; (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the &quot;Apology&quot;. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy &quot;Xerxes&quot; (1699). Cibber reused parts of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Wit&quot; for &quot;The School Boy&quot; (1702).

===&quot;Richard III&quot;===

Perhaps partly because of the failure of his previous two plays, Cibber&#x27;s next effort was an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. Neither Cibber&#x27;s adaptations nor his own original plays have stood the test of time, and hardly any of them have been staged or reprinted after the early 18th century, but his popular adaptation of &quot;Richard III&quot; remained the standard stage version for 150 years. The American actor George Berrell wrote in the 1870s that &quot;Richard III&quot; was:
&quot;Richard III&quot; was followed by another adaptation, the comedy &quot;Love Makes a Man&quot;, which was constructed by splicing together two plays by John Fletcher: &quot;The Elder Brother&quot; and &quot;The Custom of the Country&quot;. Cibber&#x27;s confidence was apparently restored by the success of the two plays, and he returned to more original writing.

===&quot;The Careless Husband&quot;===

The comedy &quot;The Careless Husband&quot; (1704), generally considered to be Cibber&#x27;s best play, is another example of the retrieval of a straying husband by means of outstanding wifely tact, this time in a more domestic and genteel register. The easy-going Sir Charles Easy is chronically unfaithful to his wife, seducing both ladies of quality and his own female servants with insouciant charm. The turning point of the action, known as &quot;the Steinkirk scene&quot;, comes when his wife finds him and a maidservant asleep together in a chair, &quot;as close an approximation to actual adultery as could be presented on the 18th-century stage&quot;. His periwig has fallen off, an obvious suggestion of intimacy and abandon, and an opening for Lady Easy&#x27;s tact. Soliloquizing to herself about how sad it would be if he caught cold, she &quot;takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and lays it gently on his Head&quot; (V.i.21). (A &quot;steinkirk&quot; was a loosely tied lace collar or scarf, named after the way the officers wore their cravats at the Battle of Steenkirk in 1692.) She steals away, Sir Charles wakes, notices the steinkirk on his head, marvels that his wife did not wake him and make a scene, and realises how wonderful she is. The Easys go on to have a reconciliation scene which is much more low-keyed and tasteful than that in &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;, without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy shrinking with feminine delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had broached without blinking. Paul Parnell has analysed the manipulative nature of Lady Easy&#x27;s lines in this exchange, showing how they are directed towards the sentimentalist&#x27;s goal of &quot;ecstatic self-approval&quot;.

&quot;The Careless Husband&quot; was a great success on the stage and remained in repertory throughout the 18th century. Although it has now joined &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; as a forgotten curiosity, it kept a respectable critical reputation into the 20th century, coming in for serious discussion both as an interesting example of doublethink, and as somewhat morally or emotionally insightful. In 1929, the well-known critic F. W. Bateson described the play&#x27;s psychology as &quot;mature&quot;, &quot;plausible&quot;, &quot;subtle&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, and &quot;affecting&quot;.

===Other plays===
&quot;The Lady&#x27;s Last Stake&quot; (1707) is a rather bad-tempered reply to critics of Lady Easy&#x27;s wifely patience in &quot;The Careless Husband&quot;. It was coldly received, and its main interest lies in the glimpse the prologue gives of angry reactions to &quot;The Careless Husband&quot;, of which we would otherwise have known nothing (since all contemporary published reviews of &quot;The Careless Husband&quot; approve and endorse its message). Some, says Cibber sarcastically in the prologue, seem to think Lady Easy ought rather to have strangled her husband with her steinkirk:
Many of Cibber&#x27;s plays, listed below, were hastily cobbled together from borrowings. Alexander Pope said Cibber&#x27;s drastic adaptations and patchwork plays were stolen from &quot;crucified Molière&quot; and &quot;hapless Shakespeare&quot;. &quot;The Double Gallant&quot; (1707) was constructed from Burnaby&#x27;s &quot;The Reformed Wife&quot; and &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Visiting Day&quot;, and Centlivre&#x27;s &quot;Love at a Venture&quot;. In the words of Leonard R. N. Ashley, Cibber took &quot;what he could use from these old failures&quot; to cook up &quot;a palatable hash out of unpromising leftovers&quot;. &quot;The Comical Lovers&quot; (1707) was based on Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Marriage à la Mode&quot;. &quot;The Rival Fools&quot; (1709) was based on Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Wit at Several Weapons&quot;. He rewrote Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Le Cid&quot; with a happy ending as &quot;Ximena&quot; in 1712. &quot;The Provoked Husband&quot; (1728) was an unfinished fragment by John Vanbrugh that Cibber reworked and completed to great commercial success.

&quot;The Non-Juror&quot; (1717) was adapted from Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot; and features a Papist spy as a villain. Written just two years after the Jacobite rising of 1715, it was an obvious propaganda piece directed against Roman Catholics. &quot;The Refusal&quot; (1721) was based on Molière&#x27;s &quot;Les Femmes Savantes&quot;. Cibber&#x27;s last play, &quot;Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John&quot; was &quot;a miserable mutilation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King John&quot;&quot;. Heavily politicised, it caused such a storm of ridicule during its 1736 rehearsal that Cibber withdrew it. During the Jacobite Rising of 1745, when the nation was again in fear of a Popish pretender, it was finally acted, and this time accepted for patriotic reasons.

==Manager==
Cibber&#x27;s career as both actor and theatre manager is important in the history of the British stage because he was one of the first in a long and illustrious line of actor-managers that would include Garrick, Henry Irving, and Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Rising from actor at Drury Lane to advisor to the manager Christopher Rich, Cibber worked himself by degrees into a position to take over the company, first taking many of its players—including Thomas Doggett, Robert Wilks, and Anne Oldfield—to form a new company at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre at the Haymarket. The three actors squeezed out the previous owners in a series of lengthy and complex manoeuvres, but after Rich&#x27;s letters patent were revoked, Cibber, Doggett and Wilks were able to buy the company outright and return to the Theatre Royal by 1711. After a few stormy years of power-struggle between the prudent Doggett and the extravagant Wilks, Doggett was replaced by the upcoming actor Barton Booth and Cibber became in practice sole manager of Drury Lane. He set a pattern for the line of more charismatic and successful actors that were to succeed him in this combination of roles. His near-contemporary Garrick, as well as the 19th-century actor-managers Irving and Tree, would later structure their careers, writing, and manager identity around their own striking stage personalities. Cibber&#x27;s &quot;forte&quot; as actor-manager was, by contrast, the manager side. He was a clever, innovative, and unscrupulous businessman who retained all his life a love of appearing on the stage. His triumph was that he rose to a position where, in consequence of his sole power over production and casting at Drury Lane, London audiences had to put up with him as an actor. Cibber&#x27;s one significant mistake as a theatre manager was to pass over John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, which became an outstanding success for John Rich&#x27;s theatre at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. When Cibber attempted to mimic Gay&#x27;s success with his own ballad-opera—&quot;Love in a Riddle&quot; (1729)—it was shouted down by the audience and Cibber cancelled its run. He rescued its comic subplot as &quot;Damon and Phillida&quot;.

Cibber had learned from the bad example of Christopher Rich to be a careful and approachable employer for his actors, and was not unpopular with them; however, he made enemies in the literary world because of the power he wielded over authors. Plays he considered non-commercial were rejected or ruthlessly reworked. Many were outraged by his sharp business methods, which may be exemplified by the characteristic way he abdicated as manager in the mid-1730s. In 1732, Booth sold his share to John Highmore, and Wilks&#x27; share fell into the hands of John Ellys after Wilks&#x27; death. Cibber leased his share in the company to his scapegrace son Theophilus for 442 pounds, but when Theophilus fell out with the other managers, they approached Cibber senior and offered to buy out his share. Without consulting Theophilus, Cibber sold his share for more than 3,000 pounds to the other managers, who promptly gave Theophilus his notice. According to one story, Cibber encouraged his son to lead the actors in a walkout and set up for themselves in the Haymarket, rendering worthless the commodity he had sold. On behalf of his son, Cibber applied for a letters patent to perform at the Haymarket, but it was refused by the Lord Chamberlain, who was &quot;disgusted at Cibber&#x27;s conduct&quot;. The Drury Lane managers attempted to shut down the rival Haymarket players by conspiring in the arrest of the lead actor, John Harper, on a charge of vagrancy, but the charge did not hold, and the attempt pushed public opinion to Theophilus&#x27; side. The Drury Lane managers were defeated, and Theophilus regained control of the company on his own terms.

==Poet==
Cibber&#x27;s appointment as Poet Laureate in December 1730 was widely assumed to be a political rather than artistic honour, and a reward for his untiring support of the Whigs, the party of Prime Minister Robert Walpole. Most of the leading writers, such as Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope, were excluded from contention for the laureateship because they were Tories. Cibber&#x27;s verses had few admirers even in his own time, and Cibber acknowledged cheerfully that he did not think much of them. His 30 birthday odes for the royal family and other duty pieces incumbent on him as Poet Laureate came in for particular scorn, and these offerings would regularly be followed by a flurry of anonymous parodies, some of which Cibber claimed in his &quot;Apology&quot; to have written himself. In the 20th century, D. B. Wyndham-Lewis and Charles Lee considered some of Cibber&#x27;s laureate poems funny enough to be included in their classic &quot;anthology of bad verse&quot;, &quot;The Stuffed Owl&quot; (1930). However, Cibber was at least as distinguished as his immediate four predecessors, three of whom were also playwrights rather than poets.

==Dunce==

===Pamphlet wars===
From the beginning of the 18th century, when Cibber first rose to be Rich&#x27;s right-hand man at Drury Lane, his perceived opportunism and brash, thick-skinned personality gave rise to many barbs in print, especially against his patchwork plays. The early attacks were mostly anonymous, but Daniel Defoe and Tom Brown are suggested as potential authors. Later, Jonathan Swift, John Dennis and Henry Fielding all lambasted Cibber in print. The most famous conflict Cibber had was with Alexander Pope.

Pope&#x27;s animosity began in 1717 when he helped John Arbuthnot and John Gay write a farce, &quot;Three Hours After Marriage&quot;, in which one of the characters, &quot;Plotwell&quot; was modelled on Cibber. Notwithstanding, Cibber put the play on at Drury Lane with himself playing the part of Plotwell, but the play was not well received. During the staging of a different play, Cibber introduced jokes at the expense of &quot;Three Hours After Marriage&quot;, while Pope was in the audience. Pope was infuriated, as was Gay who got into a physical fight with Cibber on a subsequent visit to the theatre. Pope published a pamphlet satirising Cibber and continued his literary assault for the next 25 years.

In the first version of his landmark literary satire &quot;Dunciad&quot; (1728), Pope referred contemptuously to Cibber&#x27;s &quot;past, vamp&#x27;d, future, old, reviv&#x27;d, new&quot; plays, produced with &quot;less human genius than God gives an ape&quot;. Cibber&#x27;s elevation to laureateship in 1730 further inflamed Pope against him. Cibber was selected for political reasons, as he was a supporter of the Whig government of Robert Walpole, while Pope was a Tory. The selection of Cibber for this honour was widely seen as especially cynical coming at a time when Pope, Gay, Thomson, Ambrose Philips, and Edward Young were all in their prime. As one epigram of the time put it:
Pope, mortified by the elevation of Cibber to laureateship and incredulous at what he held to be the vainglory of his &quot;Apology&quot; (1740), attacked Cibber extensively in his poetry.

Cibber replied mostly with good humour to Pope&#x27;s aspersions (&quot;some of which are in conspicuously bad taste&quot;, as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in &quot;A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so frequently fond of Mr. Cibber&#x27;s name&quot;. In this pamphlet, Cibber&#x27;s most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to Arbuthnot&quot; (1735) to Cibber&#x27;s &quot;whore&quot;, which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. &quot;I must own&quot;, wrote Cibber, &quot;that I believe I know more of your whoring than you do of mine; because I don&#x27;t recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours.&quot; Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the &quot;little-tiny manhood&quot; of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber&#x27;s side, and the story &quot;raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope&#x27;s expense&quot;. Pope made no direct reply, but took one of the most famous revenges in literary history. In the revised &quot;Dunciad&quot; that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.

===King of Dunces===
The derogatory allusions to Cibber in consecutive versions of Pope&#x27;s mock-heroic &quot;Dunciad&quot;, from 1728 to 1743, became more elaborate as the conflict between the two men escalated, until, in the final version of the poem, Pope crowned Cibber King of Dunces. From being merely one symptom of the artistic decay of Britain, he was transformed into the demigod of stupidity, the true son of the goddess Dulness. Apart from the personal quarrel, Pope had reasons of literary appropriateness for letting Cibber take the place of his first choice of King, Lewis Theobald. Theobald, who had embarrassed Pope by contrasting Pope&#x27;s impressionistic Shakespeare edition (1725) with Theobald&#x27;s own scholarly edition (1726), also wrote Whig propaganda for hire, as well as dramatic productions which were to Pope abominations for their mixing of tragedy and comedy and for their &quot;low&quot; pantomime and opera. However, Cibber was an even better King in these respects, more high-profile both as a political opportunist and as the powerful manager of Drury Lane, and with the crowning circumstance that his political allegiances and theatrical successes had gained him the laureateship. To Pope this made him an epitome of all that was wrong with British letters. Pope explains in the &quot;Hyper-critics of Ricardus Aristarchus&quot; prefatory to the 1743 &quot;Dunciad&quot; that Cibber is the perfect hero for a mock-heroic parody, since his &quot;Apology&quot; exhibits every trait necessary for the inversion of an epic hero. An epic hero must have wisdom, courage, and chivalric love, says Pope, and the perfect hero for an anti-epic therefore should have vanity, impudence, and debauchery. As wisdom, courage, and love combine to create magnanimity in a hero, so vanity, impudence, and debauchery combine to make buffoonery for the satiric hero. His revisions, however, were considered too hasty by later critics who pointed out inconsistent passages that damaged his own poem for the sake of personal vindictiveness.

Writing about the degradation of taste brought on by theatrical effects, Pope quotes Cibber&#x27;s own &quot;confessio&quot; in the &quot;Apology&quot;:

Pope&#x27;s notes call Cibber a hypocrite, and in general the attacks on Cibber are conducted in the notes added to the &quot;Dunciad&quot;, and not in the body of the poem. As hero of the &quot;Dunciad&quot;, Cibber merely watches the events of Book II, dreams Book III, and sleeps through Book IV.

Once Pope struck, Cibber became an easy target for other satirists. He was attacked as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the &quot;Apology&quot;, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of &quot;The Champion&quot;. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.

A Farce. By Mr. Doggett&quot; was attributed to Cibber by William Chetwood in his &quot;General History of the Stage&quot; (1749), but John Genest in &quot;Some Account of the English Stage&quot; (1832) thought it was by Thomas Doggett. Other plays attributed to Cibber but probably not by him include &quot;Cinna&#x27;s Conspiracy&quot;, performed at Drury Lane on 19 February 1713, and &quot;The Temple of Dullness&quot; of 1745.

<text>In economics, economic rent is any payment to the owner of a factor of production in excess of the costs needed to bring that factor into production. In classical economics, economic rent is any payment made (including imputed value) or benefit received for non-produced inputs such as location (land) and for assets formed by creating official privilege over natural opportunities (e.g., patents). In the moral economy of neoclassical economics, assuming the market is natural, and does not come about by state and social contrivance, economic rent includes income gained by labor or state beneficiaries or other &quot;contrived&quot; exclusivity, such as labor guilds and unofficial corruption.

== Overview ==
In the moral economy of the economics tradition broadly, economic rent is distinct from producer surplus, or normal profit, both of which are theorized to involve productive human action. Economic rent is also independent of opportunity cost, unlike economic profit, where opportunity cost is an essential component. Economic rent is viewed as unearned revenue while economic profit is a narrower term describing surplus income earned by choosing between risk-adjusted alternatives. Unlike economic profit, economic rent cannot be theoretically eliminated by competition because any actions the recipient of the income may take such as improving the object to be rented will then change the total income to contract rent. Still, the total income is made up of economic profit (earned) plus economic rent (unearned).

For a produced commodity, economic rent may be due to the legal ownership of a patent (a politically enforced right to the use of a process or ingredient). For education and occupational licensing, it is the knowledge, performance, and ethical standards, as well as the cost of permits and licenses that are collectively controlled as to their number, regardless of the competence and willingness of those who wish to compete on price alone in the area being licensed. In regard to labor, economic rent can be created by the existence of mass education, labor laws, state social reproduction supports, democracy, guilds, and labor unions (e.g., higher pay for some workers, where collective action creates a scarcity of such workers, as opposed to an ideal condition where labor competes with other factors of production on price alone). For most other production, including agriculture and extraction, economic rent is due to a scarcity (uneven distribution) of natural resources (e.g., land, oil, or minerals).

When economic rent is privatized, the recipient of economic rent is referred to as a &quot;rentier&quot;.

By contrast, in production theory, if there is no exclusivity and there is perfect competition, there are no economic rents, as competition drives prices down to their floor.

Economic rent is different from other unearned and passive income, including contract rent. This distinction has important implications for public revenue and tax policy. As long as there is sufficient accounting profit, governments can collect a portion of economic rent for the purpose of public finance. For example, economic rent can be collected by a government as royalties or extraction fees in the case of resources such as minerals and oil and gas.

Historically, theories of rent have typically applied to rent received by different factor owners within a single economy. Hossein Mahdavy was the first to introduce the concept of &quot;external rent&quot;, whereby one economy received rent from other economies.

==Definitions==

Since the late 1800s, there have been several substantially different conflicting definitions of the term &quot;economic rent&quot; and some of these definitions continue to be used today, often interchangeably causing considerable confusion.

In the late 1800s, Henry George, best known for his proposal for a single tax on land, defined rent in the context of land (not economic rent) as &quot;the part of the produce that accrues to the owners of land (or other natural capabilities) by virtue of ownership&quot; and as &quot;the share of wealth given to landowners because they have an exclusive right to the use of those natural capabilities.&quot; Other thinkers around the same time conceptualized economic rent as &quot;&quot;incomes analogous to land rents&quot; in the sense of rewarding control over persistently scarce or monopolised assets, rather than labour or sacrifice.&quot; Over time, economists shifted their definition of the term. 

Neoclassical economists defined economic rent as &quot;income in excess of opportunity cost or competitive price.&quot; According to Robert Tollison (1982), economic rents are &quot;excess returns&quot; above the &quot;normal levels&quot; that are generated in competitive markets. More specifically, a rent is &quot;a return in excess of the resource owner&#x27;s opportunity cost&quot;. The law professors Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried define the term as &quot;extra returns that firms or individuals obtain due to their positional advantages.&quot;

In the mid 1900s, public choice theorists began using the term &quot;economic rent&quot; to mean specifically the wealth derived from state-granted rights that transfer wealth to the new right holders from others rather than creating new wealth to be split between producer and consumer. The modern term rent seeking derives from this definition of economic rent.

==Classical rent (land rent) ==
In political economy, including physiocracy, classical economics, Georgism, and other schools of economic thought, land is recognized as an inelastic factor of production. Land, in this sense, means exclusive access rights to any natural opportunity. Rent is the share paid to freeholders for allowing production on the land they control.

David Ricardo is credited with the first clear and comprehensive analysis of differential land rent and the associated economic relationships (law of rent).

Johann Heinrich von Thünen was influential in developing the spatial analysis of rents, which highlighted the importance of centrality and transport. Simply put, it was density of population, increasing the profitability of commerce and providing for the division and specialization of labor, that commanded higher municipal rents. These high rents determined that land in a central city would not be allocated to farming but be allocated instead to more profitable residential or commercial uses.

Observing that a tax on the unearned rent of land would not distort economic activities, Henry George proposed that publicly collected land rents (land value taxation) should be the primary (or only) source of public revenue, though he also advocated public ownership, taxation, and regulation of natural monopolies and monopolies of scale that cannot be eliminated by regulation.

==Neoclassical Paretian rent==
Neoclassical economics extends the concept of rent to include factors other than natural resource rents.
* &quot;The excess earnings over the amount necessary to keep the factor in its current occupation.&quot;
* &quot;The difference between what a factor of production is paid and how much it would need to be paid to remain in its current use.&quot;
* &quot;A return over and above opportunity costs, or the normal return necessary to keep a resource in its current use.&quot;
The labeling of this version of rent as &quot;Paretian&quot; may be a misnomer in that Vilfredo Pareto, the economist for whom this kind of rent was named, may or may not have proffered any conceptual formulation of rent.

==Monopoly rent==
Monopoly rent refers to those economic rents derived from monopolies, which can result from (1) denial of access to an asset or (2) the unique qualities of an asset. Examples of monopoly rent include: rents associated from legally enforced knowledge monopolies derived from intellectual property like patents or copyrights; rents associated with &#x27;de facto&#x27; monopolies of companies like Microsoft and Intel who control the underlying standards in an industry or product line (e.g. Microsoft Office); rents associated with &#x27;natural monopolies&#x27; of public or private utilities (e.g. telephone, electricity, railways, etc.); and rents associated with network effects of platform technologies controlled by companies like Facebook, Google, or Amazon.

An antitrust probe described Google Play and Apple App Store fees as &quot;monopoly rents&quot;.

==Labour==

The generalization of the concept of rent to include opportunity cost has served to highlight the role of political barriers in creating and privatizing rents. For example, a person seeking to become a member of a medieval guild makes a huge investment in training and education, which has limited potential application outside of that guild. In a competitive market, the wages of a member of the guild would be set so that the expected net return on the investment in training would be just enough to justify making the investment. In a sense, the required investment is a natural barrier to entry, discouraging some would-be members from making the necessary investment in training to enter the competitive market for the services of the guild. This is a natural &quot;free market&quot; self-limiting control on the number of guild members and/or the cost of training necessitated by certification. Some of those who would have opted for a particular guild may decide to join a different guild or occupation.

However, a political restriction on the number of people entering into the competitive market for services of the guild has the effect of raising the return on investments in the guild&#x27;s training, especially for those already practicing, by creating an artificial scarcity of guild members. To the extent that a constraint on entrants to the guild actually increases the returns to guild members as opposed to ensuring competence, then the practice of limiting entrants to the field is a rent-seeking activity, and the excess return realized by the guild members is economic rent.

The same model explains the high wages in some modern professions that have been able to both obtain legal protection from competition and limit their membership, notably medical doctors, actuaries, and lawyers. In countries where the creation of new universities is limited by legal charter, such as the UK, it also applies to professors. It may also apply to careers that are inherently competitive in the sense that there is a fixed number of slots, such as football league positions, music charts, or urban territory for illegal drug selling. These jobs are characterised by the existence of a small number of rich members of the guild, along with a much larger surrounding of poor people competing against each other under very poor conditions as they &quot;pay their dues&quot; to try to join the guild. (Reference: &quot;Freakonomics: Why do drug dealers live with their Moms?&quot;).

==Terminology relating to rent==
; Gross rent: Gross rent refers to the rent paid for the services of land and the capital invested on it. It consists of economic rent, interest on capital invested for improvement of land, and reward for the risk taken by the landlord in investing his or her capital.

; Scarcity rent: Scarcity rent refers to the price paid for the use of homogeneous land when its supply is limited in relation to demand. If all units of land are homogeneous but demand exceeds supply, all land will earn economic rent by virtue of its scarcity.

; Differential rent: Differential rent refers to the rent that arises owing to differences in fertility of land. The surplus that arises due to difference between the marginal and intra-marginal land is the differential rent. It is generally accrued under conditions of extensive land cultivation. The term was first proposed by David Ricardo.

; Contract rent: Contract rent refers to rent that is mutually agreed upon between the landowner and the user. It may be equal to the economic rent of the factor.

; Information rent: Information rent is rent an agent derives from having information not provided to the principal.

<doc id="216665" wikidata="Q7269424" url="?curid=216665" title="Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies">
<text>Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies is a 1987 book by Halton Arp, an astronomer famous for his &quot;Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies&quot; (1966). Arp argued that many [[quasar]s with otherwise high [[redshift]] are somehow linked to close objects such as nearby [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Arp also argued that some galaxies showed unusual redshifts, and that redshifts themselves could be [[redshift quantization|quantized]].

These are controversial views which do not accord with the standard [[model (abstract)|model]] of [[physical cosmology]]. It also contradicts the accepted model that [[quasar]]s are bright nuclei of very distant galaxies. Most astronomers reject Arp&#x27;s interpretation of the data since the anomalous observations could be explained by perspective effects. Reportedly, some of Arp&#x27;s calculations seem to be simply &quot;bad mathematics&quot;. Arp asserted that many questions he posed to the scientific establishment are still unanswered and that his requests for more observation time had been systematically rejected.

[[Halton Arp]]&#x27;s proposal was an idea based on analyses done before the [[galaxy survey|sky surveys]] increased the number of measured redshifts by several orders of magnitude. The idea was that the cosmological redshift might be showing evidence of periodicity which would be difficult to explain in a [[Hubble&#x27;s law]] universe that had the feature of continuous expansion. However, most astronomers agree that the analysis suffers from poor methodology and [[Hasty generalization|small number statistics]].

Halton Arp continued to report the existence of apparently connected objects with very different redshifts. Arp has interpreted these connections to mean that these objects are in fact physically connected. He further hypothesized that the higher redshift objects are ejected from the lower redshift objects - which are usually active galactic nuclei (AGN)- and that the large observed redshifts of these &quot;ejected&quot; objects is dominated by a non-cosmological (intrinsic) component. The rest of the community regards these as chance alignments and Arp&#x27;s hypothesis has very few supporters.

The book has been translated into Italian and Spanish, as of 1998.

His work is updated in his last book, &quot;Catalogue of Discordant Redshift Associations&quot;, C. Roy Keys Inc. (February, 2003), .

<text>Silvie Tomčalová (born 12 February 1976), known as Silvia Saint, is a Czech former pornographic actress. In 1996, she was &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Year in the Czech edition of the magazine. She has appeared in over 300 pornographic movies.

==Early life==
Silvia Saint was born Silvia Tomcalova on 12 February 1976, in what is now the Czech Republic. She was an only child who faced many hardships in her life, including poverty and the death of her father when she was young.

==Career==
Saint began in erotic modeling, first lingerie, then nude in magazines and finally in pornographic films. She was &quot;Penthouse Pet of the Year&quot; in 1996 (Czech edition). After her introduction to the American porn industry, she became the October 1998 &quot;Penthouse Pet of the Month&quot; (U.S. edition).

Saint&#x27;s early films were shot in Europe, many for Private Media Group. She performed in a Private Media Group sex in space-themed pornographic film &quot;The Uranus Experiment: Part Two&quot;, which featured a brief scene filmed in a Russian aircraft flying a parabolic track (similar to NASA&#x27;s Vomit Comet). The film featured around 20 seconds of Saint and Nick Lang (who both portray astronauts living on a space station) having penetrative sex in freefall. The scene was nominated for a Nebula Award, but it did not win.

Saint was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at Torino Sex 2005, Turin&#x27;s second annual Delta of Venus Fair.

In 2006, she won the rights to the Internet domain name silviasaint.com from a cybersquatter in a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy action. In 2007, the mobile game &quot;Sylvia Saint in Erotic Pool&quot; was released for Java ME-supported phones. Since 2007, she has only starred and performed in lesbian sex movies, while also taking care of the auditions as director and producer to her official website.

<text>Paul Anthony Samuelson (May 15, 1915 – December 13, 2009) was an American economist who was the first American to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. When awarding the prize in 1970, the Swedish Royal Academies stated that he &quot;has done more than any other contemporary economist to raise the level of scientific analysis in economic theory&quot;. 

Samuelson was one of the most influential economists of the latter half of the 20th century. In 1996, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. Samuelson considered mathematics to be the &quot;natural language&quot; for economists and contributed significantly to the mathematical foundations of economics with his book &quot;Foundations of Economic Analysis&quot;. He was author of the best-selling economics textbook of all time: &quot;&quot;, first published in 1948. It was the second American textbook that attempted to explain the principles of Keynesian economics. 

Samuelson served as an advisor to President John F. Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson, and was a consultant to the United States Treasury, the Bureau of the Budget and the President&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers. Samuelson wrote a weekly column for &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine along with Chicago School economist Milton Friedman, where they represented opposing sides: Samuelson, as a self described &quot;Cafeteria Keynesian&quot;, claimed taking the Keynesian perspective but only accepting what he felt was good in it. By contrast, Friedman represented the monetarist perspective. Together with Henry Wallich, their 1967 columns earned the magazine a Gerald Loeb Special Award in 1968.

==Biography==

Samuelson was born in Gary, Indiana, on May 15, 1915, to Frank Samuelson, a pharmacist, and Ella &quot;née&quot; Lipton. His family, he later said, was &quot;made up of upwardly mobile Jewish immigrants from Poland who had prospered considerably in World War I, because Gary was a brand new steel-town when my family went there&quot;. In 1923, Samuelson moved to Chicago where he graduated from Hyde Park High School (now Hyde Park Career Academy).

Samuelson attended the University of Chicago as an undergraduate, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1935. He said he was born as an economist at 8:00 am on January 2, 1932, in the University of Chicago classroom. The lecture mentioned as the cause was on the British economist Thomas Malthus, who most famously studied population growth and its effects. Samuelson felt there was a dissonance between neoclassical economics and the way the system seemed to behave; he said Henry Simons and Frank Knight were a big influence on him. He next completed his Master of Arts degree in 1936, and his Doctor of Philosophy in 1941 at Harvard University. He won the David A. Wells prize in 1941 for writing the best doctoral dissertation at Harvard University in economics, for a thesis titled &quot;Foundations of Analytical Economics&quot;, which later turned into &quot;Foundations of Economic Analysis&quot;. As a graduate student at Harvard, Samuelson studied economics under Joseph Schumpeter, Wassily Leontief, Gottfried Haberler, and the &quot;American Keynes&quot; Alvin Hansen.

Samuelson moved to MIT as an assistant professor in 1940 and remained there until his death. Samuelson&#x27;s biographer argues that a central reason for Samuelson&#x27;s move from Harvard to MIT was the anti-Semitism that was famously widespread at Harvard at the time. In a 1989 letter to his friend Henry Rosovsky, Samuelson blamed anti-Semitism in Harvard economics above all on chair Harold Burbank, as well as on Edward Chamberlin, John H. Williams, John D. Black, and Leonard Crum.

Samuelson&#x27;s family included many well-known economists, including brother Robert Summers, sister-in-law Anita Summers, brother-in-law Kenneth Arrow and nephew Larry Summers.

During his seven decades as an economist, Samuelson&#x27;s professional positions included:
* Assistant professor of economics at MIT, 1940; associate professor, 1944.
* Member of the Radiation Laboratory 1944–45.
* Professor of international economic relations (part-time) at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1945.
* Guggenheim Fellowship from 1948 to 1949
* Professor of economics at MIT beginning in 1947 and Institute Professor beginning in 1962.
* Vernon F. Taylor Visiting Distinguished Professor at Trinity University (Texas) in spring 1989.

===Death===
Samuelson died after a brief illness on December 13, 2009, at the age of 94. His death was announced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. James M. Poterba, an economics professor at MIT and the president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, commented that Samuelson &quot;leaves an immense legacy, as a researcher and a teacher, as one of the giants on whose shoulders every contemporary economist stands&quot;. Susan Hockfield, the president of MIT, said that Samuelson &quot;transformed everything he touched: the theoretical foundations of his field, the way economics was taught around the world, the ethos and stature of his department, the investment practices of MIT, and the lives of his colleagues and students&quot;. His second wife died in 2019.

==Fields of interest==
As professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Samuelson worked in many fields, including:
* Consumer theory, where he pioneered the revealed preference approach, which is a method by which one can discern a consumer&#x27;s utility function, by observing their behavior. Rather than postulate a utility function or a preference ordering, Samuelson imposed conditions directly on the choices made by individuals – their preferences as revealed by their choices.
* Welfare economics and public finance theory, in which he popularised the Lindahl–Bowen–Samuelson conditions (criteria for deciding whether an action will improve welfare) and demonstrated in 1950 the insufficiency of a national-income index to reveal which of two social options was uniformly outside the other&#x27;s (feasible) possibility function, and he is particularly known for his work on determining the optimal allocation of resources in the presence of both public goods and private goods.
* Capital theory, where he is known for 1958 consumption loans model and a variety of turnpike theorems and involved in Cambridge capital controversy.
* Finance theory, in which he is known for the random walk hypothesis and efficient-market hypothesis.
* International economics, where he influenced the development of two important international trade models: the Balassa–Samuelson effect, and the Heckscher–Ohlin model (with the Stolper–Samuelson theorem).
* Macroeconomics, where he popularized the overlapping generations model as a way to analyze economic agents&#x27; behavior across multiple periods of time, developed multiplier-accelerator model, analyzed Phillips curve, and contributed to formation of the neoclassical synthesis.

==Impact==
Samuelson is considered one of the founders of neo-Keynesian economics and a seminal figure in the development of neoclassical economics. In awarding him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, the committee stated:

He was also essential in creating the neoclassical synthesis, which ostensibly incorporated Keynesian and neoclassical principles and still dominates current mainstream economics. In 2003, Samuelson was one of the ten Nobel Prize–winning economists signing the Economists&#x27; statement opposing the Bush tax cuts.

Samuelson believed unregulated markets have drawbacks, he stated, &quot;free markets do not stabilise themselves. Zero regulating is vastly suboptimal to rational regulating. Libertarianism is its own worst enemy!&quot; Samuelson strongly criticised Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, arguing their opposition to state intervention &quot;tells us something about them rather than something about Genghis Khan or Franklin Roosevelt. It is paranoid to warn against inevitable slippery slopes ... once individual commercial freedoms are in any way infringed upon.&quot;

==Aphorisms and quotations==
Stanislaw Ulam once challenged Samuelson to name one theory in all of the social sciences that is both true and nontrivial. Several years later, Samuelson responded with David Ricardo&#x27;s theory of comparative advantage: &quot;That it is logically true need not be argued before a mathematician; that is not trivial is attested by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them.&quot;

For many years, Samuelson wrote a column for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. One article included Samuelson&#x27;s most quoted remark and a favorite economics joke:

To prove that Wall Street is an early omen of movements still to come in GNP, commentators quote economic studies alleging that market downturns predicted four out of the last five recessions. That is an understatement. Wall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions! And its mistakes were beauties.

In the early editions of his famous, bestselling economics textbook Paul Samuelson joked that GDP falls when a man &quot;marries his maid&quot;.

==Publications==
===&quot;Foundations of Economic Analysis&quot;===
Paul Samuelson&#x27;s book &quot;Foundations of Economic Analysis&quot; (1946) is considered his magnum opus. It is derived from his doctoral dissertation, and was inspired by the classical thermodynamic methods. The book proposes to:
* Examine underlying analogies between central features in theoretical and applied economics and
* Study how &quot;operationally meaningful theorems&quot; can be derived with a small number of &quot;analogous methods&quot; (p. 3),
in order to derive &quot;a general theory of economic theories&quot; (Samuelson, 1983, p. xxvi). The book showed how these goals could be parsimoniously and fruitfully achieved, using the language of the mathematics applied to diverse subfields of economics. The book proposes two general hypotheses as sufficient for its purposes:
* &quot;Maximizing behavior&quot; of &quot;agents&quot; (including &quot;consumers&quot; as to utility and &quot;business firms&quot; as to profit) and
* Economic &quot;systems&quot; (including a market and an economy) in &quot;stable equilibrium&quot;.
The first tenet suggests that all actors, whether firms or consumers, are striving to maximize something. They could be attempting to maximize profits, utility, or wealth, but it did not matter because their efforts to improve their well-being would provide a basic model for all actors in an economic system. His second tenet focuses on providing insight on the workings of equilibrium in an economy. Generally in a market, supply would equal demand. However, he noted that this isn&#x27;t always the case and that the important thing to look at was a system&#x27;s natural resting point. &quot;Foundations&quot; presents the question of how an equilibrium would react when it is moved from its optimal point. Samuelson was also influential in providing explanations on how the changes in certain factors can affect an economic system. For example, he could explain the economic effect of changes in taxes or new technologies.

In the course of analysis, &quot;comparative statics&quot;, (the analysis of changes in equilibrium of the system that result from a parameter change of the system) is formalized and clearly stated.

The chapter on welfare economics &quot;attempt(s) to give a brief but fairly complete survey of the whole field of welfare economics&quot; (Samuelson, 1947, p. 252). It also exposits on and develops what became commonly called the Bergson–Samuelson social welfare function. It shows how to represent (in the maximization calculus) all real-valued economic measures of any belief system that is required to rank consistently different feasible social configurations in an ethical sense as &quot;better than&quot;, &quot;worse than&quot;, or &quot;indifferent to&quot; each other (p. 221).

===&quot;Economics&quot;===

Samuelson is also author (and from 1985 co-author) of an influential principles textbook, &quot;&quot;, first published in 1948 (19th ed. as of 2010; multiple reprints). The book sold more than 300,000 copies of each edition from 1961 through 1976 and was translated into forty-one languages. As of 2018, it had sold over four million copies. William Nordhaus joined as co-author on the 12th edition (1985). Sometime before 1988, it had become the best-selling economics textbook of all time.

Samuelson was once quoted as saying, &quot;Let those who will write the nation&#x27;s laws if I can write its textbooks.&quot; Written in the shadow of the Great Depression and the Second World War, it helped to popularize the insights of John Maynard Keynes. A main focus was how to avoid, or at least mitigate, the recurring slumps in economic activity.

Samuelson wrote: &quot;It is not too much to say that the widespread creation of dictatorships and the resulting World War II stemmed in no small measure from the world&#x27;s failure to meet this basic economic problem [the Great Depression] adequately.&quot; This reflected the concern of Keynes himself with the economic causes of war and the importance of economic policy in promoting peace.

Samuelson&#x27;s book was the second to introduce Keynesian economics to a wide audience, and was by far the most successful. Canadian economist Lorie Tarshis, who had been a student attending Keynes&#x27;s lectures at Harvard in the 1930s, published in 1947 an introductory textbook that incorporated his lecture notes, titled &quot;Elements of Economics&quot;.

Samuelson&#x27;s textbook was a watershed in introducing the serious study of business cycles to the economics curriculum. It was particularly timely because it followed the Great Depression. The study of business cycles along with the introduction of the Keynesian approach of aggregate demand set the stage for the macroeconomic revolution in America, which then diffused throughout the world through translations into every major language. Generations of students, who then became teachers, learned their first and most influential lessons from Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;Economics.&quot; It attracted many imitators, who became successful in different niches of the college market.

The text was not without criticism. While it praised the &quot;mixed economy&quot; of market and government, some found that too radical and attacked it as socialist. As a precursor to criticisms of Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;Economics&quot; textbook, Lorie Tarshis&#x27;s textbook was attacked by trustees of, and donors to, American colleges and universities as preaching a &quot;socialist heresy&quot;. Piling on, William F. Buckley, Jr., in his 1951 book, &quot;God and Man at Yale,&quot; devoted an entire chapter, attacking both Samuelson&#x27;s and Tarshis&#x27; textbooks. For Samuelson&#x27;s book, Buckley drew from the &quot;Educational Examiner&quot; and credited it as an &quot;excellent review of Samuelson&#x27;s text.&quot; (&quot;Note to Chapter Two.&quot; p. 234) For Tarshis&#x27; book, Buckley drew from Merwin K. Hart&#x27;s organization : &quot;I am also grateful to the National Economic Council for its telling analysis of the Tarshis.&quot; (&quot;Note to Chapter Two.&quot; p. 234) Buckley essentially characterized both as – in the words of Paul Davidson – &quot;communist inspired&quot;. Buckley, for the rest of his life, defended the criticisms set forth in his book.

===Other publications===
There are 388 papers in Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;Collected Scientific Papers&quot;. Stanley Fischer (1987, p. 234) writes that taken together they are &quot;unique in their verve, breadth of economic and general knowledge, mastery of setting, and generosity of allusions to predecessors&quot;.

Samuelson was co-editor, along with William A. Barnett, of &quot;Inside the Economist&#x27;s Mind: Conversations with Eminent Economists&quot; (Blackwell Publishing, 2007), a collection of interviews with notable economists of the 20th century.

<text>Arthur Cecil Pigou (; 18 November 1877 – 7 March 1959) was an English economist. As a teacher and builder of the School of Economics at the University of Cambridge, he trained and influenced many Cambridge economists who went on to take chairs of economics around the world. His work covered various fields of economics, particularly welfare economics, but also included business cycle theory, unemployment, public finance, index numbers, and measurement of national output. His reputation was affected adversely by influential economic writers who used his work as the basis on which to define their own opposing views. He reluctantly served on several public committees, including the Cunliffe Committee and the 1919 Royal Commission on income tax.

==Early life and education==
Pigou was born at Ryde on the Isle of Wight, the son of Clarence George Scott Pigou, an army officer, and his wife Nora Biddel Frances Sophia, daughter of Sir John Lees, 3rd Baronet. He won a scholarship to Harrow School, where he was in Newlands house and became the first modern head of school. The school&#x27;s economics society is named The Pigou Society in his honour. In 1896 he was admitted as a history scholar to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he first read history under Oscar Browning. He won the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal for English Verse in 1899, and the Cobden (1901), Burney (1901), and Adam Smith Prizes (1903), and made his mark in the Cambridge Union Society, of which he was President in 1900. He came to economics through the study of philosophy and ethics under the Moral Science Tripos. He studied economics under Alfred Marshall, whom he later succeeded as professor of political economy. His first and unsuccessful attempt at a fellowship of King&#x27;s was a thesis on &quot;Browning as a Religious Teacher&quot;.

==Academic work==
Pigou began lecturing on economics in 1901 and started giving the course on advanced economics to second year students on which was based the education of many Cambridge economists over the next thirty years. In his early days he lectured on a variety of subjects outside economics. He became a Fellow of King&#x27;s College on his second attempt in March 1902, and was appointed Girdler&#x27;s Lecturer in the summer of 1904. He devoted himself to exploring the various departments of economic doctrine, and as a result published the works on which his worldwide reputation rests. He specifically studied under Alfred Marshall and focused on normative economics. He became intrigued by welfare economics, which examines the overall benefit to society that comes from all the decisions made: those that individuals make about buying, selling and working, and those that firms make about production and employment. His first work was more philosophical than his later work, as he expanded the essay which had won him the Adam Smith Prize in 1903 into &quot;Principles and Methods of Industrial Peace&quot;.

In 1908 Pigou was elected Professor of Political Economy at the University of Cambridge in succession to Alfred Marshall. He held the post until 1943.

In 1909 he wrote an essay in favour of Land Value Taxation, likely to be interpreted as support for Lloyd George&#x27;s People&#x27;s Budget. Marshall&#x27;s views on the land value tax were the inspiration for his view on taxing negative externalities.

Pigou&#x27;s most enduring contribution was &quot;The Economics of Welfare&quot;, 1920, in which he introduced the concept of externality and the idea that externality problems could be corrected by the imposition of a Pigovian tax (also spelled &quot;Pigouvian tax&quot;). In &quot;The Economics of Welfare&quot; (initially called &quot;Wealth and Welfare&quot;), Pigou developed Marshall’s concept of externality, which is a cost imposed or benefit conferred on others that is not accounted for by the person who creates these costs or benefits. Pigou argued that negative externalities (costs imposed) should be offset by a tax, while positive externalities should be offset by a subsidy. Pigou&#x27;s contemporary, Frank H. Knight, described the work as &quot;monumental&quot; and &quot;economics at its best.&quot; In the early 1960s Pigou&#x27;s analysis was criticised by Ronald Coase, who argued that taxes and subsidies are not necessary if the partners in the transaction can bargain over the transaction. The externality concept remains central to modern welfare economics and particularly to environmental economics. The Pigou Club, named in his honour, is an association of modern economists who support the idea of a carbon tax to address the problem of climate change.

A neglected aspect of Pigou&#x27;s work is his analysis of a range of labour-market phenomena studied by subsequent economists, including collective bargaining, wage rigidity, internal labour markets, segmented labour market, and human capital. Sticky wages are when workers’ earnings don’t
adjust quickly to changes in labour market conditions. This can slow an economy&#x27;s recovery from a recession.

Pigou’s contributions to solving unemployment serve as a basic foundation for understanding the phenomena of labor market externalities. His &quot;Theory of Unemployment&quot;, first published in 1933, describe many of the factors that contribute to unemployment, such as sticky wages, and an unwillingness to work at the market price. Both of these are factors that were given by Alfred Marshall and reinforced by Pigou. Up until the post-World War One era, frictional unemployment was understood as part of a functional market. However, Pigou also notes that there is another type of unemployment that emerges not because people are unwilling to work at market wages but because employers have lower demand for labor. With the lack of employment that resulted from the devastation of four years of war, England suffered from an economic depression long before the Great Depression, due in part to the fact that employers were hesitant to continue to hire women and veterans. This new factor of unemployment, Pigou writes, could be solved with subsidies provided by the government to industries suffering the most, such as manufacturing.

Keynes argues against several points that Pigou makes in his &quot;Theory of Unemployment&quot;, but the most visible is Pigou’s theory that unemployment is either frictional or voluntary. However, the separation between frictional and voluntary unemployment is the first foray into understanding the way unemployment impacts the labor market until the publishing of Keynes &quot;General Theory&quot;.

One of his early acts was to provide private financial support for John Maynard Keynes to work on probability theory. Pigou and Keynes had great mutual affection and regard for each other, and their intellectual differences never put their personal friendship seriously in jeopardy.

Pigou was generally critical of Keynesian macroeconomics and developed the idea of the Pigou effect on real money balances to argue that the economy would be more self-stabilizing than Keynes proposed. In a couple of lectures delivered in 1949 he made a more favourable, though still critical evaluation of Keynes&#x27; work: &quot;I should say... that in setting out and developing his fundamental conception, Keynes made a very important, original and valuable addition to the armoury of economic analysis&quot;. He later said that he had come with the passage of time to feel that he had failed earlier to appreciate some of the important things that Keynes was trying to say.

Keynes, in turn, was very critical of Pigou, mentioning Pigou at least 17 times in &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, usually disparagingly. Keynes states that &quot;[Pigou] is unable to devise any satisfactory formula to evaluate new equipment against old when, owing to changes in technique, the two are not identical. I believe that the concept at which Professor Pigou is aiming is the right and appropriate concept for economic analysis. But, until a satisfactory
system of units has been adopted, its precise definition is an impossible task.&quot;

==Personal life==
Pigou had strong principles, and these gave him some problems in World War I. He was a conscientious objector to military service when it required an obligation to destroy human life. He remained at Cambridge, but during the vacations was an ambulance driver at the front for the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit, and insisted on undertaking jobs of particular danger. Towards the end of the war he reluctantly accepted a post in the Board of Trade, but showed little aptitude for the work.

He was a reluctant member of the Cunliffe Committee on the Currency and Foreign Exchange (1918–1919), the Royal Commission on the Income Tax (1919–1920), and the Chamberlain Committee on the Currency and Bank of England Note Issues (1924–1925). The report of the last body was the prelude to the much criticised restoration of the gold standard at the old parity of exchange. Pigou was elected to the British Academy in 1925, but resigned later in 1947. In later years he withdrew from national affairs and devoted himself to more academic economics and writing weighty letters to &quot;The Times&quot; on problems of the day. He was a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a foreign member of the Accademia dei Lincei, and an honorary resident of the International Economic Committee.

He loved mountains and climbing, and introduced climbing to many friends, such as Wilfrid Noyce and others, who became far greater climbers. An illness affecting his heart developed in the early 1930s, however, and this affected his vigour, curtailing his climbing and leaving him with phases of debility for the rest of his life. Pigou gave up his professor&#x27;s chair in 1943, but remained a Fellow of King&#x27;s College until his death. In his later years he gradually became more of a recluse, emerging occasionally from his rooms to give lectures or to take a walk.

Pigou never married. He had good friendships, particularly in his later years. He had a penchant for complaining about politicians.

<text>John Thomas Draper (born March 11, 1943), also known as Captain Crunch, Crunch, or Crunchman (after the Cap&#x27;n Crunch breakfast cereal mascot and the free toy plastic Cap&#x27;n Crunch bo&#x27;sun whistle used to hack phone calls), is an American computer programmer and former phone phreak. He is a widely known figure within the computer programming world and the hacker and security community, and generally lives a nomadic lifestyle.

== Early life ==
Draper is the son of a United States Air Force engineer. As a child, he built a home radio station from discarded military components. He was frequently bullied in school and briefly received psychological treatment.

After taking college courses, Draper enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1964. While stationed in Alaska, he helped his fellow service members make free phone calls home by devising access to a local telephone switchboard. In 1967, while stationed at Charleston Air Force Station in Maine, he created WKOS (W-&quot;chaos&quot;), a pirate radio station in nearby Dover-Foxcroft, but shut it down after a legally-licensed radio station, WDME, objected.

Draper was honorably discharged from the Air Force as an airman first class in 1968. He moved to Silicon Valley and briefly worked for National Semiconductor as an engineering technician and at Hugle International, where he worked on early designs for a cordless telephone. He also attended De Anza College on a part-time basis through 1972.

During this period, he also worked as an engineer and disc jockey for KKUP in Cupertino, California and adopted the countercultural styles of the time by wearing long hair and smoking marijuana.

== Career ==
=== Phreaking ===

While testing a pirate radio transmitter he had built, Draper broadcast a telephone number to listeners seeking feedback to gauge the station&#x27;s reception. A call from fellow pirate radio operator Denny Teresi resulted in a meeting that led Draper into the world of &quot;phone phreaks&quot;, people who study and experiment with telephone networks, and who sometimes use that knowledge to make free calls. Teresi and several other phone phreaks were blind. Learning of Draper&#x27;s knowledge of electronic design, they asked him to build a multifrequency tone generator, known informally as a blue box, a device for emitting audio tones used to control the phone network. The group had previously used an organ and cassette recordings of tones to make free calls. Among the phone phreaks, one blind boy who had taken the moniker of Joybubbles had perfect pitch and was able to identify frequencies precisely.

Draper learned that a toy whistle packaged in boxes of Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal emitted a tone at precisely 2600 hertz—the same frequency that AT&amp;T long lines used to indicate that a trunk line was available for routing a new call. The tone disconnected one end of the trunk while the still-connected side entered operator mode. The vulnerability they had exploited was limited to call-routing switches that relied on in-band signaling. After 1980 and the introduction of Signalling System No. 7 most U.S. phone lines relied almost exclusively on out-of-band signaling. This change rendered the toy whistles and blue boxes useless for phreaking purposes. The whistles are considered collectible souvenirs of a bygone era, and the magazine &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly&quot; is named after the audio frequency.

====Profile by &quot;Esquire&quot;====
In 1971, journalist Ron Rosenbaum wrote about phone phreaking for &quot;Esquire.&quot; The article relied heavily on interviews with Draper and conferred upon him a sort of celebrity status among people interested in the counterculture. When first contacted by Rosenbaum about the story, Draper was ambivalent about being interviewed, but also, in the same breath, explained his prevailing ethos:

The article caught the attention of University of California, Berkeley engineering student and future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who located Draper while working as an engineer at the radio station KKUP. Wozniak and Draper met to compare techniques for building blue boxes. Also present was Wozniak&#x27;s friend Steve Jobs. Wozniak and Jobs later set up a small business selling blue boxes.

====Toll fraud criminal cases====

The notoriety of the &quot;Esquire&quot; article led to Draper&#x27;s arrest by the FBI in May 1972 on charges of toll fraud. The charges stemmed from having been caught illegally calling a phone number in Sydney, Australia, that played a recorded message listing that country&#x27;s most popular songs. He was sentenced to five years probation, and under its terms, he was forbidden to share his technical knowledge for building blue boxes and making free calls.

Following that conviction, Draper remained under FBI surveillance. A 1976 report by an informant that Draper had violated his probation agreement by sharing blue box techniques led to a second conviction and a four-month stint in the federal prison in Lompoc, California. A third toll fraud conviction, stemming from an arrest for making $50,000 worth of free phone calls followed in 1978, along with a second prison sentence.

=== Hardware and software developer ===

====Apple Computer====
In 1977, Draper worked for Apple as an independent contractor, and was assigned by Wozniak to develop a device that could connect the Apple II computer to phone lines. Wozniak said he thought computers could act like an answering machine, and modems were not yet widely available. Draper designed an interface device dubbed the &quot;Charlie Board&quot;, which was designed to dial toll-free telephone numbers used by many corporations and to emit touch-tones that would grant access to the WATS lines in use by those companies. In theory, this would allow unlimited and free long-distance phone calls. Upon learning of the Charlie Board&#x27;s capabilities, Apple&#x27;s CEO Mike Scott canceled the project immediately. Some of its techniques were later used in tone-activated calling menus, voicemail, and other services.

&quot;It was an incredible board. But no one at Apple liked Crunch. Only me. They wouldn&#x27;t let his device become a product&quot;, Wozniak said of the episode in a speech in 2004.

==== Easywriter ====
While on a work-release program during his third period of incarceration in 1979, Draper wrote EasyWriter, the first word processor for the Apple II. He was inspired in part by Electric Pencil, an early word processor. Draper later ported EasyWriter to the IBM PC after a demonstration of it caught the attention of the founders of Information Unlimited Software, a small software company based in Marin County. IBM selected it as the machine&#x27;s official word processor after failing to reach a deal with MicroPro International for WordStar. While the original was popular with Apple II users, the IBM port was poorly received by customers. IBM was forced to offer free updates.

Draper formed a software company called Capn&#x27; Software, but it booked less than $1 million in revenue over six years. Distributor Bill Baker also hired other programmers to create a follow-up program, Easywriter II, without Draper&#x27;s knowledge. Draper sued and the case was later settled out-of-court.

==== Autodesk and other ventures ====
Draper joined Autodesk in 1986, designing video driver software in a role offered to him directly by co-founder John Walker. In 1987, Draper was charged in a scheme to forge tickets for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. He pled guilty to lesser misdemeanor charges in 1988 and entered a diversion program. While facing prosecution, he remained on the Autodesk payroll but did not work for the company until he was fired the following year.

From 1999 to 2004, Draper was the chief technical officer for ShopIP, a computer security firm that designed The Crunchbox GE, a firewall device running OpenBSD. Despite endorsements from Wozniak, and publicity from media profiles, the product failed to achieve commercial success.

In 2007, Draper was named chief technology officer at En2go, a software company that developed media delivery tools. The company had previously been named Medusa Style Corp. It is unclear when Draper&#x27;s involvement in the company ceased; however, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission document the resignations of several of its officers, including Wozniak, during the summer of 2009. En2Go never achieved commercial success.

=== Allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior ===
In 2017, organizers of at least four hacking and security-related conferences (including DEF CON, HOPE, and ToorCon) said they had banned Draper from attending in the wake of allegations against him concerning unwanted sexual attention toward other attendees. The allegations were reported in two stories by BuzzFeed News.

Further allegations against Draper emerged in reporting by The Parallax. In the story, University of Pennsylvania computer science professor Matt Blaze asserted that Draper subjected him to a stalking campaign in the 1970s when he was a teenager and when Draper would have been in his thirties. Additionally, journalist Phil Lapsley alleged that Draper consented to an interview in exchange for a partially clothed piggyback ride.

Following reports of the allegations, Draper said that he has Asperger syndrome, which he said could have contributed to his behavior. He denied some of the allegations in an interview with &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; and did not answer others. He denied any explicit sexual intent and instead described the encounters as an &quot;energy workout&quot; employing techniques of applied kinesiology, a discredited form of alternative medicine of which he claims to be an advocate. Draper conceded that in some instances he may have experienced an erection during the encounters, which allegedly included massages of the leg and arm muscles as well as squats and pushups while carrying Draper&#x27;s bodyweight.

Draper was one of the key figures in the 1984 book &quot;&quot; by Steven Levy. The book chronicles the rise of the hacker subculture in the 1970s and 1980s.

In scenes depicting his interactions with Wozniak and Jobs, Draper was portrayed by the actor Wayne Péré in the 1999 made-for-TV film &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;.

The 2001 documentary film &quot;The Secret History of Hacking&quot;, features interviews with Draper, Steve Wozniak, Kevin Mitnick, and other notable figures in the hacking community.

Draper is also mentioned throughout the poem &quot;Phone Phreaking&quot; by Neil Hilborn, in his collection &quot;Our Numbered Days&quot;.

<doc id="216676" wikidata="Q17092469" url="?curid=216676" title="Eutheria">
<text>Eutheria (from Greek , &#x27;good, right&#x27; and , &#x27;beast&#x27;; ), also called Pan-Placentalia, is the clade consisting of placentals and all therian mammals that are more closely related to placentals than to marsupials.

Eutherians are distinguished from non-eutherians by various phenotypic traits of the feet, ankles, jaws and teeth. All extant eutherians lack epipubic bones, which are present in all other living mammals (marsupials and monotremes). This allows for expansion of the abdomen during pregnancy, though epipubic bones are present in many primitive eutherians. Eutheria was named in 1872 by Theodore Gill; in 1880, Thomas Henry Huxley defined it to encompass a more broadly defined group than Placentalia.

The earliest unambiguous eutherians are known from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of China, dating around 120 million years ago. Two tribosphenic mammals, &quot;Durlstodon&quot; and &quot;Durlstotherium&quot; from the Berriasian age (~145–140 million years ago) of the Early Cretaceous in southern England have also been suggested to represent early eutherians. Another possible eutherian species &quot;Juramaia sinensis&quot; has been dated at from the early Late Jurassic (Oxfordian) of China. However some authors have considered &quot;Juramaia&quot; as a stem therian instead, and some sources have doubted the dating of the specimen.

==Characteristics== 

Distinguishing features are:
*an enlarged malleolus (&quot;little hammer&quot;) at the bottom of the tibia, the larger of the two shin bones
*the joint between the first metatarsal bone and the entocuneiform bone (the innermost of the three cuneiform bones) in the foot is offset farther back than the joint between the second metatarsal and middle cuneiform bones—in metatherians these joints are level with each other
*various features of jaws and teeth including: having three molars in the halves of each jaw, each upper canine having two roots, the paraconid on the last lower premolar is pronounced, the talonid region of the lower molars is narrower than the trigonid.

==Taxonomy==

Eutheria (i.e. Placentalia &quot;sensu lato&quot;, Pan-Placentalia):
*incertae sedis:
** ?Family †Holoclemensiidae (often considered a basal metatherian)
** ?Genus †&quot;Hyotheridium&quot;
** ?Genus †&quot;Endotherium&quot;
** Genus †&quot;Durlstodon&quot;
** Genus †&quot;Durlstotherium&quot;
** Genus †&quot;Microtherulum&quot; 
** Genus †&quot;Sinodelphys&quot; 
** Genus †&quot;Cokotherium&quot; 
** Genus †&quot;Ambolestes&quot;
** Genus †&quot;Montanalestes&quot;
** Genus †&quot;Indoclemensia&quot;
** ?Family †Horolodectidae (might belong somewhere within Placentalia &quot;sensu stricto&quot;)
** ?Genus †&quot;Juramaia&quot;
** Genus †&quot;Eomaia&quot;
* Genus †&quot;Acristatherium&quot;
* &quot;Clade&quot; †Tamirtheria ? (monophyly disputed)
** Genus †&quot;Prokennalestes&quot;
** ?Genus †&quot;Hovurlestes&quot;
** Genus †&quot;Murtoilestes&quot;
** Genus †&quot;Bobolestes&quot; (inclusive of the former genus &quot;Otlestes&quot;)
** Family †Adapisoriculidae (inclusive of the genus †&quot;Sahnitherium&quot;)
** Genus †&quot;Paranyctoides&quot;
** Family †Zhelestidae (inclusive of the genus &quot;Eozhelestes&quot;)
** Family †Cimolestidae (inclusive of the genera †&quot;Maelestes&quot; and †&quot;Batodon&quot;)
** Order †Asioryctitheria 
** Family †Zalambdalestidae
** Order †Leptictida
**?Order †Taeniodonta
** ?Family †Didymoconidae
* ?Genus †&quot;Purgatorius&quot;
* ?Genus †&quot;Protungulatum&quot;
* ?Genus †&quot;Oxyprimus&quot;
* Infraclass Placentalia &quot;sensu stricto&quot;
Notes:
* Some older systems contained an order called Cimolesta (&quot;sensu lato&quot;), which contains the above taxa Cimolestidae, Taeniodonta and Didymoconidae, but also (all or some of) the taxa †Ptolemaiidae, †Palaeoryctidae, †Wyolestidae, †Pantolesta (probably inclusive of the family †Horolodectidae), †Tillodontia, †Apatotheria, †Pantodonta, Pholidota and †Palaeanodonta. Those additional taxa (all of which are usually considered members of Placentalia &quot;sensu stricto&quot; today) were thus also placed among basal Eutheria in such older systems and were placed next to Cimolestidae.
* Some systems also included the †Creodonta and/or †Dinocerata as basal Eutherians. 
* Some authors classify the taxa, which are at the end of the above system of basal Eutheria, as part of Placentalia &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. More specifically, depending on the author, this applies to the taxa of the above system that are placed from (and inclusive of) Leptictida or Asioryctitheria or Adapisoriculidae down to (and inclusive of) &quot;Oxyprimus&quot;.

==Evolutionary history==
Eutheria contains several extinct genera as well as larger groups, many with complicated taxonomic histories still not fully understood. Members of the Adapisoriculidae, Cimolesta and Leptictida have been previously placed within the outdated placental group Insectivora, while zhelestids have been considered primitive ungulates. However, more recent studies have suggested these enigmatic taxa represent stem group eutherians, more basal to Placentalia.

The weakly favoured cladogram favours Boreoeutheria as a basal eutherian clade as sister to the Atlantogenata.
 
Phylogeny after Wang &amp; Wang, 2023.
Below is a phylogeny from Gheerbrant &amp; Teodori (2021): 
== Ecology ==
Many non-placental eutherians are thought to have been insectivores, as is the case with many primitive mammals. However, the zhelestids are thought to have been herbivorous. Body size of eutherians was generally small during the Cretaceous period, but the range of body sizes increased dramatically after the K-Pg extinction, predominantly among placentals.

<text>In criminal law, diminished responsibility (or diminished capacity) is a potential defense by excuse by which defendants argue that although they broke the law, they should not be held fully criminally liable for doing so, as their mental functions were &quot;diminished&quot; or impaired.

==Overview==
Diminished capacity is a partial defense to charges that require that the defendant act with a particular state of mind. For example, if the felony murder rule does not apply, first degree murder requires that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with premeditation, deliberation, and the specific intent to kill—all three are necessary elements of the state&#x27;s case. If evidence exists, sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant because of mental illness or &quot;defect&quot; possessed the capacity to premeditate, deliberate or form the specific intent to kill then the state cannot convict the defendant of first degree murder. This does not mean that the defendant is entitled to an acquittal. The defendant still might be convicted of second-degree murder which only requires that the defendant act with general malice.

The defense&#x27;s acceptance in American jurisdictions varies considerably. The majority of states have adopted it by statute or case decision, and a minority even recognise broader defenses such as &quot;irresistible impulse&quot;. Some U.S. states restrict the defense to the charge of murder only where a successful defense will result in a manslaughter conviction instead of murder. Until recently, the Republic of Ireland did not accept the partial defense. The Irish Supreme Court had rejected the existence of the defense in &quot;DPP v O&#x27;Mahony&quot;. The case was abrogated, however, by enactment of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, effective June 1, 2006. The act, in pertinent part, specifically adopted the partial defense for the charge of murder where a successful defense will result in a manslaughter conviction instead of murder.

The defense is to be contrasted with insanity which is a complete but affirmative defense. In most jurisdictions a defendant would be acquitted on the grounds of insanity if the defendant established to the satisfaction of the jury that he suffered from such a mental disease or defect that he was unable to appreciate the consequences of his actions or did not know what he was doing was wrong. As noted a successful insanity defense will result in acquittal although a number of jurisdictions have adopted the guilty but insane verdict. The defense of insanity and diminished capacity although clearly distinct are not inconsistent defenses and both may be at issue in the same case. The critical distinctions are that diminished capacity is a partial, negating defense (negates an element of the state&#x27;s case) with the burden on the state to show that the defendant acted with the requisite state of mind while insanity is a complete but affirmative defense—the defendant bearing the burden of proving that he was legally insane.

This is an aspect of a more general insanity defense (see the M&#x27;Naghten rules). The defense &quot;was first recognized by Scottish common law to reduce the punishment of the ″&quot;partially insane&quot;″.&quot; It developed from the practice of juries in the 19th century of returning verdicts of guilty with a recommendation as to mercy or mitigation of sentence to reflect any extenuating circumstances. In a series of decisions, given mainly by Lord Deas, a doctrine grew that various types of mental weakness could have the effect of reducing what would otherwise be a conviction for murder (which attracted capital punishment) to one for culpable homicide (where the courts had greater discretion in sentencing). An example of a &quot;diminished capacity&quot; might be extremely low intelligence. In the English case of &quot;R v Raven&quot;, a man who had a physical age of 22 years but a mental age of only 9 years felt provoked by homosexual advances and killed his perceived attacker. His mental deficiency was not in dispute and, since a child of 9 years would not have been criminally responsible (see s50 Children and Young Persons Act 1933), and his mental responsibility for his acts was substantially impaired, manslaughter was the only realistic verdict. The rationale of the defense is that, as a precondition to punishment, the criminal law requires conduct to be voluntary. If something interferes with the capacity of the individual to choose to break the law, this should be reflected by an excuse or exculpation. The law should balance the need to be fair to the individual wrongdoer, but equally offer some protection to society from a person who may not have complete control over their behavior.

The effect of the defense varies between the jurisdictions and depends on the offence charged. In some cases, it will result in full excuse and therefore produce a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;. In others, it offers only exculpation to a degree, resulting in the substitution of a lesser offence (e.g., manslaughter instead of murder) or a mitigated sentence.

==English law==

Section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 states: 

==Scottish law==
Although the term is not used during the proceedings, the 1795 trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the murder of his brother Sir Francis Kinloch, 6th baronet of Gilmerton under Robert McQueen, Lord Braxfield is one of the earliest clear examples of recognition of diminished responsibility. Whilst found guilty, and usually expecting a death sentence, not only was Kinloch sentenced to life imprisonment instead, but two days after the judgement (17 July 1795) the accused was released into the care of a doctor (William Farquharson) on the understanding that Kinloch be kept in a secure environment (the doctor&#x27;s own house).

During the course of the 20th century the courts began to limit the mental conditions falling within diminished responsibility. In &quot;HM Advocate v Savage&quot; Lord Alness addressed the jury (at 51):

It is very difficult to put it in a phrase, but it has been put in this way: that there must be aberration or weakness of mind; that there must be some form of mental unsoundness; that there must be a state of mind which is bordering on, though not amounting to, insanity; that there must be a mind so affected that responsibility is diminished from full responsibility to partial responsibility. In other words, the prisoner in question must be only partially accountable for his actions. And I think one can see running through the cases that there is implied ... that there must be some form of mental disease.

This statement became the authoritative version of the test for diminished responsibility and the various factors mentioned by Lord Alness were regarded as being cumulative in nature. The effect was that the test became difficult to satisfy, and the courts adopted the position that the scope of the plea was not to be further widened (e.g. &quot;Carraher v HM Advocate&quot;) held that the plea was not available to a person suffering from psychopathic personality. But in &quot;Galbraith v HM Advocate&quot; it was held that the formula in &quot;Savage&quot; was not to be read in a narrow sense, and it was not necessary that all the criteria in that formula had to be present. Furthermore, although the plea had to be based on some form of mental abnormality, that condition need not be one bordering on insanity. Instead the court ruled that diminished responsibility required the existence of an abnormality of mind which had the effect that the accused&#x27;s ability to determine or control his actings was substantially impaired. However, the Court excluded from the scope of the plea:
#any condition brought on by the consumption of drink or drugs, and
#psychopathic personality disorder.

The Scottish Law Commission reported in 2004 proposing changes to the law on insanity and diminished responsibility.

==Australia==
At present, diminished responsibility exists as a statutory partial defence in most Australian jurisdictions. The defence is only available in cases of murder and serves to reduce the offence to manslaughter. In Australia it has been the subject of sentencing concerns specifically in relation to the weight attributed to protection of the community when sentencing offenders found guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility

In NSW, the partial defence of &#x27;diminished responsibility&#x27; was replaced by the partial defence of &quot;substantial impairment&quot; in 1998. The burden is on the defendant to prove the defence, on the balance of probabilities. There are three conditions that the defendant must prove. The first is the defendant must be suffering from an abnormality of the mind at the time of the acts/omissions causing death; see also the case of Byrne for the definition of &#x27;abnormality of the mind&#x27;. Second, the abnormality must be the result of an underlying condition. Third, the impairment must be so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.

==India==
Supreme Court of India bench headed by Justice Gogoi in a review petition upheld the principle of Diminished responsibility in the 2000 Dharmapuri bus burning and commuted to life imprisonment the death penalty given by the Salem district court and upheld by the Madras High Court and by another Supreme Court bench to three AIADMK party activists who had a set on fire a fully occupied bus with 44 girls and 2 lecturers of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University on an educational tour to protest Jayalalithaa&#x27;s conviction in Pleasant Stay hotel case in this three college girls were burnt alive and 16 college girls suffered burn injuries were acting on mob frenzy and setting a legal precedent.

==United States==
===Federal law===
The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines provide, &quot;A downward departure may be warranted if (1) the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity; and (2) the significantly reduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the commission of the offense.&quot;

===State law===
California was the first state in the U.S. to adopt the diminished capacity defense, beginning with &quot;People v. Wells&quot; and &quot;People v. Gorshen&quot;. The doctrine would soon be abolished by ballot initiative in 1982 following the negative publicity surrounding the case of Dan White, who had killed George Moscone and Harvey Milk. While White&#x27;s defense team did argue successfully for a ruling of diminished capacity, resulting in a verdict of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder, an urban legend that the defense had blamed White&#x27;s actions on the ingestion of sugar and junk food (the so-called &quot;Twinkie defense&quot;) sprang up out of inaccurate media coverage. One participant in the debate over diminished capacity rulings waved a Twinkie in the air to make his point. Currently, the &quot;California Penal Code&quot; states (2002), &quot;The defense of diminished capacity is hereby abolished ... there shall be no defense of diminished capacity, diminished responsibility, or irresistible impulse...&quot;

<text>In criminal law, irresistible impulse is a defense by excuse, in this case some sort of insanity, in which the defendant argues that they should not be held criminally liable for their actions that broke the law, because they could not control those actions, even if they knew them to be wrong. It was added to the M&#x27;Naghten rule as a basis for acquittal in the mid 20th century.

In 1994, Lorena Bobbitt was found not guilty when her defense argued that an irresistible impulse led her to cut off her husband&#x27;s penis.

The &quot;Penal Code&quot; of the U.S. state of California states (2002), &quot;The defense of diminished capacity is hereby abolished ... there shall be no defense of ... diminished responsibility or irresistible impulse...&quot;

The &quot;policeman at the elbow&quot; test is a test used by some courts to determine whether the defendant was insane when they committed a crime. It is a variant of the M&#x27;Naghten Rules that addresses the situation in which the defendant knew that what they were going to do was wrong, but had no ability to restrain themself from doing it. The test asks whether they would have done what they did even if a police officer were standing at their elbow, hence its name.

==Irresistible impulse in English law==
In English law the concept of &quot;irresistible impulse&quot; was developed in the 1960 case &quot;R v. Byrne&quot;. The appellant (described as a violent sexual psychopath) strangled then mutilated a young woman; it was alleged that Byrne suffered from violent and perverted sexual desires which he found impossible to control. Lord Parker C.J. broadened the definition of &quot;abnormality of mind&quot; to include those lacking &quot;the ability to exercise will-power to control acts in accordance with [their] rational judgment&quot;.

&quot;Irresistible impulse&quot; can be pleaded only under the defense of diminished responsibility, not under the defense of insanity. Thus it operates only as a partial defence to murder, reducing the charge to manslaughter, and giving the judge discretion as to length of sentence and whether committal would be more appropriate than incarceration.

<text>In jurisprudence, procedural defenses are forms of defense challenging the legitimacy of the legal proceeding. A party argues that it should not be held liable for a legal charge or claim brought against them by some legal process, because it has been found such a process is illegitimate. Procedural defenses are built into legal systems as incentives for systems to follow their own rules. In common law jurisdictions, the term has applications in both criminal law and civil law. Procedural defenses do not settle questions of guilt or innocence in a criminal proceeding, and are independent of substantive findings for or against a plaintiff or defendant in a civil proceeding. As an example, defendants might claim there is something about the method of bringing them to be judged that is unable to result in justice done to someone in their situation. They might claim the process is incompatible with the goals of the justice system. 

In the United States, procedural defenses include: 
* collateral estoppel
* denial of a speedy trial
* double jeopardy
* entrapment
* prosecutorial misconduct
* selective prosecution
* exclusionary rule
* facts found by judge rather than jury
* denial or neglect of public counsel appointment
* no opportunity to impugn witnesses against you
* breaches of due process, such as precedent established in &quot;Rhode Island v. Innis&quot; (1980) or &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; (1966)
* denial of a jury trial in a civil case
Traditional procedural defenses in &quot;equity&quot; in the U.S. and other common law jurisdictions:
* laches
* estoppel

<text>The Oghuz Turks (Middle Turkic: , ) were a western Turkic people who spoke the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family. In the 8th century, they formed a tribal confederation conventionally named the Oghuz Yabgu State in Central Asia. Today, much of the populations of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are descendants of Oghuz Turks. The term Oghuz was gradually supplanted by the terms Turkmen and Turcoman ( or &quot;Türkmân&quot;) by 13th century. 

The Oghuz confederation migrated westward from the Jeti-su area after a conflict with the Karluk allies of the Uyghurs. In the 9th century, the Oghuz from the Aral steppes drove Pechenegs westward from the Emba and Ural River region. In the 10th century, the Oghuz inhabited the steppe of the rivers Sari-su, Turgai and Emba north of Lake Balkhash in modern-day Kazakhstan. 

They embraced Islam and adapted their traditions and institutions to the Islamic world, emerging as empire-builders with a constructive sense of statecraft. In the 11th century, the Seljuk Oghuz clan entered Persia, where they founded the Great Seljuk Empire. The same century, a Tengriist Oghuz clan, also known as &quot;Uzes&quot; or &quot;Torks&quot;, overthrew Pecheneg supremacy in the frontier of the Russian steppes; those who settled along the frontier were gradually Slavicized; the almost feudal &quot;Black Hat&quot; principality grew with its own military aristocracy. Others, harried by the Kipchak Turks, crossed the lower Danube and invaded the Balkans, where they were stopped by a plague and became mercenaries for the Byzantine imperial forces (1065). Oghuz warriors served in almost all Islamic armies of the Middle East from the 1000s onwards, and as far as Spain and Morocco. 
In the late 13th century after the fall of the Seljuks, the Ottoman dynasty gradually conquered Anatolia with an army also predominantly of Oghuz, besting other local Oghuz Turkish states. In legend, the founder Osman&#x27;s genealogy traces to Oghuz Khagan, the legendary ancient ancestor of Turkic people, giving the Ottoman sultans primacy among Turkish monarchs. The dynasties of Khwarazmians, Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu,
Ottomans, Afsharids and Qajars are also believed to descend from the Oghuz-Turkmen tribes of Begdili, Yiva, Bayandur, Kayi and Afshar respectively.

== Name and language ==
The name &quot;Oghuz&quot; is a Common Turkic word for &quot;tribe&quot;. By the 10th century, Islamic sources were calling them Muslim Turkmens, as opposed to those of Tengrist or Buddhist religion; and by the 12th century this term was adopted into Byzantine usage, as the Oghuzes were overwhelmingly Muslim. The name &quot;Oghuz&quot; fell out of use by 13th century.

Linguistically, the Oghuz belong to the Common Turkic speaking group, characterized by sound correspondences such as Common Turkic versus Oghuric and Common Turkic versus Oghuric . Within the Common Turkic group, the Oghuz languages share these innovations: loss of Proto-Turkic gutturals in suffix anlaut, loss of except after , becoming either or lost, voicing of to and of to , and becomes .

Their language belongs to the Oghuz group of the Turkic languages family. Kara-Khanid scholar Mahmud al-Kashgari wrote that of all the Turkic languages, that of the Oghuz was the simplest. He also observed that long separation had led to clear differences between the western Oghuz and Kipchak language and that of the eastern Turks. Byzantine sources call Oghuz Turks Uzes (, ).

==Origins==

According to historians and linguists, the Proto-Turkic language originated in Central-East Asia, potentially in Altai-Sayan region, Mongolia or Tuva. Initially, Proto-Turkic speakers were potentially both hunter-gatherers and farmers, but later became nomadic pastoralists. Early and medieval Turkic groups exhibited a wide range of both East Asian and West-Eurasian physical appearances and genetic origins, in part through long-term contact with neighboring peoples such as Iranian, Mongolic, Tocharian, Uralic and Yeniseian peoples, and others.

In early times, they practiced a Tengrist religion, erecting many carved wooden funerary statues surrounded by simple stone &quot;balbal&quot; monoliths and holding elaborate hunting and banqueting rituals.
During the 2nd century BC, according to ancient Chinese sources, a steppe tribal confederation known as the Xiongnu and their allies, the Wusun (probably an Indo-European people) defeated the neighboring Indo-European-speaking Yuezhi and drove them out of western China and into Central Asia. Various scholarly theories link the Xiongnu to Turkic peoples and/or the Huns. Bichurin claimed that the first usage of the word &quot;Oghuz&quot; appears to have been the title of &quot;Oğuz Kağan&quot;, whose biography shares similarities with the account, recorded by Han Chinese, of Xiongnu leader Modu Shanyu (or Mau-Tun), who founded the Xiongnu Empire. However, Oghuz Khan narratives were actually collected in Compendium of Chronicles by Ilkhanid scholar Rashid-al-Din in the early 14th century.

Sima Qian recorded the name &quot;Wūjiē&quot; 烏揭 (LHC: *&quot;ʔɔ-gɨat&quot;) or &quot;Hūjiē&quot; 呼揭 (LHC: *&quot;xɔ-gɨat&quot;), of a people hostile to the Xiongnu and living immediately west of them, in the area of the Irtysh River, near Lake Zaysan. Golden suggests that these might be Chinese renditions of &quot;*Ogur&quot; ~ &quot;*Oguz&quot;, yet uncertainty remains. According to one theory, &quot;Hūjiē&quot; is just another transliteration of &quot;Yuezhi&quot; and may refer to the Turkic Uyghurs; however, this is controversial and has few scholarly adherents.

Yury Zuev (1960) links the Oghuz to the Western Turkic tribe 姑蘇 &quot;Gūsū&quot; &lt; (MC *&quot;kuo-suo&quot;) in the 8th-century encyclopaedia Tongdian (or erroneously &quot;Shǐsū&quot; 始蘇 in the 11th century Zizhi Tongjian). Zuev also noted a parallel between two passages: 
*one from the 8th-century Taibo Yinjing (太白陰經) &quot;Venus&#x27;s Secret Classic&quot; by Li Quan (李筌) which mentioned the 三窟 ~ 三屈 &quot;Three &quot;Qu&quot;&quot; (&lt; MC *&quot;k(h)ɨut̚&quot;) after the 十箭 &quot;Shí Jiàn&quot; &quot;Ten Arrows&quot; (OTrk 𐰆𐰣:𐰸 &quot;On Oq&quot;) and &quot;Jĭu Xìng&quot; &quot;Nine Surnames&quot; (OTrk 𐱃𐰸𐰆𐰔:𐰆𐰍𐰔 &quot;Toquz Oğuz&quot;); and 
*another from al-Maṣudi&#x27;s Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems, which mentioned the three hordes of the Turkic &quot;Ġuz&quot; 
Based on those sources, Zuev proposes that in the 8th century the Oghuzes were located outsides of the Ten Arrows&#x27; jurisdiction, west of the Altai Mountains, near lake Issyk-Kul, Talas river&#x27;s basin and seemingly around the Syr Darya basin, and near the Chumul, Karluks, Qays, Quns, &quot;Śari&quot;, etc. who were mentioned by al-Maṣudi and Sharaf al-Zaman al-Marwazi.

According to Ahmad ibn Fadlan, the Oghuz were nomads, but also had cultivated crops, and the economy was based on a semi-pastoralist lifestyle.

Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos mentioned the &quot;Uzi&quot; and &quot;Mazari&quot; (Hungarians) as neighbours of the Pechenegs.

By the time of the Orkhon inscriptions (8th century AD) &quot;Oghuz&quot; was being applied generically to all inhabitants of the Göktürk Khaganate. Within the khaganate, the Oghuz community gradually expanded, incorporating other tribes. A number of subsequent tribal confederations bore the name Oghuz, often affixed to a numeral indicating the number of united tribes. These include references to the simple &quot;Oguz&quot;, &quot;Üch-Oghuz&quot; (&quot;three Oghuz&quot;), &quot;Altï Oghuz&quot; (&quot;six Oghuz&quot;), possibly the &quot;Otuz Oghuz&quot; (&quot;thirty Oghuz&quot;), &quot;Sekiz-Oghuz&quot; (&quot;eight Oghuz&quot;), and the &quot;Tokuz-Oghuz&quot; (&quot;nine Oghuz&quot;), who originally occupied different areas in the vicinity of the Altai Mountains. Golden (2011) states Transoxanian Oghuz Turks who founded the Oghuz Yabgu State were not the same tribal confederation as the Toquz Oghuz from whom emerged the founders of Uyghur Khaganate. Istakhri and Muhammad ibn Muhmad al-Tusi kept the Toquz Oghuz and Oghuz distinct and Ibn al-Faqih mentioned: &quot;the infidel Turk-Oghuz, the Toquz-Oghuz, and the Qarluq&quot; Even so, Golden notes the confusion in Latter Göktürks&#x27; and Uyghurs&#x27; inscriptions, where Oghuz apparently referred to Toquz Oghuz or another tribal grouping, who were also named Oghuz without a prefixed numeral; this confusion is also reflected in Sharaf al-Zaman al-Marwazi, who listed 12 Oghuz tribes, who were ruled by a &quot;Toquz Khaqan&quot; and some of whom were Toquz-Oghuz, on the border of Transoxiana and Khwarazm. At most, the Oghuz were possibly led by a core group of Toquz Oghuz clans or tribes.

Noting that the mid-8th-century Tariat inscriptions, in Uyghur khagan Bayanchur&#x27;s honor, mentioned the rebellious Igdir tribe who had revolted against him, Klyashtorny considers this as one piece of &quot;direct evidence in favour of the existence of kindred relations between the Tokuz Oguzs of Mongolia, The Guzs of the Aral region, and modern Turkmens&quot;, besides the facts that Kashgari mentioned the Igdir as the 14th of 22 Oghuz tribes; and that Igdirs constitute part of the Turkmen tribe Chowdur. The Shine Usu inscription, also in Bayanchur&#x27;s honor, mentioned the Nine-Oghuzes as &quot;[his] people&quot; and that he defeated the Eight-Oghuzes and their allies, the Nine Tatars, three times in 749.; according to Klyashtorny and Czeglédy, eight tribes of the Nine-Oghuzes revolted against the leading Uyghur tribe and renamed themselves Eight-Oghuzes.

Ibn al-Athir, an Arab historian, claimed that the Oghuz Turks were settled mainly in Transoxiana, between the Caspian and Aral Seas, during the period of the caliph Al-Mahdi (after 775 AD). By 780, the eastern parts of the Syr Darya were ruled by the Karluk Turks and to their west were the Oghuz. Transoxiana, their main homeland in subsequent centuries became known as the &quot;Oghuz Steppe&quot;.

During the period of the Abbasid caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun (813–833), the name Oghuz starts to appear in the works of Islamic writers. The &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;, a historical epic of the Oghuz, contains historical echoes of the 9th and 10th centuries but was likely written several centuries later.

==Physical appearance==

Al-Masudi described Yangikent&#x27;s Oghuz Turks as &quot;distinguished from other Turks by their valour, their slanted eyes, and the smallness of their stature&quot;. Stone heads of Seljuq elites kept at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art displayed East Asian features. Over time, Oghuz Turks&#x27; physical appearance changed. Rashid al-Din Hamadani stated that &quot;because of the climate their features gradually changed into those of Tajiks. Since they were not Tajiks, the Tajik peoples called them turkmān, i.e. Turk-like (Turk-mānand)&quot;. Ḥāfiẓ Tanīsh Mīr Muḥammad Bukhārī also related that the &quot;Oghuz Turkic face did not remain as it was after their migration into Transoxiana and Iran&quot;. Khiva khan, Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur, in his Chagatai-language treatise Genealogy of the Turkmens, wrote that &quot;their (Oghuz Turks) chin started to become narrow, their eyes started to become large, their faces started to become small, and their noses started to become big after five or six generations&quot;. Ottoman historian Mustafa Âlî commented in &quot;Künhüʾl-aḫbār&quot; that Anatolian Turks and Ottoman elites are ethnically mixed: &quot;Most of the inhabitants of Rûm are of confused ethnic origin. Among its notables there are few whose lineage does not go back to a convert to Islam.&quot;

==Social units==
The militarism that the Oghuz empires were very well known for was rooted in their centuries-long nomadic lifestyle. In general, they were a herding society which possessed certain military advantages that sedentary societies did not have, particularly mobility. Alliances by marriage and kinship, and systems of &quot;social distance&quot; based on family relationships were the connective tissues of their society.

In Oghuz traditions, &quot;society was simply the result of the growth of individual families&quot;. But such a society also grew by alliances and the expansion of different groups, normally through marriages. The shelter of the Oghuz tribes was a tent-like dwelling, erected on wooden poles and covered with skin, felt, or hand-woven textiles, which is called a &quot;yurt&quot;.

Their cuisine included yahni (stew), kebabs, Toyga soup (meaning &quot;wedding soup&quot;), Kımız (a traditional drink of the Turks, made from fermented horse milk), Pekmez (a syrup made of boiled grape juice) and helva made with wheat starch or rice flour, tutmac (noodle soup), yufka (flattened bread), katmer (layered pastry), chorek (ring-shaped buns), bread, clotted cream, cheese, yogurt, milk and ayran (diluted yogurt beverage), as well as wine.

Social order was maintained by emphasizing &quot;correctness in conduct as well as ritual and ceremony&quot;. Ceremonies brought together the scattered members of the society to celebrate birth, puberty, marriage, and death. Such ceremonies had the effect of minimizing social dangers and also of adjusting persons to each other under controlled emotional conditions.

Patrilineally related men and their families were regarded as a group with rights over a particular territory and were distinguished from neighbours on a territorial basis. Marriages were often arranged among territorial groups so that neighbouring groups could become related, but this was the only organizing principle that extended territorial unity. Each community of the Oghuz Turks was thought of as part of a larger society composed of distant as well as close relatives. This signified &quot;tribal allegiance&quot;. Wealth and materialistic objects were not commonly emphasized in Oghuz society and most remained herders, and when settled they would be active in agriculture.

Status within the family was based on age, gender, relationships by blood, or marriageability. Males, as well as females, were active in society, yet men were the backbones of leadership and organization. According to the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;, which demonstrates the culture of the Oghuz Turks, women were &quot;expert horse riders, archers, and athletes&quot;. The elders were respected as repositories of both &quot;secular and spiritual wisdom&quot;.

==Homeland in Central Asia==
In the 700s, the Oghuz Turks made a new home and domain for themselves in the area between the Caspian and Aral seas and the northwest part of Transoxania, along the Syr Darya river. They had moved westward from the Altay mountains passing through the Siberian steppes and settled in this region, and also penetrated into southern Russia and the Volga from their bases in west China. In the 11th century, the Oghuz Turks adopted Arabic script, replacing the Old Turkic alphabet.

In his accredited 11th-century treatise titled &quot;Diwan Lughat al-Turk&quot;, Karakhanid scholar Mahmud of Kashgar mentioned five Oghuz cities named &quot;Sabran&quot;, &quot;Sitkün&quot;, &quot;Qarnaq&quot;, &quot;Suğnaq&quot;, and &quot;Qaraçuq&quot; (the last of which was also known to Kashgari as Farab, now Otrar; situated near the Karachuk mountains to its east). The extension from the Karachuk Mountains towards the Caspian Sea was called the &quot;Oghuz Steppe Lands&quot; from where the Oghuz Turks established trading, religious and cultural contacts with the Abbasid Arab caliphate who ruled to the south. This is around the same time that they first converted to Islam and renounced their Tengriism belief system. The Arab historians mentioned that the Oghuz Turks were ruled by a number of kings and chieftains.

It was in this area that they later founded the Seljuk Empire, and it was from this area that they spread west into western Asia and eastern Europe during Turkic migrations from the 9th until the 12th century. The founders of the Ottoman Empire were also Oghuz Turks.

==Poetry and literature==

Oghuz Turkish literature includes the famous &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot; which was UNESCO&#x27;s 2000 literary work of the year, as well as the &quot;Oghuzname&quot;, Battalname, Danishmendname, &quot;Köroğlu&quot; epics which are part of the literary history of Azerbaijanis, Turks of Turkey and Turkmens. The modern and classical literature of Azerbaijan, Turkey and Turkmenistan are also considered Oghuz literature since it was produced by their descendants.

The Book of Dede Korkut is a valuable collection of epics and stories, bearing witness to the language, the way of life, religions, traditions, and social norms of the Oghuz Turks in Azerbaijan, Turkey, Iran (West Azerbaijan, Golestan) and parts of Central Asia including Turkmenistan.

== Oghuz and Yörüks ==


Yörüks are an Oghuz ethnic group, some of whom are still semi-nomadic, primarily inhabiting the mountains of Anatolia and partly Balkan peninsula. Their name derives from the verb from Chagatai language, yörü- &quot;yörümek&quot; (to walk), but Western Turkic yürü- (yürümek in infinitive), which means &quot;to walk&quot;, with the word Yörük or Yürük designating &quot;those who walk, walkers&quot;.

The Yörük to this day appear as a distinct segment of the population of Macedonia and Thrace where they settled as early as the 14th century. While today the Yörük are increasingly settled, many of them still maintain their nomadic lifestyle, breeding goats and sheep in the Taurus Mountains and further eastern parts of mediterranean regions (in southern Anatolia), in the Pindus (Epirus, Greece), the Šar Mountains (North Macedonia), the Pirin and Rhodope Mountains (Bulgaria) and Dobrudja. An earlier offshoot of the Yörüks, the Kailars or Kayılar Turks were amongst the first Turkish colonists in Europe, (&quot;Kailar&quot; or &quot;Kayılar&quot; being the Turkish name for the Greek town of Ptolemaida which took its current name in 1928) formerly inhabiting parts of the Greek regions of Thessaly and Macedonia. Settled Yörüks could be found until 1923, especially near and in the town of Kozani.

==Traditional tribal organization==
Mahmud al-Kashgari listed 22 Oghuz tribes in Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk. Kashgari further wrote that &quot;In origin they are 24 tribes, but the two Khalajiyya tribes are distinguished from them [the twenty-two] in certain respects and so are not counted among them. This is the origin&quot;.

Later, Charuklug from Kashgari&#x27;s list would be omitted. Rashid-al-Din and Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur added three more: Kïzïk, Karkïn, and Yaparlï, to the list in Jami&#x27; al-tawarikh (Compendium of Chronicles) and Shajare-i Türk (Genealogy of the Turks), respectively. According to Selçukname, Oghuz Khagan had 6 children (Sun – Gün, Moon – Ay, Star – Yıldız, Sky – Gök, Mountain – Dağ, Sea – Diŋiz), and all six would become Khans themselves, each leading four tribes.

<text>Wallace Hume Carothers (; April 27, 1896 – April 29, 1937) was an American chemist, inventor, and the leader of organic chemistry at DuPont, who was credited with the invention of nylon.

Carothers was a group leader at the DuPont Experimental Station laboratory, near Wilmington, Delaware, where most polymer research was done. Carothers was an organic chemist who, in addition to first developing nylon, also helped lay the groundwork for neoprene. After receiving his Ph.D., he taught at several universities before he was hired by DuPont to work on fundamental research.

He married Helen Sweetman on February 21, 1936. Carothers had been troubled by periods of depression since his youth. Despite his success with nylon, he felt that he had not accomplished much and had run out of ideas. His unhappiness was exacerbated by the death of his sister, and on April 28, 1937, he committed suicide by drinking potassium cyanide. His daughter, Jane, was born on November 27, 1937.

==Education and academic career==
Carothers was born on April 27, 1896, in Burlington, Iowa, to Ira and Mary Evalina Carothers. He was the oldest of four children. He had one brother and two sisters: John, Isobel and Elizabeth. As a youth, Carothers was fascinated by tools and mechanical devices and spent many hours experimenting. He attended public school in Des Moines, Iowa, where he was known as a conscientious student. After graduation, and under pressure from his father, Carothers enrolled in the Capital City Commercial College in Des Moines, where his father was vice-president, completing the accountancy and secretarial curriculum in July 1915.

In September 1915, he entered Tarkio College in Missouri. Although he initially majored in English, he switched to chemistry under the influence of Arthur Pardee, head of that department. Carothers so excelled in chemistry that before graduation he was made a chemistry instructor and studied for as well as taught the senior course when Pardee left to become chairman of the chemistry department at the University of South Dakota. He graduated from Tarkio in 1920 at the age of 24 with a bachelor of science degree. Then he went to the University of Illinois for his master of arts degree, which he received in 1921 under the guidance of Professor Carl Marvel.

During the 1921–22 school year, Carothers held a one-year appointment as a chemistry instructor at the University of South Dakota. It was at the University of South Dakota that he began his independent research that resulted in an article accepted by the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot;. In this paper he measured physical properties of phenyl isocyanate and of diazobenzene-imide (now known as phenyl azide). The properties have very similar values, which led him to the conclusion that the structure of the second compound is C6H5-N=N=N, with the three nitrogen atoms in a linear chain rather than a ring as previously thought.

He went back to the University of Illinois to study for his Ph.D. under Roger Adams. His degree was awarded in 1924. He specialized in organic chemistry and minored in physical chemistry and mathematics. He worked as a research assistant during 1922–1923 and received the Carr Fellowship for 1923–24. This was the most prestigious award offered by the university at that time.

He was initiated into Alpha Chi Sigma in 1926 as a member of Zeta Chapter at the University of Illinois.

After receiving his Ph.D., Carothers stayed at the University of Illinois for two years as an instructor in organic chemistry.

In 1926, Carothers moved to Harvard University, where he was again an instructor in organic chemistry. Harvard president James B. Conanthimself a chemist wrote of Carothers:
In his research, Dr. Carothers showed even at this time the high degree of originality which marked his later work. He was never content to follow the beaten path or to accept the usual interpretations of organic reactions. His first thinking about polymerization and the structure of substances of high molecular weight began while he was at Harvard. 

In 1927, DuPont decided to fund fundamental, pure research: research not deliberately aimed at the development of a money-making product. Carothers traveled to Wilmington, Delaware, to discuss the possibility of being in charge of organic chemistry at the new DuPont laboratory for fundamental research.

==Move to DuPont==
The decision to leave academia was difficult for Carothers. At first he refused DuPont&#x27;s offer of employment, explaining that &quot;I suffer from neurotic spells of diminished capacity which might constitute a much more serious handicap there than here.&quot; In spite of this admission, a DuPont executive, Hamilton Bradshaw, traveled to Harvard and convinced Carothers to change his mind. His salary was $500 a month as compared with only $267 at Harvard ($3200 per year).

Later in a letter to Wilko Machetanz, his Tarkio roommate, Carothers expanded on his feelings of depression: &quot;I find myself, even now, accepting incalculable benefits proffered out of sheer magnanimity and good will and failing to make even such trivial return as circumstances permit and human feeling and decency demand, out of obtuseness or fear or selfishness or mere indifference and complete lack of feeling.&quot;

===Neoprene===
At Dupont Carothers was given a position in its new fundamental research program that was just recently established in Wilmington, Delaware and the company had allowed him to choose any research of his choice. He chose polymer research because the subject needed theoretic exploration and had immense commercial implications. Carothers began working at the DuPont Experimental Station on February 6, 1928. The synthesis of a polymer with a molecular weight of more than 4,200, the mass achieved by Dr. Emil Fischer, was his primary goal.

By the summer of 1928, Carothers had a small staff of Ph.D. chemists and two consultants: Dr. Roger Adams, his thesis advisor, and Dr. Carl Marvel, his instructor of organic chemistry at the University of Illinois. The laboratory where these top scientists worked became known as &quot;Purity Hall&quot;. It was discouraging that by the middle of 1929, &quot;Purity Hall&quot; had not produced a polymer with a weight of much over 4,000.

In January 1930, Dr. Elmer K. Bolton became assistant chemical director in the chemical department, and thus, Carothers&#x27; immediate boss. Bolton wanted practical results in 1930, and his wish was fulfilled. Bolton asked Carothers to examine the chemistry of an acetylene polymer with the goal of creating synthetic rubber. In April 1930, one of Carothers&#x27; staff, Dr. Arnold M. Collins, isolated chloroprene, a liquid which polymerized to produce a solid material that resembled rubber. This product was the first synthetic rubber and is known today as Neoprene.

===Polyesters===

In the same year, Dr. Julian W. Hill, another member of the Carothers team, began work again on attempting to produce a polyester with a molecular weight of above 4,000. His efforts were soon met with great success when he produced a synthetic polymer with a molecular weight of about 12,000. The high molecular weight allowed the melted polymer to be stretched out into strings of fiber. Thus was created the first synthetic silk, described by the chemists as a superpolyester.

Polyesters and polyamides are examples of condensation polymers formed by step-growth polymerization. Carothers worked out the theory of step-growth polymerization and derived the Carothers equation which relates the average degree of polymerization to the fractional conversion (or yield) of monomer into polymer. This equation shows that for a high molecular weight, a very high fractional conversion is needed (for step-growth polymers only).

Hill also produced a synthetic fiber that was elastic and strong by combining glycols and diacids and heating under reduced pressure, using a molecular still to remove the last traces of water produced in the condensation reaction. Unfortunately, the fiber produced could not be commercialized because it reverted to a sticky mass when placed in hot water. Carothers dropped his research on polymers for several years.

==Later career and depression==
In 1931, Carothers moved into a house in Wilmington, which became known as Whiskey Acres, with three other DuPont scientists. He was no recluse, but his depressive moods often prevented him from enjoying all the activities in which his roommates took part. In a letter to a close friend, Frances Spencer, he said, &quot;There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much to report concerning my experiences outside of chemistry. I&#x27;m living out in the country now with three other bachelors, and they being socially inclined have all gone out in tall hats and white ties, while I after my ancient custom sit sullenly at home.&quot; At about this time, Carothers showed Julian Hill that he kept a capsule of cyanide attached to his watch chain.

Carothers hated the public speaking that was necessary to maintain his high-profile. In a letter to Frances Spencer in January 1932, he related, &quot;I did go up to New Haven during the holidays and made a speech at the organic symposium. It was pretty well received but the prospect of having to make it ruined the preceding weeks and it was necessary to resort to considerable amounts of alcohol to quiet my nerves for the occasion. … My nervousness, moroseness and vacillation get worse as time goes on, and the frequent resort to drinking doesn&#x27;t bring about any permanent improvement. 1932 looks pretty black to me just now.&quot;

In 1932, the agreement under which Carothers was hired was modified by Dr. Bolton. &quot;Purity Hall&quot; would now focus on &quot;effecting a closer relationship between the ultimate objectives of our work and the interests of the company&quot;. This meant that funds were shifted from pure research to practical research. Carothers did not see himself as a skilled commercial researcher. He proposed that fundamental work be limited to two or three proposals, which would be consistent with DuPont&#x27;s interests.

Carothers&#x27; personal life during this time was busy. He was having an affair with a married woman, Sylvia Moore, who with her husband filed for divorce in 1933. Concomitantly he worried about the financial problems of his parents and planned to bring them to Wilmington. With no thought of the possible emotional ramifications of this move, he bought a house in Arden about from the Experimental Station and moved into it with his parents. He was 37 at the time. Interactions with his parents soon became tense. Carothers was still seeing Sylvia Moore, who was now single, and his parents greatly disapproved of the relationship. Finding the tension in the household too wearing, his parents returned to Des Moines in the spring of 1934.

===Polyamides===
In 1934, Carothers turned his attention to fibers again. Now the team substituted diamines for glycols to produce a type of polymer called a polyamide. These substances were much more stable than the polyesters formed by using the glycols. The ability of polyamides to form crystalline domains through hydrogen bonding gives them increased mechanical properties. Therefore, they might produce a synthetic silk that would be practical for everyday use. His research resulted in the invention of a number of new polyamides. The lab work for this project was conducted by Dr. W. R. Peterson and Dr. Donald Coffman. In 1935, Dr. Gerard Berchet was assigned to this polyamide research.

It was during this productive period of research, in the summer of 1934, before the eventual invention of nylon, that Carothers disappeared. He did not come into work, and no one knew where he was. He was found in a small psychiatric clinic, Pinel Clinic, near the famous Phipps Clinic associated with Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Apparently, he had become so depressed that he drove to Baltimore to consult a psychiatrist, who put him in the clinic.

===Nylon===
Shortly after his release from the clinic, Carothers returned to DuPont. Bolton instructed Carothers to work on polyamides.

Carother&#x27;s work in linear super-polymers began as an unrestricted foray into the unknown, with no practical objective in mind. But the research was in a new field in chemistry and Du Pont believed that any new chemical breakthrough would likely be of value to the company. In the course of research, Carothers obtained some super-polymers that became viscous solids at high temperatures, and the observation was made that filaments could be made from this material if a rod was dipped in the molten polymer and withdrawn. At this discovery, the focus of the project shifted to these filaments and &#x27;Nylon&#x27; was the result.

On February 28, 1935, Gerard Berchet, under the direction of Carothers, produced a half-ounce of polymer from hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid, creating polyamide 6-6, the substance that would come to be known as Nylon. It was difficult to work with because of its high melting point, but Bolton chose this polyamide as the one to develop commercially. He selected Dr. George Graves to work with Carothers on the project. Eventually, Graves supplanted Carothers as the leader of the polyamide project. In addition, dozens of chemists and engineers worked on refining polyamide 6-6 into a viable commercial product.

==Marriage and death==
On February 21, 1936, Carothers married Helen Sweetman, whom he had been dating since 1934. Sweetman had a bachelor&#x27;s degree with a major in chemistry and worked for DuPont on the preparation of patent applications. During his lifetime, his friends would often judge his marriage with Helen in comparison to his previous affair with Sylvia Moore, stating that they thought Moore was a greater woman.

Soon afterwards, on April 30, 1936, Carothers became the first industrial organic chemist to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences, a very high honor. Yet, by June 1936, in spite of this honor which validated his contributions to science, Carothers could not shake the depression that prevented him from working. In early June, he was involuntarily admitted to the Philadelphia Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, a prestigious mental hospital, under the care of psychiatrist Dr. Kenneth Appel. One month later, he was given permission to leave the institute to go hiking in the Tyrolean Alps with friends. The plan was for him to day hike with Dr. Roger Adams and Dr. John Flack for two weeks. After they left, he continued hiking by himself, without sending word to anyone, not even his wife. On September 14, he suddenly appeared at her desk at the Experimental Station. From that point on, Carothers was not expected to perform any real work at the Experimental Station. He would often go in and visit. He began living in Whiskey Acres again, after his wife had agreed with Dr. Appel that she was not strong enough to watch over Carothers.

On January 8, 1937, Carothers&#x27; sister Isobel died of pneumonia. Wallace and Helen Carothers traveled to Chicago to attend her funeral and then to Des Moines for her burial. He still traveled to Philadelphia to visit his psychiatrist, Dr. Appel, who told a friend of Carothers that he thought suicide was the likely outcome of Carothers&#x27; case.

On April 28, 1937, Carothers went to the Experimental Station to work. About 5pm the next day, he was found dead in his hotel room with a squeezed lemon and some cyanide salt nearby. No note was found.

He was posthumously inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame in 1982.

<doc id="216694" wikidata="Q1066302" url="?curid=216694" title="Entrapment">
<text>Entrapment is a practice in which a law enforcement agent or an agent of the state induces a person to commit a crime that the person would have otherwise been unlikely or unwilling to commit. In US law, it is defined as &quot;the conception and planning of an offense by an officer or agent, and the procurement of its commission by one who would not have perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the officer or state agent&quot;.

Police conduct rising to the level of entrapment is broadly discouraged and thus, in many jurisdictions, is available as a defense against criminal liability. Sting operations, through which police officers or agents engage in deception to try to catch persons who are committing crimes, raise concerns about possible entrapment.

Depending on the law in the jurisdiction, the prosecution may be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not entrapped or the defendant may be required to prove that they were entrapped as an affirmative defense.

In the practice of journalism and whistle-blowing &quot;entrapment&quot; means &quot;deceptive and trust-breaking techniques ... applied to trick someone to commit a legal or moral transgression.&quot;

==Etymology and usage==
The word entrapment, from the verb &quot;to &quot;, meaning to catch in a trap, was first used in this sense in 1899 in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit case of &quot;People v Braisted&quot;.

The 1828 edition of Noah Webster&#x27;s American Dictionary of the English Language defines entrap as:

== Canada ==
The Supreme Court of Canada developed the doctrine of entrapment in three major decisions: &quot;R. v. Amato&quot;, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 418, &quot;R. v. Mack&quot;, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, and &quot;R. v. Barnes&quot;, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449.

There are two different forms of entrapment in Canadian law.

# Random virtue testing: This form of entrapment occurs when the police offer an individual the opportunity to commit a crime without reasonable suspicion that either that individual or where that individual is located is associated with the criminal activity under investigation. If police have such a reasonable suspicion, they are still limited to providing only an opportunity to commit the offence.
# Inducement of an offence: This form of entrapment occurs when the police go beyond merely providing an opportunity to commit an offence but actually induce the commission of the offense. Some factors a court may consider when deciding whether police have induced the offence include the type of crime being investigated, whether an average person would have been induced, the persistence and number of attempts made by the police, the type of inducement used (fraud, deceit, reward, etc.), and the existence of express or implied threats.

The question of entrapment is considered only after there has been a finding of guilt. If, after finding the accused guilty, the court determines that the accused was entrapped, the court enters a judicial stay of proceedings. That is similar to an acquittal.

===History===

In 2013, a British Columbia couple were found guilty of attempting to blow up the British Columbia Parliament Buildings. In 2016, the verdict was overturned because the couple were found to have been entrapped into the plot by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

It was the first time entrapment had been successfully argued in a terrorism case. Three previous attempts failed.

== Germany ==
In German law, it is normally forbidden to induce or persuade someone to commit a crime or to attempt to do so. However, the German Federal Court of Justice has held that entrapment by undercover police agents is not a reason to stay the case &quot;&quot;. If undercover agents have been used without proper justification, punishment for the committed offense may be reduced.

In the case of persons who are not initially under suspicion and unlikely to commit a certain crime, a decision from 1999 stated that entrapment of such persons violates the right to a fair trial, and the punishment for the committed offense may thus be reduced.

== United Kingdom ==
=== England and Wales ===
The main authority on entrapment in England and Wales, held to be equally applicable in Scotland, is the decision of the House of Lords in &quot;R. v. Loosely&quot; (2001). A stay is granted if the conduct of the state was so seriously improper that the administration of justice was brought into disrepute. In deciding whether to grant a stay, the Court will consider, as a useful guide, whether the police did more than present the defendant with an unexceptional opportunity to commit a crime.

In &quot;Loosely&quot;, Lords Hoffman and Hutton indicated certain factors that should be considered in deciding whether proceedings against a defendant should be stayed:
* Whether the police acted in good faith;
* Whether the police had good reason to suspect the accused of criminal activities;
* Whether the police suspected that crime was particularly prevalent in the area in which the investigation took place (&quot;Williams v. DPP&quot;);
* Whether pro-active investigatory techniques were necessary because of the secrecy and difficulty of detection of the criminal activity in question;
* The defendant&#x27;s circumstances and vulnerability; and
* The nature of the offence.

It has been held that it is generally acceptable for the police to conduct test purchases (&quot;DPP v. Marshall&quot;) or pose as passengers to catch unlicensed taxi drivers (&quot;Nottingham City Council v. Amin&quot;).

Historically, entrapment was common in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and was used frequently by the Bank of England and Royal Mint to catch people involved in currency crime during the Restriction Period of 1797–1820.

Entrapment by plainclothes policemen was often used to prosecute gay men, even after the Sexual Offences Act 1967 exempted consensual gay sex in private from prosecution.

In Scotland the main authority is the case of &quot;Brown v. HMA&quot; (2002) which stated that entrapment will occur when law enforcement officials cause an offense to be committed which would not have occurred had it not been for their involvement. The remedies available correspond with those in England and are considered to be either a plea in bar of trial or a challenge to the admissibility of evidence obtained through entrapment.

== United States ==
In the United States, two competing tests exist for determining whether entrapment has taken place, known as the &quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;objective&quot; tests.
* The &quot;subjective&quot; test looks at the defendant&#x27;s state of mind; entrapment can be claimed if the defendant had no &quot;predisposition&quot; to commit the crime.
* The &quot;objective&quot; test looks instead at the government&#x27;s conduct; entrapment occurs when the actions of government officers would usually have caused a normally law-abiding person to commit a crime.

Contrary to popular belief, the United States does not require police officers to identify themselves as police in the case of a sting or other undercover work, and police officers may lie when engaged in such work. The law of entrapment instead focuses on whether people were enticed to commit crimes they would not have otherwise considered in the normal course of events.

===History===
Entrapment defenses in the United States have evolved mainly through case law.

Courts took a dim view of the defense at first. The New York Supreme Court said in 1864 that &quot;[It] has never availed to shield crime or give indemnity to the culprit, and it is safe to say that under any code of civilized, not to say Christian, ethics, it never will&quot;. Forty years later, another judge in that state affirmed that rejection, arguing &quot;[courts] should not hesitate to punish the crime actually committed by the defendant&quot; when rejecting entrapment claimed in a grand larceny case.

Other states, however, had already begun reversing convictions on entrapment grounds. Federal courts recognized entrapment as a defense starting with &quot;Woo Wai v. United States&quot;. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider the question of entrapment in &quot;Casey v. United States&quot;, since the facts in the case were too vague to definitively rule on the question; but, four years later, it did. In &quot;Sorrells v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the conviction of a North Carolina factory worker who gave in to an undercover Prohibition officer&#x27;s repeated entreaties to get him some liquor. It identified the controlling question as &quot;whether the defendant is a person otherwise innocent whom the government is seeking to punish for an alleged offense which is the product of the creative activity of its own officials&quot;.

In &quot;Sherman v. United States&quot;, the Court considered a similar case in which one recovering drug addict working with agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (a predecessor agency to today&#x27;s Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)) solicited another to sell him drugs on the premise that his own efforts were failing. Again unanimous, its opinion focused more clearly on the defendant&#x27;s predisposition to commit the offense and, on that basis, overturned Sherman&#x27;s conviction as well since, although he had two prior drug convictions, the most recent dated back five years. Furthermore, he was attempting to rehabilitate himself, he had made no profit on the sales, and no drugs were found in his apartment when it was searched, suggesting the absence of a predisposition to break drug laws. &quot;To determine whether entrapment has been established&quot;, it said, &quot;a line must be drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal&quot;.

Prosecutors won the next two times entrapment came before the Court, in &quot;United States v. Russell&quot; and &quot;Hampton v. United States&quot;, albeit by narrow margins. In the former, the Court upheld the conviction of a Washington man for manufacturing methamphetamine even though an undercover agent had supplied some of the ingredients, and also pondered an outrageous government conduct defense, though it did not enable it. &quot;Hampton&quot; let stand, by a similar margin, the conviction of a Missouri man who had, upon seeing track marks on the arms of a DEA informant, expressed interest in obtaining heroin to sell. The DEA informant arranged a meeting between the Missouri man and undercover DEA agents in which the Missouri man sold a small quantity of heroin to agents and indicated that he could obtain larger quantities. After a second sale to the undercover agents, he was arrested. The defendant alleged that the informant supplied the drugs and that he had been led to believe, by the informant, that he was not selling heroin but a counterfeit with which he intended to defraud the buyers. Regardless, the Court found he was sufficiently predisposed to sell heroin so as to be criminally liable.

The argument employed in the majority opinion on &quot;Hampton&quot; became known as the &quot;subjective&quot; test of entrapment, since it focused on the defendant&#x27;s state of mind. However, in all cases, concurring opinions had advocated an &quot;objective&quot; test, focusing instead on whether the conduct of the police or other investigators would catch only those &quot;ready and willing to commit crime&quot;. Under the objective approach the defendant&#x27;s personality (i.e., his predisposition to commit the crime) would be immaterial, and the potential for the police conduct to induce a law-abiding person considered in the abstract would be the test. This, supporters argued, avoided the dubious issue of an unexpressed legislative intent on which the &quot;Sorrells&quot; court had relied and instead grounded the entrapment defence, like the exclusionary rule, in the court&#x27;s supervisory role over law enforcement. And like the exclusionary rule, they would have had judges, not juries, decide whether a defendant had been entrapped as a matter of law.

Since the subjective test focusing on predisposition had, unlike the exclusionary rule, not been applied to the states, they were free to follow it as they saw fit. The state courts or legislatures of 37 states have chosen the subjective test, while the others use the objective test. Some have allowed both the judge and the jury to rule on whether the defendant was entrapped.

In the Supreme Court&#x27;s last major ruling on entrapment, &quot;Jacobson v. United States&quot;, which overturned the conviction of a Nebraska man for receiving child pornography via the mail, the subjective vs. objective debate was completely absent. Both the majority and dissenting opinions focused solely on whether the prosecution had established that the defendant had a predisposition for purchasing such material (which had only recently been outlawed at the time of his arrest). Since no other material was found in his home save what he had purchased from the undercover postal inspectors, Justice Byron White believed the operation had implanted the idea in his mind through mailings decrying politicians for assaulting civil liberties by passing laws such as the one the inspectors hoped he would break. Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor disagreed in her dissent, arguing that the record did indeed establish that Jacobson was interested in continuing the purchases.

=== Entrapment by estoppel ===
A subset of the entrapment defense was first recognized by the Supreme Court in &quot;Raley v. Ohio&quot;. There, four defendants were testifying before a committee of the Ohio State Legislature. The chairman of the committee told them that they could assert their right against self-incrimination. They asserted this right, and refused to answer questions. However, Ohio law provided them immunity from prosecution, so the right against self-incrimination was inapplicable, and they were subsequently prosecuted for their failure to answer questions. The Supreme Court overturned three of the four convictions based on the doctrine of entrapment by estoppel. (The fourth refused to state his address, at which point the committee expressed the view that the right against self-incrimination did not apply to that question.)

As described in &quot;United States v. Howell&quot;, the defense &quot;applies when, acting with actual or apparent authority, a government official affirmatively assures the defendant that certain conduct is legal and the defendant reasonably believes that official&quot;.

The entrapment by estoppel defense exists in both federal and city jurisdictions; however, case law remains inconsistent as to whether the misleading advice of e.g. a state official provides protection against federal criminal charges. Examples exist of an appellate court failing to allow an entrapment by estoppel defense where a municipal official provided misleading instructions regarding a state law.

===Federal court===
Federal courts apply a subjective test for claims of entrapment. In federal criminal prosecutions, if a defendant proves entrapment the defendant may not be convicted of the underlying crime. A valid entrapment defense has two related elements:
# government inducement of the crime, and
# the defendant&#x27;s lack of predisposition to engage in the criminal conduct.

The federal entrapment defense is based upon statutory construction, the federal courts&#x27; interpretation of the will of Congress in passing the criminal statutes. As this is not a constitutional prohibition, Congress may change or override this interpretation by passing a law.

===State court===
Each state has its own case law and statutory law that defines when and how the entrapment defense is available, and states may choose to adopt either the subjective or objective test for what government action constitutes entrapment. The essential elements of an entrapment defense are:
# Improper inducement: the government induced the defendant to commit the crime; and
# Lack of predisposition: the defendant (or, under the objective test, an ordinary person in the position of the defendant) would not have committed the crime but for the government&#x27;s inducement.

== European Convention of Human Rights ==

Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights has been interpreted as forbidding prosecution of acts induced by undercover officers. In the case of &quot;Teixeira de Castro v Portugal&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights found that the prosecution of a man for drugs offences after being asked by undercover police to procure heroin was a breach of the defendant&#x27;s rights under Article 6 as the investigating officers&#x27;s actions &quot;went beyond those of undercover agents because they instigated the offence and there is nothing to suggest that without their intervention it would have been committed&quot;. The decision in &quot;Teixeira de Castro&quot; has been used by signatory countries in interpreting domestic law (e.g. in the United Kingdom in the &quot;Looseley&quot; case described above).

<text>Gondwanatherium is a genus of stem-mammal from the extinct suborder Gondwanatheria that lived in Patagonia, South America during the &quot;Age of Dinosaurs&quot;, specifically during the Late Cretaceous (Campanian to Maastrichtian epochs).

== Description ==
The genus and species were named by the Argentinian paleontologist José Bonaparte in 1986. &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; means &quot;Gondwana beast&quot;. The position of gondwanatherians within class Mammalia is not yet clear.

The type species Gondwanatherium patagonicum was discovered in Los Alamitos Formation, Río Negro Province, Patagonia, Argentina in deposits dating to the Upper Cretaceous period.

Though earlier than &quot;Sudamerica&quot;, &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; is considered more anatomically derived (advanced). Thus, an ancestral lineage outlived their later, more specialized descendants.

<text>In music for bowed string instruments, , or more precisely ; ), is an instruction to strike the string with the stick of the bow across the strings.

== History ==
The earliest known use of in Western music is to be found in a piece entitled &quot;Harke, harke&quot;, from the &quot;First Part of Ayres&quot; (1605) by Tobias Hume, where he instructs the gambist to &quot;drum this with the backe of your bow&quot;.

== Sound ==
The percussive sound of battuto has a clear pitch element determined by the distance of the bow from the bridge at the point of contact. As a group of players will never strike the string in exactly the same place, the sound of a section of violins playing is dramatically different from the sound of a single violin doing so.

The wood of the bow can also be drawn across the string – a technique called (&quot;with the wood drawn&quot;). This is much less common, and the plain marking is invariably interpreted to mean &quot;battuto&quot; rather than &quot;tratto&quot;. The sound produced by is very quiet, with an overlay of white noise, but the pitch of the stopped note can be clearly heard. If the sound is too quiet, the bow can be slightly rolled so that a few bow hairs touch the string as well, leading to a slightly less &quot;airy&quot; sound.

== Equipment ==
Some string players object to playing as it can damage the bow; many players have a cheaper bow which they use for such passages, or for pieces which require extended passages. Some players tap the strings with pencils instead of bows, producing a further percussive, lighter sound.

<doc id="216702" wikidata="Q1054121" url="?curid=216702" title="Hammered coinage">
<text>Hammered coinage was the most common form of coins produced from the invention of coins in the first millennium BC until the early modern period of c. the 15th–17th centuries, contrasting to the cast coinage and the later developed milled coinage.

==History==
Hammered coins were produced by placing a blank piece of metal (a &quot;planchet&quot; or &quot;flan&quot;) of the correct weight between two dies, and then striking the upper die with a hammer to produce the required image on both sides. The planchet was usually cast from a mold. The bottom die (sometimes called the &quot;anvil die&quot;) was usually counter sunk in a log or other sturdy surface and was called a &quot;pile&quot;. One of the minters held the die for the other side (called the &quot;trussel&quot;), in his hand while it was struck either by himself or an assistant.

Experimental archeology suggests that a lower die could be expected to last for up to 10,000 strikes depending on the level of wear deemed acceptable. Upper dies seem to have a far greater range of lives with usable lives ranging from just over 100 strikes to nearly 8000 being reported. Combining archaeological evidence with historic records suggests ancient coin producers (in this case the Amphictions at Delphi) could get as many as 47,000 strikes out of an individual die.
In later history, in order to increase the production of coins, hammered coins were sometimes produced from strips of metal of the correct thickness, from which the coins were subsequently cut out. Both methods of producing hammered coins meant that it was difficult to produce coins of a regular diameter. Coins were liable to suffer from &quot;clipping&quot; where unscrupulous people would remove slivers of precious metal since it was difficult to determine the correct diameter of the coin.

Coins were also vulnerable to &quot;sweating&quot;, which is when silver coins would be placed in a bag that would be vigorously shaken. This would produce silver dust, which could later be removed from the bag.

===Milled coins===
The ability to fashion coins from machines (milled coins) caused hammered coins to become gradually obsolete during the 17th century. They were still made in Venice until the 1770s. France became the first country to adopt a full machine-made coin in 1643.

In England, the first non-hammered coins were produced in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in the 1560s, but while machine-produced coins were experimentally produced at intervals over the next century, the production of hammered coins did not finally end until 1662.

===Cast coins===
An alternative method of producing early coins, particularly found in Asia, especially in China, was to cast coins using molds. This method of coin production continued in China into the nineteenth century. Up to a couple of dozen coins could be produced at one time from a single mold, when a &#x27;tree&#x27; of coins (which often contained features such as a square hole in the center) would be produced and the individual coins (called &quot;cash&quot;) would then be broken off.

<text>Gleichen is the name of two groups of castles in Germany, thus named from their resemblance to each other ().

== Castles in Thuringia between Gotha and Erfurt ==
The first is a group of three (hence called &quot;die drei [three] Gleichen&quot;), each situated on a hill in Thuringia between Gotha and Erfurt.
One of these called Gleichen, the Wanderslebener Gleiche (1221 ft. above the sea), was besieged unsuccessfully by the emperor Henry IV in 1088. It was the seat of a line of counts, one of whom, Ernest III, a crusader, is the subject of a romantic legend. Having been captured, he was released from his imprisonment by a Turkish woman, who returned with him to Germany and became his wife, a papal dispensation allowing him to live with two wives at the same time (see Reineck, &quot;Die Sage von der Doppelehe eines Grafen von Gleichen&quot;, 1891). After belonging to the elector of Mainz the castle became the property of Prussia in 1803. The second castle is called Mühlburg (1309 ft. above the sea). This existed as early as 704 and was besieged by Henry IV in 1087. It came into the hands of Prussia in 1803. The third castle, Wachsenburg (1358 ft.), was still inhabited in 1911 and contained a collection of weapons and pictures belonging to its owner, the duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, whose family obtained possession of it in 1368. It was built about 935 (see Beyer, &quot;Die drei Gleichen&quot;, Erfurt, 1898).
== Castles near Göttingen ==
The other group consists of two castles, Neuen-Gleichen and Alten-Gleichen. The former is in ruins, while the latter is barely discernible under the forest cover. They crown two hills south-east of Göttingen, over Bremke.

== The family name of Gleichen ==
The name of Gleichen is taken by the family descended from Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg through his marriage with Laura Wilhelmina Seymour, sister of the 5th Marquess of Hertford and daughter of Admiral Sir George Francis Seymour. A branch of the Hohenlohe family at one time owned part of the county of Gleichen.

<doc id="216707" wikidata="Q1271479" url="?curid=216707" title="Re-education through labor">
<text>Re-education through labor (RTL; ), abbreviated laojiao () was a system of administrative detention in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Active from 1957 to 2013, the system was used to detain persons who were accused of committing minor crimes such as petty theft, prostitution, and trafficking of illegal drugs, as well as political dissidents, petitioners, and Falun Gong followers. It was separated from the much larger &quot;laogai&quot; system of prison labor camps.

Sentences under re-education through labor were typically for one to three years, with the possibility of an additional one-year extension. They were issued as a form of administrative punishment by police, rather than the judicial system. While they were incarcerated, detainees were frequently subjected to a form of political education. Estimates of the number of RTL detainees on any given year range from 190,000 to two million. In 2013, approximately 350 RTL camps were in operation.

On 28 December 2013, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress abolished the re-education through labor system and detainees were released. However, human rights groups have claimed that other forms of extrajudicial detention have taken its place, with some former RTL camps being renamed drug rehabilitation centers.

In 2014, re-education facilities were constructed in Xinjiang and they were used to target a wider context than people who were accused of committing minor crimes and political dissidence. By 2017, these had become the massive Xinjiang internment camps holding 1–3 million people, utilizing forced labor, now recognized as re-education camps by many nations and intergovernmental organizations such as the UN, EU, and human rights groups.

==Re-education through labor and the Chinese penal system==
The People&#x27;s Republic of China employs several forms of correction for people who have been arrested, of which re-education through labor was one. The Laogai Research Foundation classifies re-education through labor as a sub-component under the umbrella of the &quot;laogai&quot; (&quot;reform through labor&quot;) criminal justice system, which generally refers to prisons, prison farms, and labor camps for convicted criminals. Re-education through labor, on the other hand, refers to detentions for persons who are not considered criminals or have only committed minor offenses. Persons detained under re-education through labor were detained in facilities which are separate from the general prison system; furthermore, detainees in these re-education facilities receive a small salary, which &quot;laogai&quot; detainees do not, and in theory have shorter work hours. The &quot;laogai&quot; system is much larger than the re-education through labor system, with the Laogai Research Foundation identifying 1,045 &quot;laogai&quot; camps in 2006 (compared to 346 re-education centers). Both systems, however, involve penal labor and often do not allow trials or judicial hearings. The term &quot;reform through labor&quot; or &quot;laogai&quot; was officially replaced with &quot;prison&quot; in 1994, and the term &quot;re-education center&quot; or &quot;láojiàosuǒ&quot; (劳教所) was replaced with &quot;correctional center&quot; in 2007.

Other components of the prison system include detention centers for individuals awaiting sentence or execution, and juvenile detention camps for individuals under a minimum age (which has varied through the years, and may currently be under 14). The system formerly included components such as custody and repatriation for individuals without a residence permit; &quot;forced job placement,&quot; which has not been widely practiced since the 1990s; and &quot;shelter and investigation,&quot; a system of detentions for individuals under legal investigation, which was abolished in 1996. The Laogai Research Foundation also classifies psychiatric facilities, or &quot;ankang&quot;, as a form of detention for political dissidents, although it is not officially recognized as part of the &quot;laogai&quot; penal system.

==History==
Institutions similar to re-education through labor facilities, but called &quot;new life schools&quot; or &quot;loafers&#x27; camps&quot;, existed in the early 1950s, although they did not become official until the anti-rightist campaigns in 1957 and 1958. A report by Human Rights in China (HRIC) states that re-education through labor was first used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1955 to punish counter-revolutionaries, and in 1957 was officially adopted into law to be implemented by the Ministry of Public Security. The law allowed police to sentence both minor offenders and &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; or &quot;anti-socialist elements&quot; to incarceration in labor camps without the right to a judicial hearing or trial, and did not allow judicial review to take place until after the punishment was being enforced. In the beginning there were no limits to the length for which detainees could be sentenced, and it was not until 1979 that a maximum sentence of four years (three years&#x27; sentence plus one-year extension) was set. In 1983, the management and implementation of the re-education through labor system was passed from the Ministry of Public Security to the Ministry of Justice.

When Falun Gong was banned in mainland China in 1999, re-education through labor became a common punishment for practitioners. Some human rights groups claim that as many as 10,000 Falun Gong members were detained in between 1999 and 2002, with as many as 5,000 detained in 2001.

 More recent estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong adherents are imprisoned in China, with some sources estimating up to half of the official reeducation through labor camp population is Falun Gong practitioners. In some labor camps, Falun Gong practitioners make up the majority population.

There have been numerous calls for the system to be reformed or replaced. As early as 1997, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) called for China to allow judicial control over detentions; in 2000, the UN Committee Against Torture recommended that all forms of administrative detention, including re-education through labor, be abolished; in 2004, the WGAD called for the establishment of rights to due process and counsel for individuals detained; and in 2005, the Special Rapporteur on Torture called for the outright abolition of re-education through labor. The prominent deaths of two inmates in spring 2003 prompted many calls within China for reform of the system, but reform did not happen immediately, though The &quot;China Daily&quot; reported that there was &quot;general consensus&quot; that reform was needed. In March 2007, however, the Chinese government did announce that it would abolish the re-education through labor system and replace it with a more lenient set of laws. According to the proposal, the maximum sentence would be lowered from four years to 18 months; re-education centers would be renamed &quot;correction centers&quot; and have their fences and gates removed. A month later, Chongqing municipality passed a law allowing lawyers to offer legal counsel in re-education through labor cases.

Many human rights groups, however, doubted the efficacy of the proposed reforms, saying that the new laws would only help minor criminals and not help political prisoners, and the reforms would not actually abolish the re-education through labor system. The Laogai Research Foundation stated that lowering the maximum length of detention and changing the names of the detention facilities would not constitute a &quot;fundamental change&quot;. Nine months after the declaration that the laws would be rewritten, the re-education through labor system had not been abolished; in December 2007, a group of academics drafted an open letter to the government calling for an end to the system. During the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, there were reports that some individuals who applied for permits to protest were detained without trial; of these, some were sentenced to re-education through labor. In the United Nations Human Rights Council&#x27;s September 2008 Universal Periodic Review of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, re-education through labor was listed as an &quot;urgent human rights concern,&quot; and as of February 2009, a large number of re-education through labor camps were still in operation.

===Statistics===
Reports on re-education through labor have found it difficult to estimate the number of people in re-education centers, and nationwide statistics were often unavailable in the past. What data have become available often vary widely.

Of these detainees, 5 to 10 percent are estimated to be political prisoners, and as many as 40 percent are estimated to be drug offenders—in 1998, nearly one-third of the known re-education camps were specifically built for the purpose of holding drug offenders.

The &quot;China Daily&quot; estimated that there were a total of 310 re-education centers in China in 2007. The 2008 edition of the Laogai Research Foundation&#x27;s biennial report listed exactly 319 &quot;confirmed&quot; re-education centers in China, and 74 &quot;unconfirmed&quot; ones, but it also estimated that the actual number of such centers might be much higher. the provinces with the most centers being Guangdong (31), Heilongjiang (21), and Henan (21). In a February 2009 meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the Chinese government stated that there are 320 centers. The provinces with the largest numbers of re-education centers include Guangdong, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Henan. At the end of 2008, there were 350 labor camps and 160,000 prisoners were being held in them.

==Detentions==

===Conviction and detention===
Sentencing for re-education through labor is generally carried out by the police rather than by the judicial system, so individuals are rarely charged or tried before being detained. Public security bureaus (police offices) are able to carry out administrative detentions for &quot;minor&quot; infringements that are not considered criminal acts; at least one analyst has suggested that local public security bureaus often abuse their authority and detain individuals for things such as personal vendettas. Individuals may also be sentenced to re-education through labor by courts, but the proportion of individuals who receive trials rather than going directly into administrative detention is determined in part by how much capacity that province has for re-education detainees—provinces with large re-education through labor apparatus generally allow fewer detainees to have trials. Where detainees have been allowed a trial, their lawyers have faced &quot;intimidation and abuse,&quot; according to some reports, and the individuals under trial have sometimes been convicted on the basis of confessions that were coerced through &quot;torture and severe psychological pressure.&quot; In at least one instance, convicted individuals were sent to re-education through labor even after being found not guilty in a trial.

Most detainees in re-education through labor facilities are reported to be drug users, petty criminals, and prostitutes, as well as some political prisoners; James Seymour has also claimed that most individuals sentenced to re-education through labor are from urban areas. Individuals who attempt to leave the country illegally have also been sentenced to re-education through labor upon their return. In periods leading up to visits from foreign dignitaries or politically sensitive anniversaries (such as the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989), local authorities have supposedly detained &quot;undesirables&quot; such as the homeless, mentally or physically disabled individuals, and migrant workers. One China specialist at the RAND Corporation has claimed that the police, faced with a lack of &quot;modern rehabilitation and treatment programs,&quot; use re-education through labor convictions to &quot;warehouse&quot; individuals for &quot;an increasing number of social problems.&quot;

Detainees can seek to have their detention repealed through an &quot;administrative review&quot; (&quot;xingzheng fuyi&quot;, 行政复议) of the decision or by filing an &quot;administrative litigation&quot; (&quot;xingzheng susong&quot; 行政诉讼) against the Re-education Through Labor Management Committee that detained them. According to the advocacy group Chinese Human Rights Defenders, however, these options are ineffective and the groups overseeing the reviews and litigations often have the same interests as the management committee that originally ordered the detention.

===Conditions in the facilities===

The United States Department of State called the conditions in prisons &quot;harsh and frequently degrading,&quot; and said the conditions in re-education through labor facilities were similar, citing overcrowded living spaces, low-quality food, and poor or absent medical care. Detainees in camps are required to work for little or no pay; while Chinese law requires that prison laborers&#x27; workday be limited to 12 hours a day. In 2001, sociologist Dean Rojek estimated that detainees generally worked six days a week, &quot;in total silence.&quot; Much of the labor done by re-education through labor detainees is geared towards agriculture or producing goods, many of which are sold internationally, since re-education through labor detainees are not counted as official &quot;prisoners&quot; and therefore not subject to international treaties. They also perform work ranging &quot;from tending vegetables and emptying septic pits to cutting stone blocks and construction work.&quot;

Although drug abusers are ostensibly placed in re-education through labor to be treated for their addictions, some testimonial evidence has suggested that little &quot;meaningful treatment&quot; takes place in at least some of the centers, and that drug abusers often relapse into addiction upon their release from detention.

The facilities have been widely criticized for the physical abuse that is said to go on within them. Corporal punishment is commonly used, and torture and physical abuse are also thought to be widespread in the facilities. In April 2003, Zhang Bin, an inmate at the re-education facility Huludao City Correctional Camp, was beaten to death, reportedly by other inmates and by the labor supervisor. Zhang&#x27;s death, along with the March 2003 death of inmate Sun Zhigang in a custody and repatriation prison, sparked calls within China for reform of the system, although reforms were not made immediately.

Though most reports describe the conditions of re-education camps as &quot;brutal,&quot; there are some claims of prisoners being well-treated. For example, when he was released from a three-year re-education sentence in 1999, dissident Liu Xiaobo said that he had been treated very mildly, that he had been allowed to spend time reading, and that the conditions had been &quot;pretty good.&quot;

Forced labor may include breaking rocks and assembling car seat covers, and even gold farming in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

According to Chinese state media Xinhua, slightly over 50% of detainees released from prison and re-education through labor in 2006 received government aid in the form of funds or assistance in finding jobs.

===Life after release===
Detainees who are released from re-education through labor camps may still be unable to travel or see other people freely. Individuals who remain in re-education through labor for 5 or more years may not be allowed to return to their homes, and those who do may be closely monitored and not permitted to leave certain areas. For example, in July 2003 a priest who had been released from detention was kept under house arrest, and five men who attempted to visit him were themselves detained.

==Criticism==
The re-education through labor system has been criticized by human rights groups, foreign governments and UN bodies, and Chinese rights lawyers. Some Chinese government agencies and reformers within government have likewise criticized the system as being unconstitutional, and advocated for its reform or abolition.

Human Rights Watch has stated that the &quot;re-education through labor&quot; system violates international law, specifically Article 9 (4.)of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provides that &quot;Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention...&quot; Re-education through labor has also been criticized by numerous human rights groups for not offering procedural guarantees for the accused, and for being used to detain political dissidents, teachers, Chinese house church leaders, and Falun Gong practitioners. Furthermore, even though the law up until 2007 specified a maximum length of detainment of four years, at least one source mentions a &quot;retention for in-camp employment&quot; system that allowed authorities to keep detainees in the camps for longer than their official sentences.

Re-education through labor has been a focus of discussion not only among foreign human rights groups, but also among legal scholars in China, some of whom were involved in the drafting of the 2007 laws meant to replace the system.

In addition to legal scholars, the Supreme People&#x27;s Court of the People&#x27;s Republic of China had criticized the system. In light of the widespread disapproval of the system, HRIC called in 2001 for the system to be abolished entirely. Among its criticisms it cited the fact that the wording of re-education through labor laws was excessively vague, allowing authorities to manipulate it; the fact that the punishment given in re-education centers was too severe for the crimes committed; the abusive conditions at re-education centers; and the variation of re-education through labor laws from one province to another. The Chinese Ministry of Justice, has also noted that the system violated items in the Chinese constitution. Wang Gongyi, vice-director of the Institute of Justice Research affiliated to the Ministry of Justice, said that the re-education through labor system contradicts several items in the Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Law, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China signed in 1998.

Although many human rights groups and legal scholars both within and without China called for the reform or total abolition of re-education through labor, China&#x27;s security agencies have defended the use of the system as being necessary to maintain social stability. A 1997 report in China&#x27;s &quot;Legal Daily&quot; hailed re-education through labor as a means to &quot;maintain social peace and prevent and reduce crime.&quot; The Ministry of Public Security stated in 2005 that re-education through labor helped maintain rule of law and was mainly used for rehabilitating lawbreakers. In 2007, when new laws were drafted, the Ministry of Public Security was opposed to the proposal that would allowing judicial review before punishment was enforced.

===Profit opportunities===
The &quot;laojiao&quot; system employs tens of thousands of people. Profits are made through sale of the products of forced labor and through the collection of bribes received to reduce sentences or to ensure that relatives receive adequate food.

==Abolition==
During the Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress in Beijing on 15 November 2013, Chinese officials announced that they planned to abolish the Re-education Through Labor system.

The planned abolition of the system, however, has been criticised by human rights groups, with Amnesty International issuing a report titled &quot;Changing the Soup but Not the Medicine.&quot; Amnesty&#x27;s report concludes that the camp closures are a positive step forward for human rights, but the fundamental problems of arbitrary detention remain in China:

Many of the policies and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP&#x27;s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to &quot;brainwashing centres&quot; and other forms of arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to &quot;black jails&quot; and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, &quot;black jails&quot;, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.

On 28 December 2013, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress abolished the re-education through labor system. Detainees were released without finishing their sentences.

<doc id="216713" wikidata="Q162069" url="?curid=216713" title="Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables">
<text>Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables is the debut studio album by the American punk rock band Dead Kennedys. It was first released on September 2, 1980, through Cherry Red Records in the United Kingdom, and I.R.S. Records in the United States. It was later issued by Jello Biafra&#x27;s own Alternative Tentacles label in the United States. It is the only Dead Kennedys studio album to feature drummer Bruce Slesinger and (on one track) guitarist Carlo Cadona.

==Recording and release==
The photo on the front cover, showing several police cars on fire, was taken during the White Night riots of May 21, 1979, that resulted from the light sentence given to former San Francisco City Supervisor Dan White for the murder of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. When Biafra ran for mayor, one of his policies had been for a statue to be erected to Dan White, and for eggs, tomatoes and stones to be available nearby for pelting it. In addition, the band&#x27;s version of &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; has rewritten lyrics making reference to the incident.

==Reception==
Among contemporary reviews, Jon Young of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; found that the style and content of the album derived from the Sex Pistols and &quot;will sound dated to the trend-conscious&quot;, but concluded that the album &quot;may be the only legitimate companion piece to the Pistols&#x27; &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;.&quot; Young concluded that the album &quot;works largely because of Jello Biafra, a distinctive and remarkable singer&quot; who &quot;thrives on extreme attitudes.&quot; Andy Gill of &quot;NME&quot; compared the album to music by the British punk group U.K. Subs, writing that Dead Kennedys &quot;hardly come across as anything but smarter, both musically and intellectually ... Despite [the Dead Kennedys&#x27;] grasp of dynamics and their highly-ordered arrangements, there&#x27;s really only one track here which makes effective use of their mannerisms and devices, and that&#x27;s &#x27;Holiday in Cambodia&#x27;, already available in single form, and probably the biggest (musical) reason for this album&#x27;s presence in the charts.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; stated that he found Biafra poor as a vocalist, likening his singing to Tiny Tim&#x27;s.

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 365 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

In 2010, it was certified diamond by the Independent Music Companies Association which indicated sales of at least 250,000 copies throughout Europe.

==Release variations==
* The original back cover featured a found photograph of an old lounge band called Sounds of Sunshine, with Dead Kennedys&#x27; logo pasted onto the drum kit and skulls and crossbones spliced onto their instruments. The original photograph, as found by Flouride at a garage sale, had no identifying remarks on it whatsoever, and was used because the band thought it was &quot;hilarious&quot;. Somehow, Warner Wilder, the former vocalist of the defunct lounge band, learned of the photo and threatened to sue Dead Kennedys. The back cover was reprinted with the heads of the band members cut off, but this solution was found to be unsatisfactory to Sounds of Sunshine, forcing an entirely different photo of four old people in a living room (with the Alternative Tentacles bat mascot pasted over a picture frame). When Cleopatra Records reissued &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; in 2002, the original unbeheaded lounge band picture reappeared. The 25th Anniversary &quot;Deluxe Reissue&quot; co-released by Cherry Red Records and Manifesto Records in 2005 used the old people photograph, but with Dead Kennedys&#x27; logo substituted for the Alternative Tentacles Bat.
* Early I.R.S. pressings featured the cover tinted orange with black lettering. This cover variation was not authorized by the band. According to a late &#x27;80s interview Biafra did with &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine, I.R.S. told the band they wanted to make the domestic version different from the Cherry Red import, to which Biafra claimed to have told I.R.S., &quot;Yeah, inferior to the original — change it back!&quot; During a 1981 performance at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., Biafra mentions, &quot;Some of you stooped so low as to buy our wonderful album, even with the shitty Disneyland orange cover which was &quot;not&quot; our idea.&quot;
* Post-I.R.S., pre-Alternative Tentacles pressings on I.R.S.&#x27;s Faulty Products subsidiary added &quot;Police Truck&quot; to the middle of the Side A sequence, between &quot;Let&#x27;s Lynch the Landlord&quot; and &quot;Drug Me&quot;.
* Some Cherry Red vinyl pressings added &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot; to the end of Side A.
* Pirate pressings of &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; (as well as the next two Dead Kennedys releases, &quot;In God We Trust Inc.&quot; and &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot;) were manufactured in Italy, Spain and Portugal. According to Biafra, these pressings were manufactured by someone who retained the master parts from defunct Italian licensees and put out what Biafra described as &quot;Clorox bottle-quality pressings&quot;. These pressings were sold by a cut-out distributor to record stores that were, in Biafra&#x27;s words, &quot;too snooty&quot; to deal with the independent distributors that Alternative Tentacles dealt with.
* The run-out groove of the early Alternative Tentacles pressings as well as early Cherry Red pressings includes the text &quot;Well?? Who &quot;are&quot; the Brain Police???&quot;—a reference to the song &quot;Who Are the Brain Police?&quot; by the Mothers of Invention.
* Manifesto Records released a fully remixed version of &quot;Fresh Fruit&quot; in September of 2022, remixed by Chris Lord-Alge. The release, instigated by the band member partnership&#x27;s manager (who had personal ties with Lord-Alge) and approved by band members Ray Pepperell, Klaus Flouride and Darren Henley (the latter of whom was not a member of the band at the time), was criticized by Biafra in a July 2022 press release. Biafra also noted that, while respecting Lord-Alge&#x27;s track record, did not feel Lord-Alge was the right person to remix any Dead Kennedys material.

==Track listing==


==&quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Eyeballs&quot;==
&quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Eyeballs&quot; is the accompanying 55-minute documentary, directed by Eric S. Goodfield, that is included with the &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; 25th Anniversary Edition. It features a brief history of Dead Kennedys&#x27; early years up to their first UK tour, never before seen live performances, interviews with Klaus Flouride and East Bay Ray, comments by music journalists, and insights from the key people involved with the recording of &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot;. The video omits references to the origins of songs that would include a mention of Jello Biafra, although his 1979 run for mayor is highlighted.

<doc id="216714" wikidata="Q2836694" url="?curid=216714" title="The Bungalow Mystery">
<text>The Bungalow Mystery is the third volume in the &quot;Nancy Drew Mystery Stories&quot; series written under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. It was the last of three books in the &quot;breeder set&quot; trilogy, released in 1930, to test-market the series.

It was the final volume edited by Edward Stratemeyer before his death. His daughter, Harriet Stratemeyer Adams, extensively revised the novel in 1960.

==Plot summaries==

===1930 edition===

Laura Pendleton rescues Nancy Drew and her friend Helen, who can&#x27;t swim, when their rowboat capsizes during a sudden, severe storm on Moon Lake. The girls from River Heights befriend the orphaned Laura, who has come to the area to meet her new guardian, Jacob Aborn. Mr. Aborn seems somewhat boorish to the River Heights girls, and Nancy, upon returning home, receives a phone call from Laura, who is desperate to escape from her &quot;evil&quot; guardian. He expects her to do household chores and cook, which seems natural, but when he demands her furs and jewels, she calls Nancy for help. Laura escapes, and this leads Nancy back to the Aborn house, spying on a mysterious bungalow in the woods that he frequents. Nancy eventually enters the bungalow but is quickly hit on the head and knocked unconscious. However, when Nancy comes to, she soon exposes an impostor, who had intended to steal all of Laura&#x27;s stocks and investments, as well as her jewels.

===1960 revision===

The plot is similar, but the mystery takes longer to develop; unusual, in that revised versions of Nancy Drew typically reduce detail and speed up the action. Nancy and Helen meet Laura after she rescues them on the lake; the girls are on vacation while Helen and her aunt plan the former&#x27;s upcoming wedding. The girls meet Laura&#x27;s guardians, Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Aborn, more dramatically: Bleached-haired Mrs. Aborn arrives at the hotel in disarray after having a flat tire in the same storm that caught the girls on the lake. Nancy finds the Aborns gauche but friendly. Nancy is called home to aid injured Hannah Gruen; as in the original, she encounters a tree on the road, but this time a brother and sister appear, and help her.

Upon returning home, Nancy looks after Hannah and takes over the housekeeping chores. Carson Drew assigns her to investigate a long list of individuals suspected of involvement in investment-securities fraud. Nancy tackles this by dressing more maturely (the first time she implements an appearance change to sleuth in the series chronology) and going door-to-door for charity as a ruse to meet the suspects. This subplot adds time and depth to the story.

Laura contacts Nancy surreptitiously to ask for her help, and then escapes from her locked room at the Aborn residence to seek refuge at the Drews&#x27;. Mrs. Aborn had ordered Laura to hand over valuable jewels, but she carried them to Nancy&#x27;s house.

The rest of the mystery unfolds similarly to the 1930 edition, although Nancy fixes Laura up on a date with her friend Don Cameron, and she goes to investigate the Aborn lake house under the ruse of being on vacation back at the same hotel from the opening chapters. A feature fixture that appears vaguely in other volumes is introduced here: Nancy carries a suitcase in her trunk that contains clothing appropriate for outdoor wear, an evening dress with accessories, and swimwear, plus cosmetics, etc. The main difference in the new edition&#x27;s final chapters is that the Aborns are acting as impostors together as a couple; Jacob Aborn&#x27;s wife was on vacation and Stumpy closely resembled Jacob Aborn, allowing for the substitution. They are the couple Nancy couldn&#x27;t locate in River Heights, who committed the banking crimes her father was investigating. Laura discovers that the real Aborns are wonderful people who would be caring guardians. To reward Nancy for helping her and rescuing her valuables, Laura presents the sleuth with her mother&#x27;s favorite ring—an aquamarine, a reminder that their friendship began on water.

==Artwork==

The original 1930 artwork—Nancy peeking into the abandoned bungalow—was created by Russell H. Tandy, who also designed the frontispiece and three internals for the original version. In 1937, the three internals were omitted. In 1943, Tandy executed a completely new pen-and-ink drawing for the frontispiece instead of updating earlier illustrations.

In 1950, Bill Gillies created new cover artwork, showing Nancy spying on Stumpy Dowd. This artwork was retained for the 1960 revision, which also added a frontispiece and five pen-and-ink internal illustrations.

In 1965, the cover was updated by Rudy Nappi to show Nancy dressed in a matronly dress, contrasting with the current &quot;mod&quot; look, and spying on the bungalow in the woods. These illustrations are all in print today.

==Reception==
By 2000, &quot;The Bungalow Mystery&quot; had sold 1.5 million copies in the US market.

==Adaptations ==
The 12th installment in the Nancy Drew point-and-click adventure game series by Her Interactive, named &quot;Nancy Drew: Secret of the Old Clock&quot;, is loosely based on the novel and also incorporate elements from &quot;The Secret of the Old Clock&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Staircase&quot;, and &quot;The Mystery at Lilac Inn&quot;.

The elements from this story include the girl, Emily Crandall, who is the replacement character for Laura Pendleton; Emily&#x27;s &quot;questionable&quot; guardian, Jane Willoughby (a culmination character of the fake Mr. and Mrs. Aborn), Emily&#x27;s mother (who is named Gloria Crandall nee Dowd in the game instead of Marie Pendleton), and Jim Archer, who is only a family friend instead of being a Laura&#x27;s fiancé as in the book. Gloria&#x27;s maiden name Dowd is also a reference to the Dowds, who are the criminals in the book. Also, the style of Richard Topham&#x27;s school is in the style of a bungalow. Finally, the storyline of this book is one of the two main stories in the game like Emily/Laura needing to protect her mother&#x27;s jewels. The other one being the storyline from The Secret of the Old Clock.

A part of this book, the Road Construction sign and trying to cross the bridge with planks, was seen in the Hardy Boys Nancy Drew episode, &quot;The Mystery of the Diamond Triangle&quot;.

<doc id="216716" wikidata="Q325417" url="?curid=216716" title="Gareth Williams, Baron Williams of Mostyn">
<text>Gareth Wyn Williams, Baron Williams of Mostyn, (5 February 1941 – 20 September 2003), was a Welsh barrister and Labour politician who was Leader of the House of Lords, Lord President of the Council and a member of the Cabinet from 2001 until his sudden death in 2003.

==Early life==
Williams was born near Prestatyn, in North Wales, a son of Albert Thomas Williams and his wife Selina, &quot;née&quot; Evans. He was educated at Rhyl Grammar School and at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge.

==Legal career==
He was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1965, he became Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1978, was a Recorder from 1978, a Deputy High Court Judge, 1986–92, the Leader of the Wales and Chester Circuit, 1987–89, and a Member of the Bar Council, 1986–92 (Chairman, 1992).

==Political career==
He was created a life peer on 20 July 1992 as Baron Williams of Mostyn, &quot;of Great Tew in the County of Oxfordshire&quot;, and became an opposition spokesman in the House of Lords on Legal Affairs, and later Northern Ireland. After Labour&#x27;s election victory he was appointed a Home Office minister, and in 1999 became Attorney General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland. He was appointed Leader of the House of Lords in 2001, initially with the sinecure office of Lord Privy Seal, for which Lord President of the Council was substituted in 2003.

==Reputation among his colleagues==
As part of the celebrations to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Life Peerages Act, Lord Williams was voted by the current members of the House of Lords as the outstanding life peer since the creation of the life peerage. In his book &quot;A View from the Foothills&quot; Chris Mullin wrote that he thought that Gareth Williams was most likely to succeed Derry Irvine as Lord Chancellor; in the event the position was next filled by Charles Falconer.

==Personal life==
Williams married Pauline Clarke in 1962, and they had three children. They divorced, and he then married Veena M. Russell in 1994, and by her had one daughter, Imogen. He died from a heart attack at his home in Evenlode, Gloucestershire on 20 September 2003, aged 62, and was buried at St Michael and all Angels Church in Great Tew, Oxfordshire.

<doc id="216717" wikidata="Q2441327" url="?curid=216717" title="Ferugliotherium">
<text>Ferugliotherium is a genus of fossil mammals in the family Ferugliotheriidae from the Campanian and/or Maastrichtian period (Late Cretaceous; around 70 million years ago) of Argentina. It contains a single species, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, which was first described in 1986. Although originally interpreted on the basis of a single brachydont (low-crowned) molar as a member of Multituberculata, an extinct group of small, rodent-like mammals, it was recognized as related to the hypsodont (high-crowned) Sudamericidae following the discovery of additional material in the early 1990s. After a jaw of the sudamericid &quot;Sudamerica&quot; was described in 1999, these animals (collectively known as Gondwanatheria) were no longer considered to be multituberculates and a few fossils that were previously considered to be &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; were assigned to unspecified multituberculates instead. Since 2005, a relationship between gondwanatheres and multituberculates has again received support. A closely related animal, &quot;Trapalcotherium&quot;, was described in 2009 on the basis of a single tooth.

About twenty teeth and a jaw fragment have been referred to &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, but the assignment of many of these is controversial or has been superseded. The upper and lower incisors are long and rodent-like and have enamel on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the tooth socket of the lower incisor was very long, extending below the fourth premolar (p4). The p4 is preserved in this fragment. It is blade-shaped and resembles multituberculate p4s. However, the determination of this fossil as &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; is in question. The identity of a few additional isolated premolars assigned to &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, some resembling multituberculates, is also uncertain. The first lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four examples, of which two were originally identified as upper molars of a different species (&quot;Vucetichia gracilis&quot;), which is now considered a synonym of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;. They bear two longitudinal rows of three or four cusps and transverse crests and furrows. A single example each of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) show that these teeth also had longitudinal cusp rows and transverse furrows and crests, but the mf2 had only two or perhaps three cusps per row and the MF1 had three longitudinal rows.

Although &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; teeth are much lower-crowned than those of the Sudamericidae, they share an essentially similar pattern on the occlusal (chewing) surface of mf1 and mf2, similar incisors, backward jaw movement during chewing, and enamel with small prisms. &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; is thought to have been a small animal, with a body mass of about 70 g (2.5 oz), and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two geological formations of southern Argentina, where it is part of a mammal fauna that also includes the sudamericid &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; and a variety of dryolestoids.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Ferugliotherium windhauseni&quot; was named in 1986 by Argentinean paleontologist José Bonaparte on the basis of a single second lower molar (m2) from the Late Cretaceous Los Alamitos Formation of Argentina. Both the generic name, &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, and the specific name, &quot;windhauseni&quot;, honor geologists who studied the geology of Patagonia: Egidio Feruglio and Anselmo Windhausen, respectively. Bonaparte created a new family, Ferugliotheriidae, for the new species and tentatively assigned it to Multituberculata, an extinct group of mammals that was diverse during the late Cretaceous, mostly in the northern continents (Laurasia). In subsequent years, other finds permitted a more confident assignment to Multituberculata. In 1990, Bonaparte described &quot;Vucetichia gracilis&quot; on the basis of what he interpreted as two upper molars of a relative of &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; within the order Gondwanatheria, a small mammalian group that was at the time known only from Argentinean fossils and thought to be related to xenarthrans as part of a now-discarded group called Paratheria. The generic name, &quot;Vucetichia&quot;, commemorates Argentinean paleontologist Guiomar Vucetich, and the specific name, &quot;gracilis&quot; (Latin for &quot;slender&quot;), refers to the animal&#x27;s small size.

However, in 1990 David W. Krause and Bonaparte argued that Gondwanatheria, including &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; (family Ferugliotheriidae), &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot;, and &quot;Sudamerica&quot; (family Sudamericidae), should be placed within Multituberculata. Two years later, Krause, Bonaparte, and Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska described additional material of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; (which they tentatively placed in the multituberculate suborder Plagiaulacoidea) and suggested that the supposed upper molars of &quot;Vucetichia&quot; were in fact heavily worn first lower molariforms (mf1) of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;. In 1993, Krause described an unworn mf1 of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and confirmed that &quot;Vucetichia&quot; was based on worn specimens of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and therefore a synonym of the latter. In the same year, he and Bonaparte argued once again that &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot;, and &quot;Sudamerica&quot; formed a closely related group of multituberculates, which they called the superfamily Gondwanatherioidea. Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte described a lower jaw fragment with a multituberculate-like lower fourth premolar (p4) from Los Alamitos in 1996 and tentatively identified it as &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;. On the basis of the morphological features of the jaw fragment, they argued that gondwanatherians were not closely related to any other multituberculate group, and consequently placed them in a suborder of their own, Gondwanatheria.

In 1999, Rosendo Pascual and colleagues described a jaw of &quot;Sudamerica&quot;. Because some of this jaw&#x27;s features were thought to be incompatible with a multituberculate identity, they regarded gondwanatheres (including &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;) as Mammalia &quot;incertae sedis&quot;. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;) and multituberculates. The controversy is partially due to disagreement over the assignment of two upper premolars and the jaw fragment described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996; Gurovich and Beck identify these as &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, while Kielan-Jaworowska and others regard them as indeterminate multituberculates.

In the 2000s, some possible close relatives of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; were discovered. An enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Peru, LACM 149371, was described in 2004 as possibly related to the family Ferugliotheriidae. Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues described a p4 from the La Colonia Formation (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) as a new multituberculate genus, &quot;Argentodites&quot;, in 2007, but Gurovich and Beck noted close similarities between this p4 and the p4 in the possible jaw fragment of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and suggested that it represented &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; or a closely related species. A single mf1 from the Allen Formation (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) was described as another ferugliotheriid genus, &quot;Trapalcotherium&quot;, in 2009.

==Description==

&quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; is known from isolated teeth, the assignment of some of which is controversial. The material from the Los Alamitos Formation, which is mostly in the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia (MACN) in Buenos Aires, with one tooth in the Museo de La Plata (MLP) in La Plata, Argentina, has been thoroughly described; while there are additional &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; fossils from the La Colonia Formation, they have not been described in detail. Although the fragmentary nature of the known fossils of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; makes it impossible to determine its dental formula with certainty, Gurovich suggested that it had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars on each side of the lower and upper jaws. However, on the basis of comparisons with &quot;Sudamerica&quot;, which is known to have had four lower molariforms (molar-like teeth, either premolars or molars) in its lower jaw, Pascual and Ortiz-Jaureguizar suggested in 2007 that &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; may also have had four lower molars.

&quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; was much smaller than the sudamericids &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; and &quot;Sudamerica&quot;, and its body mass is estimated to have been about 70 g (2.5 oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction of wear on the teeth indicates that &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot;, and &quot;Sudamerica&quot; all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.

===Incisors===
Three fragmentary &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; lower incisors (MACN Pv-RN 701A, 701B, and 701C) are known from the Los Alamitos Formation. Another incisor, MACN Pv-RN 970, was assigned to &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; by Bonaparte in 1990, but it is much larger than the other three incisors, which are otherwise similar, and probably represents &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; instead. Only the tips of the three incisors are preserved. They are laterally compressed, with an estimated width of 1.3 mm and height of 2.4 mm in 701A. The medial side (towards the middle of the mouth) is flat, but the lateral side (towards the sides) is convex. There is enamel only on the lower (ventral) side. A large wear facet is present at the tip, forming an angle of about 35° with the ventral margin in 701A. The three incisor fragments are identified as &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; because of their size and provenance and the presence of a restricted enamel band. They show features, such as lateral compression, an acute angle at the tip, small curvature, and an irregular cross section, that are usually seen in lower, not upper incisors in mammals with incisors, such as rodents and taeniolabidoid multituberculates.

Four specimens (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) are thought to represent second upper incisors (I2) of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;. 702A (height 1.5 mm; width 1.1 mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2 mm; width 0.9 mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C&#x27;s wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were deciduous precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the dorsal side. The wear facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors because they have a less acute angle at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.

Incisors of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; are similar in overall shape and share a restricted band of enamel—a feature otherwise seen only in multituberculates among Mesozoic mammals. The incisors of &quot;Sudamerica&quot; are also similar.

===Mandible with lower premolar===
MACN Pv-RN 975, a fragment of the mandible (lower jaw) preserving one premolar, was discovered in 1991 and tentatively identified as &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, but this assignment remains controversial. The poorly preserved and worn premolar is a bladelike tooth, resembling multituberculate fourth lower premolars (p4). The premolar is 4.8 mm long and bears eight faint ridges on both the labial (towards the lips) and lingual (towards the tongue) sides. On the labial side, the four ridges at the back are more widely separated than the four in front of them. The back and front margins of the tooth are parallel and there is no small cusp on the labial side. There are two roots; the one at the front is larger than the one at the back and bears a furrow. The lower border of the enamel cover is marked by two semicircular extensions of the enamel on the front side, but there is only one such extension at the back. By its size, the number of ridges, and apparently greater length than height, it differs from all known multituberculate first, second, and third lower premolars, indicating that it is a p4.

The dentary (lower jaw bone) itself is robust and short. The length axis of the p4 makes an angle of about 58° with the length axis of the jawbone. The bone is concave on the lingual, but convex on the labial side. There is a diastema (gap) between the p4 and the incisor that would have been in front of it, as in the jaw of &quot;Sudamerica&quot;. Gurovich estimated the length of the diastema as 2.5 mm. There is a rounded mental foramen (an opening in the labial side of the jawbone), with a diameter of 0.7 mm, located about 0.8 mm below the dorsal margin of the bone and 1.5 mm in front of the p4. Although the incisor itself is not preserved, its alveolus (the housing of the root) is in part. As in &quot;Sudamerica&quot;, it extends far into the dentary, passing below p4. The alveolus is 1.5 mm wide below the front root of p4 and 1.4 mm at the back of the jaw fragment. Although the height of the alveolus cannot be determined because the lower side is broken away, the incisor must have been quite deep.

When it was discovered that &quot;Sudamerica&quot; had four molariform teeth and no bladelike premolar in its lower jaw, Pascual, Kielan-Jaworowska, and colleagues removed MACN Pv-RN 975 from &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, which they expected to have the same dental formula as its fellow gondwanathere &quot;Sudamerica&quot;, and identified it as an indeterminate multituberculate instead. Pascual and colleagues argued that molariform teeth as seen in &quot;Sudamerica&quot; could not have evolved from the bladelike p4 of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, and that it was unlikely that additional molars had been added in &quot;Sudamerica&quot;. In 2004 and 2007, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues aligned the dentary with the multituberculate suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; because the p4 is rectangular in labial view, not curved as in the suborder Cimolodonta. This feature was also used to distinguish MACN Pv-RN 975 from the single p4 assigned to &quot;Argentodites&quot;, which was tentatively placed in Cimolodonta.

Gurovich, Guillermo Rougier, and colleagues, on the other hand, maintain that the dentary is referable to &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and that the p4s of &quot;Argentodites&quot; and MACN Pv-RN 975 are very similar. The alveolus of MACN Pv-RN 975 fits the lower incisors attributed to &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; in size and the blade-like premolar is of the size expected for an animal with molariforms the size of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; teeth. If the dentary and premolars (whose identification has been similarly controversial; see below) do not belong to &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, then, Gurovich and Beck argue, the Los Alamitos Formation would contain two mammals (&quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and a multituberculate) similar in size and morphology, and therefore presumably occupying similar ecological niches—and one of those would be represented only by molariforms and incisors and the other only by premolars and a jaw fragment among the available fossils. Furthermore, they noted that the transition from blade-like to molariform premolars had actually been observed in the fossil record of the extinct sthenurine kangaroos, and that the first molariform in &quot;Sudamerica&quot; and &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; is laterally compressed, suggesting that it may have derived from a blade-like tooth. Gurovich and Beck attributed the difference in shape between the MACN Pv-RN 975 and &quot;Argentodites&quot; p4s to the extensive wear of the former, and suggested that the two are similar enough that they probably represent at least closely related species.

===Other premolars===
Krause and colleagues identified a single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 251, as a possible deciduous anterior (i.e., not p4 or dp4, the deciduous version of p4) lower premolar of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;. It is minuscule, with a length of 0.85 mm and width of 0.5 mm (assuming the tooth is oriented correctly). It bears two serrations (small projections) at the tip of the crown—one around the middle of the crown and the other at what may be the back of the crown, where it is highest. Two prominent ridges descend from each serration towards the front down the sides of the tooth. No roots are preserved, but the rounded surface of the lower side of the tooth suggests they may have been resorbed, which would indicate that the tooth is deciduous. Krause and colleagues suggested that the tooth may have been the frontmost premolar, whether deciduous or permanent. However, Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte wrote that this tooth does not match the partial jaw MACN Pv-RN 975, which has no alveoli in front of p4, and Pascual and colleagues agreed in 1999 that the tooth probably does not belong to &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;.

Bonaparte had identified another tooth, MACN Pv-RN 252, as a possible &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; lower premolar in 1990, but this fossil is very fragmentary and according to Krause and colleagues, it cannot even be proven to be a mammalian tooth.

Krause and colleagues identified two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row B) includes at least two, but is damaged. In row A, there are three ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending from the tip of the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though it would come from the opposite side of the mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55 μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot;, &quot;Sudamerica&quot;, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, the prism sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; and possibly &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;.

Krause and colleagues wrote that these two teeth resemble multituberculate deciduous anterior upper premolars, particularly second and third premolars (P2 and P3), and used this as one of their arguments for identifying &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; as a multituberculate. However, as with the dentary MACN Pv-RN 975, the two upper premolars were excluded from &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and identified as multituberculates by Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues after the discovery of the jaw of &quot;Sudamerica&quot;. Gurovich continues to identify them as &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; on the basis of their size and provenance and other similarities between &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and multituberculates.

===Lower molariforms===
Five putative lower molariforms of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; are known from the Los Alamitos Formation (MACN Pv-RN 20, 174, 175, and 253 and MLP 88-III-28-1). These teeth include the holotypes of &quot;Ferugliotherium windhauseni&quot; (MACN Pv-RN 20, the only second lower molariform, or m2) and &quot;Vucetichia gracilis&quot; (MACN Pv-RN 174).

The best-preserved mf1 is MLP 88-III-28-1. The crown is unworn and complete and there are no roots, suggesting that the tooth had not yet erupted when its owner died. Krause, who first described the tooth in 1993, identified it as a right molar, but the subsequent discovery of the jaw of &quot;Sudamerica&quot; made it clear that &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; molariforms had been reversed, and MLP 88-III-28-1 is actually from the left side of the jaw. The tooth is 2.2 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. The crown is roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. The lingual row consists of four cusps, which are smaller and lower than the three labial ones. The cusps in this row become smaller and lower from the front to the back. Two ridges descend from the tip of each cusp to the lingual and labial sides. The labial ridges on the first and fourth cusp only reach the base of the cusp, but those on the second and third cusps join ridges descending from the first and second labial cusp. In the first three cusps, the lingual ridge extends to near the lingual margin of the tooth and then turns backward; the end of the ridge is lingual to the next cusp. In the fourth cusp, the ridge hardly extends posteriorly, but rather labially, forming the posterior margin of the tooth and joining a ridge descending from the last labial cusp. The labial cusp row includes three, larger cusps, each of which bears two ridges that descend lingually into the valley between the two cusp rows. The front ridge of each pair ends in the central valley, and the back ridge joins a ridge from a lingual cusp. The ridge pattern results in the presence of three transverse furrows between the main cusps.

Another mf1, MACN Pv-RN 253, is almost unworn, but damaged: only the front two lingual cusps and the first two cusps and part of the third in the labial row are preserved. This tooth is similar to MLP 88-III-28-1 in all respects. However, Gurovich suggests that it may also be an m2. MACN Pv-RN 174, which is heavily worn, and MACN Pv-RN 175, which is not only heavily worn but has also undergone severe abrasion, were originally identified as upper molars of &quot;Vucetichia gracilis&quot; by Bonaparte in 1990. The roots of MACN Pv-RN 174 are preserved; at the front and back of the tooth, there is a pair of roots, which are fused near their bases. It has small enamel prisms. Krause and colleagues suggested in 1992 that 174 and 175 were mf1s of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; on the basis of similarities with 253, and Krause confirmed this in 1993 by describing the complete mf1 MLP 88-III-28-1. The related ferugliotheriid genus &quot;Trapalcotherium&quot; is known from a single mf1, which is similar to &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; mf1s but different in some morphological details (see &quot;Trapalcotherium&quot;: Relationships).

The holotype, MACN Pv-RN 20, is a right mf2 according to both Krause and colleagues (1992) and Gurovich (2005), but Gurovich considered the side that Krause and colleagues thought was lingual to be labial, and vice versa. The latter interpretation is used in the following description. It is almost square, but at the front it is slightly narrower than at the back. The labial side of the tooth is taller and less worn than the lingual side. There are two rows of cusps, and each lingual cusp is connected to each labial cusp by a broad crest, with one or more fossas in the middle. One of the two labial cusps may have been divided into two smaller cusps. The two crests are separated by a deep furrow. The enamel prisms of this tooth are small, like those of the premolar MACN Pv-RN 250.

Transverse ridges between the cusps, as seen in &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, are known in only one multituberculate, &quot;Essonodon&quot;, but the ridge pattern in &quot;Essonodon&quot; is more complicated and the animal lacks the prominent furrows of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and differs in numerous other features. On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;, &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot;, and &quot;Sudamerica&quot;, indicating that the three are closely related.

===Upper molariforms===
A single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 248, is currently identified as a &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; upper molariform. In 1992, Krause and colleagues labeled it as a right MF1, but Gurovich identifies it as a left MF1 or possibly even a right mf1. LACM 149371, an enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Santa Rosa, Peru, may represent an upper molar of an animal related to &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot;. Like the latter, it has cusps that are compressed from front to back and that are connected to the center of the crown by low crests.

MACN Pv-RN 248 is somewhat damaged and almost rectangular, but slightly narrower at the back than at the front. The tooth bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. The middle row consists of five cusps, the labial row (assuming it is a left M1; if it is from the right, &quot;lingual&quot; and &quot;labial&quot; should be reversed) includes two or perhaps three cusps, and the lingual row includes probably four cusps. The lingual and middle rows extend across the entire length of the tooth, but the labial row is shorter, extending across about 70% of the length. The middle row is oriented obliquely with respect to the length axis of the tooth, so that it converges with the lingual row towards the back of the tooth. The front lingual corner of the tooth is missing, but it appears that the first cusps in the lingual and middle rows are connected by two ridges, one at the front margin of the tooth and one at the back of the cusps. A deep fossa (basin) lies between the two cusps and their connecting ridges. Behind these two cusps, a transverse furrow extends across the width of the tooth. The second lingual and middle cusps are also connected by a crest, which is somewhat weaker than those connecting the first cusps. Another transverse furrow extends behind the second cusps and also separates the second middle cusp from the labial row. A third furrow, behind the third lingual and middle cusps, also separates the first from the second labial cusp. Three ridges descend from the fourth lingual cusp: one connects to the fourth middle cusp, one ends blindly between the fourth lingual and middle cusps, and one connects to the fifth middle cusp. The second labial cusp, which is larger than the first one, is superficially divided into two smaller cusps by an indentation on its lingual side. There are vertical grooves at the bases of the cusps.

==Range and ecology==
Remains of &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; come from two formations in the Late Cretaceous of southern Argentina, the Los Alamitos and La Colonia Formations. These and the Allen Formation (which has yielded &quot;Trapalcotherium&quot;) are all dated to the Campanian (84–71 million years ago) and/or Maastrichtian (71–66 million years ago), the penultimate and ultimate stages of the Cretaceous. The La Colonia Formation may be somewhat younger than the other two, while the Los Alamitos Formation has been considered Campanian, and can be dated to the Campanian or Maastrichtian on the basis of palynology. The Allen Formation is likely Maastrichtian, but not latest Maastrichtian.

The Los Alamitos Formation is located in southeastern Río Negro Province, in the vicinity of the town of Cona Niyeu and was probably deposited in a marshy environment. In 1983, it yielded the first Mesozoic mammal to be found in Argentina, &quot;Mesungulatum houssayi&quot;, and since then, the mammalian fauna has expanded to 14 species. Most of those belong to the archaic mammalian group Dryolestoidea, but the fauna also includes the gondwanatheres &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; and &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot;. The dryolestoids &quot;Mesungulatum houssayi&quot; and &quot;Groebertherium novasi&quot; and the two gondwanatheres are the most common mammals. Other fossils found in the Los Alamitos Formation include fish, frogs, turtles, madtsoiid snakes, dinosaurs such as &quot;Secernosaurus&quot;, gastropods, and other invertebrates.

The La Colonia Formation outcrops in north-central Chubut Province, and the mammalian fossils come from the Mirasol Chico valley. The formation includes fluvial (river), deep-sea, and near-shore deposits, and the mammalian fauna probably comes from an estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain. The La Colonia Formation also contains dryolestoids, such as &quot;Coloniatherium&quot; and &quot;Reigitherium&quot;, as well as a ferugliotheriid and the putative multituberculate &quot;Argentodites&quot;. In addition, the La Colonia Formation has yielded fossils of a wide array of other animals, including crocodiles, plesiosaurs, lungfish (&quot;Ceratodus&quot;), and dinosaurs (including &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;).

The high-crowned sudamericids were probably herbivores, but the lower-crowned &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; was more probably an insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as &quot;Mesodma&quot;, which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or slicing, and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for slicing hard plant parts, such as seeds. The wear patterns on &quot;Ferugliotherium&quot; teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.

<text>Wardriving is the act of searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks as well as cell towers, usually from a moving vehicle, using a laptop or smartphone. Software for wardriving is freely available on the internet.

Warbiking, warcycling, warwalking and similar use the same approach but with other modes of transportation.

== Etymology ==
&quot;War driving&quot; originated from wardialing, a method popularized by a character played by Matthew Broderick in the film &quot;WarGames&quot;, and named after that film. War dialing consists of dialing every phone number in a specific sequence in search of modems.

==Variants==
&quot;Warbiking&quot; or &quot;warcycling&quot; is similar to wardriving, but is done from a moving bicycle or motorcycle. This practice is sometimes facilitated by mounting a Wi-Fi enabled device on the vehicle.

&quot;Warwalking&quot;, or &quot;warjogging&quot;, is similar to wardriving, but is done on foot rather than from a moving vehicle. The disadvantages of this method are a slower speed of travel (leading to the discovery of more infrequently discovered networks) and the absence of a convenient computing environment. Consequently, handheld devices such as pocket computers, which can perform such tasks while users are walking or standing, have dominated this practice. Technology advances and developments in the early 2000s expanded the extent of this practice. Advances include computers with integrated Wi-Fi, rather than CompactFlash (CF) or PC Card (PCMCIA) add-in cards in computers such as Dell Axim, Compaq iPAQ and Toshiba pocket computers starting in 2002. Later, the active Nintendo DS and Sony PSP enthusiast communities gained Wi-Fi abilities on these devices. Further, nearly all modern smartphones integrate Wi-Fi and Global Positioning System (GPS).

&quot;Warrailing&quot;, or &quot;Wartraining&quot;, is similar to wardriving, but is done on a train or tram rather than from a slower more controllable vehicle. The disadvantages of this method are higher speed of travel (resulting in less discovery of more infrequently discovered networks) and often limited to major roads with higher traffic.

&quot;Warkitting&quot; is a combination of wardriving and rootkitting. In a warkitting attack, a hacker replaces the firmware of an attacked router. This allows them to control all traffic for the victim, and could even permit them to disable TLS by replacing HTML content as it is being downloaded. Warkitting was identified by Tsow, Jakobsson, Yang, and Wetzel.

&quot;Warflying&quot; is a variant utilizing aircraft flying around and locating nodes. It was first performed in Perth with a Grumman Tiger in August 2002, and a week later in San Diego in August 2002 in a Cessna 182.

== Mapping ==

Wardrivers use a Wi-Fi-equipped device together with a GPS device to record the location of wireless networks. The results can then be uploaded to websites like WiGLE, or Geomena where the data is processed to form maps of the network neighborhood. There are also clients available for smartphones running Android that can upload data directly. For better range and sensitivity, antennas are built or bought, and vary from omnidirectional to highly directional.

The maps of known network IDs can then be used as a geolocation system—an alternative to GPS—by triangulating the current position from the signal strengths of known network IDs. Examples include Place Lab by Intel, Skyhook, Navizon by Cyril Houri, SeekerLocate from Seeker Wireless, and Geomena. Navizon and combines information from Wi-Fi and cell phone tower maps contributed by users from Wi-Fi-equipped cell phones. In addition to location finding, this provides navigation information, and allows for the tracking of the position of friends, and geotagging.

In December 2004, a class of 100 undergraduates worked to map the city of Seattle, Washington over several weeks. They found 5,225 access points; 44% were secured with WEP encryption, 52% were open, and 3% were pay-for-access. They noticed trends in the frequency and security of the networks depending on location. Many of the open networks were clearly intended to be used by the general public, with network names like &quot;Open to share, no porn please&quot; or &quot;Free access, be nice.&quot; The information was collected into high-resolution maps, which were published online. Previous efforts had mapped cities such as Dublin.

== Legal and ethical considerations ==
Some portray wardriving as a questionable practice (typically from its association with piggybacking), though, from a technical viewpoint, everything is working as designed: many access points broadcast identifying data accessible to anyone with a suitable receiver. It could be compared to making a map of a neighborhood&#x27;s house numbers and mail box labels.

While some may claim that wardriving is illegal, there are no laws that specifically prohibit or allow wardriving, though many localities have laws forbidding unauthorized access of computer networks and protecting personal privacy. Google created a privacy storm in some countries after it eventually admitted systematically but surreptitiously gathering Wi-Fi data while capturing video footage and mapping data for its Street View service. It has since been using Android-based mobile devices to gather this data.

Passive, listen-only wardriving (with programs like Kismet or KisMAC) does not communicate at all with the networks, merely logging broadcast addresses. This can be likened to listening to a radio station that happens to be broadcasting in the area or with other forms of DXing.

With other types of software, such as NetStumbler, the wardriver actively sends probe messages, and the access point responds per design. The legality of active wardriving is less certain, since the wardriver temporarily becomes &quot;associated&quot; with the network, even though no data is transferred. Most access points, when using default &quot;out of the box&quot; security settings, are intended to provide wireless access to all who request it. The war driver&#x27;s liability may be reduced by setting the computer to a static IP, instead of using DHCP, preventing the network from granting the computer an IP address or logging the connection.

In the United States, the case that is usually referenced in determining whether a network has been &quot;accessed&quot; is &quot;State v. Allen&quot;. In this case, Allen had been wardialing in an attempt to get free long-distance calling through Southwestern Bell&#x27;s computer systems. When presented with a password protection screen, however, he did not attempt to bypass it. The court ruled that although he had &quot;contacted&quot; or &quot;approached&quot; the computer system, this did not constitute &quot;access&quot; of the company&#x27;s network.

There are also homebrew wardriving applications for handheld game consoles that support Wi-Fi, such as sniff for the Nintendo DS/Android, Road Dog for the Sony PSP, WiFi-Where for the iPhone, G-MoN, Wardrive, Wigle Wifi for Android, and WlanPollution for Symbian NokiaS60 devices. There also exists a mode within &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&quot; for the Sony PSP (wherein the player is able to find new comrades by searching for wireless access points) which can be used to wardrive. &quot;Treasure World&quot; for the DS is a commercial game in which gameplay wholly revolves around wardriving.

<doc id="216722" wikidata="Q3290521" url="?curid=216722" title="Biblical conspiracy theory">
<text>Biblical conspiracy theories posit that much of what is believed about the Bible is a deception created to suppress a secret or ancient truth. Such conspiracy theories may claim that Jesus really had a wife and children, or that a group such as the Priory of Sion has secret information about the true descendants of Jesus; some claim that there was a secret movement to censor books that truly belonged in the Bible, etc.

This subject should not be confused with deliberately fictional Bible conspiracy theories. A number of bestselling modern novels, the most popular of which was &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, have incorporated elements of Bible conspiracy theories to flesh out their storylines, rather than to push these theories as actual suggestions.

==Common theories==

===Jesus-myth theory===

Some proponents of the Jesus-myth or Christ-myth theory consider that the whole of Christianity is a conspiracy. American author Acharya S (Dorothy Murdock) in &quot;The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold&quot; (1999) argues that Jesus and Christianity were created by members of various secret societies, mystery schools, and religions, that these people drew on numerous myths and rituals which existed previously, and that the church then constructed these ideas into Christianity by suppressing the originally intended understanding. In the 1930s British spiritualist Hannen Swaffer&#x27;s home circle, following the teachings of the native-American spirit &quot;Silver Birch&quot;, also claimed a Jesus-myth.

===Church suppression of reincarnation conspiracy===
Some New Age believers consider that Jesus taught reincarnation but the Christian Church suppressed it. Geddes MacGregor in &quot;Reincarnation in Christianity&quot; (1978) suggests that Origen&#x27;s texts written in support of the belief in reincarnation somehow disappeared or were suppressed.

===Jesus, Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail===
Some common hypotheses are that:
* Mary Magdalene was one of the apostles of Jesus, possibly even the only disciple, but this was suppressed by the early Church.
* Jesus had an intimate relationship with Mary Magdalene which may or may not have resulted in marriage or children; their continued bloodline is then said to be Christianity&#x27;s deepest secret.
&quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;, by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln (1982) is seen by many as the source of that plotline in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.

===Resurrected Jesus as an impostor===

&quot;The Gospel of Afranius&quot;, an atheistic Russian work that came out in English in 2022, proposes politically motivated gaslighting as the origin of the foundational Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus.

<doc id="216731" wikidata="Q2915050" url="?curid=216731" title="Tawfiq al-Suwaidi">
<text>Tawfiq al-Suwaidi (; 11 May 1892 – 15 October 1968) was an Iraqi politician who served as Prime Minister of Iraq on three occasions stretching from 1929 to 1950.

==Early life and education==
Al-Suwaidi was born in Baghdad in 1892, he completed his early schooling at 16 and after a year in the local law college, travelled to Istanbul in 1909 where he continued his studies in the Istanbul College of Law. After completing his studies in Istanbul (graduation 1912) Tawfiq al-Suwaidi&#x27;s was sent to the Sorbonne in Paris, by his father, to further his Law education. Al - Suwaidi returned to Iraq after finishing his studies in Paris in 1914. He joined the Ministry of Education as a secretary to the committee for the renovation of Shamsuddin Sami&#x27;s famous French-Turkish Dictionary.

==Career==
During the first world war, as well as working as a lawyer, Al -Suwaidi worked as a teacher in the Law college in Damascus, teaching Roman and general international law. He accepted these posts after rejecting a judgeship in Dair al - Zor and resigning from a judgeship in Damascus - al-Suwaidi was adamant to take a professional salary paying position rather than a position of prestige in order to repay his father for his European education.

It was in 1928, upon the resignation of the Saadan ministry, that Tawfik al- Sowaidi was appointed premier and called to form his first cabinet. He thus became the youngest premier in Iraq&#x27;s history.

Iraq was granted membership to the League of Nations in 1932 and due to his fluency in foreign languages, particularly French, the then diplomatic language, Tawfiq al-suwaidi was chosen as Iraq&#x27;s first permanent representative.

In addition to serving as prime minister, Al-Suwaidi also held posts as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice, the Controller general of state accounts; and separate from his ministerial roles, al-Suwaidi served as a member of the regency council (performing the duties of king or regent at times in which they were absent from the country), a leader of the Iraqi delegation to the league of nations and a leader of the delegation to the united nations. He was elected as the president of the Chamber of Deputies from November 1929 to November 1930.

He was Governor of the Central Bank of Iraq from 1948 to 1949.

In 1958, Tawfiq al-Suwaidi was selected as the Foreign affairs minister under Arab Federation. However, this post was dissolved when the royal regime fell by the 14 July Revolution.

Because of his close ties to the crown, Suwaidi was arrested in 1958 during the revolution that overthrew the monarchy. Sentenced to life in prison, he was pardoned in 1961 and went into exile in Lebanon, where he died.
