==History==
In the Edo period, Tochigi prospered from its location on the Uzumagawa River, which connected with the Tone River to Edo. Envoys using the &quot;Reiheishi Way&quot; sent from the Imperial Court going to Shrines and Temples of Nikkō stayed at the lodging area in the city. Most of the area was formerly &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate; however, the minor feudal domain of Fukiake Domain was located within the borders of modern city of Tochigi.

Following the Meiji Restoration and the creation of Tochigi Prefecture, Tochigi Town was the prefectural capital from 1871 until its relocation to Utsunomiya in 1884. On April 1, 1937, Tochigi was elevated to city status.

On September 30, 1954, Tochigi absorbed the villages of Ōmiya, Minagawa, Fukiage, and Terao (all from Shimotsuga District). This was followed by the village of Kōō (from Shimotsuga District) on March 31, 1957.
Tochigi hosted its first film festival, the &quot;Kuranomachikado&quot;, or, &quot;Eizo Film Festival&quot; from October 5, 2007, to October 8, 2007.

On March 29, 2010, Tochigi absorbed the towns of Fujioka, Ōhira and Tsuga (Shimotsuga District). This was followed by the town of Nishikata (from Kamitsuga District) on October 1, 2011, and the town of Iwafune (from Shimotsuga District) on April 5, 2014.

<doc id="222767" wikidata="Q752431" url="?curid=222767" title="New Hebrides">
<text>New Hebrides, officially the New Hebrides Condominium () and named after the Hebrides in Scotland, was the colonial name for the island group in the South Pacific Ocean that is now Vanuatu. Native people had inhabited the islands for three thousand years before the first Europeans arrived in 1606 from a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queirós. The islands were named by Captain James Cook in 1774 and subsequently colonised by both the British and the French.

The two countries eventually signed an agreement making the islands an Anglo-French condominium that provided for joint sovereignty over the archipelago with two parallel administrations, one British, one French. In some respects, that divide continued even after independence, with schools teaching in either one language or the other. The condominium lasted from 1906 until 1980, when New Hebrides gained its independence as the Republic of Vanuatu.

== Politics and economy ==
The New Hebrides was a rare form of colonial territory in which sovereignty was shared by two powers, Britain and France, instead of being exercised by just one. Under the condominium there were three separate governments – one French, one British, and one joint administration that was partially elected after 1975, when elections to the New Hebrides Condominium Representative Assembly took place. 

The French and British governments were called residencies, each headed by a resident appointed by the metropolitan government. The residency structure greatly emphasised dualism, with both consisting of an equal number of French and British representatives, bureaucrats and administrators. Every member of one residency always had an exact mirror opposite number on the other side whom they could consult. The symmetry between the two residencies was almost exact.

The joint government consisted of both local and European officials. It had jurisdiction over the postal service, public radio station, public works, infrastructure, and censuses, among other things. The two main towns of Luganville and Port Vila also had town councils, but these did not have a great deal of authority.

While initial settlers were predominantly British living in Australia, the late 19th century saw an influx of French. Within a few decades, there were twice as many French on the islands as there were British, prompting a multitude of petitions to cede power to either the French or the British. Despite this, the two nations came together to form a condominium, a specialised form of government where both nations would have all of their own administrations and jointly rule the islands. The only place they came together was in the Joint Court. As Mander describes, &quot;The Joint Court was the key to the situation and much was to depend upon it….Three judges–one British, one French, and the third nominated by the King of Spain–were to comprise the court.&quot; This meant convictions in court were chosen based on either British or French law, depending on the circumstances.

Other than the Joint Court, everything existed in pairs. &quot;Cynics called the Condominium &#x27;the Pandemonium&#x27;, as the dual administration produced amazing duplication. There were two police forces with their own laws, including road laws, two health services, two education systems, two currencies, and two prison systems.&quot; Additionally, there were separate British and French governments, which meant two immigration policies, two courts (apart from the Joint Court), and two corporation laws. Inhabitants of the islands were given the choice of which government they wanted to be ruled by. As Miles put it, &quot;The result was an inevitable clash of foreign policy and colonial mentality.&quot;

Local people could choose whether to be tried under the English common law or the French civil law. Visitors could choose which immigration rules to enter under. Nationals of one country could set up corporations under the laws of the other. In addition to these two legal systems, a third Native Court existed to handle cases involving Melanesian customary law. There was also a Joint Court, composed of British and French judges. The President of the Joint Court was appointed by the King of Spain until 1939 when the post was abolished after the retirement of the last President, partly due to the abolition of the Spanish monarchy in 1931.

There were two prison systems to complement the two court systems. The police force was technically unified but consisted of two chiefs and two equal groups of officers wearing two different uniforms. Each group alternated duties and assignments.

Language was a serious barrier to the operation of the naturally inefficient system, as all documents had to be translated once to be understood by one side, then the response translated again to be understood by the other, though Bislama creole represented an informal bridge between the British and the French camps.

The condominium was not beneficial for Ni-Vanuatu, as they were &quot;...officially stateless. [For instance,] To travel abroad, they needed an identifying document signed by both the British and the French resident commissioners.&quot; Inevitably, that led to discontent across the islands, with a multitude of revolutionary groups forming in an attempt to create agency and self-government for themselves.

During the Second World War, approximately 10,000 Ni-Vanuatu men served in the Vanuatu Labor Corps, a labor battalion of the United States Armed Forces. They provided logistical support to the Allied war effort during the Guadalcanal Campaign. The mass participation of Ni-Vanuatu men in the Labor Corps had a significant effect on the John Frum movement, giving it the characteristics of a cargo cult.

== Self-government ==
New Hebrides became internally self-governing in January 1978.

<doc id="222771" wikidata="Q25275" url="?curid=222771" title="ISO 3166-1">
<text>ISO 3166-1 (&quot;Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions – Part 1: Country code&quot;) is a standard defining codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest. It is the first part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization.

It defines three sets of country codes:
* ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 – two-letter country codes which are used most prominently for the Internet&#x27;s country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions).
* ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 – three-letter country codes which allow a better visual association between the codes and the country names than the alpha-2 codes.
* ISO 3166-1 numeric – three-digit country codes which are identical to those developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, with the advantage of script (writing system) independence, and hence useful for people or systems using non-Latin scripts.

The alphabetic country codes were first included in ISO 3166 in 1974, and the numeric country codes were first included in 1981. The country codes have been published as ISO 3166-1 since 1997, when ISO 3166 was expanded into three parts, with ISO 3166-2 defining codes for subdivisions and ISO 3166-3 defining codes for former countries.

As a widely used international standard, ISO 3166-1 is implemented in other standards and used by international organizations to allow facilitation of the exchange of goods and information. However, it is not the only standard for country codes. Other country codes used by many international organizations are partly or totally incompatible with ISO 3166-1, although some of them closely correspond to ISO 3166-1 codes.

==Criteria for inclusion==

Codes for 249 countries, territories, or areas of geographical interest are assigned in ISO 3166-1. According to the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA), the only way to enter a new country name into ISO 3166-1 is to have it registered in one of the following two sources:
* United Nations Terminology Bulletin &quot;Country Names&quot;, or
* &quot;Country and Region Codes for Statistical Use&quot; of the United Nations Statistics Division.

To be listed in the bulletin &quot;Country Names&quot;, a country must be at least one of the following:

* A member state of the United Nations
* A member of one of its specialized agencies
* A party to the &quot;Statute of the International Court of Justice&quot;

The list of names in &quot;Country and Region Codes for Statistical Use&quot; of the UN Statistics Division is based on the bulletin &quot;Country Names&quot; and other UN sources.

Once a country name or territory name appears in either of these two sources, it will be added to ISO 3166-1 by default.

The ISO 3166/MA may reserve code elements for other entities that do not qualify for inclusion based on the above criteria. For example, because the European Union is not a country, it is not formally included in ISO 3166-1, but for practical reasons, the ISO 3166/MA has &quot;reserved the two-letter combination for the purpose of identifying the European Union within the framework of ISO 3166-1&quot;.

==Information included==

ISO 3166-1 is published officially in both English and French. Since the second edition of ISO 3166-1, the following columns are included for each entry:
# Country Name – English (or French) short name (all upper-case)
# English (or French) short name lower case (title case)
# English (or French) full name
# Alpha-2 code
# Alpha-3 code
# Numeric code
# Remarks
# Independent
# Additional information: Administrative language(s) alpha-2 code element(s)
# Additional information: Administrative language(s) alpha-3 code element(s)
# Additional information: Local short name(s)

==Naming and code construction==
===Naming and disputes===
The country names used in ISO 3166-1 are taken from the two UN sources. Some country names used by the UN, and accordingly by ISO, are disputed:


===Coding===

The codes are chosen, according to the ISO 3166/MA, &quot;to reflect the significant, unique component of the country name in order to allow a visual association between country name and country code&quot;. For this reason, common components of country names like &quot;Republic&quot;, &quot;Kingdom&quot;, &quot;United&quot;, &quot;Federal&quot; or &quot;Democratic&quot; are normally not used for deriving the code elements. As a consequence, for example, the United Kingdom is officially assigned the alpha-2 code rather than , based on its official name &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; (although is reserved on the request of the United Kingdom). Some codes are chosen based on the native names of the countries. For example, Germany is assigned the alpha-2 code , based on its native name &quot;Deutschland&quot;.

==Codes==
The complete ISO 3166-1 list of countries and their assigned codes, listed in alphabetical order by the country&#x27;s English short name used by the ISO 3166/MA:

&quot;Each country&#x27;s alpha-2 code is linked to more information about the assignment of its code elements.&quot;

===Reserved and user-assigned code elements===
The officially assigned code elements may be expanded by using either reserved codes or user-assigned codes.

Reserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, are used in other coding systems such as WIPO ST.3, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes for a certain use for a limited or indeterminate period of time. Codes are usually reserved for former countries, overseas territories, international organizations, and special nationality status. The reserved alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes can be divided into three categories:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;(follow the links for the reserved codes of each category)&quot;
* Alpha-2: exceptional reservations, transitional reservations, and indeterminate reservations
* Alpha-3: exceptional reservations, transitional reservations, and indeterminate reservations
* Numeric: no reserved codes

User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes when updating the standard. These codes can be user-assigned:
* Alpha-2: , to , to , and 
* Alpha-3: to , to , to , and to 
* Numeric: to 

====User-assigned codes in wide use====

* : Used to denote Northern Ireland for the purposes of VAT collection in trade between it and the European Union.

==Changes==

The ISO 3166/MA updates ISO 3166-1 when necessary. A country is normally assigned new ISO 3166-1 codes if it changes its name or its territorial boundaries. In general, new alphabetic codes are assigned if a country changes a significant part of its name, while a new numeric code is assigned if a country changes its territorial boundaries. Codes for country names that have been deleted from ISO 3166-1 are published in ISO 3166-3.

ISO formerly announced changes in newsletters which updated the standard, and periodically released new editions which consolidated the newsletter changes. As of July 2013, changes are published in the online catalogue of ISO only, and newsletters are no longer published. Past newsletters remain available via the search option on the ISO website.

<doc id="222775" wikidata="Q493955" url="?curid=222775" title="The Lodge, Australia">
<text>The Lodge is the primary official residence of the prime minister of Australia. Located at 5 Adelaide Avenue in the Canberra suburb of Deakin, it is situated a short distance away from Parliament House. The Lodge is one of two official prime ministerial residences, the secondary official residence being Kirribilli House in Sydney. The building was completed in 1927 in the Georgian revival style, since then twenty-three people have served as prime minister, six of whom chose to live elsewhere either full- or part-time during their tenure, and two who chose to live at Kirribilli House.

==History==

The Lodge is a 40-room Australian Georgian revival style mansion, located on 18,000 square metres (4.4 acres) of landscaped grounds. The origin of its name is unknown. It was built as a temporary measure, to be occupied by whoever was the prime minister &quot;until such time as a monumental prime minister&#x27;s residence is constructed, and thereafter to be used for other purposes&quot;. The original &quot;prime minister&#x27;s cottage&quot; was built in 1926–1927 at a base cost of £25,000 and an eventual total of &quot;£28,319 (approximately $2,298,825 AUD in 2020), including the landscaping of 2.8 hectares of grounds, construction of a tennis court and croquet lawn, and furnishing and interior decoration&quot;. The architects were Percy A. Oakley and Stanley T. Parkes of Melbourne; the builder was J. G. Taylor of Sydney. Ruth Lane Poole of Melbourne was responsible for interior design and furnishing, as she had been for the governor-general&#x27;s residence, Government House. The Lodge was intended as one of a set of three official residences, the others to be for the presiding officers of the Parliament of Australia (the speaker of the House of Representatives and the president of the Senate), but the others were never built.

The first prime minister to live in the Lodge was Stanley Bruce. He and his wife Ethel (they had no children) moved in on 4 May 1927, five days before the official opening of the Provisional Parliament House on 9 May. When he was leader of the opposition, Bruce&#x27;s successor James Scullin (1929–32) had objected to the cost of running the Lodge and, true to his word, he and his wife lived at the Hotel Canberra (now the Hyatt Hotel) during his premiership. However the next prime minister, Joseph Lyons, chose the Lodge, and all subsequent prime ministers have used it as their primary place of residence, except for:
*Earle Page (1939), Frank Forde (1945), and John McEwen (1967–68), who served as caretaker prime ministers following the deaths of an incumbent.
*Ben Chifley (1945–49), who preferred the Hotel Kurrajong, where many Labor politicians of the era stayed.
*John Howard (1996–2007), who stayed at the Lodge when he was in Canberra for parliamentary or government business, but lived primarily at Kirribilli House, Sydney. The latter is a residence maintained for the official use of prime ministers when they need to perform official duties and extend official hospitality in Sydney.
*Tony Abbott (2013–2015), who served as the prime minister while the Lodge was being renovated. Abbott resided at an apartment at the Australian Federal Police training college when in Canberra.
*Scott Morrison (2018–2022), who stayed at the Lodge when he was in Canberra for parliamentary or government business, but lived primarily at Kirribilli House, Sydney. Morrison stated that this was to ensure that his daughters could continue to &#x27;live as normal a life as is possible&#x27;.

When Julia Gillard became Prime Minister on 24 June 2010 after the parliamentary Labor Party decided to replace Kevin Rudd as leader, she declared that she would not move into the Lodge until she had &quot;fulsomely earned the trust of the Australian people to be prime minister&quot; at an election; instead, she remained living in her home in Altona in Melbourne and her flat in Canberra. Following the 2010 election at which Gillard led her party into minority government, she moved into The Lodge on 26 September 2010.

Of the three Australian prime ministers who have died in office, the only one to die at The Lodge was John Curtin in 1945.

===Earlier prime ministers&#x27; residences===
Melbourne served as the temporary capital from 1901 to 1927. During this time, there was no official residence for the prime minister. Edmund Barton, the first prime minister, initially lived in &quot;a kind of bachelor flat&quot; in the attic of Parliament House, Melbourne. This was remembered by James Drake as like a turret, &quot;comfortably furnished as a writing room, and it opened into an equally small sleeping apartment with a bathroom adjoining&quot;. He retained a private residence in Sydney: &#x27;Miandetta&#x27; at 67 Carabella Street, Kirribilli, from 1896 to 1906, and usually returned there when parliament was not in session. In May 1903 he instead moved into a suite at the Grand Hotel, which remained his residence until his resignation in September 1903. The second prime minister, Alfred Deakin, was a Melburnian and lived at his private residence &quot;Llanarth&quot; in South Yarra during each of his three terms as prime minister. He also had a vacation house, &quot;Ballara&quot;, at Point Lonsdale. However, Deakin drew a distinction between his public and private lives and did not conduct official business at either of his homes. Chris Watson and George Reid both had their ordinary residences in Sydney, and stayed in boarding houses with other MPs during their short periods as prime minister; Watson&#x27;s was in East Melbourne and Reid&#x27;s was in St Kilda.

Andrew Fisher, who represented a Queensland seat, was the first non-Victorian prime minister to live permanently in the capital. In 1907 he purchased &quot;Oakleigh Hall&quot;, a 13-room mansion in St Kilda East with of gardens. He and his extended family and servants used it as their residence during his three terms as prime minister beginning in 1908 and 1915. He frequently received guests and conducted official business there, but was given no allowance for its upkeep. Joseph Cook and Billy Hughes lived primarily in Sydney, but Stanley Bruce was another Melburnian and resumed the tradition of prime ministers residing in the capital year-round. In 1926, the year before The Lodge was finished, Bruce built &quot;Pine Hill&quot;, a 16-room mansion in Frankston.

==Description==
The building&#x27;s interior has an American Colonial character, with stained wall panelling and exposed upper-floor beams under the ceiling. The ground-floor entrance opens into an entrance hall. To the left of the entrance is the dining room and service wing, which includes staff quarters. To its right are the formal reception rooms—a drawing room, study, and sitting room/library (which was originally intended as a billiards room). The staircase rises to a landing which contains office space for the prime minister&#x27;s spouse, then divides into two flights, leading to a hall opening onto a loggia above the entrance. On the first floor are the private apartments and guest accommodation, consisting of a study, six bedrooms, sitting room, a drawing room, and a billiards/games room.

==Renovations==
===Menzies, 1939===

In 1939 Robert Menzies&#x27; wife Pattie supervised a major refurbishment. The makeshift children&#x27;s bedrooms on the front balcony, built for the large Lyons family, were removed. Worn carpets and furnishings were replaced and kerosene heaters installed.

===Holt, 1966===
Harold Holt&#x27;s wife Zara Holt also organised a major makeover. All the curtains and carpets were discarded. The floors were re-covered with a dramatic emerald green carpet. The tall, arched windows of the entrance were draped with crisp white curtains. A flagpole flying the Australian flag was installed on the stair landing. Most controversial of all was the extensive work needed to transform the dark varnished Tasmanian mountain ash panelling of the walls of all three rooms. Once the stripping was completed, the walls were coated with a white gloss paint. These bright walls remained the backdrop of formal photographs at The Lodge for the next five prime ministers.

===Gorton, 1968===
John Gorton&#x27;s wife Bettina had practical skills in farm repairs which were soon called on to deal with maintenance issues resulting from some of Zara Holt&#x27;s decorating shortcomings. Repairs to a leaking ceiling that threatened the silk wallpaper in the &#x27;Swan Suite&#x27;, and toning down some of the more vibrant colours in furnishings and finishes, were among the tasks she undertook. But Bettina Gorton&#x27;s lasting imprint on The Lodge was in the grounds. During the Gortons&#x27; tenure, a wall was built surrounding The Lodge, both as a security measure and to give some privacy from the encroaching traffic of Adelaide Avenue on the eastern side of the residence. Once the wall was completed, Bettina Gorton developed a garden of Australian native plants. The Gortons also installed a swimming pool and a courtyard in the north-east corner of the grounds.

===Fraser, 1977–78===
Major work was carried out in 1977–78 to upgrade the kitchen and staff quarters and to extend the main dining room. The Frasers found the house drab and unwelcoming. The once-glamorous wallpaper was peeling from the guestroom ceiling, and numerous cracks had appeared in the bathroom walls. Tamie Fraser thought the layout of the house was inefficient, the service area inadequate and, like every occupant since 1927, found the dining room too small for adequate official entertaining. Among the visitors entertained at The Lodge by the Frasers were the Prince of Wales, and then Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in 1977.

The first task Tamie Fraser undertook was to supplement the surviving settings of the 1927 white and gold Royal Doulton dinner service. It had a special pattern that had been designed by Ruth Lane Poole in 1926 featuring the prime-ministerial monogram (consisting of the interwoven letters &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;M&#x27;), which also appears carved into the backs of the dining-room chairs. The man who handled Tamie Fraser&#x27;s order in 1977 had arranged for the manufacture of the original set fifty years earlier. Though this expensive purchase created a furore, it did not deter Tamie Fraser from battling to secure major renovations of the service wing and dining room in 1978. She chose architect Guilford Bell to oversee this remodelling and to redecorate the main reception rooms to &#x27;classic colours and style&#x27;, with cream-painted walls and a white Berber carpet.

===Hawke, 1987===
The most notable feature of the work done by Hawke&#x27;s wife Hazel during her eight years at The Lodge was her sympathetic restoration of the building&#x27;s interior. She also supported The Australiana Fund, started by Tamie Fraser, which used donations to collect Australian art and furniture for the four official residences – Government House and The Lodge in Canberra, and Admiralty House and Kirribilli House in Sydney. Hazel Hawke found and arranged restoration of The Lodge&#x27;s original Australian-made Beale Piano. The piano, chosen for The Lodge by Ruth Lane Poole to fit the original designs for the drawing room, had been used in the Canberra School of Music as a practice piano after its removal from The Lodge. Mrs Hawke also fitted out a room on the mezzanine landing of The Lodge as her office, which she remembered as her favourite room in which she spent most of her time.

===Keating, 1991===
The Keatings made some changes to the furnishings, moving a massive William Rojo bookcase provided by the Australiana Fund into storage and providing the &#x27;Brown Room&#x27; with new sofas. Unlike many of the earlier prime-ministerial families, the Keatings preferred to treat The Lodge as a family home and did not often entertain official visitors there.

===Howard, 1996===
Although the Howards chose to reside at Kirribilli House in Sydney, they used The Lodge for official purposes and made significant changes. From 2000 to 2005, the reception areas of the residence were progressively refurbished with the assistance of interior designer Mary Durack. The two main reception rooms, the Morning Room and the Drawing Room, were redecorated in a complementary theme rather than as two distinctive areas, as was previously the case. The dining room and the foyer were also refurbished.

===Major refurbishment, 2011–2015===
Howard&#x27;s successor in 2007, Kevin Rudd, returned to tradition by living at The Lodge, as did his successor Julia Gillard.

In October 2011 the Department of Finance and Deregulation had announced an intended 18-month repair and refurbishment project, involving roofing, insulation, guttering, plumbing, removal of hazardous material, heating and cooling, electrical rewiring, and replacement of the Australian Federal Police guard houses. &quot;As these works have progressed, other works that could be undertaken to further improve the security, safety and functionality of the residence have been identified, and it is more efficient to complete these works while a major project is underway&quot;. In an interview with ABC News, Special Minister of State Gary Gray said the total cost would run into the millions of dollars. The original estimate of $3.19 million was rapidly exceeded and, , had been revised to $8.8 million.

In 2013, after Kevin Rudd replaced Julia Gillard as PM, he led Labor to the 2013 federal election which resulted in Coalition leader Tony Abbott becoming prime minister. Pending the completion of the renovations, Abbott chose to reside at Kirribilli House in Sydney and the Australian Federal Police College when he was in the capital. The renovations were not completed before Abbott&#x27;s term as prime minister ended, and thus he never had the opportunity to reside at The Lodge. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy moved into The Lodge in January 2016.

==Security==
The Lodge is highly secure. The residence has many security features in protecting the prime minister and their family, including the use of many security cameras, biometric security scanners, high fences, shatterproof windows, and a safe room.

<text>Deng Nan (; born October 1945 in Guang&#x27;an, Sichuan) is a Chinese politician and physicist.

==Early life==
Deng was born the second daughter of Deng Xiaoping with his third wife Zhuo Lin.

Deng studied physics at Peking University from 1964 to 1970. During university, she was secretary of the branch Communist Youth League of China. In Spring 1968, Nie Yuanzi directed Red Guards to detain Deng and her elder brother Deng Pufang. They were imprisoned in separate rooms of the physics department in an attempt to force self-criticisms from each. Deng was released relatively soon, whereas her brother was held and tortured for four months.

In 1970, Deng was sent to the Gaozhaizi Commune in present-day Ningqiang County for reeducation. She was assigned to the people&#x27;s welfare production brigade at Dingjiawan (), where she lived with the family of the branch secretary Jiang Yingchang. She participated in constructing terraces, drying cereals, collecting firewood, and other labour. In her first year, Deng was referred to as the most zealous of the intellectual youth sent to Ningqiang County.

==Career==
She served as vice minister of China&#x27;s State Science and Technology Commission (1998 - November 2004). She was a member of the 17th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

She is considered to be a princeling.

==Personal life==
Deng&#x27;s university classmate Zhang Hong () was sent to the same commune in Ningqiang County, where the two frequently cooked food and collected firewood together. They are thought to have already been romantically involved at this point. The two later had a daughter in 1972 called Deng Zhuorui (), alternatively known as Mianmian (), known professionally as Ran (Anne) Zhuo (). She married the CEO of Anbang Insurance Group, Wu Xiaohui in 2004. It was Wu&#x27;s third marriage and they had one son. In 2014, Zhuorui ceased being a shareholder in two companies owned by Anbang, which was followed by news of the couple&#x27;s separation in 2015.

<doc id="222779" wikidata="Q191964" url="?curid=222779" title="Diogenes of Apollonia">
<text>Diogenes of Apollonia ( ; ; 5th century BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, and was a native of the Milesian colony Apollonia in Thrace. He lived for some time in Athens. He believed air to be the one source of all being from which all other substances were derived, and, as a primal force, to be both divine and intelligent. He also wrote a description of the organization of blood vessels in the human body. His ideas were parodied by the dramatist Aristophanes, and may have influenced the Orphic philosophical commentary preserved in the Derveni papyrus. His philosophical work has not survived in a complete form, and his doctrines are known chiefly from lengthy quotations of his work by Simplicius, as well as a few summaries in the works of Aristotle, Theophrastus, and Aetius.

==Life==
Diogenes was a native of the Milesian colony Apollonia Pontica in Thrace, present-day Sozopol on the Black Sea. His father&#x27;s name was Apollothemis. Nothing is known of the events in his life, except that he lived some time in Athens. Diogenes Laërtius states that &quot;great jealousy nearly put his life in danger in Athens,&quot; but there may be confusion with Anaxagoras who is mentioned in the same passage. Like all the &quot;physiologoi&quot; (natural philosophers), he wrote in the Ionic dialect.

==Philosophy==
Diogenes is characterized by Theophrastus as the last of the &quot;physiologoi&quot; or natural philosophers. As a material monist, he synthesized the work of earlier monists such as Anaximenes and Heraclitus with the pluralism of Anaxagoras and Empedocles and argued that air was a divine cosmic ordering principle that he also equated with intelligence. He does not appear to have been influenced by the Atomists. 

===Air===
Diogenes, like Anaximenes, believed air to be the one source of all being, and all other substances to be derived from it by condensation and rarefaction. This he modified by the theories of his contemporary Anaxagoras, and asserted that air, the primal force, was intelligent:

And it seems to me that that which possessed thought is what people call air, and that by this everyone both is governed and has power over everything. For it is this which seems to me to be god and to have reached everything and to arrange everything and to be in everything. And there is not a single thing which does not share in it.

The nature of the universe is air, limitless and eternal, from which, as it condenses and rarefies and changes its properties, the other forms come into being. Among his other doctrines, he is said to have believed that there was an infinite number of worlds, and infinite void; that air, densified and rarefied, produced the different worlds; that nothing was produced from nothing, or was reduced to nothing; that the Earth was round, supported in the middle, and had received its shape from the whirling round of the warm vapours, and its concretion and hardening from cold.

===Physiology===
The longest surviving fragment of Diogenes is that which is inserted by Aristotle in the third book of his &quot;History of Animals&quot;. It contains a description of the distribution of the blood vessels in the human body. It is notable chiefly because &quot;here we can read at first hand what in the case of the other Presocratics we learn only indirectly: an attempt to describe in scientific detail the structure and organization of the physical world.&quot;

==Works==
None of Diogenes&#x27; work has survived in a complete form. The majority of the surviving fragments of Diogenes work come from Simplicius, a late antique philosopher from the Neoplatonic Academy who wrote a commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; where he quotes several long excerpts from Diogenes&#x27; work. Based on the account given by Simplicius, it is unclear to modern scholars whether Diogenes wrote four separate works, &quot;On Nature&quot;, &quot;On the Nature of Man&quot; &quot;Meteorology&quot;, and &quot;Against the Sophist&quot;, or only one work &quot;On Nature&quot; which included portions that touched on each of the other three topics.

==Legacy==
Modern scholars generally agree that some views of Diogenes are transferred to Aristophanes&#x27; depiction of Socrates in &quot;The Clouds.&quot; as well as in a fragment of Philemon.

Diogenite meteorites are named for Diogenes of Apollonia, who was the first to suggest an outer space origin for meteorites:
With the visible stars revolve stones which are invisible, and for that reason nameless. They often fall on the ground and are extinguished, like the stone star that came down on fire at Aegospotami.

===Modern Reception===
Based on an initial evaluation by Hermann Diels, Diogenes was not studied frequently in modern scholarships up until the past few decades. However, with the discovery of the Derveni papyrus, an Orphic philosophical poem which has many parallels to the philosophy of both Diogenes and Anaxagoras, many scholars have analyzed Diogenes&#x27; work to better understand the links between Ancient Greek religion and philosophy.

<text>A partnership is an agreement where parties agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. The partners in a partnership may be individuals, businesses, interest-based organizations, schools, governments or combinations. Organizations may partner to increase the likelihood of each achieving their mission and to amplify their reach. A partnership may result in issuing and holding equity or may be only governed by a contract.

==History==

Partnerships have a long history; they were already in use in medieval times in Europe and in the Middle East. According to a 2006 article, the first partnership was implemented in 1383 by Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant of Prato and Florence. The Covoni company (1336–40) and the Del Buono-Bencivenni company (1336–40) have also been referred to as early partnerships, but they were not formal partnerships.

In Europe, the partnerships contributed to the Commercial Revolution which started in the 13th century. In the 15th century the cities of the Hanseatic League would mutually strengthen each other; a ship from Hamburg to Gdansk would not only carry its own cargo but was also commissioned to transport freight for other members of the league. This practice not only saved time and money, but also constituted a first step toward partnership. This capacity to join forces in reciprocal services became a distinctive feature, and a long lasting success factor, of the Hanseatic team spirit.

A close examination of medieval trade in Europe shows that numerous significant credit based trades were not bearing interest. Hence, pragmatism and common sense called for a fair compensation for the risk of lending money, and a compensation for the opportunity cost of lending money without using it for other fruitful purposes. To circumvent the usury laws edicted by the Church, other forms of reward were created, in particular through the widespread form of partnership called &quot;commenda&quot;, very popular with Italian merchant bankers. Florentine merchant banks were almost sure to make a positive return on their loans, but this would be before taking into account solvency risks.

In the Middle East, the &quot;qirad&quot; and &quot;mudarabas&quot; institutions developed when trade with the Levant, namely the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim Near East, flourished and when early trading companies, contracts, bills of exchange and long-distance international trade were established. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Levant trade revived from the 10th to 11th century in Byzantine Italy. The eastern and western Mediterranean formed part of a single commercial civilization in the Middle Ages, and the two regions were economically interdependent through trade (in varying degrees).

The Mongols adopted and developed the concepts of liability in relation to investments and loans in Mongol–&quot;ortoq&quot; partnerships, promoting trade and investment to facilitate the commercial integration of the Mongol Empire. The contractual features of a Mongol-&quot;ortoq&quot; partnership closely resembled that of &quot;qirad&quot; and &quot;commenda&quot; arrangements; however, Mongol investors used metal coins, paper money, gold and silver ingots and tradable goods for partnership investments and primarily financed money-lending and trade activities. Moreover, Mongol elites formed trade partnerships with merchants from Central and Western Asia and Europe, including Marco Polo&#x27;s family.

==Partnership agreements==
To come into being, every partnership necessarily involves a partnership agreement, even if it has not been reduced to writing. In common law jurisdictions, a written partnership agreement is not legally required, but partners may benefit from a partnership agreement that articulates the important terms of their relationship.

In business, two or more companies join forces in a joint venture, a buyer–supplier relationship, a strategic alliance or a consortium to i) work on a project (e.g. industrial or research project) which would be too heavy or too risky for a single entity, ii) join forces to have a stronger position on the market, iii) comply with specific regulation (e.g. in some emerging countries, foreigners can only invest in the form of partnerships with local entrepreneurs).&lt;br&gt; In this case, the alliance may be structured in a process comparable to a Mergers &amp; Acquisitions transaction. A large literature in business and management has paid attention to forming and managing partnership agreements. It has, in particular, shown the role of contracts and relational mechanisms to organize business partnerships.

Partnerships present the involved parties with complex negotiations and special challenges that must be navigated to agreement. Overarching goals, levels of give-and-take, areas of responsibility, lines of authority and succession, how success is evaluated and distributed, and often a variety of other factors must all be negotiated. Once an agreement is reached, the partnership is typically enforceable by civil law, especially if well documented. Partners who wish to make their agreement affirmatively explicit and enforceable typically draw up articles of partnership. Trust and pragmatism are also essential as it cannot be expected that everything can be written in the initial partnership agreement, therefore quality governance and clear communication are critical success factors in the long run. It is common for information about formally partnered entities to be made public, such as through a press release, a newspaper ad, or public records laws.

==Partner compensation==
Partner compensation will often be defined by the terms of a partnership agreement. Partners who work for the partnership may receive compensation for their labor before any division of profits between partners.

===Equity vs. salaried partners===
In certain partnerships of individuals, particularly law firms and accountancy firms, equity partners are distinguished from salaried partners (or contract or income partners). The degree of control which each type of partner exerts over the partnership depends on the relevant partnership agreement.
*An equity partner is a part-owner of the business, and is entitled to a proportion of the distributable profits of the partnership.
* A salaried partner who is paid a salary but does not have any underlying ownership interest in the business and will not share in the distributions of the partnership (although it is quite common for salaried partners to receive a bonus based on the firm&#x27;s profitability).

Although individuals in both categories are described as partners, equity partners and salaried partners have little in common other than joint and several liability. In many legal systems, salaried partners are not technically &quot;partners&quot; at all in the eyes of the law. However, if their firm holds them out as partners, they are nonetheless subject to joint and several liabilities.

In their most basic form, equity partners enjoy a fixed share of the partnership (usually, but not always an equal share with the other partners) and, upon distribution of profits, receive a portion of the partnership&#x27;s profits proportionate to that share. In more sophisticated partnerships, different models exist for determining either ownership interest, profit distribution, or both. Two common alternate approaches to distribution of profit are &quot;lockstep&quot; and &quot;source of origination&quot; compensation (sometimes referred to, more graphically, as &quot;eat what you kill&quot;).
*Lockstep involves new partners joining the partnership with a certain number of &quot;points&quot;. As time passes, they accrue additional points, until they reach a set maximum sometimes referred to as a plateau. The length of time it takes to reach the maximum is often used to describe the firm (so, for example, one could say that one firm has a &quot;seven-year lockstep&quot; and another has a &quot;ten-year lockstep&quot; depending on the length of time it takes to reach maximum equity).
*Source of origination involves the compensation of profits according to a formula that takes into consideration the amount of revenue and profit generated by each partner, such that partners who generate more revenue receive a greater share of the partnership&#x27;s distributed profit.

===Law firms===
The source of origination compensation is rarely seen outside of law firms. The principle is simply that each partner receives a share of the partnership profits up to a certain amount, with any additional profits being distributed to the partner who was responsible for the &quot;origination&quot; of the work that generated the profits.

British law firms tend to use the lockstep principle, whereas American firms are more accustomed to source of origination. When British firm Clifford Chance merged with American firm Rogers &amp; Wells, many of the difficulties associated with that merger were blamed on the difficulties of merging a lockstep culture with a source of origination culture.

==Taxation==
Partnerships recognized by a government body may enjoy special benefits from taxation policy. Among developed countries, for example, business partnerships are often favored over corporations in taxation policy, since dividend taxes only occur on profit before they are distributed to the partners. However, depending on the partnership structure and the jurisdiction in which it operates, owners of a partnership may be exposed to greater personal liability than they would as shareholders of a corporation. In such countries, partnerships are often regulated via antitrust laws, so as to inhibit monopolistic practices and foster free market competition. Enforcement of the laws, however, varies considerably. Domestic partnerships recognized by governments typically enjoy tax benefits, as well.

==Common law==
At common law, members of a business partnership are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. Forms of partnership have evolved that may limit a partner&#x27;s liability.

===Forms of partnership===
The general partnership, in which all partners manage the business and are personally liable for its debts, developed under common law. General partners have an obligation of strict liability to third parties injured by the Partnership. General partners may have joint liability or joint and several liability depending upon circumstances.

The limited partnership (LP) is a partnership in which general partners manage the partnership&#x27;s operations, and limited partners forego the right to manage the business in exchange for limited liability for the partnership debts. The liability of limited partners is limited to their investment in the partnership. This form of partnership was developed in the 19th century, the U.K. where it was imparted by charter, and in the U.S. where it was created by statute.

More recently, additional forms of partnership have been recognized:
*limited liability partnership (LLP): a form of partnership in which all partners may have some degree of limited liability.
* limited liability limited partnership (LLLP): a form of limited partnership in which general partners have limited liability for the debts and obligations of the limited partnership.

===Silent partners===
A silent partner or sleeping partner is one who still shares in the profits and losses of the business, but who is not involved in its management. Sometimes the silent partner&#x27;s interest in the business will not be publicly known. A silent partner is often an investor in the partnership, who is entitled to a share of the partnership&#x27;s profits. Silent partners may prefer to invest in limited partnerships in order to insulate their personal assets from the debts or liabilities of the partnership.

===Oceania===
====Australia====

Summarising s. 5 of the &quot;Partnership Act 1958&quot; (Vic), for a partnership in Australia to exist, four main criteria must be satisfied. They are:
* Valid Agreement between the parties;
* To carry on a business – this is defined in s. 3 as &quot;any trade, occupation or profession&quot;;
* In Common – meaning there must be some mutuality of rights, interests and obligations;
* View to Profit – thus charitable organizations cannot be partnerships (charities are typically incorporated associations under &quot;Associations Incorporations Act 1981&quot; (Vic))
Partners share profits and losses. A partnership is basically a settlement between two or more groups or firms in which profit and loss are equally divided

===South Asia===
====Bangladesh====
In Bangladesh, the relevant law for regulating partnership is the Partnership Act 1932. A partnership is defined as the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. The law does not require written partnership agreement between the partners to form a partnership. A partnership is not required to be registered, but a partnership is considered as a separate legal identity from its owners only if the partnership is registered. There must be a minimum of 2 partners and maximum of 20 partners.

====India====
According to section 4 of the Partnership Act of 1932,&quot;Partnership is defined as the relation between two or more persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any one of them acting for all&quot;. This definition superseded the previous definition given in section 239 of Indian Contract Act 1872 as – &quot;Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons who have agreed to combine their property, labor, skill in some business, and to share the profits thereof between them&quot;. The 1932 definition added the concept of mutual agency. The Indian Partnerships have the following common characteristics:

1) A partnership firm is not a legal entity apart from the partners constituting it. It has limited identity for the purpose of tax law as per section 4 of the Partnership Act of 1932.

2) Partnership is a concurrent subject. Contracts of partnerships are included in the Entry no.7 of List III of The Constitution of India (the list constitutes the subjects on which both the State government and Central (National) Government can legislate i.e. pass laws on).

3) Unlimited Liability. The major disadvantage of partnership is the unlimited liability of partners for the debts and liabilities of the firm. Any partner can bind the firm and the firm is liable for all liabilities incurred by any firm on behalf of the firm. If property of partnership firm is insufficient to meet liabilities, personal property of any partner can be attached to pay the debts of the firm.

4) Partners are Mutual Agents.The business of firm can be carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Any partner has authority to bind the firm. Act of any one partner is binding on all the partners. Thus, each partner is &#x27;agent&#x27; of all the remaining partners. Hence, partners are &#x27;mutual agents&#x27;. Section 18 of the Partnership Act, 1932 says &quot;Subject to the provisions of this Act, a partner is the agent of the firm for the purpose of the business of the firm&quot;

5) Oral or Written Agreements. The Partnership Act, 1932 nowhere mentions that the Partnership Agreement is to be in written or oral format. Thus the general rule of the Contract Act applies that the contract can be &#x27;oral&#x27; or &#x27;written&#x27; as long as it satisfies the basic conditions of being a contract i.e. the agreement between partners is legally enforceable. A written agreement is advisable to establish existence of partnership and to prove rights and liabilities of each partner, as it is difficult to prove an oral agreement.

6) Number of Partners is minimum 2 and maximum 50 in any kind of business activities. Since partnership is &#x27;agreement&#x27; there must be minimum two partners. The Partnership Act does not put any restrictions on maximum number of partners. However, section 464 of Companies Act 2013, and Rule 10 of Companies (Miscellaneous) Rules, 2014 prohibits partnership consisting of more than 50 for any businesses, unless it is registered as a company under Companies Act, 2013 or formed in pursuance of some other law. Some other law means companies and corporations formed via some other law passed by Parliament of India.

7) Mutual agency is the real test. The real test of &#x27;partnership firm&#x27; is &#x27;mutual agency&#x27; set by the Courts of India, i.e. whether a partner can bind the firm by his act, i.e. whether he can act as agent of all other partners.

===North America===
====Canada====
Statutory regulation of partnerships in Canada fall under provincial jurisdiction. A partnership is not a separate legal entity and partnership income is taxed at the rate of the partner receiving the income. It can be deemed to exist regardless of the intention of the partners. Common elements considered by courts in determining the existence of a partnership are that two or more legal persons:
*Are carrying on a business
*In common
*With a view to profit.

====United States====

Under U.S. law a partnership is a business association of two or more individuals, through which partners share the profits and responsibility for the liabilities of their venture. U.S. states recognize forms of limited partnership that may allow a partner who does not participate in the business venture to avoid liability for the partnership&#x27;s debts and obligations. Partnerships typically pay less taxes than corporations in fields like fund management.

The federal government of the United States does not have specific statutory law governing the establishment of partnerships. Instead, every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has its own statutes and common law that govern partnerships. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has issued non-binding model laws (called uniform act) in which to encourage the adoption of uniformity of partnership law into the states by their respective legislatures. Model laws include the Uniform Partnership Act and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act. Most U.S. states have adopted a form of the Uniform Partnership Act, which includes provisions regulating general partnerships, limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships.

Although the federal government does not have specific statutory law for establishing partnerships, it has an extensive statutory and regulatory scheme for the taxation of partnerships, set forth in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and Code of Federal Regulations. The IRC defines federal tax obligations for partnership operations that effectively serve as federal regulation of some aspects of partnerships.

===East Asia===
====China====
====Hong Kong====

A partnership in Hong Kong is a business entity formed by the Hong Kong Partnerships Ordinance, which defines a partnership as &quot;the relation between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit&quot; and is not a joint stock company or an incorporated company. If the business entity registers with the Registrar of Companies it takes the form of a limited partnership defined in the Limited Partnerships Ordinance. However, if this business entity fails to register with the Registrar of Companies, then it becomes a general partnership as a default.

===Europe===
====United Kingdom limited partnership====
A limited partnership in the United Kingdom consists of:

* One or more people called general partners, who are liable for all debts and obligations of the firm; and
* One or of the firm beyond the amount contributed.

Limited partners may not:

* Draw out or receive back any part of their contributions to the partnership during its lifetime; or
* Take part in the management of the business or have power to bind the firm.

If they do, they become liable for all the debts and obligations of the firm up to the amount drawn out or received back or incurred while taking part in the management, as the case may be.

<doc id="222788" wikidata="Q183403" url="?curid=222788" title="Ishmael">
<text>In the biblical Book of Genesis, Ishmael (; ; ; ) was the first son of Abraham. His mother was Hagar, the handmaiden of Abraham&#x27;s wife Sarah. He died at the age of 137. Traditionally, he is seen as the ancestor of the Arabs.

Within Islam, Ishmael is regarded as a prophet and the ancestor of the Ishmaelites (Hagarenes or Adnanites) and patriarch of Qaydār.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Yishma&#x27;el&quot; existed in various ancient Semitic cultures, including early Babylonian and Minæan. In the Amorite language, it is attested as &quot;yaśmaʿ-ʾel&quot;. It is a theophoric name translated literally as &quot;God (El) has hearkened&quot;, suggesting that &quot;a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise&quot;.

==Genesis narrative==
The Genesis narrative sees the account of Ishmael&#x27;s life through the .

===Birth===
The birth of Ishmael was planned by the Patriarch Abraham&#x27;s first wife, who at that time was known as Sarai. She and her husband Abram (Abraham) sought a way to have children in order to fulfill the Abrahamic covenant that was established in . Sarai was 75 years old and had yet to bear a child. She had the idea to offer her Egyptian handmaiden Hagar to her husband so that they could have a child by her. Abraham slept with Hagar and she begat a child.

Hagar and Sarah began to show contempt for each other, they responded by treating each other harshly. Abraham then told Hagar to flee her home and go into the desert region between Abraham&#x27;s settlement and Shur. describes the naming of Ishmael and God&#x27;s promise to Hagar concerning Ishmael and his descendants. This occurred at the well of Beer-lahai-roi, where Hagar encountered the Angel of the Lord, who said to her &quot;Behold, you are with child / And shall bear a son; / You shall call him Ishmael, / For the Lord has paid heed to your suffering.&quot; The Angel commanded Hagar, &quot;Return to your mistress [Sarai] and submit to her.&quot;

Abraham was blessed so that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars in the sky. God would make of Ishmael a great nation because he was of the seed of Abraham. However, God told Hagar that her son would be living in conflict with his relatives. When Ishmael was born, Abraham was 86 years old.

===Inheritance, rights and the first circumcision===

When he was 13 years old, Ishmael was circumcised at the same time as all other males in Abraham&#x27;s household, becoming a part of the covenant in a mass circumcision. His father Abram, given the new name &quot;Abraham&quot;, then 99, was circumcised along with the others.

At the time of the covenant, God informed Abraham that his wife Sarah would give birth to a son, whom he was instructed to name Isaac. God told Abraham that He would establish his covenant through Isaac, and when Abraham inquired as to Ishmael&#x27;s role, God answered that Ishmael has been blessed and that he &quot;will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget and I will make him a great nation.&quot; God also mentioned that &quot;He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be over (against) everyone, And everyone&#x27;s hand will be against him; And he will live in the presence of his brethren.&quot;

A year later, Ishmael&#x27;s half-brother Isaac was born to Abraham by his first wife Sarah when she was 90 years old, after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility.

On the day of feasting during which Abraham celebrated the weaning of Isaac, Ishmael was &quot;mocking&quot; or &quot;playing with&quot; Isaac (the Hebrew word , is ambiguous) and Sarah asked Abraham to expel Ishmael and his mother, saying: &quot;Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman&#x27;s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.&quot; Her demand was painful for Abraham, who loved Ishmael. Abraham agreed only after God told him that &quot;in Isaac your seed shall be called&quot; and that God would &quot;make a nation of the son of the bondwoman&quot; Ishmael, since he was a descendant of Abraham (), God having previously told Abraham &quot;I will establish My covenant with [Isaac]&quot;, while also making promises concerning the Ishmaelite nation ().

At the age of 14, Ishmael was freed along with his mother. The Lord&#x27;s covenant made clear Ishmael was not to inherit Abraham&#x27;s house and that Isaac would be the seed of the covenant: &quot;Take your son, your only son, whom you love and go to the region of Moriah.&quot; (Genesis )
Abraham gave Ishmael and his mother a supply of bread and water and sent them away. Hagar entered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba where the two soon ran out of water and Hagar, not wanting to witness the death of her son, set the boy some distance away from herself, and wept. &quot;And God heard the voice of the lad&quot; and sent his angel to tell Hagar, &quot;Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.&quot; And God &quot;opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water&quot;, from which she drew to save Ishmael&#x27;s life and her own. &quot;And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.&quot; ()

===Descendants===
After roaming the wilderness for some time, Ishmael and his mother settled in the Desert of Paran, where he became an expert in archery. Eventually, his mother found him a wife from the land of Egypt. They had twelve sons each of whom became a tribal chief in one of the regions from Havilah to Shur (from Assyria to the border of Egypt). His sons:

#Nebaioth ( &quot;Nəḇāyōṯ&quot;)
#Kedar ( &quot;Qēḏār&quot;), father of the Qedarites, a northern Arab tribe that controlled the area between the Persian Gulf and the Sinai Peninsula. According to tradition, he is the ancestor of the Quraysh tribe, and thus, ancestor of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
#Adbeel ( &quot;ʾAḏbəʾēl&quot;)
#Mibsam ( &quot;Mīḇsām&quot;)
#Mishma ( &quot;Mīšmāʿ&quot;)
#Dumah ( &quot;Ḏūmā&quot;)
#Massa ( &quot;Massāʾ&quot;)
#Hadad ( &quot;Ḥăḏaḏ&quot;)
#Tema ( &quot;Ṯēmāʾ&quot;)
#Jetur ( &quot;Yəṭūr&quot;)
#Naphish ( &quot;Nāfīš&quot;)
#Kedemah ( &quot;Qēḏəmā&quot;)

Ishmael also had one known daughter, Mahalath or Basemath, the third wife of Esau.

Abraham&#x27;s corpse was not buried until Ishmael was sent news and after his arrival at the burial. Ishmael died at the age of 137.

==Family tree==














== In various traditions ==

Historians and academics in the field of source criticism believe that the stories of Ishmael belong to the three strata of J, or Yahwist source, the P, or Priestly source, and the E, or Elohist source (See Documentary hypothesis). For example, the narration in is of J type and the narration in is of E type. Genesis 25 would have been added during the Persian Period by the Priestly source, who attributed the known Ishmaelite (Shumu&#x27;ilu) Tribes as the names of the sons of Ishmael, although the narrative and name of Ishmael himself preceded this.

Jewish and Islamic traditions consider Ishmael to be the ancestor of Arabs.

===Judaism===

In later Jewish texts, Ishmael is portrayed as someone who was inclined towards many things Abraham considered wicked. Rabbinic sources say that Ishmael prayed to idols when he believed to be alone, although there is no indication of this behavior from the biblical narrative. According to the Book of Genesis, in the Hebrew Bible, Isaac rather than Ishmael was the true heir of the Abrahamic tradition and covenant, while at the same time being blessed by God with a great nation.

In some traditions Ishmael is said to have had two wives, one of them named Aisha. This name corresponds to the Muslim tradition for the name of Muhammad&#x27;s wife. This is understood as a metaphoric representation of the Muslim world (first Arabs and then Turks) with Ishmael.

Rabbinical commentators in the Midrash Genesis Rabbah also say that Ishmael&#x27;s mother Hagar was the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, making Ishmael the Pharaoh&#x27;s grandson. This could be why Genesis 17:20 refers to Ishmael as the father of 12 mighty princes. According to Genesis 21:21, Hagar married Ishmael to an Egyptian woman, and if Rabbinical commentators are correct that Hagar was the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, his marriage to a woman she selected could explain how and why his sons became princes.

According to other Jewish commentators, Ishmael&#x27;s mother Hagar is identified with Keturah, the woman Abraham sought out and married after Sarah&#x27;s death. It is suggested that Keturah was Hagar&#x27;s personal name, and that &quot;Hagar&quot; was a descriptive label meaning &quot;stranger&quot;. This interpretation is discussed in the Midrash and is supported by Rashi, Gur Aryeh, Keli Yakar, and Obadiah of Bertinoro. Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Itzhaki) argues that &quot;Keturah&quot; was a name given to Hagar because her deeds were as beautiful as incense (Hebrew, &quot;ketoret&quot;), and that she remained chaste (literally &quot;tied her opening&quot;, with the verb &quot;tied&quot; in Aramaic being &quot;k-t-r&quot;) from the time she was separated from Abraham.

It is also said that Sarah was motivated by Ishmael&#x27;s sexually frivolous ways because of the reference to his &quot;making merry&quot; (Gen. 21:9), a translation of the Hebrew word &quot;Mitzachek&quot;. This was developed into a reference to idolatry, sexual immorality or even murder; some rabbinic sources claim that Sarah worried that Ishmael would negatively influence Isaac, or that he would demand Isaac&#x27;s inheritance on the grounds of being the firstborn. Regarding the word &quot;Mitzachek&quot; (again in Gen. 21:9) The Jewish Study Bible by Oxford University Press says this word in this particular context is associated with &quot;Playing is another pun on Isaac&#x27;s name (cf. 17.17; 18.12; 19.14; 26.8). Ishmael was &#x27;Isaacing&#x27;, or &#x27;taking Isaac&#x27;s place&#x27;.&quot; Others take a more positive view, emphasizing Hagar&#x27;s piety, noting that she was &quot;the one who had sat by the well and besought him who is the life of the worlds, saying &#x27;look upon my misery&#x27;&quot;.

In Rabbinic literature, the name of Ishmael is an allusion to God&#x27;s promise to hear the complaints of Israel whenever it suffered at the hands of Ishmael (Gen. R. xlv. 11). Abraham endeavored to bring up Ishmael in righteousness; to train him in the laws of hospitality Abraham gave him the calf to prepare (Gen. R. xlviii. 14; comp. Gen. xviii. 7). But according to divine prediction Ishmael remained a savage. The ambiguous expression in Gen. xxi. 9 (see Hagar) is interpreted by some rabbis as meaning that Ishmael had been idolatrous; by others, that he had turned his bow against Isaac. According to the interpretation of Simeon b. Yoḥai, Ishmael mocked those who maintained that Isaac would be Abraham&#x27;s chief heir, and said that as he (Ishmael) was the first-born son he would receive two-thirds of the inheritance (Tosef., Sotah, v. 12, vi. 6; Pirḳe R. El. xxx.; Gen. R. liii. 15). Upon seeing the danger to Isaac, Sarah, who had till then been attached to Ishmael (Josephus, &quot;Ant.&quot; i. 12, § 3), insisted that Abraham cast out Ishmael. Abraham was obliged to put him on Hagar&#x27;s shoulders, because he fell sick under the spell of the evil eye cast upon him by Sarah (Gen. R. liii. 17).

Ishmael, left under a shrub by his despairing mother, prayed to God to take his soul and not permit him to suffer the torments of a slow death (comp. Targ. pseudo-Jonathan to Gen. xxi. 15). God then commanded the angel to show Hagar the well which was created on Friday in the week of Creation, in the twilight (comp. Ab. v. 6), and which afterward accompanied the Israelites in the wilderness (Pirḳe R. El. xxx.). But this was protested against by the angels, who said: &quot;Why should Ishmael have water, since his descendants will destroy the Israelites by thirst?&quot; (comp. Yer. Ta&#x27;an. iv. 8; Lam. R. ii. 2). God replied: &quot;But now he is innocent, and I judge him according to what he is now&quot; (Pirḳe R. El. l.c.; Gen. R. l.c.; et al.). Ishmael married a Moabitess named &#x27;Adishah or &#x27;Aishah (variants &quot;&#x27;Ashiyah&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Aifah,&quot; Arabic names; Targ. pseudo-Jonathan to Gen. xxi. 21; Pirḳe R. El. l.c.); or, according to &quot;Sefer ha-Yashar&quot; (Wayera), an Egyptian named Meribah or Merisah. He had four sons and one daughter. Ishmael meanwhile grew so skilful in archery that he became the master of all the bowmen (Targ. pseudo-Jonathan to Gen. xxi. 20; Gen.R. liii. 20). Afterward Abraham went to see Ishmael, and, according to his promise to Sarah, stopped at his son&#x27;s tent without alighting from his camel. Ishmael was not within; his wife refused Abraham food, and beat her children and cursed her husband within Abraham&#x27;s hearing. Abraham thereupon asked her to tell Ishmael when he returned that an old man had asked that he change the peg of the tent. Ishmael understood that it was his father, took the hint, and drove away his wife. He then married another woman, named Faṭimah (Peḳimah; Targ. pseudo-Jonathan l.c.), who, when three years later Abraham came again to see his son, received him kindly; therefore Abraham asked her to tell Ishmael that the peg was good.

Ishmael then went to Canaan and settled with his father (Pirḳe R. El. l.c.; &quot;Sefer ha-Yashar,&quot; l.c.). This statement agrees with that of Baba Batra (16a)—that Ishmael became a penitent during the lifetime of Abraham. He who sees Ishmael in a dream will have his prayer answered by God (Ber. 56a).

===Samaritanism===
In Samaritan Torah version, Ishmael was described in Book of Genesis 16 as a &#x27;fertile of man&#x27; instead of a &#x27;wild ass of a man&#x27; as suggested in Masoretic Pentateuch which commonly used as standard version of Hebrew Bible in Jewish community.

===Christianity===

In the Epistle to the Galatians (4:21–31), Paul uses the incident to symbolize the two covenants the old but fulfilled and new covenant which is universal by promise through Jesus Christ. In Galatians 4:28–31, Hagar is associated with the Sinai covenant, while Sarah is associated with the covenant of grace into which her son Isaac enters.

===Pre-Islamic Arabia===
Some Pre-Islamic poetry mentions Ishmael, his father Abraham, and a sacrifice story, such as the Pre-Islamic poet &quot;Umayyah Ibn Abi As-Salt&quot;, who said in one of his poems: ([The sacrifice] of his first-born of whose separation he [Abraham] could not bear neither could he see him surrounded in foes).

Also, some of the tribes of Central West Arabia called themselves the &quot;people of Abraham and the offspring of Ishmael&quot;, as evidenced by a common opening of speeches and harangues of reconciliation between rival tribes in that area.

===Islam===

Ishmael (Arabic: إسماعيل &quot;Ismāʿīl&quot;) is recognized as an important prophet of Islam. Like Christians and Jews, Muslims believe that Ishmael was the firstborn of Abraham, born to him from his wife&#x27;s maidservant Hagar. Ishmael is recognized by Muslims as the ancestor of several northern prominent Arab tribes and the forefather of Adnan, the ancestor of Muhammad. Muslims also believe that Muhammad was the descendant of Ishmael who would establish a great nation.

==== In the Quran ====
Ishmael is mentioned over ten times in the Quran, often alongside other prophets of ancient times. He is mentioned together with Elisha and Dhul-Kifl as one of &quot;the patiently enduring and righteous, whom God caused to enter into his mercy.&quot; It is also said of Lut, Elisha, Jonah and Ishmael, that God gave each one &quot; favouring each over other people ˹of their time˺&quot;. These references to Ishmael are, in each case, part of a larger context in which other holy prophets are mentioned. In other chapters of the Quran, however, which date from the Medina period, Ishmael is mentioned closely with his father Abraham: Ishmael stands alongside Abraham in their attempt to raised the foundation of the Kaaba in Mecca as a place of monotheistic pilgrimage and Abraham thanks God for granting him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age. Ishmael is further mentioned alongside other prophets who had been given revelations and Jacob&#x27;s sons promised to follow the faith of their forefathers, &quot;Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac&quot;, when testifying their faith. In the Quranic narrative of the near-sacrifice of Abraham&#x27;s son, the son is not named and, although the general interpretation is that it was Ishmael, Tabari maintained that it was Isaac, consistent with the Hebrew scriptures. Most modern commentators, however, regard the son&#x27;s identification as least important in a narrative given for its moral lesson.

====Ishmael in Muslim literature====
The commentaries on the Quran and the numerous collections of &quot;Stories of the Prophets&quot; flesh out the Islamic perspective of Ishmael and detail what they describe as his integral part in setting up the Kaaba. According to Muslim tradition, Ishmael was buried at the Hijr near the Kaaba, inside the Sacred Mosque.

In Islamic belief, Abraham prayed to God for a son and God heard his prayer. Muslim exegesis states that Sarah asked Abraham to marry her Egyptian handmaiden Hagar because she herself was barren. Hagar soon bore Ishmael, who was the first son of Abraham. God then instructed Abraham to take Hagar and Ishmael to the desert and leave them there. He did so, taking them to the location of the Kaaba&#x27;s foundations (which now was in ruins) and as he turned away from Hagar and started to walk away she called out to him and asked &quot;Why are you leaving us here?&quot;, to which Abraham didn&#x27;t reply the first two times she asked. She then changed her question and asked &quot;Did God command you to do this?&quot; to which Abraham stopped, turned around, looked back and replied &quot;Yes.&quot; She responded, &quot;Then God will provide for us.&quot; Abraham then continued on his journey back to Sarah. In the desert, the baby Ishmael cried with thirst. His mother placed him in the shade under a bush and went on a frantic search for water, which resulted in her running seven times between the Safa and Marwah hills trying to find a source of water or a passing caravan she could trade with for water. Hagar, not finding any sources of water and fearing the death of her baby, sat down and cried asking for God&#x27;s help. God sent angel Gabriel to her informing her to lift up her baby and when she did, she noticed that his feet had scratched the ground allowing a spring of water to bubble up to the surface. Hagar quickly shifted the ground to form a well around the spring to contain the water, forming the Zamzam well. Hagar refilled the bottle with water and gave her baby a drink. This spring became known to caravans that traveled through Arabia and Hagar negotiated deals with them for supplies in exchange for the water. From her actions, the city of Mecca (originally Becca or Baca in Hebrew) grew, and attracted settlers who stayed and provided protection for her and Ishmael as well as being sources of various goods brought in and exchanged with visiting caravans. To commemorate the blessing of the Zamzam well God gave to Hagar and Ishmael, Muslims run between the Safa and Marwah hills retracing Hagar&#x27;s steps during the rites of Hajj.

Abraham returned and visited Ishmael at various times throughout his life. At one time, according to a tradition of Muhammad, Abraham had arrived when his son was out and Abraham visited with Ishmael&#x27;s wife. Abraham decided to leave before seeing his son, but based upon the complaints Ishmael&#x27;s wife made in response to his questions, he gave her a message to give to her husband when he returned home, which was &quot;change his threshold.&quot; When Ishmael arrived that night, he asked if they had had any visitors, and was informed by his wife of the man who had visited and what he said. Ishmael understood his father and explained to his wife that the visitor was his father and he had been instructed to divorce his wife and find a better one, which Ishmael did. Some time after this, Abraham returned to visit Ishmael and again Ishmael was out. Abraham talked with Ishmael&#x27;s new wife and found her answers indicated faith in God and contentment with her husband. Abraham again had to leave before he saw his son, but left him the message to &quot;keep his threshold.&quot; When Ishmael returned that night, he again asked if there had been any visitors and was informed of Abraham&#x27;s visit. Ishmael told his wife who it was that had come to visit and that he approved of her and their marriage.

On one of his visits to Mecca, Abraham is said to have asked his son to help him raised the foundation of the Kaaba. Islamic traditions hold that the Kaaba was first built by Adam and that Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the Kaaba on the old foundations. As Ishmael grew up in Arabia, he is said to have become fluent in Arabic. In the genealogical trees that the early scholars drew, Ishmael was considered the ancestor of the Northern Arabs and Muhammad was linked to him through the lineage of Adnan.

===Bahá&#x27;í Faith===
The scriptures of the Baháʼí Faith state that it was Ishmael, and not Isaac, who was the son Abraham almost sacrificed. But they also state that the name is unimportant as either could be used: the importance is that both were symbols of sacrifice. According to Shoghi Effendi, there has also been another Ishmael, a prophet of Israel, commonly known as Samuel.

<text>Lata Mangeshkar (; born Hema Mangeshkar; 28 September 1929 – 6 February 2022) was an Indian playback singer and occasional music composer. She is considered to be one of the greatest and most influential singers of the Indian subcontinent. Her contribution to the Indian music industry in a career spanning eight decades gained her honorific titles such as the &quot;Queen of Melody&quot;, &quot;Nightingale of India&quot;, and &quot;Voice of the Millennium&quot;.

Mangeshkar recorded songs in over thirty-six Indian languages and a few foreign languages, though primarily in Hindi, Bengali and Marathi. She received several accolades and honors throughout her career. In 1989, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed on her by the Government of India. In 2001, in recognition of her contributions to the nation, she was awarded the Bharat Ratna, becoming only the second singer to receive India&#x27;s highest civilian honour. In 2007, France made her an Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, the country&#x27;s highest civilian award.

She was the recipient of three National Film Awards, 15 Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association Awards, four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards, before declining further ones, two Filmfare Special Awards, the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award amongst others. In 1974, she became the first Indian playback singer to perform at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England.

She appeared in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the most recorded artist in history before being replaced by her sister, Asha Bhosle.

== Early life ==
Mangeshkar was born on 28 September 1929in Indore (in the present-day Indore district of Madhya Pradesh), then the capital of the princely state of Indore which was part of the Central India Agency in British India.

Her father, Deenanath Mangeshkar was a Marathi and Konkani classical singer and theatre actor. Deenanath&#x27;s father was Ganesh Bhatt Bhikoba (Bhikambhatt) Navathe Hardikar (Abhisheki), a Karhade Brahmin who served as a priest at the famous Mangeshi Temple in Goa. Deenanath&#x27;s mother Yesubai was his father&#x27;s mistress belonging to the Devadasi community of Goa, a matrilineal community of temple artists now known as Gomantak Maratha Samaj. As a Devadasi, Yesubai was a reputed musician. Deenanath&#x27;s father&#x27;s surname was &quot;Hardikar&quot;. Deenanath had taken the surname Mangeshkar, based on the name of his ancestral village, Mangeshi in Goa.

Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), was a Gujarati woman from Thalner, Bombay Presidency (now in northwest Maharashtra). Shevanti was Deenanath&#x27;s second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died before his marriage to Shevanti, was Shevanti&#x27;s older sister. Her maternal grandfather, Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, was from Gujarat, a prosperous businessman and landlord of Thalner. She learned Gujarati folk songs such as garbas of Pavagadh from her maternal grandmother.

Lata was named &quot;Hema&quot; at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father&#x27;s plays.

She was the eldest child in the family. Meena, Asha, Usha and Hridaynath, in birth order, are her siblings; all are accomplished singers and musicians.

She received her first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father&#x27;s musical plays (&quot;Sangeet Natak&quot; in Marathi). On her first day of school, Mangeshkar left because she was not allowed to bring her sister Asha along with her.

== Singing career ==
=== Early career in the 1940s ===

In 1942, when Mangeshkar was 13, her father died of heart disease. Master Vinayak (Vinayak Damodar Karnataki), the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend of the Mangeshkar family, took care of them. He helped her get started in a career as a singer and actress.

She sang the song &quot;Naachu Yaa Gade, Khelu Saari Mani Haus Bhaari&quot;, which was composed by Sadashivrao Nevrekar for Vasant Joglekar&#x27;s Marathi movie &quot;Kiti Hasaal&quot; (1942), but the song was dropped from the final cut. Vinayak gave her a small role in Navyug Chitrapat&#x27;s Marathi movie &quot;Pahili Mangalaa-gaur&quot; (1942), in which she sang &quot;Natali Chaitraachi Navalaai&quot; which was composed by Dada Chandekar. Her first Hindi song was &quot;Mata Ek Sapoot Ki Duniya Badal De Tu&quot; for the Marathi film &quot;Gajaabhaau&quot; (1943). The Bollywood industry was yet to find its feet, so Mangeshkar had to first concentrate on acting, which she did not like, as the lights and people ordering her around made her feel uncomfortable.

She moved to Mumbai in 1945 when Master Vinayak&#x27;s company moved its headquarters there. She started taking lessons in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan of Bhindibazaar Gharana. She sang &quot;Paa Lagoon Kar Jori&quot; for Vasant Joglekar&#x27;s Hindi-language movie &quot;Aap Ki Seva Mein&quot; (1946), which was composed by Datta Davjekar. The dance in the film was performed by Rohini Bhate, who later became a famous classical dancer. Lata and her sister Asha played minor roles in Vinayak&#x27;s first Hindi-language movie, &quot;Badi Maa&quot; (1945). In that movie, Lata also sang a bhajan, &quot;Maata Tere Charnon Mein.&quot; She was introduced to music director Vasant Desai during the recording of Vinayak&#x27;s second Hindi-language movie, &quot;Subhadra&quot; (1946).

After Vinayak&#x27;s death in 1948, music director Ghulam Haider mentored her as a singer. He introduced her to producer Sashadhar Mukherjee, who was then working on the movie &quot;Shaheed&quot; (1948), but Mukherjee dismissed her voice as &quot;too thin&quot;. An annoyed Haider responded that in coming years producers and directors would &quot;fall at Lata&#x27;s feet&quot; and &quot;beg her&quot; to sing in their movies. Haider gave her her first major break with the song &quot;Dil Mera Toda, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chhora&quot;—lyrics by Nazim Panipati—in the movie &quot;Majboor&quot; (1948), which became her first big breakthrough film hit. In an interview on her 84th birthday in 2013, she declared &quot;Ghulam Haider is truly my Godfather. He was the first music director who showed complete faith in my talent.&quot;

Initially, she is said to have imitated the acclaimed singer Noor Jehan, but she later developed her own style of singing. She brought a new signature style of singing to Indian film music, moving away from mehfil-style performances to suit both &#x27;modern&#x27; and &#x27;traditional&#x27; female protagonists. A soprano range voice with less volume or amplitude, she had enough weight in her voice to give definite shape to the melody of Indian film songs. Although she had limited coloratura skills in her early career, she developed better tone and pitch as she progressed in her playback career. Lyrics of songs in Hindi movies were, in those days, primarily composed by Urdu poets and contained a higher proportion of Urdu words, including the dialogue. Actor Dilip Kumar once made a mildly disapproving remark about her accent while singing Hindi/Urdu songs; so for a period of time, she took lessons in Urdu from an Urdu teacher named Shafi. In subsequent interviews she said that Noor Jehan heard her as a child and had told her to practice a lot. The two stayed in touch with each other for many years to come.

One of her first major hits was &quot;Aayega Aanewaala,&quot; a song in the movie &quot;Mahal&quot; (1949), composed by music director Khemchand Prakash and lip-synced on screen by actress Madhubala. This was a defining moment for her, and a catalyst for the recognition of playback singers in India. Before this, playback singers were seen as the vocal equivalent of a stuntman and remained invisible and uncredited. This song was such a big hit, that Radio Goa revealed her identity and she became a star in her own right. This opened the door for other playback singers to achieve the recognition they deserved.

=== 1950s ===
In the 1950s, Mangeshkar sang songs composed by various music directors of the period, including Anil Biswas (in films such as &quot;Tarana&quot; (1951) and &quot;Heer&quot; (1956)), Shankar Jaikishan, Naushad Ali, S. D. Burman, Sardul Singh Kwatra, Amarnath, Husanlal, and Bhagatram (in films like &quot;Bari Behen&quot; (1949), &quot;Meena Bazaar&quot; (1950), &quot;Aadhi Raat&quot; (1950), &quot;Chhoti Bhabi&quot; (1950), &quot;Afsana&quot; (1951), &quot;Aansoo&quot; (1953), and &quot;Adl-e-Jehangir&quot; (1955)), C. Ramchandra, Hemant Kumar, Salil Chowdhury, Datta Naik, Khayyam, Ravi, Sajjad Hussain, Roshan, Kalyanji-Anandji, Vasant Desai, Sudhir Phadke, Hansraj Behl, Madan Mohan, and Usha Khanna. She sang &quot;Sri Lanka, Ma Priyadara Jaya Bhumi&quot;, a song in Sinhala, for the 1955 Sri Lankan film &quot;Seda Sulang&quot;. Lata Didi recorded her first Telugu song &quot;Nidhurapora Thammudaa&quot; in 1955 Telugu film &quot;Santhanam&quot; for music director Susarla Dakshinamurthi. She made her debut in Tamil playback singing with &quot;Vanaradham&quot; in 1956 (&quot;Uran Khotala&quot; dubbed in Tamil) with the Tamil song &quot;Enthan Kannalan&quot; for &quot;Nimmi&quot; in the dubbed version composed by Naushad.
She sang many raga-based songs for Naushad in movies such as &quot;Deedar&quot; (1951), &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot; (1952), &quot;Amar&quot; (1954), &quot;Uran Khatola&quot; (1955) and &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957). &quot;Ae Chorre Ki Jaat Badi Bewafa&quot;, a duet with G. M. Durrani, was her first song for the composer Naushad. The duo, Shankar–Jaikishan, chose Lata for &quot;Barsaat&quot; (1949), &quot;Aah&quot; (1953), &quot;Shree 420&quot; (1955) and &quot;Chori Chori&quot; (1956). Before 1957, composer S. D. Burman chose her as the leading female singer for his musical scores in &quot;Sazaa&quot; (1951), &quot;House No. 44&quot; (1955), and &quot;Devdas&quot; (1955). However a rift developed between her and Burman in 1957, and she did not sing his compositions again until 1962.

She won a Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for Salil Chowdhury&#x27;s composition &quot;Aaja Re Pardesi&quot; from &quot;Madhumati&quot; (1958). Her association with C. Ramchandra produced songs in movies such as Albela (1951), Shin Shinkai Bublaa Boo (1952), Anarkali (1953), &quot;Pehli Jhhalak&quot; (1954), &quot;Azad&quot; (1955), &quot;Aasha&quot; (1957), and Amardeep (1958). For Madan Mohan, she performed for films like &quot;Baagi&quot; (1953), &quot;Railway Platform&quot; (1955), &quot;Pocketmaar&quot; (1956), &quot;Mr. Lambu&quot; (1956), &quot;Dekh Kabira Roya&quot; (1957), &quot;Adalat&quot; (1958), &quot;Jailor&quot; (1958), &quot;Mohar&quot; (1959), and &quot;Chacha Zindabad&quot; (1959).

Her song &quot;Aye Maalik Tere Bande Hum&quot; which was the original composition of Vasant Desai and used in the film &quot;Do Aankhen Barah Haath&quot; on 1957, was adapted by a Pakistani school as the school anthem.

=== 1960s ===
Mangeshkar&#x27;s song &quot;Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot; from &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960), composed by Naushad and lip-synced by Madhubala, still remains famous. The Hawaiian-themed number &quot;Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh&quot;, from &quot;Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai&quot; (1960), was composed by Shankar–Jaikishan and lip-synced by Meena Kumari.

In 1961, she recorded two popular bhajans, &quot;Allah Tero Naam&quot; and &quot;Prabhu Tero Naam&quot;, for Burman&#x27;s assistant, Jaidev. In 1962, she was awarded her second Filmfare Award for the song &quot;Kahin Deep Jale Kahin Dil&quot; from &quot;Bees Saal Baad&quot;, composed by Hemant Kumar.

On 27 January 1963, against the backdrop of the Sino-Indian War, she sang the patriotic song &quot;Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo&quot; (literally, &quot;Oh, People of My Country&quot;) in the presence of Jawaharlal Nehru, then the Prime Minister of India. The song, composed by C. Ramchandra and written by Kavi Pradeep, is said to have brought the Prime Minister to tears.

In 1963, she returned to collaborate with S. D. Burman. She had sung in R. D. Burman&#x27;s first film, &quot;Chhote Nawab&quot; (1961), and later in his films such as &quot;Bhoot Bungla&quot; (1965), &quot;Pati Patni&quot; (1966), &quot;Baharon ke Sapne&quot; (1967), and &quot;Abhilasha&quot; (1969). She also recorded several popular songs for S. D. Burman, including &quot;Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai&quot;, &quot;Gata Rahe Mera Dil&quot; (duet with Kishore Kumar) and &quot;Piya Tose&quot; from &quot;Guide&quot; (1965), &quot;Hothon Pe Aisi Baat&quot; from &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; (1967), and &quot;Kitni Akeli Kitni Tanhaa&quot; from &quot;Talash&quot;.

During the 1960s, she continued her association with Madan Mohan, which included the songs &quot;Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha&quot; from &quot;Anpadh&quot; (1962), &quot;Lag Jaa Gale&quot; and &quot;Naina Barse Rim Jhim&quot; from &quot;Woh Kaun Thi?&quot; (1964), &quot;Woh Chup Rahen To&quot; from &quot;Jahan Ara&quot; (1964), &quot;Tu Jahan Jahan Chalega&quot; from &quot;Mera Saaya&quot; (1966) and &quot;Teri Aankho Ke Siva&quot; from &quot;Chirag&quot; (1969), and she had a continuing association with the maestros Shankar Jaikishan, who got her to sing in various genres in the 1960s.

The 1960s also witnessed the beginning of her association with Laxmikant–Pyarelal, the music directors for whom she sang the most popular songs in her career. Starting in 1963, Laxmikant–Pyarelal&#x27;s association with Lata Mangeshkar grew stronger over the years. She sang over 700 songs for the composer duo over a period of 35 years, many of which became huge hits. She sang for &quot;Parasmani&quot; (1963), &quot;Mr. X in Bombay&quot; (1964), &quot;Aaye Din Bahar Ke&quot; (1966), &quot;Milan&quot; (1967), &quot;Anita&quot; (1967), &quot;Shagird&quot; (1968), &quot;Mere Hamdam Mere Dost&quot; (1968), &quot;Intaquam&quot; (1969), &quot;Do Raaste&quot; (1969) and &quot;Jeene Ki Raah&quot;, for which she got her third Filmfare Award. 

She also sang several playback songs for Marathi films, composed by Marathi music directors including Hridaynath Mangeshkar, Vasant Prabhu, Srinivas Khale, Sudhir Phadke, Bhaskar Chandavarkar, Datta Davjekar,Yashwant Dev, Ram Kadam, Prabhakar Jog and herself, under the pseudonym &quot;Anandghan&quot;. During the 1960s and 1970s, she also sang several Bengali songs composed by music directors like Salil Chowdhury and Hemant Kumar. 

She made her Kannada debut in 1967 for the film &quot;Kranthiveera Sangolli Rayanna&quot; by recording two songs for the music director Lakshman Berlekar. The song &quot;Bellane Belagayithu&quot; was well received and appreciated. 

In the 1960s, she recorded duets with Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor and Mohammed Rafi. For a brief period during the 1960s, she was not on good terms with Mohammed Rafi over the issue of royalty payments to singers. She wanted Rafi to back her in demanding a half-share from the five percent song royalty that the film&#x27;s producer conceded to select composers. But Rafi took a diametrically opposite view, and believed that a playback singer&#x27;s claim on the filmmaker ended with the payment of the agreed fee for the song, leading to tensions between the two. After an argument during the recording of the song &quot;Tasveer Teri Dil Mein&quot;, from Maya (1961), the two refused to sing with each other. The music director Shankar Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two. 

In 1969 he recorded Marathi song &quot;Mi Dolkara Daryacha Raja&quot; alongside Lata Mangeshkar, composed by Hridaynath Mangeshkar. Emerged as huge hit.

=== 1970s ===
In 1972, Meena Kumari&#x27;s last film, &quot;Pakeezah&quot;, was released. It featured popular songs including &quot;Chalte Chalte&quot; and &quot;Inhi Logon Ne&quot;, sung by Mangeshkar, and composed by Ghulam Mohammed. She recorded many popular songs for S. D. Burman&#x27;s last films, including &quot;Rangeela Re&quot; from &quot;Prem Pujari&quot; (1970), &quot;Khilte Hain Gul Yahaan&quot; from &quot;Sharmeelee&quot; (1971) and &quot;Piya Bina&quot; from &quot;Abhimaan&quot; (1973) and for Madan Mohan&#x27;s last films, including &quot;Dastak&quot; (1970), &quot;Heer Raanjha&quot; (1970), &quot;Dil Ki Rahen&quot; (1973), &quot;Hindustan Ki Kasam&quot; (1973), &quot;Hanste Zakhm&quot; (1973), &quot;Mausam&quot; (1975) and &quot;Laila Majnu&quot; (1976).

Many of her notable songs in the 1970s were composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal and Rahul Dev Burman. Many of her songs composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal in the 1970s were written by the lyricist Anand Bakshi. She also recorded many hit songs with Rahul Dev Burman in the films &quot;Amar Prem&quot; (1972), &quot;Caravan&quot; (1971), &quot;Kati Patang&quot; (1971), and &quot;Aandhi&quot; (1975). The two are noted for their songs with the lyricists Majrooh Sultanpuri, Anand Bakshi, and Gulzar.

In 1973, she won the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for the song &quot;Beeti Na Bitai&quot; from the film &quot;Parichay&quot;, composed by R. D. Burman, and written by Gulzar. In 1974, she sang her only Malayalam song &quot;Kadali Chenkadali&quot; for the film &quot;Nellu&quot;, composed by Salil Chowdhury, and written by Vayalar Ramavarma. In 1975, she again won the National Award, this time for the song &quot;Roothe Roothe Piya&quot; from the film &quot;Kora Kagaz&quot;, composed by Kalyanji Anandji.

From the 1970s onward, she also staged many concerts in India and abroad, including several charity concerts. She transformed the way Indian music concerts were perceived in the West. Her first concert overseas was at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 1974. (Despite some sources claiming that she was the first Indian to do so, according to the Hall&#x27;s own records, the first Indian to perform there was the late Ravi Shankar, on 21 October 1969.) Until that time, film music concerts were song-and-dance affairs held in community halls and colleges, rarely taken seriously. Mangeshkar demanded to sing in mainstream halls only, which was an honour that until then was bestowed only upon classical musicians.

She also released an album of Mirabai&#x27;s bhajans, &quot;Chala Vaahi Des&quot;, composed by her brother Hridaynath Mangeshkar. Some of the bhajans in the album include &quot;Saanware Rang Ranchi&quot; and &quot;Ud Jaa Re Kaaga&quot;. In the early 1970s, she released other non-film albums, such as her collection of Ghalib ghazals, an album of Marathi folk songs (Koli-geete), an album of Ganesh aartis (all composed by her brother Hridaynath) and an album of &quot;abhangs&quot; of Sant Tukaram composed by Shrinivas Khale.

In the 1978 Raj Kapoor-directed &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot;, she sang the main theme song &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram,&quot; among the chart-toppers of the year. The film&#x27;s story is inspired by her, according to Kapoor&#x27;s daughter Ritu Nanda in her book &quot;Raj Kapoor&quot;. The book quotes Kapoor as saying, &quot;I visualised the story of a man falling for a woman with an ordinary countenance but a golden voice and wanted to cast Lata Mangeshkar in the role.&quot;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she worked with the children of composers she had earlier worked with. Some of these composers included Rahul Dev Burman, son of Sachin Dev Burman, Rajesh Roshan, son of Roshan, Anu Malik, son of Sardar Malik, and Anand–Milind, sons of Chitragupta. She also sang many songs in the Assamese language and developed a very good relationship with the Assamese musician Bhupen Hazarika.

The later editions of Guinness Book stated that she had sung no fewer than 30,000 songs between 1948 and 1987.

The entry was discontinued by Guinness editions in 1991 without explanation, while several sources continued to claim that she recorded thousands of songs, with estimates ranging up to figures as large as 50,000. However, even the earliest Guinness claim of 25,000 songs (between 1948 and 1974) was disputed and claimed to have been exaggerated by several others, stating that the number of songs sung by her in Hindi films to 1991 was found to be 5025. Mangeshkar stated that she did not keep a record of the number of songs she recorded, and that she did not know from where Guinness Book editors got their information. In 2011, the entry was revived by &quot;Guinness&quot; crediting the record to her sister Asha Bhosle as the most recorded artist in music history, &quot;for recording up to 11,000 solo, duet and chorus-backed songs and in over 20 Indian languages since 1947&quot;. Since 2016, current record in this category belongs to
P. Susheela, for recording at least 17,695 songs in 6 languages, not counting some lost early recordings.

<text>In France, a subprefecture () is the commune which is the administrative centre of a departmental arrondissement that does not contain the prefecture for its department. The term also applies to the building that houses the administrative headquarters for an arrondissement.

The civil servant in charge of a subprefecture is the subprefect, assisted by a general secretary. Between May 1982 and February 1988, subprefects were known instead by the title Deputy Commissioner of the Republic (&quot;commissaire adjoint de la République&quot;). Where the administration of an arrondissement is carried out from a prefecture, the general secretary to the prefect carries out duties equivalent to those of the subprefect.

The municipal arrondissements of Paris, Lyon and Marseille are divisions of the commune rather than the prefecture. They are not arrondissements in the same sense.

<doc id="222793" wikidata="Q6080485" url="?curid=222793" title="Ishmael (Moby-Dick)">
<text>Ishmael is a character in Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851), which opens with the line &quot;Call me Ishmael.&quot; He is the first-person narrator of much of the book. Because Ishmael plays a minor role in the plot, early critics of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; assumed that Captain Ahab was the protagonist. Many either confused Ishmael with Melville or overlooked the role he played. Later critics distinguished Ishmael from Melville, and some saw his mystic and speculative consciousness as the novel&#x27;s central force rather than Captain Ahab&#x27;s monomaniacal force of will.

The Biblical name Ishmael has come to symbolize orphans, exiles, and social outcasts. By contrast with his eponym from the Book of Genesis, who is banished into the desert, Melville&#x27;s Ishmael wanders upon the sea. Each Ishmael, however, experiences a miraculous rescue; in the Bible from thirst, in the novel from drowning.

== Characteristics ==
Both Ahab and Ishmael are fascinated by the whale, but whereas Ahab perceives him exclusively as evil, Ishmael keeps an open mind. Ahab has a static world view, blind to new information, but Ishmael&#x27;s world view is constantly in flux as new insights and realizations occur. &quot;And flux in turn ... is the chief characteristic of Ishmael himself.&quot; In the chapter &quot;The Doubloon&quot;, Ishmael reports how each spectator sees his own personality reflected in the coin, but does not look at it himself. Fourteen chapters later, in &quot;The Gilder&quot;, he participates in &quot;what is clearly a recapitulation&quot; of the earlier chapter. The difference is that the surface of the golden sea in &quot;The Gilder&quot; is alive, whereas the surface of the doubloon is unalterably fixed, &quot;only one of several contrasts between Ishmael and Ahab.&quot;

Ishmael meditates on a wide range of topics. In addition to explicitly philosophical references, in Chapter 89, for instance, he expounds on the legal concept, &quot;Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish&quot;, which he takes to mean that possession, rather than a moral claim, bestows the right of ownership.

== Biography ==
Ishmael, like Melville, first worked as a school teacher before securing a position on a merchant vessel. After several voyages in the merchant service, he decides to sail as a green hand on a whaling ship, leaving from Nantucket.

Ishmael first travels from Manhattan Island to New Bedford. The inn is crowded, and he must share a bed with the tattooed Polynesian, Queequeg, a harpooneer whom Ishmael assumes to be a cannibal. Two days later Ishmael and Queequeg head for Nantucket. Ishmael signs up for a voyage on the whaler &quot;Pequod&quot;, under Captain Ahab. Ahab is obsessed by the white whale, Moby Dick, who on a previous voyage had severed his leg. In his quest for revenge Ahab has lost all sense of responsibility, and when the whale sinks the ship and destroys the whaleboats, all crewmembers drown with the exception of Ishmael: &quot;And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.&quot; A life buoy fashioned from Queequeg&#x27;s coffin
bobs up to the surface, and Ishmael keeps himself afloat on it until another whaling ship, the &quot;Rachel&quot;, arrives to rescue him.

==Family==
The only family Ishmael mentions include an unnamed stepmother and an uncle, Captain (John) D&#x27;Wolf. John D&#x27;Wolf, in reality, was Melville&#x27;s uncle, having married his paternal aunt Mary. Ishmael, writing the narrative of the book as an older man, also implies in Chapter 35 that he&#x27;s a father (&quot;we fathers being the original inventors and patentees...&quot;). 

==Ishmael (Old Testament)==

The name Ishmael is Biblical in origin: in Genesis 16:1-16; 17:18-25; 21:6-21; 25:9-17, Ishmael was the son of Abraham by the servant Hagar. In 21:6-21, the most significant verses for Melville&#x27;s allegory, Hagar was cast off after the birth of Isaac, who inherited the covenant of the Lord instead of his older half-brother.

Melville shapes his allegory to the Biblical Ishmael as follows:
* Biblical Ishmael is banished to &quot;the wilderness of Beer-sheba&quot;, while the narrator of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; wanders, in his own words, in &quot;the wilderness of waters.&quot; In the Bible, the desert or wilderness is a common setting for a vision of one kind or another. By contrast, Melville&#x27;s Ishmael takes to sea searching for insights.
* In Genesis, Hagar was visited by an angel who instructed her to call her still unborn child &quot;Yishma&#x27;el&quot;, meaning &quot;God shall hear&quot;. This prophecy was fulfilled when Ishmael, perishing in the desert, was saved by a miracle: the sudden appearance of a well of water. In &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, only Ishmael escapes the sinking of the &quot;Pequod&quot;, which is described as &quot;that by a margin so narrow as to seem miraculous.&quot;
*In direct translation from the Hebrew Bible about Ishmael: &quot;His hand in all, and the hand of all in him.&quot;

The name further points to a Biblical analogy that marks Ishmael as the prototype of &quot;wanderer and outcast&quot;, the man set at odds with his fellows. Nathalia Wright says that all Melville&#x27;s heroes—with the exception of Benito Cereno and Billy Budd—are manifestations of the Biblical Ishmael, and four are actually identified with him: Redburn, Ishmael, Pierre, and Pitch from &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot;.

==Critical views==
During the early decades of the Melville revival, readers and critics often confused Ishmael with Melville, whose works were perceived as autobiography. The critic F.O. Matthiessen complained as early as 1941 that &quot;most of the criticism of our past masters has been perfunctorily tacked onto biographies&quot; and objected to the &quot;modern fallacy&quot; of the &quot;direct reading of an author&#x27;s personal life into his works.&quot; In 1948 Howard P. Vincent, in his study &quot;The Trying-Out of Moby-Dick&quot;, &quot;warned against forgetting the narrator&quot;, that is, assuming that Ishmael was merely describing what he saw. Robert Zoellner pointed out that Ishmael&#x27;s role as narrator &quot;breaks down&quot; either when Ahab and Stubb &quot;have a conversation off by themselves&quot; in chapter 29 or else when Ishmael reports &quot;the soliloquy of Ahab sitting alone&quot; in chapter 37.

Views also differ as to whether the protagonist is Ishmael or Ahab. M.H. Abrams finds Ishmael is &quot;only a minor or peripheral&quot; participant in the story he tells, but Walter Bezanson argues that the novel is not so much about Ahab or the White Whale as it is about Ishmael, who is &quot;the real center of meaning and the defining force of the novel.&quot;

Bezanson argues that there are two Ishmaels. The first is the narrator, &quot;the enfolding sensibility of the novel&quot; and &quot;the imagination through which all matters of the book pass.&quot; The reader is not told how long after the voyage Ishmael begins to tell his adventure, the second sentence&#x27;s &quot;some years ago&quot; being the only clue. The &quot;second Ishmael&quot;, continues Bezanson, is &quot;forecastle Ishmael&quot;, or the &quot;younger Ishmael of &#x27;some years ago.&#x27;... Narrator Ishmael is merely young Ishmael grown older.&quot; Forecastle Ishmael is &quot;simply one of the characters in the novel, though, to be sure, a major one whose significance is possibly next to Ahab&#x27;s.&quot; From time to time there are shifts of tense to indicate that &quot;while forecastle Ishmael is busy hunting whales, narrator Ishmael is sifting memory and imagination in search of the many meanings of the dark adventure he has experienced.&quot;

In a 1986 essay, Bezanson calls Ishmael an innocent &quot;and not even particularly interesting except as the narrator, a mature and complex sensibility, examines his inner life from a distance, just as he examines the inner life of Ahab...&quot;

John Bryant points out that as the novel progresses the central character is &quot;flip-flopping from Ishmael to Ahab&quot;. The beginning of the book is &quot;comedy&quot; in which anxious Ishmael and serene Queequeg &quot;bed down, get &#x27;married,&#x27; and take off on a whaling adventure come-what-may.&quot; After Ahab enters in Ch. 29, Ishmael, who does not reappear until Ch. 41, is no longer the &quot;central character&quot;, but the novel&#x27;s &quot;central consciousness and narrative voice&quot;. As his role as a character erodes, says Bryant, &quot;his life as a lyrical, poetic meditator upon whales and whaling transforms the novel once again...&quot; Ishmael wrestles with the realization that he cannot follow Ahab to a fiery doom but must be content with &quot;attainable felicity&quot;, (Ch. 94) but Ahab then takes over once more.

Narrator-Ishmael demonstrates &quot;an insatiable curiosity&quot; and an &quot;inexhaustible sense of wonder&quot;, says Bezanson, but has not yet fully understood his adventures: &quot;&#x27;It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.&#x27;&quot; This Ishmael must not be equated with Melville himself: &quot;we resist any one-to-one equation of Melville and Ishmael.&quot; Bezanson does attribute characteristic Melvillean features to the narrator, who in the Epilogue, likens himself to &quot;another Ixion&quot;.

Bezanson also insists that it would be a mistake &quot;to think the narrator indifferent to how his tale is told.&quot; Earlier critics charged that Melville did not pay a great deal of attention to point of view, &quot;and of course this is true&quot; in Henry James&#x27;s sense of the technique, yet Ishmael-narrator&#x27;s &quot;struggle&quot; with the shaping of his narrative, &quot;under constant discussion, is itself one of the major themes of the book.&quot; Ishmael deploys among other genres and styles, a sermon, a dream, a comic set-piece, a midnight ballet, a meditation, an emblematic reading.

<doc id="222800" wikidata="Q841753" url="?curid=222800" title="Governorates of Iraq">
<text>Iraq consists of 18 recognized governorates (; ), also known as &quot;provinces&quot; and 1 partially recognized governorate (Halabja). Per the Iraqi constitution, governorates can form a federal region. Four governorates, Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, Halabja and Duhok, constitute the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region. Baghdad (which is the most populous) and Basra are the oldest governorates. The second most-populous one, Ninawa (or Nineveh) is in the upland region and has a cooler climate of the north-west.

There have been numerous calls to recognize Halabja Governorate since 1999. It was recognized as an official governorate of the Kurdistan Region in 2014, and the Council of Ministers approved a bill twice in 2013, and 2023. However, the only legislature in Iraq that can implement new governorates is the Council of Representatives of Iraq, which has had delayed hearings regarding Halabja numerous times.

== History ==

Throughout early 2014, the Council of Ministers of Iraq approved proposals to add the three newly proposed governorates:
*Tal Afar, from part of Ninawa Governorate 
*Tuz Khurmatu, from part of Saladin Governorate
*Nineveh Plains from the Ninawa Governorate.
*Halabja from Sulaymaniah Governorate

In 2013, activists and political parties called for the conversion of Hawija from a District into a governorate, but the Kirkuk government blocked the proposal. 

Shortly after the approval of the proposals, the Islamic State attacked the cities, towns and villages of the Nineveh Plains. Upon the eventual withdrawal of ISIS, the initial decision by the Council of Ministers was dishonored by Kurdistan, Baghdad and Iranian-connected political entities, as they began pushing security forces into different parts of the Nineveh Plains to try and lay claim to different parts of the territory, asserting that the demographics had changed due to ISIS and that the original inhabitants could no longer be representatives of their indigenous land. Part of the reason for the demographic shift was that squatters were encouraged to occupy Christian homes. Without enough paperwork to prove ownership, some of those homes became extremely challenging to reclaim. Initiatives are underway to help reclaim families&#x27; homes.

Another proposal exists to add a 19th governorate: Fallujah, from part of the Al Anbar. This largely did not occur due to the ISIS insurgency. Following the defeat of ISIS in the Battle of Fallujah (2016), the proposal may resurface or Al-Anbar may remain undivided.

<text>Deng Pufang () (born 16 April 1944) is a Chinese politician, who is the eldest son of former Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. He is mostly known for being injured during the Cultural Revolution by the Red Guards and becoming a paraplegic. He has since dedicated his life to improving the rights of people with disabilities.

==Biography==
Deng Pufang was born to Deng Xiaoping and Zhuo Lin, in Yuntoudi Village, Mataian Town, Liao County, Jinzhong, Shanxi. The name &quot;Pufang&quot; was given to him by Liu Bocheng, in the sense of &quot;purity and squareness&quot;.

As a young boy, he attended the Beijing 13 Middle School. In 1962, he enrolled in the Department of Technical Physics of Peking University and joined the Chinese Communist Party in September 1965.

During the Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping and his family were targeted by Mao Zedong. He was branded as a capitalist roader. In one session, he was forced to kneel to the ground with his arm stretched out behind him and over his head. His family watched as the students forced him to confess to capitalist ways of thinking.

Mao&#x27;s Red Guards then imprisoned Deng Pufang. He was tortured and thrown out of the window of a three-story building at Peking University in 1968. His back broken, he was rushed to the hospital, but was denied admission. By the time he reached another clinic, he was paralyzed. He remains a paraplegic, using a wheelchair.

With regard to his views on the Cultural Revolution, Deng Pufang once said, &quot;The generation of the Cultural Revolution is in no sense a lost generation, as is often said. Quite to the contrary. All those who passed through that testing have been toughened. These people think a great deal, and have their own ideas. They are firm in their convictions, and show initiative. To my way of thinking this generation represents a trump card for China and for the reforms which they have set in motion.&quot;
In 1984 Deng Pufang established the China Welfare Fund for the Disabled. 
It was in 1975 that Deng was given the opportunity to work, serving in the Administrative and Economic Management Department of the General Office of the Central Military Commission. In 1984, he became a vice president of the China Welfare Fund for the Disabled as a vice-ministerial cadre at the age of 40; the following year, he was promoted to president of the foundation; and since 2006, he has been the president of the foundation. He also founded and became the chairman of the China Disabled Persons&#x27; Federation in 1988.

In 1987, he was the prime mover behind a national survey for people with disabilities. Deng also visited the United States to publicize the challenges of disabled people in China and learn about relevant practices in the United States. In 1990, he led the formation of the Chinese Rehabilitation and Research Association for the Mentally Disabled. In 1991, legislation was passed to recognize mental illness as a disability.

He was awarded the United Nations Human Rights Prize in December 2003 for his work in protecting the rights of individuals with disability in China.

In March 2008, at the first session of the Eleventh National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Deng Pufang was elected Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference. At the Fifth National Congress of the China Disabled Persons&#x27; Federation, held in November of the same year, he was elected Honorary Chairman of the Bureau. Deng also helped organize the 2008 Beijing Olympics as the executive president of the Beijing Organizing Committee.

In September 2023, at the age of 79, Deng Pufang stepped down as Honorary Chairman of the China Disabled Persons&#x27; Federation.

<doc id="222811" wikidata="Q924673" url="?curid=222811" title="New York Herald">
<text>The New York Herald was a large-distribution newspaper based in New York City that existed between 1835 and 1924. At that point it was acquired by its smaller rival the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; to form the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;.

==History==

The first issue of the paper was published by James Gordon Bennett Sr., on May 6, 1835. The &quot;Herald&quot; distinguished itself from the partisan papers of the day by the policy that it published in its first issue: &quot;We shall support no party—be the agent of no faction or coterie, and we care nothing for any election, or any candidate from president down to constable,&quot; although it was typically considered sympathetic to the Jacksonian Democratic Party and later, President John Tyler. Bennett pioneered the &quot;extra&quot; edition during the &quot;Herald&quot;&#x27;s sensational coverage of the Robinson–Jewett murder case.

By 1845 it was the most popular and profitable daily newspaper in the United States. In 1861 it circulated 84,000 copies and called itself &quot;the most largely circulated journal in the world.&quot; Bennett stated that the function of a newspaper &quot;is not to instruct but to startle and amuse.&quot; His politics tended to be anti-Catholic and he had tended to favor the &quot;Know Nothing&quot; faction, but he was not so anti-immigrant as the Know-Nothing Native American Party. During the American Civil War, Bennett&#x27;s policy, as expressed by the newspaper, was to staunchly support the Democratic Party. Frederic Hudson served as managing editor of the paper from 1846 to 1866. During the mid-19th century, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; adopted a proslavery stance, with Bennett arguing that the Compromise of 1850 would lead to &quot;but little anxiety entertained in relation to the question of slavery, the public mind will be so fatigued that it will be disinclined to think of the matter any further.&quot;

In April 1867 Bennett turned over control of the paper to his son James Gordon Bennett Jr. Under James Jr., the paper financed Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s expeditions into Africa to find explorer David Livingstone, where they met on November 10, 1871. The paper also supported Stanley&#x27;s trans-Africa exploration. In 1879 it supported the ill-fated expedition of George W. De Long to the Arctic region.

In 1874 the &quot;Herald&quot; ran the New York Zoo hoax, in which the front page of the newspaper was devoted entirely to a fabricated story of wild animals getting loose at the Central Park Zoo and attacking numerous people.

On October 4, 1887, Bennett Jr. sent Julius Chambers to Paris, France, to launch its European Edition. Later he moved to Paris himself, but the &quot;New York Herald&quot; suffered from his attempt to manage its operation in New York by telegram. In 1916 a Saturday issue of the paper reported that a major financier was found dead from poisoning; it added that in 1901 he was &quot;mysteriously poisoned and narrowly escaped death.&quot;

After Bennett Jr. died in 1918, Frank Munsey acquired control of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; (including its European Edition). In 1924 Munsey sold the paper to the family of Ogden Reid, owners of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, creating the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; (and the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; with a divergent future).

When the &quot;Herald&quot; was still under the authority of its original publisher Bennett Sr., it was considered to be the most intrusive and sensationalist of the leading New York papers. Its ability to entertain the public with timely daily news made it the leading circulation paper of its period.

==European edition==

During the time of original publisher Bennett, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; was perhaps the best-known American paper in Europe. Its first issue came out on October 4, 1887. The official name of the paper on its front page masthead was The New York Herald European Edition—Paris. But it became widely known as simply the &quot;Paris Herald&quot;.

Publisher Bennett Jr. referred to the paper as a &quot;village publication&quot; for the circle of people in Paris who were interested in international news. Indeed, during its first decades of publication, a feature of the paper was a list of every American known to be in Paris at the time, culled from inspections of hotel registries. Even as the paper&#x27;s audience grew, most of its readers were in France or countries near France.

The European edition consistently lost money into the 1910s. As the time of Paris in World War I began, Bennett Jr. kept the paper running, even during the First Battle of the Marne when some French papers shut down. When the American Expeditionary Forces began arriving in France in 1917, demand for the &quot;Paris Herald&quot; soared, with eventually some 350,000 copies being printed each day and the edition finally becoming profitable.

The European edition subsequently became a mainstay of American expatriate culture in Europe. In Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1926), the first thing the novel&#x27;s protagonist Jake Barnes does on returning from Spain to France is buy the &quot;New York Herald&quot; from a kiosk in Bayonne in the Basses-Pyrénées department and read it at a café.

==&quot;Evening Telegram&quot;==
The &quot;New York Evening Telegram&quot; was founded in 1867 by the junior Bennett, and was considered by many to be an evening edition of the &quot;Herald&quot;. Frank Munsey acquired the &quot;Telegram&quot; in 1920 and ended its connection to the &quot;Herald&quot;.

==Commemorated==

*New York&#x27;s Herald Square is named after the &quot;New York Herald&quot; newspaper. 
*The New York Herald Building was designed by the prestigious firm of Stanford White, and completed in 1908. It occupied the north side of the square. At its top was the sculpture, &quot;Minerva and the Bellringers&quot;, by Antonin Carlès, which sounded every hour with bellringing. After the building was demolished in 1921 to make way for other development, the James Gordon Bennett Memorial featuring the sculpture was installed on the north side of Herald Square in 1940 to commemorate the Bennetts.
*The chorus of &quot;Give My Regards to Broadway&quot; includes the phrase &quot;[R]emember me to Herald Square.&quot; North of Herald Square is Times Square, which is named after the rival &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

<doc id="222823" wikidata="Q432768" url="?curid=222823" title="Mildred Gillars">
<text>Mildred Elizabeth Gillars (; November 29, 1900 – June 25, 1988) was an American broadcaster employed by Nazi Germany to disseminate Axis propaganda during World War II. Following her capture in post-war Berlin, Gillars became the first woman to be convicted of treason against the United States. In March 1949, she was sentenced to ten to thirty years&#x27; imprisonment. Gillars was paroled in 1961. Along with Rita Zucca she was nicknamed &quot;Axis Sally&quot;.

==Early life==
She was born Mildred Elizabeth Sisk in Portland, Maine, to parents Vincent Sisk and Mae Hewitson. After her mother and father divorced, she took the surname Gillars in 1911 when her mother married Robert Bruce Gillars. Her family resided in Bellevue, Ohio, where Robert Gillars was a dentist. 

At 16, she moved to Conneaut, Ohio, with her family. In 1918, she enrolled at Ohio Wesleyan University to study dramatic arts, but left without graduating. 

Gillars then moved to Greenwich Village, New York City, where she worked in various low-skilled jobs to finance drama lessons. She toured with stock companies and appeared in vaudeville but was unable to establish a theatrical career. Gillars also worked as an artist&#x27;s model for sculptor Mario Korbel but was unable to find regular employment.

In 1929, she moved to France and lived in Paris for six months. In 1933, Gillars left the United States again, residing first in Algiers where she found work as a dressmaker&#x27;s assistant.

In 1934, she moved to Dresden, Germany, to study music and was later employed as a teacher of English, at the Berlitz School of Languages in Berlin.

==Work as a Nazi propagandist==
On 6 May 1940, Gillars obtained work as an announcer with the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (RRG), German State Radio. She became their highest paid employee, and sometimes went by the name of &quot;Midge at the mike&quot;.

By 1941, the U.S. State Department was advising American nationals to leave Germany and German-controlled territories. However, Gillars chose to remain because her fiancé Paul Karlson, a naturalized German citizen, said he would never marry her if she returned to the United States. Shortly afterwards, Karlson was sent to the Eastern Front, where he was killed in action.

Gillars&#x27;s initial broadcasts were largely apolitical, but started with the phrase &quot;this is Berlin calling&quot;. Eventually, she started a relationship with Max Otto Koischwitz, the German-American program director in the USA Zone at the RRG. In 1942, Koischwitz cast Gillars in a new show called &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; and included her in his political broadcasts. Gillars soon acquired several names amongst her GI audience, including the &quot;Bitch of Berlin&quot;, &quot;Berlin Babe&quot;, &quot;Olga&quot;, and &quot;Sally&quot;, but the most common was &quot;Axis Sally&quot;. This name probably came when asked on air to describe herself, Gillars said she was &quot;the Irish type ... a real Sally.&quot; Gillars expressed anti-Semitic sentiments during her broadcasts. During one broadcast, she said &quot;I say damn Roosevelt and Churchill, and all of their Jews who have made this war possible.&quot;

In 1943, an Italian-American woman, Rita Zucca, also began broadcasting to American forces from Rome using the name &quot;Sally&quot;. The two often were confused with each other and even thought by many to be one and the same, though Gillars was annoyed another woman was broadcasting under her name.

Gillars&#x27;s main programs from Berlin were:
* &quot;Home Sweet Home Hour&quot;, from December 24, 1942, until 1945, a regular propaganda program aimed at making U.S. forces in Europe feel homesick and discouraged. A running theme of these broadcasts was the infidelity of soldiers&#x27; wives and sweethearts while the listeners were stationed in Europe and North Africa. She questioned whether the women would remain faithful, &quot;especially if you boys get all mutilated and do not return in one piece&quot;. Opening with the sound of a train whistle, &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; attempted to exploit the fears of American soldiers about the home front. The broadcasts were designed to make soldiers feel doubt about their mission, their leaders, and their prospects after the war.
* &quot;Midge at the Mike&quot;, broadcast from March to late fall 1943, in which she played American songs interspersed with defeatist propaganda, anti-Semitic rhetoric, and attacks on Franklin D. Roosevelt.
* &quot;GI&#x27;s Letter-box&quot; and &quot;Medical Reports&quot; (1944), directed at the U.S. home audience in which Gillars used information on wounded and captured U.S. airmen to cause fear and worry in their families. After D-Day (June 6, 1944), Gillars and Koischwitz worked for a time from Chartres and Paris for this purpose, visiting hospitals and interviewing POWs, falsely claiming to be a representative of the International Red Cross. In 1943, they had toured POW camps in Germany, interviewing captured Americans and recording their messages for their families in the U.S. The interviews were then edited for broadcast as though the speakers were well-treated or sympathetic to the Nazi cause.

Gillars made her most famous broadcast on May 11, 1944, a few weeks prior to the D-Day invasion of Normandy, in a radio play written by Koischwitz called &quot;Vision of Invasion&quot;. She played Evelyn, an Ohio mother, who dreams that her son had died a horrific death on a ship in the English Channel during an attempted invasion of Occupied Europe. He came to her after his death in the dream and told her of the horror he saw, whilst in the background there were shrieks and moans of men suffering in battle.

Koischwitz died in August 1944 and Gillars&#x27;s broadcasts became lackluster and repetitive without his creative energy. She remained in Berlin until the end of the war. Her last broadcast was on May 6, 1945, just two days before the surrender of Germany.

==Arrest, trial, and imprisonment==
The U.S. attorney general dispatched prosecutor Victor C. Woerheide to Berlin to find and arrest Gillars. He and Counterintelligence Corps special agent Hans Winzen only had one solid lead: Raymond Kurtz, a B-17 pilot shot down by the Germans, recalled that a woman who had visited his prison camp seeking interviews was the broadcaster who called herself &quot;Midge at the Mike&quot;, and had used the alias Barbara Mome. Woerheide organized wanted posters with Gillars&#x27;s picture to put up in Berlin, and the breakthrough came when he was informed that a woman calling herself &quot;Barbara Mome&quot; was selling her furniture at second-hand markets around the city. A shop owner whose stock contained a table belonging to Gillars was detained and under &quot;intensive interrogation&quot; revealed Gillars&#x27;s address. When she was arrested on March 15, 1946, Gillars only asked to take with her a picture of Koischwitz.

She was then held by the Counterintelligence Corps at Camp King, Oberursel, along with collaborators Herbert John Burgman and Donald S. Day, until she was conditionally released from custody on December 24, 1946; however, she declined to leave military detention. She was abruptly re-arrested on January 22, 1947, after being offered conditional release by the United States at the request of the Justice Department and was eventually flown to the United States on August 21, 1948, to await trial on charges of aiding the German war effort.

Gillars was indicted on September 10, 1948, and charged with ten counts of treason, but only eight were used at her trial, which began on January 25, 1949. The prosecution relied on the large number of her programs recorded by the Federal Communications Commission, stationed in Silver Hill, Maryland, to show her participation in propaganda activities directed at the United States. It was also shown that Gillars had taken an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler. The defense stated that her broadcasts stated unpopular opinions, but did not amount to treasonable conduct. They also argued that she was under the hypnotic influence of Koischwitz and therefore not fully responsible for her actions until after his death. On March 10, 1949, the jury convicted Gillars on just one count of treason, that of making the &quot;Vision of Invasion&quot; broadcast. She was stripped of her US citizenship, was sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison and a $10,000 fine ($ today). The judge spared Gillars from a harsher sentence since she had not participated in high-level Nazi propaganda policy conferences as was the case with Douglas Chandler and Robert Henry Best. In 1950, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the conviction.

Gillars served her sentence at the Federal Reformatory for Women in Alderson, West Virginia. She became eligible for parole in 1959, but did not apply until 1961. She was released on June 10, 1961.

==Later life==
Having converted to Catholicism while in prison, Gillars went to live at the Our Lady of Bethlehem Convent in Columbus, Ohio, and taught German, French, and music at St. Joseph Academy, Columbus. In 1973, aged 72, she returned to Ohio Wesleyan University to complete her degree, a Bachelor of Arts in speech.

Throughout her life Gillars was unapologetic about her association with Nazism. Shortly before her death, a neighbour claimed that she showed her a cup that she described as one of her most cherished possessions. She said that it had been given to her by Heinrich Himmler, leader of the SS. Gillars died of colon cancer at Grant Medical Center in Columbus on June 25, 1988.

==Film==
Gillars&#x27;s wartime broadcasts and trial are the subject of the 2021 legal drama &quot;American Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally&quot;.

<text>Unit testing, component or module testing, is a form of software testing by which isolated source code is tested to validate expected behavior.

Unit testing describes tests that are run at the unit-level to contrast testing at the integration or system level.

== History ==
Unit testing, as a principle for testing separately smaller parts of large software systems dates back to the early days of software engineering. In June 1956, H.D. Benington presented at US Navy&#x27;s Symposium on Advanced Programming Methods for Digital Computers the SAGE project and its specification based approach where the coding phase was followed by &quot;parameter testing&quot; to validate component subprograms against their specification, followed then by an &quot;assembly testing&quot; for parts put together. 

In 1964, a similar approach is described for the software of the Mercury project, where individual units developed by different programmes underwent &quot;unit tests&quot; before being integrated together. In 1969, testing methodologies appear more structured, with unit tests, component tests and integration tests with the purpose of validating individual parts written separately and their progressive assembly into larger blocks. Some public standards adopted end of the 60&#x27;s, such as MIL-STD-483 and MIL-STD-490 contributed further to a wide acceptance of unit testing in large projects. 

Unit testing was in those times interactive or automated, using either coded tests or capture and replay testing tools. In 1989, Kent Beck described a testing framework for Smalltalk (later called SUnit) in &quot;Simple Smalltalk Testing: With Patterns&quot;. In 1997, Kent Beck and Erich Gamma developed and released JUnit, a unit test framework that became popular with Java developers. Google embraced automated testing around 2005–2006.

== Unit ==
Unit is defined as a single behaviour exhibited by the system under test (SUT), usually corresponding to a requirement. While it may imply that it is a function or a module (in procedural programming) or a method or a class (in object-oriented programming) it does not mean functions/methods, modules or classes always correspond to units. From the system-requirements perspective only the perimeter of the system is relevant, thus only entry points to externally-visible system behaviours define units.

== Execution ==
Unit tests can be performed manually or via automated test execution. Automated tests include benefits such as: running tests often, running tests without staffing cost, and consistent and repeatable testing.

Testing is often performed by the programmer who writes and modifies the code under test.
Unit testing may be viewed as part of the process of writing code.

== Testing criteria ==

During development, a programmer may code criteria, or results that are known to be good, into the test to verify the unit&#x27;s correctness. 

During test execution, frameworks log tests that fail any criterion and report them in a summary. 

For this, the most commonly used approach is test - function - expected value.

== Test case ==
== Test double ==
== Parameterized test ==
A parameterized test is a test that accepts a set of values that can be used to enable the test to run with multiple, different input values. A testing framework that supports parametrized tests supports a way to encode parameter sets and to run the test with each set.

Use of parametrized tests can reduce test code duplication.

Parameterized tests are supported by TestNG, JUnit, XUnit and NUnit, as well as in various JavaScript test frameworks.

Parameters for the unit tests may be coded manually or in some cases are automatically generated by the test framework. In recent years support was added for writing more powerful (unit) tests, leveraging the concept of theories, test cases that execute the same steps, but using test data generated at runtime, unlike regular parameterized tests that use the same execution steps with input sets that are pre-defined.

== Agile ==

Sometimes, in the agile software development, unit testing is done per user story and comes in the later half of the sprint after requirements gathering and development are complete. Typically, the developers or other members from the development team, such as consultants, will write step-by-step &#x27;test scripts&#x27; for the developers to execute in the tool. Test scripts are generally written to prove the effective and technical operation of specific developed features in the tool, as opposed to full fledged business processes that would be interfaced by the end user, which is typically done during user acceptance testing. If the test-script can be fully executed from start to finish without incident, the unit test is considered to have &quot;passed&quot;, otherwise errors are noted and the user story is moved back to development in an &#x27;in-progress&#x27; state. User stories that successfully pass unit tests are moved on to the final steps of the sprint - Code review, peer review, and then lastly a &#x27;show-back&#x27; session demonstrating the developed tool to stakeholders.

== Test-driven development ==

In test-driven development (TDD), unit tests are written while the production code is written. Starting with working code, the developer adds test code for a required behavior, then adds &quot;just enough&quot; code to make the test pass, then refactors the code (including test code) as makes sense and then repeats by adding another test.

== Value ==
Unit testing is intended to ensure that the units meet their design and behave as intended.

By writing tests first for the smallest testable units, then the compound behaviors between those, one can build up comprehensive tests for complex applications.

One goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct. A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy.

=== Early detection of problems in the development cycle ===
Unit testing finds problems early in the development cycle. This includes both bugs in the programmer&#x27;s implementation and flaws or missing parts of the specification for the unit. The process of writing a thorough set of tests forces the author to think through inputs, outputs, and error conditions, and thus more crisply define the unit&#x27;s desired behavior.

=== Reduced cost ===
The cost of finding a bug before coding begins or when the code is first written is considerably lower than the cost of detecting, identifying, and correcting the bug later. Bugs in released code may also cause costly problems for the end-users of the software. Code can be impossible or difficult to unit test if poorly written, thus unit testing can force developers to structure functions and objects in better ways.

=== More frequent releases ===
Unit testing enables more frequent releases in software development. By testing individual components in isolation, developers can quickly identify and address issues, leading to faster iteration and release cycles.

=== Allows for code refactoring ===
Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code or upgrade system libraries at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly (e.g., in regression testing). The procedure is to write test cases for all functions and methods so that whenever a change causes a fault, it can be identified quickly. 

=== Detects changes which may break a design contract ===
Unit tests detect changes which may break a design contract.

=== Reduce uncertainty ===
Unit testing may reduce uncertainty in the units themselves and can be used in a bottom-up testing style approach. By testing the parts of a program first and then testing the sum of its parts, integration testing becomes much easier.

=== Documentation of system behavior ===
Some programmers contend that unit tests provide a form of documentation of the code. Developers wanting to learn what functionality is provided by a unit, and how to use it, can review the unit tests to gain an understanding of it.

Test cases can embody characteristics that are critical to the success of the unit. These characteristics can indicate appropriate/inappropriate use of a unit as well as negative behaviors that are to be trapped by the unit. A test case documents these critical characteristics, although many software development environments do not rely solely upon code to document the product in development.

In some processes, the act of writing tests and the code under test, plus associated refactoring, may take the place of formal design. Each unit test can be seen as a design element specifying classes, methods, and observable behavior.

== Limitations and disadvantages ==
Testing will not catch every error in the program, because it cannot evaluate every execution path in any but the most trivial programs. This problem is a superset of the halting problem, which is undecidable. The same is true for unit testing. Additionally, unit testing by definition only tests the functionality of the units themselves. Therefore, it will not catch integration errors or broader system-level errors (such as functions performed across multiple units, or non-functional test areas such as performance). Unit testing should be done in conjunction with other software testing activities, as they can only show the presence or absence of particular errors; they cannot prove a complete absence of errors. To guarantee correct behavior for every execution path and every possible input, and ensure the absence of errors, other techniques are required, namely the application of formal methods to prove that a software component has no unexpected behavior.

An elaborate hierarchy of unit tests does not equal integration testing. Integration with peripheral units should be included in integration tests, but not in unit tests. Integration testing typically still relies heavily on humans testing manually; high-level or global-scope testing can be difficult to automate, such that manual testing often appears faster and cheaper.

Software testing is a combinatorial problem. For example, every Boolean decision statement requires at least two tests: one with an outcome of &quot;true&quot; and one with an outcome of &quot;false&quot;. As a result, for every line of code written, programmers often need 3 to 5 lines of test code. This obviously takes time and its investment may not be worth the effort. There are problems that cannot easily be tested at all – for example those that are nondeterministic or involve multiple threads. In addition, code for a unit test is as likely to be buggy as the code it is testing. Fred Brooks in &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; quotes: &quot;Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.&quot; Meaning, if two chronometers contradict, how do you know which one is correct?

=== Difficulty in setting up realistic and useful tests ===
Another challenge related to writing the unit tests is the difficulty of setting up realistic and useful tests. It is necessary to create relevant initial conditions so the part of the application being tested behaves like part of the complete system. If these initial conditions are not set correctly, the test will not be exercising the code in a realistic context, which diminishes the value and accuracy of unit test results.

=== Requires discipline throughout the development process ===
To obtain the intended benefits from unit testing, rigorous discipline is needed throughout the software development process.

=== Requires version control ===
It is essential to keep careful records not only of the tests that have been performed, but also of all changes that have been made to the source code of this or any other unit in the software. Use of a version control system is essential. If a later version of the unit fails a particular test that it had previously passed, the version-control software can provide a list of the source code changes (if any) that have been applied to the unit since that time.

=== Requires regular reviews ===
It is also essential to implement a sustainable process for ensuring that test case failures are reviewed regularly and addressed immediately. If such a process is not implemented and ingrained into the team&#x27;s workflow, the application will evolve out of sync with the unit test suite, increasing false positives and reducing the effectiveness of the test suite.

=== Limitations for embedded system software ===
Unit testing embedded system software presents a unique challenge: Because the software is being developed on a different platform than the one it will eventually run on, you cannot readily run a test program in the actual deployment environment, as is possible with desktop programs.

=== Limitations for testing integration with external systems ===
Unit tests tend to be easiest when a method has input parameters and some output. It is not as easy to create unit tests when a major function of the method is to interact with something external to the application. For example, a method that will work with a database might require a mock up of database interactions to be created, which probably won&#x27;t be as comprehensive as the real database interactions.

== Examples ==

=== JUnit ===
Below is an example of a JUnit test suite. It focuses on the class.
class Adder {
 public int add(int a, int b) {
 return a + b;
}
The test suite uses assert statements to verify the expected result of various input values to the method.
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;
public class AdderUnitTest {
 @Test
 public void sumReturnsZeroForZeroInput() {
 Adder adder = new Adder();
 assertEquals(0, adder.add(0, 0));

 @Test
 public void sumReturnsSumOfTwoPositiveNumbers() {
 Adder adder = new Adder();
 assertEquals(3, adder.add(1, 2));

 @Test
 public void sumReturnsSumOfTwoNegativeNumbers() {
 Adder adder = new Adder();
 assertEquals(-3, adder.add(-1, -2));

 @Test
 public void sumReturnsSumOfLargeNumbers() {
 Adder adder = new Adder();
 assertEquals(2222, adder.add(1234, 988));
}
== As executable specifications ==

Using unit-tests as a design specification has one significant advantage over other design methods: The design document (the unit-tests themselves) can itself be used to verify the implementation. The tests will never pass unless the developer implements a solution according to the design.

Unit testing lacks some of the accessibility of a diagrammatic specification such as a UML diagram, but they may be generated from the unit test using automated tools. Most modern languages have free tools (usually available as extensions to IDEs). Free tools, like those based on the xUnit framework, outsource to another system the graphical rendering of a view for human consumption.

== Applications ==

=== Extreme programming ===
Unit testing is the cornerstone of extreme programming, which relies on an automated unit testing framework. This automated unit testing framework can be either third party, e.g., xUnit, or created within the development group.

Extreme programming uses the creation of unit tests for test-driven development. The developer writes a unit test that exposes either a software requirement or a defect. This test will fail because either the requirement isn&#x27;t implemented yet, or because it intentionally exposes a defect in the existing code. Then, the developer writes the simplest code to make the test, along with other tests, pass.

Most code in a system is unit tested, but not necessarily all paths through the code. Extreme programming mandates a &quot;test everything that can possibly break&quot; strategy, over the traditional &quot;test every execution path&quot; method. This leads developers to develop fewer tests than classical methods, but this isn&#x27;t really a problem, more a restatement of fact, as classical methods have rarely ever been followed methodically enough for all execution paths to have been thoroughly tested. Extreme programming simply recognizes that testing is rarely exhaustive (because it is often too expensive and time-consuming to be economically viable) and provides guidance on how to effectively focus limited resources.

Crucially, the test code is considered a first class project artifact in that it is maintained at the same quality as the implementation code, with all duplication removed. Developers release unit testing code to the code repository in conjunction with the code it tests. Extreme programming&#x27;s thorough unit testing allows the benefits mentioned above, such as simpler and more confident code development and refactoring, simplified code integration, accurate documentation, and more modular designs. These unit tests are also constantly run as a form of regression test.

Unit testing is also critical to the concept of Emergent Design. As emergent design is heavily dependent upon refactoring, unit tests are an integral component.

=== Automated testing frameworks ===
An automated testing framework provides features for automating test execution and can accelerate writing and running tests. Frameworks have been developed for a wide variety of programming languages.

Generally, frameworks are third-party; not distributed with a compiler or integrated development environment (IDE). 

Tests can be written without using a framework to exercise the code under test using assertions, exception handling, and other control flow mechanisms to verify behavior and report failure. Some note that testing without a framework is valuable since there is a barrier to entry for the adoption of a framework; that having some tests is better than none, but once a framework is in place, adding tests can be easier.

In some frameworks advanced test features are missing and must be hand-coded.

=== Language-level unit testing support ===
Some programming languages directly support unit testing. Their grammar allows the direct declaration of unit tests without importing a library (whether third party or standard). Additionally, the Boolean conditions of the unit tests can be expressed in the same syntax as Boolean expressions used in non-unit test code, such as what is used for and statements.

<text>A model airport is a scale model of an airport.
While airport models have been around, in a way, since airfields were open to the public, early model airports were basically restricted to public showcases about the airport and its surroundings to the public; these were usually located inside the airport themselves.

Since Herpa Wings&#x27;s introduction of their &quot;airport set&quot; series to their line of airline related toys, there has been an increase of aircraft modelers who have made mock airports to showcase their private collection of model aircraft. Often, the collector will model their airport after a real-life airport.

Model airports can be made to look very realistic, with many real airport features such as terminals, control towers, cargo terminals, hangars, passenger bridges and more. Companies such as Gemini Jets, Herpa Wings, and JC Wings have produced ground support equipment in various scales.

Collectors who make model airports may use die-cast models for their creation. Among the brands of die cast aircraft models most commonly used on these airports are Aeroclassics, Herpa Wings, Dragon Models Limited, Gemini Jets, Phoenix Models, JC Wings, and NG Model.

In 2011, what may be the world&#x27;s largest model airport opened for public view at Miniatur Wunderland in Hamburg, Germany. The model, named &quot;Knuffingen International Airport,&quot; is based on Hamburg International Airport.
Another popular park in Europe, Madurodam in the Netherlands includes a model airport featuring models of several airlines such as KLM, Emirates, Lufthansa, EVA Air, Turkish Airlines, UPS Airlines, Transavia, Thai Airways, Korean Air, Delta Air Lines, and an A380 of Singapore Airlines, alongside a DHL-branded Airbus A300. The Madurodam airport is based on Amsterdam&#x27;s Schiphol Airport.

In addition, the TWA Hotel in New York features a model airport that demonstrates the way the TWA airline&#x27;s operation center used to look like at New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Airport in the 1960s and 1970s. This model airport was made using TWA model aircraft and runways and buildings in the 1:400 scale.

<doc id="222836" wikidata="Q507377" url="?curid=222836" title="Positional asphyxia">
<text>Positional asphyxia, also known as postural asphyxia, is a form of asphyxia which occurs when someone&#x27;s position prevents the person from breathing adequately. People may die from positional asphyxia accidentally, when the mouth and nose are blocked, or where the chest may be unable to fully expand.

==Background==
A 1992 article in &quot;The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology&quot; and a 2000 article in &quot;The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology&quot; said that multiple cases have been associated with the hogtie or hobble prone restraint position.

The New York Police Department&#x27;s guidelines, explaining protocols for mitigating in-custody deaths, were published in a 1995 Department of Justice bulletin on &quot;positional asphyxia.&quot; The NYPD recommended that, &quot;[a]s soon as the subject is handcuffed, get him off his stomach. Turn him on his side or place him in a seated position.&quot; A 1996 FBI bulletin said that many law enforcement and health personnel were being taught to avoid restraining people face-down or to do so only for a very short period of time.

Resuscitation of persons who exhibit cardiac arrest following restraint has proven to be difficult, according to a 1995 article in &quot;Annals of Emergency Medicine&quot;. Even in cases where the subject was in the immediate care of paramedics, resuscitation has failed and the subject has died. A March 1999 article in the &quot;Academic Emergency Medicine&quot; journal reported that one group of doctors had presented a method of resuscitation, correcting acidosis in the blood of the victim, which proved effective in their small scale study. A 2010 article in the &quot;Journal of the Tennessee Medical Association&quot; reported a single case of successful resuscitation using &quot;aggressive sedation&quot;, &quot;ventilatory assistance&quot; among other interventions but added that &quot;avoiding hobble and prone restraint positions may eliminate some of the problems&quot;.

In 1997 &quot;Annals of Emergency Medicine&quot; article reported on a single small laboratory study in which &quot;15 healthy men ages 18 through 40 years&quot; were placed in the &quot;hobble&quot; or &quot;hog-tie&quot; restraint position. Researchers found that the effects of restraint on the breathing and oxygen levels these 15 healthy men, was limited.

A 2002 review of the literature published in the &quot;British Journal of Forensic Practice&quot; said that restraining a person in a face-down position is likely to cause greater restriction of breathing than restraining a person face-up.

A 2008 article in &quot;Medicine, Science and the Law&quot; said that the way the subject is restrained can also increase the risk of death, for example kneeling or otherwise placing weight on the subject and particularly any type of restraint hold around the subject&#x27;s neck. Research measuring the effect of restraint positions on lung function suggests that restraint which involves bending the restrained person or placing body weight on them has more effect on their breathing than face-down positioning alone.

In the United States, there were 16 reported deaths in police custody between 1998 and 2009 in which restraint was a &quot;direct or contributory factor to the death.&quot; The investigation into the deaths resulted in a 2010 report tabled by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

Prolonged (particularly resisted) restraint, obesity, prior cardiac or respiratory problems, and the use of illicit drugs such as cocaine can increase the risk of death by restraint, according to a 2001 article in &quot;American Journal of Emergency Medicine&quot;.

Positional asphyxia is not limited to restraint in a face down position according to a 2011 article in &quot;Medicine, Science, and the Law&quot;. Restraining a person in a seated position may also reduce the ability to breathe, if the person is pushed forwards with the chest on or close to the knees. The risk will be higher in cases where the restrained person has a high body mass index (BMI) and/or large waist girth.

A 2012 series by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) reported that, since the late 1990s, coroners used the term &quot;excited delirium&quot; to explain restraint-related deaths involving police officers. A May 1997 article in said that deaths in real life situations occur after excited delirium, which had not been studied in laboratory simulations at that time.

==Accident or illness==

Positional asphyxia may also occur as a result of accident or illness, according to a 2008 article in the &quot;Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine&quot;. This can include bed rail strangulation.

A 2008 &quot;EMBO Reports&quot; article on sudden infant death syndrome, said that the number of diagnoses of &#x27;accidental suffocation&#x27;, &#x27;wedging&#x27; or &#x27;positional asphyxia&#x27; had increased.&quot;

Olympic track athlete Florence Griffith-Joyner and ex-Major League Baseball player John Marzano both died due to positional asphyxia, the former following an epileptic seizure and the latter following a fall down a flight of stairs.

<text>Macrobert Arts Centre is a multi-arts venue located on the main campus of the University of Stirling, Scotland. The Arts Centre offers a varied programme of events and experiences – cinema, comedy, dance, exhibitions, family, get involved, music, opera and theatre – catering for audiences from across Stirling, the Forth Valley and beyond. It was originally opened in 1971 as Scotland&#x27;s first purpose-built arts centre, the brainchild of the university&#x27;s first principal, Tom Cottrell FRSE, who wanted appreciation of the arts to be at the heart of the university&#x27;s cultural ethos.

In October 2002 the Arts Centre re-opened following a period of refurbishment by Appleton Architects and Buro Happold.

Macrobert Arts Centre is a registered charity under Scottish law. It receives key funding from Creative Scotland and the University of Stirling, while raising 70% of its required funds through ticket sales and donations, grants and sponsorship.

<text>A welfare state is a form of government in which the state (or a well-established network of social institutions) protects and promotes the economic and social well-being of its citizens, based upon the principles of equal opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for citizens unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life.

There is substantial variability in the form and trajectory of the welfare state across countries and regions. All welfare states entail some degree of private–public partnerships wherein the administration and delivery of at least some welfare programs occur through private entities. Welfare state services are also provided at varying territorial levels of government.

Early features of the welfare state, such as public pensions and social insurance, developed from the 1880s onwards in industrializing Western countries. World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II have been characterized as important events that ushered in the expansion of the welfare state. The fullest forms of the welfare state were developed after World War II.

== Etymology ==
The term welfare is much older than the term welfare state. In enlightened absolutism, the ruler had an unlimited position of power, which he was to only utilize to the extent necessary for the &quot;welfare&quot; of his subjects. The content of the &quot;welfare&quot; or &quot;good police&quot;, which limited the ruler&#x27;s legitimate exercise of power, was defined by the authorities at their own discretion. This is also referred to as &quot;welfare absolutism&quot;. The term welfare state is used in connection with princely absolutism, this is usually in conjunction with attributes such as absolutist, mercantilist or pre-modern.

The German term (&quot;social state&quot;) has been used since 1870 to describe state support programs devised by German (&quot;social politicians&quot;) and implemented as part of Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s conservative reforms.

Today the term is used almost entirely for the &quot;modern&quot; welfare state, which emerged in the 19th century in the course of the socio-economic upheavals caused by industrialisation, the formation of nation states and democratization. While the corresponding English term welfare state is descriptively neutral, the term &quot;&quot; is often used in German as a fighting term with a pejorative connotation.

The literal English equivalent &quot;social state&quot; did not catch on in Anglophone countries. However, during the Second World War, Anglican Archbishop William Temple, author of the book Christianity and the Social Order (1942), popularized the concept using the phrase &quot;welfare state&quot;. Bishop Temple&#x27;s use of &quot;welfare state&quot; has been connected to Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s 1845 novel &quot;Sybil: or the Two Nations&quot; (in other words, the rich and the poor), where he writes &quot;power has only one duty – to secure the social welfare of the PEOPLE&quot;. At the time he wrote &quot;Sybil&quot;, Disraeli (later a prime minister) belonged to Young England, a conservative group of youthful Tories who disagreed with how the Whigs dealt with the conditions of the industrial poor. Members of Young England attempted to garner support among the privileged classes to assist the less fortunate and to recognize the dignity of labor that they imagined had characterized England during the Feudal Middle Ages.

== History ==
=== Ancient ===

==== India ====
Emperor Ashoka of India put forward his idea of a welfare state in the 3rd century BCE. He envisioned his &quot;dharma&quot; (religion or path) as not just a collection of high-sounding phrases. He consciously tried to adopt it as a matter of state policy; he declared that &quot;all men are my children&quot; and &quot;whatever exertion I make, I strive only to discharge debt that I owe to all living creatures.&quot; It was a completely new ideal of kingship. Ashoka renounced war and conquest by violence and forbade the killing of many animals. Since he wanted to conquer the world through love and faith, he sent many missions to propagate Dharma. Such missions were sent to places like Egypt, Greece, and Sri Lanka. The propagation of Dharma included many measures of people&#x27;s welfare. Centers of the treatment of men and beasts founded inside and outside of the empire. Shady groves, wells, orchards and rest houses were laid out. Ashoka also prohibited useless sacrifices and certain forms of gatherings which led to waste, indiscipline and superstition. To implement these policies he recruited a new cadre of officers called Dharmamahamattas. Part of this group&#x27;s duties was to see that people of various sects were treated fairly. They were especially asked to look after the welfare of prisoners.

However, the historical record of Ashoka&#x27;s character is conflicted. Ashoka&#x27;s own inscriptions state that he converted to Buddhism after waging a destructive war. However, the Sri Lankan tradition claims that he had already converted to Buddhism in the 4th year of his reign, although it does not mention the conquest of Kalinga. During this war, according to Ashoka&#x27;s Major Rock Edict 13, with nearly 100,000 killed in the war and another 150,000 deported. Some sources (particularly Buddhist oral legends) suggest that his conversion was dramatic and that he dedicated the rest of his life to the pursuit of peace and the common good. However, these sources frequently contradict each other, and a few sources (like &quot;Ashokavadana&quot;, earliest versions ranging from 200 AD to 500 AD) describe Ashoka engaging in sectarian mass murder throughout his reign, and make no mention of the philanthropic efforts claimed by earlier legends. The interpretation of Ashoka&#x27;s dharma after conversion is controversial, but in particular, the texts which describe him personally ordering the massacre of Buddhist heretics and Jains have been disputed by many scholars, since these are directly contradictory to his own edicts, and are legendary in nature.

==== China ====
The Emperor Wen (203 – 157 BCE) of Han Dynasty instituted a variety of measures with resemblances to modern welfare policies. These included pensions, in the form of food and wine, to all over 80 years of age, as well as monetary support, in the form of loans or tax breaks, to widows, orphans, and elderly without children to support them. Emperor Wen was also known for a concern over wasteful spending of tax-payer money. Unlike other Han emperors, he wore simple silk garments. In order to make the state serve the common people better, cruel criminal punishments were lessened and the state bureaucracy was made more meritocratic. This led to officials being selected by examinations for the first time in Chinese history.

==== Rome ====
The Roman Republic intervened sporadically to distribute free or subsidized grain to its population, through the program known as &quot;Cura Annonae.&quot; The city of Rome grew rapidly during the Roman Republic and Empire, reaching a population approaching one million in the second century AD. The population of the city grew beyond the capacity of the nearby rural areas to meet the food needs of the city.

Regular grain distribution began in 123 BC with a grain law proposed by Gaius Gracchus and approved by the Roman Plebeian Council (popular assembly). The numbers of those receiving free or subsidized grain expanded to a high of an estimated 320,000 people at one point. In the 3rd century AD, the dole of grain was replaced by bread, probably during the reign of Septimius Severus (193–211 AD). Severus also began providing olive oil to residents of Rome, and later the emperor Aurelian (270–275) ordered the distribution of wine and pork. The doles of bread, olive oil, wine, and pork apparently continued until near the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. The dole in the early Roman Empire is estimated to account for 15 to 33 percent of the total grain imported and consumed in Rome.

In addition to food, the Roman Republic also supplied free entertainment, through &quot;ludi&quot; (public games). Public money was allocated for the staging of &quot;ludi,&quot; but the presiding official increasingly came to augment the splendor of his games from personal funds as a form of public relations. The sponsor was able to cultivate the favor of the people of Rome.

===Islamic caliphates===
The concept of states taxing for the welfare budget was introduced to the Arabs in the early 7th century by caliph Omar, most likely adapted from the newly Roman territories. &quot;Zakat&quot; is also one of the five pillars of Islam and is a mandatory form of 2.5% Wealth tax to be paid by all individuals holding above a basic threshold (nisab) to provide for the needy once a year after Ramadan. Umar (584–644), leader of the Rashidun Caliphate (empire), established a welfare state through the Bayt al-mal (treasury), which for instance was used to stockpile food in every region of the Islamic Empire reserved for Arabs in the Peninsula.

=== Modern ===
Otto von Bismarck established the first welfare state in a modern industrial society, with social-welfare legislation, in 1880s Imperial Germany. Bismarck extended the privileges of the Junker social class to ordinary Germans. His 17 November 1881 Imperial Message to the Reichstag used the term &quot;practical Christianity&quot; to describe his program. German laws from this era also insured workers against industrial risks inherent in the workplace.

In Switzerland, the Swiss Factory Act of 1877 limited working hours for everyone, and gave maternity benefits. The Swiss welfare state also arose in the late 19th century; its existence and depth varied individually by canton. Some of the programs first adopted were emergency relief, elementary schools, and homes for the elderly and children.

In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a version was set up by Count Eduard von Taaffe a few years after Bismarck in Germany. Legislation to help the working class in Austria emerged from Catholic conservatives. Von Taffe used Swiss and German models of social reform, including the Swiss Factory Act of 1877 German laws that insured workers against industrial risks inherent in the workplace to create the 1885 Trade Code Amendment.

Changed attitudes in reaction to the worldwide Great Depression of the 1930s, which brought unemployment and misery to millions, were instrumental in the move to the welfare state in many countries. During the Great Depression, the welfare state was seen as a &quot;middle way&quot; between the extremes of communism on the left and unregulated &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism on the right. In the period following World War II, some countries in Western Europe moved from partial or selective provision of social services to relatively comprehensive &quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; coverage of the population. Other Western European states did not, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and France. Political scientist Eileen McDonagh has argued that a major determinant of where welfare states arose is whether or not a country had a historical monarchy with familial foundations (a trait that Max Weber called patrimonialism); in places where the monarchic state was viewed as a parental steward of the populace, it was easier to shift into a mindset where the industrial state could also serve as a parental steward of the populace.

The activities of present-day welfare states extend to the provision of both cash welfare benefits (such as old-age pensions or unemployment benefits) and in-kind welfare services (such as health or childcare services). Through these provisions, welfare states can affect the distribution of wellbeing and personal autonomy among their citizens, as well as influencing how their citizens consume and how they spend their time.

=== Analysis ===
Historian of the 20th-century fascist movement, Robert Paxton, observes that the provisions of the welfare state were enacted in the 19th century by religious conservatives to counteract appeals from trade unions and socialism. Later, Paxton writes &quot;All the modern twentieth-century European dictatorships of the right, both fascist and authoritarian, were welfare states… They all provided medical care, pensions, affordable housing, and mass transport as a matter of course, in order to maintain productivity, national unity, and social peace.&quot; In Germany, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party maintained the welfare state established by previous German governments, but restructured it so as to help only Aryan individuals considered worthy of assistance, excluding &quot;alcoholics, tramps, homosexuals, prostitutes, the &#x27;work-shy&#x27; or the &#x27;asocial&#x27;, habitual criminals, the hereditarily ill (a widely defined category) and members of races other than the Aryan.&quot; Nevertheless, even with these limitations, over 17 million German citizens were receiving assistance under the auspices of the National Socialist People&#x27;s Welfare by 1939.

When social democratic parties abandoned Marxism after World War II, they increasingly accepted the welfare state as a political goal, either as a temporary goal within capitalism or an ultimate goal in itself.

A theoretical addition from 2005 is that of Kahl in their article &#x27;The religious roots of modern policy: Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed Protestant traditions compared&#x27;. They argue that the welfare state policies of several European countries can be traced back to their religious origins. This process has its origin in the &#x27;poor relief&#x27; systems, and social norms present in Christian nations. The example countries are categorized as follows: Catholic – Spain, Italy and France; Lutheran – Denmark, Sweden and Germany; Reformed Protestant – Netherlands, the UK and the USA. The Catholic countries had a late adoption of welfare benefits and social assistance, the latter being splintered and meagre, due to several religious and social factors. Giving alms was an important part of catholic society as the wealthy could resolve their sins through participation in the act. As such, begging was allowed and was subject to a greater degree of acceptance. Poverty was seen as being close to grace and there was no onus for change placed onto the poor. These factors, coupled with the power of the church meant that state provided benefits did not arise until late in the 20th century. Additionally, social assistance was not done at a comprehensive level, each group in need had their assistance added incrementally. This accounts for the fragmented nature of social assistance in these countries.

Lutheran states were early to provide welfare and late to provide social assistance but this was done uniformly. Poverty was seen as more of an individual affliction of laziness and immorality. Work was viewed as a calling. As such these societies banned begging and created workhouses to force the able-bodied to work. These uniform state actions paved the way for comprehensive welfare benefits, as those who worked deserved assistance when in need. When social assistance was delivered for those who had never worked, it was in the context of the uniform welfare provision. The concept of Predestination is key for understanding welfare assistance in Reformed Protestant states. Poor people were seen as being punished, therefore begging and state assistance was non existent. As such churches and charities filled the void resulting in early social assistance and late welfare benefits. The USA still has minimal welfare benefits today, because of their religious roots, according to Kahl.

Also from 2005, Jacob Hacker stated that there was &quot;broad agreement&quot; in research on welfare that there had not been welfare state retrenchment. Instead, &quot;social policy frameworks remain secure.&quot;

== Forms ==

Broadly speaking, welfare states are either universal, with provisions that cover everybody; or selective, with provisions covering only those deemed most needy. In his 1990 book, &quot;The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism&quot;, Danish sociologist Gøsta Esping-Andersen further identified three subtypes of welfare state models; liberal, social-democratic, and conservative.

Esping-Anderson development of the three subtypes of welfare regimes were categorized under three dimensions: 1) state and market relations or the relationship between the state and market, 2) stratification or social relations and relationships, 3) social citizenship rights or whether or not an individual is dependent on the labor market.

Since the building of the decommodification index is limited and the typology is debatable, these 18 countries could be ranked from most purely social-democratic (Sweden) to the most liberal (the United States). Ireland represents a near-hybrid model whereby two streams of unemployment benefit exist: contributory and means-tested. However, payments can begin immediately and are theoretically available to all Irish citizens even if they have never worked, provided they are habitually resident.

Social stigma varies across the three conceptual welfare states. Particularly, it is highest in liberal states, and lowest in social democratic states. Esping-Andersen proposes that the universalist nature of social democratic states eliminate the duality between beneficiaries and non-recipients, whereas in means-tested liberal states there is resentment towards redistribution efforts. That is to say, the lower the percent of GDP spent on welfare, the higher the stigma of the welfare state. Esping-Andersen also argues that welfare states set the stage for post-industrial employment evolution in terms of employment growth, structure, and stratification. He uses Germany, Sweden, and the United States to provide examples of the differing results of each of the three welfare states.

According to Evelyne Huber and John Stephens, different types of welfare states emerged as a result of prolonged government by different parties. They distinguish between social democratic welfare states, Christian democratic welfare states, and &quot;wage earner&quot; states.

According to the Swedish political scientist Bo Rothstein, in non-universal welfare states, the state is primarily concerned with directing resources to &quot;the people most in need&quot;. This requires tight bureaucratic control in order to determine who is eligible for assistance and who is not. Under universal models such as Sweden, on the other hand, the state distributes welfare to all people who fulfill easily established criteria (e.g. having children, receiving medical treatment, etc.) with as little bureaucratic interference as possible. This, however, requires higher taxation due to the scale of services provided. This model was constructed by the Scandinavian ministers Karl Kristian Steincke and Gustav Möller in the 1930s and is dominant in Scandinavia.

Sociologist Lane Kenworthy argues that the Nordic experience demonstrates that the modern social democratic model can &quot;promote economic security, expand opportunity, and ensure rising living standards for all ... while facilitating freedom, flexibility and market dynamism.&quot;

American political scientist Benjamin Radcliff has also argued that the universality and generosity of the welfare state (i.e. the extent of decommodification) is the single most important societal-level structural factor affecting the quality of human life, based on the analysis of time serial data across both the industrial democracies and the American States. He maintains that the welfare state improves life for everyone, regardless of social class (as do similar institutions, such as pro-worker labor market regulations and strong labor unions).

=== Gender and welfare ===
Esping-Andersen&#x27;s welfare typology is often criticized by feminists for being gender blind. According to Keerty Nakray, Esping-Andersen&#x27;s three types of dimensions (state and market relations, stratification, and social citizenship rights) does not acknowledge unpaid care-work done by women within the household economy. This failure of recognizing unpaid work is due to the fact that welfare states are focused on the male-breadwinner concept. Because Esping-Andersen argued that the welfare state set the stage for employment evolution, the lack of gender analysis creates an unintended emphasis on male employment.

Sociologist Ann Shola Orloff reframes the three dimensions with a gendered lens. As she reframes, Orloff incorporates gender and expands the decommodification index within three dimensions: 1) focus on families and the welfare states in state and market relations, 2) including the relationship between gender and labor in stratifications on social provisions, 3) how men and women are dependent on the labor market and the effect of welfare on decommodification for both genders. Reframing the decommodification index with a gendered lens ensures women doing care-work don&#x27;t get left behind within the welfare state.

=== UBI as a replacement for the welfare state ===
Universal basic income (UBI) has been proposed as a replacement for the traditional welfare state where social protection schemes are also social policies with a precise aim that can be regarded as social engineering. The focus of the UBI is granting individuals more freedom in determining life choices by providing a lifetime of financial security regardless of one&#x27;s career preferences or lifepath.

According to statements of American Enterprise Institute-affiliated Libertarian/conservative scholar Charles Murray, recalled and sanctioned by the George Gibbs Chair in Political Economy and Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and nationally syndicated columnist Veronique de Rugy, as of 2014, the annual cost of a UBI in the US would have been about $200 billion cheaper than the US system put in place at that date. By 2020, it would have been nearly a trillion dollars cheaper.

== By country or region ==
=== Australia ===

Prior to 1900 in Australia, charitable assistance from benevolent societies, sometimes with financial contributions from the authorities, was the primary means of relief for people not able to support themselves. The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the Labor parties during this period led to a movement for welfare reform.

In 1900, New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over. Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the Deakin government introduced a national aged pension under the &quot;Invalid and Old-Aged Pensions Act 1908&quot;. A national invalid disability pension was started in 1910, and a national maternity allowance was introduced by the Fisher government in 1912.

In the 1920s and 1930s, detailed proposals were developed for a comprehensive national insurance scheme covering medical, disability, unemployment and pension benefits. Multiple royal commissions were held on the subject and the scheme was legislated as the &quot;National Health and Pensions Insurance Act 1938&quot;. However, the scheme was ultimately abandoned for cost reasons in the lead-up to the Second World War.

During the Second World War, the federal government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for: child endowment in 1941; a widows&#x27; pension in 1942; a wife&#x27;s allowance in 1943; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943; and unemployment, sickness, and special benefits in 1945.

Medicare is Australia&#x27;s publicly funded universal health care insurance scheme. Initially created in 1975 by the Whitlam Labor government under the name &quot;Medibank&quot;. The Fraser Liberal government made significant changes to it from 1976 leading to its abolition in late 1981. The Hawke government reinstated universal health care in 1984 under the name &quot;Medicare&quot;.

=== Canada ===
Canada&#x27;s welfare programs are funded and administered at all levels of government (with 13 different provincial/territorial systems), and include health and medical care, public education (through graduate school), social housing and social services. Social support is given through programs including Social Assistance, Guaranteed Income Supplement, Child Tax Benefit, Old Age Security, Employment Insurance, Workers&#x27; Compensation, and the Canada/Quebec Pension Plans.

=== France ===

After 1830, French liberalism and economic modernization were key goals. While liberalism was individualistic and laissez-faire in the United Kingdom and the United States, in France liberalism was based instead on a solidaristic conception of society, following the theme of the French Revolution, &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot; (&quot;liberty, equality, fraternity&quot;). In the Third Republic, especially between 1895 and 1914 &quot;Solidarité&quot; [&quot;solidarism&quot;] was the guiding concept of a liberal social policy, whose chief champions were the prime ministers Leon Bourgeois (1895–96) and Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau (1899–1902). The French welfare state expanded when it tried to follow some of Bismarck&#x27;s policies. Poor relief was the starting point. More attention was paid to industrial labour in the 1930s during a short period of socialist political ascendency, with the Matignon Accords and the reforms of the Popular Front. Paxton points out these reforms were paralleled and even exceeded by measures taken by the Vichy regime in the 1940s.

=== Germany ===

Some policies enacted to enhance social welfare in Germany were Health Insurance 1883, Accident Insurance 1884, Old Age Pensions 1889 and National Unemployment Insurance 1927. Otto von Bismarck, the powerful Chancellor of Germany (in office 1871–90), developed the first modern welfare state by building on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that had begun as early as in the 1840s. The measures that Bismarck introduced – old-age pensions, accident insurance, and employee health insurance – formed the basis of the modern European welfare state. His paternalistic programs aimed to forestall social unrest and to undercut the appeal of the new Social Democratic Party, and to secure the support of the working classes for the German Empire, as well as to reduce emigration to the United States, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist. Bismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers through his high-tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.

During the 12 years of rule by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party, the welfare state established by previous German governments was maintained, but it was restructured so as to help only Aryan individuals considered worthy of assistance, excluding &quot;alcoholics, tramps, homosexuals, prostitutes, the &#x27;work-shy&#x27; or the &#x27;asocial&#x27;, habitual criminals, the hereditarily ill (a widely defined category) and members of races other than the Aryan.&quot; Nevertheless, even with these limitations, over 17 million German citizens received assistance under the auspices of the Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt (NSV) by 1939. The agency projected a powerful image of caring and support for those who were seen as full members of the German racial community, but it also inspired fear through its intrusive questioning and the threat of opening investigations on those who did not fulfill the criteria for support.

=== India ===

The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution reflects that India is a welfare state. Food security to all Indians is guaranteed under the National Food Security Act, 2013 where the government provides food grains to people at a very subsidised rate.

Since 2001, India has developed a strong welfare state with continuous increase in government expenditure on the social sector over the years. The general government&#x27;s expenditure on social security and welfare which includes health insurances and public hospitals, education, grants for housing, financial transfers to the poor, free bus or metro tickets, unemployment benefits and a variety of social pensions was approximately in 2022, representing 8.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).

=== Latin America ===
Welfare states in Latin America have been considered as &quot;welfare states in transition&quot;, or &quot;emerging welfare states&quot;. Welfare states in Latin America have been described as &quot;truncated&quot;: generous benefits for formal-sector workers, regressive subsidies and informal barriers for the poor to obtain benefits. Mesa-Lago has classified the countries taking into account the historical experience of their welfare systems. The pioneers were Uruguay, Chile and Argentina, as they started to develop the first welfare programs in the 1920s following a bismarckian model. Other countries such as Costa Rica developed a more universal welfare system (1960s–1970s) with social security programs based on the Beveridge model. Researchers such as Martinez-Franzoni and Barba-Solano have examined and identified several welfare regime models based on the typology of Esping-Andersen. Other scholars such as Riesco and Cruz-Martinez have examined the welfare state development in the region.

About welfare states in Latin America, Alex Segura-Ubiergo wrote:
=== Middle East ===

Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are examples of welfare states in the Middle East.

=== Nordic countries ===

The Nordic welfare model refers to the welfare policies of the Nordic countries, which also tie into their labor market policies. The Nordic model of welfare is distinguished from other types of welfare states by its emphasis on maximizing labor force participation, promoting gender equality, egalitarian and extensive benefit levels, the large magnitude of income redistribution and liberal use of the expansionary fiscal policy.

While there are differences among the Nordic countries, they all share a broad commitment to social cohesion, a universal nature of welfare provision in order to safeguard individualism by providing protection for vulnerable individuals and groups in society and maximizing public participation in social decision-making. It is characterized by flexibility and openness to innovation in the provision of welfare. The Nordic welfare systems are mainly funded through taxation.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

China traditionally relied on the extended family to provide welfare services. The one-child policy introduced in 1978 has made that unrealistic, and new models have emerged since the 1980s as China has rapidly become richer and more urban. Much discussion is underway regarding China&#x27;s proposed path toward a welfare state. Chinese policies have been incremental and fragmented in terms of social insurance, privatization, and targeting. In the cities, where the rapid economic development has centered, lines of cleavage have developed between state-sector and non-state-sector employees, and between labor-market insiders and outsiders.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In 1995, the government started the Samurdhi (Prosperity) program aimed at reducing poverty, having replaced the Jana Saviya poverty alleviation programme that was in place at the time.

=== Singapore ===
In Singapore, the government provides financial and social support through a variety of social assistance schemes for lower and middle-income Singaporeans. The Ministry of Social and Family Development runs ComCare, a program which provides income support for low-income citizen households through various schemes for short-to-medium term assistance, long-term assistance, child support, and urgent financial needs. The Community Development Councils also run various local assistance schemes within their districts. The Ministry of Manpower runs a Silver Support Scheme which provides additional financial support for low-income elderly with no family support. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health also runs MediFund to assist anyone on their behalf to pay off the rest of their medical bills after initial government subsidies, other health financing schemes as well as funds from the Central Provident Fund has been used.

In 2012, the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) was introduced. It is a medical card that provides extended subsidies exclusively for Singaporean citizens usually from lower-to-middle income households, as well as the older generations, where they could receive treatment for common illnesses, chronic health problems and specific dental issues at private clinics for free. The intentions behind the scheme were to encourage Singaporeans to use such a card and tap into the private healthcare sector for common or minor chronic illnesses, as well as dental care, to reduce the strain at public community hospitals. Originally, only a blue and orange card existed, depending on their household income. The CHAS scheme was further expanded in 2019 to include a new green card that provides for all Singaporeans no matter their household income. As a result, all Singaporeans became covered for chronic and common illnesses as well as dentistry at privately owned clinics. Subsidies for complex chronic conditions was also increased.

In addition, the National Council of Social Service coordinates a range of 450 non-government voluntary welfare organisations to provide social services, while raising funds through The Community Chest of Singapore. Taking the World Bank&#x27;s International Poverty Line (IPL)&#x27;s poverty threshold into account, the population of Singaporeans living below the poverty line is virtually non-existent. Singapore also has one of the highest housing ownership rates in the world – over 90 percent – owing to the government&#x27;s policy of constructing extensive and quality public housing throughout the country and providing extensive subsidies for its citizens to obtain them.

=== United Kingdom ===

About the British welfare state, historian Derek Fraser wrote:
The modern welfare state in the United Kingdom began operations with the Liberal welfare reforms of 1906–1914 under Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. These included the passing of the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, the introduction of free school meals in 1909, the Labour Exchanges Act 1909, the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909, which heralded greater government intervention in economic development, and the National Insurance Act 1911 setting up a national insurance contribution for unemployment and health benefits from work.

The People&#x27;s Budget was introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, in 1909 to fund the welfare reforms. After much opposition, it was passed by the House of Lords on 29 April 1910.

The minimum wage was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1909 for certain low-wage industries and expanded to numerous industries, including farm labour, by 1920. However, by the 1920s, a new perspective was offered by reformers to emphasize the usefulness of family allowance targeted at low-income families as the alternative to relieving poverty without distorting the labour market. The trade unions and the Labour Party adopted this view. In 1945, family allowances were introduced; minimum wages faded from view. Talk resumed in the 1970s, but in the 1980s the Thatcher administration made it clear it would not accept a national minimum wage. Finally, with the return of Labour, the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 set a minimum of £3.60 per hour, with lower rates for younger workers. It largely affected workers in high-turnover service industries such as fast-food restaurants, and members of ethnic minorities.

December 1942 saw the publication of the &quot;Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Social Insurance and Allied Services&quot;, commonly known as the Beveridge Report after its chairman, Sir William Beveridge. The Beveridge Report proposed a series of measures to aid those who were in need of help, or in poverty and recommended that the government find ways of tackling what the report called &quot;the five giants&quot;: Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness. It urged the government to take steps to provide citizens with adequate income, adequate health care, adequate education, adequate housing, and adequate employment, proposing that &quot;all people of working age should pay a weekly National Insurance contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired, or widowed.&quot; The Beveridge Report assumed that the National Health Service would provide free health care to all citizens and that a Universal Child Benefit would give benefits to parents, encouraging people to have children by enabling them to feed and support a family.

The Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, and then the Labour Party all adopted the Beveridge Report&#x27;s recommendations. Following the Labour election victory in the 1945 general election many of Beveridge&#x27;s reforms were implemented through a series of Acts of Parliament. On 5 July 1948, the National Insurance Act, National Assistance Act and National Health Service Act came into force, forming the key planks of the modern UK welfare state. In 1949, the Legal Aid and Advice Act was passed, providing the &quot;fourth pillar&quot; of the modern welfare state, access to advice for legal redress for all.

Before 1939, most health care had to be paid for through non-government organisations – through a vast network of friendly societies, trade unions, and other insurance companies, which counted the vast majority of the UK working population as members. These organizations provided insurance for sickness, unemployment, and disability, providing an income to people when they were unable to work. As part of the reforms, the Church of England also closed down its voluntary relief networks and passed the ownership of thousands of church schools, hospitals and other bodies to the state.

Welfare systems continued to develop over the following decades. By the end of the 20th century parts of the welfare system had been restructured, with some provision channelled through non-governmental organizations which became important providers of social services.

=== United States ===

The United States developed a limited welfare state in the 1930s. The earliest and most comprehensive philosophical justification for the welfare state was produced by an American, the sociologist Lester Frank Ward (1841–1913), whom the historian Henry Steele Commager called &quot;the father of the modern welfare state&quot;.

Ward saw social phenomena as amenable to human control. &quot;It is only through the artificial control of natural phenomena that science is made to minister to human needs&quot; he wrote, &quot;and if social laws are really analogous to physical laws, there is no reason why social science should not receive practical application such as have been given to physical science.&quot; Ward wrote:
Ward&#x27;s theories centred around his belief that a universal and comprehensive system of education was necessary if a democratic government was to function successfully. His writings profoundly influenced younger generations of progressive thinkers such as Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Dewey, and Frances Perkins (1880–1965), among others.

The United States was the only industrialized country that went into the Great Depression of the 1930s with no social insurance policies in place. In 1935 Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal instituted significant social insurance policies. In 1938 Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act, limiting the work week to 40 hours and banning child labor for children under 16, over stiff congressional opposition from the low-wage South.

The Social Security law was very unpopular among many groups – especially farmers, who resented the additional taxes and feared they would never be made good. They lobbied hard for exclusion. Furthermore, the Treasury realized how difficult it would be to set up payroll deduction plans for farmers, for housekeepers who employed maids, and for non-profit groups; therefore, they were excluded. State employees were excluded for constitutional reasons (the federal government in the United States cannot tax state governments). Federal employees were also excluded.

By 2013, the U.S. remained the only major industrial state without a uniform national sickness program. American spending on health care (as a percent of GDP) is the highest in the world, but it is a complex mix of federal, state, philanthropic, employer and individual funding. The US spent 16% of its GDP on health care in 2008, compared to 11% in France in second place.

Some scholars, such as Gerard Friedman, argue that labor-union weakness in the Southern United States undermined unionization and social reform throughout the United States as a whole, and is largely responsible for the anemic U.S. welfare state. Sociologists Loïc Wacquant and John L. Campbell contend that since the rise of neoliberal ideology in the late 1970s and early 1980s, an expanding carceral state, or government system of mass incarceration, has largely supplanted the increasingly retrenched social welfare state, which has been justified by its proponents with the argument that the citizenry must take on personal responsibility. Scholars assert that this transformation of the welfare state to a post-welfare punitive state, along with neoliberal structural adjustment policies and the globalization of the U.S. economy, have created more extreme forms of &quot;destitute poverty&quot; in the U.S. which must be contained and controlled by expanding the criminal justice system into every aspect of the lives of the poor.

Other scholars such as Esping-Andersen argue that the welfare state in the United States has been characterized by private provision because such a state would better reflect the racial and sexual biases within the private sector. The disproportionate number of racial and sexual minorities in private sector jobs with weaker benefits, he argues, is evidence that the American welfare state is not necessarily intended to improve the economic situation of such groups.

==Effects==
=== Effects of welfare on poverty ===

Empirical evidence suggests that taxes and transfers considerably reduce poverty in most Western countries whose welfare states constitute at least a fifth of GDP.
=== Effects of social expenditure on economic growth, public debt and education ===

Researchers have found very little correlation between economic performance and social expenditure. They also see little evidence that social expenditures contribute to losses in productivity; economist Peter Lindert of the University of California, Davis attributes this to policy innovations such as the implementation of &quot;pro-growth&quot; tax policies in real-world welfare states. Social expenses have also not contributed significantly to public debt. Martin Eiermann wrote:
A Norwegian study covering the period 1980 to 2003 found welfare state spending correlated negatively with student achievement. However, many of the top-ranking OECD countries on the 2009 PISA tests are considered welfare states.

== Criticism and response ==

Early conservatives, under the influence of Thomas Malthus (1766–1834), opposed every form of social insurance &quot;root and branch&quot;. Malthus believed that the poor needed to learn the hard way to practice frugality, self-control and chastity. Traditional conservatives also protested that the effect of social insurance would be to weaken private charity and loosen traditional social bonds of family, friends, religious and non-governmental welfare organisations.

On the other hand, Karl Marx opposed piecemeal reforms advanced by middle-class reformers out of a sense of duty. In his &quot;Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League&quot;, written after the failed revolution of 1848, he warned that measures designed to increase wages, improve working conditions and provide social insurance were merely bribes that would temporarily make the situation of working classes tolerable to weaken the revolutionary consciousness that was needed to achieve a socialist economy. Nevertheless, Marx also proclaimed that the Communists had to support the bourgeoisie wherever it acted as a revolutionary progressive class because &quot;bourgeois liberties had first to be conquered and then criticised&quot;.

In the 20th century, opponents of the welfare state have expressed apprehension about the creation of a large, possibly self-interested, bureaucracy required to administer it and the tax burden on the wealthier citizens that this entailed.

Conservative and libertarian groups such as The Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute argue that welfare creates dependence, a disincentive to work and reduces the opportunity of individuals to manage their own lives. This dependence is called a &quot;culture of poverty&quot;, which is said to undermine people from finding meaningful work. Many of these groups also point to the large budget used to maintain these programs and assert that it is wasteful.

In the book &quot;Losing Ground&quot;, Charles Murray argues that welfare not only increases poverty, but also increases other problems such as single-parent households, and crime.

In 2012, political historian Alan Ryan pointed out that the modern welfare state stops short of being an &quot;advance in the direction of socialism. [...] [I]ts egalitarian elements are more minimal than either its defenders or its critics think&quot;. It does not entail advocacy for social ownership of industry. Ryan further wrote:
In 2017, historian Walter Scheidel argued that the establishment of welfare states in the West in the early 20th century could be partly a reaction by elites to the Bolshevik Revolution and its violence against the bourgeoisie, which feared violent revolution in its own backyard. They were diminished decades later as the perceived threat receded. Scheidel spoke to &quot;Vice&quot;&#x27;s Matt Taylor in an interview:
=== The welfare queen ===
Some argue that the public opinion on welfare in the US is in part a product of racist and classist political and ideological campaigns. The popular myth of the welfare queen, a person taking advantage of the welfare system, came to be as a result of one such effort. In 1980, Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign relied on anti-poor tactics and the anti-black strategy of putting down the black vote in order to win the favor of the white populace. Thus, racist stereotypes and polarizing dog-whistles of this era gave birth to this fictitious character.

The first version of the welfare queen was a lazy and selfish woman, living off of state benefits and having many children to obtain as much financial support as possible. In another case, it was a man buying T-bone steaks with food stamps, while the rest of the country struggled to put food on the table. While never stated directly, it was presumed by the public that both characters were, of course, black people, who were lazily exploiting the system and lived lavishly, while the regular hard-working middle-class American, imagined by the public to be white, had to foot the bill.

In &quot;The Welfare Queen: Race, Gender, Class, and Public Opinion&quot;, Carly Hayden Foster analyzes Martin Gilens&#x27; writing in &quot;Why Americans Hate Welfare&quot; and argues that race interacts with gender and class. These aspects together are then key determinants in whether or not there is public support for welfare. According to her analysis, survey respondents are more likely to support welfare spending if the mother reliant on welfare is described as white, while a black welfare mother fares significantly less support. It is argued that this is in part because of the idea that the black mother would then have an incentive to have more black babies, but is in general interrelated with the perceived reproductive behavior of the mother, which in this case is affected by the enduring Jezebel stereotype that presents black women as inherently sexually promiscuous. Similarly, public support of welfare is unlikely in the case of poor single mothers.

The widespread assumption that welfare recipients are fraudulent and lazy apparently guides public opinion. In &quot;The Crime of Survival&quot; Jullily Kohler-Hausmann defends the position that anti-fraud campaigns as it relates to welfare worsen public perception of welfare recipients and frame them as criminals. He goes on to cite Martin Gilens who in &quot;Why Americans Hate Welfare&quot; argues:
This sentiment was perpetrated by the Reagan administration and he himself addressed the supposed fraud in public programs in his first inaugural address. During his presidency, welfare spending tighetened and the anti-fraud rhetoric was used to justify big cuts to welfare programs. Regarding this period, Martin Gilens cites Julius Wilson, who writes:
Martin Gilens argues that economic circumstance is a deciding factor in the public opinion on welfare. He says that during the period of growing economy, people are willing to share their profits with the less fortunate, but this generosity disappears in times of economic turmoil, as people are primarily preoccupied with their own well-being and are less willing to provide for the poor because their own situation takes precedence.

He cites Michael Katz, who claims that the stagflation following the 1973 energy crisis caused the public opinion to shift toward a negative attitude toward the expansion of the social welfare state, as people who worried for their financial future were in search of a scape-goat for their economic losses, in this case welfare recipients.

<text>Zion Silvan Shalom (, born 4 August 1958) is an Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Likud between 1992 and 2015. He held several prominent ministerial positions, including Vice Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. He resigned on 24 December 2015 following allegations of sexual harassment. Later on, the Attorney-General closed this investigation and said these claims were unsubstantiated.

==Early life==
Shalom was born in Gabès, Tunisia on 4 August 1958 to a family that traced its roots to the Sephardic Beit Shalom dynasty. His family moved to Israel in 1959, settling in the city of Beersheba in the Negev. On 3 November 1964, when Shalom was six years old, his father Shimon Shalom, a bank manager and a member of the Betar movement, was killed during the course of a bungled bank robbery. The murder was notoriously known as the first committed in a bank robbery in the history of the young State of Israel. At the age of 18, Shalom was inducted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and rose to the rank of sergeant.

==Education and early career==
After completing his service in the IDF, Shalom attended Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba, from which he received a BA in economics and earned his certification as a Certified Public Accountant. During that time, Shalom was elected as the chairman of the university&#x27;s students&#x27; union and later as the vice chairman of the national students union. He then studied law and public policy at Tel Aviv University. He received an LLB and was certified as a lawyer, and a received a Master&#x27;s degree in public policy.

Shalom began his career as a journalist. While working on his bachelor&#x27;s degree, he wrote for &quot;Yedioth Aharonoth,&quot; a daily newspaper, in its students section. Afterwards he started working at the &quot;Rosh Berosh&quot; magazine and in the Negev&#x27;s local newspaper. In 1980, he moved to Tel Aviv and started working at the now-defunct daily &quot;Hadashot&quot;. In 1984, he was appointed as its head political and economic correspondent.

==Political career==
In 1985, Shalom was appointed adviser to the Finance Minister, Yitzhak Moda&#x27;i, who was later appointed Justice Minister. At the age of 31, he was appointed director-general of the Energy Ministry and two years later, in 1990, he was appointed director-general of the Israel Electric Corporation.

===Knesset member===

In 1992, at the age of 34, Shalom was 34th on the Likud list for the 13th Knesset, but the party received only 33 seats in the elections. When former Defense Minister Moshe Arens resigned, Shalom succeeded him as an MK. 
As a young MK, his first bill was in the academic field. In 1992 there was room for only 100,000 university students, with no space for more. Shalom acted to allow all students to be accepted once others left their academic institutions at the end of their first year. His bill increased awareness about the problem and, as a result, Israeli colleges were established to expand access to academic studies. In 2010, for the first time, more students were enrolled in colleges than universities.
Shalom, during his first term, was the first male MK to be a member of the Knesset&#x27;s committee on the status of women. He was also the chairman of the subcommittee regarding the capital market, chairman of the subcommittee of energy and a member of the economic affairs committee.

===Deputy Defense Minister===
Following the 1996 election, Shalom, who won the 18th spot in the combined list of Likud and two other conservative parties, became Deputy Defense Minister under the minister Yitzhak Mordechai. One of his biggest achievements was enabling Hareidi Jews to serve in the army, a step that they had been avoiding for decades. The Hareidi battalion, &quot;Netzah Yehuda&quot;, was established in February 1999.

==Minister of Science==
After a rotation with MK Michael Eitan, Shalom, on 13 July 1998, became Minister of Science. During his year in office he created the &quot;science flowers&quot; project, which helped universities reach Israel&#x27;s periphery and helped underprivileged students excel. Another main project Shalom was involved in was in expanding Internet and broadband access in Israel.

==MK in the opposition (1999–2001)==
In the 1999 election, the Likud party, headed by the widely unpopular prime minister at the time, Benjamin Netanyahu, was running against the Labor party, headed by Ehud Barak. Labor won 26 seats in the Knesset, while Likud received only 19 seats and lost the election. After Labor gained power in 1999 and following Netanyahu&#x27;s resignation, Shalom became number one on the Likud list and became part of the opposition led by Ariel Sharon.
===Since 2001===
Shalom was the runner-up to Netanyahu for party leadership in December 2005 and was granted the second spot on the Likud list to the 2006 general election and thus did not compete in its 11 January 2006 primaries. He was placed seventh on the party&#x27;s list for the 2009 elections.

In January 2010, he asked Pope Benedict XVI to open the wartime archives of the papacy of Pius XII.

As Energy Minister Shalom led an Israeli delegation to Abu Dhabi on renewable energy in January 2014. The visit was controversial, as the United Arab Emirates did not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel and no Israeli leaders had traveled there since the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in 2010.

In May 2012, during a meeting with Likud activists in the city of Rehovot, Shalom said about the heads of Likud opposition to founding of a Palestinian state, &quot;We are all against a Palestinian state, there is no question about it.&quot;

Following the 2015 elections Shalom was appointed Interior Minister and Vice Prime Minister.

===Sexual harassment allegations===
On 24 March 2014, a woman complained that Shalom had sexually harassed her at work more than 15 years before. The police investigation was closed several months later by the Attorney General, Yehuda Weinstein, since the statute of limitations had already passed. Two other former employees also accused him of touching them against their will. All three alleged he had cornered them on various occasions and tried to kiss them. One woman said she was once summoned to a Jerusalem hotel room where Shalom was staying, only to find him waiting for her on the bed, wearing nothing but a bathrobe. Another said, &quot;He kissed me against my will, and when I tried to get away, he chased me into the bathroom.&quot; The third woman said that during one of their meetings, Shalom &quot;told me he&#x27;s had intimate thoughts about me for years and that he wanted to see me outside the office.&quot;

In the aftermath, Shalom decided not to submit his candidacy for the position of President of Israel. He had been considered a front-runner for the post before the allegation was made.

In late 2015, new allegations were made by women, triggering Shalom&#x27;s announcement on 21 December that he would withdraw from public life and resign. He denied all the allegations. &quot;For some 23 years, I have served the public with determination and faith as an MK and a minister in various offices out of a feeling I was fulfilling a mission and a desire to advance important social and public goals, but I have had enough of the torment inflicted on me and my family,&quot; Shalom said in a statement announcing his resignation. &quot;My family supports me, but there is no justification for the price they&#x27;ve had to pay.&quot; He was replaced by Amir Ohana as a member of Knesset.

The Attorney General instructed the Major Crimes Unit of the Israel Police to examine the new allegations. On 30 June 2016, Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit ended the preliminary examination of the allegations. The Justice Ministry issued a statement reading: &quot;Some of the women could not be located, or there was no grounds to approach them due to the quality of the information concerning them; some didn&#x27;t confirm the claims, and some didn&#x27;t rule out the claims, but decisively refused to give testimony to the police. Regardless, in some of the cases the statute of limitations expired on the information.&quot; Only one of the accusers filed an official police report. On 3 July 2016, a group of Members of Knesset and party activists began efforts to bring Shalom back into politics.

==Personal life==
From 1993 to 2017 Shalom was married to Israeli talk show host Judy Shalom Nir-Mozes. The couple have five children, including two sons from Mozes previous marriage.

<text>The Guinness Book of Astronomy is a book () by the British astronomer Patrick Moore, first published in 1979, and running to seven editions.

The first part of the book is written like a &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, with paragraphs like &quot;the most luminous star&quot;, &quot;the farthest star&quot;, and so on. Solar System objects are explained in detail.

The second part is a detailed sky atlas for amateur astronomy observations: for each constellation, a list of bright and dim stars, deep sky and other notable objects is given to the reader. The object tables are so complete that this book alone is enough for months of observations with small telescopes.

<doc id="222857" wikidata="Q170211" url="?curid=222857" title="McDonnell F-101 Voodoo">
<text>The McDonnell F-101 Voodoo is a supersonic jet fighter designed and produced by the American McDonnell Aircraft Corporation.

Development of the F-101 began in the late 1940s as a long-range bomber escort (then known as a penetration fighter) for the United States Air Force&#x27;s (USAF) Strategic Air Command (SAC). It was also adapted as a nuclear-armed fighter-bomber for the USAF&#x27;s Tactical Air Command (TAC), and as a photo reconnaissance aircraft. On 29 September 1954, it performed its maiden flight. The F-101A set world speed records for jet-powered aircraft, including airspeed, attaining per hour on 12 December 1957.

Delays in the 1954 interceptor project led to demands for an interim interceptor aircraft design, a role that was eventually won by the F-101B Voodoo. This role required extensive modifications to add a large radar to the nose of the aircraft, a second crew member to operate it, and a new weapons bay using a rotating door that held its four AIM-4 Falcon missiles or two AIR-2 Genie rockets hidden within the airframe until it was time to be fired. The F-101B entered service with USAF Air Defense Command in 1959 and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in 1961. While the Voodoo was a moderate success, it may have been more important as an evolutionary step towards its replacement in most roles, the F-4 Phantom II, one of the most successful Western fighter designs of the 1950s; the Phantom would retain the twin engines, twin crew for interception duties, and a tail mounted well above and behind the jet exhaust, although it was an evolution of the F3H Demon while the Voodoo was developed from the earlier XF-88 Voodoo.

The Voodoo&#x27;s career as a fighter-bomber was relatively brief, but the reconnaissance versions served for some time. Along with the USAF&#x27;s Lockheed U-2 and US Navy&#x27;s Vought RF-8 Crusaders, the RF-101 reconnaissance variant of the Voodoo was instrumental during the Cuban Missile Crisis and saw extensive service during the Vietnam War. Interceptor versions served with the Air National Guard until 1982, and in Canadian service, they were a front line part of NORAD until their replacement with the CF-18 Hornet in the 1980s. The type was operated in the reconnaissance role until 1979. The US Air National Guard operated former USAF Voodoos until 1982. The RCAF Voodoos were in service until 1984.

==Design and development==
===Background and XF-88===
Initial design on what would eventually become the Voodoo began in June 1946 in response to a USAAF Penetration Fighter Competition launched just after World War II. This competition called for a long-range, high-performance fighter to escort a new generation of bombers, similar to the wartime role of the North American P-51 Mustang in escorting the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated B-24 Liberators across contested airspace. McDonnell was among several companies to respond to the competition; their design benefitted from recently captured German research into high-speed jet aircraft.

On 14 February 1947, McDonnell was awarded a contract (&quot;AC-14582&quot;) to produce a pair of prototypes, designated XF-88 Voodoo. The first prototype (serial number &quot;46-6525&quot;), which was powered by two 3,000 lbf (13.3 kN) Westinghouse XJ34-WE-13 turbojets, flew from Muroc on 20 October 1948. Preliminary testing revealed that while handling and range were adequate, the top speed was a disappointing 641 mph (1,032 km/h) at sea level. After fitting McDonnell-designed afterburners to the second prototype, thrust was increased to 3,600 lbf (16.1 kN) with corresponding performance increases in top speed, initial rate of climb, and reduced takeoff distance. Fuel consumption also increased, reducing range.

The XF-88 won the &quot;fly-off&quot; competition against the competing Lockheed XF-90 and North American YF-93. But the detonation of the first nuclear weapon by the Soviet Union led the United States Air Force (USAF) to raise the priority of interceptors and reduce that of bomber escorts, and it terminated the Penetration Fighter program in 1950. Another factor in the termination was budgetary limitations. Analysis of Korean War missions, however, revealed that contemporary USAF strategic bombers were vulnerable to fighter interception. In early 1951, the USAF issued a new requirement for a bomber escort, to which all major US manufacturers submitted designs. The McDonnell design, a larger and higher-powered version of the XF-88, won the bid in May 1951. Six months later, the redesigned F-88 was designated F-101 Voodoo.

===Enlarged design===
The new design was considerably larger, carrying three times the initial fuel load and designed around larger, more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 turbojets. The greater dimensions of the J57 engines required modifications to the engine bays, and modification to the intakes to allow a larger amount of airflow to the engine. The new intakes were also designed to be more efficient at higher Mach numbers. In order to increase aerodynamic efficiency, reduce structural weight and alleviate pitch-up phenomena recently identified in-flight testing of the Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket, an aircraft with a control surface configuration similar to the XF-88, the horizontal tail was relocated to the top of the vertical stabilizer, giving the F-101 its signature &quot;T-tail&quot;. In late 1952, the mission of the F-101 was changed from &quot;penetration fighter&quot; to &quot;strategic fighter&quot;, which entailed equal emphasis on both the bomber escort mission and on nuclear weapons delivery. The new Voodoo mock-up with the reconfigured inlets, tail surfaces, landing gear, and dummy nuclear weapon was inspected by Air Force officials in March 1953. The design was approved, leading to an initial production order for 29 F-101As being placed on 28 May 1953. No prototypes were required as the F-101 was considered to be a straightforward development of the XF-88, with the Cook-Cragie production policy, in which initial low-rate production would be used for testing without the use of separate prototypes, chosen instead.

===Changing roles and into production===
Despite securing an order for the type, McDonnell received a stop order for production on 16 April 1954; this was due to a substantial cutback in funding for the USAF in general. Meaningful production activity was not resumed until a favourable instruction was received by the company on 2 November 1954. At this point, the USAF gave McDonnell an operational deadline of early 1957.

The first production aircraft, F-101A serial number &quot;53-2418&quot;, performed its maiden flight on 29 September 1954 from Edwards AFB; during this flight, it attained a maximum speed of at an altitude of . This aircraft, which is privately owned, has been moved to the Evergreen Maintenance Center in Marana, Arizona, restored, and now on display at the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon. It was previously on display at the Pueblo Weisbrod Aircraft Museum.

The end of the Korean War and the development of the jet-powered Boeing B-52 Stratofortress negated the need for fighter escort and Strategic Air Command (SAC) opted to withdraw from the program. Despite SAC&#x27;s loss of interest, the F-101A had attracted the attention of Tactical Air Command (TAC), leading to the F-101 being reconfigured as a fighter bomber. In this capacity, it was intended to carry a single nuclear weapon for use against tactical targets such as airfields. TAC requested numerous alterations to the F-101 to suit the new role, including additional apparatus to permit air-to-ground communication, provisions to carry external pods, and structural strengthening.

Through the support of TAC, testing of the F-101 was resumed, with Category II flight tests beginning in early 1955. A number of problems were identified and were mostly resolved during this phase of development. Issues were found with the autopilot, hydraulics, viewfinder, and control system; McDonnell typically replaced unsatisfactory parts with redesigned counterparts. One particular issue was the aircraft&#x27;s dangerous tendency towards severe pitch-up when flown at a high angle of attack; this would never be entirely rectified. However, the USAF was satisfied with the installation of an active inhibitor system to deter such instances. Around 2,300 improvements were made to the F-101 between 1955 and 1956 ahead of full-rate production commencing in November 1956.

==Operational history==

===F-101A / RF-101G===
On 2 May 1957, the first F-101A was delivered to the 27th Strategic Fighter Wing, which transferred to TAC in July that year, replacing their F-84F Thunderstreak. The F-101A was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney J57-P-13 turbojets, allowing good acceleration, a high rate of climb, ease in penetrating the sound barrier in level flight, and a maximum performance of Mach 1.52. The F-101&#x27;s large internal fuel capacity allowed a range of approximately nonstop. The aircraft was fitted with an MA-7 fire-control radar for both air-to-air and air-to-ground use, augmented by a Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS) for delivering nuclear weapons, and was designed to carry a Mk 28 nuclear bomb. The original intended payload for the F-101A was the McDonnell Model 96 store, a large fuel/weapons pod similar in concept to that of the Convair B-58 Hustler, but was cancelled in March 1956 before the F-101 entered service. Other operational nuclear payloads included the Mk 7, Mk 43, and Mk 57 weapons. While theoretically capable of carrying conventional bombs, rockets, or Falcon air-to-air missiles, the Voodoo never used such weapons operationally. It was fitted with four 20mm M39 cannon, with one cannon often removed in service to make room for a TACAN beacon-receiver.

The F-101 set a number of speed records, including: a JF-101A (the ninth F-101A modified as a testbed for the more powerful J-57-P-53 engines of the F-101B) setting a world speed record of 1,207.6 mph (1,943.4 km/h) on 12 December 1957 during &quot;Operation Firewall&quot;, beating the previous record of 1,132 mph (1,811 km/h) set by the Fairey Delta 2 in March the previous year. The record was then subsequently taken in May 1958 by a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. On 27 November 1957, during &quot;Operation Sun Run,&quot; an RF-101C set the Los Angeles-New York City-Los Angeles record in six hours and 46 minutes, the New York to Los Angeles record in three hours and 36 minutes, and the Los Angeles to New York record in three hours and seven minutes.

A total of 77 F-101As were built, only 50 of which were ever used operationally while the remainder were used exclusively for experimental work. They were gradually withdrawn from USAF service starting in 1966. Twenty-nine survivors were converted to &quot;RF-101G&quot; specifications with a modified nose, housing reconnaissance cameras in place of cannons and radar. These served with the Air National Guard through 1972.

===RF-101A===
In October 1953, the USAF requested that two F-101As be built as prototype YRF-101A tactical reconnaissance aircraft. These were followed by 35 RF-101A production aircraft. The RF-101A shared the airframe of the F-101A, including its 6.33 &quot;g&quot; (62 m/s²) limit, but replaced the radar and cannons with up to six cameras in the reshaped nose. Various electronics were incorporated at the request of TAC. Like all other models of the F-101, it had provision for both flying boom and probe-and-drogue in-flight refueling capability, as well as for a buddy tank that allowed it to refuel other aircraft. It entered service in May 1957, replacing the RB-57 Canberra.

On 6 May 1957, the RF-101A entered service, the first unit to operate the type being 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, stationed at Shaw AFB, South Carolina. On July 15, 1958, the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing deployed 8 RF-101s to Incirlik Air Base during the 1958 Lebanon crisis to support the Marine landing in Beirut to form a composite air strike force with B-57s, RB-66s, C-124s, F-100s, and Lockheed C-130 Hercules. During October 1962, RF-101As from the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing performed reconnaissance sorties over Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Allegedly, the aircraft&#x27;s performance over Cuba highlighted its shortcomings as a reconnaissance aircraft, motivating a series of modifications to improve its performance. All USAF RF-101As were phased out of service during 1971.

During October 1959, eight RF-101As were transferred to Taiwan, which used them for overflights of the Chinese mainland. These ROCAF RF-101A were modified with the RF-101C vertical fins and air intake; this intake was used to cool the drag chute compartment and eliminated the five minute limit on using the afterburners on the RF-101A. Two were reportedly shot down.

===F-101B / CF-101B / EF-101B===

In the late 1940s, the USAF had started a research project into future interceptor aircraft that eventually settled on an advanced specification known as the 1954 interceptor. Contracts for this specification eventually resulted in the selection of the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, but by 1952 it was becoming clear that few parts of the specification other than the airframe would be ready by 1954; the engines, weapons, and fire control systems were all going to take too long to get into service. Thus, an effort was started to quickly produce an interim supersonic design to replace the various subsonic interceptors then in service, and the F-101 airframe was selected as a starting point.

Although McDonnell proposed the designation &quot;F-109&quot; for the new aircraft (which was to be a substantial departure from the basic Voodoo), the USAF assigned the designation F-101B. It was first deployed into service on 5 January 1959, with the 60th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. Production of this model ended in March 1961. The Voodoo featured a modified cockpit to carry a crew of two, with a larger and more rounded forward fuselage to hold the Hughes MG-13 fire control radar of the F-102. It had a data link to the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, allowing ground controllers to steer the aircraft towards its targets by making adjustments through the plane&#x27;s autopilot. The F-101B had more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J57-P-55 engines, making it the only Voodoo not using the −13 engines. The new engines featured a substantially longer afterburner than J57-P-13s. To avoid a major redesign, the extended afterburners were simply allowed to extend out of the fuselage by almost 8  ft (2.4 m). The more powerful engines and aerodynamic refinements allowed an increased speed of Mach 1.85.

The F-101B was stripped of the four M39 cannons and carried four AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missiles instead, arranged two apiece on a rotating pallet in the fuselage weapons bay. The initial load was two GAR-1 (AIM-4A) semi-active radar homing and two GAR-2 (AIM-4B) infrared-guided weapons with one of each carried on each side of the rotating pallet. After the first two missiles were fired, the door turned over to expose the second pair. Standard practice was to fire the weapons in SARH/IR pairs to increase the likelihood of a hit. Late-production models had provision for two 1.7-kiloton MB-1/AIR-2 Genie nuclear rockets on one side of the pallet with IR-guided GAR-2A (AIM-4C) on the other side. &quot;Project Kitty Car&quot; upgraded most earlier F-101Bs to this standard beginning in 1961.
Between 1963 and 1966, F-101Bs were upgraded under the Interceptor Improvement Program (IIP; also known as &quot;Project Bold Journey&quot;), being outfitted with a fire control system enhancement against hostile ECM and an infrared sighting and tracking (IRST) system in the nose in place of the in-flight refueling probe.

The F-101B was produced in greater numbers than the F-101A and F-101C, with a total of 479 being delivered by the end of production in 1961. Most of these were delivered to the Air Defense Command (ADC) beginning in January 1959. The only foreign customer for the F-101B was Canada, where it was locally referred to as the CF-101 Voodoo.

The F-101B was withdrawn from ADC service between 1968 and 1971, with many surviving USAF aircraft transferred to the Air National Guard (replacing F-102s), serving until 1982. The last Voodoo in US service (F-101B-105-MC, AF Ser. No. &quot;58-300&quot;) was finally retired by the 2nd Fighter Weapons Squadron at Tyndall AFB, Florida on 21 September 1982.

===F-101C / RF-101H===
The F-101A fighter-bomber had been accepted into TAC service despite a number of problems. Among others, its airframe had proven to be capable of withstanding only 6.33 &quot;g&quot; (62 m/s²) maneuvers, rather than the intended 7.33 &quot;g&quot; (72 m/s²). An improved model, the F-101C, was introduced in 1957. It had a 500 lb (227 kg) heavier structure to allow 7.33-&quot;g&quot; maneuvers as well as a revised fuel system to increase the maximum flight time in afterburner. Like the F-101A, it was also fitted with an underfuselage pylon for carrying nuclear weapons, as well as two hardpoints for drop tanks. A total of 47 F101Cs were produced.
Originally serving with the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, the aircraft was transferred in 1958 from TAC to the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing, part of United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) which operated three squadrons from the twin RAF air stations Bentwaters &amp; Woodbridge. The 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron was stationed at Woodbridge, while the 91st and 92nd were stationed at Bentwaters. The 81st TFW served as a strategic nuclear deterrent force, the Voodoo&#x27;s long-range putting almost all of the Warsaw Pact countries, and targets up to deep into the Soviet Union within reach.

Both the A and C model aircraft were assigned to the 81st TFW and were used interchangeably within the three squadrons. Operational F-101A/C were upgraded in service with Low Angle Drogued Delivery (LADD) and Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS) equipment for its primary mission of delivering nuclear weapons at extremely low altitudes. Pilots were trained for high speed, low-level missions into Soviet or Eastern Bloc territory, with primary targets being airfields. These missions were expected to be one-way, with the pilots having to eject behind Soviet lines.

The F-101C never saw combat and was replaced in 1966 with the F-4C Phantom II. Thirty-two aircraft were later converted for unarmed reconnaissance use with the &quot;RF-101H&quot; designation. They served with Air National Guard units until 1972.

===RF-101C===

Using the reinforced airframe of the F-101C, the RF-101C first flew on 12 July 1957, entering service in 1958. Like the RF-101A, the RF-101C had up to six cameras in place of radar and cannons in the reshaped nose and retained the bombing ability of the fighter-bomber versions. As it was intended to be flown unarmed, various passive defensive systems were incorporated, including the AN/APS-54 radar warning receiver. It lacked a true all-weather capability due to the USAF choosing to eliminate the AN/APN-82 electronic navigation system planned for it. 166 RF-101Cs were built, including 96 originally scheduled to be F-101C fighter-bombers.

On 27 November 1957, during Operation Sun Run, an RF-101C piloted by then-Captain Robert Sweet set the Los Angeles-New York City-Los Angeles record in six hours and 46 minutes, and New York to Los Angeles record in three hours and 36 minutes. Another RF-101C, piloted by then-Lieutenant Gustav Klatt, set a Los Angeles to New York record of three hours and seven minutes.

The RF-101C saw service during the Cuban Missile Crisis and soon followed the North American F-100 Super Sabres in October 1961, into combat when RF-101s from the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing deployed to south east Asia, performing reconnaissance flights over Laos and Vietnam. Operations in this theatre quickly exposed the need for nighttime reconnaissance, for which the aircraft was not originally equipped to perform. The 1964 Project &quot;Toy Tiger&quot; fitted some RF-101C with a new camera package and a centerline pod for photo-flash cartridges. Some were further upgraded under the Mod 1181 program with automatic control for the cameras. Some officials remained dissatisfied with the RF-101C&#x27;s nighttime photographic capability.

The RF-101C acted as pathfinders for F-100 bombers during early strikes in the theatre. The RF-101C sustained losses during the conflict, the first loss to enemy ground fire was recorded in November 1964, although close calls occurred as early as 14 August 1962; North Vietnamese air defenses became increasingly effective over time. From 1965 through November 1970, its role was gradually taken over by the RF-4C Phantom II. In some 35,000 sorties, 39 aircraft were lost, 33 in combat, including five to SAMs, one to an airfield attack, and one in air combat to a MiG-21 in September 1967. The RF-101C&#x27;s speed made it largely immune to MiG interception. 27 of the combat losses occurred on reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam. In April 1967, ALQ-71 ECM pods were fitted to provide some protection against SAMs. Although the Voodoo could again operate at medium altitudes, the added drag and weight decreased the RF-101&#x27;s speed enough to be vulnerable to the maneuverable (and cannon-equipped) MiGs and thus require fighter escort.

After its withdrawal from Vietnam, the RF-101C continued to serve with USAF units through 1979. In service, the RF-101C was nicknamed the &quot;Long Bird&quot;; it was the only version of the Voodoo to see combat.

In total 166 were built.

===TF-101B / F-101F / CF-101F===
Some of the F-101Bs were completed as dual-control operational trainer aircraft initially dubbed &quot;TF-101B&quot;, but later redesignated &quot;F-101F&quot;. Seventy-nine new-build F-101Fs were manufactured, and 152 more existing aircraft were later modified with dual controls. Ten of these were supplied to Canada under the designation &quot;CF-101F&quot;. These were later replaced with 10 updated aircraft in 1971.

===RF-101B===

In the early 1970s, a batch of 22 former RCAF CF-101Bs was delivered to the USAF and converted into &quot;RF-101B&quot; reconnaissance aircraft, each aircraft had its radar and weapons bay replaced with a set of three KS-87B cameras and two AXQ-2 TV cameras. An in-flight refueling boom receptacle was also installed. These aircraft served with the 192d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the Nevada Air National Guard through 1975. They proved to be relatively expensive to operate and maintain and had a short service life.

<text>Financial cryptography is the use of cryptography in applications in which financial loss could result from subversion of the message system. Financial cryptography is distinguished from traditional cryptography in that for most of recorded history, cryptography has been used almost entirely for military and diplomatic purposes.

Financial cryptography includes the mechanisms and algorithms necessary for the protection of financial transfers, in addition to the creation of new forms of money. Proof of work and various auction protocols fall under the umbrella of Financial cryptography. Hashcash is being used to limit spam.

Financial cryptography has been seen to have a very broad scope of application. Ian Grigg sees financial cryptography in seven layers, being the combination of seven distinct disciplines: cryptography, software engineering, rights, accounting, governance, value, and financial applications. Business failures can often be traced to the absence of one or more of these disciplines, or to poor application of them. This views Financial cryptography as an appropriately cross-discipline subject. Indeed, inevitably so, given that finance and cryptography are each built upon multiple disciplines.

==History==

Cryptographers think the field originated from the work of Dr David Chaum who invented the blind signature. The blind signature is a special form of a cryptographic signature which allowed virtual coins to be signed without the signer seeing the actual coin. It permitted a form of digital token money that prevented traceability. This form is sometimes known as digital currency. Similar concepts are now being applied to modern blockchain technologies.

A system that was widely used during the 1970s-1990s and previously developed cryptographic mechanism is the Data Encryption Standard, which was used primarily for the protection of electronic funds transfers. However, it was the work of David Chaum that excited the cryptography community about the potential of encrypted messages as actual financial instruments.

As part of a business model, Financial cryptography followed the guide of cryptography and only the simplest ideas were adopted. Account money systems protected by SSL such as PayPal and e-gold were relatively successful. In 2001, PayPal processed $3.1 billion in payments, averaging 189,000 transactions daily totaling $9.6 million.

But more innovative mechanisms, including blinded token money, struggled to gain traction. David Chaum&#x27;s DigiCash, opened in 1989, filed for bankruptcy protection in November 1998. Two competitive rivals also failed to remain viable. First Virtual Holdings abandoned its business in August 1998. CyberCash ceased its &quot;CyberCoin&quot; in early 1999.

==Associations==
Financial cryptography is to some extent organized around the annual meeting of the &quot;International Financial Cryptography Association&quot;, which is held each year in a different location.

<text>The domain com is a top-level domain (TLD) in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. Created in the first group of Internet domains in March of 1985, its name is derived from the word &quot;commercial&quot;, indicating its original intended purpose for subdomains registered by commercial organizations. Later, the domain opened for general purposes.

The domain was originally administered by the United States Department of Defense, but is today operated by Verisign, and remains under ultimate jurisdiction of U.S. law. The &quot;.com&quot; domain is also more commonly used than the more specific &quot;.us&quot; by American businesses and enterprises. Verisign registrations in the .com domain are processed via registrars accredited by ICANN. The registry accepts internationalized domain names.

The domain was one of the original TLDs of the Internet when the Domain Name System was implemented in January 1985, the others being edu, gov, mil, net, org, and int. It has grown into the largest top-level domain, and has lent its name to the dot-com bubble, the era of the late 1990s during which excessive speculation in Internet-related concepts and companies led to rapid growth in the use and adoption of the Internet.

==History==
The domain &quot;com&quot; was one of the first set of top-level domains when the Domain Name System was first implemented for the Internet on January 1, 1985. The domain was administered by the U.S. Department of Defense, but the department contracted the domain maintenance to SRI International. SRI created DDN-NIC, also known as SRI-NIC, or simply &quot;the NIC&quot; (Network Information Center), then accessible online with the domain name nic.ddn.mil. Beginning October 1, 1991, an operations contract was awarded to Government Systems Inc. (GSI), which sub-contracted it to Network Solutions Inc. (NSI).

On January 1, 1993, the National Science Foundation assumed responsibility of maintenance, as com was primarily being used for non-defense interests. The NSF contracted operation to Network Solutions (NSI). In 1995, the NSF authorized NSI to begin charging registrants an annual fee for the first time since the domain&#x27;s inception. Initially, the fee was US$50 () per year, with US$35 going to NSI, and US$15 going to a government fund. New registrations had to pay for the first two years, making the new-domain registration fee US$100. In 1997, the United States Department of Commerce assumed authority over these first seven generic TLDs. It is currently operated by Verisign, which had acquired Network Solutions. Verisign later spun off Network Solutions&#x27; non-registry functions into a separate company that continues as a registrar. In the English language, the domain is often spelled with a leading period and commonly pronounced as &quot;dot-com&quot;, and has entered common parlance this way.

Although com domains were initially intended to designate commercial entities, the domain has had no restrictions for eligible registrants since the mid-1990s. With the commercialization and popularization of the Internet, the domain was opened to the public and quickly became the most common top-level domain for websites, email, and networking. Many companies that flourished in the period from 1997 to 2001—the time known as the &quot;dot-com bubble&quot;—incorporated the label &quot;com&quot; into company names; these became known as dot-coms or dot-com companies. The introduction of domain &quot;biz&quot; in 2001, which was aimed at companies that failed to register a suitable com-domain name, intended to make customers realize that they had arrived at a legitimate business website, although it did not achieve widespread use.

Although companies anywhere in the world can register &quot;com&quot; domains, many countries have a second-level domain with a similar purpose under their country code top-level domain (ccTLD), such as Australia (com.au), China (com.cn), Greece (com.gr), Israel (co.il), India (co.in), Indonesia (co.id), Japan (co.jp), Mexico (com.mx), Nepal (.com.np), Pakistan (.com.pk), South Korea (co.kr), Sri Lanka (com.lk), United Kingdom (co.uk), and Vietnam (.com.vn).

Many non-commercial sites and networks use com names to benefit from the perceived recognizability of a com domain. However, the registration statistics show varying popularity over the years.

In December 2011, Verisign reported that approximately 100 million com domains were registered. According to the Domain Name Industry Brief published in March 2020, which publishes every quarter, com domain registration totaled 145.4 million. As of March 2009, Verisign reported that 926 accredited registrars serve the domain.

On November 29, 2012, the U.S. Department of Commerce approved the renewal of the com Registry Agreement between Verisign, Inc., and ICANN. Through this agreement, Verisign managed the com registry until November 30, 2018.

<text>Thomas Eugene White Jr. (born December 14, 1943) is an American businessman and former United States Army officer who served as a senior executive for a subsidiary of the now collapsed Enron and as the United States Secretary of the Army from May 31, 2001 until November 17, 2004.

==Military career and education==
White was born in Detroit, Michigan. In 1963 White graduated from Cass Technical High School in Detroit. He was a part of the JROTC program at Cass Tech, which is highly ranked every year in military competition. In 1967, White graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned in the United States Army. In 1974, he received a Master of Science degree in operations research from the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. In 1984, he attended the United States Army War College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

During a long military career, that included two tours of duty in Vietnam, he served in a variety of capacities including:

*Commander, 1st Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment
*Commander, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, V Corps
*Director, Armor/Anti-Armor Special Task Force

In 1989, White was appointed executive assistant to the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell, where he was described in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; by a mutual friend as Powell&#x27;s &quot;alter ego&quot; in &quot;a job that requires tremendous political sophistication.&quot; In July 1990 White retired from the Army with the rank of Brigadier General.

==Business career==
In 1990 White entered the private sector as Vice-Chairman of Enron Energy Services (E.E.S.), a subsidiary of the Enron Corporation responsible for providing energy outsource solutions. According to his original Department of Defense biography White was responsible for the delivery component of energy management services, which included:

*Commodity management
*Purchasing, maintaining and operating energy assets
*Developing and implementing energy information services
*Capital management
*Facilities management

He was responsible for the Enron Engineering and Construction Company, which managed an extensive construction portfolio with domestic and international projects. White also served as a member of Enron&#x27;s Executive Committee and was chairman and chief executive officer for Enron Operations Corporation.

==Appointment as Secretary of the Army==

White was a controversial choice for Government service despite his long military service due to his most recent position as an executive with the Enron Corporation. U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld however had decided to make corporate experience one of the key requirements in his appointees.

White was sworn in on May 31, 2001 as 18th Secretary of the Army and was responsible for all matters relating to Army manpower, personnel, reserve affairs, installations, environmental issues, weapons systems and equipment acquisition, communications, and financial management. He led a work-force of over one million active duty, National Guard and Army Reserve soldiers and 270,000 civilian employees, he had stewardship over 15 million acres (60,000 km2) of land and an annual budget of nearly $70 billion.

White was immediately embroiled in controversy regarding his previous employment with Enron and what he may have known about some of Enron&#x27;s questionable business practices. His retention of a sizable amount of Enron stock fueled the perception of a conflict interest.

In 2002, White became involved with a dispute with Donald Rumsfeld over the proposed cancellation of the Army&#x27;s Crusader artillery project. White supported the Army view that the Crusader was vital to the Army&#x27;s future and circulated &quot;talking points&quot; for congressional discussions extolling its value. However, Rumsfeld decided it was not suited for wars of the future and eventually canceled the program.
In 2003, White refused to publicly rebuke General Eric Shinseki for his statement to the Senate Armed services committee that it would take &quot;something in the order of several hundred thousand soldiers&quot; to occupy Iraq after invasion. This, combined with White&#x27;s actions on the Crusader, disagreements with Rumsfeld on the Stryker project, and his distracting association with Enron including the selling of restricted Enron stock through &quot;private investments&quot; (derivatives), prompted Rumsfeld to demand White&#x27;s resignation. White resigned on April 25, 2003.

==Controversy==
While serving as Vice Chairman of Enron Energy Services White had actively pursued military contracts for the company and in 1999 had secured a prototype deal at Fort Hamilton for privatizing the power supply of army bases. Enron had been the only bidder for this deal after White had controversially used his government and military contacts to secure key concessions.

In his first speech just &quot;two weeks after he became secretary of the Army, White vowed to speed up the awarding of such contracts&quot;; as the Enron Ft. Hamilton contract, despite the fact that he still held a considerable interest in Enron. A Pentagon spokeswoman responded to suggestions of a possible conflict of interests by saying that &quot;Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld sees no conflict and has complete confidence in the Army secretary&quot;.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that in late October 2001, White made numerous phone calls to Enron executives including Vice President Jude Rolfes, former CEO Jeff Skilling and President current CEO Ken Lay. Shortly after the calls were made, White unloaded 200,000 Enron shares for $12 million. The &quot;L.A. Times&quot; reported that White had brief conversations with Rumsfeld in November and Powell in December, the focus of which were &quot;a concern on their part for the impact that the bankruptcy of Enron may have had on my personal well-being. My response in both cases was that I had suffered significant personal losses but that I would persevere.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that in late January 2002, Rep. Henry Waxman requested a meeting with White regarding the military contracts and the irregularities with the accounting at E.E.S. stating &quot;you are in a unique position because you are the person in government who has the most intimate knowledge of Enron&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that at this time White still held interests in Enron, including a claim on 50,000 stock options and an annuity paid by the company, despite having promised to divest himself at his confirmation hearing 8 months earlier. This earned him a rebuke from Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John Warner (R-Va.) of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He was also accused in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; of Misuse of Government Property, by allegedly using military jets for personal trips for himself and his wife. In July, following news reports of the company&#x27;s involvement in the 2000–2001 California electricity crisis, White denied his involvement under oath before the Senate Commerce Committee.

<text>Olga Valentinovna Korbut (born 16 May 1955) is a Belarusian retired gymnast who competed for the Soviet Union. Nicknamed the &quot;Sparrow from Minsk&quot;, she won four gold medals and two silver medals at the Summer Olympic Games, in which she competed in 1972 and 1976 for the Soviet team, and was the inaugural inductee to the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1988.

Korbut retired from gymnastics in 1977 at the age of 22, considered young for gymnasts of the period, but her influence and legacy in gymnastics were far-reaching. Korbut&#x27;s 1972 Olympic performances are widely credited as redefining gymnastics, changing the sport from emphasising ballet and elegance to acrobatics, as well as changing gymnastics from a niche sport to one of the most popular sports in the world. She emigrated to the United States in 1991, where she now lives and trains gymnasts. She became a citizen in 2000.

==Early life==
Korbut was born in Grodno to Valentin and Valentina Korbut. After World War II, the family moved to Grodno from Dubniaki (small town near Kalinkavichy). She started training at age 8, and entered a Belarusian sports school headed by coach Renald Knysh at age 9. There, Korbut&#x27;s first trainer was Elena Volchetskaya, an Olympic gold medalist (1964), but she was moved to Knysh&#x27;s group a year later. Initially he found her &quot;lazy and capricious&quot; but he also saw potential in her great talent, unusually supple spine, and charisma. With him, she learned a difficult backward somersault on the balance beam. She debuted this at a competition in the USSR in 1969. The same year, Korbut completed a backflip-to-catch on the uneven bars; this was the first backward release move ever performed by a woman on bars.

She finished fifth at her first competition in the 1969 USSR championships, where she was allowed to compete as a 14-year-old. The next year, she won a gold medal in the vault. Due to illness and injury, she was unable to compete in many of the competitions before the 1972 Summer Olympics.

==Olympics==
At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Korbut&#x27;s acrobatics and open high-level gymnastics brought her much fame. During the Olympics, Korbut was one of the favorites for the all-around after her dynamic performance in the team competition, however she missed her mount on bars three times and the title went to teammate Ludmilla Tourischeva. That said, Korbut won three gold medals for the balance beam, floor exercise, and team competitions. In one of the most controversial finishes of all time, she took a silver medal in the uneven bars. Korbut&#x27;s first attempt at her uneven bars routine was marred by several mistakes which all but ended her chances of winning a gold medal in the all-around. The next day, Korbut repeated the same routine in the event finals, although this time successfully. After the boards displayed a score of 9.8, the audience began to whistle and shout vulgar remarks at the judges in disapproval, believing her score to be too low. This carried on for several minutes but the judges refused to change their score.

Korbut is most famous for her uneven bars and balance beam routines, as well as her charismatic performances that captivated audiences. In 1973, she won the Russian and World Student (i.e., University) Games, and a silver medal in the all-around at the European Championships.

At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Soviet coaches and officials had designated Korbut as the woman who could beat the Romanian prodigy, Nadia Comăneci, but Korbut was injured and her performances in the games were sub-par. She was overshadowed not only by Comăneci, but also by her own teammate Nellie Kim. She did collect a team gold medal, and an individual silver medal for the balance beam.

==Retirement and life after the Olympics==

Korbut graduated from the Grodno Pedagogical Institute in 1977, became a teacher, and retired from gymnastic competition. She married Leonid Bortkevich, a member of Belarusian folk band Pesniary. The couple had a son, Richard, born in 1979. In 1988, Korbut became the first gymnast inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

In 1991, she and her family immigrated to the United States, prompted by concerns about the aftereffects of the Chernobyl disaster on Belarus. They settled in New Jersey, where she taught gymnastics. Two years later, the family moved to the U.S. state of Georgia, where she continued to coach. Korbut and Bortkevich divorced in 2000, the same year she became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In 2002, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, to become head coach at Scottsdale Gymnastics and Cheerleading. Korbut was also featured on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Boxing&quot;, which aired on May 22, 2002, with her opponent, Darva Conger, winning by unanimous decision. Since then, Korbut has worked with private gymnastics students and done motivational speaking.

During the 2012 Summer Olympics, in London, Korbut appeared Twitter and Facebook, providing live, on-site commentary on the gymnastics competitions in the North Greenwich Arena. During the games, the Royal Opera House hosted an exhibition created in collaboration with the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, entitled &quot;The Olympic Journey, The Story of the Games&quot;. Along with historical artifacts, the show featured the personal narratives of 16 Olympic medalists, including Korbut. Her appearance at the exhibition on August 3rd of that year marked the 40th anniversary of her Olympic victories. &quot;I didn&#x27;t even expect this,&quot; she said. &quot;I am so honored to be here.&quot;

In 2017, Korbut sold her 1972 and 1976 Olympic medals, among 32 lots (including two golds and a silver from the Munich Olympics), which fetched $333,500 at Heritage Auctions.

In 1999, she spoke out about the sexual assault and rape she had suffered at the hands of her coach, Renald Knysh, which he denied. &quot;The truth was that many of the gymnasts were not just sport machines, but sexual slaves to the trainer,&quot; Korbut stated. &quot;We were not just potential gymnasts, but future concubines for himself.&quot; Later, in 2018, Korbut appeared on a TV show, in which she again spoke out about several incidents of sexual assault by her coach. As a result of her speaking out publicly, several other gymnasts, who had also trained under Knysh, came forward to reveal their own similar experiences of sexual assault.

In 2021, Korbut was named by Carnegie Corporation of New York as an honoree of the Great Immigrants Award.

==Legacy==

Korbut, who has won four Olympic gold medals, is best known for her move, the Korbut flip, a backflip performed on the uneven parallel bars, starting from a standing position on the high bar and then catching the same bar from below on the under swing. She also achieved the flip on the 4&quot; balance bar onto the straddle position and later the flip landing on her feet. Named after Korbut since she was the first to perform the skill at an international competition in 1972, the move has since been made illegal in the Olympic Code of Points.

After the 1972 Olympic competition, she also met United States President Richard Nixon at the White House. About the meeting, Korbut said: &quot;He told me that my performance in Munich did more for reducing the political tension during the Cold War between our two countries than the embassies were able to do in five years.&quot; In addition to greatly publicizing gymnastics worldwide, she also contributed to a marked change in the tenor of the sport itself. Prior to 1972, the athletes were generally older and the focus was on elegance rather than acrobatics. In the decade after Korbut&#x27;s Olympic debut, the emphasis was reversed. Korbut, in her 1972, gold-medal Olympics, at and , exemplified the deliberate and purposeful trend toward smaller women in the sport.

Her 1972 Olympic achievement earned her the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year and ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports title of Athlete of the Year. In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002 the public voted &quot;Olga Korbut charms the world&quot; No.46 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. 

With her display of artistry and grace Korbut, along with Nadia Comăneci, brought unprecedented popularity to the sport in the early to mid-1970s, attributes which are now seen as a lost art in gymnastics with athleticism taking precedence.

===Eponymous skills===
Korbut has one eponymous vault listed in the Code of Points. She also performed the Korbut flip on both the uneven bars and the balance beam. The uneven bars version was removed from the Code of Points after standing on top of the high bar was banned. The balance beam version is not officially listed under her name due to the low difficulty value.
===In popular culture===
In a &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip published on 15 May 1973, the character Snoopy is seen doing balance beam positions with flawless precision on top of his doghouse for three panels until coming to a rest in the fourth one saying: &quot;Olga Korbut has been bugging me for lessons!&quot;

In &quot;X-Men&quot; #99 (June 1976), Nightcrawler makes a slight reference to Korbut&#x27;s gymnastic skills in comparison to his own, to which Colossus, a fellow Soviet, admonishes him for it.

<text>The Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the east of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) the district-free city Worms, the district Bergstraße, district-free Mannheim, Frankenthal and Ludwigshafen, Rhein-Neckar, district-free Speyer, the districts Karlsruhe, Germersheim, Südliche Weinstraße and Bad Dürkheim.

==History==
The district was created in 1886 under the name &quot;Bezirksamt Ludwigshafen&quot;, one of the last acts of king Ludwig II of Bavaria. The population in the area around Speyer had grown significantly, which made the splitting of the &quot;Bezirksamt Speyer&quot; necessary. In 1969, the Speyer and Ludwigshafen districts and parts of the Frankenthal and Neustadt districts were merged again to form the new Ludwigshafen district.

On May 19, 2003, the district parliament passed a resolution to rename the district &quot;Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis&quot; starting in 2004.

==Partnerships==
The district started its first partnership in 1964 with the municipalities Schnals and Naturns in Italy. The Speyer district had a partnership with Schlanders and Martell, also in Italy, which were taken over after the merging of the district. As part of the partnership of Rhineland-Palatinate with Rwanda the district has a partnership with the municipality of Kinyami starting in 1983. After the German reunification the district supported the Saalkreis in Saxony-Anhalt in modernising the administration to western standard, which resulted in a friendship between the two districts. In 1991 a partnership with the district Radviliskis in Lithuania was started, and in 2002 with the Polish district Opole in Silesia.

==Geography==
The district is located in the valley of the Rhine river, both the actual river valley and the &quot;Vorderpfälzer Tiefland&quot;, formed by the sediments of the rivers of the Palatinate hills. The district has a very warm climate, together with the fertile loess soil it makes the area favourable for growing vegetable. However the rainfall is comparatively low, thus irrigation is needed.

==Coat of arms==
The wavy line from the bottom-right to the top-left symbolizes the Rhine river.

The lion in the left is the lion of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to which the largest part of the district belonged historically.

The silver cross in the right part is taken from the State of Speyer, taken from the coat of arms of the Speyer district.

The shield in the middle show water lily leaves, a typical symbol for the district, as this plant grows in the old arms of the Rhine river.

<text>Nicolás Cristóbal Guillén Batista (10 July 1902 – 16 July 1989) was a Cuban poet, journalist and political activist. He is best remembered as the national poet of Cuba.

Born in Camagüey, Cuba, he studied law at the University of Havana, but abandoned a legal career and worked as both a typographer and journalist. His poetry was published in various magazines from the early 1920s; his first collection, &quot;Motivos de son&quot; (1930) was strongly influenced by his meeting that year with the African-American poet, Langston Hughes. He drew from &quot;son&quot; music in his poetry. &quot;West Indies, Ltd.&quot;, published in 1934, was Guillén&#x27;s first collection with political implications. Cuba&#x27;s dictatorial Gerardo Machado regime was overthrown in 1933, but political repression intensified. After being jailed in 1936, Guillén joined the Communist Party the next year, traveling to Spain for a Congress of Writers and Artists, and covering the Spanish Civil War as a magazine reporter.

After returning to Cuba, he stood as a Communist in the local elections of 1940. This caused him to be refused a visa to enter the United States the following year, but he traveled widely during the next decades in South America, China and Europe. In 1953, after being in Chile, he was refused re-entry to Cuba and spent five years in exile. He returned after the successful Cuban revolution of 1959. From 1961, he served more than 30 years as president of the &quot;Unión Nacional de Escritores de Cuba,&quot; the National Cuban Writers&#x27; Union. His awards included the Stalin Peace Prize in 1954, the 1976 International Botev Prize, and in 1983 he was the inaugural winner of Cuba&#x27;s National Prize for Literature. His great grandson Manuel de Jesús Guillén Esplugas who protested the Cuban regime during the 11th of July protests was murdered in police custody during his 6 year sentence at 29 years old.

==Early life==
Nicolás Guillén Batista was born July 10, 1902, in Camagüey, Cuba, the eldest of six children (three boys and three girls) of Argelia Batista y Arrieta and Nicolás Guillén y Urra, both of whom were of mixed-race, African-European descent. His father had fought for independence as a lieutenant. When his first son Nicolás was born, the father worked as a journalist for one of the new local papers. He introduced his son to Afro-Cuban music when he was very young. Guillén y Urra belonged to the &quot;Partido Libertad&quot; and founded the daily newspaper, &quot;La Libertad,&quot; to express its views. Government forces assassinated Guillén&#x27;s father for protesting against electoral fraud and destroyed his printing press, where Nicolás and a brother were already working. Argelia and her children struggled financially. Nicolás and his siblings encountered discriminatory racism in Cuba similar to that suffered by African Americans in the United States.

==Literary works==
Guillén drew from his mixed African and Spanish ancestry and education to combine his knowledge of traditional literary form with firsthand experience of the speech, legends, songs, and songs of Afro-Cubans in his first volume of poetry, &quot;Motivos de son.&quot; It was soon acclaimed as a masterpiece and widely imitated. In the 1920s, when Afro-Cuban sounds and instruments were changing the world of Cuban music, Afro-Cuban culture began to be expressed in art and literature as well. Initially, Afro-Cuban poetry, or &quot;&quot;negrista&quot; &quot;poetry, was mainly published by European Cubans such as Emilio Ballagas, Alejo Carpentier, and José Tallet. It was not until the 1930s that Guillén would appeal in literary terms by expressing a personal account of the struggles, dreams, and mannerisms of Afro-Cubans.

Guillén became outspoken politically, and dissatisfied with picturesque portrayal of the daily life of the poor. He began to decry their oppression in his poetry volumes &quot;Sóngoro cosongo&quot; and &quot;West Indies Ltd.&quot; Guillen also wrote &quot;Cantos para soldados y sones para turistas,&quot; which reflected his growing political commitment. Guillén is probably the best-known representative of the &quot;poesía negra&quot; (&quot;black poetry&quot;), which tried to create a synthesis between black and white cultural elements, a &quot;poetic mestizaje&quot;. Characteristic for his poems is the use of onomatopoetic words (&quot;Sóngoro Cosongo&quot;, &quot;Mayombe-bombe&quot;) that try to imitate the sound of drums or the rhythm of the &quot;son&quot;. Silvestre Revueltas&#x27;s symphonic composition &quot;Sensemayá&quot; was based on Guillén&#x27;s poem of the same name, and became that composer&#x27;s best-known work, followed by José Limantour&#x27;s suite from his film score for &quot;La noche de los mayas&quot;.

Guillén later became acknowledged by many critics as the most influential of those Latin American poets who dealt with African themes and re-created African song and dance rhythms in literary form. Guillen made an international mark with the publication of &quot;Motivos de son&quot; (1930). The work was inspired by the living conditions of Afro-Cubans and the popular &quot;son&quot; music. The work consists of eight short poems using the everyday language of the Afro Cubans. The collection stood out in the literary world because it emphasized and established the importance of Afro-Cuban culture as a valid genre in Cuban literature.

In &quot;Man-Making Words: Selected Poems of Nicolás Guillén&quot;, Angel Aguier, in reference to &quot;Motivos de son,&quot; wrote that 
&quot;the &#x27;son,&#x27; a passionate dance born of the Negro-white encounter under Caribbean skies in which the words and music of the people culminate in song, is the basic substance of the elemental poetry which Guillen intuitively felt as the expression of the Cuban spirit... He specifically chose the son as the mixed artistic creation of the two races that make up the Cuban population; for the son, in form and content, runs the full gamut of every aspect of our national character.&quot; This quote establishes how the &quot;son&quot;, such a profound musical genre of that time, initiated the fusion of black and white Cuban culture. Guillén&#x27;s incorporation of the genre into his writings, symbolized and created a pathway for the same cultural fusion in Cuban literature.

Guillén&#x27;s unique approach of using the &quot;son&quot; in his poetry is expressed in his book &quot;Sóngoro consongo&quot; (1931). In this work, he included poems that depicted the lives of Cubans and emphasized the importance of Afro-Cuban culture in Cuban history. &quot;Sóngoro consongo&quot; captures the essence of the Afro-Cuban culture and ways that the people deal with their personal situations.

Guillén&#x27;s poem, &quot;Motivos de son&quot;, from &quot;Sóngoro consongo&quot;, is a fusion of West African and Hispanic literary styles, contributing to his unique literary vision.

&quot;La canción del bongó&quot;, like many poems in &quot;Sóngoro consongo&quot;, incorporates the rhythmic sounds of son. The poem has a rhythm that uses the marking of stressed and unstressed syllables in strong and weak beats, rather than simply the number of syllables. Dellita L. Martin says that &quot;La canción del bongó&quot; stands out as a poem because &quot;it is the only one to indicate Guillén&#x27;s painfully increasing awareness of racial conflicts in Cuba&quot;.

==Langston Hughes and Nicolás Guillén==
In 1930, José Antonio Fernández de Castro, publisher of the Havana daily paper, &quot;Diario de la Marina&quot;, and the first to translate American Langston Hughes’s poetry to Spanish, arranged for the two poets to meet. He was a white Cuban from an aristocratic family who loved black Cuba. He was a newspaperman, a diplomat, and a friend to Cuba’s artists.

In February 1930, Langston Hughes traveled to Cuba for the second time, on a two-week mission to find a black composer to collaborate on a folk opera. He had been given a letter of introduction to José Antonio Fernández de Castro, his door to Cuba’s artistic world. At this time Hughes’ poetry was better known to Cubans than that of Guillén, so the American&#x27;s arrival created a stir in the artistic community. The next month, on 9 March 1930, Guillén published “Conversación con Langston Hughes”, an article describing his experience of meeting Hughes in Havana. The Cubans expected a nearly white, tall and heavyset man in his forties with thin lips and an even thinner English-style mustache. Instead they saw a twenty-seven-year-old, slight brown man without a mustache. Guillén wrote that Mr. Hughes &quot;parece justamente un mulatico cubano”&quot; – looks just like a Cuban mulatto.

Guillén was especially taken with Hughes&#x27; warm personality and enthusiasm for the &quot;son&quot;&quot; music, which he heard on the nightly forays into Cuba&#x27;s Marinao district organized by Fernandez de Castro. Hughes was said to be a hit with the &quot;soneros.&quot; His enthusiasm for Cuban music inspired Guillén. Hughes immediately saw the similarities between &quot;son&quot; and the blues, as folk music traditions whose form was based on the call-and-response structure of African music. Additionally, he was excited about its possibilities as an organic base for formal poetry. According to biographer Arnold Rampersad, Hughes suggested to Guillén that he make the rhythms of the &quot;son&quot; central to his poetry, as the American had used elements of blues and jazz.

Hughes drew not only rhythmic innovation from these folk music traditions, but used them as a means to express his protest against racial inequality. Both poets shared anger against racism, but Hughes impressed Guillén with his particular kind of racial consciousness. Although the Cuban poet had expressed outrage against racism and economic imperialism, he had not yet done so in language inspired by Afro-Cuban speech, song, and dance. He had been more concerned with protest than with celebrating the power and beauty of Afro Cubans.

Within weeks of meeting Hughes, Guillén quickly wrote eight poems that were markedly different from his previous work. His new poems generated controversy and established Guillén&#x27;s fame as one of the premier poets of the Négritude movement, which spanned the Americas. On 21 April 1930, Guillén sent Hughes the result of his inspiration, his book of poetry &quot;Motivos de Son.&quot; The author wrote on the inside cover, “Al poeta Langston Hughes, querido amigo mío. Afectuosamente, Nicolás Guillén”. Although Hughes did not find an Afro-Cuban composer to work with, he created a lasting friendship with Guillén; it was based on their mutual respect and convictions about racial inequality.

==Poetry and politics==
Cuba&#x27;s dictatorial Gerardo Machado regime was overthrown in 1933, but political repression in the following years intensified. In 1936, with other editors of &quot;Mediodía&quot;, Guillén was arrested on trumped-up charges, and spent some time in jail. In 1937 he joined the Communist Party and made his first trip abroad in July 1937 to attend the Second International Writers&#x27; Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war in Spain, held in Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid and attended by many writers including André Malraux, Ernest Hemingway, Stephen Spender and Pablo Neruda. During his travels in the country, he covered Spain&#x27;s Civil War as a magazine reporter.

Guillén returned to Cuba via Guadeloupe. He stood as a Communist in the local elections of 1940. The following year he was refused a visa to enter the United States, but he travelled widely during the next two decades in South America, China and Europe.

Guillén&#x27;s poetry was increasingly becoming imbued with issues of cross-cultural Marxist dialectic. In 1953, he was prevented by the Fulgencio Batista government from re-entering Cuba after a trip to Chile and had to spend five years in exile.

After the Cuban revolution of 1959, Guillen was welcomed back by Fidel Castro, the new president. In 1961 he was appointed as president of the &quot;Unión Nacional de Escritores de Cuba,&quot; the National Cuban Writers&#x27; Union, serving for more than 25 years. He continued to write evocative and poignant poetry highlighting social conditions, such as &quot;Problemas de Subdesarrollo&quot; and &quot;Dos Niños&quot; (Two Children). He was considered the national poet of Cuba, who drew from its multicultural history and population for inspiration.

Nicolás Guillén died in 1989, aged 87, of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was buried in the Colon Cemetery, Havana.

<doc id="222875" wikidata="Q8002298" url="?curid=222875" title="Wilhelm Schroeder">
<text>Wilhelm Schroeder (April 23 1898 – July 8 1943) was a German agricultural estate manager, a Nazi Party politician and an SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot;. He served as a deputy in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from 1933 until his death. As an officer in the Waffen-SS, he was killed in action in the Second World War.

== Early life ==
Schroeder was born in Leipzig and attended the local &quot;Volksschule&quot;. From October 1914, he took part in the First World War, first with the 19th (2nd Royal Saxon) Hussars and, from October 1917, as a pilot with Aviation Detachment A 256. From 1916, he held the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot; of reserves. During the war, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd class. After returning to civilian life, he attended a &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Dresden from 1919 to 1920, where he obtained his &quot;Abitur&quot;. He completed an agricultural apprenticeship from 1920 to 1921 and then spent a year studying agriculture, economics, history and art at the University of Munich. From 1923 to 1932, Schroeder earned his living as an estate manager, and he married in 1927.

== Career in the Nazi Party ==
In January 1923, Schroeder joined the Nazi Party (membership number 63,277), after having been associated with it since 1922. As an early Party member, he later would be awarded the Golden Party Badge. He also became a member of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), the Party&#x27;s paramilitary organization. After the Party was temporarily banned from November 1923 to January 1925, he rejoined it in 1926. In the following years, he held various party posts, from 1930 as a party speaker, an &quot;Ortsgruppenleiter&quot; (local group leader) and a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) expert agricultural advisor. In 1932, he also assumed the leadership of SA-&quot;Standarte&quot; 139 with the rank of SA-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot;.

In the parliamentary election of July 1932, Schroeder was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; for electoral constituency 29 (Leipzig). Among the parliamentary votes in which Schroeder participated was the passage of the Enabling Act in March 1933. He would retain his seat in the national parliament until his death, switching to constituency 22 (Düsseldorf East) in the election of March 1936, and to constituency 34 (Hamburg) in April 1938.

After the Nazi seizure of power at the end of January 1933, Schroeder was promoted to SA-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;. In 1934, he became a member of the State Farmers&#x27; Council of Saxony. On February 12, 1935, he joined the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; (membership number 261,293) as an SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;. From May 6, 1935, to January 15, 1937, he led the 20th SS-Standarte in Düsseldorf. From January 1, 1937, to May 20, 1939, Schroeder was the leader of SS-&quot;Abschnitt&quot; (district) XV, headquartered in Altona. On November 9, 1937, he was promoted to SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot;. On June 1, 1939, he was appointed the first chief of staff of SS-&quot;Oberabschnitt&quot; (main district) &quot;Alpenland&quot; in Salzburg, a post he would retain until his death.

== Wartime service and death ==
After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Schroeder returned to military service as a &quot;Leutnant&quot; of reserves with the German Army and was promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; the next year. In 1943, he transferred to the Waffen-SS with the rank of SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; of reserves.

Schroeder was killed in action on July 8, 1943. However, there is a discrepancy as to the circumstances of his death. Two sources indicate that Schroeder died in July 1943 during an anti-partisan operation in Carinthia. Another document (letter of condolence from his commander F. Bochmann, dated July 15, 1943) states that on July 8, 1943, Schroeder &quot;remained in front of the enemy west of the village of Gouki as the head of the heavy tank company of our regiment.&quot; A newspaper clipping also refers to the fact that Schroeder &quot;fell as an SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; and company commander in the SS Panzer Grenadier Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot; during the current heavy fighting in the East&quot;.

Schroeder was a holder of the in gold, the SS Honor Sword and the SS Honor Ring.

<text>The pint (, ; symbol pt, sometimes abbreviated as &quot;p&quot;) is a unit of volume or capacity in both the imperial and United States customary measurement systems. In both of those systems, it is one-eighth of a gallon. 

The British imperial pint is 20.095% larger than the US pint because the two systems are defined differently. Almost all other countries have standardized on the metric system, so although some of them still also have traditional units called pints (such as for beverages), the volume varies by regional custom.

The imperial pint (≈) is used in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and other Commonwealth countries. In the United States, two kinds of pint are used: a liquid pint (≈) and a less common dry pint (≈). 

Other former British colonies, such as Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, converted to the metric system in the 1960s and 1970s, so while the term may still be in common use in these countries, it may no longer refer to the British imperial pint once used throughout the British Empire.

==Name==

&quot;Pint&quot; comes from the Old French word and perhaps ultimately from Vulgar Latin meaning &quot;painted&quot;, for marks painted on the side of a container to show capacity. It is linguistically related, though greatly diverging in meaning, to Pinto – an Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese name for a person with a speckled or dark complexion, often used as a surname in these languages.

In France, the French word is now used to describe a half-litre, slightly smaller than an Imperial pint, but in Canadian French it is used to describe an Imperial quart and the French word is used for an Imperial pint.

==Definitions==
===Imperial pint===
:The imperial pint is equal to one-eighth of an imperial gallon of exactly , i.e. . 

===US liquid pint===

In the United States, traditional length and volume measures have been legally standardized for commerce by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, using the definition of 1 yard as 0.9144 meters: from this definition, the metric equivalents for inches, feet, miles, area measures, and measures of volume are determined. 

The liquid pint is legally defined as one-eighth of a gallon of exactly 231 cubic inches, i.e. 28.875 cubic inches or .
::

===US dry pint===
In the United States, the dry pint is equal to of a US bushel of exactly 2150.42 cubic inches, i.e. 33.6003125 cubic inches or .

===Other pints===

A now-obsolete unit of measurement in Scotland, known as the &quot;Scottish pint&quot;, or , is equal to 1696 mL (2 pints 19.69 imp fl oz). It remained in use until the 19th century, surviving significantly longer than most of the old Scottish measurements.

The word &quot;pint&quot; is one of numerous false friends between English and French. They are not the same unit although they have the same linguistic origin. The French word is etymologically related, but historically described a larger unit. The Royal pint () was 48 French cubic inches (952.1 mL), but regional pints varied in size depending on locality and on commodity (usually wine or olive oil) varying from 0.95 L to over 2 L.

In Canada, the &quot;Weights and Measures Act&quot; (R.S. 1985) defines a pint in English as one eighth of a gallon, but defines a in French as one quarter of a gallon. Thus, if &quot;a pint of beer&quot; is ordered in English, servers are legally required to serve an imperial pint (568 mL) of beer, but under the federal &quot;Act&quot;, &quot;&quot; legally refers to the larger imperial quart (1136 mL), while an imperial pint is designated as . However, in practice and according to Quebec’s Board of the French Language, commonly refers to the same 568 mL imperial pint as in English.

In Flanders, the word , meaning &#x27;little pint&#x27;, refers only to a 250 mL glass of lager. Some West- and East-Flemish dialects use it as a word for beaker. The equivalent word in German, , refers to a glass of a third of a litre in Cologne and the Rhineland.

In South Australia, ordering &quot;a pint of beer&quot; results in 425 mL (15 fl oz) being served. Customers must specifically request &quot;an Imperial pint of beer&quot; to get 570 mL (20 fl oz). Australians from other states often contest the size of their beers in Adelaide.

==Equivalence==
One US liquid pint of water weighs , which gives rise to a popular saying: &quot;A pint&#x27;s a pound the world around&quot;.

However, the statement does not hold around the world, because the British imperial pint, which was also the standard measure in Britain&#x27;s former colonies - such as Ireland, Canada, Australia, India, Malaysia, New Zealand and South Africa - weighs . This prompted the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge to coin a saying for use in Commonwealth countries: &quot;a pint of pure water weighs a pound and a quarter&quot;.

==History==
The pint is traditionally one eighth of a gallon. In the Latin of the apothecaries&#x27; system, the symbol &quot;O&quot; ( or ; plural or – reflecting the &quot;eighth&quot; concept in its syllable) was used for the pint. Because of the many historical definitions of a gallon, there have been many definitions of the pint.

Britain&#x27;s North American colonies adopted the British wine gallon, defined in 1707 as exactly 231 cubic inches (3 in × 7 in × 11 in) as their basic liquid measure, from which the US wet pint is derived, and the British corn gallon ( of a standard &quot;Winchester&quot; bushel of corn, or exactly 268.8025 cubic inches) as its dry measure, from which the US dry pint is derived.

In 1824, the British parliament replaced all the various gallons with a new imperial gallon based on ten pounds of distilled water at (≈277.4194 cubic inches), from which the current imperial pint is derived.

The various Canadian provinces continued to use the wine gallon as a basis for their pint until 1873, well after Britain adopted the imperial system in 1824, while the traditional French used in Lower Canada (Quebec) was twice the size of the traditional English pint used in Upper Canada (Ontario). After four of the British provinces united in the Canadian Confederation in 1867, Canada legally adopted the British imperial system of measure in 1873.

In 1873, the French Canadian was defined as being one imperial quart or two imperial pints, while the imperial pint was legally called a in French Canada. While the imperial pint, quart, and gallon are still legal units of measure in Canada, they are 20.095% larger than their American counterparts.

Historically, units called a pint (or the equivalent in the local language) were used across much of Europe, with values varying between countries from less than half a litre to over one litre. Within continental Europe, these pints were replaced with liquid measures based on the metric system during the 19th century. The term is still in limited use in parts of France and Central Europe, notably some areas of Germany and Switzerland, where is colloquially used for half a litre. In Spanish holiday resorts frequented by British tourists, &#x27;pint&#x27; is often taken to mean a beer glass (especially a dimple mug). Half-pint 285 mL, and pint mugs, 570 mL, may therefore be referred to as (&#x27;half jar/jug&#x27;) and (&#x27;large jar/jug&#x27;).

===Effects of metrication===

In the British and Irish metrication processes, the pint was replaced by metric units as the legally defined primary unit of measure for trading by volume or capacity, except for the sale of draught beer and cider, and milk in returnable containers. As a supplementary unit, the pint can still be used in those countries in all circumstances. UK legislation mandates that draught beer and cider must be sold in one-third of a pint, two-thirds of a pint, or multiples of half a pint, which must be served in stamped, measured glasses or from government-stamped meters. Milk, in returnable containers, may come in pints without the metric equivalent stated. However, all other goods apart from the aforementioned exceptions must be sold or labelled in metric units. Milk in plastic containers mostly comes in multiples of 1 pint, but they are required to display the metric equivalent on packaging. Filtered milk and UHT milk sold in the UK is commonly sold in multiples of 1 litre bottles or containers. 
 Recipes published in the UK and Ireland would have given ingredient quantities in imperial, where the pint is used as a unit for larger liquid quantities, as well as the metric measure - though recipes written now are more likely to use metric units.

In Australia and New Zealand, a subtle change was made to 1 pint milk bottles during the conversion from imperial to metric in the 1970s: the height and diameter of the milk bottle remained unchanged, so that existing equipment for handling and storing the bottles was unaffected, but the shape was adjusted to increase the capacity from 568 mL to 600 mL, a conveniently rounded metric measure. Such milk bottles are no longer officially referred to as pints. However, the &quot;pint glass&quot; in pubs in Australia remains closer to the standard imperial pint, at 570 mL. It holds about 500 mL of beer and about 70 mL of froth, except in South Australia, where a pint is served in a 425 mL glass and a 570 mL glass is called an &quot;imperial pint&quot;.

In New Zealand, there is no longer any legal requirement for beer to be served in standard measures: in pubs, the largest size of glass, which is referred to as a pint, varies, but usually contains 425 mL.

After metrication in Canada, milk and other liquids in pre-packaged containers came in metric sizes so conversion issues could no longer arise. Draft beer in Canada, when advertised as a &quot;pint&quot;, is legally required to be an imperial pint (568 mL). With the allowed margin of error of 0.5 fluid ounces, a &quot;pint&quot; that is less than 554 mL of beer is an offence, though this regulation is often violated and rarely enforced. To avoid legal issues, many drinking establishments are moving away from using the term &quot;pint&quot; and are selling &quot;glasses&quot; or &quot;sleeves&quot; of beer, neither of which have a legal definition.

A 375 mL bottle of liquor in the US and the Canadian maritime provinces is sometimes referred to as a &quot;pint&quot; and a 200 mL bottle is called a &quot;half-pint&quot;, harking back to the days when liquor came in US pints, fifths, quarts, and half-gallons. Liquor in the US has been sold in metric sized bottles since 1980, although beer is still sold in US traditional units.

In France, a standard 250 mL measure of beer is known as (&quot;a half&quot;), originally meaning a half-pint.

<text>Wilhelm Anton &quot;Bill&quot; Leeb (born 21 September 1966, in Vienna, Austria) is an Austrian-Canadian electronic musician and record producer. He is best known for being a founding member of the industrial music group Front Line Assembly and Delerium. Additionally, Leeb is known for his work with groups Noise Unit, Intermix, Skinny Puppy, Synæsthesia, Cyberaktif, Equinox, Fauxliage and Pro&gt;Tech.

==Career==
Leeb began his musical career with industrial band Skinny Puppy in 1984 under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder, contributing bass synth and occasional backing vocals to a few of their recordings and concerts. He left in 1986 and formed his own industrial project Front Line Assembly with Michael Balch, and later Rhys Fulber and Chris Peterson. Though Front Line Assembly has had consistent underground success, Leeb&#x27;s most widely known efforts are through his side project Delerium, which had a major hit in the late 1990s with &quot;Silence&quot;. Leeb composed the soundtrack to the 1999 video game, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, of which the expansion pack, &quot;Team Arena&quot;, was composed by his band, Front Line Assembly.

In 2017, Leeb appeared as guest singer on the single &quot;A Shiver of Want&quot;, a release of John Fryer&#x27;s project Black Needle Noise.

In 2022, Leeb contributed vocals for Black Asteroid&#x27;s single &quot;Methane Rain&quot;.

In June 2024, American label Metropolis announced Leeb&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Model Kollapse&quot;, to be released on September 13, 2024. The first single &quot;Terror Forms&quot; was released on July 9 along with a video. Metropolis released the second single &quot;Demons&quot; on August 9, 2024, that was also accompanied by a video. Leeb explained that the idea of a solo album was suggested by Metropolis founder Dave Heckman, who passed away before the album&#x27;s release.

===Dispute with Trent Reznor===
In an interview with music magazine &quot;Spin&quot; in 1992, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails made derogatory remarks about Front Line Assembly, calling them &quot;a textbook case of a band&quot; for industrial music and their music &quot;monotonous, boring, uninspired bullshit&quot;. Before the release of the issue, Reznor sent Leeb an apology letter. In one of their following issues, &quot;Spin&quot; printed part of the apology, in which Reznor expressed that he &quot;should have thought before opening [his] mouth&quot;, along with a response from Leeb in which he implores Reznor to &quot;think before making such ludicrous statements&quot; and that he hopes &quot;that others will use a little more thought before they go out of their way to put others down&quot;.

===Acting===
In 1990, Leeb appeared in the trailer for the horror movie &quot;Chunk Blower&quot; together with Dwayne Goettel from Skinny Puppy, playing one of the victims of a killer. Due to the lack of funding, the movie was never made. Director Jim Van Bebber and Leeb would later use footage from the trailer in the video for the single &quot;Virus&quot;.

==Personal life==
Leeb has both Austrian and Canadian citizenship and speaks English as well as German. He received education at a convent school in Austria where he learned to play the violin. He moved to Kitimat, British Columbia, Canada with his family when he was 14, where he learned English and developed a keen interest in music. He was a high school student at Mount Elizabeth Secondary School. Leeb went to Camsoun College in Victoria, British Columbia to study journalism for two years. He lives in Vancouver.

Leeb was married to the Canadian artist Carylann Loeppky. Loeppky was part of the tour personnel on Front Line Assembly tours &quot;designing and selling merchandise and put together a visual presentation for the live performance.&quot; She continued to create artwork for albums of Delerium.

<text>Abercrombie (May 13, 1975 – November 14, 2000) was a bay Standardbred world-record-holding pacer and winner of the E. Roland Harriman Award for Harness Horse of the Year in 1978, who went on to become one of the sport&#x27;s leading sires.

==Bloodlines==
By Silent Majority out of Bergdorf by Duane Hanover, he was sold at the Tattersalls auction for $9,500 to Keith Bulen and Shirley Mitchell. Abercrombie&#x27;s dam, Bergdorf, was a leading broodmare; although he was her fastest foal, 10 of her 12 foals made it to the races.

==Racing career==
Jerry Landess was his first trainer, and Cecil Peacock, a full-time school bus driver, succeeded Landess as Abercrombie&#x27;s trainer for his two-year-old season. When his talent became apparent he was turned over to Glen Garnsey, his trainer-driver. In 20 starts as a two-year-old Abercrombie won seven times and finished second and third three times each, earning $49,379; his fastest time that season was 1:56 at The Red Mile.

Abercrombie won 22 of his 33 races in 1978, including the Messenger Stakes, the Prix d&#x27;Été, and the Adios Stakes, and earned $703,260. His best time for the mile was 1:53 (then a world record which stood for three years), set as a 4-year-old in August 1979 at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

==At stud==
Abercrombie retired in 1979 to become an important sire at Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky (where he was syndicated for $3 million), helping to return the Adios line to prominence. As of May 2004, his offspring have won over $149 million. Abercrombie sired more than 1,700 foals; 11 of his offspring earned more than $1 million each (including Artsplace, Harness Horse of the Year in 1992, who earned $3,085,083), and 432 have earned over $100,000. Among Abercrombie&#x27;s other well-known progeny are Life Sign, Armbro Emerson, Anniecrombie, Missisippin, Misfit, Kentucky Spur, Goliath Bayama, Dontgetinmyway, Albert Albert and Armbro Dallas. His descendants have been successful both on the track and in the breeding shed; of his 1,574 offspring who have raced, 1,120 have paced below 2:00 and 403 have taken marks below 1:55.

Abercrombie was inducted into the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1999. He died the following year, and is buried at the Castleton Farm horse cemetery.

<doc id="222889" wikidata="Q128725" url="?curid=222889" title="Hidetoshi Nakata">
<text>is a Japanese former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Considered one of the best talents to come from an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) country in the early late 1990s and early 2000s, Nakata became the first ever AFC player to be nominated for the Ballon d&#x27;Or. 

Nakata began his professional career in 1995 and won the Asian Football Confederation Player of the Year award in 1997 and 1998, the Scudetto with Roma in 2001, played for Japan in three World Cup tournaments (1998, 2002 and 2006) and competed in the Olympics twice (1996 and 2000). In 2005, he was made the Knight of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity, one of Italy&#x27;s highest honors, for improving the country&#x27;s image overseas. Nakata has also been involved in fashion, regularly attending runway shows and wearing designer clothing.

Nakata announced his retirement at the age of 29 on 3 July 2006, after a ten-year career that included seven seasons in the Italian Serie A and a season in the English Premier League. In March 2004, Pelé named Nakata in his FIFA 100, a list of the top living footballers at the time. Nakata was one of only two Asian footballers on the list.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Nakata began his professional career at the age of 18 in 1995, with J1 League side Bellmare Hiratsuka (now Shonan Bellmare). He played many matches as an attacking midfielder from his first season and the club won the 1995 Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the first Asian title in the club&#x27;s history. In the final against Al-Talaba, he scored the winning goal in the 81st minute. From 1996, he became a regular player and he was selected for the J.League Best XI in 1997. After the 1998 World Cup in France, Nakata was signed by Perugia in Italy&#x27;s Serie A for 4 million U.S. dollars, becoming the second Japanese player ever to appear in the Italian top league after Kazuyoshi Miura had done it for Genoa four years earlier. In his first season in Italy, Nakata scored 10 goals, his single-season highest total.

===Roma===
In January 2000, after one and a half seasons at Perugia, Nakata moved to Roma for 42 billion lire, helping the team win the scudetto. The highlight of Nakata&#x27;s career at Roma came on 6 May 2001 in a Serie A match against Juventus at Stadio Delle Alpi. After replacing Francesco Totti in the second half with Roma trailing 0–2, Nakata netted with a 30-yard goal beyond Juventus goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar&#x27;s reach, with 11 minutes left in the match. He then helped Roma score the equalizer when his fierce drive from outside the box was parried by Van der Sar into the path of Vincenzo Montella, who scored for Roma in the last minute. The match ended with a 2–2 draw and Roma maintained a six-point margin at the top of the league table.

===Parma===
In the summer of 2001, Nakata penned a four-year deal with Parma for a transfer fee of 55 billion lire, a world record payment for an Asian player which would not be broken for 14 years. He made his club debut on 8 August 2001 in their 0–2 defeat at Stadio Ennio Tardini against Lille in the first leg of the third round of the Champions League. More than one month later, on 23 September, Nakata scored his first goal for Parma in Serie A at home over Brescia, which also proved to be the winning goal of the match. Nakata played there for two and a half seasons, where he scored a crucial goal after coming on as a substitute in the first leg of the 2002 Coppa Italia final against Juventus, which Parma eventually won.

===Later years===
In January 2004, Nakata played for Bologna where he played the remainder of the 2003–04 season before moving to Fiorentina, where he played the following season. In August 2005, Nakata moved to Premiership side Bolton Wanderers on loan. During his season at Bolton, which would be the last of his professional career, he scored once in the league, in a 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion.

==International career==

After having represented U-17 Japan at the 1993 U-17 World Championship (where he scored a goal) and U-20 Japan at the 1995 U-20 World Championship (where he scored twice), Nakata was part of the U-23 Japan squads at the 1996 Olympics, where Japan upset Brazil, and at the 2000 Olympics. His senior national team debut came in May 1997 against South Korea.

He was a key member of the Japanese side that qualified for the 1998 World Cup, scoring five goals in qualification matches and setting up all three Japanese goals in the qualification play-off against Iran. He helped Japan reach the final of the 2001 Confederations Cup but left the national team before the final to join Roma for their final league matches. Nakata played in all four of Japan&#x27;s matches at the 2002 World Cup, co-hosted by South Korea and Japan, scoring the second goal of a 2–0 first round win against Tunisia.

At the 2006 World Cup, Nakata played in all three matches for Japan, losing to Australia and Brazil, and drawing with Croatia. His performance against Croatia earned him a Man of the Match award. After the 2006 FIFA World Cup, on 3 July 2006, Nakata announced his retirement from professional football and the Japanese national team on his personal website &quot;I decided half a year ago that I would retire from the world of professional football ... after the World Cup in Germany.&quot; Nakata wrote, &quot;I will never again stand on the pitch as a professional player. But I will never give up football.&quot; In a 2014 interview in &quot;TMW Magazine&quot;, Nakata confirmed that he had retired at such a young age because he was no longer enjoying football, and wanted instead to see what was going on in the world.

Despite Nakata playing every match in Japan&#x27;s first three World Cup appearances, he was not selected for the country&#x27;s Asian Cup-winning squads in 2000 and 2004. In total, he was capped 77 times for Japan, scoring 11 goals, 9 of which came in official FIFA competitions.

==Style of play==
A quick, creative, and hard-working attacking or central midfielder, with an eye for goal, Nakata was known for his technical ability, agility, vision, passing, and his ability to make attacking runs into the penalty area and score goals; he also possessed a powerful shot from outside the box.

==Outside football==
Outside football, Nakata has shown interest in fashion, attending runway shows, wearing designer clothing and sporting colorful haircuts. He dyed his hair blond for the 1998 World Cup, hoping to attract the attention of European scouts. Japanese hairstylist Aki Watanabe credits him as a trendsetter. Andrea Tenerani, photographer for &quot;GQ&quot; in Italy said of Nakata, &quot;He&#x27;s perfect; he&#x27;s like a model. And he&#x27;s totally obsessed with fashion.&quot; Calvin Klein designer Italo Zucchelli said, &quot;(Nakata) plays with fashion like all of them now, but in a cooler, more sophisticated way than many others.&quot; He is one of the models featuring the Calvin Klein underwear campaign 2010. He was featured in the July 2007 US version of &quot;GQ&quot; with a 12-page spread on fall fashion. He was featured in &quot;GQ&quot; in his home country in December 2011.

Often regarded as a Japanese David Beckham, Nakata is an editor-at-large at &quot;Monocle&quot; magazine at the invitation of his friend Tyler Brûlé, who serves as the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief. Nakata has cited the popular manga and anime series, &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot;, as his primary inspiration in choosing football as a career. In recent years, he has also been an active supporter of Special Olympics football and participated in the 2010 Special Olympics Unity Cup in South Africa during the World Cup. Nakata was named a Global Ambassador for Special Olympics in 2014.

Towards the end of 2015, Nakata entered into a partnership with Kee Club in Hong Kong to open Koko, a Hong Kong-based restaurant that serves sakes created by Nakata himself. He has developed his own line of sake as well as creating his own mobile educational app, &quot;Sakenomy&quot;. Expressing interest in educating the public about sake, Nakata stated, &quot;People recognise brands of wine but not usually brands of sake. There is a lack of information and branding when it comes to sake. That’s why I thought I needed to create a brand that people can recognise and understand. My purpose is to expand the market for all sake not just my own. You can pair any type of cuisine with sake. It can go with French, Italian, even Chinese food, not just Japanese cuisine.&quot;

===Media===
Having been signed to sportswear company Nike, Nakata featured in Nike&#x27;s &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; advertisement (branded &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, in the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan. He appeared alongside other star football players from around the world, including Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo, Thierry Henry, Roberto Carlos and Francesco Totti, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;. Nakata featured on the front cover of various Japanese editions of EA Sports’ &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series, including &quot;FIFA Football 2002&quot;. In 2018, Nakata was added as an icon to the Ultimate Team in &quot;FIFA 19&quot;.
In the 2012 video game &quot;Inazuma Eleven 2: Firestorm / Blizzard&quot; Nakata was added as a hidden playable player. He then served an important story role in &quot;Inazuma Eleven 3&quot; and its respective anime series, where Nakata would serve as the captain of the Italian team Orpheus.

<text>Mathieu, comte Dumas (; 23 November 1753 – 16 October 1837) was a French general.

==Biography==
Born in Montpellier, France, of a noble family, he joined the French army in 1773 and entered upon active service in 1780, as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Rochambeau in the American Revolutionary War. He had a share in all the principal engagements that occurred during a period of nearly two years. On the conclusion of peace in 1783 he returned to France as a major.

During 1784 to 1786 Dumas explored the archipelago and the coasts of Turkey. He was present at the siege of Amsterdam in 1787, where he co-operated with the Dutch against the Prussians.

After the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789) he acted with Lafayette and the constitutional liberal party. The National Constituent Assembly entrusted him with the command of the escort which conducted King Louis XVI to Paris after the Flight to Varennes (June 1791). In 1791 as a maréchal de camp he was appointed to a command at Metz, where he rendered important service in improving the discipline of the troops.

Chosen a member of the Legislative Assembly in the same year by the &quot;département&quot; of Seine-et-Oise, he was in 1792 elected president of the Assembly. When the extreme republicans gained the ascendancy, however, he judged it prudent to make his escape to England. Returning after a brief interval, under the apprehension that his father-in-law would be held responsible for his absence, he arrived in Paris in the midst of the Reign of Terror, and had to flee to Switzerland.

Soon after his return to France he was elected a member of the Council of Ancients in the period of the Directory. After the coup of the 18th Fructidor (4 September 1797) Dumas, being proscribed as a monarchist, made his escape to Holstein, where he wrote the first part of his &quot;Précis des événements militaires&quot; (published anonymously at Hamburg, 1800).

Recalled to his native country when Bonaparte became First Consul (1799), Dumas took over the organisation of the &quot;Army of Reserve&quot; at Dijon. In 1805 he was nominated a councillor of state. He did good service at the Battle of Austerlitz (2 December 1805), and went in 1806 to Naples, where he became minister of war to Joseph Bonaparte.

On the transfer of Joseph to the throne of Spain (1808), Dumas rejoined the French army, with which he served in Spain during the campaign of 1808, and in Germany during that of 1809. After the Battle of Wagram (5–6 July 1809), Dumas participated in negotiating the armistice with Austria.

In 1810 he became grand officer of the Legion of Honour and a count of the Empire. In the Russian campaign of 1812 he held the post of intendant-general of the army, which involved the charge of the administrative department. The privations he suffered in the retreat from Moscow brought on a dangerous illness. Resuming, on his recovery, his duties as intendant-general, he took part in the battles of 1813, and was made prisoner after the capitulation of Dresden.

On the accession of Louis XVIII (1814), Dumas rendered his new sovereign important services in connection with the administration of the army. When Napoleon Bonaparte returned from Elba in the Hundred Days (1815), Dumas at first kept himself in retirement, but Joseph Bonaparte persuaded him to present himself to the Emperor, who employed him in organising the National Guard.

Obliged to retire after the restoration of Louis XVIII (1815), Dumas devoted his leisure to the continuation of his &quot;Précis des événements militaires&quot;, of which nineteen volumes, embracing the history of the war from 1798 to the peace of 1807, appeared between 1817 and 1826. A growing weakness of sight, ending in blindness, prevented him from carrying the work further, but he translated Napier&#x27;s &quot;Peninsular War&quot; as a sort of continuation to it.

In 1818 Dumas returned to favour and became a member of the council of state, from which, however, he was excluded in 1822. After the July Revolution of 1830, in which he took an active part, Dumas was created a peer of France, and re-entered the council of state. He died in Paris on 16 October 1837.

Besides the &quot;Précis des événements militaires&quot;, which forms a valuable source for the history of the period, Dumas wrote &quot;Souvenirs du lieutenant-général Comte Mathieu Dumas&quot; (published posthumously by his son, Paris, 1839).

<text>The long-tailed planigale (Planigale ingrami), also known as Ingram&#x27;s planigale or the northern planigale, is the smallest of all marsupials, and one of the smallest of all mammals. It is rarely seen but is a quite common inhabitant of the blacksoil plains, clay-soiled woodlands, and seasonally flooded grasslands of Australia&#x27;s Top End.

==Taxonomy==

The long-tailed planigale was described in 1906 by Oldfield Thomas, who placed it in the genus &quot;Phascogale&quot;. The species was moved in 1928 by Ellis Le Geyt Troughton, who created the genus &quot;Planigale&quot; for it and the other then-known species, the common planigale (&quot;P. maculata&quot;), and described the narrow-nosed planigale (&quot;P. tenuirostris&quot;). The species has since suffered some taxonomic confusion, having been referred to as &quot;Planigale subtilissima&quot;; there has also been some confusion concerning subspecies. Currently, three subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;P. i. ingrami&quot;, found in the Northern Territory to Townsville, Queensland;
*&quot;P. i. brunnea&quot;, found in the Richmond area of Queensland;
*&quot;P. i. subtilissima&quot;, found in the Ord Victoria Plain and the Kimberley region of Western Australia.

==Description==

The long-tailed planigale has an extraordinary head shape. All planigales have a flattened head, much broader than it is deep. This smallest planigale takes skull depth to an extreme: at just from top to bottom, the skull is one-fifth as deep as it is wide. The purpose, it seems, is to allow it to squeeze into the tiniest of soil cracks; to find its prey, perhaps to avoid predators, or more probably for both reasons. The clays and blacksoils of the Top End typically develop deep cracks as they dry after the monsoonal summer rains, which persist right through the eight-month dry season until the wet begins again, usually producing floods that force small creatures like the long-tailed planigale to seek refuge on high ground.

The head shape aside (which in any case is not obvious from all angles), the long-tailed planigale looks rather like a very small mouse with a long, bare tail. The muzzle is pointed, the fur a nondescript and variable brown, the hindlegs a little bigger than the forelegs, allowing it to stand semi-crouched on hindlegs and tail, rather like a tiny squirrel.

Combined head-body length varies from , averaging in both sexes; the tail length is similar. Average male weight is , for females; a really large specimen can reach almost .

==Diet==

Like all members of the Dasyuromorphia, it is carnivorous, living on invertebrates and small vertebrates which they catch by energetic nocturnal hunting through leaf litter and in soil cracks.

By night it is an active and fearless hunter, preying mostly on insects and their larvae, small lizards, and young mammals almost as large as itself. With the larger prey like grasshoppers, an initial pounce is often insufficient and the planigale bites repeatedly until its prey no longer struggles. Usually, it eats only the soft parts, discarding the head and wings.

==Reproduction==

Breeding can take place at any time of year, but mostly during the wet season. Four to eight young are born, sometimes as many as 12 in southern populations; the young spend six weeks in the backward-facing pouch, and then about another six weeks hidden in a grassy nest under bark or other vegetation while the mother forages each night.

==Distribution and habitat==

The long-tailed planigale prefers floodplains and savannah woodlands with cracked clay soils, as well as riparian areas and blacksoil plains. It is found across northern Australia from the Pilbara through the Great Sandy Desert and the Kimberley region in Western Australia to the Barkly Tableland in the Northern Territory and Townsville in Queensland.
