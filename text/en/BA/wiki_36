<text>Domenico Veneziano (c. 1410 – May 15, 1461) was an Italian painter of the early Renaissance, active mostly in Perugia and Tuscany.

Little is known of his birth, though he is thought to have been born in Venice, hence his last name. He then moved to Florence in 1422–23 as a boy, to become a pupil of Gentile da Fabriano. He is said to have worked with Pisanello in Rome around 1423–1430. His work was influenced by the style of Benozzo Gozzoli.

In a letter from him to Piero di Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, dated from Perugia in 1438, where he likewise resided for many years, he mentions his long connection with the fortunes of the Medici family, and begs to be allowed to paint an altarpiece for the head of that house. He was a contemporary with Fra Angelico and Fra Filippo Lippi, since those two artists and himself are known to have valued the frescoes of Buonfigli at Perugia. Between 1439 and 1441 he painted a masterpiece of the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, a round panel which was probably commissioned for the palace of the wealthy Medici family and is now in Berlin.
Another masterpiece is considered to be the Santa Lucia de&#x27; Magnoli Altarpiece (c. 1445–1447), originally in Santa Lucia dei Magnoli, Florence and now in the Uffizi. Painted in tempera on panel, the altarpiece displays such an unusual palette for this period that Vasari wrote that it had been painted in oil. He influenced Andrea Mantegna.

Other important works are the &quot;Madonna del Roseto&quot; in the National Museum of Art of Romania and the &quot;Madonna Berenson&quot; in the Villa I Tatti in Florence, both dating to around 1432–1437.

Vasari alleged that Domenico was murdered by Andrea del Castagno. However, Castagno died c. 1457, four years before Domenico.

He worked at the decorations of the Portinari chapel in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence from 1439–1445, and had as his assistants Piero della Francesca and Bicci di Lorenzo. It is certain that whilst employed there he used linseed oil as his medium, since the hospital books of that date make many allusions to this item in his expenses. His latter days were spent in Florence, where he died on May 15, 1461.

==Predella of the Santa Lucia de&#x27; Magnoli Altarpiece==
The predella included panels with scenes of the saints of the main composition, and a central, double-size &quot;Annunciation&quot;: the &quot;Stigmata of St. Francis&quot; and &quot;John Baptist in the Desert&quot; are currently in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the &quot;Annunciation &quot;and &quot;The Miracle of St. Zenobius&quot; are in the Fitzwilliam Museum of Cambridge, and the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Lucy&quot; is in the Berlin State Museums.

<text>Leo Ornstein (born &quot;Lev Ornshteyn&quot;; ; – February 24, 2002) was an American experimental composer and pianist of the early twentieth century. His performances of works by avant-garde composers and his own innovative and even shocking pieces made him a cause célèbre on both sides of the Atlantic. The bulk of his experimental works were written for piano.

Ornstein was the first important composer to make extensive use of the tone cluster. As a pianist, he was considered a world-class talent. By the mid-1920s, he had walked away from his fame and soon disappeared from popular memory. Though he gave his last public concert before the age of forty, he continued writing music for another half-century and beyond. Largely forgotten for decades, he was rediscovered in the mid-1970s. Ornstein completed his eighth and final piano sonata in September 1990 at the age of ninety-four, making him the oldest published composer in history at the time (a mark since passed by Elliott Carter).

==Early life==
Ornstein was born in Kremenchug, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire (today part of Ukraine). He grew up in a musical environment—his father was a Jewish cantor (Hazzan), while a violinist uncle encouraged the young boy&#x27;s studies. Ornstein was recognized early on as a prodigy on the piano; in 1902, when the celebrated Polish pianist Josef Hofmann visited Kremenchuk, he heard the six-year-old Ornstein perform. Hofmann gave him a letter of recommendation to the highly regarded Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Soon after, Ornstein was accepted as a pupil at the Imperial School of Music in Kiev, then headed by Vladimir Puchalsky. A death in the family forced Ornstein&#x27;s return home. In 1903, Ossip Gabrilowitsch heard him play and recommended him to the Moscow Conservatory. In 1904, the nine-year-old Ornstein auditioned for and was accepted by the St. Petersburg school. There he studied composition with Alexander Glazunov and piano with Anna Yesipova. By the age of eleven, Ornstein was earning his way by coaching opera singers. To escape the pogroms incited by the nationalist and antisemitic organisation Union of the Russian People, the family emigrated to the United States on February 24, 1906, exactly ninety-six years before his death. They settled in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side, and Ornstein enrolled in the Institute of Musical Art—predecessor to the Juilliard School—where he studied piano with Bertha Feiring Tapper. In 1911, he made a well-received New York debut with pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Schumann. Recordings two years later of works by Chopin, Grieg, and Poldini demonstrate, according to music historian Michael Broyles, &quot;a pianist of sensitivity, prodigious technical ability, and artistic maturity.&quot;

==Fame and &quot;futurism&quot;==

Ornstein soon moved in a very different direction. He began composing works containing dissonant and startling sounds. Ornstein himself was unsettled by the earliest of these compositions: &quot;I really doubted my sanity at first. I simply said, what is that? It was so completely removed from any experience I ever had.&quot; On March 27, 1914, in London, he gave his first public performance of works then called &quot;futurist&quot;, now known as modernist. In addition to a Busoni arrangement of three Bach choral preludes and several pieces by Schoenberg, Ornstein played a number of his own compositions. The concert caused a major stir. One newspaper described Ornstein&#x27;s work as &quot;the sum of Schoenberg and Scriabine squared.&quot; Others were more analytical: &quot;We have never suffered from such insufferable hideousness, expressed in terms of so-called music.&quot;

Ornstein&#x27;s follow-up performance provoked a near-riot: &quot;At my second concert, devoted to my own compositions, I might have played anything. I couldn&#x27;t hear the piano myself. The crowd whistled and howled and even threw handy missiles on the stage.&quot; The reaction, however, was by no means universally negative—the &quot;Musical Standard&quot; called him &quot;one of the most remarkable composers of the day ... [with] that germ of realism and humanity which is indicative of genius.&quot; By the next year, he was the talk of the American music scene for his performances of cutting-edge works by Schoenberg, Scriabin, Bartók, Debussy, Kodály, Ravel, and Stravinsky (many of them U.S. premieres), as well as his own, even more radical compositions.
Between 1915 and the early 1920s, when he virtually ceased performing in public, Ornstein was one of the best known (by some lights, notorious) figures in American classical music. In the description of Broyles and Denise Von Glahn, his &quot;draw was immense. He constantly performed before packed halls, often more than two thousand, in many places the &#x27;largest audience of the season. His solo piano pieces such as &quot;Wild Men&#x27;s Dance&quot; (aka &quot;Danse Sauvage&quot;; ca. 1913–14) and &quot;Impressions of the Thames&quot; (ca. 1913–14) pioneered the integrated use of the tone cluster in classical music composition, which Henry Cowell, three years Ornstein&#x27;s junior, would do even more to popularize. In the description of scholar Gordon Rumson, &quot;Wild Men&#x27;s Dance&quot; is a &quot;work of vehement, unruly rhythm, compounded of dense chord clusters ... and brutal accents. Complex rhythms and gigantic crashing chords traverse the whole range of the piano. This remains a work for a great virtuoso able to imbue it with a burning, ferocious energy.&quot; Aaron Copland recalled a performance of it as the most controversial moment of his later teen years. In 2002, a &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer declared that it &quot;remains a shocker.&quot; According to critic Kyle Gann, &quot;Impressions of the Thames&quot;, &quot;if Debussyan in its textures, used more prickly chords than Debussy ever dared, and also clusters in the treble range and a low pounding that foreshadowed Charlemagne Palestine, yet modulated ... with a compelling sense of unity.&quot;
As an example of what Ornstein described as &quot;abstract music&quot;, his Sonata for Violin and Piano (1915; not 1913 as is often erroneously given) went even further; &quot;to the brink&quot;, as he put it: &quot;I would say that [the sonata] had brought music just to the very edge. ... I just simply drew back and said, &#x27;beyond that lies complete chaos. In 1916, critic Herbert F. Peyser declared that &quot;the world has indeed moved between the epoch of Beethoven and of Leo Ornstein.&quot; That spring, Ornstein gave a series of recitals in the New York home of one of his advocates; these concerts were crucial precedents for the composer societies around which the modern music scene would thrive in the 1920s. Ornstein also traveled to New Orleans in 1916, where he discovered jazz. The following year, critic James Huneker wrote,
I never thought I should live to hear Arnold Schoenberg sound tame, yet tame he sounds—almost timid and halting—after Ornstein who is, most emphatically, the only true-blue, genuine, Futurist composer alive.

In addition to &quot;futurist&quot;, Ornstein was also sometimes labeled—along with Cowell and others in their circle—an &quot;ultra-modernist.&quot; An article in the &quot;Baltimore Evening Sun&quot; referred to him as &quot;the intransigent pianist, who has set the entire musical world by the ears and who is probably the most discussed figure on the concert stage.&quot; In &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot; he was described as &quot;the most salient musical phenomenon of our time.&quot; Swiss-born composer Ernest Bloch declared him &quot;the single composer in America who displays positive signs of genius.&quot;

By 1918, Ornstein was sufficiently renowned that a full-length biography of him was published. The book, by Frederick H. Martens, suggests not only the level of Ornstein&#x27;s fame at age twenty-four, but also his divisive effect on the cultural scene:

Leo Ornstein to many represents an evil musical genius wandering without the utmost pale of tonal orthodoxy, in a weird No-Man&#x27;s Land haunted with tortuous sound, with wails of futuristic despair, with cubist shrieks and post-impressionist cries and crashes. He is the great anarch, the iconoclast.
 
Cowell, who had encountered Ornstein while studying in New York, would pursue a similarly radical style as part of a grand intellectual and cultural mission, which also involved ambitious writings on music theory and publishing and promotional efforts in support of the avant-garde. Ornstein, the vanguard iconoclast of American classical music, followed a much more idiosyncratic muse: &quot;I&#x27;m guided entirely by just my musical instinct as to what I feel is consequential or inconsequential.&quot; Evidence of that is the fact that, even at the height of his ultra-modernist notoriety, he also wrote several lyrical, tonal works, such as the First Sonata for Cello and Piano: &quot;[It] was written in less than a week under a compulsion that was not to be resisted&quot;, Ornstein later said. &quot;Why I should have heard this romantic piece at the same period that I was tumultuously involved in the primitivism of [other works] is beyond my understanding.&quot; Commenting on the piece after Ornstein&#x27;s death approximately three-quarters of a century later, critic Martin Anderson wrote that it &quot;rivals Rachmaninov&#x27;s [cello sonata] in gorgeous tunes.&quot;
Before the turn of the decade—probably in 1918 or 1919—Ornstein produced one of his most distinctive works involving tone clusters, &quot;Suicide in an Airplane&quot;. Its score calls for a high-speed bass ostinato pattern meant to simulate the sound of engines and capture the sensation of flight. The piece would serve as an inspiration for the &quot;Airplane Sonata&quot; (1923) of George Antheil, who reflected Ornstein&#x27;s influence in other works such as &quot;Sonata Sauvage&quot; (1923). Writing in 2000, pianist and historian Joseph Smith cited &quot;Suicide in an Airplane&quot; among those pieces of Ornstein&#x27;s that &quot;represented (and may still represent) the &quot;ne plus ultra&quot; of pianistic violence.&quot;

==Transition in the 1920s==

Ornstein, burned out, effectively gave up his celebrated performance career in the early 1920s. His &quot;music was soon forgotten&quot;, writes scholar Erik Levi, leaving him &quot;an essentially peripheral figure in American musical life.&quot; As described by Broyles, &quot;Ornstein had mostly retired by the time the new music organizations of the 1920s appeared. Too early and too independent, Ornstein had little desire to participate in the modernist movement by the time it caught hold in the United States. ... [He] seemed little bothered by the publicity or the lack of it. He listened only to his own voice.&quot;

Ornstein&#x27;s primary compositional style was changing as well. As described by latter-day critic Gordon Rumson, his

musical language organised itself into a shimmering, luminous gradation between simplicity and harshness. The melodies have a Hebraic tint, and Ornstein does not shy from placing dissonant and tonal music side by side. This shifting of style is just one of Ornstein&#x27;s creative tools. More importantly, there is a directness of emotion that makes the music genuinely appealing. It should also be noted that his music is ideally written for the piano and is clearly the work of a master pianist.

This transformation contributed to Ornstein&#x27;s fade into obscurity. Those whom he had inspired now rejected him, almost as vehemently as the critics he had shocked a decade earlier. &quot;[H]e had been radical modernism&#x27;s poster boy throughout the 1910s, and when he abandoned that style for one more expressive the ultramoderns reacted as a lover scorned&quot;, according to Broyles. &quot;Not even Cowell, known for his accepting temperament, could forgive Ornstein.&quot;

Having abandoned not only the concert stage, but also the income that went with it, Ornstein signed an exclusive contract with the Ampico label to make piano rolls. He made over two dozen rolls for Ampico, mostly of a nonmodernist repertoire; the composers he performed most often were Chopin, Schumann, and Liszt. Two rolls contained his own compositions: &quot;Berceuse (Cradle Song)&quot; (ca. 1920–21) and &quot;Prélude tragique&quot; (1924). Ornstein never recorded, in any format, even a single example of his futurist pieces which had brought him fame.
In the mid-1920s, Ornstein left New York to accept a teaching post at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, later part of the University of the Arts. During this period, he wrote some of his most important work, including the Piano Concerto, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925. Two years later, he produced his Piano Quintet. An epic tonal work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements, it is recognized as a masterpiece of the genre.

==Later life==

In the early 1930s, Ornstein gave his last public performance. A few years later, he and his wife—the former Pauline Cosio Mallet-Prèvost (1892–1985), also a pianist—founded the Ornstein School of Music in Philadelphia. Among the students there, John Coltrane and Jimmy Smith would go on to major careers in jazz. The Ornsteins directed and taught at the school until it closed with their retirement in 1953. They essentially disappeared from public view until the mid-1970s, when they were tracked down by music historian Vivian Perlis: the couple was spending the winter in a Texas trailer park (they also had a home in New Hampshire). Ornstein had continued to compose music; equipped with a powerful memory, he was not diligent about writing it all down and had not sought to publicize it for decades. Though his style had tempered greatly since the 1910s, it retained its unique character, and with his rediscovery came a new burst of productivity. In Gann&#x27;s description, piano works composed by Ornstein in his eighties, such as &quot;Solitude&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous at the Lake&quot;, featured melodies that &quot;sprang through endless ornate curlicues that brought no other composer to mind.&quot;
In 1988, the ninety-two-year-old Ornstein wrote his Seventh Piano Sonata. With this composition Ornstein became, by a couple of years, the oldest published composer, until Elliott Carter, ever to produce a substantial new work. On September 23, 1990, at the age of ninety-four, Ornstein completed his final work, the Eighth Piano Sonata. The names of the sonata&#x27;s movements reflect not only the passage of a remarkable span of time, but an undimmed sense of humor and exploratory spirit: I. &quot;Life&#x27;s Turmoil and a Few Bits of Satire&quot; / II. &quot;A Trip to the Attic—A Tear or Two for a Childhood Forever Gone&quot; (a. &quot;The Bugler&quot; / b. &quot;A Lament for a Lost Toy&quot; / c. &quot;A Half-Mutilated Cradle—Berceuse&quot; / d. &quot;First Carousel Ride and Sounds of a Hurdy-Gurdy&quot;) / III. &quot;Disciplines and Improvisations.&quot; Reviewing the work&#x27;s New York debut, critic Anthony Tommasini wrote, &quot;Between the roaring craziness of the first and third movements, the middle movement is a suite of four short musical musings on childhood mementos discovered in an attic. Though completely incongruous, the shift in tone is audacious and the music disarming. The audience listened raptly, then erupted in applause.&quot;

On February 24, 2002, Ornstein died of natural causes in Green Bay, Wisconsin. At the age of 106, he was among the longest-lived of composers.

<text>Borscht () is a sour soup, made with meat stock, vegetables and seasonings, common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. In English, the word &quot;borscht&quot; is most often associated with the soup&#x27;s variant of Ukrainian origin, made with red beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which give the dish its distinctive red color. The same name, however, is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white borscht, and cabbage borscht.

Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and umbels of common hogweed (&quot;Heracleum sphondylium&quot;), an herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its Slavic name. With time, it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups, among which the Ukrainian beet-based red borscht has become the most popular. It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed vegetables, which—as well as beetroots—usually include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes, and tomatoes. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold, and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth drink. It is often served with smetana or sour cream, hard-boiled eggs or potatoes, but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes, such as &#x27; or&#x27;, that can be served with the soup.

Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and—by way of migration away from the Russian Empire—to other continents. In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites, the groups who first brought it there from Europe. Several ethnic groups claim borscht, in its various local implementations, as their own national dish consumed as part of ritual meals within Greek Catholic, Roman Catholic, and Jewish religious traditions.

== Etymology ==
The name ultimately derives from the word (&#x27;, , ), which is common to East Slavic languages, such as Ukrainian and Russian. Together with cognates in other Slavic languages, it comes from Proto-Slavic &quot;*bŭrščǐ&quot;, &#x27;hogweed&#x27;, and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*bhr̥stis&quot;, &#x27;point&#x27;, &#x27;stubble&#x27;. Common hogweed (&#x27;) was the soup&#x27;s principal ingredient before it was replaced with other vegetables, notably beetroot in the Ukrainian version.

The English spelling &quot;borscht&quot; comes from Yiddish (&quot;&quot;), as the dish was first popularized in North America by Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe.

== Ingredients and preparation ==

The stock is typically made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork or a combination of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.

The vegetables most commonly added to borscht are beetroots, white cabbage, carrots, parsley root, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Some recipes may also call for beans, tart apples, turnip, swede, celeriac, zucchini or bell peppers. Parsnip may be used as a substitute for parsley root, and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially lard or butter) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.

The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables—by sautéing, braising, boiling or baking—separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven (traditional masonry stove, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had to be taken into account in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form &#x27; rather than &#x27;.

The soup is typically flavored with a wide selection of herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.

=== Beet sour ===
The dominant tastes in borscht are sweet and sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. The sour is made by covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into dextran (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as &quot;chametz&quot; (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may also be added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate.

The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as &quot;kvas&quot; (; compare kvass) and in Yiddish as &#x27; (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian &#x27;, &#x27;pickle juice&#x27;, Polish &quot;&quot;, &#x27;broth&#x27;). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may also be added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast marinade.

As the traditional method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning at least several days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients. Vinegar, tomato products, lemon juice or citric acid may be used, as well as dry red wine, dill pickle juice, murături juice, sauerkraut juice, tart apples, Mirabelle plums, apricots, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture.

== Variations ==

=== Ukrainian ===

There are multiple examples of the soup in Ukrainian cuisine. Virtually every oblast has its own version. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the type of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kyiv variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.

Borscht is symbolic of hospitality in Ukraine and is part of multiple traditional celebrations in rituals. In some parts of Ukraine, the third day of a wedding celebration is called &quot;do nevistky na borshch&quot;, which translates to &quot;visit daughter-in-law to eat borscht&quot;. In 2022, UNESCO added &quot;Culture of Ukrainian borscht cooking&quot; to the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, citing the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== Polish ===

As well as the thick borschts described above, Polish cuisine offers a ruby-colored beetroot bouillon known as &quot;, or clear red borscht. It is made by combining strained meat-and-vegetable stock with wild mushroom broth and beet sour. In some versions, smoked meat may be used for the stock and the tartness may be obtained or enhanced by adding lemon juice, dill pickle brine, or dry red wine. It may be served either in a soup bowl or—especially at dinner parties—as a hot beverage in a twin-handled cup, with a croquette or a filled pastry on the side. Unlike other types of borscht, it is not whitened with sour cream.

&#x27;, or Christmas Eve borscht, is a variant of the clear borscht that is traditionally served during the Polish Christmas Eve supper. In this version, meat stock is either omitted or replaced with fish broth, usually made by boiling the heads cut off from fish used in other Christmas Eve dishes. The mushrooms used for cooking the mushroom broth are reserved for &#x27; (small filled dumplings), which are then served with the borscht.

=== Jewish ===
Ashkenazi Jews living in Eastern Europe adopted beetroot borscht from their Slavic neighbors and adapted it to their taste and religious requirements. As combining meat with milk is proscribed by kosher dietary laws, Jews have developed two variants of the soup: meat (&#x27;) and dairy (&#x27;). The meat variant is typically made from beef brisket (pork is never used) and cabbage, while the dairy one is vegetarian, blended with sour cream or a mixture of milk and egg yolks. Both variants typically contain beetroots and onions, and are flavored with beet sour, vinegar or citric acid for tartness and beet sugar for sweetness. Galician Jews traditionally liked their borscht particularly sweet. Jewish borscht may be served either hot or cold, typically with a hot boiled potato on the side. In prewar Eastern Europe it was traditionally put up to ferment around Purim so that it would be ready four weeks later for the Passover holiday.

=== Russian ===

Russian variants include a Siberian style borscht, characterized by meatballs; Pskov borscht with dried smelt from the local lakes; monastic Lenten borscht with marinated kelp instead of cabbage and the Russian Navy borscht (&quot;&quot;), the defining characteristic of which is that the vegetables are cut into square or diamond-shaped chunks rather than julienned.

=== Cold borscht === 

In the summertime, cold borscht is a popular alternative to the aforementioned variants, which are normally served hot. It consists of beet sour or beet juice blended with sour cream, buttermilk, soured milk, kefir or yogurt. The mixture has a distinctive pink or magenta color. It is served refrigerated, typically over finely chopped beetroot, cucumbers, radishes and green onion, together with halves of a hard-boiled egg and sprinkled with fresh dill. Chopped veal, ham, or crawfish tails may be added as well.

This soup was known in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which comprised the territories of modern-day Belarus and Lithuania, and it is still part of the culinary traditions of these and neighboring nations. In Belarusian, it is known as &quot;Chaladnik&quot; and in Lithuanian as &quot;Šaltibarščiai&quot;. The Soviet &quot;Encyclopedia of Housekeeping&quot; has an article on borscht including a &quot;cold borscht&quot; recipe as &quot;borshch kholodniiy&quot;.

== Namesakes without beets ==
Although &quot;borscht&quot; is mostly used to describe a beet-based soup, there are soups in some culinary traditions with the same or similar names, but with sometimes wide variations in ingredients and preparation methods. In such soups, beetroots are not used or merely optional. The principal common trait among such borschts is a tart flavor from sour-tasting ingredients. According to &quot;A Gift to Young Housewives&quot;, a book from the 19th century, &quot;borscht&quot; may or may not include beets (depending from recipe to recipe in the book).

In Polish cuisine, white borscht (&#x27;, also known as &#x27; or &quot;&quot;, &#x27;sour soup&#x27;) is made from a fermented mixture of rye flour or oatmeal and water. It is typically flavored with garlic and marjoram, and served over eggs and boiled fresh sausage; the water in which the sausage was boiled is often used instead of meat stock.
In the Carpathian Mountains of southern Poland, variants of borscht are also made in which the tart taste comes from dairy products, such as whey or buttermilk. Although the deep red color of beetroot borscht may remind those unfamiliar with Polish cuisine of blood, the type of borscht that does contain animal (usually poultry) blood mixed with vinegar is dark brownish-gray in color and aptly called &quot;gray borscht&quot; (&#x27;), which is a regional name of the Polish blood soup better known as &#x27;.
Green borscht (&quot;), a light soup made from leaf vegetables, is an example common in Ukrainian and Russian cuisines. The naturally tart-tasting sorrel is most commonly used, but spinach, chard, nettle, garden orache and occasionally dandelion, goutweed or ramsons, may be added as well, especially after the spring season for sorrel has passed. Like beetroot borscht, it is based on meat or vegetable broth and is typically served with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, sprinkled with dill. There is also a variety of Ukrainian green borscht which includes both sorrel and beetroots.

In Romanian and Moldovan cuisines, a mixture of wheat bran or cornmeal with water that has been left to ferment, similar to, but less cloudy than that used in Polish white borscht, is called &#x27;. It is used to impart a sour taste to a variety of tangy Romanian soups, known as either also &#x27; or &#x27;. Variants include &#x27; (with meatballs), &#x27; (with tripe), &#x27; (with fish) and &quot; (with beetroots).
The Armenian, Azerbaijani and Georgian version of borscht is a hot soup made with beef stock, green peppers and other vegetables, which may or may not include beetroots, and flavored with chopped red chili and fresh cilantro. In ethnic Mennonite cuisine, &quot;borscht&quot; refers to a whole range of seasonal vegetable soups based on beef or chicken stock—from spring borscht made with spinach, sorrel and chard to summer borscht with cabbage, tomatoes, maize and squash to fall and winter borscht with cabbage, beets and potatoes.

In Chinese cuisine, a soup known as &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Russian soup&quot;, is based on red cabbage and tomatoes, and lacks beetroots altogether; also known as &quot;Chinese borscht&quot;, it originated in Harbin, close to the Russian border in northeast China, and has spread as far as Hong Kong. In Shanghai&#x27;s Haipai cuisine, tomatoes are the main ingredient; beef and its broth, onions and cabbages are also added; while flour, rather than sour cream, is used for thickening.

== Garnishes and sides ==
The diversity of borscht styles is matched by the wide choice of garnishes and side dishes with which various types of borscht may be served. Most often, borscht is served with smetena, a soured dairy product similar to the French crème fraîche. The smetana may be served in a separate pitcher for the diners to add the desired amount themselves or the borscht may come already &quot;whitened&quot; with the smetana already added. The cream can also be thickened with flour before being added to the soup. Yogurt and a mixture of milk and yolks are possible substitutes.

Chopped herbs are often sprinkled on the surface of the soup; dill is most common, but parsley, chives or scallion are often added as well. Individual helpings may be spiced up with minced hot peppers or garlic. Many types of borscht are served over halves or quarters of hard-boiled chicken or quail eggs. Navy beans, broad beans or string beans are also a common addition.

Meat, removed from the stock on which the borscht was based, may be cut into smaller chunks and either added back into the soup or served on the side with horseradish or mustard. Bacon and sausages are also commonly used as borscht garnishes. Borscht based on bone stock may be served Old Polish style, with marrow from the bones.

Some types of the soup, such as Poltava borscht, may be served with &quot;,&quot; or thick noodles of wheat or buckwheat flour. Siberian borscht is eaten with boiled meatballs (&#x27;) of minced beef and onion. In Poland and parts of western Ukraine, borscht is typically ladled over &#x27;, or bite-sized ear-shaped dumplings made from pasta dough wrapped around mushroom, buckwheat or meat filling. Mushroom-filled &quot; are particularly associated with Polish Christmas Eve borscht.

Borscht, like any other soup in East Slavic cuisines, is seldom eaten by itself, but rather accompanied by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.

In Ukraine, borscht is often accompanied with &#x27;, or savory, puffy yeast-raised rolls glazed with oil and crushed garlic. In Russian cuisine, borscht may be served with any of assorted side dishes based on &#x27;, or the East European variant of farmer cheese, such as &#x27;, &#x27; or &#x27;. &#x27; are baked round cheese-filled tarts; &#x27; are small pancakes wherein the cheese is mixed into the batter; and a &#x27; is a casserole of buckwheat groats baked with cheese.

&#x27;, or baked dumplings with fillings as for &#x27;, are another common side for both thick and clear variants of borscht. Polish clear borscht may be also served with a croquette or &#x27;. A typical Polish croquette (&#x27;) is made by wrapping a &#x27; (thin pancake) around a filling and coating it in breadcrumbs before refrying; &#x27; () are variously shaped filled hand-held pastries of yeast-raised or flaky dough. An even more exquisite way to serve borscht is with a coulibiac, or a large loaf-shaped pie. Possible fillings for croquettes, &quot; and coulibiacs include mushrooms, sauerkraut and minced meat.

== History ==

=== Precursors ===

Borscht derives from a soup originally made by the Slavs from common hogweed (&quot;&quot;, also known as cow parsnip), which lent the dish its Slavic name. Growing commonly in damp meadows throughout the north temperate zone, hogweed was used not only as fodder (as its English names suggest), but also for human consumption—from Eastern Europe to Siberia, to northwestern North America.

The Slavs collected hogweed in May and used its roots for stewing with meat. As for the stems, leaves, and umbels; these would be chopped, covered with water and left in a warm place to ferment. After a few days, lactic and alcoholic fermentation produced a mixture described as &quot;something between beer and sauerkraut&quot;. This fermented product was then used for cooking a soup.

The said soup—with aforementioned fermented hogweed concoction used—was characterized by a mouth-puckering amount of sourness in its taste, while its smell was described as pungent As the Polish ethnographer wrote in 1830, &quot;Poles have been always partial to tart dishes, which are somewhat peculiar to their homeland and vital to their health.&quot; Simon Syrenius (), a 17th century Polish botanist, described &quot;our Polish hogweed&quot; as a vegetable that was well known throughout Poland, Ruthenia, Lithuania and Samogitia (that is, most of the northern part of Eastern Europe), typically used for cooking a &quot;tasty and graceful soup&quot; with capon stock, eggs, sour cream and millet. More interested in the plant&#x27;s medicinal properties than its culinary use, he also recommended pickled hogweed juice as a cure for fever or hangover.

One of the earliest possible mentions of borscht as a soup is found in the diary of German merchant Martin Gruneweg, who visited Kyiv in 1584. After Gruneweg reached river Borshchahivka in Kyiv&#x27;s vicinity on 17 October 1584, he wrote down a local legend saying that the river was so named because there was a borscht market. However, he doubted the story noting that &quot;Ruthenians buy borscht rarely or never, because everyone cooks their own at home as it&#x27;s their staple food and drink&quot;.

Another early written reference to the Slavic hogweed soup can be found in &quot;&quot; (&quot;Domestic Order&quot;), a 16th century Russian compendium of moral rules and homemaking advice. It recommends growing the plant &quot;by the fence, around the whole garden, where the nettle grows&quot;, to cook a soup of it in springtime and reminds the reader to, &quot;for the Lord&#x27;s sake, share it with those in need&quot;.

Hogweed borscht was mostly a poor man&#x27;s food. The soup&#x27;s humble beginnings are still reflected in Polish fixed expressions, where &quot;cheap like borscht&quot; is the equivalent of &quot;dirt cheap&quot; (also attested as a calque in Yiddish and Canadian English), whereas adding &quot;two mushrooms into borscht&quot; is synonymous with excess. For the professors of the University of Kraków, who led a monastic way of life in the 17th century, hogweed borscht was a fasting dish which they ate regularly from Lent till Rogation days. It was uncommon on the royal table, although according to the 16th century Polish botanist Marcin of Urzędów—citing , a court physician to the Jagiellonian kings of Hungary—the Polish-born King Vladislaus II used to have a Polish hogweed-based dish prepared for him at his court in Buda.

=== Diversification ===
With time, other ingredients were added to the soup, eventually replacing hogweed altogether, and the names &#x27; or &#x27; became generic terms for any sour-tasting soup. In 19th century rural Poland, this term included soups made from barberries, currants, gooseberries, cranberries, celery or plums.
When describing the uses of common hogweed, John Gerard, a 17th century English botanist, observed that &quot;the people of [Poland] and Lithuania [used] to make [a] drink with the decoction of this herb and leaven or some other thing made of meal, which is used instead of beer and other ordinary drink&quot;. It may suggest that hogweed soup was on some occasions combined with a fermented mixture of water and barley flour, oatmeal or rye flour. Such soured, gelatinous flour-and-water mixture, originally known as kissel (from the Proto-Slavic root &quot;*kyslŭ&quot;, &#x27;sour&#x27;) had been already mentioned in &quot;The Tale of Bygone Years&quot;, a 12th century chronicle of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and continued to be a staple of Ukrainian and Russian cooking until the middle of the 19th century. In Poland, a soup based on diluted kissel became known as either &#x27; (from Middle High German &#x27;, &#x27;sour&#x27;) or &#x27; and later—to distinguish it from the red beetroot borscht—as &#x27;, &#x27;white borscht&#x27;.

The earliest known Polish recipes for borscht, written by chefs catering to Polish magnates (aristocrats), are from the late 17th century. , head chef to Prince , included several borscht recipes in his &#x27; (&quot;A Collection of Dishes&quot;), the first cookbook published originally in Polish, in 1682. They include such sour soups as lemon borscht and &quot;royal borscht&quot;, the latter made from assorted dried, smoked or fresh fish and fermented rye bran. A manuscript recipe collection from the family court, dating back to , contains an instruction for making hogweed borscht mixed with poppy seeds or ground almonds. As this was a Lenten dish, it was garnished, in a &#x27; fashion typical of Baroque cuisine, with mock eggs made from finely chopped pike that was partly dyed with saffron and formed into oval balls. An alternative recipe for the almond borscht replaced pickled hogweed with vinegar.
Borscht also evolved into a variety of sour soups to the east of Poland. Examples include onion borscht, a recipe for which was included in a 1905 Russian cookbook, and sorrel-based green borscht, which is still a popular summer soup in Ukraine and Russia. &quot;A Gift to Young Housewives&quot; by Elena Molokhovets, the best-selling Russian cookbook of the 19th century, first published in 1861, contains nine recipes for borscht, some of which are based on kvass, a traditional Slavic fermented beverage made from rye bread. Kvass-based variants were also known in Ukraine at that time; some of them were types of green borscht, while others were similar to the Russian &quot;&quot;.

Before the advent of beet-based borscht, cabbage borscht was of particular importance. Made from either fresh cabbage or sauerkraut, it could be indistinguishable from the Russian shchi. Indeed, the mid-19th century &quot;Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language&quot; defines &quot;&quot; as &quot;a kind of shchi&quot; with beet sour added for tartness. The significance of cabbage as an essential ingredient of borscht is manifest in the Ukrainian proverb, &quot;without bread, it&#x27;s no lunch; without cabbage, it&#x27;s no borscht.&quot;

=== Novel ingredients: beets, tomatoes and potatoes ===

Beet (&quot;&quot;), a plant native to the Mediterranean Basin, was already grown in antiquity. Only the leaves were of culinary use, as the tapered, tough, whitish and bitter-tasting root was considered unfit for human consumption. It is probably that beet greens were used in variants of green borscht long before the invention of the beetroot-based red borscht. Beet varieties with round, red, sweet taproots, known as beetroots, were not reliably reported until the 12th century and did not spread to Eastern Europe before the 16th century.

, a Polish Renaissance poet and moralist, included the earliest known Polish recipe for pickled beetroots in his 1568 book, &quot;Life of an Honest Man&quot;. It would later evolve into &#x27;, or &#x27;, a beet-and-horseradish relish popular in Polish and Jewish cuisines. also recommended the &quot;very tasty brine&quot; left over from beetroot pickling, which was an early version of beet sour. The sour found some applications in Polish folk medicine as a cure for hangover and—mixed with honey—as a sore throat remedy.

It may never be known who first thought of using beet sour to flavor borscht, which also gave the soup its now-familiar red color. One of the earliest mentions of borscht with pickled beets comes from Russian ethnographer Andrey Meyer, who wrote in his 1781 book that people in Ukraine make fermented red beets with &quot;Acanthus&quot;, which they in turn use to cook their borscht. The book &quot;Description of the Kharkiv Governorate&quot; of 1785, which describes the food culture of the Ukrainians, says that borscht was the most consumed food, cooked from beets and cabbage with various other herbal spices and millet, on sour kvass; it was always made with pork lard or beef lard, on holidays with lamb or poultry, and sometimes with game. &#x27;s Polish-German dictionary published in 1806 was the first to define &quot;&quot; as a tart soup made from pickled beetroots.
The fact that certain 19th century Russian and Polish cookbooks, such as &quot;Handbook of the Experienced Russian Housewife&quot; (1842) by and &quot;The Lithuanian Cook&quot; (1854) by , refer to beetroot-based borscht as &quot;Little Russian borscht&quot; (where &quot;Little Russian&quot; is a term used at the time for ethnic Ukrainians under imperial Russian rule) suggests that this innovation took place in what is now Ukraine, whose soils and climate are particularly well suited to beet cultivation. Ukrainian legends, probably of 19th century origin, attribute the invention of beetroot borscht either to Zaporozhian Cossacks, serving in the Polish army, on their way to break the siege of Vienna in 1683, or to Don Cossacks, serving in the Russian army, while laying siege to Azov in 1695.

Spanish conquistadors brought potatoes and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, and tomatoes—fresh, canned or paste—took over from beet sour as the source of tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.

=== Haute cuisine ===
Russian and Polish aristocrats used to employ celebrated French chefs, who later presented their dishes as foreign curios back in France. One of the first French chefs to do so was , who worked briefly for Emperor Alexander I in 1819. In his take on borscht, the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant &quot;&quot; dish with an air of eastern exoticism. Apart from vegetables and beet sour, his recipe calls for a roast chicken, a fried chicken, a duck, a piece of veal, an oxtail, a marrow bone, one pound of bacon, and six large sausages, and suggests serving with beef quenelles, deviled eggs and croûtons.

, &#x27;s apprentice, who was mostly fascinated by the soup&#x27;s vivid ruby-red color, simplified his master&#x27;s recipe, while also securing the place of &#x27; () in French cuisine. and , both of whom had been employed at Polish aristocratic courts, presented borscht to the French public as a Polish soup; their cookbook, &#x27;, published in 1856, contains a borscht recipe under the descriptive name, &#x27; (), which had been changed to &#x27; by the third edition in 1868. In 1867, beetroot borscht was served, along with herrings, sturgeon, coulibiac, Pozharsky cutlets and vinaigrette salad, at a Russian-themed dinner at the International Exposition in Paris, strengthening its international association with Russian culture.

=== Global spread ===
Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, borscht&#x27;s popularity spread beyond its Slavic homeland, largely due to such factors as territorial expansion of the Russian Empire, Russia&#x27;s growing political clout and cultural stature, and waves of emigration out of the country. As Russia grew to cover most of northern and central Eurasia, borscht was introduced to the cuisines of various peoples inhabiting the territories both within and adjacent to the empire, from Finland to the Caucasus and Iran, to Central Asia and China, to Alaska (Russian America).

Borscht&#x27;s westward expansion was less successful; Germans used to scoff at the soup along with other East European fare. What helped the spread of borscht, however, was the popularization by various &quot;haute cuisine&quot; chefs who had their own dishes to present to West Europe.
Mass migration from the Russian Empire to North America—initially mostly by members of persecuted religious minorities—was instrumental in bringing borscht across the Atlantic. Jews from the Pale of Settlement, an area that stretched along the western edges of the Russian Empire and included much of present-day Ukraine, brought with them Ukrainian variety of borscht with beetroot.

The earliest waves of migration, however, occurred at a time when cabbage-based borscht was still the dominant variant of the soup in at least parts of Russia. The Mennonites, who began arriving in Canada and the United States from Russia&#x27;s Volga region in the 1870s, still eschew beetroots in their borscht; instead, Mennonite varieties include &#x27; (with cabbage or sauerkraut) and &#x27; (sorrel-based &quot;summer borscht&quot;). According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; published in 1906, cabbage-based &quot;kraut borscht&quot; was also more popular than the beet-based variant in American Jewish cuisine at the time. Subsequent Jewish immigration helped popularize the red borscht in America.

In the 1930s, when most American hotels refused to accept Jewish guests due to widespread anti-Semitism, New York Jews began flocking to Jewish-owned resorts in the Catskill Mountains for their summer vacations. The area grew into a major center of Jewish entertainment, with restaurants offering all-you-can-eat Ashkenazi Jewish fare, including copious amounts of borscht. Grossinger&#x27;s, one of the largest resorts, served borscht throughout the day, every day of the year. The region became known, initially in derision, as the &quot;Borscht Belt&quot;, reinforcing the popular association between borscht and American Jewish culture. As most visitors arrived in the summertime, the borscht was typically served cold. Marc Gold was one of its largest suppliers, producing 1,750 short tons (1,590 tonnes) a year in his business&#x27;s heyday. Gold&#x27;s borscht consists of puréed beetroots seasoned with sugar, salt and citric acid; it is usually blended with sour cream and served as a refreshing beverage, more aptly described as a &quot;beet smoothie&quot;. Such type of &quot;purplish, watery broth&quot; is, according to Nikolai Burlakoff, author of &quot;The World of Russian Borsch&quot;, &quot;associated in America with borsch, in general, and Jewish borsch in particular.&quot;

=== Borscht in the USSR ===
In the Soviet Union, borscht was one of the most popular everyday dishes. It was described in 2008 by journalist James Meek as &quot;the common denominator of the Soviet kitchen, the dish that tied together ... the high table of the Kremlin and the meanest canteen in the boondocks of the Urals, ... the beetroot soup that pumped like the main artery through the kitchens of the east Slav lands.&quot; Among Soviet leaders, the Ukrainian-born Leonid Brezhnev was especially partial to borscht, which his wife continued to personally cook for him even after they had moved into the Kremlin.
The soup has even played a role in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a communications equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for crewed space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes.

All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root, and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.

However, with urbanization and mass construction of Khrushchyovka type housing, borscht would be affected; there would be no comfortable place to make own days-long dishes with &quot;kvass&quot; and sour foods, in a tiny apartment. At this rate, the idea of making its beet sour lost its initial appeal, making borscht in USSR mainly about beets, not about sourness.

Such a typical Soviet-era book as &quot;Entsyclopedia Domashnego Hozyaistva&quot; () has an article on borscht. The article suggests to make a soup with beets, other vegetables, and a tartness source (&quot;tomato purée&quot;) as a &quot;borscht&quot; in general, but its &quot;no-nation&quot; primary recipe of meat borscht says &quot;&quot;uksus po vkusu&quot; (Cyrillic: уксус по вкусу)&quot;, e.g. only to add vinegar upon tasting the resulting soup. Simply put, the borscht&#x27;s sourness became an option, not a requirement, for a &quot;generic&quot; Soviet borscht, effectively parting ways with older concepts of making sour soups (ones both with or without beets).
* However, the same article mentions the sour variant of the beet soup: it lists separate &quot;Ukrainian borscht&quot; and &quot;Cold borscht&quot; recipes. The &quot;Ukrainian borscht&quot; one properly instructs to make the sour soup with beets by saying &quot;&quot;sbryznut&#x27; uksusom&quot; (Cyrillic: сбрызнуть уксусом)&quot;, e.g. instructs to sprinkle it with some vinegar.
* A beet infusion for borscht is also mentioned in the said article. It involves soaking a beet with boiled water and then adding some vinegar. Again, this makeshift-like substitute for beet sour is listed in the aforementioned Soviet encyclopedia as a way to color borscht, not to sour it.

Era of Stagnation also would affect making borscht from time to time to the next level of simplification: the aforementioned canned tomato products, &quot;paste&quot; or &quot;purée&quot; would be a &quot;deficit&quot; item, a thing not available regularly in one&#x27;s nearby convenience stores. On the other hand, due to urbanization, people would not resort to making own batches of, say, pickled tomatoes. As result, many modern recipes of beet soups labeled as &quot;borscht&quot; list neither a tartness source (lack tomatoes, pickles, etc.) nor a sourness source (lack vinegar, lemon acid powder, let alone beet sour kvass).

== In culture ==
=== As a ritual dish ===
Borscht is often associated with its role in religious traditions of various denominations (Eastern Orthodox, Greek and Roman Catholic, and Jewish) that are common in Eastern Europe. In East Slavic countries, &quot;memorial borscht&quot; is served as the first course at a post-funeral wake. According to a traditional belief, the soul of the departed either feeds on or is carried up to heaven by puffs of steam rising from bowls of borscht and other hot dishes, such as blini, porridge, boiled potatoes or freshly baked bread. In the region of Polesye, straddling the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, the same steaming-hot dishes, including borscht, are given as an offering to the souls of deceased ancestors during the annual semi-pagan remembrance ceremony known as &quot; or Forefathers&#x27; Night.
In Poland and Ukraine, borscht is usually one of the dishes served at a Christmas Eve dinner. Celebrated after the first star has appeared in the sky on December 24 (Roman Catholic) or January 6 (Greek Catholic), it is a meal which is at the same time festive and fasting, a multicourse affair (traditionally, with twelve distinct dishes) that excludes ingredients of land-animal origin. Christmas Eve borscht is, therefore, either vegetarian or based on fish stock and is not typically mixed with sour cream. In Ukraine, the soup contains vegetables that are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, as well as beans and mushrooms. It may be also thickened with wheat flour dry-roasted in a pan instead of the usual roux. The Polish version of Christmas Eve borscht is a clear ruby-red broth. Both Ukrainian and Polish variants are often served with &quot;.

While Christmas in Poland is traditionally linked to red borscht, Lent—the fasting period that leads up to Easter—is associated with a meatless version of white borscht, or &quot;&quot;. Youths used to celebrate Holy Saturday, the last day of the fast, with a mock &quot;funeral&quot; of the white borscht, in which a pot of the soup was either buried in the ground or broken, sometimes—to the crowd&#x27;s amusement—while being carried by an unsuspecting boy on his head. On the next day, the white borscht would reappear on the Easter table, but this time, in its more coveted, meat-based guise with sausage, bacon and eggs.

In Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, vegetarian borscht served with sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as &quot;&quot;, is considered an essential dish during the Passover period. As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to provide an opportunity to use up the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season. Cold borscht blended with sour cream is also popular on Shavuot (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. Seudah Shlishit, or the third meal of the Shabbat, often includes borscht as well.

In 2022, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced that it had placed &quot;Culture of cooking borscht in Ukraine&quot; on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding due to the risk that Russia&#x27;s invasion posed to the soup&#x27;s status as an element of Ukraine&#x27;s cultural heritage. The new status means Ukraine could now apply for special funds to finance projects promoting and protecting the dish.

=== As an ethnic dish ===
In its currently most popular, beet-based version, borscht most probably originated in what is now Ukraine. Borscht&#x27;s role as a staple of everyday Ukrainian diet is reflected in the Ukrainian saying, &quot;borscht and porridge are our food&quot; (compare the equivalent Russian saying, where borscht is replaced with shchi). The hearty soup in which the beetroot is just one of sundry vegetables, as opposed to the typically Polish clear beet broth, is still known in Poland as &quot;Ukrainian borscht&quot;.

Borscht is associated with and claimed by several ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own national or ethnic dish and cultural icon. Such claims are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as the soup&#x27;s history predates the emergence in Eastern Europe of modern nation states with their ever-shifting borders. Borscht, in the words of Burlakoff, &quot;is perfectly suited to a global culture&quot;. He describes it as &quot;a global phenomenon&quot;, in which &quot;local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non-specialist to grasp that any single example of it is something that is part of a unified tradition&quot;. In his view, borscht &quot;is an almost perfect example of ... &#x27;glocalization&#x27;—a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation; ... a highly localized product that became globalized, and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones.&quot;

However, according to Irina Perianova, a Russian linguist and anthropologist, &quot;people tend to be very proprietal about their food and proud of it.&quot; Perianova offers competing Russian and Ukrainian views on the origin and ingredients of borscht as an example of &quot;a common connection between culinary and territorial claims&quot;, which results in the culinary area turning into &quot;a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of myths&quot;. In 2020 Ukraine began the process to have borscht recognised as an element of the country&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage, an initiative supported by chefs and food writers such as Marianna Dushar.

In the Soviet Union, government-sponsored cookbooks, such as &quot;The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food&quot; curated by Anastas Mikoyan, &quot;Cookery&quot; and &quot;Directory of Recipes and Culinary Production&quot;, promoted a unified Soviet cuisine with standardized and nutritionally &quot;rational&quot; versions of traditional dishes. The same cooking techniques and recipes were taught in culinary vocational schools throughout the country, establishing a common cooking style in Soviet cafés and restaurants. Though inspired by the cuisines of the country&#x27;s various ethnic groups, many recipes were presented as part of an overall Soviet heritage, disassociated from their individual geographic origins.

By many people both inside and outside the Soviet Union, borscht was increasingly seen not as an ethnic Ukrainian soup, but as a Soviet or—metonymically—Russian dish. This approach was criticized by William Pokhlebkin, a preeminent Russian food writer, who unequivocally described beet-based borscht as one of the &quot;dishes of Ukrainian cookery&quot; which &quot;have entered the menu of international cuisine&quot;. &quot;One could understand&quot;, he wrote, &quot;and forgive foreigners for calling borscht or &quot;&quot; Russian national dishes, but when it turns out that they gleaned the information from Soviet cookbooks or from restaurant menus, one is embarrassed for our authors and chefs, who popularize the national cuisines of our peoples [that is, the ethnic groups of the Soviet Union] with such ignorance.&quot;

According to Meek: Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore political boundaries. ... The faint outline of the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.

<text>The Bell Aircraft Corporation was an American aircraft manufacturer, a builder of several types of fighter aircraft for World War II but most famous for the Bell X-1, the first supersonic aircraft, and for the development and production of many important civilian and military helicopters. Bell also developed the Reaction Control System for the Mercury Spacecraft, North American X-15, and Bell Rocket Belt. The company was purchased in 1960 by Textron, and lives on as Bell Textron.

==History==
As a pilot, Larry Bell saw his first plane at an air show, starting a lifelong fascination with aviation. Bell dropped out of high school in 1912 to join his brother in the burgeoning aircraft industry at the Glenn L. Martin Company, where by 1914 he had become shop superintendent. By 1920, Bell was vice president and general manager of Martin, then based in Cleveland. Feeling that he deserved part ownership, in late 1924, he presented Martin with an ultimatum. Mr. Martin refused, and Bell quit.

Bell spent several years out of the aviation industry, but in 1928 was hired by Reuben H. Fleet at Consolidated Aircraft, in Buffalo, New York, where he was guaranteed an interest in the company. Before long, Bell became general manager and business was booming, but he still wanted to run his own company. Although he could raise local capital, he knew he would not be able to compete with either Consolidated or Curtiss-Wright, the two major aircraft builders also based in Buffalo. Fortunately, in 1935 Fleet decided to move Consolidated Aircraft to San Diego, and Bell stayed behind to establish his own company, the Bell Aircraft Company, on 10 July 1935, headquartered in the former Consolidated plant at 2050 Elmwood Avenue in North Delaware area of Buffalo.

Bell was the third major aircraft builder to occupy the site. The factory complex was originally built in 1916 for the Curtiss Aeroplane &amp; Motor Company, and during World War I had been considered the largest airplane factory in the world.

Bell&#x27;s first military contract followed in 1937 with the development of the ill-fated YFM-1 Airacuda, an unconventional bomber-destroyer powered by two Allison-powered pusher propellers. The YFM-1 incorporated groundbreaking technology for the time, with gyro stabilized weapons sighting and a thermionic fire control system. Including the prototype, just 13 Airacudas were produced, and these saw only limited service with the USAAC before being scrapped in 1942.

Bell enjoyed much success the following year with the development of the single engine P-39 Airacobra, which 9,588 were built. Putting their previous experience with Allison engines to good use, the P-39 placed the engine in the center of the aircraft, with the propeller driven by a long shaft through which a 37mm cannon was also mounted, firing through the propeller&#x27;s spinner. Due to persistent development and production problems, the original turbosupercharger was deleted from production models, instead using a single-stage, single-speed supercharger, as was standard on all other Allison-powered products, with the exception of the P-38.

The P-39 performed poorly at high altitudes compared to newer, late-war designs. Most Allied forces thought the Airacobra effective only for ground attack roles, as demonstrated by a few U.S. Army Air Forces units that flew P-39s, such as the so-called &quot;Cactus Air Force&quot; on Guadalcanal in 1942–43. However, the Soviet Air Force used their Lend-Lease P-39s primarily in the air-to-air role, where they found it to excel as a front-line fighter against some of the best pilots and aircraft of the Luftwaffe. The Soviet-flown P-39s were the main reason that the aircraft is credited with highest number of individual kills attributed to any U.S. fighter type.

A somewhat larger and more powerful version of the P-39 was produced shortly before the end of World War II. Called the P-63 Kingcobra, this warplane addressed many of the shortcomings of the P-39, though it was produced too late in the war to make any significant contribution. 2,971 P-63s were built between 1943 and 1945, many delivered to the Soviet Union. Also, by that time, the Army Air Forces already had the superior P-47 Thunderbolt and P-38 Lightning fighter-bombers.

In October 1942, The Bell-built twin-jet P-59 Airacomet was the first American jet aircraft to fly. Unfortunately, performance was below expectations, roughly on par with contemporaneous propeller-driven aircraft, an outcome generally attributed to the extremely short development timeframe required by the USAAF, as well as the intense secrecy imposed on the project. Design had begun in September 1941, during which time the Bell team was guided mostly by theory, as General Electric would not finish and begin testing the first engine until March 1942. Also, General Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold had forbidden use of wind tunnels to test and optimize the design, but later relented somewhat, only allowing the group to use the low-speed tunnel at Wright Field, Ohio. Bell engineers could only guess at the performance characteristics. Originally intended initially as a production aircraft, the P-59 nevertheless became an important experimental testbed for jet technology, providing invaluable data for development of later jet airplanes.

During World War II, Bell also built heavy bombers under license from other aircraft companies at a factory near Marietta, Georgia, just northwest of Atlanta. Online by mid-1943, the new plant produced hundreds of Consolidated B-24 Liberators and Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers. In mid-1944, the production of the B-24 was consolidated from several different companies (including some in Texas) to two large factories: Consolidated Vultee in San Diego and Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Willow Run factory near Detroit, Michigan, which had been specially designed to produce B-24s. For the rest of the war, Bell&#x27;s Marietta plant, under the management of Carl Cover and James V. Carmichael concentrated on producing B-29s, producing 668 of them by the time contract expired in the fall of 1945. Bell ranked 25th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.

=== After World War II ===

As the postwar defense industry downsized, Bell consolidated its operations at the Wheatfield plant, near Buffalo. The aircraft factory in Marietta later became the property of the Lockheed Corporation, which has used it for producing C-130 Hercules, C-141 Starlifter, and C-5 Galaxy transport planes. Although Bell designed several more fighter plane designs during and after WW II, none of these ever entered mass-production.

The XP-77 was a small fighter using non-strategic materials; it was not successful. The XP-83 was a jet escort fighter similar in layout to the P-59 that was cancelled. The Bell XF-109 was a supersonic vertical takeoff fighter that was cancelled in 1961.

Perhaps Bell Aircraft&#x27;s most important contribution to the history of fixed-wing aircraft development would be the design and building of the experimental Bell X-1 rocket plane, the world&#x27;s first airplane to break the sound barrier, and its follow-on, the Bell X-2. Unlike the usual designations for American aircraft, the X-1 models were successive (mostly identical) units of the X-1 program: the X-1, X-1A, X-1B, X-1C, X-1D, and X-1E.

Bell went on to design and produce several different experimental aircraft during the 1950s. These helped the U.S. Air Force and the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) explore the boundaries of aircraft design, and paved the way for the founding of NASA and the exploration of outer space. The X-2 Starbuster achieved Mach 3 (2,100 mph) and a height of 126,000 ft in 1955, blazing a technological trail for the development of spacecraft.

Bell played a crucial role in the development of rocket propulsion after WWII, spearheaded by the likes of some of the most brilliant minds in rocket science like Walter Dornberger (ex-commander of Nazi Germany Peenemünde Army Research Center) and Wendell Moore. Bell developed and fielded the world&#x27;s first nuclear-tipped Air-to-Surface cruise missile, the GAM-63 RASCAL in 1957. Wendell Moore developed the Bell rocket belt, utilizing peroxide monopropellant rocket engines. While the rocket belt failed to be commercially developed, the rocket technology proved invaluable in future Bell programs. Bell&#x27;s crowning achievement in the realm of rocketry was the Agena rocket engine. The Agena was a 12,000 lbf bi-propellant rocket that is considered to this day to be one of the most reliable rockets ever built. 360 units were produced starting in the late 1950s and it was responsible for inserting into orbit most of the satellites launched by the United States in the 1960s.

Helicopter development began at Bell Aircraft in 1941 with the Bell Model 30 first flying in 1943. Bell Helicopter became the only part of Bell Aircraft still producing aircraft when Bell was purchased by the Textron Corporation. That part of Textron is now known today as Bell Helicopter. After a series of successful helicopter designs, the UH-1 Iroquois became the most famous helicopter of the War in Vietnam, and Bell Helicopter still designs and manufactures helicopters today.

Lawrence Bell died in 1956, and for several years afterwards the company was in financial difficulty.

Textron purchased the Bell Aerospace division on 5 July 1960. Bell Aerospace was composed of three divisions of Bell Aircraft, including the helicopter division. Bell Aerospace Textron continued to play a significant role in NASA&#x27;s mission to land men on the Moon in the 1960s. Bell designed and built the Reaction Control system for Project Mercury&#x27;s Redstone command module and a similar system was incorporated into the North American X-15 spaceplane. NASA selected Bell to develop and built the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV), three of which were built in the early 1960s to train the Apollo astronauts to land on the Moon. Bell also designed the rocket engine used in the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) Ascent Propulsion System, which was responsible for getting NASA&#x27;s astronauts off the Moon.

<text>Andrea del Castagno () or Andrea di Bartolo di Bargilla (; – 19 August 1457) was an Italian Renaissance painter in Florence, influenced chiefly by Masaccio and Giotto di Bondone. His works include frescoes in Sant&#x27;Apollonia in Florence and the painted equestrian monument of Niccolò da Tolentino (1456) in Florence Cathedral. He in turn influenced the Ferrarese school of Cosmè Tura, Francesco del Cossa and Ercole de&#x27; Roberti.

==Life==
===Early years===

Andrea del Castagno was born at Castagno, a village near Monte Falterona, not far from Florence. During the war between Florence and Milan, he lived in Corella, returning to his home after its end. In 1440 he moved to Florence under the protection of Bernadetto de&#x27; Medici. Here he painted the portraits of the citizens hanged after the Battle of Anghiari on the facade of the Palazzo del Podestà, gaining the nickname of &quot;Andrea degli Impiccati&quot;.

Little is known about his training, though it has been hypothesised that he apprenticed under Fra Filippo Lippi and Paolo Uccello. In 1440–1441 he executed the fresco of the &quot;Crucifixion with Saints&quot; in the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova, whose perspective-oriented construction and figures show the influence of Masaccio.

In 1442 he was in Venice where he executed frescoes in the San Tarasio Chapel of the church of San Zaccaria. Later he also worked in St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, leaving a fresco of the &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot; (1442–1443).

Back in Florence, he designed a stained window depicting the &quot;Deposition&quot; for the Duomo. On 30 May 1445 he became a member of the Guild of the Medicians. From the same year is the fresco of &quot;Madonna and Child with Saints&quot; in the Contini Bonacossi Collection (Uffizi).

===&quot;The Last Supper&quot;===
In 1447 Castagno worked in the refectory of the Benedictine nuns at Sant&#x27;Apollonia in Florence, painting, in the lower part, a fresco of the Last Supper, accompanied above by other scenes portraying the Passion of Christ: the &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, &quot;Entombment&quot;, and &quot;Resurrection&quot;, which are now damaged. This combination of scenes is not known to have been represented before. He also painted a lunette in the convent&#x27;s cloister, depicting a &quot;Pietà&quot;. Many important Florentine families had daughters in the convent at Sant&#x27;Apollonia, so painting there probably brought Andrea to their attention.

The &quot;Last Supper&quot; displays Andrea del Castagno&#x27;s talents at their best. The detail and naturalism of this fresco show the ways in which he departed from earlier artistic styles. It is likely that Leonardo da Vinci was already familiar with this work before he painted his own &quot;Last Supper&quot; in a more dramatic form to contrast with the stillness of these works, so that more emotion would be displayed.

===Late activity===
In 1449–1450 he painted the &quot;Assumption with Saints Julian and Miniato&quot; for the main altar (in the Saint Julian Chapel) of the church of San Miniato fra le Torri in Florence (now in Berlin). 

In the same years he collaborated with Filippo Carducci to paint a series of &quot;Illustrious People&quot; for the Villa Carducci at Legnaia. These include Pippo Spano, Farinata degli Uberti, Niccolò Acciaioli, Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, the Cumaean Sibyl, Esther and Tomyris.

Also from around 1450 is the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; in London, as well as the &quot;David with the Head of Goliath&quot; and the &quot;Portrait of a Man,&quot; both in Washington. Between January 1451 and September 1453 he completed the frescoes of &quot;Scenes of the Life of the Virgin&quot; left unfinished by Domenico Veneziano in the church of Sant&#x27;Egidio, Florence (now lost). In October Filippo Carducci commissioned him to paint frescoes for his villa at Soffiano, of which today an &quot;Eve&quot; and a ruined &quot;Madonna with Child&quot; survive.

In 1455 Andrea del Castagno worked in the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata (frescoes with the &quot;Trinity with Saints Jerome, Paula and Eustochium&quot; and &quot;Saint Julian and the Redeemer&quot;, the former showing a stressed realism). A &quot;Crucifixion&quot; for Sant&#x27;Apollonia from those years is also attributed to him. In 1456 he executed the fresco of the &quot;Equestrian Monument of Niccolò da Tolentino&quot; in the Duomo of Florence, paralleling the similar painting by Paolo Uccello portraying Sir John Hawkwood.

==Supposed murderer==
Giorgio Vasari, an artist and biographer of the Italian Renaissance, alleged that Castagno murdered the artist Domenico Veneziano, but this is impossible, since Veneziano died in 1461, four years after Castagno died of the plague. It has been suggested that Vasari was confusing this murder case with another one involving a &quot;Domenico di Matteo&quot; who was killed by an &quot;Andreino&quot; in 1448, but the archival record shows that this is a misreading: &quot;A cursory examination reveals two things: first, that the name of the dead painter is not Domenico di Matteo, but Domenico di Marco; and second, and much more crucially, that there is no mention of him having been killed by a painter named Andrea or Andreino.&quot; However, this wholly false story coloured Castagno&#x27;s reputation for centuries. The sinister portrait engraving (apparently entirely invented) that prefaced his &quot;Life&quot; in the second edition of Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; reflects this.

<text>Monica Denise Arnold (formerly Brown; born October 24, 1980) is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, and actress. Born and raised in College Park, Georgia, she began performing as a child and joined a traveling gospel choir by the age of ten. Monica signed with record producer Dallas Austin through his label Rowdy Records in 1993, and gained prominence following the release of her debut studio album, &quot;Miss Thang&quot; (1995). Her follow-up albums were met with continued success; her second, &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot; (1998) remains her best-selling album and spawned three &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-number one singles: &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot; (with Brandy), &quot;The First Night&quot; and &quot;Angel of Mine&quot;.

She then parted ways with Arista and Rowdy Records in favor of Clive Davis&#x27;s J Records upon the label&#x27;s launch in 2000. Her Japan-exclusive third album, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; (2002) was met with a steep critical and commercial decline, although its partial re-issue, &quot;After the Storm&quot; (2003), served as her fourth album and became her first to debut atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Executively produced by rapper Missy Elliott, it was led by the single &quot;So Gone&quot;, which peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Her fifth and sixth albums, &quot;The Makings of Me&quot; (2006) and &quot;Still Standing&quot; (2010), debuted at numbers eight and two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, respectively; the latter received two Grammy Award nominations. Her seventh, &quot;New Life&quot; (2012) debuted at number four on the chart despite unfavorable critical response; her eighth album, &quot;Code Red&quot; (2015) marked her final release with RCA.

Monica&#x27;s popularity translated into an acting career, with television roles in &quot;Living Single&quot; (1996), &quot;Felicity&quot; (2001), and &quot;American Dreams&quot; (2003), and film roles including &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; (2000), &quot;Love Song&quot; (2000), and &quot;Pastor Brown&quot; (2009). In 2008, she served as an advisor for the NBC competition series &quot;The Voice&quot;. The recording of her 2008 single, &quot;Still Standing&quot; (featuring Ludacris) along with her personal life resulted in her receiving a reality television series, &quot;&quot; on BET.

Monica has sold more than five million albums in the United States. In 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed Monica at number 24 on its list of the Top 50 R&amp;B and Hip-Hop Artists of the past 25 years. A five-time nominee, she won Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot; at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. Her other accolades include a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Award, a BET Award, and a Soul Train Music Award.

==Early life==
Monica Denise Arnold was born in College Park, Georgia, the only daughter of Marilyn Best, a Delta Air Lines customer service representative and former church singer, and M.C. &quot;Billy&quot; Arnold Jr, who was a mechanic for an Atlanta freight company. Arnold&#x27;s mother is of African American descent and her father is African American with Indian and Irish ancestry. She has a younger brother, Montez (born in 1983), and a half brother, Jermond Grant, on her father&#x27;s side. Monica is also a cousin of record producer Polow da Don, and is related to rapper Ludacris through her mother&#x27;s second marriage to Reverend Edward Best, a Methodist minister.

At the age of 2, Monica followed in her mother&#x27;s footsteps with regular performances at the Jones Hill Chapel United Methodist Church in Marilyn&#x27;s hometown Newnan, Georgia. While growing up in the modest circumstances of a single-parent home after her parents&#x27; 1984 separation and 1987 divorce, Monica continued training herself in singing and became a frequent talent-show contestant, winning over 20 local singing competitions throughout her early teenage years. When she was 10 years old, she became the youngest member of &quot;Charles Thompson and the Majestics&quot;, a traveling 12-person gospel choir. She attended North Clayton High School with rapper 2 Chainz. She graduated from high school in 1997 at age 16, having skipped ahead scholastically by studying year-round with a private tutor.

==Career==
===1991–2000: &quot;Miss Thang&quot; and &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;===

In 1991, at the age of eleven, Monica was discovered by music producer Dallas Austin at the Center Stage auditorium in Atlanta, performing Whitney Houston 1986&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;. Amazed by her voice, Dallas offered her a record deal with his label Rowdy Records, and consulted rapper Queen Latifah to work as Monica&#x27;s first manager. Shortly afterwards Dallas and then staff producers Tim &amp; Bob entered the studio with Monica to start writing and producing her debut &quot;Miss Thang,&quot; which was released in July 1995 and peaked at number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (and number seven on the Top R&amp;B Albums chart). To date the album has sold 1.5 million copies in the United States. By January 2000, it received triple platinum certification by the RIAA for three million units. The album yielded three singles, including her debut &quot;Don&#x27;t Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days)&quot;, and its follow-up &quot;Before You Walk Out of My Life&quot;, which made Monica the youngest artist to have two consecutive chart-topping songs on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Singles chart. &quot;Miss Thang&quot; earned Monica an American Music Award nomination for Favorite New Soul/R&amp;B Artist. The video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Take It Personal&quot;, directed by Rich Murray, was nominated for a Billboard Award for best video by a new artist.

Following the album&#x27;s success, Monica&#x27;s mainstream success was boosted. Her 1997 song &quot;For You I Will&quot;—recorded for &quot;Space Jam: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture&quot; (1996)—became her next pop hit, peaking at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was written by Diane Warren. The following year, she was asked to team up with singer Brandy and producer Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins to record &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;, the first single from both of their second albums. Released in May 1998, surrounding highly publicized rumors about a real-life catfight between both singers, the duet became both the biggest hit of the summer and the biggest hit of 1998 in general in America, spending thirteen weeks on top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It earned the pair a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal&quot; and garnered multi-platinum sales (to date, it remains as one of the top twenty most successful American singles in history based on &quot;Billboard&quot; chart success).
Jermaine Dupri, David Foster and Austin consulted on the album &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;, which was released later that year and it eventually became Monica&#x27;s biggest-selling album; selling over 2,016,000 copies.
In June 2000, the album was certified triple platinum by the RIAA for three million shipped units. It yielded another two U.S. number-one hits with &quot;The First Night&quot; and &quot;Angel of Mine&quot;, a cover of Eternal&#x27;s 1997 single, as well as a remake of Richard Marx&#x27; &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; proclaimed it &quot;closer to soul&#x27;s source... harking back past hip-hop songbirds like Mary J. Blige and adult-contemporary sirens like Toni Braxton&quot;, while AllMusic called the album an &quot;irresistible sounding [and] immaculately crafted musical backdrop [...] as good as mainstream urban R&amp;B gets in 1998.&quot; Monica has also made guest appearances on several television shows such as &quot;Living Single&quot; (1996), &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1997, 1999) and the Cartoon Network special &quot;Brak Presents The Brak Show Starring Brak&quot; (2000).

===2000–2005: &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; and &quot;After the Storm&quot;===
In 2000, Monica made her film debut as Camille Livingston, a young woman torn between the life her parents have planned for her and the world she experiences after meeting a musician from the wrong side of the tracks, in &quot;Love Song&quot;, the third drama produced by MTV Films. &quot;Love Song&quot; was released on December 1, 2000, and debuted the song &quot;What My Heart Says&quot; along with promotion for the singer&#x27;s third studio album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; (2002). Monica has also acted in &quot;Felicity&quot; (2001) and &quot;American Dreams&quot; (2003), playing Mary Wells and singing &quot;My Guy&quot;.

Also in 2000, Monica contributed chorus vocals for &quot;I&#x27;ve Got to Have It&quot;, a collaboration with Jermaine Dupri and rapper Nas. Released as the &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot; theme song, the track saw minor success in the United States. The following year, she released the Ric Wake–produced &quot;Just Another Girl&quot;, a promotional single for the &quot;Down to Earth&quot; soundtrack.

A year later, Monica channeled much of her heavily media-discussed experiences into the production of her third studio album, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, her first release on her mentor Clive Davis&#x27;s newly established label J Records. &quot;I just wanted to give the people back something that had personal passion, instead of just, &#x27;Oh, let&#x27;s dance to this record&#x27;&quot;, she said regarding the issues worked into the tracks. The first single &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, a Rodney Jerkins-produced R&amp;B-dance track, saw minor to moderate success on the international charts but failed to enter the higher half of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. A follow-up song, &quot;Too Hood&quot;, also got a lukewarm response and as a result, the album&#x27;s tentative release was pushed back several times. &quot;I don&#x27;t think people wanted to hear a big fun record from me, after knowing all the things that I had personally experienced&quot;, Monica second-guessed her new material which saw both early and heavy bootlegging via internet at that time.

After the Japan-wide release of &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, Monica was asked to substantially reconstruct the record with a host of new producers, and as a result she re-entered recording studios to start work with songwriters Kanye West, Jazze Pha, Andre &quot;mrDEYO&quot; Deyo, Bam &amp; Ryan and Dupri—replacing executive producer Missy Elliott. Released in June 2003, &quot;After the Storm&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with first-week sales of 185,500 copies. This was Monica&#x27;s first and only time reaching number-one on the chart. It eventually received a gold certification, and has sold 1,023,000 copies to date. Media reception of the CD was generally enthusiastic, with AllMusic saying the album &quot;has all the assuredness and smart developments that should keep Monica&#x27;s younger longtime followers behind her—all the while holding the ability to appeal to a wider spectrum of R&amp;B and hip-hop fans.&quot; The album&#x27;s lead single, Elliott-penned &quot;So Gone&quot;, was one of Monica&#x27;s biggest commercial successes in years, becoming her first top ten single since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Angel of Mine&quot;. In addition, it reached the top position of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Tracks and Hot Dance Club Play charts. Subsequently, &quot;After the Storm&quot; spawned another three singles, with final single &quot;U Should&#x27;ve Known Better&quot; reaching number nineteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

===2006–2010: &quot;The Makings of Me&quot;, &quot;Still Standing&quot;, and reality television===

Towards the end of 2006, Monica released her next studio album &quot;The Makings of Me&quot;. Titled after Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s recording &quot;The Makings of You&quot;, it saw her particularly reuniting with producers Elliott, Dupri, and Bryan Michael Cox; they had previously contributed to &quot;After the Storm&quot;. The album received a positive reception from most professional music critics, with AllMusic calling it a &quot;concise and mostly sweet set of songs&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; declaring it &quot;a solid addition&quot; to Monica&#x27;s discography. While it debuted at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop albums chart, and at number eight on the official &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it widely failed to revive the success of its predecessors. Singles such as snap-influenced &quot;Everytime tha Beat Drop&quot; featuring Atlanta hip-hop group Dem Franchize Boyz and Elliott-produced &quot;A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)&quot; failed to reach the top forty of the regular pop charts. Also in 2006, she made a cameo appearance in the American comedy-drama film &quot;ATL&quot;, playing the Waffle House waitress.

In August 2008, Monica appeared in the Peachtree TV reality show special &quot;Monica: The Single&quot;, which tracked the recording of the song &quot;Still Standing&quot; for her same-titled sixth studio album. The following year, she lent her voice to the ballad &quot;Trust&quot;, a duet with Keyshia Cole, that peaked in the top five on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and joined the cast of Rockmond Dunbar&#x27;s drama film &quot;Pastor Brown&quot;. In 2010, with the success of the 2008 one-hour special, Monica joined the production of the BET network for her own series &quot;&quot;, producing a spin-off her Peachtree show, containing the same concept. It focused on finding a hit single for the album&#x27;s release while balancing her personal life as a full-time mother and dealing with her troubled past. The premiere and encore episode garnered 3.2 million total viewers, while the show itself was made the second-highest series debut in BET history behind the debut of &quot;Tiny &amp; Toya&quot;, and was given a B rating by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

Featuring production by Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Polow da Don, &quot;Still Standing&quot; was released in March 2010 and garnered a generally positive response by critics, who perceived its sound as &quot;a return to the mid-&#x27;90s heyday&quot; of contemporary R&amp;B. The album debuted atop on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop albums chart, and number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with opening week sales of 184,000 copies, becoming her highest-charting album in years. Lead single &quot;Everything to Me&quot; scored Monica her biggest chart success since 2003&#x27;s &quot;So Gone&quot;, reaching the top position of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Tracks charts for seven weeks. The album was certified gold by the RIAA with domestic shipments of 500,000 copies within a single month. With it success, the album and &quot;Everything to Me&quot; were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance, presented at the 53rd Grammy Awards. Monica met future husband and NBA player Shannon Brown in June 2010 when they shot the music video for her second single &quot;Love All Over Me&quot;. Also in 2010, Monica joined Trey Songz on his Passion, Pain &amp; Pleasure Tour, her first North American concert tour in ten years.

===2011–2016: &quot;New Life&quot; and &quot;Code Red&quot;===

In 2011, Monica joined the debut season of the reality talent show &quot;The Voice&quot; as an adviser to musician coach Cee Lo Green. In April 2012, her seventh studio album, &quot;New Life&quot;, was released. It marked her first release with RCA, following its absorption of J Records in October 2011. Reception for the album was generally mixed; AllMusic complimented the album&#x27;s &quot;saucy, spirited, and soulful vibe&quot; while Adam Markovitz of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; criticized its &quot;cheesy choruses and outdated tunes&quot;. Commercially, &quot;New Life&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number two on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album spawned two preview singles, &quot;Anything (To Find You)&quot; and &quot;Until It&#x27;s Gone&quot;, both of which peaked in the top 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Lead single &quot;It All Belongs to Me&quot;, another duet with singer Brandy, charted similarly, reaching number 23 on the same chart. The same year, Monica along with Fred Hammond was featured on gospel music recording artist James Fortune and FIYA&#x27;s single &quot;Hold On&quot; which became a top five hit on the Christian Songs chart and garnered a Grammy Award nomination for Best Gospel Song at the 54th awards ceremony.

In October 2013, Monica appeared on the soundtrack of Malcolm D. Lee&#x27;s Christmas comedy-drama &quot;The Best Man Holiday&quot; with her Jermaine Dupri-produced rendition of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;. In December 2015, her eighth studio album &quot;Code Red&quot; was released. Upon its release, the album received generally mixed reviews from most music critics, and debuted at number 27 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Leading single &quot;Just Right for Me&quot;, a collaboration with Lil Wayne, reached number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult R&amp;B Songs chart but failed to impact elsewhere, resulting in lackluster sales in general and the release of no further singles. In support of the album, Monica embarked on her first solo concert tour in years, The &quot;Code Red&quot; Experience to promote &quot;Code Red&quot;. In November 2016, Monica announced her departure from RCA Records after only four years with the label.

===2018–present: New music and &quot;Verzuz&quot;===
In December 2018, Monica released the ballad &quot;Be Human&quot; to introduce The Be Human Foundation, a non profit organization founded by herself. The same month, she previewed music from her ninth studio album &quot;Trenches&quot; when she appeared on the seventh season of the VH1 reality series &quot;T.I. &amp; Tiny: The Family Hustle&quot;. In January 2019, she released &quot;Commitment,&quot; the first single on her own label, Mondeenise Music. A sleeper hit, &quot;Commitment&quot; reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult R&amp;B Songs in the week ending July 21, 2019, becoming her first chart topper in nine years. This was followed by the release of &quot;Me + You&quot; in April 2019 and title track &quot;Trenches&quot; featuring Lil Baby in August 2020. The release of &quot;Trenches&quot; coincided with Monica and Brandy&#x27;s appearances on the webcast battle series &quot;Verzuz&quot; which took place on August 31, at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta. At least 1.2 million people tuned in for the battle.

In October 2020, Monica was featured on the single &quot;Pink&quot; alongside Dolly Parton, Jordin Sparks, Sara Evans and Rita Wilson. The single was released in aid of Breast Cancer Research.

On July 15, 2022, Monica released the single, &quot;Friends&quot;, featuring Ty Dolla Sign. The song became her first top forty hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart in three years. In 2023, she reteamed with singer James Fortune on the duet &quot;Trusting God&quot;. Released as a single by Fortune&#x27;s FIYA World Entertainment on March 3, 2023, it reached the top 30 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Gospel Songs chart. &quot;Letters&quot;, another single, was released through Mondeenise Music on June 30, 2023. The song was co-written by Ciara and the video, released the same day and directed by Richard Selvi, features the Game as Monica&#x27;s love interest. In December 2023, Monica appeared alongside Nicki Minaj and Keyshia Cole on the song &quot;Love Me Enough&quot; from the &quot;Gag City&quot; deluxe version of Minaj&#x27;s album &quot;Pink Friday 2&quot;.

On June 21, 2024, Ariana Grande released &quot;The Boy Is Mine (Remix)&quot;, which features both Monica and Brandy. In late July, the singer resigned with WMA agency in partnership with her production company MonDeenise Productions. Formerly titled &quot;Trenches&quot;, her R&amp;B album &quot;MDA&quot; as well as her country album &quot;Open Road&quot; executive produced by country singer Brandi Carlile are set for release later this year.

==Artistry and influences==
Monica possesses an alto vocal range, which &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Erika Ramirez described as &quot;impeccable&quot;. Elysa Gardner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; likened her &quot;husky, dramatic alto&quot; to that of singer Toni Braxton. Writing that the singer arguably possesses &quot;the best alto of her generation&quot;, &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Tyler Lewis said Monica has &quot;always been able to elevate even the most generic material [...] with conviction and the sheer beauty of her voice&quot;, despite believing she uses &quot;a little too much vibrato at times&quot;.

Monica has said many times that Whitney Houston is her biggest inspiration and influence since childhood. Another big influence is Mary J. Blige. Other artists she looks up to are Betty Wright, Gladys Knight and Anita Baker.

==Personal life==
Monica&#x27;s career slowed down in 1999 due to problems in her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems&#x27;s brother, who had died in an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998. Weems then, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. &quot;Afterward, I felt, &#x27;What else could I have done?&#x27; You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: &#x27;Maybe if I had said this, or if I would have done that&#x27;&quot;, Monica said in an interview with the Associated Press in 2003. &quot;It&#x27;s just something that it&#x27;s never possible for me to go back and change.&quot; Monica briefly dated rapper, C-Murder, until he was incarcerated for a murder in 2003.

Monica met rapper Rodney &quot;Rocko&quot; Hill, a former SWA officer and real estate manager, shortly after Weems&#x27;s suicide, a time which she described as her &quot;weakest&quot;. While the pair soon began dating in the fall of the same year, they ended their relationship in 2004. A few months later, Monica and Hill reunited and she became pregnant with their first child. On May 21, 2005, she gave birth to their son, Rodney, who performs under &quot;Rodneyy&quot; as a SoundCloud rapper. Monica and Hill 
then became engaged on Christmas Eve 2007, shortly before the birth of their second child, named Romelo Montez Hill after Monica&#x27;s younger brother, on January 8, 2008. The couple split in early 2010.

In June 2010, Monica met NBA player Shannon Brown while she was looking for someone to play the love interest in her video for the song &quot;Love All Over Me&quot;. In October 2010, she announced her engagement to Brown via her Twitter account, posting a photo of a rose-cut diamond ring. On November 22, 2010, the couple married in a secret ceremony at their Los Angeles home. Their wedding, however, did not become a matter of public record until January 21, 2011, when Brown told the &quot;Hip-Hop Non-Stop TV-Show&quot;. A second wedding ceremony was held for family and friends to attend in July 2011. On September 3, 2013, Monica gave birth to her third child, Laiyah Shannon Brown. After eight years of marriage, Monica filed for divorce from Brown in March 2019. In October 2019, their divorce was finalized.

<doc id="217002" wikidata="Q262548" url="?curid=217002" title="Arsenal tube station">
<text>Arsenal is a London Underground station located in Highbury, London. It is on the Piccadilly line, between Holloway Road and Finsbury Park stations, in Travelcard Zone 2. Originally known as Gillespie Road, it was renamed in 1932 after Arsenal Football Club, who at the time played at the nearby Highbury Stadium. It is the only tube station named directly after a football club. Although Highbury Stadium closed in 2006, the station retains its name and is still used by spectators attending matches at Arsenal&#x27;s nearby Emirates Stadium.

==Location==
The station is located on a narrow Victorian residential street, away from any main roads. It is also unusual in not having any bus routes pass its entrance, though routes 4, 19, 106 and 236 serve nearby Blackstock Road.

==History==

Arsenal tube station was opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR) as Gillespie Road on 15 December 1906. The GNP&amp;BR was later renamed the Piccadilly line after the consolidation and nationalisation of the Tube network as London Underground. The original station building and ticket hall were red terracotta-clad buildings designed by Leslie Green, similar to neighbouring stations such as Holloway Road and Caledonian Road.

At the time of Gillespie Road&#x27;s construction, it served a residential area and a local divinity college. In 1913, Arsenal F.C. moved from Woolwich to Highbury on the site of the college&#x27;s playing fields, and the club&#x27;s presence there eventually led to a campaign for a change of name. Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman was a particularly keen advocate, and on 31 October 1932 it was renamed Arsenal (Highbury Hill). The station was expanded in the 1930s, when the original station building was demolished and replaced by a wider building of a more modern design.

The suffix was dropped from the station&#x27;s name some time around 1960, giving the current name of Arsenal. The original tiled walls of the platforms still bear the Gillespie Road name, spelt out in large letters. In 2007, the station underwent a major upgrade; as part of this the wall tiling was completely restored, the floor resurfaced and an electronic Tannoy system was introduced.

==Station layout==
When it was first built, the station building was squeezed between residential properties on each side, occupying the width of just two terraced houses. Even after the surface building was rebuilt and widened in the early 1930s, with a further house being demolished, it has one of the narrowest frontages of any Underground station.

Unusually for a &quot;deep level&quot; tube station, Arsenal possesses neither escalators nor lifts. Instead, a sloping passageway leads down to the platforms. This is due to the tunnels being both relatively shallow at this point and situated some distance from the station entrance (being underneath the East Coast Main Line). There are short flights of stairs at both ends of the passageway, so the station is not wheelchair accessible. When the station was rebuilt in the early 1930s, an extra tunnel was dug to platform level from the main access passage in anticipation of increased traffic. This is now used to handle the large crowds on match days. The station has a &quot;tidal&quot; system unique on the Underground network, with a narrow section on one side divided from the main passageway by a full-height fence. The narrow section is used on match days for the lighter flow, according to time of day—for passengers catching trains before matches, or leaving the station afterwards.

==Usage==

The station is considerably less busy than other stations on the same stretch of line. In 2007 only 2,735,000 entries and exits were recorded, compared with Holloway Road&#x27;s 7,487,000 and Caledonian Road&#x27;s 5,333,000.

In 2006 Arsenal F.C. moved to a new stadium, the Emirates Stadium. The stadium is on the site of Ashburton Grove, a former industrial estate approximately west of Highbury, and marginally closer to Drayton Park (on the Northern City Line) and Holloway Road stations. However, Drayton Park is closed on match days due to its small platform size and infrequent service (before 2015 it had no weekend service at all), and trains do not stop at Holloway Road before and after matches to prevent overcrowding. Arsenal station meanwhile is still within easy walking distance of the new stadium&#x27;s main entrance and is recommended by the club for use on match days. The station thus still retains the &quot;Arsenal&quot; name and, along with Finsbury Park and Highbury &amp; Islington, is still used by many Arsenal supporters to get to matches.

As part of the commemoration of Arsenal F.C.&#x27;s move, a temporary mural was placed along the walls of the station passageways as part of London Underground&#x27;s Art on the Underground scheme. It was unveiled in February 2006 and removed in September.

==Services and connections==

Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 2–6 minutes between 06:22 and 00:19 in both directions.

No bus routes directly serve the station. However, London Bus routes 4, 19, 29, 91, 106, 153, 236, 253, 254 and 259 and night routes N19, N29, N91, N253 and N279 are all nearby.

<doc id="217003" wikidata="Q366499" url="?curid=217003" title="Orcagna">
<text>Andrea di Cione di Arcangelo (c. 1308 – 25 August 1368), better known as Orcagna, was an Italian painter, sculptor, and architect active in Florence. He worked as a consultant at the Florence Cathedral and supervised the construction of the façade at the Orvieto Cathedral. His &quot;Strozzi Altarpiece&quot; (1354–57) is noted as defining a new role for Christ as a source of Catholic doctrine and papal authority.

==Works==
Orcagna&#x27;s works include:

* &quot;Altarpiece of the Redeemer&quot; (1354–57) in the &quot;Strozzi di Mantova&quot; Chapel at Santa Maria Novella, Florence
* The tabernacle in Orsanmichele (finished 1359) which was regarded as &quot;the most perfect work of its kind in Italian Gothic&quot;.
* His fresco &quot;The Triumph of Death&quot; inspired Franz Liszt&#x27;s masterwork &quot;Totentanz&quot;. 
* His fresco &quot;Crucifixion&quot; with a multitude of angels surrounding the cross, portrayed on a dark background and a few fragments of the Last Supper (1365).

The mosaic decoration and the rose window of the cathedral of Orvieto is attributed to Orcagna, who had become Master of the Works in 1359.

==Pupils==
Among Orcagna&#x27;s pupils and legacy were:
*Nello di Vanni, a Pisan painter of the 14th century, who also worked for the Campo Santo. Nello di Vanni is conjectured to be identical with Bernardo Nello or Giovanni Falcone.
*Tommaso del Mazza, called Tomasso di Marco by Giorgio Vasari
*Jacopo di Cione, brother of Andrea and mainly sculptor and architect

<text>The mobile submarine simulator (MOSS) MK70 is a sonar decoy used by submarines of the United States Navy. It was a 10-inch vehicle, without an explosive warhead, but able to generate both an active sonar echo and a passive sound signature recorded to be extremely similar to that of the launching submarine. The purpose of MOSS was to create multiple targets all with the same acoustic signature.

MOSS was originally developed by Gould until Westinghouse acquired that division. Some current underwater training targets are modeled after MOSS&#x27;s design.

The MOSS first entered service in 1976 and was deployed on all American ballistic missile submarines from the 1980s until it was withdrawn in the mid 1990s.

<text>The Washington Blade is an LGBT newspaper in the Washington metropolitan area. The &quot;Blade&quot; is the oldest LGBT newspaper in the United States and third largest by circulation, behind the &quot;Philadelphia Gay News&quot; and the &quot;Gay City News&quot; of New York City. The &quot;Blade&quot; is often referred to as America&#x27;s gay newspaper of record because it chronicled LGBT news locally, nationally, and internationally. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the &quot;Blade&quot; is considered &quot;one of the most influential publications written for a gay audience.&quot;

The paper was originally launched as an independent publication in October 1969 with a focus on bringing the community together. In 2001, the &quot;Blade&quot; was purchased by Window Media LLC, a group of gay-oriented newspapers circulated throughout the United States with a staff composed of professional journalists, becoming a leading source of news for the readers both in Washington and around the nation. The paper publishes weekly on Fridays and celebrated its 50th anniversary in October 2019.

In November 2009, the &quot;Blade&quot; and several related publications, including the &quot;Southern Voice&quot;, were shut down after Window Media announced it was closing business. After &quot;Blade&quot; staff members were told they no longer had jobs, plans were made for a new gay publication entitled DC Agenda, since the trademark for &quot;Washington Blade&quot; was still held by the now-defunct Window Media.

It was announced on April 27, 2010, that the &quot;DC Agenda&quot; would rename itself to the &quot;Washington Blade&quot;. The ownership group of the &quot;Agenda&quot; consisted of many former staff members of the &quot;Blade&quot;, who purchased the trademark and paper archives out of bankruptcy court. The first issue of the newly independent &quot;Blade&quot; debuted on April 30, 2010.

==History==
===Origins to 1973===
The &quot;Washington Blade,&quot; originally called The Gay Blade, published its first issue on October 5, 1969. Taking its roots from the Mattachine Society of Washington&#x27;s newsletter in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the &quot;Blade&quot; was conceived as a way to fill in a perceived gap in the organization of social communications within the gay community of Washington, D.C. It was created by Nancy Tucker and Lilli Vincenz. The &quot;Blade&quot; was originally published as a single page and distributed hand-to-hand in a variety of gay bars throughout the city. Afraid of a backlash over the publication, many of the initial authors of writings in the &quot;Blade&quot; used pen names during the early years of publishing. The initial publications were entirely created by volunteers from the community with two editors, Nancy Tucker and Bart Wenger, at the helm. Wenger stated the initial goals of the publication were to &quot;...engender a sense of community&quot; and that it was &quot;very important for gays to become acquainted with one another.&quot; Published monthly from 1969 to 1973, the newspaper evolved from its original size and shape of a single letter sized paper sheet. In June 1972, the &quot;Gay Blade&quot; published its first multi-page edition which consisted of four pages and in April 1973, the paper expanded to eight pages and was printed on legal sized paper sheets, stapled in the middle and folded. As the looks of the paper evolved, so did the news coverage. The &quot;Gay Blade&quot; began to focus less on being a newsletter used to organize the community and more of a newspaper for the community.

===1974 to 1982===
In July 1974, the first newsprint edition was published and signaled an evolution in the history of the &quot;Gay Blade.&quot; A fifth anniversary edition of the paper was not published in October 1974 because of a lack of revenue and interest, marking the only time the paper failed to publish an edition in its history. The new focus on being a newspaper allowed the publication&#x27;s circulation to grow in 1974 and 1975 from five hundred copies distributed at less than a dozen sites to over 4,000 copies available at thirty-five locations throughout the city. The June 1975 edition of the &quot;Blade&quot; dropped the word &#x27;Gay&#x27; from the title of the publication after it was discovered that a newspaper in New York City held the rights to the name &quot;Gay Blade.&quot; The new name of the publication was now &quot;The Blade.&quot; It continued to be published on newsprint paper and had no additional format changes until near the end of the decade. Incorporating as a non-profit corporation under the title of &quot;Blade Communications, Inc.&quot; in November 1975, the paper continued its growth. Don Michaels, an important voice on the pages of the publication, was named the editor of the paper in January 1978. Michaels began strict enforcement of a policy that prohibited pen names from being used in bylines. By November 1978, the &quot;Blade&quot; was regularly featuring color printing on its pages and beginning in 1979, the &quot;Blade&quot; changed into a bi-weekly publication. Starting in October 1980, the name of the publication changed to &quot;The Washington Blade&quot; and the corporation re-incorporated as a for-profit, employee-owned business. In July 1981, the &quot;Blade&quot; ran a front-page story entitled &quot;Rare, Fatal Pneumonia Hits Gay Men,&quot; making the paper one of the first gay newspapers in the country to write about the disease that has come to be known as AIDS. In November 1981, Don Michaels got promoted to the position of publisher, a position he would hold for over two decades.

===1983 to 2000===
The &quot;Blade&quot; started publishing weekly in January 1983 and coverage shifted to the AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease. The ever-breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources with members of the community having to step in to support the work of the &quot;Blade&quot;. The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the &quot;Washington Blade&quot;. In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the &quot;Blade,&quot; followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York Blade. In the later part of the century, coverage was expanded to include local and national news, as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community. Some authors implemented the use of humor in addressing potentially sensitive subjects, such as N. Leigh Dunlap in her long-running comic strip Morgan Calabrese.

===2001 to 2024===
On May 25, 2001, the print edition announced the sale of the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; to Window Media, LLC, a group of gay publications. With the new ownership came several changes to standardize the paper with other Window Media publications, such as the return of editorials to the publication after being missing for several decades. Shortly after the sale of the paper, staff at the &quot;Blade&quot; sought a vote to unionize with the help of the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild. The Guild and the staff of the &quot;Blade&quot; brought a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board and deliberated for a few weeks over this issue resulting in a ten to eight vote against unionization on July 20, 2001.

Beginning in 2005, the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; also ran a free news clipping service called the BladeWire. This service collected news stories of interest to the LGBT community from a variety of local, state, regional, national, and selected international media sources. The service was generated by the &quot;Blade&quot;s editors and was published on the internet. A feature of the &quot;BladeWire&quot; also allowed it to be syndicated onto other websites using JavaScript.

During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Senator John McCain&#x27;s decision to participate in a written interview with the &quot;Blade&quot; marked the first time a Republican presidential nominee agreed to be interviewed by a gay publication.

On November 16, 2009, the paper was abruptly shut down because of the financial status of its parent company, Window Media, and its majority shareholder, Avalon Equity Partners. Employees at the &quot;Blade&quot; were aware of Window Media&#x27;s financial troubles, but the timing and total closure of the publication came as a shock to the entire staff. Kevin Naff, editor of the &quot;Blade&quot;, said employees &quot;found out when two of the corporate officers were waiting for us when we got to work this morning&quot;. Since the &quot;Blade&quot; had been a profitable newspaper, and because the debt-ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication&#x27;s finances, the same day the &quot;Blade&quot; shut down, Naff told the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot; he and the remaining staffers &quot;We&#x27;re all together. Our first meeting for our new venture is tomorrow morning.&quot; Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said the &quot;Blade&quot; had been a &quot;weekly must-read&quot;, and pledged support for a new publication to serve Washington&#x27;s LGBT community.

On November 20, 2009, a new venture, supported entirely by volunteering staff (who consisted of the majority of the &quot;Blade&quot; editorial staff, as well as a few others, at the time of its closing), launched with its first issue. Called &quot;DC Agenda&quot;, no relation to the non-profit organization of the same name, the new venture released the same week as the closing of the &quot;Blade&quot;. From the placeholder website SaveTheBlade.com:

Issues were handed out at Washington, D.C., Metro train stations, and an online copy was available at www.washingtonblade.com.

On February 25, 2010, &quot;DC Agenda&quot; acquired the assets of the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; from the US Bankruptcy Court. Included were the archives, name, trademarks, website, and fixtures from the Washington Blade offices. About a month later on April 26, 2010, the &quot;DC Agenda&quot; publisher announced that the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; name would return to the masthead of the paper with the &quot;DC Agenda&quot; becoming the name of the arts and entertainment section.

On March 24, 2017, the paper launched a version in Los Angeles, called the Los Angeles Blade.

On September 12, 2024, the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; became the first LGBTQ newspaper to be given an exclusive interview with a sitting U.S. president. Reporter Christopher Kane sat down with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office and discussed a wide range of topics.

==Circulation and demographics==
The &quot;Washington Blade&quot; was published weekly on Fridays with a circulation of 33,874 printed copies of each edition. News coverage focuses mainly on global and regional political issues concerning LGBT persons with additional coverage of entertainment and nightlife in the Washington, D.C. area. The masthead of the printed paper includes the slogan &quot;The gay and lesbian weekly of the national capital area since 1969&quot; and the online masthead proclaims &quot;All the news for your life. And your style.&quot; Distribution of the &quot;Blade&quot; includes locations throughout the Washington, D.C. area. Additional distribution points are located in Maryland, Virginia, and as far away as Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The newspaper is primarily distributed through free-standing newspaper boxes on street corners, newspaper racks at Metro stations, and in shops and restaurants. The main competition to the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; in Washington, D.C. is the weekly newsmagazine, &quot;Metro Weekly,&quot; and nationally the &quot;Bay Area Reporter&quot; of San Francisco. For a brief period starting in 1979, the &quot;Blade&quot; also had competition from &quot;Blacklight,&quot; the city&#x27;s first African-American gay monthly periodical. Archives of the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; were maintained at their Washington, D.C. offices and on Microfilm at the Microfilm Reading Room of the Library of Congress, and in the Alternative &amp; Underground Press Collections of ProQuest (formerly called UMI) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The newspaper is a member of the National Newspaper Association, the National Gay Newspaper Guild, and the Associated Press.

According to a survey conducted by Simmons Market Research in April 2000 for the &quot;Washington Blade,&quot; the median age of their readership was forty-one and 85% of their readers were between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-four years old. 92% of the readership is employed with 70% of the readers in professional and managerial jobs. The median income of readers was $57,200 per year, with median household income at $84,000. Overall, 79% of the &quot;Blade&quot; readership holds a college degree with 42% of the readers holding postgraduate degrees.

==Awards==
A series of articles from March 1985 and continuing for five months entitled &quot;When Pretending Stops,&quot; written by Lisa Keen, won local acclaim and awards for the coverage of the slow death of local lawyer Ray Engebretsen. This series of articles chronicled the impact of AIDS in the gay community and was ground-breaking coverage in Washington. In 1995, the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; won a Silver Gavel award from the American Bar Association for a four-part series of articles entitled &quot;Legal Challenges to Anti-Gay Initiatives&quot; which explored the legal consequences of anti-gay ballot initiatives and the constitutional challenges to them. In 2007, the paper won four Dateline Awards for Excellence in Local Journalism from the Society of Professional Journalists Washington, D.C., Pro Chapter.

==Criticism and controversy==

Publication of the paper has not been without controversy over the years. The news coverage from the early years to the mid-1980s was perceived by some as being &quot;white-washed&quot; for its lack of coverage of the gay African-American population located in Washington, D.C., a city where more than 70 percent of its residents were African-American. This led to the creation of the short-lived publication &quot;Blacklight&quot;, the city&#x27;s first African-American gay monthly periodical in August 1979, which attempted to compete with the &quot;Blade&quot;.

Coverage of the City Council special election in April 1991 garnered intensive criticism of biased coverage and led to calls for reforming the paper&#x27;s editorial board. In 1993, the &quot;Blade&quot; and its publishing company threatened to sue the Fairfax County Library over a potential ban on the distribution of the &quot;Blade&quot; at its branches. Also, the 2001 sale of the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; to Window Media, LLC led to intense criticism from former employees, editors, and media pundits of the consolidation of so many gay newspapers&#x27; editorial boards into the same company, leading to fears of homogenizing of content and editorial control. A former staff writer has also accused the paper of playing politics through the mandated use of the capitalized version of the word &#x27;Gay&#x27; in order to make a political statement.

The newspaper has been accused from time-to-time of forcing public figures out of the closet. This policy of &#x27;outing&#x27; individuals surfaced in 1996 during the debate over the Defense of Marriage Act, when the &quot;Blade&quot; and &quot;The Advocate&quot; were going to out Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Mark Foley. Neither publication did out either politician, and both publications later denied ever intending to out the Congressmen.

In later years, these accusations have resurfaced as Kevin Naff, current editor of the &quot;Blade&quot;, has accused &quot;The Washington Post&quot; of &#x27;straight-washing&#x27; stories about LGBT individuals. Naff wrote that &quot;When someone is described as &#x27;flamboyant,&#x27; &#x27;eccentric&#x27; or &#x27;a lifelong bachelor,&#x27; we know what&#x27;s being implied... Readers of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; had better hone their gaydar skills, because in story after story, the newsgathering behemoth either ignores questions of sexual orientation or employs endless winks and nods to convey what would be better spelled out.&quot; When asked why identifying and outing of individuals by publications like the &quot;Blade&quot;, staff writer Greg Marzullo wrote &quot;Why do [we] insist on mentioning someone&#x27;s sexual orientation at all? Because we&#x27;re a queer paper.&quot;

As reported in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, former editor Chris Crain summarized the &quot;Blade&quot; editorial reasoning for the &#x27;outings&#x27; by stating that &quot;It is 2004, not 1954, and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a &#x27;private fact&#x27; beyond the pale of inquiry.&quot; The &quot;Blade&quot;, he wrote, &quot;would investigate and report about whether influential Hill aides are gay if facts about their sexual orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in the stands taken by anti-gay members of Congress for whom they work.&quot; A former staff writer of the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; has noted objections to this perceived campaign to label individuals by their sexual orientations and has used a blog to register these objections.

In July 2005, Jeff Gannon began writing editorials for the paper. His pieces included criticism of gay blogger John Aravosis, who had helped uncover Gannon&#x27;s pornographic ads. Editor Chris Crain attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision, due to Gannon&#x27;s history of anti-gay reporting as well as Gannon&#x27;s refusal to disclose his sexual orientation. He has said, &quot;My personal life is a private matter, despite the fact that I have become a public person.&quot; Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial and claimed the &quot;steady stream of feedback/vitriol&quot; had declined &quot;a little&quot; with each new Gannon article.

<text>The GP32 (GamePark 32) is a handheld game console developed by the South Korean company Game Park. It was released on November 23, 2001, in South Korea and distributed in some parts of Europe.

==History==
The GP32 was shown at E3 in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. At one point, GamePark produced an unreleased unit with mobile phone functionality.

==Features==
The overall design is not unlike the original version of the Game Boy Advance. The GP32 is based on a 133 MHz ARM 9 CPU and 8 MB of SDRAM. Unlike other handheld gaming systems, which tend to be proprietary cartridge-based, the GP32 uses SmartMedia cards (SMC) for storing programs and data, making it accessible for amateur developers as no further development hardware is required.

The console has an eight-way microswitch based mini-joystick controller, two main buttons (&#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27;), two shoulder buttons on each side of the SMC slot (&#x27;L&#x27; and &#x27;R&#x27;) and two other menu buttons on each side of the screen (&#x27;SELECT&#x27; and &#x27;START&#x27;), made from a softer, translucent rubber. The console also has a USB 1.1 port for connection with a host computer, a serial expansion port, a 3.3 V power adapter input, a headphone connector and a rear compartment that holds two AA-sized batteries.

== Variants ==
There are three main commercial versions of the unit characterized by different display types. Commercial units are white in color with either grey or white buttons and trim. There are also a number of differently colored promotional units and several prototype units with different designs.

=== GP32 NLU ===
The original GP32 was the no-light unit (NLU) which relied on an external light source to view the screen.

=== GP32 FLU ===
In late 2002, Game Park introduced the frontlight unit (FLU) as a factory-modified (by Hahotech) version of the NLU. It provides its own illumination via a transparent panel between the LCD display and the plastic screen cover. The extra hardware resulted in a slightly raised display frame when compared to the NLU and BLU variants. The front light could be turned off with a switch mounted on the back of the GP32 case (to save battery).
The GP32 FLU&#x27;s name was derived from a sticker added to the front of the GP32 packaging differentiating it from the standard non-light versions.

=== GP32 BLU ===
In mid-2004, Game Park introduced the backlight unit (BLU). The new BLU LCD was compatible with the NLU (and FLU) and provided a superior screen display in poor lighting conditions. At the end of 2004, Game Park also released a second version of the BLU, which had a different LCD from the first version of BLU units. The new BLU+ LCD was not 100% compatible with the original LCD screen and so software required special handling to support both LCD versions.
The backlight could be disabled by holding the SELECT button for 5 seconds. The BLU models also had a slightly different USB port connector and better quality micro switches for the controller.

==Software==

===Built In===
The original Game Park firmware had three main functions: to launch applications, provide a means of linking to a host computer and play music in MP3 format.
Later versions of the Game Park firmware removed the MP3 music capability.

===Homebrew===
Game Park planned their system to be powerful and useful, but they also wanted users to be able to create homebrew software. GP32 users could register the unit on the official website and get a free suite of development tools to create their own programs. Game Park also allowed (under certain restrictions) the publishing of such homebrew games on their website.
The GP32&#x27;s original firmware only supported running encrypted games and tools. Users had to register and use an encrypted &quot;Free Launcher&quot; to run unsigned software. Alternative firmware removed the necessity of using the &quot;Free Launcher&quot; software and provided many extra functions that were lacking in the original firmware.

Through this strategy, the GP32 was the host of multiple homebrew applications and games. The various applications made for it ranged from alternative firmware, file managers, games, emulators, game generators (such as RPG Maker), a DivX player and image slideshows.

===Commercial===
Commercial games could be acquired via internet download (encrypted to the GP32&#x27;s ID) or in a retail box. The retail boxes contained SmartMedia Cards with the games which were encrypted to run only from these cards (SMC ID). They could alternatively be downloaded from a Korean portal after submitting the GP32&#x27;s ID, they were then encrypted to run only on that GP32. Downloading the games effectively reduced the cost to the consumer, who was no longer paying for the manufacture of the cartridge. Downloading a game online could range from US$10 to US$30.

===Games===

Five games in a variety of genres were released at the system&#x27;s launch on November 23, 2001. About 28 commercial games were eventually released. The last commercial game to be released was the platformer/RPG Blue Angelo, which was released on December 16, 2004. Most commercial GP32 games could be bought in two ways: boxed or downloaded through the internet through Gamepark&#x27;s online JoyGP store (typically for a much lower price). JoyGP was the international version of the MegaGP store, which existed earlier and was limited to South Korea. Although most games were sold in both formats, there were a few exceptions: for example, &quot;Blue Angelo&quot; was (and is) only sold as a boxed copy made in France, and &quot;Gloop Deluxe&quot; was only sold online, but not through JoyGP.

Although the number of official games available for the GP32 system is limited, many open source/free software developers worked on various emulators and ported PC games. In addition to this, a wide range of free, public domain games were created by amateur developers. Game Park did not ask any royalties to release games for its device, which made it easier for small editors or independent developers to release software for the GP32.

The modification of Ericsson Chatboard micro-keyboards to work with the system has seen a new flourish of software development, including countless attempts at ports of Linux, and keyboard support being added to many emulators.

===Emulators===
The GP32&#x27;s relatively powerful ARM 920T CPU and freely available &#x27;C&#x27;-based SDK have allowed many emulators to be specifically developed or ported from other platforms. Emulated systems that run on the GP32 include 16-bit era and earlier console and computer platforms. These emulators allow users to experience a large variety of games on their GP32 system, largely compensating for the relatively small library of commercially available games.
There is also a Windows-based GP32 emulator, which allows users to run GP32 software on a Windows-based PC.

==Commercial availability==
Commercially, the system can be found mostly in Korea, and some other parts of Asia. Although an initial European release was abandoned, the GP32 BLU model was released in three European markets, including Portugal, Spain, and Italy, being distributed by Virgin Play on June 15, 2004, with a price point of €199. There were official distributors in the United Kingdom and Sweden as well. Game Park, however, did not release the console in America.

Despite not being released worldwide, the GP32 has a large international community of users and developers. About 32,000 or 30,000 units were sold by the end of 2007.

<text>Green Bay is a city in and the county seat of Brown County, Wisconsin, United States. It is located at the head of Green Bay (known locally as &quot;the bay of Green Bay&quot;), a sub-basin of Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Fox River. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 107,395, making it the third-most populous city in Wisconsin, after Milwaukee and Madison, and the third-most populous city on Lake Michigan, after Chicago and Milwaukee.

Green Bay is the principal city of the Green Bay metropolitan area, which covers Brown, Kewaunee, and Oconto counties and had a population of 320,050 in 2020.

==History==

Samuel de Champlain, the founder of New France, commissioned Jean Nicolet to form a peaceful alliance with Native Americans in the western areas, whose unrest interfered with the French fur trade, and to search for a shorter trade route to China through Canada. Nicolet and others had learned from other First Nations of the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) people, who identified as &quot;People of the Sea&quot;, and believed they must reside on or near an Ocean. Champlain had also heard about natural resources in the area, including fertile soil, forests, and animals. Nicolet began his journey for this new land shortly before winter in 1634. In what later became a French fur-trading route, he sailed up the Ottawa River, through Lake Nipissing and down the French River to Lake Huron, then through the straits of Michilimackinac into Lake Michigan. He is believed to have landed at Red Banks, near the site of the modern-day city of Green Bay, Wisconsin.

=== From the trading post &quot;La Baie des Puants&quot; to the town &quot;La Baie verte&quot; ===

Nicolet founded a small trading post here in 1634, originally named &quot;La Baye&quot; or &quot;La Baie des Puants&quot; (French for &quot;the Bay of Stinking Waters&quot;). Nicolet&#x27;s settlement was one of the oldest European permanent settlements in America.

When Nicolet arrived in the Green Bay area, he encountered the Menominee, who occupied this territory. He also met the Ho-Chunk (also known as the Winnebago), a people who spoke a Siouan language.

The Winnebago hunted and fished, and also cultivated corn, beans, squash, and tobacco. Wild rice, which they had incorporated as a dietary staple, grew in abundance along the riverbanks. The women regularly harvested and cooked this, along with a wide variety of nuts, berries, and edible roots which they gathered in the woods. The men typically hunted and fished for food, and the women processed game and other foods in cooking. They prepared and made clothing from the furs, as well as using other parts of animals to make tools, cord, etc. Women also had a role in the political process, as no action could be taken without agreement of half of the women. Nicolet stayed with this tribe for about a year, becoming an ally. He helped open up opportunities for trade and commerce with them before returning to Quebec.

A few months after Nicolet returned to Quebec, Champlain died. His death halted other journeys to &quot;La Baie Verte&quot; (French for &quot;The Green Bay&quot;). Père Claude Allouez sent Nicolas Perrot to La Baie. After this, the French avoided the area for some decades, because of the intensity of First Nations and European conflicts in the east. In 1671, a Jesuit Mission was set up in the area. A fort was added in 1717 and gradually associated development took place. The town was incorporated in 1754.

Great Britain took control of some French areas during the Seven Years&#x27; War, known as the French and Indian War in some areas of North America. They took control of this town in 1761. After the British defeated the French in 1763, France ceded its lands east of the Mississippi in North America.

The first permanent settlers were Charles de Langlade and his family from Quebec, who moved to Green Bay in 1765. They are considered the first European settlers in the present-day state of Wisconsin. Langlade, called the &quot;Founder and Father of Wisconsin&quot;, was a &quot;métis&quot; or mixed-race, son of a French-Canadian father and an Ottawa woman. He grew up with his mother&#x27;s family among the Ottawa people and became a war chief. The Ottawa were allies of the French during the French and Indian War, and Langlade is credited with planning the ambush of British General Braddock and George Washington. His family was followed to Green Bay by the Grignons, Porliers and Lawes, who brought French-Canadian culture with them. Colorful &quot;jack-knife Judge&quot; Reaume dispensed British justice in the territory after Great Britain took it over following the war. These early ethnic French settlers set the tone for many who followed.

=== The British takeover ===

The British gradually took over Wisconsin during the French and Indian War, taking control of Green Bay in 1761 and gaining control of all of Wisconsin in 1763. Like the French, the British were interested in little but the fur trade. The first permanent settlers, mostly French Canadians, some Anglo-New Englanders and a few African American freedmen, arrived in Wisconsin while it was under British control. Charles Michel de Langlade is generally recognized as the first settler, establishing a trading post at Green Bay in 1745, and moving there permanently in 1764. Settlement began at Prairie du Chien around 1781. The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, referred to the town as &quot;La Bey,&quot; however British fur traders referred to it as &quot;Green Bay,&quot; because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring. The old French title was gradually dropped, and the British name of &quot;Green Bay&quot; stuck. The region coming under British rule had virtually no adverse effect on the French residents as the British needed the cooperation of the French fur traders and the French fur traders needed the goodwill of the British. During the French occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders, whereas the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region, issued licenses for fur trading freely, both to British and French residents. The fur trade in what is now Wisconsin reached its height under British rule, and the first self-sustaining farms in the state were established as well. From 1763 to 1780, Green Bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff, built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities. In 1791, two free African Americans set up a fur trading post among the Menominee at present day Marinette.

=== After independence ===

The Green Bay area was still under British control until the 1783 treaty formally ended the American Revolutionary War. Following the War of 1812, which in part was over disputes related to the border with Canada, the United States built Fort Howard on the Fox River in 1816 to protect its northern border. Doty, Whitney, Arndt, Baird and Martin were among the many British-American settlers whose numbers pushed French culture into the background.

The Erie Canal was completed in 1825, linking New England with the Great Lakes. This led to the advance of Green Bay as a trading center. The end of the Black Hawk War in 1832 also gave impetus to settlement of the region. Most of the settlers were farmers from New England who began using the Erie Canal to pour into Wisconsin. As more and more New England settlers arrived, Green Bay developed into a trading center for this population.

Wisconsin&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Green Bay Intelligencer&quot;, was started in 1833 by Albert Ellis and John V. Suydam. The borough of Green Bay, created in 1838, is the center of the present-day city. The borough combined the town of Astor (a company town of the American Fur Company) with Navarino, platted by Daniel Whitney. Before Wisconsin became a state in 1848, its commerce was based on the fur trade, which became dominated by John Jacob Astor&#x27;s American Fur Company. After statehood, there was a shift away from fur trading toward lumbering. &quot;For a short time in 1860s and 1870s, iron smelting in charcoal kilns rivaled the timber industry while the port handled increasing amounts of fuel, feed, and lumber. Today&#x27;s major local industry had its start in 1865 when the first paper mill was built.&quot;

By 1850 the town had a population of 1,923. The town was incorporated as the city of Green Bay in 1854. The Green Bay Area Public School District was founded in 1856. Throughout the 1850s, word spread of America&#x27;s cheap land and good soil, bringing in an influx of Belgian people, German, Scandinavian, Irish and Dutch immigrants, each adding to the culture. The greatest concentration of newcomers came from Belgium. They cleared the land to farm and build their homes.

The railroad arrived in the 1860s. The three railroads that would reach Green Bay were the Chicago &amp; North Western (C&amp;NW), SOO Line, (SOO), and the Milwaukee Road (MILW). These railroads were highways which allowed people and products to travel all over the state, increasing business and trade opportunities. The area was able to grow and enrich itself with the use of the plentiful timber resources. This led to the paper industry becoming the major employer in Green Bay, and opened up the port for international trade.

Large numbers of Belgians immigrated to Green Bay in the thirty-year period between 1880 and 1910. Significant numbers of English immigrants, many having lived first in Canada, also moved to Green Bay during this period, usually arriving as large families. There was also a small Dutch community in Green Bay at this time. Green Bay had a larger portion of first generation immigrants from France than any other city in Wisconsin at this time as well.

In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to Green Bay to honor its tercentenary. By 1950, the city had a population of 52,735. In 1964, the Town of Preble was consolidated with the city of Green Bay.

==Geography==
Green Bay is in the eastern part of Wisconsin at the mouth of the Fox River. Today, Interstate 43 meets Interstate 41 (also U.S. Route 41) in Green Bay, approximately north of Milwaukee.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

About 14% of the city of Green Bay is inside the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin reservation.

===Climate===

Green Bay has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), with some moderation due to the city&#x27;s proximity to Lake Michigan. Like other cities with this type of climate, there are four distinct seasons, often with severe or extreme variation between them in terms of temperature and precipitation. Green Bay experiences warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. The variance in temperature and precipitation between months is severe and often extreme. Tornadoes are rare in the Green Bay area, with the strongest being an F3 tornado that hit the community of Pittsfield on June 26, 1969.

Monthly mean temperatures range from in January to in July. In July, the warmest month, the average high temperature is . There are 6.1 days of + highs, 68 days where the high remains at or below freezing, and 19 days with sub- lows annually. From December to February, even during thaws, the temperature rarely reaches . Extremes have ranged from on January 21, 1888, to on July 13, 1936.

The wettest month in Green Bay is August, when of precipitation falls, mostly in the form of rainfall from thunderstorms. The driest month in Green Bay is February, when the majority of precipitation falls as low moisture-content snow due to cold, dry air. On average, of precipitation falls in February.

<text>Santa Maria Novella is a church in Florence, Italy, situated opposite, and lending its name to, the city&#x27;s main railway station. Chronologically, it is the first great basilica in Florence, and is the city&#x27;s principal Dominican church.

The church, the adjoining cloister, and chapter house contain a multiplicity of art treasures and funerary monuments. Especially famous are frescoes by masters of Gothic and early Renaissance. They were financed by the most important Florentine families, who ensured themselves funerary chapels on consecrated ground.

==History==

This church was called S. Maria Novella (&#x27;New&#x27;) because it was built on the site of the 9th-century oratory of Santa Maria delle Vigne. When the site was assigned to the Dominican Order in 1221, they decided to build a new church and adjoining cloister. The church was designed by two Dominican friars, Fra Sisto Fiorentino and Fra Ristoro da Campi. Building began in the mid-13th century (about 1276), and lasted 80 years, ending under the supervision of Friar Iacopo Talenti with the completion of the Romanesque-Gothic bell tower and sacristy. In 1360, a series of Gothic arcades were added to the façade; these were intended to contain sarcophagi. The church was consecrated in 1420.
On a commission from the wealthy Florentine wool merchant Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, Leon Battista Alberti designed the upper part of the inlaid green marble of Prato, also called &#x27;serpentino&#x27;, and white marble façade of the church (1456–1470). He was already famous as the architect of the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, but even more for his seminal treatise on architecture . Alberti had also designed the façade for the Rucellai Palace in Florence.

Alberti attempted to bring the ideals of humanist architecture, proportion and classically inspired detailing to bear on the design, while also creating harmony with the already existing medieval part of the façade. The combined façade can be inscribed by a square; many other repetitions of squares can be found in the design. His contribution consists of a broad frieze decorated with squares, and the full upper part, including the four white-green pilasters and a round window, crowned by a pediment with the Dominican solar emblem, and flanked on both sides by enormous S-curved volutes.
The four columns with Corinthian capitals on the lower part of the façade were also added. The pediment and the frieze are clearly inspired by antiquity, but the S-curved scrolls in the upper part are new and without precedent in antiquity. Solving a longstanding architectural problem of how to transfer from wide to narrow storeys, the scrolls (or variations of them), found in churches all over Italy, all draw their origins from the design of this church.

The frieze below the pediment carries the name of the patron: (&#x27;Giovanni Rucellai son of Paolo in the year of salvation 1470&#x27;).

==Interior==
The vast interior is based on a basilica plan, designed as an Egyptian cross (T-shaped) and is divided into a nave, two aisles set with windows and a short transept. The large nave is 100 metres long and gives an impression of austerity. The piers are of compound form and have Corinthian columns supporting pointed Gothic arches above which is a clerestory of ocular windows above which rises a ribbed, pointed quadrupartite vault. The ribs and arches are all black and white polychrome.

There is a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; effect by which towards the apse the nave seems longer than its actual length because the piers between the nave and the aisles are progressively closer, nearer to the chancel.

Many of the windows have stained glass dating from the 14th and 15th century, such as 15th century &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; and St. John and St. Philip (designed by Filippino Lippi), both in the Filippo Strozzi Chapel. Some stained glass windows have been damaged in the course of centuries and have been replaced. The one at the west end, a depiction of the &quot;Coronation of Mary&quot;, dates from the 14th century, and is based on a design of Andrea di Bonaiuto da Firenze.

The pulpit, commissioned by the Rucellai family in 1443, was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi and executed by his adopted son Andrea Cavalcanti. This pulpit has a particular historical significance, since it was the pulpit from which Father Tommaso Caccini denounced Galileo Galilei&#x27;s defense of Copernican heliocentrism.

&quot;The Holy Trinity&quot;, situated almost halfway along the left aisle, is a pioneering early Renaissance work of Masaccio, showing his new ideas about perspective and mathematical proportions. Its meaning for the art of painting can easily be compared to the importance of Brunelleschi for architecture and Donatello for sculpture. The patrons were the judge and his wife, members of the Lenzi family, here depicted kneeling. The cadaver tomb below carries in Italian the epigram: &quot;I was once what you are, and what I am you will become&quot;.

Of particular note in the right aisle is the &quot;Tomba della Beata Villana&quot;, a monument by Bernardo Rossellino executed in 1451. In the same aisle, are located tombs of bishops of Fiesole, one by Tino di Camaino and another by Nino Pisano.

===Tornabuoni Chapel===

The chancel (or the Cappella Tornabuoni) contains series of famous frescoes painted from 1485 to 1490 by Domenico Ghirlandaio whose apprentice was the young Michelangelo. The frescoes represent themes from the lives of the Virgin and John the Baptist. They contain portrayals of several members of important Florentine families. The vaults have roundels with paintings of the Evangelists. On the rear wall are the paintings &quot;Saint Dominic burns the Heretical Books&quot; and &quot;Saint Peter&#x27;s Martyrdom&quot;, the &quot;Annunciation&quot;, and &quot;Saint John goes into the Desert&quot;.

The stained-glass windows were made in 1492 by the Florentine artist Alessandro Agolanti, known also as Il Bidello, and were based on cartoons by Ghirlandaio.

The bronze crucifix on the main altar is by Giambologna (16th century).

===Filippo Strozzi Chapel===
The Filippo Strozzi Chapel is situated on the right side of the main altar. The series of frescoes by Filippino Lippi depict the lives of Apostle Philip and the Apostle Saint James the Great and were completed in 1502. On the right wall is the fresco &quot;St Philip Driving the Dragon from the Temple of Hieropolis&quot; and in the lunette above it, the &quot;Crucifixion of St Philip&quot;. On the left wall is the fresco &quot;St John the Evangelist Resuscitating Druisana&quot; and in the lunette above it &quot;The Torture of St John the Evangelist&quot;. Adam, Noah, Abraham and Jacob are represented on the ribbed vault. Behind the altar is the tomb of Strozzi with a sculpture by Benedetto da Maiano (1491).

===Gondi Chapel===

This chapel, designed by Giuliano da Sangallo, is situated on the left side of the main altar and dates from the end of the 13th century. Here, on the rear wall, is the famous wooden &quot;Crucifix&quot; by Brunelleschi, one of his very few sculptures. The legend goes that he was so disgusted by the &quot;primitive&quot; Crucifix of Donatello in the Florence&#x27;s church of Santa Croce that he made this one. The vault contains fragments of frescoes by 13th-century Greek painters. The polychrome marble decoration was applied by Giuliano da Sangallo (c. 1503). The stained-glass window and dates from the 20th century.

===Cappella Strozzi di Mantova===
The Cappella Strozzi di Mantova is situated at the end of the left transept. The frescoes were commissioned from Nardo di Cione (1350–1357) by Tommaso Strozzi, an ancestor of Filippo Strozzi. The frescoes are inspired by Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;: Last Judgment (on the back wall; including a portrait of Dante), Hell (on the right wall) and paradise (on the left wall). The main altarpiece of &quot;The Redeemer with the Madonna and Saints&quot; was done by Nardo di Cione&#x27;s brother, Andrea di Cione, better known as Orcagna. The large stained-glass window on the back was made from a cartoon by the two brothers.

===Della Pura Chapel===
The Della Pura Chapel is situated north of the old cemetery. It dates from 1474 and was constructed with Renaissance columns. It was restored in 1841 by Gaetano Baccani. On the left side there is a lunette with a 14th-century fresco &quot;Madonna and Child with St Catherine&quot;. On the front altar there is a wooden crucifix by Baccio da Montelupo (1501).

===Rucellai Chapel===
The Rucellai Chapel, at the end of the right aisle, dates from the 14th century. Besides the tomb of Paolo Rucellai (15th century) and the marble statue of the &quot;Madonna and the Child&quot; by Nino Pisano, it houses several art treasures such as remains of frescoes by the Maestro di Santa Cecilia (end 13th – beginning 14th century). The panel on the left wall, &quot;the Martyrdom of St Catherine&quot;, was painted by Giuliano Bugiardini (possibly with assistance from Michelangelo). The bronze tomb, in the centre of the floor, was made by Lorenzo Ghiberti in 1425.

===Bardi Chapel===
The Bardi Chapel, the second chapel on the right of the apse, was founded by Riccardo Bardi and dates from early 14th century. The high-relief on a pillar on the right depicts &quot;St Gregory blessing Riccardo Bardi&quot;. The walls show us some early 14th-century frescoes attributed to Spinello Aretino. The &quot;Madonna del Rosario&quot; on the altar is by Giorgio Vasari (1568)

===Sacristy===
The sacristy, at the end of the left aisle, was built as the Chapel of the Annunciation by the Cavalcanti family in 1380. It houses, after a recent period of fourteen years of cleaning and renovation, the enormous painted &quot;Crucifix with the Madonna and John the Evangelist&quot;, an early work by Giotto. The sacristy is also embellished by a glazed terra cotta and a marble font, masterpieces by Giovanni della Robbia (1498). The cupboards were designed by Bernardo Buontalenti in 1593. The paintings on the wall are ascribed to Vasari and other contemporary Florentine painters. The large Gothic window with three mullions at the back wall dates from 1386 and was based on cartoons by Niccolò di Pietro Gerini

===Spanish Chapel===

The Spanish Chapel (or &quot;Cappellone degli Spagnoli&quot;) is the former chapter house of the convent. It is situated at the north side of the green Cloister (&quot;Chiostro Verde&quot;). It was commissioned by Buonamico (Mico) Guidalotti as a chapter house for the Dominican Order. Construction started c. 1343 and was finished in 1355. The Guidalotti chapel was later called &quot;Spanish Chapel&quot;, because Cosimo I assigned it to Eleonora of Toledo and her Spanish retinue. Within the Spanish Chapel there is a smaller Chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament.

The Spanish Chapel was decorated from 1365 to 1367 by Andrea di Bonaiuto, also known as Andrea da Firenze. As the chapel was built for the Dominicans, depictions of Saint Dominic are found in most of the frescos. The large fresco on the right wall depicts an &quot;Allegory of the Active and Triumphant Church and of the Dominican order&quot;. It is especially interesting because in the background it shows a large pink building that some think may provide some insight into the original designs for Florence Cathedral by Arnolfo di Cambio (before Brunelleschi&#x27;s dome was built). However, such an interpretation is fantasy since the Duomo was never intended to be pink, nor to have the bell tower at the rear. This fresco also contains portraits of pope Benedict IX, cardinal Friar Niccolò Albertini, count Guido di Poppi, Arnolfo di Cambio and the poet Petrarch.

The frescoes on the other walls represent scenes from the lives of Christ and St Peter on the entry wall (mostly ruined due to the later installation of a choir), &quot;The Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas&quot; and the &quot;Allegory of Christian Learning&quot; on the left wall, and the large &quot;Crucifixion with the Way to Calvary and the Descent into Limbo&quot; on the archway of the altar wall.

The four-part vault contains scenes of Christ&#x27;s resurrection, the navicella, the Ascension, and Pentecost. The five-panelled Gothic polyptych that was probably originally made for the chapel&#x27;s altar, depicting the &quot;Madonna Enthroned with Child and Four Saints&quot; by Bernardo Daddi dates from 1344 and is currently on display in a small museum area reached ed through glass doors from the far end of the cloister. Together, the complex iconography of the ceiling vault, walls, and altar combine to communicate the message of Dominicans as guides to salvation.

Rectangular in shape, towards the west it has a scarsella containing the altar and a marble crucifix by Domenico Pieratti from the early seventeenth century, donated in 1731 by Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici.

===Architecture===

Vasari was the architect, commissioned in 1567 by Grand Duke Cosimo I, for the first remodelling of the church, which included removing its original rood screen and loft, and adding six chapels between the columns. The second remodelling was designed by Enrico Romoli, and was carried out between 1858 and 1860.

The square in front the church was used by Cosimo I for the yearly chariot race (&quot;Palio dei Cocchi&quot;). This custom existed between 1563 and late in the 19th century. The two Obelisks of the Corsa dei Cocchi marked the start and the finish of the race. They were set up to imitate an antique Roman Circus Maximus. The obelisks rest on bronze tortoises, made in 1608 by the sculptor Giambologna.

===Astronomical Instruments===
An armillary sphere (on the left) and an astronomical quadrant with gnomon (on the right) were added to the end blind arches of the lower façade by Ignazio Danti, astronomer of Cosimo I, in 1572. The armilliary sphere was intended to determine the vernal equinox and this was observed for the first time publicly in 1574. The gnomon threw shadows on the astronomical quadrant to tell the time according to the transalpine, Italian and Bohemian methods.

Thanks to these instruments, the astronomer was able to calculate exactly the discrepancy between the true solar year and the Julian calendar, then still in use since its promulgation in 46 BC. By demonstrating his studies in Rome to Pope Gregory XIII, he helped obtain the realignment of the date of Easter and the promulgation of the new Gregorian calendar. 
Danti also placed a hole in the south facing circular window at a height of and installed a meridian line on the floor of the church as a better method of determining the equinoxes than the armilliary sphere. However, the construction was not completed due to the death of his patron, the Grand Duke Cosimo I.

<text>Cryptome is an online library and 501(c)(3) private foundation created in 1996 by John Young and Deborah Natsios closed in 2023 and reopened soon afterward. The site collected information about freedom of expression, privacy, cryptography, dual-use technologies, national security, intelligence, and government secrecy. 

Cryptome was known for publishing the alleged identities of people associated with the CIA, the Stasi, and the PSIA and British intelligence. Cryptome was one of the early organizers of WikiLeaks and published the alleged internal emails of the WikiLeaks organization. Cryptome republished the already public surveillance disclosures of Edward Snowden and claimed in June 2014 that they would publish all unreleased Snowden documents later that month.

Cryptome has received praise from organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), but has also been the subject of criticism and controversy. WikiLeaks has accused Cryptome of forging emails and some of Cryptome&#x27;s posted documents have been called an &quot;invitation to terrorists.&quot; The website has also been criticized for posting maps and pictures of &quot;dangerous Achilles&#x27; heel[s] in the domestic infrastructure,&quot; which &quot;The New York Times&quot; called a &quot;tip off [to] terrorists.&quot; ABC News also criticized them for posting information that terrorists could use to plan attacks. They continued to post controversial materials including guides on &quot;how to attack critical infrastructure&quot; in addition to other instructions for illegal hacking &quot;for those without the patience to wait for whistleblowers&quot;. Cryptome has also received criticism for its handling of embarrassing and private information.

==People==

===John Young===

John Young was born in 1935. He grew up in West Texas where his father worked in the oil field, construction and on a decommissioned Texas POW camp, and Young later served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Germany (1953–1956) and earned degrees in philosophy and architecture from Rice University (1957–1963) and his graduate degree in architecture from Columbia University in 1969. A self-identified radical, he became an activist and helped create community service group Urban Deadline, where his fellow student-activists initially suspected him of being a police spy. Urban Deadline went on to receive citations from the Citizens Union of the City of New York and the New York City Council, and which later evolved into Cryptome. His work earned him a position on the nominating committee for the Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design in 1998.

He has received citations from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Legal Aid Society. In 1993, he was awarded the Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition. He has stated he doesn&#x27;t &quot;acknowledge the power of the law.&quot;

===Deborah Natsios===

Deborah Natsios grew up in CIA safe houses across Europe, Asia and South America reserved for covert CIA station chiefs. She later received her graduate degree in architecture from Princeton University. She has taught architecture and urban design at Columbia University and Parsons The New School for Design, and held seminars at the Pratt Institute and the University of Texas. She is the principal of Natsios Young Architects.

In addition to being co-editor for Cryptome, she is responsible for the associated project Cartome, which was founded in 2011 and posts her original critical art and graphical images and other public resources to document sensitive areas. She additionally holds a degree in mathematics from Smith College. She has given talks at the USENIX Annual Technical Conference and Architectures of Fear: Terrorism and the Future of Urbanism in the West, and written on topics ranging from architectural theory to defenses of Jim Bell and assassination politics. She is a notable critic of Edward Snowden.

====Family====
Natsios is the daughter of Nicholas Natsios, who served as CIA station chief in Greece from 1948–1956, in Vietnam from 1956–1960, in France from 1960–1962, in South Korea from 1962–1965, in Argentina from 1965–1969, in the Netherlands from 1969–1972, and in Iran from 1972–1974. While stationed in Vietnam, his deputy was William Colby, the future Director of Central Intelligence. His name was included in the 1996 membership directory of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, which Cryptome helped to publish. Cryptome acknowledged its link to Nicholas Natsios in 2000.

==Policies==

Young has said of Cryptome, &quot;We do expect to get false documents but it&#x27;s not our job to sort that out.&quot; In another interview, Young promoted skepticism about all sources of information, saying: &quot;Facts are not a trustworthy source of knowledge. Cryptome is not an authoritative source.&quot; When asked about providing context for material, Young said, &quot;We do not believe in &#x27;context.&#x27; That is authoritarian nonsense. For the same reason, we do not believe in verification, authentication, background.&quot;

The front page of the Cryptome website states that &quot;documents are removed from this site only by order served directly by a US court having jurisdiction. No court order has ever been served; any order served will be published here – or elsewhere if gagged by order.&quot; However, documents have been removed at the request of both law enforcement as well as individuals.

Cryptome has warned users that they do not have technical measures to protect the anonymity of their sources, saying &quot;don’t send us stuff and think that we’ll protect you.&quot;

==History==

* 1993: Young and Natsios get on the internet.
* 1994: What became Cryptome began with Young and Natsios&#x27;s participation in the Cypherpunks electronic mailing list and Urban Deadline. Natsios called this time &quot;seminal&quot; and &quot;transformative&quot; for the internet.
* 1996: Cryptome was officially created out of their architectural practice.
* 1999: In October journalist Declan McCullagh wrote about Young&#x27;s perusal of the site&#x27;s access logs.
* 2000: Cartome was founded. In July, two FBI agents spoke with Cryptome on the phone after Cryptome published a Public Security Intelligence Agency personnel file. The file listed 400 names, birthdates, and titles, notably included Director General Hidenao Toyoshima. The FBI expressed concerns over the file, but admitted it was legal to publish in the United States but not Japan. After speculation that the documents may have come from someone called &quot;Shigeo Kifuji&quot;, Cryptome identified the source as Hironari Noda.
* 2003: In January 2003, Cryptome received a grand jury subpoena for site access logs from Massachusetts. Cryptome responded by saying that there were no logs. Later that year, the FBI visited Cryptome to discuss recent postings &quot;intended to expose national security gaps.&quot;
* 2004: New York City removed warning signs around gas mains after Cryptome posts pictures of them, citing security concerns.
* 2006: Cryptome became one of the early organizers of WikiLeaks.
* 2007: In the early part of the year, Young and Natsios left Wikileaks. Cryptome published an archive of the secret, internal electronic mailing list of the Wikileaks organizers, from its inception through Young&#x27;s departure from the group. On April 20 the website received notice from its hosting company, Verio, that it would be evicted on May 4 for unspecified breaches of their acceptable use policy. Cryptome alleged that the shutdown is a censorship attempt in response to posts about the Coast Guard&#x27;s Deepwater program.
* 2010: Cryptome&#x27;s Earthlink account was compromised, leading to its website being hacked and Cryptome&#x27;s data copied. In February, Cryptome is briefly shut down by Network Solutions for alleged DMCA violations after it posted a &quot;Microsoft legal spy manual&quot;. Microsoft withdraws the complaint 3 days later and the website is restored. In March, PayPal stopped processing donations to Cryptome and froze the account due to &quot;suspicious activities&quot;. The account was restored after an &quot;investigation&quot; by PayPal.

* 2011: In July, Cryptome named the alleged CIA analyst who found Osama bin Laden. On August 31, Cryptome downloaded and decrypted the Cablegate files. On September 1 Cryptome published the unredacted United States diplomatic cables leak a day before Wikileaks. In September, Cryptome published a list of Intelligence and National Security Alliance members, alleging that they were spies.
* 2012: In February, the Cryptome website was hacked to infect visitors with malware.
* 2013: In February, Cryptome&#x27;s website, email and Twitter account were compromised, exposing whistleblowers and sources that had corresponded with Cryptome via email. Cryptome blamed hackers Ruxpin and Sabu, who was an FBI informant at the time. In June two US Secret Service agents visited Cryptome to request removal of a former presidential Bush family email allegedly hacked by Guccifer. In August, a complaint about Cryptome&#x27;s identification of alleged Japanese terrorists led Network Solutions to briefly shut down the site. In October Cryptome informed its users that Network Solutions had generated logs of site&#x27;s visitors, and that requests to delete the logs were not being honored. (According to Network Solutions&#x27;s website, logs are deleted after thirty days and Cryptome could choose to prevent the logging.)
* 2014: Cryptome attempted to raise $100,000 to fund the website and its other disclosure initiatives. In June, Cryptome was pulled offline again when malware was found infecting visitors to the site. In July, Cryptome said it would publish the remaining NSA documents taken by Edward Snowden in the &quot;coming weeks&quot;.
* 2015: In September, Cryptome announced that their encryption keys are compromised. A few days later, Cryptome filed for incorporation in New York. Later that month, a GCHQ document leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that the agency is monitoring visits to Cryptome. In October, a sold edition (USB stick) of the Cryptome archive was observed to contain web server logs, containing clues to the identities of Cryptome visitors. The logs had been mailed out to users who ordered the site&#x27;s archive at least since 2007. Cryptome posted pictures of logs dating back to the site&#x27;s creation, claiming that Cryptome is for sale. Cryptome later claimed that the sale is a parody and that &quot;Cryptome has no logs, never has&quot;, noting that their &quot;various ISPs have copious logs of many kinds&quot; along with metadata and that Cryptome tracks these &quot;to see what happens to our files&quot;.
* 2016: In April, Cryptome published thousands of credit-card numbers, passwords and personal information allegedly belonging to Qatar National Bank&#x27;s clients. In July, Cryptome alleged LinkNYC was &quot;tracking Cryptome&#x27;s movements through the city&quot; after the company responded to Cryptome&#x27;s social media posts by attempting to prevent them from photographing the company&#x27;s installations.
* 2020: In September, Cryptome testified that they published the unredacted cables before WikiLeaks, and were never contacted by law enforcement or instructed to remove them.
* 2022 In December, John Young wrote to the U.S. Justice Department saying that because he published the same leaked government documents at the centre of the U.S. case against Julian Assange, he should be indicted for violating the Espionage Act and a co-defendant at Assange&#x27;s trial.
* 2023 In January, Cryptome said that Twitter, Inc. suspended permanently the @Cryptome_org Twitter account, citing no reason. In August, Crytome announced that the site would be closed until Julian Assange is freed.

=== Relationship to WikiLeaks ===
In the 1990s, John Young and Julian Assange were in regular contact on the Cypherpunks mailing list. In late 2006, John Young joined WikiLeaks&#x27; advisory board before its public launch. Young also acted as its public face by first registering the WikiLeaks domain. Young revealed that he was approached by Julian Assange and asked to be the public face of Wikileaks; Young agreed and his name was listed on the website&#x27;s original domain registration form. 

In early 2007, Young and Natsios left Wikileaks due to concerns about the organizations&#x27; finances and fundraising, accusing it of being a &quot;money-making operation&quot; and &quot;business intelligence&quot; scheme, and expressing concern that the amount of money they sought &quot;could not be needed so soon except for suspect purposes.&quot; On January 7 2007, he emailed the internal mailing list accusing WikiLeaks of &quot;disinformation campaign against legitimate dissent&quot; and &quot;working for the enemy.&quot; 150 pages of emails were published on Cryptome, and Young publicly criticized the group for their lack of security, their showmanship, and their &quot;dramatic, rigged, press shindigs.&quot; In 2008, Young changed his opinion of WikiLeaks and became supportive of them again, but still had reservations about their &quot;self-promotional aspect, and its secrecy, its love of authoritativeness.&quot; 

In a 2010 interview with CNET.com John Young accused the organisation of a lack of transparency regarding its fundraising and financial management. He stated his belief that WikiLeaks could not guarantee whistleblowers the anonymity or confidentiality they claimed and that he &quot;would not trust them with information if it had any value, or if it put me at risk or anyone that I cared about at risk.&quot; Cryptome ended on bad terms with Wikileaks, with Young directly accusing them of selling classified material and calling them &quot;a criminal organization&quot;. In a separate interview, he called Assange a narcissist and compared him to Henry Kissinger. Young also accused George Soros and the Koch brothers of &quot;backing Wikileaks generously&quot;.

In October 2015, WikiLeaks made a searchable archive of Cryptome.

In September 2020, Cryptome testified that they published the unredacted diplomatic cables before WikiLeaks, and were never contacted by law enforcement or instructed to remove them. In December 2022, John Young wrote to the U.S. Justice Department saying that, because he published the same leaked government documents at the centre of the U.S. case against Julian Assange, he should be indicted for violating the Espionage Act and a co-defendant at Assange&#x27;s trial. In August 2023, Crytome announced that the site would be closed until Julian Assange is freed.

==Reception==
A 2004 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article assessed Cryptome with the headline, &quot;Advise the Public, Tip Off the Terrorists&quot; in its coverage of the site&#x27;s gas pipeline maps. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; made an even more alarming assessment of the site in 2005, calling it an &quot;invitation to terrorists&quot; and alleging that Young &quot;may well have put lives at risk&quot;.

A 2007 Wired article criticized Cryptome for going &quot;overboard&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; featured Cryptome in its 2008 &quot;Best of NYC&quot; feature, citing its hosting of &quot;photos, facts, and figures&quot; of the Iraq War.

WikiLeaks accused Cryptome of executing a &quot;smear campaign&quot; in 2010 after Cryptome posted what it said were email exchanges with WikiLeaks insiders, which WikiLeaks disputed.

Cryptome was awarded the &quot;Defensor Libertatis&quot; (defender of liberty) award at the 2010 Big Brother Awards, for a &quot;life in the fight against surveillance and censorship&quot; and for providing &quot;suppressed or otherwise censored documents to the global public&quot;. The awards committee noted that Cryptome had engaged with &quot;every protagonist of the military-electronic monitoring complex&quot;.

In 2012, Steven Aftergood, the director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, described Young and Cryptome as &quot;fearless and contemptuous of any pretensions to authority&quot; and &quot;oblivious to the security concerns that are the preconditions of a working democracy. And he seems indifferent to the human costs of involuntary disclosure of personal information.&quot; Aftergood specifically criticized Cryptome&#x27;s handling of the McGurk emails, saying &quot;it&#x27;s fine to oppose McGurk or anyone else. It wasn&#x27;t necessary to humiliate them&quot;.

In 2013, Cindy Cohn, then the legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, praised Cryptome as &quot;a really important safety valve for the rest of us, as to what our government is up to.&quot;

In 2014, Glenn Greenwald praised and criticized Cryptome, saying &quot;There is an obvious irony to complaining that we&#x27;re profiting from our work while [Cryptome] tries to raise $100,000 by featuring our work. Even though [Cryptome] occasionally does some repellent and demented things—such as posting the home addresses of Laura Poitras, Bart Gellman, and myself along with maps pointing to our homes—[they also do] things that are quite productive and valuable. On the whole, I&#x27;m glad there is a Cryptome and hope they succeed in raising the money they want.&quot;

Giganews criticized Cryptome for posting unverified allegations which Giganews described as completely false and without evidence. Giganews went on to question Cryptome&#x27;s credibility and motives, saying &quot;Cryptome&#x27;s failure to contact us to validate the allegations or respond to our concerns has lessened their credibility. It does not seem that Cryptome is in search for the truth, which leaves us to question what are their true motives.&quot;

Peter Earnest, a 36-year veteran of the CIA turned executive director of the International Spy Museum and chairman of the board of directors of the Association for Intelligence Officers criticized Cryptome for publishing the names of spies, saying it does considerable damage and aids people that would do them harm.

<doc id="217043" wikidata="Q947086" url="?curid=217043" title="Green Bay (Lake Michigan)">
<text>Green Bay is an arm of Lake Michigan, located along the south coast of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula and the east coast of Wisconsin. It is separated from the rest of the lake by the Door Peninsula in Wisconsin, the Garden Peninsula in Michigan, and the chain of islands between them, all formed by the Niagara Escarpment. Green Bay is some long, with a width ranging from about ; it is in area.

At the southern end of the bay is the city of Green Bay, Wisconsin, where the Fox River enters the bay. The Leo Frigo Memorial Bridge (formerly known as the Tower Drive bridge) spans the point where the bay begins and the Fox River ends, as the river flows south to north into the bay. Around mid-bay are Sturgeon Bay and the Peshtigo River. The Sturgeon Bay serves the city named after the bay as a shortcut for large ships to use to bypass the Door Peninsula, while the Peshtigo River serves Peshtigo and Crivitz. Locally, the bay is called the Bay of Green Bay to distinguish it from the city.

The bay is located in parts of five counties in Wisconsin (Brown, Door, Kewaunee, Marinette, Oconto), and two in Michigan (Delta, Menominee).

==History==
Oconto is home to Copper Culture State Park, which has remains dated to around 5000-6000 BC. It is a burial ground of the Copper Culture Indians. This burial ground is considered to be the oldest cemetery in Wisconsin and one of the oldest in the nation. The Ho-Chunk believe that they were created on the shores of Green Bay at a place called Red Banks.

The French Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, and missionary, Father Claude-Jean Allouez said the first Mass in Oconto on December 3, 1669.

The bay was named &quot;la baie des Puants&quot; (literally, &quot;the bay of the Stinks&quot;) by the French explorer Jean Nicolet as shown on many French maps of the 17th and 18th centuries. According to George R. Stewart, the French received the name from their Indian guides, who called the Ho-Chunk living near Green Bay by a derogatory word meaning &quot;Stinkers&quot;, thus the bay was the &quot;Bay of the Stinkers&quot;. This name perplexed the French, and Jacques Marquette thought the name might relate to the smell of the swamps when he explored the area in May 1673. His fellow explorer Louis Joliet, with two canoes and five voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry (Métis) were on their way to find the Mississippi River. They travelled up the Fox River, nearly to its headwaters. The French also called the bay &quot;Baie Verte&quot;, and the English kept this name as Green Bay. The name of the bay in the Menominee language is &quot;Pūcīhkit&quot;, or &quot;bay that smells like something rotting&quot;.

In 1671 and 1673, Louis André and Jacques Marquette described fluctuations in the water level of the bay and discussed what they thought caused them.

==Geology and Ecology==
Ferromanganese nodules have been found in the bay. Todorokite occurs within the nodules.

There are numerous reefs of exposed bedrock in the Porte des Mortes passage and in the bay.

North of the peninsula, warm water from Green Bay flows into Lake Michigan on the surface, while at the same time, cold lakewater enters Green Bay deep underneath.

In a study looking at fish stomach contents, walleye were found to eat between 5-6% and lake whitefish and yellow perch over the course of a year. However, south of Chambers Island, walleye eat considerably more lake whitefish in May and June. Walleye were found to eat more yellow perch on an annual basis, but not more than 15% of their overall diet during any particular month.

Walleye and Lake whitefish in Green Bay for the most part do not compete for the same prey, especially south of Chambers Island. Lake whitefish and yellow perch in the bay compete strongly for the same prey south of Chambers Island, and compete moderately north of it.

== Environmental concerns ==

=== Areas of concern ===
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, &quot;Areas of Concern are designated by the International Joint Commission as geographic areas in the Great Lakes basin having severe environmental degradation. There are 43 Areas of Concern with 26 in the United States, 17 in Canada, and five shared by the two countries.&quot; 

=== Background===

Lower green Bay Area of Concern was designated in 1987 under the Great Lakes Water Quality agreement.

It was designated by these sources of pollution:

* Affected by runoff pollution from urban and rural areas, municipal and industrial wastewater discharges and degraded habitats.
* Industrialization was a major factor in this becoming contaminated
* High turbidity, sedimentation, fluctuating dissolved oxygen, frequent algal blooms, degraded fish/wildlife/plant populations and adverse toxicant impacts.
* This AOC is a shallow environment that has a rapid recycling system which also contributes to water quality issues

The seasonal dead zone in the lower part of the bay may have gotten longer from 2009 to 2015.

==== Beneficial Use Impairments ====
Beneficial Use Impairments (BUI) are a change in the chemical, physical or biological integrity of the Great Lakes system sufficient to cause significant environmental degradation. The International Joint Commission identified 14 BUIs listed below. All BUIs that have been designated for an AOC, must be removed for the AOC to be considered restored and begin the delisting process.

Green Bay BUI&#x27;s:

* Restrictions on fish and wildlife consumption
* Tainting of fish and wildlife flavor
* Degradation of fish and wildlife populations
* Fish tumors or other deformities
* Degradation of aesthetics
* Restriction on dredging activities
* Loss of fish and wildlife habitat
* Bird/animal deformities or reproductive problems
* Excess of nutrients from pollutants 
* Restrictions on drinking water consumption, or taste and odor
* Beach closings
* Degradation of microorganism populations

==== Timeline of restoration ====
Since 1988 over three quarters of the 120 remedial actions recommended by the lower green bay remedial action plan have been implemented or initiated.

Industrialization was a major factor regarding the Lower Green Bay becoming contaminated; significant contributors were land water use (agriculture, logging, industry), high turbidity, sedimentation, frequent algal blooms, degraded fish/wildlife/plant populations and adverse toxicant impacts.

* 1988: First stage of action plan is released
* 1993: Update to action plan, current progress is released and future goals are identified
* 2003: USFWS releases an environmental assessment and restoration plan for the AOC
* 2003-2008: E.Coli measured consistently on beaches, shows overall health is good, but more projects needed to delist 
* 2009: Wisconsin DNR identifies delisting targets for each of the BUI&#x27;s 
* 2010-2011: Laws passed to reduce/ban phosphorus in household materials, reduce phosphorus runoff from farms, and set new water quality standards. 
* 2011: Stage 2 action plan update is released, describing key actions taken since 199, and identified future projects associated with the different BUI&#x27;s 
* 2012: Update action plan, US army Corps of Engineers begins Cat Island restoration project, and 360,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediments are dredged 
* 2013: UofW extension released fact sheet of BUIs status in the AOC, judge rules that all companies EPA considers responsible for PCB contamination must complete the required cleanup work

==== Cleanup ====
Past Emergency Clean Up: In 1999 and 2000, EPA oversaw a dredging project done by some of the paper companies about 3 miles upstream from the mouth of the Lower Fox River.  It removed 80,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment, containing 3,400 pounds of PCBs.

2019 marks the 16th year of clean up of the lower Green Bay. River clean up is scheduled for late March depending on ice conditions. Monitoring will continue to study fish, water, and PCB concentrations. Once the lower Green Bay clean up is complete long term monitoring will still be done on the entirety of the river.

<doc id="217045" wikidata="Q2513655" url="?curid=217045" title="Sama (Sufism)">
<text>Sama (; ) is a Sufi ceremony performed as part of the meditation and prayer practice dhikr. Sama means &quot;listening&quot;, while dhikr means &quot;remembrance&quot;. These performances often include singing, playing instruments, dancing, recitation of poetry and prayers, wearing symbolic attire, and other rituals. Sama is a particularly popular form of worship in Sufism.

In 2005, UNESCO confirmed the &quot;Mevlevi Sama Ceremony&quot; of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

==Etymology==

The term sama stems from the root-verb meaning &quot;acceptance by tradition&quot;, from which are derived the words سَمْع (&quot;sam‘un&quot;) and اِسْتِمَاع (&quot;’istimā‘un&quot;, listening), often paired with نَقْل (&quot;naqlun&quot;) and تَقْلِيد (&quot;taqlīdun&quot;, tradition). It may have been in use since the tenth century to refer to a type of dhikr (remembrance of God), a ceremony used by various Sufi orders, particularly the Chishti order of the sub-continent. It often involves prayer, song and dance. An alternative etymology for Sema may be the Greek σῆμα - sêma, which means tomb, significant or signal (e.g., semantics, polysemy).

==Origin==

The origination of Sama in the Mevlevi Order of Sufis is credited to Rumi, Sufi master and creator of the Mevlevis. The story of the creation of this unique form of dhikr is that Rumi was walking through the town marketplace one day when he heard the rhythmic hammering of the goldbeaters. It is believed that Rumi heard the dhikr, &quot;la ilaha ilallah&quot; or in English, &quot;There is no god but Allah&quot; in the apprentices beating of the gold and was so entranced in happiness he stretched out both of his arms and started spinning in a circle (sufi whirling). With that the practice of Sama and the dervishes of the Mevlevi order were born.

Similarly, Abu Sa`id, (357 A.H.) (967 C.E.) was born in Mayhana, a town near Sarakhs, in Iran, bordering Turkmenistan. He is noted for establishing a rule for conduct in the khanaqah and also for the introduction of music (sama&#x27;), poetry and dance, as part of the Sufi collective devotional ritual of dhikr.

==Current practice==
===Mevlevi===
The Whirling Dervishes of the Mevlevi order are probably the best-known practitioners of Sama. Mevlevi practitioners of sema are adult initiates into the order, which historically only meant men. Participants move as a group in a circle while also turning each individually.

Art is &quot;self expression&quot; and Sama is &quot;selfless expression&quot;-an experience of &quot;fanaa&quot;. Fanaa (Arabic: فناء‎ fanāʾ ) in Sufism is the &quot;passing away&quot; or &quot;annihilation&quot; of the self.

===Alevi/Bektashi===
Sema is prominent in the ceremonies of the Alevi community of Turkey and the closely related Bektashi Order.

The most common forms of Alevi sema include kirklar semahı (sema of the forty) and turnalar semahı (crane sema). They are performed by both male and female teenagers, often in mixed groups, and participants turn facing each other in pairs or small groups and do not necessarily whirl as individuals. Many cemevleri (Alevi meetinghouses) have organized sema groups that perform at events such as the annual Hacı Bektaş Veli Festival.

===Tannoura===
In Egypt, the Mevlevi form of Sama is known as tannoura and has been adopted (with some modifications) by other Sufi orders as well. It is also performed as a folk and concert dance.

==Symbolism==
The Sama represents a mystical journey of man&#x27;s spiritual ascent through mind and love to perfection. Turning towards the truth, the follower grows through love, deserts his ego, finds the truth and arrives at perfection. He then returns from this spiritual journey as a man who has reached maturity and a greater perfection, so as to love and to be of service to the whole of creation.
Rumi has said in reference to Sama&#x27;, &quot;For them it is the Sama&#x27; of this world and the other. Even more for the circle of dancers within the Sama&#x27; who turn and have in their midst, their own Ka&#x27;aba.&quot; This relates Sama&#x27; to the pilgrimage to Mecca, in that both are intended to bring all who are involved closer to God.
==Components==
Sama emphasizes singing, but also includes the playing of instruments, particularly for introductions and accompaniments. However, only instruments which are symbolic and not considered profane are used. The most common of these are the tambourine, bells, and flute. It often includes the singing of hymns, called &quot;qawl&quot; and &quot;bayt&quot;. Poetry is often included in the ceremony as well, because while it is inadequate by itself, it works together with aid in spiritual contemplation. Any poetry, even the erotic, can be applied to God, and thus used for this ceremony. However, the listener&#x27;s heart must first be pure, or the dancing components of sama&#x27; will make these people full of lust instead of love for God. Additionally, being in love with a person rather than with God clouds a person&#x27;s mind when they are listening to erotic poetry. Verses from the Qur&#x27;an are never used for this purpose, and not only because their meanings are said to be somewhat dulled through repetition. Qur&#x27;anic verses are never to be set to meditation, nor ornamented or improvised in any way, so that they remain sacred texts.

==Purpose==
Sama is a means of meditating on God through focusing on melodies and dancing. It brings out a person&#x27;s love of God, purifies the soul, and is a way of finding God. This practice is said to reveal what is already in one&#x27;s heart, rather than creating emotions. All of a person&#x27;s doubt disappears, and the heart and soul can communicate directly with God. The immediate goal of sama&#x27; is to reach &quot;wajd&quot;, which is a trance-like state of ecstasy. Physically, this state may include various and unexpected movements, agitation, and all types of dancing.
Another state that people hope to reach through sama&#x27; is &quot;khamra&quot;, which means &quot;spiritual drunkenness&quot;.
Ultimately, people hope to achieve the unveiling of mysteries and gain spiritual knowledge through &quot;wajd&quot;.
Sometimes, the experience of &quot;wajd&quot; becomes so strong that fainting or even, in extreme circumstances, death, occurs.

==Etiquette==
Participants in sama are expected to remain silent and still, and controlled throughout the ceremony, unless wajd occurs. This way, a higher degree of spiritual contemplation can be reached. Participants must restrain themselves from movement and crying until they reach a point in which they can no longer hold back. At this point, wajd can be reached. It is essential that the trance-like experience of wajd be genuine and not faked for any reason. Also, people must maintain proper intent and actions must be present throughout the sama&#x27;; otherwise, they cannot experience the ceremony&#x27;s intended positive effects.

==Controversy==
Muslims hold divergent views on the issue of sama and the use of music in general. Opponents, particularly within the Salafi/Wahhabi sect, are critical, while advocates, mainly among the majority Shias, support its use.

Advocates view chants as a required practice for spiritual growth. Al-Ghazzali wrote a chapter entitled &quot;Concerning Music and Dancing as Aids to the Religious Life&quot;, where he emphasized how the practices of music and dance are beneficial to Muslims, as long as their hearts are pure before engaging in these practices.

Opponents find music a heretical innovation or bidah and associate it with infidelity. They compare the physical sensations experienced by a person in the state of wajd to a state of physical drunkenness, and therefore do not condone it.

<doc id="217046" wikidata="Q140527" url="?curid=217046" title="The Three Musketeers">
<text>The Three Musketeers () is a French historical adventure novel written in 1844 by French author Alexandre Dumas. It is the first of the author&#x27;s three d&#x27;Artagnan Romances. As with some of his other works, he wrote it in collaboration with ghostwriter Auguste Maquet. It is in the swashbuckler genre, which has heroic, chivalrous swordsmen who fight for justice.

Set between 1625 and 1628, it recounts the adventures of a young man named d&#x27;Artagnan (a character based on Charles de Batz-Castelmore d&#x27;Artagnan) after he leaves home to travel to Paris, hoping to join the Musketeers of the Guard. Although d&#x27;Artagnan is not able to join this elite corps immediately, he is befriended by three of the most formidable musketeers of the age – Athos, Porthos and Aramis, &quot;the three musketeers&quot; or &quot;the three inseparables&quot; – and becomes involved in affairs of state and at court.

&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; is primarily a historical and adventure novel. However, Dumas frequently portrays various injustices, abuses and absurdities of the Ancien Régime, giving the novel an additional political significance at the time of its publication, a time when the debate in France between republicans and monarchists was still fierce. The story was first serialised from March to July 1844, during the July Monarchy, four years before the French Revolution of 1848 established the Second Republic.

The story of d&#x27;Artagnan is continued in &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; and &quot;The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later&quot;.

==Origin==

Dumas presents his novel as one of a series of recovered manuscripts, turning the origins of his romance into a little drama of its own. In the preface, he tells of being inspired by a scene in &quot;Mémoires de Monsieur d&#x27;Artagnan&quot; (1700), a historical novel by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras, printed by Pierre Rouge in Amsterdam, which Dumas discovered during his research for his history of Louis XIV. According to Dumas, the incident where d&#x27;Artagnan tells of his first visit to M. de Tréville, captain of the Musketeers, and how, in the antechamber, he encountered three young Béarnese with the names Athos, Porthos and Aramis, made such an impression on him that he continued to investigate. That much is true – the rest is fiction: He finally found the names of the three musketeers in a manuscript titled &quot;Mémoire de M. le comte de la Fère, etc.&quot; Dumas &quot;requested permission&quot; to reprint the manuscript; permission was granted:
Now, this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and entering into an engagement that if (of which we have no doubt) this first part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the second immediately.

In the meanwhile, since godfathers are second fathers, as it were, we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the Comte de la Fère, the pleasure or the ennui he may experience.

This being understood, let us proceed with our story.
&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; was written in collaboration with Auguste Maquet, who also worked with Dumas on its sequels (&quot;Twenty Years After&quot; and &quot;The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later&quot;), as well as &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. Maquet would suggest plot outlines after doing historical research; Dumas then expanded the plot, removing some characters, including new ones and imbuing the story with his unmistakable style.

&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; was first published in serial form in the newspaper &quot;Le Siècle&quot; between March and July 1844.

==Plot==
In 1625 France, D&#x27;Artagnan leaves his family in Gascony and travels to Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard. At a house in Meung-sur-Loire, an older man derides D&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s horse. Insulted, D&#x27;Artagnan demands a duel. The older man&#x27;s companions instead beat D&#x27;Artagnan unconscious with a cooking pot and a tong that breaks his sword. His letter of introduction to Monsieur de Tréville, the commander of the Musketeers, a King&#x27;s elite regiment, is stolen. D&#x27;Artagnan resolves to avenge himself upon the older man, who is actually the Comte de Rochefort, an agent of Cardinal Richelieu, who is passing the latter&#x27;s orders to his spy, Milady de Winter. 

In Paris, D&#x27;Artagnan visits Tréville at the Musketeers&#x27; headquarters. Without the letter, he faces a lukewarm reception from Tréville. Before their conversation concludes, D&#x27;Artagnan sees Rochefort passing in the street through Tréville&#x27;s window and rushes out of the building to confront him. Pursuing Rochefort, he separately offends three musketeers, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, who each demand satisfaction; D&#x27;Artagnan must fight a duel with each of them that afternoon.

As D&#x27;Artagnan prepares himself for the first duel, he realizes that Athos&#x27;s seconds are Porthos and Aramis, who are astonished that the Gascon intends to duel them all. As D&#x27;Artagnan and Athos begin, Richelieu&#x27;s guards appear and attempt to arrest the musketeers for illegal dueling. Offered to leave by the Cardinal&#x27;s guards, D&#x27;Artagnan decides to help the musketeers. Despite being outnumbered four to five, the four men win the battle. D&#x27;Artagnan seriously wounds Jussac, one of Richelieu&#x27;s officers and a renowned fighter. King Louis XIII appoints D&#x27;Artagnan to Des Essart&#x27;s company of the King&#x27;s Guards, a less prestigious regiment, and gives him forty pistoles. 

D&#x27;Artagnan hires a servant named Planchet and finds lodgings with Bonacieux, a merchant. His landlord later mentions the kidnapping of his wife, Constance Bonacieux, who works for Queen Anne of France. When she is released, D&#x27;Artagnan falls in love at first sight with her. Queen Anne secretly meets the Duke of Buckingham, England&#x27;s first minister. At the meeting, she gives him a diamond necklace, the King&#x27;s gift to her, as a keepsake.

Richelieu, who wants to diminish the influence of Queen Anne and her Spanish entourage on French internal affairs, plots to persuade the King that his wife is having an affair with Buckingham. On his advice, the King demands that the Queen wears the diamonds to an upcoming soirée. Constance tries to send her husband to London to fetch the diamonds, but he is instead manipulated by Richelieu and thus does not go, so D&#x27;Artagnan and his friends intercede. En route to England, Richelieu&#x27;s henchmen attack them and only D&#x27;Artagnan and Planchet reach London. Before arriving, D&#x27;Artagnan is compelled to assault and nearly to kill Comte de Wardes, a friend of Richelieu, cousin of Rochefort and Milady&#x27;s love interest. Although Milady stole two of the diamond studs, Buckingham provides replacements while delaying the thief&#x27;s return to Paris. D&#x27;Artagnan thus returns a complete set of jewels to Queen Anne in time to save her honor. 

D&#x27;Artagnan hopes to begin an affair with the grateful Constance. Invited to a date, he sees signs of a struggle and discovers that Rochefort and Bonacieux, acting under the orders of Richelieu, have kidnapped Constance. D&#x27;Artagnan traces his steps back to find his friends whom he abandoned wounded on his way to London. At their meeting, Athos, drunk, tells D&#x27;Artagnan a story about a count who fell in love with and married a young woman. Months later, the count discovered that his wife was branded with a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; on her shoulder, a punishment for felony. The count left her to die in a forest with her hands tied, abandoned his family castle and joined the King&#x27;s guard under another name. D&#x27;Artagnan understands that Athos is telling his own story.

In Paris, D&#x27;Artagnan meets Milady and recognizes her as one of Richelieu&#x27;s agents. He becomes infatuated with her, though her maid reveals that Milady is indifferent towards him. Entering her quarters in the dark, he pretends to be Comte de Wardes, whom she invited in a letter that D&#x27;Artagnan intercepted and makes love to her. However, D&#x27;Artagnan is not content with Milady&#x27;s having sex with him thinking that he is de Wardes. He fakes a rude letter from de Wardes, offending Milady. She asks D&#x27;Artagnan to duel and kill the Comte. As a prepayment, he has sex with her again, without assuming a fake identity. In the heat of passion, D&#x27;Artagnan reveals that it is not the first time they are together. Milady is enraged and in the subsequent scuffle, D&#x27;Artagnan discovers a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; branded on her shoulder. Milady attempts to kill D&#x27;Artagnan, who eludes her. He later tells Athos that his former wife is alive.

Cardinal Richelieu offers D&#x27;Artagnan a career in his guards&#x27; ranks. Dreading the prospect of losing his friends, D&#x27;Artagnan refuses despite understanding that his career prospects diminish as a result. With their regiments, D&#x27;Artagnan and the three musketeers are ordered to the Siege of La Rochelle. There, the four friends survive two assassination attempts by Milady&#x27;s agents. The would-be assassins die in the process.

At an inn, Athos overhears Richelieu asking Milady to murder Buckingham, whose support is critical to the Protestant rebels at La Rochelle. Richelieu gives her his order absolving the bearer from any responsibility, but Athos takes the order from her. To get time to secretly consult with his friends, Athos bets that he, D&#x27;Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis will hold the recaptured St. Gervais bastion against the rebels for an hour next morning. They resist for an hour and a half before retreating, killing a dozen Rochelaise in the process, which adds to their legend. They warn the Queen and Lord de Winter about Milady&#x27;s plan to assassinate Buckingham. Milady is imprisoned on arrival in England, but seduces her guard, Felton, and persuades him to allow her to escape and to kill Buckingham himself. 

D&#x27;Artagnan is informed that the Queen has rescued Constance from prison. He gets a permission to take her from a convent where the Queen sent her to hide.

Upon her return to France, Milady hides, coincidentally, in the convent where Constance is hiding. The naïve Constance clings to Milady who pretends to be another victim of the Cardinal&#x27;s intrigues. Seeking revenge on D&#x27;Artagnan, Milady poisons Constance before he arrives to rescue her. The musketeers catch Milady before she reaches Richelieu. Summoning a local executioner, they put Milady on trial, sentence her to death, and have her executed. The executioner reveals that it was he who branded Milady as a felon years before after she, a young nun at the time, seduced and then abandoned his brother, a local priest. 

When the four friends return to the Siege of La Rochelle, Richelieu&#x27;s Guards arrest D’Artagnan. D&#x27;Artagnan gives the Cardinal the secret order absolving the bearer of any responsibility which Athos had taken from Milady. Impressed with D&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s candor and secretly glad to be rid of Milady, Richelieu destroys the order and writes a new one, giving the bearer a promotion to lieutenant in Tréville&#x27;s company, leaving the name blank. D&#x27;Artagnan offers the letter to his three friends in turn, but each refuses it; Athos because it is beneath him, Porthos because he is retiring to marry his wealthy mistress, and Aramis because he is joining the priesthood. D&#x27;Artagnan, though heartbroken and full of regrets, receives the promotion he had coveted.

==Characters==
;Musketeers
*Athos – Comte de la Fère: he has never recovered from his marriage to Milady and seeks solace in wine. Ten years older, he becomes a father figure to d&#x27;Artagnan.
*Porthos – Senior du Vallon: a dandy, fond of fashionable clothes and keen to make a fortune for himself. The least cerebral of the quartet, he compensates with his homeric strength of body and character. 
*Aramis – René d&#x27;Herblay, a handsome young man who wavers between his religious calling and his fondness for women and court intrigue. 
*D&#x27;Artagnan – Charles de Batz de Castelmore D&#x27;Artagnan: an impetuous, brave and clever young man seeking to become a musketeer in France.

;Musketeers&#x27; servants
*Planchet – a young man from Picardy, he is seen by Porthos on the Pont de la Tournelle spitting into the river below. Porthos takes this as a sign of good character and hires him on the spot to serve d&#x27;Artagnan. He turns out to be a brave, intelligent and loyal servant.
*Grimaud – a Breton, whom Athos, a strict master, only permits to speak in emergencies; he mostly communicates through sign language.
*Mousqueton – originally a Norman named Boniface; Porthos, however, changes his name to one that sounds better. He is a would-be dandy, just as vain as his master. In lieu of pay, he is clothed and lodged in a manner superior to that usual for servants, dressing grandly in his master&#x27;s renovated old clothing.
*Bazin – from the province of Berry, Bazin is a pious man who waits for the day his master (Aramis) will join the church, as he has always dreamed of serving a churchman.

;Others
*Anne de Breuil, Milady de Winter – a beautiful and evil spy of the Cardinal, she is also Athos&#x27;s ex-wife. She is a widow of Lord de Winter&#x27;s brother. (Unbeknownst to everyone, this marriage is illegal as Athos is alive.) D&#x27;Artagnan impersonates a rival to spend a night with her, attracting her deadly hatred when the deceit is revealed.
*Rochefort – a more conventional agent of the Cardinal. Following their meeting at Meung on the road to Paris, d&#x27;Artagnan swears to have his revenge. He misses several opportunities, but their paths finally cross again towards the end of the novel.
*Constance Bonacieux – the queen&#x27;s seamstress and confidante. After d&#x27;Artagnan rescues her from the Cardinal&#x27;s Guard, he immediately falls in love with her. She appreciates his protection, but the relationship is never consummated.
*Monsieur Bonacieux – Constance&#x27;s husband. He initially enlists d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s help to rescue his wife from the Cardinal&#x27;s Guards, but when he himself is arrested, Richelieu turns Monsieur Bonacieux against his wife, and he goes on to play a role in her abduction.
*Kitty – a servant of Milady de Winter. She dislikes her mistress and adores d&#x27;Artagnan.
*Lord de Winter – brother of Milady&#x27;s second husband who died of a mysterious disease (apparently poisoned by Milady). Acting on a warning from d&#x27;Artagnan, he imprisons Milady upon her arrival in England and plans to send her overseas in exile. Later, he takes part in Milady&#x27;s trial.

;Historical characters
*King Louis XIII of France – presented by Dumas as a fairly weak and self-indulgent monarch, often manipulated by his chief minister.
*Queen Anne of Austria – the queen of France, described as naive and disinterested in the affairs of state, neglected by her husband and persecuted by the Cardinal for the mix of political and personal reasons.
*Cardinal Richelieu – Armand Jean du Plessis, the king&#x27;s chief minister, focused on strengthening the monarchy and the French national state. At the same time, he resents the queen for rebuffing his advances. 
*M. de Tréville – captain of the Musketeers, courtier and a childhood friend of the King. Treville is a mentor, a confidant, and occasionally a protector to the three musketeers and d&#x27;Artagnan.
*George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham – a handsome and charismatic favorite of the King of England used to getting his way; he thinks nothing of starting a war between England and France for his personal convenience. His courtship of Anne of Austria places her in great peril.
*John Felton – a Puritan officer assigned by Lord de Winter to guard Milady and warned about her ways, he is nonetheless seduced by her in a matter of days and assassinates Buckingham at her request.

==Editions==
&quot;Les Trois Mousquetaires&quot; was translated into three English versions by 1846. One of these, by William Barrow (1817–1877), is still in print and fairly faithful to the original, available in the Oxford World&#x27;s Classics 1999 edition. To conform to 19th-century English standards, all of the explicit and many of the implicit references to sexuality were removed, adversely affecting the readability of several scenes, such as the scenes between d&#x27;Artagnan and Milady.

In 1960 Manfred E.Graham adapted the book for the Longman&#x27;s Simplified English Series.

There are 3 modern translations as well. One recent English translation is by Will Hobson in 2002.

Another is by Richard Pevear (2006), who, though applauding Barrow&#x27;s work, states that most of the modern translations available today are &quot;textbook examples of bad translation practices&quot; which &quot;give their readers an extremely distorted notion of Dumas&#x27; writing.&quot;

The most recent translation is by the American translator Lawrence Ellsworth (Lawrence Schick) published by Pegasus Books in February 2018 from the 1956 French edition.

Ellsworth decided to translate the full trilogy of The d&#x27;Artagnan Romances as well as the two novels of The Count of Moret for 21st century readers in nine volumes, making it the first complete translation in over a century and a half. Seven out of nine volumes have been published and the eighth volume is in progress in a serialized online publication.

Set 10 years after the original, it is loosely based on the novel &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;. A key difference between the two &quot;Dogtanian&quot; adaptions and Dumas&#x27; novel is that the character traits of Athos and Porthos were interchanged, making Athos the extrovert and Porthos the secretive noble of the group.

In 1989, Gakken produced a new anime adaptation called &quot;The Three Musketeers Anime&quot;, this time with human characters, which features several departures from the original.

In 2010, a co-operative game called &quot;Mousquetaires du Roy&quot; was released by Ystari and Rio Grande. The alternative spelling of &quot;Roy&quot; was taken from the old French and is rumoured to be preferred over the regular spelling because the publishers desire to have a letter &quot;Y&quot; in the name of the games they publish. Designed by François Combe and Gilles Lehmann for 1-5 players, the medium heavy game depicts the quest to retrieve the Queen&#x27;s diamonds, while at the same time fending off disasters back in Paris.

<text>Orsanmichele (; &quot;Kitchen Garden of St. Michael&quot;, from the Tuscan contraction of the Italian word &quot;orto&quot;) is a church in the Italian city of Florence. The building was constructed on the site of the kitchen garden of the monastery of San Michele which no longer exists.

Located on the Via Calzaiuoli in Florence, the church was originally built as a grain market in 1337 by Francesco Talenti, Neri di Fioravante, and Benci di Cione. Between 1380 and 1404, it was converted into a church used as the chapel of Florence&#x27;s powerful craft and trade guilds. On the ground floor of the square building the 13th-century arches that had originally been open, forming the loggia-style grain market, were walled up. The second floor was devoted to offices, while the third housed one of the city&#x27;s municipal grain storehouses, maintained to withstand famine or siege. 

As early as 1339 the main guilds had each been assigned a space between the arches to make a framed niche, with a statue of their patron saint in it. At this time, only the Arte de Lana (wool guild) seems to have done so; this figure was later replaced.

Towards the end of the 14th century, the guilds were again charged by the city to commission statues of their patron saints to embellish the facades of the church. The majority of the statues date from 1400 to 1428, with two of the earliest from that period later replaced, in the 16th century. The sculptures seen in the exterior niches today are copies, the originals having been removed to museums, mostly the one on the upper floor of the building (see below).

== Interior ==

Inside the church is Andrea Orcagna&#x27;s bejeweled Gothic Tabernacle (1355–59) encasing a repainting by Bernardo Daddi&#x27;s of an older icon of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;.

==Modern assessment==

Orsanmichele&#x27;s statuary is a relic of the fierce devotion and pride of Florentine trades, and a reminder that great art often arises out of a competitive climate. Each trade hoped to outdo the other in commissioning original, groundbreaking sculptures for public display on Florence&#x27;s most important street, and the artists hired and materials used (especially bronze) indicate the importance that was placed on this site.

Today, all of the original sculptures have been removed and replaced with modern duplicates to protect them from the elements and vandalism. The originals mainly reside in the museum of Orsanmichele, which occupies the upper floor of the church, and can be seen on every Monday, the only day when the museum is open. Two works by Donatello are in other Florentine museums: &quot;St. George&quot; and its niche are in the Bargello, and &quot;St. Louis of Toulouse&quot; is in the museum of the Basilica di Santa Croce.
== Exterior ==
The facades held 14 architecturally designed external niches, which were filled from 1399 to around 1430. The three richest guilds opted to make their figures in the far more costly bronze, which cost approximately ten times the amount of the stone figures.

<text>Finsbury Park () is an intermodal interchange station in North London for London Underground, National Rail and London Buses services. The station is the third busiest Underground station outside Zone 1, with over 33 million passengers using the station in 2019.

==Name and location==
The station is named after the nearby Finsbury Park, one of the oldest of London&#x27;s Victorian parks, opening in 1869.

The interchange consists of a National Rail station, a London Underground station and two bus stations, all interconnected. The main entrances are by the eastern bus station on Station Place. The National Rail ticket office here lies between one entrance marked by the Underground roundel symbol and the other which is marked by the National Rail symbol; the latter provides direct access to the main line platforms. A new, larger western entrance by Wells Terrace and Goodwin Place opened in December 2019, as part of the upgrade of the station. There is also a narrow side entrance to the south on the A503 Seven Sisters Road (open during peak times only. The complex is located in Travelcard Zone 2.

London Buses routes 4, 19, 29, 106, 153, 210, 236, 253, 254, 259, W3, W7, night routes N19, N29, N253, N279, serve the station.

==History==
Finsbury Park is on the route of the East Coast Main Line from King&#x27;s Cross to the north of England and Scotland. The southern section of this was built in stages during the 1840s and early 1850s by the Great Northern Railway (GNR). Tracks were first laid through Finsbury Park in 1850 to the GNR&#x27;s temporary terminus at Maiden Lane just north of the permanent terminus at King&#x27;s Cross (which opened in 1852). The first station at Finsbury Park opened on 1 July 1861 and was originally named &quot;Seven Sisters Road (Holloway)&quot;.

Soon after the first station opened, the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&amp;LR) began construction of a line from Finsbury Park to Edgware. The GNR took over the EH&amp;LR shortly before its opening on 22 August 1867. The station was given its current name &quot;Finsbury Park&quot; on 15 November 1869. The Edgware branch platforms were on each side of the main tracks. The southbound (&quot;up&quot;) track of the branch crossed over the main line by a bridge on its way into the station.

The Great Northern &amp; City Railway (GN&amp;CR) was an underground railway planned to provide a tunnel link between Finsbury Park and Moorgate in the City of London as an alternative London terminus for GNR trains. The tunnels were constructed with a large diameter to accommodate this service but a dispute between the two companies prevented the GN&amp;CR connecting its tunnels to the GNR platforms. The GN&amp;CR tunnels, instead, terminated beneath the main line station without a connection to the surface and the line operated as a shuttle between Finsbury Park and Moorgate. The line opened on 14 February 1904 and on 1 September 1913, it was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway.

The Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR) (now London Underground&#x27;s Piccadilly line) opened on 15 December 1906 by David Lloyd George, then President of the Board of Trade, between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith in west London. The tube railway originated as the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN&amp;SR) in 1899 and was initially supported by the GNR as a means of relieving congestion on its main line into King&#x27;s Cross by constructing a tube line under the GNR&#x27;s tracks from Alexandra Palace to King&#x27;s Cross and then to the Strand. The GN&amp;SR was taken over in 1901 by a consortium led by Charles Yerkes before any work had been carried out and the section north of Finsbury Park was cancelled. The GN&amp;SR was merged with the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway to form the GNP&amp;BR. It was constructed with the smaller-diameter tube tunnels common to other underground railways being constructed in London at that time. Its platforms were constructed by the GNR parallel with the GN&amp;CR&#x27;s platforms beneath the main line station.

=== Construction of Piccadilly line and Northern Heights plan ===
The transport interchange at Finsbury Park had long been recognised as a severe bottle-neck for passengers heading north from central London and calls had been regularly made to improve the situation by extending northwards one of the two underground lines serving the station. Until the mid-1920s this had been resisted by the GNR and its successor the LNER as a threat to its suburban passenger traffic, but mounting pressure finally forced the LNER to relinquish its veto and lift its objections to the Underground making an extension.

With financial support from the government, the Underground began construction of an extension of the Piccadilly line northwards to Cockfosters and the first section, to Arnos Grove, opened on 19 September 1932. The route was opened fully on 31 July 1933.
By 1935 the GNR had become part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). In 1935 London Underground announced its New Works Programme. This included plans to take over the steam-operated LNER branch lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace – collectively known as the &quot;Northern Heights&quot; lines. These routes were to be joined to the Northern City Line by the construction of new tracks from Drayton Park to the surface at Finsbury Park as had originally been intended by the GN&amp;CR. Trains would then have been able to run from any of the three LNER termini to Moorgate. The Northern City Line tunnels from Drayton Park to Finsbury Park would have been taken out of use. A separate connection between Archway Underground station (then named Highgate) and East Finchley station was also planned, including a new Underground station below the then-existing surface station at Highgate.

In early 1939 London Underground announced that the Drayton Park to Alexandra Palace route would begin operation in autumn 1940 and the branch was transferred to the control of the Northern line. The start of the Second World War caused the postponement and eventual cancellation of this and much of the other plans, leaving operations at Finsbury Park unchanged. The surface connection between Drayton Park and Finsbury Park was abandoned and the Northern City Line continued to run between Moorgate and Finsbury Park in tunnel. Traffic on the Highgate and Alexandra Palace branch diminished and it was closed to passengers in 1954 although it was retained for freight to Edgware and stock movements to Highgate Depot.

=== Construction of Victoria line ===
London Underground had for many years been planning a new route across central London to relieve pressure on the central sections of the Piccadilly and Northern lines. In the early 1960s the plans were consolidated into a single plan for the Victoria line. The route of the new line was designed to provide the maximum number of interchanges with other Underground and British Rail lines as possible, and Finsbury Park was an ideal candidate for this. The plan called for the reconfiguration of the four underground platforms used by the Northern City Line and the Piccadilly line. To allow the construction works necessary for the provision of cross-platform interchanges between the Piccadilly and the Victoria lines the Northern City service to Finsbury Park was ended on 3 October 1964. After this date trains from Moorgate ran only as far as Drayton Park.
The Northern City platforms became the southbound platforms for both the Piccadilly and Victoria lines which were connected to the previously dead-end tunnels to the north of the platforms. The old southbound Piccadilly line platform then became the Victoria line northbound platform, with the northbound Piccadilly line platform unchanged. New connecting tunnels were constructed. There are cross-over connections between each pair of northbound and southbound tunnels to enable stock transfers, given that the Victoria line is otherwise completely self-contained.

The first section of the Victoria line, including Finsbury Park, opened between Walthamstow Central and Highbury &amp; Islington on 1 September 1968. When the Victoria line was built in the 1960s, the walls in Finsbury Park station were decorated with mosaics of duelling pistols, which can still be seen. This was based on a mistaken identification of Finsbury Park with Finsbury Fields, which was used by Londoners since medieval times for archery and sports, and also associated with 18th-century duels and one of the first hot air balloon flights. Finsbury Fields was close to the present-day Finsbury Square, south. At the same time the long entrance subways and the Wells Terrace booking hall (at the bus station end) were rebuilt to a high standard.

=== Northern City Line modifications ===

London Underground continued to use the Edgware branch occasionally for stock movements between its depot at Highgate and Finsbury Park until September 1970. The tracks were removed in 1971 and the platforms at Finsbury Park which served this line were demolished; their location is now the pedestrian access to the eastern station entrance. The bridge over Stroud Green Road which carried the tracks was removed. The abutment walls remain.

In 1976, part of the abandoned Northern Heights plan was completed in reverse. The Northern City Line, which had originally run to the underground part of the station, was transferred from London Underground to British Rail. An unfinished surface connection between Drayton Park and Finsbury Park begun as part of the &quot;Northern Heights&quot; project was completed to make it possible to bring trains to the surface at Finsbury Park and run through trains from Moorgate on to the north. The service commenced operation on 8 November 1976.

=== Station upgrades ===
In the late 2010s, the station was upgraded and refurbished throughout, including the provision of step free access, ticket barriers and a new, larger western entrance to the bus station, Goodwin Street and Wells Terrace.

Step free access to both the Piccadilly and Victoria lines, as well as to platforms 1&amp;2 and 5&amp;6 of the National Rail station was completed in January 2019. The new western entrance was constructed in collaboration with Telford Homes, the developer of &quot;City North&quot; - a residential and commercial development adjacent to the station. This new, larger entrance opened in December 2019, replacing an older entrance constructed in the 1970s, which closed in July 2016 as part of the City North development works. A project to make the remaining platforms (3, 4, 7 &amp; 8) step-free began in July 2021 and was completed in April 2023.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 9 November 1959, a freight train ran away and collided with an empty coaching-stock train. The collision occurred on a bridge over a road, severely damaging the bridge.

On 8 May 1974, musician Graham Bond died after getting run over by a Piccadilly line train at the station.

On 17 December 1992, Jonathan Zito was stabbed to death in the station.

== National Rail services ==

===Existing services===
The above-ground National Rail station, which has a separate ticket office to the Underground station, is managed and served by Great Northern. Trains from Moorgate and King&#x27;s Cross form inner suburban services to Stevenage via Hertford North and Welwyn Garden City and outer suburban services start from Kings Cross towards Peterborough and Cambridge. Inner suburban service formerly did not serve the Moorgate branch at night and at weekends, being diverted to London Kings Cross instead. There are currently six platforms but only five tracks, as platforms 6 and 7 share a track (though platform 6 is no longer separately numbered or utilised). The platforms were renumbered on 19 May 2013 to prepare for two new up platforms, with all existing numbers increased by 2. Typically, platform 1 is used by southbound suburban services to Moorgate, platform 2 by southbound regional services to King&#x27;s Cross and southbound Thameslink services, platform 7 (and occasionally also platform 5) by northbound regional services from King&#x27;s Cross and northbound Thameslink Services, and platform 8 by northbound suburban services from Moorgate. 

===Thameslink services===

In 2018, as part of the Thameslink Programme, Finsbury Park was linked to the Thameslink network via a new tunnel which connects the Great Northern Route to the lines into . This has enabled through services to run from and Peterborough via Finsbury Park and to , Horsham and .

Currently, not all trains labelled on the train as &#x27;Thameslink&#x27; actually travel through the Thameslink core, as many serve King&#x27;s Cross instead. During the week, and on Saturdays, there are currently four trains an hour off peak in each direction through the core to/from Finsbury Park; two to/from Peterborough to Horsham and two to/from Brighton to Cambridge. There are also an extra two trains per hour from Welwyn Garden City to Sevenoaks at peak times during the week. On Sundays there is only one train per hour in each direction, to/from Brighton to Cambridge.

The introduction of Thameslink services at Finsbury Park was part of the Thameslink Programme, and in the connected &#x27;RailPlan 2020&#x27; consultation, it was stated that they also planned to start a two trains per hour service from Cambridge to Maidstone East via Finsbury Park from December 2019, however this service does not yet exist.

===New Platform 1===
In February 2008 Network Rail published its East Coast Main Line Route Utilisation Strategy (ECMLRUS). This recommended improvements to the tracks able to carry passenger trains between Alexandra Palace Station and Finsbury Park. In March 2009 Network Rail published its CP4 Delivery Plan 2009, which involved the bringing back into service of an abandoned southbound platform; this plan was confirmed in a June 2010 update to the plan. Regular use of this new platform, Platform 1, commenced at the December 2013 timetable change. and since that date regular use of platform 3 has ceased, with platforms 1 and 2 now used instead. Since the December 2015 timetable change, the Northern City line to Moorgate operates through until end of service during the week and at weekends, rather than diverting to Kings Cross at weekends.

===Other station facilities===

British Transport Police maintain a presence at Finsbury Park and have a police station at the Wells Terrace entrance.




==London Underground==
The station is served by the Piccadilly and Victoria lines. Although thought of as a &#x27;deep-level&#x27; tube station, Finsbury Park has no escalators as its lines are less than 6 m below street level.

Access to the Piccadilly and Victoria line platforms was previously by staircase only, reached via two narrow passages that prevented the installation of ticket barriers. As part of the upgrade of the station in the 2010s, ticket barriers were installed at both the eastern and western entrances to the station, as well as the provision of step free access throughout the station.

<doc id="217057" wikidata="Q15792" url="?curid=217057" title="Duccio">
<text>Duccio di Buoninsegna ( , ; – ), commonly known as just Duccio, was an Italian painter active in Siena, Tuscany, in the late 13th and early 14th century. He was hired throughout his life to complete many important works in government and religious buildings around Italy. Duccio is considered one of the greatest Italian painters of the Middle Ages, and is credited with creating the painting styles of Trecento and the Sienese school. He also contributed significantly to the Sienese Gothic style.

==Biography==
Although much is still unconfirmed about Duccio and his life, there is more documentation of him and his life than of other Italian painters of his time. It is known that he was born and died in the city of Siena, and was also mostly active in the surrounding region of Tuscany. Other details of his early life and family are as uncertain, as much else in his history.

One avenue to reconstructing Duccio&#x27;s biography are the traces of him in archives that list when he ran up debts or incurred fines. Some records say he was married with seven children. The relative abundance of archival mentions has led historians to believe that he had difficulties managing his life and his money. Due to his debts, Duccio&#x27;s family dissociated themselves from him after his death.

Another route to filling in Duccio&#x27;s biography is by analyzing the works that can be attributed to him with certainty. Information can be obtained by analyzing his style, the date and location of the works, and more. Due to gaps where Duccio&#x27;s name goes unmentioned in the Sienese records for years at a time, scholars speculate he may have traveled to Paris, Assisi and Rome.

Nevertheless, his artistic talents were enough to overshadow his lack of organization as a citizen, and he became famous in his own lifetime. In the 14th century Duccio became one of the most favored and radical painters in Siena.

==Artistic career==

Where Duccio studied, and with whom, is still a matter of great debate, but by analyzing his style and technique art historians have been able to limit the field. Many believe that he studied under Cimabue, while others think that maybe he had actually traveled to Constantinople himself and learned directly from a Byzantine master.

Little is known of his painting career prior to 1278, when at the age of 23 he is recorded as having painted twelve account book cases. Although Duccio was active from 1268 to about 1311 only approximately 13 of his works survive today.

Of Duccio&#x27;s surviving works, only two can be definitively dated. Both were major public commissions: the &quot;Rucellai Madonna&quot; (Galleria degli Uffizi), commissioned in April 1285 by the Compagnia del Laudesi di Maria Vergine for a chapel in Santa Maria Novella in Florence; and the Maestà commissioned for the high altar of Siena Cathedral in 1308, which Duccio completed by June 1311.

==Style==

Duccio&#x27;s known works are on wood panel, painted in egg tempera and embellished with gold leaf. Differently from his contemporaries and artists before him, Duccio was a master of tempera and managed to conquer the medium with delicacy and precision. There is no clear evidence that Duccio painted frescoes.

Duccio&#x27;s style was similar to Byzantine art in some ways, with its gold backgrounds and familiar religious scenes; however, it was also different and more experimental. Duccio began to break down the sharp lines of Byzantine art, and soften the figures. He used modeling (playing with light and dark colors) to reveal the figures underneath the heavy drapery; hands, faces, and feet became more rounded and three-dimensional. Duccio&#x27;s paintings are inviting and warm with color. His pieces consisted of many delicate details and were sometimes inlaid with jewels or ornamental fabrics. Duccio was also noted for his complex organization of space. He organized his characters specifically and purposefully. In his &quot;Rucellai Madonna&quot; () the viewer can see all of these qualities at play.

Duccio was also one of the first painters to put figures in architectural settings, as he began to explore and investigate depth and space. He also had a refined attention to emotion not seen in other painters at this time. The characters interact tenderly with each other; it is no longer Christ and the Virgin, it is mother and child. He flirts with naturalism, but his paintings are still awe inspiring. Duccio&#x27;s figures seem to be otherworldly or heavenly, consisting of beautiful colors, soft hair, gracefulness and fabrics not available to mere humans.

He influenced many other painters, most notably Simone Martini, and the brothers Ambrogio and Pietro Lorenzetti.

==Followers==
In the course of his life, Duccio had many pupils even if it is not known if they were true pupils who were formed and matured artistically within his workshop, or they were simply painters who imitated his style. Many of the artists are anonymous, and their connection to Duccio has emerged only from analysis of a body of work with common stylistic traits. The first pupils, who can be referred to as a group as first-generation followers, were active between about 1290 and 1320 and include the Master of Badia a Isola, the Master of Città di Castello, the Aringhieri Master, the Master of the &quot;Collazioni dei Santi Padri&quot; and the Master of San Polo in Rosso.

Another group of followers, who could be termed followers of the second generation, were active between about 1300 and 1335 and include Segna di Bonaventura, Ugolino di Nerio, the Master of the Gondi Maestà, the Master of Monte Oliveto and the Master of Monterotondo. It should, however, be said that Segna di Bonaventura was already active prior to 1300 and so he overlaps as to period both the first and second generation of followers.

A third group followed Duccio only several years after his death, which shows the impact his painting had on Siena and on Tuscany as a whole. The artists of this third group, active between about 1330 and 1350, include Segna di Bonaventura&#x27;s sons, that is, Niccolò di Segna and Francesco di Segna, and a pupil of Ugolino di Nerio: the Master of Chianciano.

Some of the artists were influenced by Duccio alone to the point of creating a decided affinity or kinship between their works and his. Among them was the Master of Badia a Isola, and Ugolino di Nerio, along with Segna di Bonaventura and their sons. Other artists were influenced also by other schools, and these include the Aringhieri Master (think of the massive volumes of Giotto), and the Master of the Gondi Maestà (who shows the influence also of Simone Martini).

The case of Simone Martini and Pietro Lorenzetti is somewhat different. Both artists painted works that have affinities with Duccio: for Simone from about 1305, and Pietro from about 1310 onwards. However, from the outset their work showed distinctive individual features, as can be seen in Simone&#x27;s Madonna and Child no. 583 (1305–1310) and in Pietro&#x27;s &quot;Orsini Triptych&quot;, painted at Assisi (about 1310–1315). Later the two developed styles with completely independent characteristics such that they acquired an artistic standing that elevates them well beyond being labelled simply as followers of Duccio.

== Exhibitions ==
Many of Duccio’s surviving paintings were displayed in the 2024-25 exhibit &quot;&quot; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and National Gallery London, alongside those of brothers Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Simone Martini, and other Sienese masters of the era. The exhibit was judged “the must-see art show of the season.”

<text>Simone Martini ( – July 1344) was an Italian painter born in Siena.
He was a major figure in the development of early Italian painting and greatly influenced the development of the International Gothic style.

It is thought that Martini was a pupil of Duccio di Buoninsegna, the leading Sienese painter of his time. According to late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari, Simone was instead a pupil of Giotto di Bondone, with whom he went to Rome to paint at the Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Giotto also executing a mosaic there. Martini&#x27;s brother-in-law was the artist Lippo Memmi. Very little documentation of Simone&#x27;s life survives, and many attributions are debated by art historians. According to E. H. Gombrich, he was a friend of Petrarch and had painted a portrait of Laura.

==Biography==
Simone was doubtlessly apprenticed from an early age, as would have been the normal practice. Among his first documented works is the &quot;Maestà&quot; of 1315 in the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena. Lippo Memmi painted a similar &quot;Maestà&quot; for the Palazzo Comunale in San Gimignano shortly afterwards, an example of the enduring influence Simone&#x27;s prototypes would have on other artists throughout the 14th century. Perpetuating the Sienese tradition, Simone&#x27;s style contrasted with the sobriety and monumentality of Florentine art, and is noted for its soft, stylized, decorative features, sinuosity of line, and courtly elegance. Simone&#x27;s art owes much to French manuscript illumination and ivory carving: examples of such art were brought to Siena in the fourteenth century by means of the Via Francigena, a main pilgrimage and trade route from Northern Europe to Rome.

Simone&#x27;s other major works include the &quot;Saint Louis of Toulouse Crowning His Brother Robert of Anjou&quot; (1317, now Museo di Capodimonte, Naples); this work was painted during a stay in Naples at the request of the king. During this stay, putative pupils were his son Francesco, Gennaro di Cola, and Stefanone.

Simone also painted the Saint Catherine of Alexandria Polyptych in Pisa (1319) and the &quot;Annunciation with St. Margaret and St. Ansanus&quot; at the Uffizi in Florence (1333), as well as frescoes in the San Martino Chapel in the lower church of the Basilica of San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi. He was commissioned to paint a series of frescos for the porch of the Avignon Cathedral of which only the faint sinopia outlines remains. Francis Petrarch became a friend of Simone&#x27;s while in Avignon, and two of Petrarch&#x27;s sonnets (&quot;Canzoniere&quot; 96 and 130) make reference to a portrait of Laura de Noves that Simone supposedly painted for the poet (according to Vasari). A &quot;Christ Discovered in the Temple &quot;(1342) is in the collections of Liverpool&#x27;s Walker Art Gallery.

Simone Martini died while in the service of the Papal court at Avignon in 1344 having likely moved there in 1334 or 1335.

<doc id="217088" wikidata="Q2711496" url="?curid=217088" title="List of chorale harmonisations by Johann Sebastian Bach">
<text>Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s chorale harmonisations, alternatively named four-part chorales, are Lutheran hymn settings that characteristically conform to the following:
* four-part harmony
* SATB vocal forces
* pre-existing hymn tune allotted to the soprano part
* text treatment:
** homophonic
** no repetitions (i.e., each syllable of the hymn text is sung one time)

Around 400 of such chorale settings by Bach, mostly composed in the first four decades of the 18th century, are extant:
* Around half of that number are chorales which were transmitted in the context of larger vocal works such as cantatas, motets, Passions and oratorios. A large part of these chorales are extant as autographs by the composer, and for nearly all of them a colla parte instrumental and/or continuo accompaniment are known.
* All other four-part chorales exclusively survived in collections of short works, which include manuscripts and 18th-century prints. Apart from the &quot;Three Wedding Chorales&quot; collection (BWV 250–252), these are copies by other scribes and prints only published after the composer&#x27;s death, lacking context information, such as instrumental accompaniment, for the individual harmonisations.

Apart from homophonic choral settings, Bach&#x27;s Lutheran hymn harmonisations also appear as:
* sung chorale fantasias in some of Bach&#x27;s larger vocal works
* hymn melodies for which Bach composed or improved a thorough bass accompaniment, for instance as included in Georg Christian Schemelli&#x27;s &quot;Musicalisches Gesang-Buch&quot;
* harmonisations included in purely instrumental compositions, most typically organ compositions such as chorale preludes or chorale partitas.

== History ==
The compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach that had been printed during his lifetime were nearly exclusively instrumental works. Moreover, by the time Bach died in 1750 it was forgotten that a few of his vocal works (BWV 71, BWV 439–507...) had indeed been printed in the first half of the 18th century. In the period between the publication of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; in the early 1750s, and the publication of further works from 1800, only one group of Bach&#x27;s works was published: his four-part chorales.

The most complete 18th century publication of chorales by J. S. Bach is Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach&#x27;s edition in four volumes, published by Breitkopf from 1784 to 1787. About half of the chorale harmonisations in this collection have their origin in other extant works by Bach. This collection went through four more editions and countless reprintings until 1897. Several other collections of chorales by J. S. Bach were published, some of these using the original C-clefs or different texts.

The loss of musical material from Bach&#x27;s death to the first printings of chorale collections may have been substantial. Not only are many works the chorales were extracted from no longer extant but there is no way of knowing how much of all the harmonisations that were once compiled the current collections include. For example, there is no way of knowing how many of the 150 harmonisations first proposed for sale in 1764 also appear in Princess Anna Amalia&#x27;s manuscript which ultimately forms the basis of the Breitkopf edition. As to the chorale melodies with figured bass, current collections include less than one hundred of them whereas those proposed for sale in 1764 numbered 240.

The chorale harmonisations BWV 250–438 were probably all extracted from lost larger vocal works. For six of them the work they have been derived from has been identified. Bach&#x27;s chorale harmonisations are all for a four-part choir (SATB), but Riemenschneider&#x27;s and Terry&#x27;s collections contain one 5-part SSATB choral harmonisation (&quot;Welt, ade! ich bin dein müde&quot;, Riemenscheider No. 150, Terry No. 365), not actually by Bach, but used by Bach as the concluding chorale to cantata &quot;Wer weiß, wie nahe mir mein Ende&quot;, BWV 27.

Some harmonisations exist in different keys, i.e. pitches, in 18th-century sources: for instance a Bach cantata autograph gives the four-part chorale in one key, and the same harmonisation is found in one or more of the early chorale compilations in a different key.

=== Manuscripts ===
The first record of the existence and sale of groups of collected chorale harmonisations and chorale melodies with figured bass extracted from larger works by J.S. Bach is from 1764, fourteen years after Bach&#x27;s death. In that year the firm Breitkopf und Sohn announced for sale manuscript copies of 150 chorale harmonisations and 240 chorale melodies with figured bass by J.S. Bach.

In 1777 Johann Kirnberger started an active letter campaign to induce Breitkopf to publish a complete set of chorale harmonisations. Kirnberger&#x27;s letters emphasize his motivation to have the chorales printed in order to preserve them for the benefit of future generations. The manuscript to be used once belonged to C. P. E. Bach, who sold it through Kirnberger to Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia (for twelve louis d&#x27;or). It is presumed that this manuscript contained neither the text of the chorales nor any reference to the larger works from which the harmonisations had been taken. The manuscript&#x27;s harmonisations extracted only the vocal parts and ignored the instrumental parts and the continuo, even though all of Bach&#x27;s chorale settings included both instrumental parts and continuo. The instrumental parts were either independent, so called obbligato instrumental parts, or mostly doubled the vocal parts sometimes separating from it for a very few beats, and the continuo had its bass mostly double the vocal bass at the lower octave, but could also separate from it for a very few beats. Finally in some cases, for reasons unknown, whoever extracted the chorale from the larger work, changed the key of the setting.

; &quot;Y&quot; manuscript hypothesis : Hypothetical early autograph collection of chorale harmonisations from which Bach would have selected settings he later integrated into his larger vocal works.

; Larger vocal works manuscripts : Mostly extant as autograph score and/or as parts written out under Bach&#x27;s supervision: many of these works, such as cantatas and Passions, include four-part chorales

; &quot;Three Wedding Chorales&quot; autograph : Bach&#x27;s autograph of the wedding chorales BWV 250–252, written between 1734 and 1738.

; Dietel manuscript, a.k.a. Dietel Collection and, in German, Choralsammlung Dietel
: Earliest of the extant larger collection of chorale harmonisations manuscripts. It contains 149 chorale harmonisations (not 150 as is written on its title page) and originated around 1735. The music in the manuscript was copied by Johann Ludwig Dietel, one of Bach&#x27;s pupils from the Thomasschule.

=== Printed editions ===
A few chorale harmonisations had been published before Bach adopted them into his larger vocal works, and are therefore listed as spurious in the third annex of the BWV catalogue:
* , also known as closing movement of cantata BWV 27: five-part harmonisation published, for instance, in Vopelius&#x27; 1682 &quot;Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch&quot;, p. 947.
* Cantata BWV 43, movement 11: harmonisation by published in 1652, later adopted in Vopelius&#x27; &quot;Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch&quot;: &quot;Ermuntre dich, mein schwacher Geist&quot;, p. 70.
* Cantata BWV 8, movement 6 (BWV 8/6): Daniel Vetter&#x27;s four-part setting of &quot;Liebster Gott, wann werd ich sterben&quot;, published in 1713.
Several more harmonisations stay close to the version published by Vopelius: for example &quot;Christus, der ist mein Leben&quot;, BWV 281, is a variant of the harmonisation found in the &quot;Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch&quot;, with added embellishments and the harmonic structure altered for one of the tune&#x27;s four phrases.

Printed collections of Bach&#x27;s harmonisations usually provide an alphabetical collation of the chorales, that is, ranged alphabetically by text incipit of the hymn. Some editions contain an alphabetical index at the end of the compilation, for instance at the end of the final volume of C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s 18th-century collection. Other editions, such as the Breitkopf compilations of 1892 and 1899, present the chorales themselves in alphabetical order. However, not all of these alphabetical collations result in analogous chorale sequences. Some major differences in this respect result from chorales that are known by different names: in that case it depends on the editor which name is used for the collation. For example, the melody of &quot;Ach, lieben Christen, seid getrost&quot; also being known as &quot;Wo Gott der Herr nicht bei uns hält&quot; it is an editor&#x27;s discretion whether BWV 256 is found early on or near the end of an alphabetically sorted collection.

==== 18th century ====

Some of Bach&#x27;s voice and thoroughbass settings published in Georg Christian Schemelli&#x27;s 1736 &quot;Musicalisches Gesang-Buch&quot; are better known in their four-part realisation included in the chorale harmonisation collections.

; Chorales published by Birnstiel (200) : In 1765 F. W. Birnstiel published 100 chorales in Berlin. The edition had been initiated by F. W. Marpurg and completed, edited and supplemented with a preface and a list of errata by C. P. E. Bach. A second volume of 100 was issued by the same publisher in 1769, edited by J. F. Agricola. C. P. E. Bach criticised this publication as being full of mistakes in an article which was published in Hamburg in the &quot;Staats- und Gelehrte Zeitung des Hamburgischen unpartheyeschen Correspondenten&quot; on 30 May 1769, in which he also claimed that some of the chorale harmonisations included in the volume had not been composed by his father.

; C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s edition for Breitkopf (371) : After Kirnberger died in 1783, C. P. E. Bach became Breitkopf&#x27;s editor for the chorales, which he then published in four parts:
:* Vol. I (1784): Nos. 1–96
:* Vol. II (1785): Nos. 97–194
:* Vol. III (1786): Nos. 195–283
:* Vol. IV (1787): Nos. 283–370
: Since the number 283 was used twice (last number of Vol. III and first number of Vol. IV), the collection actually contained 371 items. The collection also contained several doubles (e.g. No. 156 is identical to No. 307): it totalled 348 independent harmonisations.

==== 19th century ====
C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s selection of 371 chorale harmonisations was republished a few times in the 19th century, for instance by Carl Ferdinand Becker in 1832 (third edition), and by Alfred Dörffel in 1870.

; Bach Gesellschaft (larger vocal works + 3 + 185): The Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA, Bach Gesellschaft edition) kept the chorale settings that were part of a larger vocal work (cantata, motet, Passion or oratorio) together with these larger vocal works and added the &quot;Three Wedding Chorales&quot; to its 13th volume containing wedding cantatas. The remaining separate four-part chorales, purged from doubles, were ordered alphabetically and numbered from 1 to 185 in the 39th volume which was published in 1892.

; Richter&#x27;s edition for Breitkopf (389) : In the late 19th century Bernhard Friedrich Richter collected all straightforward chorale harmonisations that had appeared in the BGA edition —including as well the separate ones as those from larger vocal works—, added a &quot;Herr Gott, dich loben alle wir&quot; harmonisation from a variant version of Cantata 130, and numbered all of these chorales in alphabetical order. The set contained a few doubtful and spurious settings (e.g. from Telemann cantatas which at the time were still attributed to Bach), but four-part settings which were part of a more complex texture (e.g. the fifth movement of Cantata 22 where the vocal homophony is supplemented by instrumental figuration) were not always included by Richter. The set was published by Breitkopf as &quot;Joh. Seb. Bach: 389 Choral-Gesänge für gemischten Chor&quot; in 1899.

==== 20th century ====
The &quot;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot;, published in 1950, did not assign a separate BWV number to harmonisations contained in extant larger vocal works such as cantatas and Passions. The &quot;Three Wedding Chorales&quot; were assigned the numbers 250 to 252, and the 185 (+1: see below) four-part chorales contained in Vol. 39 of the BGA edition were given, in the same order, the numbers 253 to 438.

; Terry (405) : Published in 1929, Charles Sanford Terry&#x27;s &quot;J. S. Bach&#x27;s Four-Part Chorales&quot; contains 405 chorale harmonisations and 95 melodies with figured bass. The collection was reprinted 1964, with a foreword by Walter Emery.

; Riemenschneider (371) : Albert Riemenschneider&#x27;s collection of 371 chorales was published in 1941. It contained the same 371 settings as the C. P. E. Bach edition for Breitkopf, but with a few differences in the collation. In some cases Riemenschneider restored some information about obbligato instrumental parts based on extant larger works, e.g. his No. 270 from cantata BWV 161, or about the continuo bass line if this does not exactly coincide with the vocal bass, e.g. his No. 29 from cantata BWV 32 and his No. 35 from the &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;. Riemenschneider did however not restore original keys to the extant larger works, but instead kept the chorales in the keys as they had been published in the Breitkopf collection, e.g. his No. 22, in E-flat major, comes from cantata BWV 180 where it is in F major. At times the key signature in Riemenschneider&#x27;s edition does not correspond to the key, for instance No. 19, in G minor but written with a &quot;Dorian&quot; G key signature. This too is presumably reproduced from the Breitkopf edition, which would have followed a common 17th- and 18th-century practice.

; Editio Musica Budapest (388) : Editio Musica Budapest (EMB) published Imre Sulyok&#x27;s edition of 388 chorale harmonisations in 1982. With a few differences (e.g. a de-doubling of the near-identical BWV 253 and 414, and some differences in the collation) the collection is largely comparable to the Richter edition.

; Kalmus (389) : Kalmus republished the 389 chorales of Richter&#x27;s collection.

; NBA : The New Bach Edition published the &quot;Three Wedding Chorales&quot; and the four-part chorales contained in the Dietel collection in 1991 (Series III, Vol. 2/1). The chorales from C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s collection were published in 1996 (Series III, Vol. 2/2). Vol. 3 of the same series, published in 2002, contains a few chorales of doubtful authenticity found in other manuscripts and early editions. Vol. 9 of the second series, published in 2000, contains a few doubtful chorales found in various Passions. Better known chorale harmonisations are also contained in other volumes of series I (cantatas), II (Passions and oratorios) and V (e.g. BWV 299 as contained in the &quot;Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach&quot;).

== Chorale harmonisations in various collections ==

Most of Bach&#x27;s known chorale harmonisations are movements in his extant cantatas, motets, Passions and oratorios. These are compositions which have a BWV number ranging from 1 to 249. BWV 250 to 438 is the range of the separate four-part chorales. Chorale harmonisations with a number above 438 are mostly later additions to the BWV catalogue. The 5th chapter of the 1998 edition of the &quot;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; (BWV2a) contains the chorales BWV 250–438, and some later additions (BWV 500a, 1084, 1089 and 1122–1126).

=== Numbering conventions ===

All BWV numbers used in the listings below are according to the latest version of the &quot;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; and further updates of these numbers found at the Bach Digital website. When a BWV number is followed by a slash (&quot;/&quot;), the number or letter after that slash indicates the movement in the composition.

Settings from &quot;Schemellis Gesangbuch&quot; are indicated by their BWV number (BWV 439–507), by the number of the hymn in the original publication (Nos. 1–954), and, between brackets, the number of the setting in Vol. 39 of the BGA edition (1–69).

A cross-reference between Lutheran hymns, their Zahn number, and their appearance in compositions by Bach (including, but not limited to, the chorale harmonisations) can be found pp. 471–481 of BWV2a.

=== In larger vocal works ===
More than 200 of Bach&#x27;s over 400 homophonic chorale harmonisations survived in his larger vocal works.

==== In church cantatas ====

<text>A trade agreement (also known as trade pact) is a wide-ranging taxes, tariff and trade treaty that often includes investment guarantees. It exists when two or more countries agree on terms that help them trade with each other. The most common trade agreements are of the preferential and free trade types, which are concluded in order to reduce (or eliminate) tariffs, quotas and other trade restrictions on items traded between the signatories.

The logic of formal trade agreements is that they outline what is agreed upon and specify the punishments for deviation from the rules set in the agreement. Trade agreements therefore make misunderstandings less likely, and create confidence on both sides that cheating will be punished; this increases the likelihood of long-term cooperation. An international organization, such as the IMF, can further incentivize cooperation by monitoring compliance with agreements and reporting third countries of the violations. Monitoring by international agencies may be needed to detect non-tariff barriers, which are disguised attempts at creating trade barriers.

Trade pacts are frequently politically contentious, as they might pit the winners and losers of an agreement against each other. Aside from their provisions on reducing tariffs, contentious issues in modern free trade agreements may revolve around regulatory harmonization on issues such as intellectual property regulations, labour rights, and environmental and safety regulations. Increasing efficiency and economic gains through free trade is a common goal.

The anti-globalization movement opposes trade agreements almost by definition, although some groups normally allied within that movement, such as leftist parties, might support fair trade or safe trade provisions that moderate real and perceived ill effects of globalization. In response to criticism, free trade agreements have increasingly over time come with measures that seek to reduce the negative externalities of trade liberalization.

== Classification of trade pacts ==

===By number and type of signatories===
There are three different types of trade agreements. The first is &quot;unilateral&quot; trade agreement, this is what happens when a country wants certain restrictions to be enforced but no other countries want them to be imposed. This also allows countries to decrease the amount of trade restrictions. That is also something that does not happen often and could impair a country.

The second type is a bilateral trade agreement, when signed by two parties, where each party may be a country (or other customs territory), a trade bloc or an informal group of countries (or other customs territories). Both countries loosen their trade restrictions to help businesses, so that they can prosper better between the different countries. This definitely helps lower taxes and it helps them converse about their trade status. Usually, this revolves around subsided domestic industries. Mainly the industries fall under automotive, oil, or food industries.

A trade agreement signed between more than two sides (typically neighboring or in the same region) is classified as &quot;multilateral&quot;. These face the most obstacles- when negotiating substance, and for implementation. The more countries that are involved, the harder it is to reach mutual satisfaction. Once this type of trade agreement is settled on, it becomes a very powerful agreement. The larger the GDP of the signatories, the greater the impact on other global trade relationships. The largest multilateral trade agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement, involving the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

=== By geographical region ===
These are between countries in a certain area. The most powerful ones include a few countries that are near each other in a geographical area. These countries often have similar histories, demographics and economic goals.

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was established on January 1, 1989, between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This agreement was designed to reduce tariff barriers in North America.

The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) was established in 2015 and currently consists of five member states: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. It is designed to foster economic integration among its member states and promote economic growth in the region.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was formed in 1967 between the countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. It was established to promote political partnership and maintain economic stability throughout the region.

===By level of integration===
There are a variety of trade agreements; with some being quite complex (European Union), while others are less intensive (North American Free Trade Agreement). The resulting level of economic integration depends on the specific type of trade pacts and policies adopted by the trade bloc:

# Separate
#*Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)
#*Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT)
#*Preferential Trade Arrangement (PTA)–limited scope and depth of tariffs reduction between the customs territories.
#**Free Trade Agreement establishing a Free Trade Area (FTA)–extensive reduction or elimination of tariffs on substantially all trade allowing for the free movement of goods and in more advanced agreements also reduction of restrictions on investment and establishment allowing for the free movement of capital and free movement of services
#***Common market–FTA with significantly reduced or eliminated restrictions on the freedom of movement of all factors of production, including free movement of labour and of enterprise; and coordination in economic policy
#*Currency union–sharing the same currency
# Composite
#*Customs union–FTA with common external tariffs of all signatories in respect to non-signatory countries
#**Customs and monetary union–Customs union with Currency union
#**Economic union–Customs union with Common market
#***Economic and monetary union (EMU)–Economic union with Currency Union
#****Fiscal union–common coordination of substantial parts of the fiscal policies &quot;(proposed step between EMU and Complete economic integration)&quot;

===Special agreements===
*World Trade Organization treaty
**agreements in the WTO framework (Textile Agreement and others)
* the now defunct Multilateral Agreement on Investment (in the OECD framework)

===By the World Trade Organization===
Typically the benefits and obligations of the trade agreements apply only to their signatories.

In the framework of the World Trade Organization, different agreement types are concluded (mostly during new member accessions), whose terms apply to all WTO members on the so-called most-favored basis (MFN), which means that beneficial terms agreed bilaterally with one trading partner will apply also to the rest of the WTO members.

All agreements concluded outside of the WTO framework (and granting additional benefits beyond the WTO MFN level, but applicable only between the signatories and not to the rest of the WTO members) are called &quot;preferential&quot; by the WTO. According to WTO rules, these agreements are subject to certain requirements such as notification to the WTO and general reciprocity (the preferences should apply equally to each of the signatories of the agreement) where unilateral preferences (some of the signatories gain preferential access to the market of the other signatories, without lowering their own tariffs) are allowed only under exceptional circumstances and as temporary measure.

The trade agreements called &quot;preferential&quot; by the WTO are also known as &quot;regional&quot; (RTA), despite not necessarily concluded by countries within a certain region. There are currently 205 agreements in force as of July 2007. Over 300 have been reported to the WTO. The number of FTA has increased significantly over the last decade. Between 1948 and 1994, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the predecessor to the WTO, received 124 notifications. Since 1995 over 300 trade agreements have been enacted.

The WTO is further classifying these agreements in the following types:

*&quot;Goods covering&quot;:
** basic &quot;preferential trade agreement&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;partial scope agreement&quot;)
**&quot;free trade agreement&quot;
**&quot;customs union&quot;
*&quot;Services covering&quot;:
**&quot;Economic Integration Agreement&quot;–any agreement, including a basic PTA, that covers also services

<doc id="217091" wikidata="Q2916335" url="?curid=217091" title="List of songs and arias by Johann Sebastian Bach">
<text>Songs and arias by Johann Sebastian Bach are compositions listed in Chapter 6 of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV 439–524), which also includes the Quodlibet. Most of the songs and arias included in this list are set for voice and continuo. Most of them are also spiritual, i.e. hymn settings, although a few have a worldly theme. The best known of these, &quot;Bist du bei mir&quot;, was however not composed by Bach.

An aria by Bach was rediscovered in the 21st century, and was assigned the number BWV 1127. Further hymn settings and arias by Bach are included in his cantatas, motets, masses, passions, oratorios and chorale harmonisations (BWV 1–438 and later additions). The second Anhang of the BWV catalogue also lists a few songs of doubtful authenticity.

==Songs, arias and Quodlibet, BWV 439–524==

<doc id="217094" wikidata="Q497878" url="?curid=217094" title="Muryeong of Baekje">
<text>Muryeong (461/462–523, r. 501–23) was the 25th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. During his reign, Baekje remained allied with Silla against Goguryeo, and expanded its relationships with China and Japan. According to Samguk sagi, King Muryeong&#x27;s height was recorded as 8 feet (190 cm). 

==Background==
The Tomb of King Muryeong calls him King Sama (斯麻), and records his birth year as 462.

The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; calls him King Muryeong, with the personal name () of Sama (斯摩). He is described as the second son of the 24th king Dongseong. He became king when Dongseong was assassinated by the court official Baekga. The following year, he crushed a planned rebellion by Baekga.

===Other records===
China&#x27;s &quot;Liang shu&quot; gives his surname as Yeo and personal name as Yung, and states that he restored Baekje into a strong nation.

Japan&#x27;s &quot;Nihonshoki&quot; gives his birthdate as 25 June 461, and describes him as the son of the 21st king Gaero. It is recorded Buyeo Gonji, the brother of King Gaero went to Japan to serve Emperor Yūryaku with King Muryeong&#x27;s mother, and she went into labor as their ship was passing by a small Japanese island. He was called Semakishi (嶋君) and King Shima (斯麻王) in Japanese records because he was born in an island.

==Reign==

In 501, he sent an army to attack Goguryeo&#x27;s Sugok-seong. In 503, he repelled an attack by the Mohe. In 507, he successfully countered another attack by Goguryeo and Mohe forces. In 512, Goguryeo conquered two castles, but Muryeong personally led 3,000 men to destroy the Goguryeo army. In 523, he ordered the building of a fortified wall to defend the northern border.

According to both historical and archeological sources, contact and trade between China and Baekje increased during Muryeong&#x27;s reign. In 512, according to the &quot;Liang shu&quot;, Muryeong sent Baekje&#x27;s first mission to the newly established court of the Chinese Liang Dynasty. A second mission was sent in 521, announcing various victories over Goguryeo. In reply, the Liang emperor bestowed various titles on him, including &quot;Great General Tranquilizing the East (寧東大將軍)&quot; and &quot;King of Baekje&quot;. These titles were also found engraved on a tablet in King Muryeong&#x27;s tomb.

In 503, he sent a bronze mirror, and in 513 and 516, Confucian scholars to Japan.

==Legacy==

In 1971, King Muryeong&#x27;s tomb was excavated in Songsan-ri, Gongju, South Korea, where he was buried with his queen.
In 2001, Japan&#x27;s emperor Akihito told reporters &quot;I, on my part, feel a certain kinship with Korea, given that it is recorded in the &quot;Chronicles of Japan&quot; that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was one of the descendant of King Muryong of Baekje.&quot; It was the first time that a Japanese emperor publicly referred a Korean blood in the imperial line. According to the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;, Emperor Kanmu&#x27;s mother, Takano no Niigasa (720 – 790) is a descendant of Prince Junda, son of Muryeong, who died in Japan in 513 (Nihon Shoki Chapter 17).

==Family==

<text>In welfare economics and social choice theory, a social welfare function—also called a social ordering, ranking, utility, or choice function—is a function that ranks a set of social states by their desirability. Each person&#x27;s preferences are combined in some way to determine which outcome is considered better by society as a whole. It can be seen as mathematically formalizing Rousseau&#x27;s idea of a general will.

Social choice functions are studied by economists as a way to identify socially-optimal decisions, giving a procedure to rigorously define which of two outcomes should be considered better for society as a whole (e.g. to compare two different possible income distributions). They are also used by democratic governments to choose between several options in elections, based on the preferences of voters; in this context, a social choice function is typically referred to as an electoral system.

The notion of social utility is analogous to the notion of a utility function in consumer choice. However, a social welfare function is different in that it is a mapping of &quot;individual&quot; utility functions onto a single output, in a way that accounts for the judgments of everyone in a society.

There are two different notions of social welfare used by economists:
* [[Social welfare function|Ordinal]] (or ranked voting) functions only use ordinal information, i.e. whether one choice is better than another.
* [[Social welfare function|Cardinal]] (or rated voting) functions also use cardinal information, i.e. how much better one choice is compared to another.
Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem is a key result on social welfare functions, showing an important difference between social and consumer choice: whereas it is possible to construct a rational (non-self-contradictory) decision procedure for consumers based only on ordinal preferences, it is impossible to do the same in the social choice setting, making any such ordinal decision procedure a second-best.

== Terminology and equivalence ==
Some authors maintain a distinction between three closely-related concepts: 

# A social &quot;choice&quot; function selects a single best outcome (a single candidate who wins, or multiple if there happens to be a tie).
# A social &quot;ordering&quot; function lists the candidates, from best to worst.
# A social &quot;scoring&quot; function maps each candidate to a number representing their quality. For example, the standard social scoring function for first-preference plurality is the total number of voters who rank a candidate first.

Every social ordering can be made into a choice function by considering only the highest-ranked outcome. Less obviously, though, every social choice function is also an ordering function. Deleting the best outcome, then finding the new winner, results in a runner-up who is assigned second place. Repeating this process gives a full ranking of all candidates.

Because of this close relationship, the three kinds of functions are often conflated by abuse of terminology.

=== Example ===
Consider an instant-runoff election between Top, Center, and Bottom. Top has the most first-preference votes; Bottom has the second-most; and Center (positioned between the two) has the fewest first preferences. 

Under instant-runoff voting, Top is the winner. Center is eliminated in the first round, and their second-preferences are evenly split between Top and Bottom, allowing Top to win.

To find the second-place finisher, we find the winner if Top had not run. In this case, the election is between Center and Bottom.

(Note that the finishing order is not the same as the elimination order for sequential elimination methods: despite being eliminated first, Center is the runner-up in this election.)

==Ordinal welfare==

In a 1938 article, Abram Bergson introduced the term &quot;social welfare function,&quot; with the intention &quot;to state in precise form the value judgments required for the derivation of the conditions of maximum economic welfare.&quot; The function was real-valued and differentiable. It was specified to describe the society as a whole. Arguments of the function included the quantities of different commodities produced and consumed and of resources used in producing different commodities, including labor.

Necessary general conditions are that at the maximum value of the function:
* The marginal &quot;dollar&#x27;s worth&quot; of welfare is equal for each individual and for each commodity
* The marginal &quot;dis-welfare&quot; of each &quot;dollar&#x27;s worth&quot; of labor is equal for each commodity produced of each labor supplier
* The marginal &quot;dollar&quot; cost of each unit of resources is equal to the marginal value productivity for each commodity.
Bergson argued that welfare economics had described a standard of economic efficiency despite dispensing with &quot;interpersonally-comparable&quot; cardinal utility, the hypothesization of which may merely conceal value judgments, and purely subjective ones at that.

Earlier neoclassical welfare theory, heir to the classical utilitarianism of Bentham, often treated the law of diminishing marginal utility as implying interpersonally comparable utility. Irrespective of such comparability, income or wealth &quot;is&quot; measurable, and it was commonly inferred that redistributing income from a rich person to a poor person tends to increase total utility (however measured) in the society. But Lionel Robbins (1935, ch. VI) argued that how or how much utilities, as mental events, change relative to each other is not measurable by any empirical test, making them unfalsifiable. Robbins therefore rejected such as incompatible with his own philosophical behaviorism.

Auxiliary specifications enable comparison of different social states by each member of society in preference satisfaction. These help define &quot;Pareto efficiency&quot;, which holds if all alternatives have been exhausted to put at least one person in a more preferred position with no one put in a less preferred position. Bergson described an &quot;economic welfare increase&quot; (later called a &quot;Pareto improvement&quot;) as at least one individual moving to a more preferred position with everyone else indifferent. The social welfare function could then be specified in a &quot;substantively&quot; individualistic sense to derive Pareto efficiency (optimality). Paul Samuelson (2004, p. 26) notes that Bergson&#x27;s function &quot;could derive Pareto optimality conditions as &quot;necessary&quot; but not sufficient for defining interpersonal normative equity.&quot; Still, Pareto efficiency could also characterize &quot;one&quot; dimension of a particular social welfare function with distribution of commodities among individuals characterizing &quot;another&quot; dimension. As Bergson noted, a welfare improvement from the social welfare function could come from the &quot;position of some individuals&quot; improving at the expense of others. That social welfare function could then be described as characterizing an equity dimension.

Samuelson (1947, p. 221) himself stressed the flexibility of the social welfare function to characterize &quot;any&quot; one ethical belief, Pareto-bound or not, consistent with:
* a complete and transitive ranking (an ethically &quot;better&quot;, &quot;worse&quot;, or &quot;indifferent&quot; ranking) of all social alternatives and
* one set out of an infinity of welfare indices and cardinal indicators to characterize the belief.
As Samuelson (1983, p. xxii) notes, Bergson clarified how production and consumption efficiency conditions are distinct from the interpersonal ethical values of the social welfare function.

Samuelson further sharpened that distinction by specifying the &quot;welfare function&quot; and the &quot;possibility function&quot; (1947, pp. 243–49). Each has as arguments the set of utility functions for everyone in the society. Each can (and commonly does) incorporate Pareto efficiency. The possibility function also depends on technology and resource restraints. It is written in implicit form, reflecting the &quot;feasible&quot; locus of utility combinations imposed by the restraints and allowed by Pareto efficiency. At a given point on the possibility function, if the utility of all but one person is determined, the remaining person&#x27;s utility is determined. The welfare function ranks different hypothetical &quot;sets&quot; of utility for everyone in the society from ethically lowest on up (with ties permitted), that is, it makes interpersonal comparisons of utility. Welfare maximization then consists of maximizing the welfare function subject to the possibility function as a constraint. The same welfare maximization conditions emerge as in Bergson&#x27;s analysis.

Kenneth Arrow&#x27;s 1963 book demonstrated the problems with such an approach, though he would not immediately realize this. Along earlier lines, Arrow&#x27;s version of a social welfare function, also called a &#x27;constitution&#x27;, maps a set of individual orderings (ordinal utility functions) for everyone in society to a social ordering, which ranks alternative social states (such as which of several candidates should be elected).

Arrow found that contrary to the assertions of Lionel Robbins and other behaviorists, dropping the requirement of real-valued (and thus cardinal) social orderings makes rational or coherent behavior at the social level impossible. This result is now known as Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem&quot;.&quot; Arrow&#x27;s theorem shows that it is impossible for an ordinal social welfare function to satisfy a standard axiom of rational behavior, called independence of irrelevant alternatives. This axiom says that changing the value of one outcome should not affect choices that do not involve this outcome. For example, if a customer buys apples because he prefers them to blueberries, telling them that cherries are on sale should not make them buy blueberries instead of apples.

John Harsanyi later strengthened this result by showing that if societies must make decisions under uncertainty, the unique social welfare function satisfying coherence and Pareto efficiency is the utilitarian rule.

==Cardinal welfare==
A cardinal social welfare function is a function that takes as input numeric representations of individual utilities (also known as cardinal utility), and returns as output a numeric representation of the collective welfare. The underlying assumption is that individuals utilities can be put on a common scale and compared. Examples of such measures include life expectancy or per capita income.

For the purposes of this section, income is adopted as the measurement of utility.

The form of the social welfare function is intended to express a statement of objectives of a society.

The utilitarian or Benthamite social welfare function measures social welfare as the total or sum of individual utilities:
:formula_1
where formula_2 is social welfare and formula_3 is the income of individual formula_4 among formula_5 individuals in society. In this case, maximizing the social welfare means maximizing the total income of the people in the society, without regard to how incomes are distributed in society. It does not distinguish between an income transfer from rich to poor and vice versa. If an income transfer from the poor to the rich results in a bigger increase in the utility of the rich than the decrease in the utility of the poor, the society is expected to accept such a transfer, because the total utility of the society has increased as a whole. Alternatively, society&#x27;s welfare can also be measured under this function by taking the average of individual incomes:
:formula_6

In contrast, the max-min or Rawlsian social welfare function (based on the philosophical work of John Rawls) measures the social welfare of society on the basis of the welfare of the least well-off individual member of society:
:formula_7
Here maximizing societal welfare would mean maximizing the income of the poorest person in society without regard for the income of other individuals.

These two social welfare functions express very different views about how a society would need to be organised in order to maximize welfare, with the first emphasizing total incomes and the second emphasizing the needs of the worst-off. The max-min welfare function can be seen as reflecting an extreme form of uncertainty aversion on the part of society as a whole, since it is concerned only with the worst conditions that a member of society could face.

Amartya Sen proposed a welfare function in 1973:
:formula_8
The average per capita income of a measured group (e.g. nation) is multiplied with formula_9 where formula_10 is the Gini index, a relative inequality measure. James E. Foster (1996) proposed to use one of Atkinson&#x27;s Indexes, which is an entropy measure. Due to the relation between Atkinsons entropy measure and the Theil index, Foster&#x27;s welfare function also can be computed directly using the Theil-L Index.

:formula_11

The value yielded by this function has a concrete meaning. There are several possible incomes which could be earned by a &quot;person&quot;, who randomly is selected from a population with an unequal distribution of incomes. This welfare function marks the income, which a randomly selected person is most likely to have. Similar to the median, this income will be smaller than the average per capita income.

:formula_12

Here the Theil-T index is applied. The inverse value yielded by this function has a concrete meaning as well. There are several possible incomes to which a &quot;Euro&quot; may belong, which is randomly picked from the sum of all unequally distributed incomes. This welfare function marks the income, which a randomly selected Euro most likely belongs to. The inverse value of that function will be larger than the average per capita income.

=== Axioms of cardinal welfarism ===
Suppose we are given a preference relation &quot;R&quot; on utility profiles. &quot;R&quot; is a weak total order on utility profiles—it can tell us, given any two utility profiles, if they are indifferent or one of them is better than the other. A reasonable preference ordering should satisfy several axioms:

1. Monotonicity: if the utility of one individual increases, while all other utilities remain equal, &quot;R&quot; should strictly prefer the second profile. For example, it should prefer the profile (1, 4, 4, 5) to (1, 2, 4, 5). Such a change is called a Pareto improvement.

2. Symmetry: reordering or relabeling the values in the utility profile should not change the output of &quot;R&quot;. This axiom formalizes the idea that every person should be treated equally in society. For example, &quot;R&quot; should be indifferent between (1, 4, 4, 5) and (5, 4, 4, 1), since these profiles are reorders of each other. 

3. Continuity: for every profile &quot;v&quot;, the set of profiles weakly better than &quot;v&quot; and the set of profiles weakly worse than &quot;v&quot; are closed sets.

4. Independence of unconcerned agents: &quot;R&quot; should be independent of individuals whose utilities have not changed. For example, if &quot;R&quot; prefers (2, 2, 4) to (1, 3, 4), it also prefers (2, 2, 9) to (1, 3, 9); the utility of agent 3 should not affect the comparison between two utility profiles of agents 1 and 2. This property can also be called locality or separability. It allows us to treat allocation problems in a local way, and separate them from the allocation in the rest of society.

Every preference relation with properties 1–4 can be represented as by a function &quot;W&quot; which is a sum of the form:
:formula_13
where &quot;w&quot; is a continuous increasing function.

=== Harsanyi&#x27;s theorem ===
Introducing one additional axiom—the nonexistence of Dutch Books, or equivalently that social choice behaves according to the axioms of rational choice—implies that the social choice function must be the utilitarian rule, i.e. the weighting function formula_14 must be equal to the utility functions of each individual. This result is known as Harsanyi&#x27;s utilitarian theorem.

=== Non-utilitarian ===
By Harsanyi&#x27;s theorem, any non-utilitarian social choice function will be incoherent; in other words, it will agree to some bets that are unanimously opposed by every member of society. However, it is still possible to establish properties of such functions. 

Instead of imposing rational behavior on the social utility function, we can impose a weaker criterion called independence of common scale: the relation between two utility profiles does not change if both of them are multiplied by the same constant. For example, the utility function should not depend on whether we measure incomes in cents or dollars.

If the preference relation has properties 1–5, then the function &quot;w&quot; must be the isoelastic function:

formula_15

This family has some familiar members:
* The limit when formula_16 is the &quot;leximin&quot; ordering.
* For formula_17 we get the Nash bargaining solution—maximizing the product of utilities.
* For formula_18 we get the utilitarian welfare function—maximizing the sum of utilities.
* The limit when formula_19 is the &quot;leximax&quot; ordering.

If we require the Pigou–Dalton principle (that inequality is not a positive good) then formula_20 in the above family must be at most 1.

<text>A public bad, in economics, is the symmetrical opposite of a public good. Air pollution is the most obvious example since it is non-excludable and non-rival, and negatively affects welfare.

Whereas public goods are typically under-provided by decentralized decision making (the market), public bad will generally be over-provided, since the parties generating the public bad do not account for the negative effects (or externality) imposed on others. One possibility to mitigate the existence of public bad is the intervention of a third party, typically the state.

In &quot;green economics&quot;, it is a good that produces socially undesirable results (or an externality in standard economics). Most &quot;green economists&quot; advise measuring such impacts back to the present from the seventh generation. Thus in the golf course example, both the recreation and the negative impacts from deforestation, associated habitat and biodiversity loss, and pesticide toxicity would be estimated across those generations and some amortization applied to determine whether the golf course was a public benefit or a public bad from the point of view of that seventh generation.

Green economists argue that the costs of public bads are hidden as externalities from the businesses that cause them — meaning the market is not working correctly. The legal challenge is to create a system that takes into account these costs. The United States Environmental Protection Agency is an example of an attempt to make sure the costs of public bads are taken into account, although some groups on the right and left have criticized the value of its efforts.

<doc id="217115" wikidata="Q7519600" url="?curid=217115" title="Ordination">
<text>Ordination is the process by which individuals are consecrated, that is, set apart and elevated from the laity class to the clergy, who are thus then authorized (usually by the denominational hierarchy composed of other clergy) to perform various religious rites and ceremonies. The process and ceremonies of ordination vary by religion and denomination. One who is in preparation for, or who is undergoing the process of ordination is sometimes called an ordinand. The liturgy used at an ordination is commonly found in a book known as an Ordinal which provides the ordo (ritual and rubrics) for celebrations.

==Christianity==

===Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican churches===

In Catholicism and Orthodoxy, ordination is one of the seven sacraments, variously called holy orders or &quot;cheirotonia&quot; (&quot;Laying on of Hands&quot;).

Apostolic succession is considered an essential and necessary concept for ordination in the Catholic, Orthodox, High Church Lutheran, Moravian, and Anglican traditions, with the belief that all ordained clergy are ordained by bishops who were ordained by other bishops tracing back to bishops ordained by the Apostles who were ordained by Christ, the great High Priest (, ), who conferred his priesthood upon his Apostles (, , , and ).

There are three ordinations in Holy Orders: deacon, presbyter, and bishop. Both bishops and presbyters are priests and have authority to celebrate the Eucharist. In common use, however, the term &quot;priest&quot;, when unqualified, refers to the order of presbyter, whereas &quot;presbyter&quot; is mainly used in rites of ordination and other places where a technical and precise term is required.

Ordination of a bishop is performed by several bishops; ordination of a priest or deacon is performed by a single bishop. The ordination of a new bishop is also called a consecration. Many ancient sources specify that at least three bishops are necessary to consecrate another, e.g., the 13th Canon of the Council of Carthage (AD 394) states, &quot;A bishop should not be ordained except by many bishops, but if there should be necessity he may be ordained by three,&quot; and the first of &quot;The Canons of the Holy and Altogether August Apostles&quot; states, &quot;Let a bishop be ordained by two or three bishops,&quot; while the second canon thereof states, &quot;Let a presbyter, deacon, and the rest of the clergy, be ordained by one bishop&quot;; the latter canons, whatever their origin, were imposed on the universal church by the Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea, in its first canon.

====Details peculiar to the various denominations====
The Catholic Church teaches that one bishop is sufficient to consecrate a new bishop validly (that is, for an episcopal ordination actually to take place). In most Christian denominations that retain the practice of ordination, only an already ordained (consecrated) bishop or the equivalent may ordain bishops, priests, and deacons. However, Canon Law requires that bishops always be consecrated with the mandate (approval) of the Pope, as the guarantor of the Church&#x27;s unity. Moreover, at least three bishops are to perform the consecration, although the Apostolic See may dispense from this requirement in extraordinary circumstances (for example, in missionary settings or times of persecution).

In the Catholic Church, those deacons destined to be ordained priests are often termed &quot;transitional deacons&quot;; those deacons who are married before being ordained, as well as any unmarried deacons who chose not to be ordained priests, are called &quot;permanent deacons&quot;. Those married deacons who become widowers have the possibility of seeking ordination to the priesthood in exceptional cases.

While some Eastern churches have in the past recognized Anglican ordinations as valid, the current Anglican practice, in many provinces, of ordaining women to the priesthood—and, in some cases, to the episcopate—has caused the Orthodox generally to question earlier declarations of validity and hopes for union. The Catholic Church has never recognized Anglican orders as valid. Anglicanism recognizes Catholic and Orthodox ordinations; hence, clergy converting to Anglicanism are not &quot;re-ordained&quot;.

With respect to Lutheranism, &quot;the Catholic Church has never officially expressed its judgement on the validity of orders as they have been handed down by episcopal succession in these two national Lutheran churches&quot; (the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland) though it does &quot;question how the ecclesiastical break in the 16th century has affected the apostolicity of the churches of the Reformation and thus the apostolicity of their ministry&quot;.

Some Eastern Orthodox churches recognize Catholic ordinations while others &quot;re-ordain&quot; Catholic clergy (as well as Anglicans) who convert. However, both the Catholic and Anglican churches recognize Orthodox ordinations.

In the Catholic and Anglican churches, ordinations have traditionally been held on Ember Days, though there is no limit to the number of clergy who may be ordained at the same service. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, ordinations may be performed any day of the year on which the Divine Liturgy may be celebrated (and deacons may also be ordained at the Presanctified Liturgy), but only one person may be ordained to each order at any given service, that is, at most one bishop, one presbyter, and one deacon may be ordained at the same liturgy.

====Notes====

* There have long existed orders of clergy below that of deacon. In the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches (and, until 1970, in the Catholic Church), a person has to be tonsured a cleric and be ordained to sundry minor orders prior to being ordained a deacon. Although a person may be said to be ordained to these orders, such ordinations are not reckoned as part of the sacrament of Holy Orders; in the Eastern Orthodox, the term &quot;Cheirothesia&quot; (&quot;imposition of hands&quot;) is used for such ordinations in contrast to &quot;Cheirotonia&quot; (&quot;laying on of hands&quot;) for ordinations of deacons, presbyters, and bishops.
* The following are positions that are not acquired by ordination:
** Becoming a monk or nun or, generally, a member of a religious order, which is open to men and women; men in religious orders may or may not be ordained. Anglican nuns may, like their male counterparts, be ordained as well. 
** Offices and titles such as pope, patriarch, archbishop, archpriest, archimandrite, archdeacon, etc., which are given to ordained persons for sundry reasons, e.g., to rank them or honor them.
** Cardinals are simply a large collegiate body who are electors of and the senior-most counselors to the Pope, and are not a fourth order beyond bishop. At presently nearly all cardinals are bishops, although several are priests, having been granted a dispensation from being ordained a bishop by the Pope (most of these were elevated by the Pope for services to the Church, and are over 80, thus not having the right to elect a pope or have active voting memberships in Vatican departments). As recently as 1899 there was a cardinal who was a deacon when he died, having been a cardinal for 41 years (Teodolfo Mertel). There have even been noble lay men, or men who only possessed minor orders (now called ministries, and carried out by seminarians and laypeople) who at one time were made cardinals. Cardinals are considered princes in diplomatic protocol and by the Church, and even if they are not ordained bishops and cannot perform episcopal functions such as ordination, they have both real and ceremonial precedence over all non-cardinal patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops. Some have discussed the possibility in Catholicism of having women serve as cardinals or, more realistically in the short-term, as sub-deacons, since they cannot be ordained.
*In the Church of England, the priest of the diocese who oversees the process of discernment, selection and training of ordinands is usually called the &quot;Diocesan Director of Ordinands&quot;, commonly shortened to &quot;DDO&quot;. He or she may have a team of assistants, who may be called Assistant DDOs or Vocations Advisers.

===Reformed, Methodist and Pentecostal churches===
In most Protestant churches, ordination is the rite by which their various churches:
* recognize and confirm that an individual has been called by God to ministry,
* acknowledge that the individual has gone through a period of discernment and training related to this call (e.g. having graduated from a seminary), and
* authorize that individual to take on the office of ministry.
For the sake of authorization and church order, and not for reason of &#x27;powers&#x27; or &#x27;ability&#x27;, individuals in most mainline Protestant churches must be ordained in order to preside at the sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion), and to be installed as a called pastor of a congregation or parish.

Some Protestant traditions have additional offices of ministry to which persons can be ordained. For instance:
* most Presbyterian and Reformed churches maintain a threefold order of ministry of pastor, elder, and deacon. The order of Pastor, the only one of the three orders considered &quot;clergy&quot;, is comparable to most other denominations&#x27; pastoral office or ordained ministry. The order of elder comprises lay persons ordained to the ministries of church order and spiritual care (for example, elders form the governing bodies of congregations and are responsible for a congregation&#x27;s worship life). In many Presbyterian churches, the pastor or minister is seen as a &quot;teaching elder&quot; and is equal to the other elders in the session. The order of deacon comprises lay persons ordained to ministries of service and pastoral care. Those who fill this position may be known as &quot;ruling elders&quot;.
* Deacons are also ordained in the Lutheran, Methodist and in most of the Baptist traditions.

For most Protestant denominations that have an office of bishop, including certain Lutheran and many Methodist churches, this is not viewed as a separate ordination or order of ministry. Rather, bishops are ordained ministers of the same order as other pastors, simply having been &quot;consecrated&quot; or installed into the &quot;office&quot; (that is, the role) of bishop. However, some Lutheran churches also claim valid apostolic succession.

Some Protestant churches – especially Pentecostal ones – have an informal tier of ministers. Those who graduate from a bible college or take a year of prescribed courses are licensed ministers. Licensed ministers are addressed as &quot;Minister&quot; and ordained ministers as &quot;Reverend.&quot; They, and also Evangelical pastors, are generally ordained at a ceremony called &quot;pastoral consecration&quot;.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses consider an adherent&#x27;s baptism to constitute ordination as a minister. Governments have generally recognized that Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; full-time appointees (such as their &quot;regular pioneers&quot;) qualify as ministers regardless of sex or appointment as an elder or deacon (&quot;ministerial servant&quot;). The religion asserts ecclesiastical privilege only for its appointed elders, but the religion permits any baptized adult male in good standing to officiate at a baptism, wedding, or funeral.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a rite of ordination is performed to bestow either the Aaronic or Melchizedek priesthood (Hebrews 5:4–6) upon a worthy male member. As in the Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox traditions, great care is taken to assure that the candidate for priesthood is ordained by those with proper authority and ordained properly and validly; thorough records of priesthood ordination are kept by the church. Ordination is performed by the laying on of hands. Ordination to the office of priest in the Aaronic priesthood gives the ordained person the authority to:
* baptize converts and children over the age of 8 into the church
* bless and administer the sacrament (the Lord&#x27;s Supper)
* participate in, or perform, ordinations of others to the Aaronic Priesthood or its offices
* collect fast offerings for the Bishop (usually ordained Deacons and Teachers perform this)

Ordination to the Melchizedek priesthood includes the authority to perform all the duties of the Aaronic priesthood, as well as ordain others to the Melchizedek or Aaronic priesthood, perform confirmations, bless and anoint the sick with oil, bless and dedicate graves, and other such rites. There are five offices within the Melchizedek Priesthood to which one could potentially be ordained:
* Elder
* High Priest
* Patriarch
* Seventy
* Apostle
&quot;Ordination to an office in the Aaronic Priesthood is done by or under the direction of the bishop or branch president. Ordination to an office in the Melchizedek Priesthood is done by or under the direction of the stake or mission president. To perform a priesthood ordination, one or more authorized priesthood holders place their hands lightly on the person&#x27;s head.&quot;

Latter-day Saints believe in a line of priesthood authority that traces back to Jesus Christ and his apostles. LDS adherents believe the church&#x27;s founder, Joseph Smith, was ordained under the hands of apostles Peter, James, and John, who appeared to Smith as angelic messengers in 1829.

==Islam==
Islam has no formal clergy or ordained religious leaders. Ordination is viewed as a distinct aspect of other religions and is rejected.

Instead, the faith’s religious leaders are usually called imams, sheikhs, or &quot;mawlānā&quot;—none of which imply ordination. The title &quot;imam&quot; (when not referring to the Shi&#x27;a doctrine of the &quot;Imamate&quot;) is given to an individual who leads Muslims in &quot;salah&quot;; the term can also be used in a linguistic sense for &quot;anyone&quot; who leads other Muslims in congregational prayers. &quot;Sheikh&quot; (, &#x27;elder&#x27; or &#x27;noble&#x27;) is an Arabic honorific title for a male Islamic scholar or tribal chieftain; &quot;shaikhah&quot; () refers to a female learned in Islamic issues. The title is usually more prevalent in Arabic countries. The word &quot;mawlana&quot; is a title bestowed upon students who have graduated from a &quot;madrasa&quot; (Islamic theological academy) throughout the Indian subcontinent. Although Muslim schools, universities, and &quot;madrasas&quot; might follow different graduation ceremonies upon a student&#x27;s completion of a 4-year undergraduate program in Islamic studies or a 7–8-year &quot;&#x27;alim&quot; course, their respective ceremonies neither symbolize nor confer ordination.

==Judaism==

The ordination of a rabbi within Judaism is referred to as &quot;semikhah&quot; (, &#x27;leaning&#x27; or &#x27;laying [of the hands]&#x27;; or &quot;semicha lerabanim&quot; , &#x27;rabbinical ordination&#x27;). The term is derived from the Hebrew verb for &quot;to lean [up]on&quot; (, &quot;lismôq&quot;) in the sense that prospective rabbis are &quot;to be authorized&quot; as Jewish religious leaders.

While the Hebrew word &quot;semikhah&quot; is rendered as &quot;ordination&quot; in English, a rabbi is not a priest &quot;per se&quot;. Rather, ordained rabbis, at least until the 20th century (when the role of rabbis expanded to included pastoral duties) primarily function as Jewish communities&#x27; decisors of Halakha (Jewish law) and Torah teachers and scholars. For many Jewish religious purposes, a rabbi&#x27;s presence is unnecessary. For example, at prayer, a &quot;minyan&quot; (quorum) of ten laypeople is both necessary and sufficient for the recital of &quot;Kaddish&quot;—thus the saying &quot;nine rabbis do not constitute a minyan, but ten cobblers can&quot;.

Recently, in some Jewish religious movements, &quot;semikhah&quot; or &quot;semicha lehazzanut&quot; may refer to the ordination of a &quot;hazzan&quot; (cantor); some use the term &quot;investiture&quot; to describe the conferral of cantorial authority rather than ordination.

==Buddhism==

The tradition of the ordained monastic community (&quot;sangha&quot;) began with the Buddha, who established orders of monks and later of nuns. The procedure of ordination in Buddhism is laid down in the Vinaya and Patimokkha or Pratimoksha scriptures. There exist three intact ordination lineages nowadays in which one can receive an ordination according to the Buddha&#x27;s teachings:
* Dharmaguptaka Lineage
* Mulasarvastivadin Lineage
* Theravada Lineage

===Mahayana===

Saicho repeatedly requested that the Japanese government allow the construction of a Mahayana ordination platform. Permission was granted in 822 CE, seven days after Saicho died. The platform was finished in 827 CE at Enryaku-ji temple on Mount Hiei, and was the first in Japan. Prior to this, those wishing to become monks/nuns were ordained using the Hinayana precepts, whereas after the Mahayana ordination platform, people were ordained with the Bodhisattva precepts as listed in the Brahma Net Sutra.

===Theravada===
&quot;Pabbajja&quot; is an ordination procedure for novice Buddhist monks in the Theravada tradition.

===Fully ordained nuns===
The legitimacy of fully ordained nuns (&quot;bhikkhuni/bhiksuni&quot;) has become a significant topic of discussion in recent years. Texts passed down in every Buddhist tradition record that Gautama Buddha created an order of fully ordained nuns, but the tradition has died out in some Buddhist traditions such as Theravada Buddhism, while remaining strong in others such as Chinese Buddhism (Dharmaguptaka lineage). In the Tibetan lineage, which follows the Mulasarvastivadin lineage, the lineage of fully ordained nuns was not brought to Tibet by the Indian Vinaya masters, hence there is no rite for the ordination of full nuns. However th 14th Dalai Lama has endeavored for many years to improve this situation. In 2005, he asked fully ordained nuns in the Dharmaguptaka lineage, especially Jampa Tsedroen, to form a committee to work for the acceptance of the &quot;bhiksuni&quot; lineage within the Tibetan tradition, and donated €50,000 for further research. The &quot;1st International Congress on Buddhist Women&#x27;s Role in the Sangha: Bhikshuni Vinaya and Ordination Lineages&quot; was held at the University of Hamburg from 18 to 20 July 2007, in cooperation with the university&#x27;s Asia-Africa Institute. Although the general tenor was that full ordination was overdue, the Dalai Lama presented a pre-drafted statement saying that more time was required to reach a decision, thus nullifying the intentions of the congress.

===Posthumous ordination===
In Medieval Sōtō Zen, a tradition of posthumous ordination was developed to give the laity access to Zen funeral rites. Chinese Ch’an monastic codes, from which Japanese Sōtō practices were derived, contain only monastic funeral rites; there were no provisions made for funerals for lay believers. To solve this problem, the Sōtō school developed the practice of ordaining laypeople after death, thus allowing monastic funeral rites to be used for them as well.

===New Kadampa Tradition===
The Buddhist ordination tradition of the New Kadampa Tradition-International Kadampa Buddhist Union (NKT-IKBU) is not the traditional Buddhist ordination, but rather one newly created by Kelsang Gyatso. Although those ordained within this organisation are called &#x27;monks&#x27; and &#x27;nuns&#x27; within the organisation, and wear the robes of traditional Tibetan monks and nuns, in terms of traditional Buddhism they are neither fully ordained monks and nuns (Skt.: bhikshu, bhikshuni; Tib.: gelong, gelongma) nor are they novice monks and nuns (Skt.: sramanera, srameneri; Tib.: gestul, getsulma).

Unlike most other Buddhist traditions, including all Tibetan Buddhist schools, which follow the Vinaya, the NKT-IKBU ordination consists of the Five Precepts of a lay person, plus five more precepts created by Kelsang Gyatso. He is said to view them as a &quot;practical condensation&quot; of the 253 Vinaya vows of fully ordained monks.

There are also no formal instructions and guidelines for the behaviour of monks and nuns within the NKT. Because the behaviour of monks and nuns is not clearly defined &quot;each Resident Teacher developed his or her own way of &#x27;disciplining&#x27; monks and nuns at their centres ...&quot;.

Kelsang Gyatso&#x27;s ordination has been publicly criticised by Geshe Tashi Tsering as going against the core teachings of Buddhism and against the teachings of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelugpa school from which Kelsang Gyatso was expelled

==Unitarian Universalism==
As Unitarian Universalism features very few doctrinal thresholds for prospective congregation members, ordinations of UU ministers are considerably less focused upon doctrinal adherence than upon factors such as possessing a Masters of Divinity degree from an accredited higher institution of education and an ability to articulate an understanding of ethics, spirituality and humanity.

In the Unitarian Universalist Association, candidates for &quot;ministerial fellowship&quot; with the denomination (usually third-year divinity school students) are reviewed, interviewed, and approved (or rejected) by the UUA Ministerial Fellowship Committee (MFC). However, given the fundamental principle of congregational polity, individual UU congregations make their own determination on ordination of ministers, and congregations may sometimes even hire or ordain persons who have not received UUA ministerial fellowship, and may or may not serve the congregation as its principal minister/pastor.

==Ordination of women==
The ordination of women is often a controversial issue in religions where either the office of ordination, or the role that an ordained person fulfills, is traditionally restricted to men, for various theological reasons.

=== In Christianity ===
The Christian priesthood has traditionally been reserved to men. Some claim that women were ordained deacons in the first millennium of Christianity, but their claims are disputed. After the Protestant Reformation and the loosening of authority structures within many denominations, most Protestant groups re-envisioned the role of the ordained priesthood. Many did away with it altogether. Others altered it in fundamental ways, often favoring a rabbinical-type married minister of teaching (word) and discarding any notion of a sacrificial priesthood. A common epithet used by Protestants (especially Anglicans) against Catholics was that Catholics were a &#x27;priest-ridden&#x27; people. Hatred for priests was a common element of anti-Catholicism and pogroms against Catholics focused on expelling, killing, or forcefully &#x27;laicizing&#x27; priests.

Beginning in the twentieth century, many Protestant denominations began re-evaluating the roles of women in their churches. Many now ordain women. According to the biblical book of Judges, a wise and brave woman named Deborah was the fourth judge of the ancient Israelites. She was instrumental in implementing a strategic military strategy that delivered the Israelites from the oppressive Canaanite king Jabin. Likewise, Jael was courageous and primary in the Israelite victory. Her prudent actions killed the commander Sisera after he fled on foot following the battle. Within the Book of Judges, there is a repetitive cycle of sin and deliverance. There is also a proposition regarding the cyclical offenses: &quot;In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes&quot; (Jdg. 21:25). Based partially upon the leadership of the prophetess, Deborah, some Protestant and non-denominational organizations grant ordination to women. Other denominations refute the claim of a precedent based on Deborah&#x27;s example because she is not specifically described as ruling over Israel, rather giving judgments on contentious issues in private, not teaching publicly, neither did she lead the military. Her message to her fellow judge Barak in fact affirmed the male leadership of Israel. The United Church of Canada has ordained women since 1932. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ordains women as pastors, and women are eligible for election as bishops. The Episcopal Church in the United States of America ordains women as deacons, priests and bishops. The Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church ordains women at all levels including deacon, priest and bishop. Other denominations leave the decision to ordain women to the regional governing body, or even to the congregation itself; these include the Christian Reformed Church in North America and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. The ordination of women in the latter half of the 20th century was an important issue between Anglicans and Catholics since the Catholic Church viewed the ordination of women as a huge obstacle to possible rapprochement between the two churches.

The Catholic Church has not changed its view or practice on the ordination or women, and neither have any of the Orthodox churches; these churches represent approximately 65% of all Christians worldwide. In response to the growing call for the ordination of women, Pope John Paul II issued the statement &quot;Ordinatio sacerdotalis&quot; in 1995. In it, he gave reasons why women cannot be ordained, and defined that the Holy Spirit had not conferred the power to ordain women upon the Church. In the wake of this definitive statement, many theologians considered the issue settled, but many continue to push for the ordination of women in the Catholic Church. Some have even begun protest churches.

=== In Judaism ===
Policy regarding the ordination of women differs among the different denominations of Judaism. Most Orthodox congregations do not allow female rabbis, while more liberal congregations began allowing female rabbis by the middle of the twentieth century.

==Ordination of LGBT persons==

Most Abrahamic religions condemn the practice of homosexuality and the Bible has been interpreted that in Romans 1 that homosexuals are &quot;worthy of death&quot;. Interpretation of this passage, as with others potentially condemning homosexuality varies greatly between and within different denominations. Beginning in the late 20th century, and more so in the early 21st century, several mainline denominational sects of Christianity and Judaism in the US and Europe endorsed the ordination of openly LGBT persons. See LGBT clergy in Christianity.

The United Church of Christ ordained openly gay Bill Johnson in 1972, and lesbian Anne Holmes in 1977.

While Buddhist ordinations of openly LGBT monks have occurred, more notable ordinations of openly LGBT novitiates have taken place in Western Buddhism.

<doc id="217116" wikidata="Q908074" url="?curid=217116" title="Dynamic equilibrium (chemistry)">
<text>In chemistry, a dynamic equilibrium exists once a reversible reaction occurs. Substances initially transition between the reactants and products at different rates until the forward and backward reaction rates eventually equalize, meaning there is no net change. Reactants and products are formed at such a rate that the concentration of neither changes. It is a particular example of a system in a steady state.

== Examples ==
In a new bottle of soda, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the liquid phase has a particular value. If half of the liquid is poured out and the bottle is sealed, carbon dioxide will leave the liquid phase at an ever-decreasing rate, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the gas phase will increase until equilibrium is reached. At that point, due to thermal motion, a molecule of CO2 may leave the liquid phase, but within a very short time another molecule of CO2 will pass from the gas to the liquid, and vice versa. At equilibrium, the rate of transfer of CO2 from the gas to the liquid phase is equal to the rate from liquid to gas. In this case, the equilibrium concentration of CO2 in the liquid is given by Henry&#x27;s law, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid. This relationship is written as
:formula_1
where &quot;K&quot; is a temperature-dependent constant, &quot;P&quot; is the partial pressure, and &quot;c&quot; is the concentration of the dissolved gas in the liquid. Thus the partial pressure of CO2 in the gas has increased until Henry&#x27;s law is obeyed. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the liquid has decreased and the drink has lost some of its fizz.

Henry&#x27;s law may be derived by setting the chemical potentials of carbon dioxide in the two phases to be equal to each other. Equality of chemical potential defines chemical equilibrium. Other constants for dynamic equilibrium involving phase changes, include partition coefficient and solubility product. Raoult&#x27;s law defines the equilibrium vapor pressure of an ideal solution

Dynamic equilibrium can also exist in a single-phase system. A simple example occurs with acid-base equilibrium such as the dissociation of acetic acid, in an aqueous solution.
: &lt;chem&gt;CH3COOH &lt;=&gt; CH3COO- + H+ &lt;/chem&gt;
At equilibrium the concentration quotient, &quot;K&quot;, the acid dissociation constant, is constant (subject to some conditions)
:formula_2
In this case, the forward reaction involves the liberation of some protons from acetic acid molecules and the backward reaction involves the formation of acetic acid molecules when an acetate ion accepts a proton. Equilibrium is attained when the sum of chemical potentials of the species on the left-hand side of the equilibrium expression is equal to the sum of chemical potentials of the species on the right-hand side. At the same time, the rates of forward and backward reactions are equal to each other. Equilibria involving the formation of chemical complexes are also dynamic equilibria and concentrations are governed by the stability constants of complexes.

Dynamic equilibria can also occur in the gas phase as, for example when nitrogen dioxide dimerizes.
:&lt;chem&gt;2NO2 &lt;=&gt; N2O4&lt;/chem&gt;; formula_3
In the gas phase, square brackets indicate partial pressure. Alternatively, the partial pressure of a substance may be written as P(substance).

==Relationship between equilibrium and rate constants==
In a simple reaction such as the isomerization:
:&lt;chem&gt; A &lt;=&gt; B &lt;/chem&gt;
there are two reactions to consider, the forward reaction in which the species A is converted into B and the backward reaction in which B is converted into A. If both reactions are elementary reactions, then the rate of reaction is given by
:formula_4
where is the rate constant for the forward reaction and is the rate constant for the backward reaction and the square brackets, , denote concentration. If only A is present at the beginning, time , with a concentration [A], the sum of the two concentrations, [A] and [B], at time , will be equal to [A].
:formula_5 

The solution to this differential equation is
:formula_6
and is illustrated at the right. As time tends towards infinity, the concentrations [A] and [B] tend towards constant values. Let approach infinity, that is, , in the expression above:
:formula_7
In practice, concentration changes will not be measurable after formula_8 Since the concentrations do not change thereafter, they are, by definition, equilibrium concentrations. Now, the equilibrium constant for the reaction is defined as
:formula_9
It follows that the equilibrium constant is numerically equal to the quotient of the rate constants.
:formula_10
In general, there may be more than one forward reaction and more than one backward reaction. Atkins states that, for a general reaction, the overall equilibrium constant is related to the rate constants of the elementary reactions by
:formula_11

<text>A minesweeper is a small warship designed to remove or detonate naval mines. Using various mechanisms intended to counter the threat posed by naval mines, minesweepers keep waterways clear for safe shipping.

==History==
The earliest known usage of the naval mine dates to the Ming dynasty. Dedicated minesweepers, however, only appeared many centuries later during the Crimean War, when they were deployed by the British. The Crimean War minesweepers were rowboats trailing grapnels to snag mines. Minesweeping technology picked up in the Russo-Japanese War, using aging torpedo boats as minesweepers.

In Britain, naval leaders recognized before the outbreak of World War I that the development of sea mines was a threat to the nation&#x27;s shipping and began efforts to counter the threat. Sir Arthur Wilson noted the real threat of the time was a blockade aided by mines and not an invasion. The function of the fishing fleet&#x27;s trawlers with their trawl gear was recognized as having a natural connection with mine clearance and, among other things, trawlers were used to keep the English Channel clear of mines. A Trawler Section of the Royal Navy Reserve became the predecessor of the mine sweeping forces with specially designed ships and equipment to follow. These reserve Trawler Section fishermen and their trawlers were activated, supplied with mine gear, rifles, and uniforms, and paid as the first minesweepers. The dedicated, purpose-built minesweeper first appeared during World War I with the Flower-class minesweeping sloop. By the end of the war, however, naval mine technology had grown beyond the ability of minesweepers to detect and remove mines.

Minesweeping made significant advancements during World War II. Combatant nations quickly adapted ships to the task of minesweeping, including Australia&#x27;s 35 civilian ships that became auxiliary minesweepers. Both Allied and Axis countries made heavy use of minesweepers throughout the war. Historian Gordon Williamson wrote that &quot;Germany&#x27;s minesweepers alone formed a massive proportion of its total strength, and are very much the unsung heroes of the Kriegsmarine.&quot; Naval mines remained a threat even after the war ended, and minesweeping crews were still active after VJ Day.
After the Second World War, Allied countries worked on new classes of minesweepers ranging from 120-ton designs for clearing estuaries to 735-ton oceangoing vessels. The United States Navy even used specialized mechanized landing craft to sweep shallow harbors in and around North Korea.

, the U.S. Navy had four minesweepers deployed to the Persian Gulf to address regional instabilities. The Royal Navy also has four minesweepers stationed in the Persian Gulf as part of the 9th Mine Counter-Measures Squadron.

==Operation and requirements==

Minesweepers are equipped with mechanical or electrical devices, known as &quot;sweeps&quot;, for disabling mines. The modern minesweeper is designed to reduce the chances of it detonating mines itself; it is soundproofed to reduce its acoustic signature and often constructed using wood, fiberglass, or non-ferrous metal, or is degaussed to reduce its magnetic signature.

Mechanical sweeps are devices designed to cut the anchoring cables of moored mines, and preferably attach a tag to help the subsequent localization and neutralization. They are towed behind the minesweeper and use a towed body (e.g., oropesa, paravane) to maintain the sweep at the desired depth and position. Influence sweeps are equipment, often towed, that emulate a particular ship signature, thereby causing a mine to detonate. 

There are two modes of operating an influence sweep: MSM (mine setting mode) and TSM (target simulation mode or target setting mode). MSM sweeping is founded on intelligence on a given type of mine, and produces the output required for detonation of this mine. If such intelligence is unavailable, the TSM sweeping instead reproduces the influence of the friendly ship that is about to transit the area. TSM sweeping thus clears mines directed at this ship without knowledge of the mines. However, mines directed at other ships might remain.

The minesweeper differs from a minehunter; the minehunter actively detects and neutralizes individual mines. Minesweepers are in many cases complementary to minehunters, depending on the operation and the environment; a minesweeper is, in particular, better suited to clearing open-water areas with large numbers of mines. Both kinds of ships are collectively called mine countermeasure vessels (MCMV), a term also applied to a vessel that combines both roles.

<text>Shifting cultivation is an agricultural system in which plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned while post-disturbance fallow vegetation is allowed to freely grow while the cultivator moves on to another plot. The period of cultivation is usually terminated when the soil shows signs of exhaustion or, more commonly, when the field is overrun by weeds. The period of time during which the field is cultivated is usually shorter than the period over which the land is allowed to regenerate by lying fallow.

This technique is often used in LEDCs (Less Economically Developed Countries) or LICs (Low Income Countries). In some areas, cultivators use a practice of slash-and-burn as one element of their farming cycle. Others employ land clearing without any burning, and some cultivators are purely migratory and do not use any cyclical method on a given plot. Sometimes no slashing at all is needed where regrowth is purely of grasses, an outcome not uncommon when soils are near exhaustion and need to lie fallow.

In shifting agriculture, after two or three years of producing vegetable and grain crops on cleared land, the migrants abandon it for another plot. Land is often cleared by slash-and-burn methods—trees, bushes and forests are cleared by slashing, and the remaining vegetation is burnt. The ashes add potash to the soil. Then the seeds are sown after the rains.

==Political ecology==

Shifting cultivation is a form of agriculture or a cultivation system in which, at any particular point in time, a minority of &#x27;fields&#x27; are in cultivation and a majority are in various stages of natural re-growth. Over time, fields are cultivated for a relatively short time, and allowed to recover, or are fallowed, for a relatively long time. Eventually a previously cultivated field will be cleared of the natural vegetation and planted in crops again. Fields in established and stable shifting cultivation systems are cultivated and fallowed cyclically. This type of farming is called jhumming in India.

Fallow fields are not unproductive. During the fallow period, shifting cultivators use the successive vegetation species widely for timber for fencing and construction, firewood, thatching, ropes, clothing, tools, carrying devices and medicines. It is common for fruit and nut trees to be planted in fallow fields to the extent that parts of some fallows are in fact orchards. Soil-enhancing shrub or tree species may be planted or protected from slashing or burning in fallows. Many of these species have been shown to fix nitrogen. Fallows commonly contain plants that attract birds and animals and are important for hunting. But perhaps most importantly, tree fallows protect soil against physical erosion and draw nutrients to the surface from deep in the soil profile.

The relationship between the time the land is cultivated and the time it is fallowed are critical to the stability of shifting cultivation systems. These parameters determine whether or not the shifting cultivation system as a whole suffers a net loss of nutrients over time. A system in which there is a net loss of nutrients with each cycle will eventually lead to a degradation of resources unless actions are taken to arrest the losses. In some cases soil can be irreversibly exhausted (including erosion as well as nutrient loss) in less than a decade.

The longer a field is cropped, the greater the loss of soil organic matter, cation-exchange-capacity and in nitrogen and phosphorus, the greater the increase in acidity, the more likely soil porosity and infiltration capacity is reduced and the greater the loss of seeds of naturally occurring plant species from soil seed banks. In a stable shifting cultivation system, the fallow is long enough for the natural vegetation to recover to the state that it was in before it was cleared, and for the soil to recover to the condition it was in before cropping began. During fallow periods soil temperatures are lower, wind and water erosion is much reduced, nutrient cycling becomes closed again, nutrients are extracted from the subsoil, soil fauna decreases, acidity is reduced, soil structure, texture and moisture characteristics improve and seed banks are replenished.

The secondary forests created by shifting cultivation are commonly richer in plant and animal resources useful to humans than primary forests, even though they are much less bio-diverse. Shifting cultivators view the forest as an agricultural landscape of fields at various stages in a regular cycle. People unused to living in forests cannot see the fields for the trees. Rather they perceive an apparently chaotic landscape in which trees are cut and burned randomly and so they characterise shifting cultivation as ephemeral or &#x27;pre-agricultural&#x27;, as &#x27;primitive&#x27; and as a stage to be progressed beyond.

Shifting agriculture is none of these things. Stable shifting cultivation systems are highly variable, closely adapted to micro-environments and are carefully managed by farmers during both the cropping and fallow stages. Shifting cultivators may possess a highly developed knowledge and understanding of their local environments and of the crops and native plant species they exploit. Complex and highly adaptive land tenure systems sometimes exist under shifting cultivation. Introduced crops for food and as cash have been skillfully integrated into some shifting cultivation systems. Its disadvantages include the high initial cost, as manual labour is required.

==In Europe==

Shifting cultivation was still being practised as a viable and stable form of agriculture in many parts of Europe and east into Siberia at the end of the 19th century and in some places well into the 20th century. In the Ruhr in the late 1860s a forest-field rotation system known as was using a 16-year cycle of clearing, cropping and fallowing with trees to produce bark for tanneries, wood for charcoal and rye for flour (Darby 1956, 200). Swidden farming was practised in Siberia at least until the 1930s, using specially selected varieties of &quot;swidden-rye&quot; (Steensberg 1993, 98).

In Eastern Europe and Northern Russia the main swidden crops were turnips, barley, flax, rye, wheat, oats, radishes and millet. Cropping periods were usually one year, but were extended to two or three years on very favourable soils. Fallow periods were between 20 and 40 years (Linnard 1970, 195). In Finland in 1949, Steensberg (1993, 111) observed the clearing and burning of a swidden 440 km north of Helsinki.

Birch and pine trees had been cleared over a period of a year and the logs sold for cash. A fallow of alder (Alnus) was encouraged to improve soil conditions. After the burn, turnip was sown for sale and for cattle feed. Shifting cultivation was disappearing in this part of Finland because of a loss of agricultural labour to the industries of the towns. Steensberg (1993, 110–152) provides eye-witness descriptions of shifting cultivation being practised in Sweden in the 20th century, and in Estonia, Poland, the Caucasus, Serbia, Bosnia, Hungary, Switzerland, Austria and Germany in the 1930s to the 1950s.

That these agricultural practices survived from the Neolithic into the middle of the 20th century amidst the sweeping changes that occurred in Europe over that period, suggests they were adaptive and in themselves, were not massively destructive of the environments in which they were practiced.

The earliest written accounts of deforestation in Southern Europe begin around 1000 BC in the histories of Homer, Thucydides and Plato and in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. Forests were exploited for ship building, and urban development, the manufacture of casks, pitch and charcoal, as well as being cleared for agriculture. The intensification of trade and as a result of warfare, increased the demand for ships which were manufactured completely from forest products. Although goat herding is singled out as an important cause of environmental degradation, a more important cause of forest destruction was the practice in some places of granting ownership rights to those who clear felled forests and brought the land into permanent cultivation.

Evidence that circumstances other than agriculture were the major causes for forest destruction was the recovery of tree cover in many parts of the Roman empire from 400 BC to around 500 AD following the collapse of Roman economy and industry. Darby observes that by 400 AD &quot;land that had once been tilled became derelict and overgrown&quot; and quotes Lactantius who wrote that in many places &quot;cultivated land became forest&quot; (Darby 1956, 186). The other major cause of forest destruction in the Mediterranean environment with its hot dry summers were wild fires that became more common following human interference in the forests.

In Central and Northern Europe the use of stone tools and fire in agriculture is well established in the palynological and archaeological record from the Neolithic. Here, just as in Southern Europe, the demands of more intensive agriculture and the invention of the plough, trading, mining and smelting, tanning, building and construction in the growing towns and constant warfare, including the demands of naval shipbuilding, were more important forces behind the destruction of the forests than was shifting cultivation.

By the Middle Ages in Europe, large areas of forest were being cleared and converted into arable land in association with the development of feudal tenurial practices. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, the demands of iron smelters for charcoal, increasing industrial developments and the discovery and expansion of colonial empires as well as incessant warfare that increased the demand for shipping to levels never previously reached, all combined to deforest Europe.

With the loss of the forest, so shifting cultivation became restricted to the peripheral places of Europe, where permanent agriculture was uneconomic, transport costs constrained logging or terrain prevented the use of draught animals or tractors. It has disappeared from even these areas since 1945, as agriculture has become increasingly capital intensive, rural areas have become depopulated and the remnant European forests themselves have been revalued economically and socially.

Classical authors mentioned large forests, with Homer writing about &quot;wooded Samothrace&quot;, Zakynthos, Sicily, and other woodlands. These authors indicated that the Mediterranean area once had more forest; much had already been lost, and the remainder was primarily in the mountains.

Although parts of Europe remained wooded, by the late Iron Age and early Viking Ages, forests were drastically reduced and settlements regularly moved. The reasons for this pattern of mobility, the transition to stable settlements from the late Viking period on, or the transition from shifting cultivation to stationary farming are unknown. From this period, plows are found in graves. Early agricultural peoples preferred good forests on hillsides with good drainage, and traces of cattle enclosures are evident there.

In Italy, shifting cultivation was no longer used by the common era. Tacitus describes it as a strange cultivation method, practiced by the Germans. In 98 CE, he wrote about the Germans that their fields were proportional to the participating cultivators but their crops were shared according to status. Distribution was simple, because of wide availability; they changed fields annually, with much to spare because they were producing grain rather than other crops. A W Liljenstrand wrote in his 1857 doctoral dissertation, &quot;About Changing of Soil&quot; (pp. 5 ff.), that Tacitus discusses shifting cultivation: &quot;arva per annos mutant&quot;. This is the practice of shifting cultivation.

During the Migration Period in Europe, after the Roman Empire and before the Viking Age, the peoples of Central Europe moved to new forests after exhausting old parcels. Forests were quickly exhausted; the practice had ended in the Mediterranean, where forests were less resilient than the sturdier coniferous forests of Central Europe. Deforestation had been partially caused by burning to create pasture. Reduced timber delivery led to higher prices and more stone construction in the Roman Empire (Stewart 1956, p. 123). Although forests gradually decreased in northern Europe, they have survived in the Nordic countries.

Many Italic peoples saw benefits in allying with Rome. When the Romans built the &quot;Via Amerina&quot; in 241 BCE, the Falisci settled in cities on the plains and aided the Romans in road construction; the Roman Senate gradually acquired representatives from Faliscan and Etruscan families, and the Italic tribes became settled farmers.

Classical writers described peoples who practiced shifting cultivation, which characterized the Migration Period in Europe. The exploitation of forests demanded displacement as areas were deforested. Julius Caesar wrote about the Suebi in &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; 4.1, &quot;They have no private and secluded fields (&quot;privati ac separati agri apud eos nihil est&quot;) ... They cannot stay more than one year in a place for cultivation’s sake&quot; (&quot;neque longius anno remanere uno in loco colendi causa licet&quot;).

The Suebi lived between the Rhine and the Elbe. About the Germani, Caesar wrote: &quot;No one has a particular field or area for himself, for the magistrates and chiefs give year by year to the people and the clans, who have gathered together, as much land and in such places as seem good to them and then make them move on after a year&quot; (&quot;Neque quisquam agri modum certum aut fines habet proprios, sed magistratus ac principes in annos singulos gentibus cognationibusque hominum, qui tum una coierunt, a quantum et quo loco visum est agri attribuunt atque anno post alio transire cogunt&quot; [Book 6.22]).

Strabo (63 BCE—c. 20 CE) also writes about the Suebi in his &quot;Geography&quot; (VII, 1, 3): &quot;Common to all the people in this area is that they can easily change residence because of their sordid way of life; they do not cultivate fields or collect property, but live in temporary huts. They get their nourishment from their livestock for the most part, and like nomads, pack all their goods in wagons and go on to wherever they want&quot;. Horace writes in 17 BCE (&quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot;, 3, 24, 9ff.) about the people of Macedonia: &quot;The proud Getae also live happily, growing free food and cereal for themselves on land they do not want to cultivate for more than a year&quot; (&quot;Vivunt et rigidi Getae, / immetata quibus iugera liberas / fruges et Cererem ferunt, / nec cultura placet longior annua&quot;).

==Simple societies and environmental change==

A growing body of palynological evidence finds that simple human societies brought about extensive changes to their environments before the establishment of any sort of state, feudal or capitalist, and before the development of large scale mining, smelting or shipbuilding industries. In these societies agriculture was the driving force in the economy and shifting cultivation was the most common type of agriculture practiced. By examining the relationships between social and economic change and agricultural change in these societies, insights can be gained on contemporary social and economic change and global environment change, and the place of shifting cultivation in those relationships.

As early as 1930 questions about relationships between the rise and fall of the Mayan civilization of the Yucatán Peninsula and shifting cultivation were raised and continue to be debated today. Archaeological evidence suggests the development of Mayan society and economy began around 250 AD. A mere 700 years later it reached its apogee, by which time the population may have reached 2,000,000 people. There followed a precipitous decline that left the great cities and ceremonial centres vacant and overgrown with jungle vegetation. The causes of this decline are uncertain; but warfare and the exhaustion of agricultural land are commonly cited (Meggers 1954; Dumond 1961; Turner 1974). More recent work suggests the Maya may have, in suitable places, developed irrigation systems and more intensive agricultural practices (Humphries 1993).

Similar paths appear to have been followed by Polynesian settlers in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, who within 500 years of their arrival around 1100 AD turned substantial areas from forest into scrub and fern and in the process caused the elimination of numerous species of birds and animals (Kirch and Hunt 1997). In the restricted environments of the Pacific islands, including Fiji and Hawaii, early extensive erosion and change of vegetation is presumed to have been caused by shifting cultivation on slopes. Soils washed from slopes were deposited in valley bottoms as a rich, swampy alluvium.

These new environments were then exploited to develop intensive, irrigated fields. The change from shifting cultivation to intensive irrigated fields occurred in association with a rapid growth in population and the development of elaborate and highly stratified chiefdoms (Kirch 1984). In the larger, temperate latitude, islands of New Zealand the presumed course of events took a different path. There the stimulus for population growth was the hunting of large birds to extinction, during which time forests in drier areas were destroyed by burning, followed the development of intensive agriculture in favorable environments, based mainly on sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and a reliance on the gathering of two main wild plant species in less favorable environments. These changes, as in the smaller islands, were accompanied by population growth, the competition for the occupation of the best environments, complexity in social organization, and endemic warfare (Anderson 1997).

The record of humanly induced changes in environments is longer in New Guinea than in most places. Agricultural activities probably began 5,000 to 9,000 years ago. However, the most spectacular changes, in both societies and environments, are believed to have occurred in the central highlands of the island within the last 1,000 years, in association with the introduction of a crop new to New Guinea, the sweet potato (Golson 1982a; 1982b). One of the most striking signals of the relatively recent intensification of agriculture is the sudden increase in sedimentation rates in small lakes.

The root question posed by these and the numerous other examples that could be cited of simple societies that have intensified their agricultural systems in association with increases in population and social complexity is not whether or how shifting cultivation was responsible for the extensive changes to landscapes and environments. Rather it is why simple societies of shifting cultivators in the tropical forest of Yucatán, or the highlands of New Guinea, began to grow in numbers and to develop stratified and sometimes complex social hierarchies?

At first sight, the greatest stimulus to the intensification of a shifting cultivation system is a growth in population. If no other changes occur within the system, for each extra person to be fed from the system, a small extra amount of land must be cultivated. The total amount of land available is the land being presently cropped and all of the land in fallow. If the area occupied by the system is not expanded into previously unused land, then either the cropping period must be extended or the fallow period shortened.

At least two problems exist with the population growth hypothesis. First, population growth in most pre-industrial shifting cultivator societies has been shown to be very low over the long term. Second, no human societies are known where people work only to eat. People engage in social relations with each other and agricultural produce is used in the conduct of these relationships.

These relationships are the focus of two attempts to understand the nexus between human societies and their environments, one an explanation of a particular situation and the other a general exploration of the problem.

=== Feedback loops===
In a study of the Duna in the Southern Highlands of New Guinea, a group in the process of moving from shifting cultivation into permanent field agriculture post sweet potato, Modjeska (1982) argued for the development of two &quot;self amplifying feed back loops&quot; of ecological and social causation. The trigger to the changes were very slow population growth and the slow expansion of agriculture to meet the demands of this growth. This set in motion the first feedback loop, the &quot;use-value&quot; loop.

As more forest was cleared there was a decline in wild food resources and protein produced from hunting, which was substituted for by an increase in domestic pig raising. An increase in domestic pigs required a further expansion in agriculture. The greater protein available from the larger number of pigs increased human fertility and survival rates and resulted in faster population growth.

The outcome of the operation of the two loops, one bringing about ecological change and the other social and economic change, is an expanding and intensifying agricultural system, the conversion of forest to grassland, a population growing at an increasing rate and expanding geographically and a society that is increasing in complexity and stratification.

=== Resources are cultural appraisals===
The second attempt to explain the relationships between simple agricultural societies and their environments is that of Ellen (1982, 252–270). Ellen does not attempt to separate use-values from social production. He argues that almost all of the materials required by humans to live (with perhaps the exception of air) are obtained through social relations of production and that these relations proliferate and are modified in numerous ways. The values that humans attribute to items produced from the environment arise out of cultural arrangements and not from the objects themselves, a restatement of Carl Sauer&#x27;s dictum that &quot;resources are cultural appraisals&quot;.

Humans frequently translate actual objects into culturally conceived forms, an example being the translation by the Duna of the pig into an item of compensation and redemption. As a result, two fundamental processes underlie the ecology of human social systems: First, the obtaining of materials from the environment and their alteration and circulation through social relations, and second, giving the material a value which will affect how important it is to obtain it, circulate it or alter it. Environmental pressures are thus mediated through social relations.

Transitions in ecological systems and in social systems do not proceed at the same rate. The rate of phylogenetic change is determined mainly by natural selection and partly by human interference and adaptation, such as for example, the domestication of a wild species. Humans however have the ability to learn and to communicate their knowledge to each other and across generations. If most social systems have the tendency to increase in complexity they will, sooner or later, come into conflict with, or into &quot;contradiction&quot; (Friedman 1979, 1982) with their environments. What happens around the point of &quot;contradiction&quot; will determine the extent of the environmental degradation that will occur. Of particular importance is the ability of the society to change, to invent or to innovate technologically and sociologically, in order to overcome the &quot;contradiction&quot; without incurring continuing environmental degradation, or social disintegration.

An economic study of what occurs at the points of conflict with specific reference to shifting cultivation is that of Esther Boserup (1965). Boserup argues that low intensity farming, extensive shifting cultivation for example, has lower labor costs than more intensive farming systems. This assertion remains controversial. She also argues that given a choice, a human group will always choose the technique which has the lowest absolute labor cost rather than the highest yield. But at the point of conflict, yields will have become unsatisfactory.

Boserup argues, contra Malthus, that rather than population always overwhelming resources, that humans will invent a new agricultural technique or adopt an existing innovation that will boost yields and that is adapted to the new environmental conditions created by the degradation which has occurred already, even though they will pay for the increases in higher labor costs. Examples of such changes are the adoption of new higher yielding crops, the exchanging of a digging stick for a hoe, or a hoe for a plough, or the development of irrigation systems. The controversy over Boserup&#x27;s proposal is in part over whether intensive systems are more costly in labor terms, and whether humans will bring about change in their agricultural systems before environmental degradation forces them to.

==In the contemporary world and global environmental change==

The estimated rate of deforestation in Southeast Asia in 1990 was 34,000 km2 per year (FAO 1990, quoted in Potter 1993). In Indonesia alone it was estimated 13,100 km2 per year were being lost, 3,680 km2 per year from Sumatra and 3,770 km2 from Kalimantan, of which 1,440 km2 were due to the fires of 1982 to 1983. Since those estimates were made huge fires have ravaged Indonesian forests during the 1997 to 1998 El Niño associated drought.

Shifting cultivation was assessed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to be one of the causes of deforestation while logging was not. The apparent discrimination against shifting cultivators caused a confrontation between FAO and environmental groups, who saw the FAO supporting commercial logging interests against the rights of indigenous people (Potter 1993, 108). Other independent studies of the problem note that despite lack of government control over forests and the dominance of a political elite in the logging industry, the causes of deforestation are more complex.

The loggers have provided paid employment to former subsistence farmers. One of the outcomes of cash incomes has been rapid population growth among indigenous groups of former shifting cultivators that has placed pressure on their traditional long fallow farming systems. Many farmers have taken advantage of the improved road access to urban areas by planting cash crops, such as rubber or pepper as noted above. Increased cash incomes often are spent on chain saws, which have enabled larger areas to be cleared for cultivation.

Fallow periods have been reduced and cropping periods extended. Serious poverty elsewhere in the country has brought thousands of land-hungry settlers into the cut-over forests along the logging roads. The settlers practice what appears to be shifting cultivation but which is in fact a one-cycle slash and burn followed by continuous cropping, with no intention to long fallow. Clearing of trees and the permanent cultivation of fragile soils in a tropical environment with little attempt to replace lost nutrients may cause rapid degradation of the fragile soils.

The loss of forest in Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines during the 1990s was preceded by major ecosystem disruptions in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in the 1970s and 1980s caused by warfare. Forests were sprayed with defoliants, thousands of rural forest dwelling people were uprooted from their homes and driven into previously isolated areas. The loss of the tropical forests of Southeast Asia is the particular outcome of the general possible outcomes described by Ellen (see above) when small local ecological and social systems become part of a larger system.

When the previous relatively stable ecological relationships are destabilized, degradation can occur rapidly. Similar descriptions of the loss of forest and destruction of fragile ecosystems could be provided from the Amazon Basin, by large scale state sponsored colonization forest land (Becker 1995, 61) or from the Central Africa where what endemic armed conflict is destabilizing rural settlement and farming communities on a massive scale.

==Comparison with other ecological phenomena==

In the tropical developing world, shifting cultivation in its many diverse forms, remains a pervasive practice. Shifting cultivation was one of the first forms of agriculture practiced by humans and its survival into the modern world suggests that it is a flexible and highly adaptive means of production. However, it is also a grossly misunderstood practice. Many casual observers cannot see past the clearing and burning of standing forest and do not perceive often ecologically stable cycles of cropping and fallowing. Nevertheless, shifting cultivation systems are particularly susceptible to rapid increases in population and to economic and social change in the larger world around them.

The blame for the destruction of forest resources is often laid on shifting cultivators. But the forces bringing about the rapid loss of tropical forests at the end of the 20th century are the same forces that led to the destruction of the forests of Europe, urbanization, industrialization, increased affluence, populational growth and geographical expansion and the application the latest technology to extract ever more resources from the environment in pursuit of wealth and political power by competing groups. However we must know that those who practice Agriculture are at the receiving end of the social stratum.

==Alternative practice in the pre-Columbian Amazon basin==

Slash-and-char, as opposed to slash-and-burn, may create self-perpetuating soil fertility that supports sedentary agriculture, but the society so sustained may still be overturned, as above (&quot;see&quot; article at Terra preta).

<text>In linear algebra, an invertible matrix is a square matrix that has an inverse. In other words, if some other matrix is multiplied by the invertible matrix, the result can be multiplied by an inverse to undo the operation. An invertible matrix multiplied by its inverse yields the identity matrix. Invertible matrices are the same size as their inverse.

== Definition ==
An -by- square matrix is called invertible (also nonsingular, nondegenerate or rarely regular) if there exists an -by- square matrix such thatformula_1where denotes the -by- identity matrix and the multiplication used is ordinary matrix multiplication. If this is the case, then the matrix is uniquely determined by , and is called the (multiplicative) inverse of , denoted by . Matrix inversion is the process of finding the matrix which when multiplied by the original matrix gives the identity matrix.

Over a field, a square matrix that is &quot;not&quot; invertible is called singular or degenerate. A square matrix with entries in a field is singular if and only if its determinant is zero. Singular matrices are rare in the sense that if a square matrix&#x27;s entries are randomly selected from any bounded region on the number line or complex plane, the probability that the matrix is singular is 0, that is, it will &quot;almost never&quot; be singular. Non-square matrices, i.e. -by- matrices for which , do not have an inverse. However, in some cases such a matrix may have a left inverse or right inverse. If is -by- and the rank of is equal to , (), then has a left inverse, an -by- matrix such that . If has rank (), then it has a right inverse, an -by- matrix such that .

While the most common case is that of matrices over the real or complex numbers, all of those definitions can be given for matrices over any algebraic structure equipped with addition and multiplication (i.e. rings). However, in the case of a ring being commutative, the condition for a square matrix to be invertible is that its determinant is invertible in the ring, which in general is a stricter requirement than it being nonzero. For a noncommutative ring, the usual determinant is not defined. The conditions for existence of left-inverse or right-inverse are more complicated, since a notion of rank does not exist over rings.

The set of invertible matrices together with the operation of matrix multiplication and entries from ring form a group, the general linear group of degree , denoted .

== Properties ==
=== Invertible matrix theorem ===
Let be a square -by- matrix over a field (e.g., the field of real numbers). The following statements are equivalent, i.e., they are either all true or all false for any given matrix:
* is invertible, i.e. it has an inverse under matrix multiplication, i.e., there exists a such that . (In that statement, &quot;invertible&quot; can equivalently be replaced with &quot;left-invertible&quot; or &quot;right-invertible&quot; in which one-sided inverses are considered.)
* The linear transformation mapping to is invertible, i.e., it has an inverse under function composition. (There, again, &quot;invertible&quot; can equivalently be replaced with either &quot;left-invertible&quot; or &quot;right-invertible&quot;.)
* The transpose is an invertible matrix.
* is row-equivalent to the -by- identity matrix .
* is column-equivalent to the -by- identity matrix .
* has pivot positions.
* has full rank: .
* has a trivial kernel: 
* The linear transformation mapping to is bijective; that is, the equation has exactly one solution for each in . (There, &quot;bijective&quot; can equivalently be replaced with &quot;injective&quot; or &quot;surjective&quot;.)
* The columns of form a basis of . (In this statement, &quot;basis&quot; can equivalently be replaced with either &quot;linearly independent set&quot; or &quot;spanning set&quot;)
* The rows of form a basis of . (Similarly, here, &quot;basis&quot; can equivalently be replaced with either &quot;linearly independent set&quot; or &quot;spanning set&quot;)
* The determinant of is nonzero: . (In general, a square matrix over a commutative ring is invertible if and only if its determinant is a unit (i.e. multiplicatively invertible element) of that ring.
* The number 0 is not an eigenvalue of . (More generally, a number formula_2 is an eigenvalue of if the matrix formula_3 is singular, where is the identity matrix.)
* The matrix can be expressed as a finite product of elementary matrices.

=== Other properties ===
Furthermore, the following properties hold for an invertible matrix :

* formula_4
* formula_5 for nonzero scalar

The rows of the inverse matrix of a matrix are orthonormal to the columns of (and vice versa interchanging rows for columns). To see this, suppose that where the rows of are denoted as formula_12 and the columns of as formula_13 for formula_14 Then clearly, the Euclidean inner product of any two formula_15 This property can also be useful in constructing the inverse of a square matrix in some instances, where a set of orthogonal vectors (but not necessarily orthonormal vectors) to the columns of are known. In which case, one can apply the iterative Gram–Schmidt process to this initial set to determine the rows of the inverse . 

A matrix that is its own inverse (i.e., a matrix such that and consequently ) is called an involutory matrix.

=== In relation to its adjugate ===
The adjugate of a matrix can be used to find the inverse of as follows:

If is an invertible matrix, then
: formula_16

=== In relation to the identity matrix ===
It follows from the associativity of matrix multiplication that if
: formula_17

for &quot;finite square&quot; matrices and , then also

: formula_18

=== Density ===
Over the field of real numbers, the set of singular -by- matrices, considered as a subset of is a null set, that is, has Lebesgue measure zero. That is true because singular matrices are the roots of the determinant function. It is a continuous function because it is a polynomial in the entries of the matrix. Thus in the language of measure theory, almost all -by- matrices are invertible.

Furthermore, the set of -by- invertible matrices is open and dense in the topological space of all -by- matrices. Equivalently, the set of singular matrices is closed and nowhere dense in the space of -by- matrices.

In practice, however, non-invertible matrices may be encountered. In numerical calculations, matrices that are invertible but close to a non-invertible matrix may still be problematic and are said to be ill-conditioned.

== Examples ==
This example with rank of is a non-invertible matrix:
: formula_19
We can see the rank of this 2-by-2 matrix is 1, which is , so it is non-invertible.

Consider the following 2-by-2 matrix:
: formula_20
The matrix formula_21 is invertible. To check this, one can compute that formula_22, which is non-zero. 

As an example of a non-invertible, or singular, matrix, consider:
: formula_23
The determinant of formula_24 is 0, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix to be non-invertible.

== Methods of matrix inversion ==
=== Gaussian elimination ===
Gaussian elimination is a useful and easy way to compute the inverse of a matrix. To compute a matrix inverse using this method, an augmented matrix is first created with the left side being the matrix to invert and the right side being the identity matrix. Then, Gaussian elimination is used to convert the left side into the identity matrix, which causes the right side to become the inverse of the input matrix.

For example, take the following matrix: formula_25 

The first step to compute its inverse is to create the augmented matrix formula_26 

Call the first row of this matrix formula_27 and the second row formula_28. Then, add row 1 to row 2 formula_29 This yields formula_30 

Next, subtract row 2, multiplied by 3, from row 1 formula_31 which yields formula_32

Finally, multiply row 1 by −1 formula_33 and row 2 by 2 formula_34 This yields the identity matrix on the left side and the inverse matrix on the right:formula_35 

Thus, formula_36
It works because the process of Gaussian elimination can be viewed as a sequence of applying left matrix multiplication using elementary row operations using elementary matrices (formula_37), such as formula_38

Applying right-multiplication using formula_39 we get formula_40 And the right side formula_41 which is the inverse we want. 

To obtain formula_42 we create the augumented matrix by combining with and applying Gaussian elimination. The two portions will be transformed using the same sequence of elementary row operations. When the left portion becomes , the right portion applied the same elementary row operation sequence will become .

=== Newton&#x27;s method ===
A generalization of Newton&#x27;s method as used for a multiplicative inverse algorithm may be convenient if it is convenient to find a suitable starting seed:
: formula_43

Victor Pan and John Reif have done work that includes ways of generating a starting seed.

Newton&#x27;s method is particularly useful when dealing with families of related matrices that behave enough like the sequence manufactured for the homotopy above: sometimes a good starting point for refining an approximation for the new inverse can be the already obtained inverse of a previous matrix that nearly matches the current matrix. For example, the pair of sequences of inverse matrices used in obtaining matrix square roots by Denman–Beavers iteration. That may need more than one pass of the iteration at each new matrix, if they are not close enough together for just one to be enough. Newton&#x27;s method is also useful for &quot;touch up&quot; corrections to the Gauss–Jordan algorithm which has been contaminated by small errors from imperfect computer arithmetic.

=== Cayley–Hamilton method ===
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem allows the inverse of to be expressed in terms of , traces and powers of :
: formula_44

where is size of , and is the trace of matrix given by the sum of the main diagonal. The sum is taken over and the sets of all formula_45 satisfying the linear Diophantine equation 
: formula_46

The formula can be rewritten in terms of complete Bell polynomials of arguments formula_47 as
: formula_48
That is described in more detail under Cayley–Hamilton method.

=== Eigendecomposition ===

If matrix can be eigendecomposed, and if none of its eigenvalues are zero, then is invertible and its inverse is given by
: formula_49

where is the square matrix whose th column is the eigenvector formula_50 of , and is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the corresponding eigenvalues, that is, formula_51 If
 is symmetric, is guaranteed to be an orthogonal matrix, therefore formula_52 Furthermore, because is a diagonal matrix, its inverse is easy to calculate:
: formula_53

=== Cholesky decomposition ===

If matrix is positive definite, then its inverse can be obtained as
: formula_54

where is the lower triangular Cholesky decomposition of , and denotes the conjugate transpose of .

=== Analytic solution ===

Writing the transpose of the matrix of cofactors, known as an adjugate matrix, may also be an efficient way to calculate the inverse of &quot;small&quot; matrices, but the recursive method is inefficient for large matrices. To determine the inverse, we calculate a matrix of cofactors:
: formula_55
so that
: formula_56
where is the determinant of , is the matrix of cofactors, and represents the matrix transpose.

==== Inversion of 2 × 2 matrices ====
The &quot;cofactor equation&quot; listed above yields the following result for matrices. Inversion of these matrices can be done as follows:
: formula_57

This is possible because is the reciprocal of the determinant of the matrix in question, and the same strategy could be used for other matrix sizes.

The Cayley–Hamilton method gives
: formula_58

==== Inversion of 3 × 3 matrices ====
A computationally efficient matrix inversion is given by
: formula_59
(where the scalar is not to be confused with the matrix ).

If the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is invertible, with the entries of the intermediary matrix on the right side above given by
: formula_60

The determinant of can be computed by applying the rule of Sarrus as follows:
: formula_61

The Cayley–Hamilton decomposition gives
: formula_62
The general inverse can be expressed concisely in terms of the cross product and triple product. If a matrix formula_63 (consisting of three column vectors, formula_64, formula_65, and formula_66) is invertible, its inverse is given by 
: formula_67

The determinant of , , is equal to the triple product of , , and —the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the rows or columns: 
: formula_68

The correctness of the formula can be checked by using cross- and triple-product properties and by noting that for groups, left and right inverses always coincide. Intuitively, because of the cross products, each row of is orthogonal to the non-corresponding two columns of (causing the off-diagonal terms of formula_69 be zero). Dividing by 
: formula_70
causes the diagonal entries of to be unity. For example, the first diagonal is:
: formula_71

==== Inversion of 4 × 4 matrices ====
With increasing dimension, expressions for the inverse of get complicated. For , the Cayley–Hamilton method leads to an expression that is still tractable:
:formula_72

=== Blockwise inversion ===
Matrices can also be &quot;inverted blockwise&quot; by using the analytic inversion formula:

where , , and are matrix sub-blocks of arbitrary size. ( must be square, so that it can be inverted. Furthermore, and must be nonsingular.) The strategy is particularly advantageous if is diagonal and (the Schur complement of ) is a small matrix, since they are the only matrices requiring inversion.

This technique was reinvented several times by Hans Boltz (1923), who used it for the inversion of geodetic matrices, and Tadeusz Banachiewicz (1937), who generalized it and proved its correctness.

The nullity theorem says that the nullity of equals the nullity of the sub-block in the lower right of the inverse matrix, and that the nullity of equals the nullity of the sub-block in the upper right of the inverse matrix.

The inversion procedure that led to Equation () performed matrix block operations that operated on and first. Instead, if and are operated on first, and provided and are nonsingular, the result is
Equating Equations () and () leads to
where Equation () is the Woodbury matrix identity, which is equivalent to the binomial inverse theorem.

If and are both invertible, then the above two block matrix inverses can be combined to provide the simple factorization
By the Weinstein–Aronszajn identity, one of the two matrices in the block-diagonal matrix is invertible exactly when the other is.

This formula simplifies significantly when the upper right block matrix is the zero matrix. This formulation is useful when the matrices and have relatively simple inverse formulas (or pseudo inverses in the case where the blocks are not all square. In this special case, the block matrix inversion formula stated in full generality above becomes 

:formula_73

If the given invertible matrix is a symmetric matrix with invertible block the following block inverse formula holds

where formula_74. This requires 2 inversions of the half-sized matrices and and only 4 multiplications of half-sized matrices, if organized properly
formula_75 together with some additions, subtractions, negations and transpositions of negligible complexity. Any matrix formula_76 has an associated positive semidefinite, symmetric matrix formula_77, which is exactly invertible (and positive definite), if and only if formula_76 is invertible. By writing formula_79 matrix inversion can be reduced to inverting symmetric matrices and 2 additional matrix multiplications, because the positive definite matrix formula_77 satisfies the invertibility condition for its left upper block .

Those formulas together allow to construct a divide and conquer algorithm that uses blockwise inversion of associated symmetric matrices to invert a matrix with the same time complexity as the matrix multiplication algorithm that is used internally. Research into matrix multiplication complexity shows that there exist matrix multiplication algorithms with a complexity of operations, while the best proven lower bound is .

=== By Neumann series ===
If a matrix has the property that
: formula_81

then is nonsingular and its inverse may be expressed by a Neumann series:

: formula_82

Truncating the sum results in an &quot;approximate&quot; inverse which may be useful as a preconditioner. Note that a truncated series can be accelerated exponentially by noting that the Neumann series is a geometric sum. As such, it satisfies 
: formula_83.

Therefore, only matrix multiplications are needed to compute terms of the sum.

More generally, if is &quot;near&quot; the invertible matrix in the sense that
: formula_84

then is nonsingular and its inverse is
: formula_85

If it is also the case that has rank 1 then this simplifies to
: formula_86

=== &quot;p&quot;-adic approximation ===
If is a matrix with integer or rational entries, and we seek a solution in arbitrary-precision rationals, a -adic approximation method converges to an exact solution in , assuming standard matrix multiplication is used. The method relies on solving linear systems via Dixon&#x27;s method of -adic approximation (each in ) and is available as such in software specialized in arbitrary-precision matrix operations, for example, in IML.

=== Reciprocal basis vectors method ===

Given an square matrix formula_87, formula_88, with rows interpreted as vectors formula_89 (Einstein summation assumed) where the formula_90 are a standard orthonormal basis of Euclidean space formula_91 (formula_92), then using Clifford algebra (or geometric algebra) we compute the reciprocal (sometimes called dual) column vectors:
:formula_93 
as the columns of the inverse matrix formula_94 Note that, the place &quot;formula_95&quot; indicates that &quot;formula_96&quot; is removed from that place in the above expression for formula_97. We then have formula_98, where formula_99 is the Kronecker delta. We also have formula_100, as required. If the vectors formula_96 are not linearly independent, then formula_102 and the matrix formula_103 is not invertible (has no inverse).

== Derivative of the matrix inverse ==
Suppose that the invertible matrix A depends on a parameter &quot;t&quot;. Then the derivative of the inverse of A with respect to &quot;t&quot; is given by
: formula_104

To derive the above expression for the derivative of the inverse of A, one can differentiate the definition of the matrix inverse formula_105 and then solve for the inverse of A:
: formula_106

Subtracting formula_107 from both sides of the above and multiplying on the right by formula_108 gives the correct expression for the derivative of the inverse:
: formula_104

Similarly, if formula_110 is a small number then
: formula_111

More generally, if

: formula_112

then,

: formula_113

Given a positive integer formula_114,

: formula_115

Therefore,

: formula_116

== Generalized inverses ==
Some of the properties of inverse matrices are shared by generalized inverses (such as the Moore–Penrose inverse), which can be defined for any &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix.

== Applications ==
For most practical applications, it is not necessary to invert a matrix to solve a system of linear equations; however, for a unique solution, it is necessary for the matrix involved to be invertible.

Decomposition techniques like LU decomposition are much faster than inversion, and various fast algorithms for special classes of linear systems have also been developed.

=== Regression/least squares ===
Although an explicit inverse is not necessary to estimate the vector of unknowns, it is the easiest way to estimate their accuracy and os found in the diagonal of a matrix inverse (the posterior covariance matrix of the vector of unknowns). However, faster algorithms to compute only the diagonal entries of a matrix inverse are known in many cases.

=== Matrix inverses in real-time simulations ===
Matrix inversion plays a significant role in computer graphics, particularly in 3D graphics rendering and 3D simulations. Examples include screen-to-world ray casting, world-to-subspace-to-world object transformations, and physical simulations.

=== Matrix inverses in MIMO wireless communication ===
Matrix inversion also plays a significant role in the MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output) technology in wireless communications. The MIMO system consists of &quot;N&quot; transmit and &quot;M&quot; receive antennas. Unique signals, occupying the same frequency band, are sent via &quot;N&quot; transmit antennas and are received via &quot;M&quot; receive antennas. The signal arriving at each receive antenna will be a linear combination of the &quot;N&quot; transmitted signals forming an &quot;N&quot; × &quot;M&quot; transmission matrix H. It is crucial for the matrix H to be invertible so that the receiver can figure out the transmitted information.

<text>Osroene or Osrhoene (; ) was an ancient region and state in Upper Mesopotamia. The &quot;Kingdom of Osroene&quot;, also known as the &quot;Kingdom of Edessa&quot; ( / &quot;Kingdom of Urhay&quot;), according to the name of its capital city (now Şanlıurfa, Turkey), existed from the 2nd century BC, up to the 3rd century AD, and was ruled by the Abgarid dynasty. Generally allied with the Parthians, the Kingdom of Osroene enjoyed semi-autonomy to complete independence from the years of 132 BC to AD 214. The kingdom&#x27;s population was of mixed culture, being Syriac-speaking from the earliest times. The city&#x27;s cultural setting was fundamentally Syriac, alongside strong Greek and Parthian influences, though some Arab cults were also attested at Edessa.

The ruling Abgarid dynasty was deposed by the Romans during the reign of Roman Emperor Caracalla (211–217), probably in 214 or 216, and Osroene was incorporated as a province, but it was briefly reestablished during the reign of Roman emperor Gordianus III (238–244). Christianity came early to Osroene. From 318, Osroene was a part of the Diocese of the East. By the 5th century, Edessa had become a main center of Syriac literature and learning. In 608, the Sasanian emperor, Khosrow II (590–628), took Osroene. It was briefly reconquered by the Byzantines, but in 638 it fell to the Arabs as part of the Muslim conquests.

==Background and context==


Osroene, or Edessa, was one of several states that acquired independence from the collapsing Seleucid Empire through a dynasty of the nomadic Nabataean Arab tribe from Southern Canaan and North Arabia, the Osrhoeni, from 136 BC. Osroene&#x27;s name either derives from the name of this tribe, or from &quot;Orhay&quot; (&quot;Urhay&quot;), the original Aramaic name of Edessa. Arab influence had been strong in the region.

Osroene endured for four centuries, with twenty-eight rulers occasionally named &quot;king&quot; on their coins. Most of the kings of Osroene were called &quot;Abgar&quot; or &quot;Manu&quot; and settled in urban centers.

Osroene was generally allied with the Parthian Empire. After a period under the rule of the Parthian Empire, it was absorbed into the Roman Empire in 114 as a semiautonomous vassal state, and incorporated as a simple Roman province in 214. There is an apocryphal legend that Osroene was the first state to have accepted Christianity as state religion, but there is not enough evidence to support that claim.

==Population and culture==
Though most of Osroene&#x27;s rulers were from the Abgarid dynasty of Arab origin, the kingdom&#x27;s population was of mixed culture, being Syriac-speaking from the earliest times. Though Arab cults were attested at Edessa (the twins Monimos and Azizos), its cultural setting was fundamentally Syriac, alongside strong Greek and Parthian influences. Thus, according to Maurice Sartre: &quot;It would hence be absurd to regard Edessa as solely an Arab city, for its culture owed very little to the nomadic Arabs of the region&quot;. Later, within the Roman Empire, Edessa was the most important center of Syriac Christianity. Under the Nabataean dynasties, Osroëne became increasingly influenced by Syriac Christianity, and was a centre of local reaction against Hellenism.

In his writings, Pliny the Elder refers to the natives of Osroene and Commagene as Arabs and the region as Arabia. Abgar II is called &quot;an Arab phylarch&quot; by Plutarch, while Abgar V is described as &quot;king of the Arabs&quot; by Tacitus.

The Edessene onomastic contains many Arabic names. The most common one in the ruling dynasty of Edessa being Abgar, a well-attested name among Arabic groups of antiquity. Some members of the dynasty bore Iranian names, while others had Arabic names. Judah Segal notes that the names ending in &quot;-u&quot; are &quot;undoubtedly Nabatean&quot;. The Abgarid dynasts spoke &quot;a form of Aramaic&quot;.

It was in the region in which the legend of Abgar V originated.

==In Roman sources==
The area of the kingdom was perhaps roughly coterminous with that of the Roman province of Osrhoene. The great loop of the Euphrates was a natural frontier to the north and west. In the south Batnae was capital of the semi-autonomous principality of Anthemusias until its annexation by Rome, in AD 115. The eastern boundary is uncertain; it may have extended to Nisibis or even to Adiabene in the first century AD. Ḥarrān, however, only 40 km south of Edessa, always maintained its independent status as a Roman colonia.

Edessa, the capital of the ancient kingdom, was a fortress of considerable strength and a staging post both large and nearest to the Euphrates. It was an important road junction; an ancient highway, along which caravans carried merchandise from China and India to the West, meeting there a north–south road connecting the Armenian Highlands with Antioch. Inevitably, Edessa figured prominently on the international stage.

In 64 BC, as Pompey waged war on the Parthian Empire, Abgar II of Osrhoene had sided with the Romans when Lucius Afranius occupied Upper Mesopotamia. The king was initially an ally of the Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus in his campaign against the Parthians in 53 BC, but Roman historians allege that he betrayed Crassus by leading him to deviate from his safe route along the river and instead into an open desert, where the troops suffered from the barrenness and thus were vulnerable to cavalry attack. Abgar is said to have met with Surenas, the Parthian general, and informed him of the Roman movements. The enormous and infamous Battle of Carrhae followed and destroyed the entire Roman army. Just prior to the battle, Abgar made a pretext to ride away. However, modern historians have questioned whether Abgar intended to betray the Romans and instead may have simply been leading them along an old Arab trade route. According to a Syriac source, Abgar died later that year.

In the early 2nd century AD, King Abgar VII joined the Emperor Trajan&#x27;s campaign into Mesopotamia and entertained him at court. The king later rebelled against the Romans, however, which led to the Roman general Lucius Quietus sacking Edessa and putting an end to Osrhoene&#x27;s independence in 116. In 123, during the reign of Hadrian, the Abgarid dynasty was restored with the installation of Ma&#x27;nu VII, and Osroene was established as a client kingdom of the Empire. After the Roman–Parthian War of 161–166 under Marcus Aurelius, forts were built and a Roman garrison was stationed in Nisibis. In 195, following a civil war in which the kingdom had supported his rival Pescennius Niger, Septimius Severus mounted an invasion and annexed the territory as a new province, making Nisibis the capital. However, the emperor did allow the king, Abgar XI, to retain the city of Edessa and a small territory surrounding it. In 213, the reigning king was deposed by Caracalla, and the remaining territory was incorporated into the Roman province of Osroene.

According to legends (without historical justification), by 201 AD or earlier, under King Abgar the Great, Osroene became the first Christian state. It is believed that the Gospel of Thomas emanated from Edessa around 140. Prominent early Christian figures have lived in and emerged from the region such as &quot;Tatian the Assyrian&quot;, who came to Edessa from Hadiab (Adiabene). He made a trip to Rome and returned to Edessa around 172–173. Tatian was the editor of the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, which was the primary sacred text of Syriac-speaking Christianity until in the 5th century the bishops Rabbula and Theodoret suppressed it and substituted a revision of the Old Syriac Canonical Gospels (as in the Syriac Sinaiticus and Curetonian Gospels).

Then, Edessa was again brought under Roman control by Decius and it was made a center of Roman operations against the Sasanian Empire. &quot;Amru&quot;, possibly a descendant of Abgar, is mentioned as king in the Paikuli inscription, recording the victory of Narseh in the Sassanid civil war of 293. Historians identify that Amru as &quot;Amru ibn Adi&quot;, the fourth king of the Lakhmids, which was then still based in Harran, not yet moved to al-Hirah in southern Mesopotamia.

Many centuries later, &quot;Dagalaiphus&quot; and &quot;Secundinus&quot; duke of Osrhoene, accompanied Julian in his war against the Sasanian emperor, Shapur II, in the 4th century.

==Roman province==


The independence of the state ended probably in ; during Caracalla&#x27;s reign the monarchy was abolished by the Roman Empire and Osroene was incorporated it as a province (&quot;colonia&quot;). It was a frontier province, lying close to the Persian empires with which the Romans were repeatedly at war, and was taken and retaken several times. As it was on the frontier it had a Roman legion stationed there. Legio III Parthica and its Castrum (homebase) may have been Rhesaina, but that is uncertain.

Following Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s tetrarchy reform during his reign (284-305), it was part of the diocese of the East, in the praetorian prefecture of the same name.

According to the late-4th-century &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, it was headed by a governor of the rank of &quot;praeses&quot;, and it was also the seat of the &quot;dux Mesopotamiae&quot;, who ranked as &quot;vir illustris&quot; and commanded (c. 400) the following army units:
*Equites Dalmatae Illyriciani, garrisoned at Ganaba.
*Equites Promoti Illyriciani, Callinicum.
*Equites Mauri Illyriciani, Dabana.
*Equites Promoti indigenae, Banasam
*Equites Promoti indigenae, Sina Iudaeorum.
*Equites Sagittarii indigenae, Oraba.
*Equites Sagittarii indigenae, Thillazamana.
*Equites Sagittarii indigenae Medianenses, Mediana.
*Equites Primi Osrhoeni, Rasin.
*Praefectus legionis quartae Parthicae, Circesium.
*(an illegible command, possibly Legio III &quot;Parthica&quot;), Apatna.
as well as, &#x27;on the minor roll&#x27;, apparently auxiliaries:
*Ala Septima Valeria Praelectorum, Thillacama.
*Ala Prima Victoriae, Tovia -contra Bintha.
*Ala Secunda Paflagonum, Thillafica.
*Ala Prima Parthorum, Resaia.
*Ala Prima nova Diocletiana, inter Thannurin et Horobam.
*Cohors Prima Gaetulorum, Thillaamana.
*Cohors Prima Eufratensis, Maratha.
*Ala Prima Salutaria, Duodecimo constituta.

According to Sozomen&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, &quot;there were some very learned men who formerly flourished in Osroene, as for instance Bardaisan, who devised a heresy designated by his name, and his son Harmonius. It is related that this latter was deeply versed in Grecian erudition, and was the first to subdue his native tongue to meters and musical laws; these verses he delivered to the choirs&quot; and that Arianism, a more successful heresy, met with opposition there.

<doc id="217133" wikidata="Q879439" url="?curid=217133" title="Probability vector">
<text>In mathematics and statistics, a probability vector or stochastic vector is a vector with non-negative entries that add up to one.

The positions (indices) of a probability vector represent the possible outcomes of a discrete random variable, and the vector gives us the probability mass function of that random variable, which is the standard way of characterizing a discrete probability distribution.

==Examples==
Here are some examples of probability vectors. The vectors can be either columns or rows.

*formula_1
*formula_2
*formula_3
*formula_4

==Geometric interpretation==
Writing out the vector components of a vector formula_5 as

:formula_6

the vector components must sum to one:

:formula_7

Each individual component must have a probability between zero and one:

:formula_8

for all formula_9. Therefore, the set of stochastic vectors coincides with the standard formula_10-simplex. It is a point if formula_11, a segment if formula_12, a (filled) triangle if formula_13, a (filled) tetrahedron if formula_14, etc.

==Properties==
* The mean of the components of any probability vector is formula_15.
* The shortest probability vector has the value formula_15 as each component of the vector, and has a length of formula_17.
* The longest probability vector has the value 1 in a single component and 0 in all others, and has a length of 1.
* The shortest vector corresponds to maximum uncertainty, the longest to maximum certainty.
* The length of a probability vector is equal to formula_18; where formula_19 is the variance of the elements of the probability vector.

==See also==
* Stochastic matrix
* Dirichlet distribution

<text>The [[history of anatomy]] in the 19th century saw anatomists largely finalise and systematise the descriptive human anatomy of the previous century. The discipline also progressed to establish growing sources of knowledge in histology and developmental biology, not only of humans but also of animals.

==Anatomical science==

===Sommerring===
Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring originally published a clear, accurate and precise system in German (1791–1796), then in Latin (1794–1800). There was a second German edition in 1800–1801 and a further eight-volume edition (1841–1844) revised and with additional material by Th.L.W. Bischoff, Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, E.H. Huschke, Theile, G.G. Valentin, , and Rudolph Wagner. The arrangement of the edition is:

*Vol. 1: Wagner details the life, correspondence and literary writings of Sommerring;
*Vol. 2: Anatomy of the bones and ligaments;
*Vol. 3: Anatomy of the muscles and the vascular system by Theile;
*Vol. 4: microscopic anatomy of the nervous system by Valentin, including the brain, the spinal cord, and the ganglia;
*Vol. 5: Anatomy of the organs by Huschke – this part of the work had been left incomplete by Sommerring but he had left extensive material to work on;
*Vol. 6: An entire and complete system of general anatomy, deduced from personal observation by Henle and other careful observers, the materials being in general new, and in all instances confirmed and rectified;
*Vol. 7: Developmental biology of mammals and humans, by Bischoff;
*Vol. 8: Pathological anatomy of the human body, by Vogel, but only the generalities of the subject.

This was translated into French by Jourdan, and published in 1846 under the name of &quot;Encyclopedie anatomique&quot;. The eighth volume was translated into English in the year 1847.

===Bichat===
The &quot;Anatomie Generale&quot; of Xavier Bichat is a monument of his scientific ability and scholarship. His &quot;Anatomie Descriptive&quot; is distinguished by clear and natural arrangement, precise and accurate description, and the general ingenuity with which the subject is treated. The physiological observations are in general correct, often novel, and always highly interesting. Bichat died during the preparation of the third volume and the work was completed by P.J. Roux and M.F.R. Buisson.

===Gray===
Henry Gray, an English anatomist and surgeon at St. George&#x27;s Hospital, published &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. With the artist abilities and help of Henry Vandyke Carter, Gray produced an inexpensive and accessible anatomy textbook for medical students. Dissecting unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital mortuaries through the Anatomy Act 1832, the two worked for 18 months on what would form the basis of the book. Their work was first published in 1858.

==Social and political issues==


The growth of medical science and medical practice created an increased demand for human cadavers for use in medical colleges, particularly for anatomy demonstrations. Before the 19th century, most were bodies of executed criminals or, more rarely, corpses donated by relatives. The reason being, having the body dissected after death was considered to be a fate worse than death. The Murder Act 1751 permitted that the bodies of murderers be dissected after death to contribute to medical knowledge. After the criminal was hanged, medical students would be there as the body was taken down from the gallows and would argue over who would dissect the body, making the anatomist as feared as the executioner himself. 

As demand began to outstrip supply, shortage of corpses often discouraged medical schools from scrutinizing their suppliers too closely. Criminal elements were attracted to the lucrative trade and resurrectionists, resorted to Body snatching to supply the market. The scale of the problem can be seen from the 1831 confessions of the London Burkers, who admitted to stealing 500–1000 bodies for anatomists, over a twelve-year career. They received 8–10 guineas for each cadaver accepted.

The practices of the body snatchers caused widespread fear and revulsion as the indignities and humiliation of exhumation were compounded by the horror of being the subject of dissection. The criminal temptations ultimately led to the 1827–1828 West Port murders in Edinburgh, UK, where likely candidates were killed and sold for cash. The murders led to the passing of the Anatomy Act 1832 which finally provided for an adequate and legitimate supply of corpses.

<doc id="217141" wikidata="Q1333790" url="?curid=217141" title="Gotō Islands">
<text>The are Japanese islands in the Sea of Japan. They are part of Nagasaki Prefecture.

== Geography ==

There are 140 islands, including five main ones: , , , , and . The northernmost island is Ukujima.

The group of islands runs approximately from Osezaki Lighthouse, Fukue Island to Tsuwazaki Lighthouse, Nakadōri Island. Its center is near Naru Island at about .

To the north is Tsushima Island in the Tsushima Strait and to the east is Kyūshū and the rest of Nagasaki Prefecture. It is about from the port of Nagasaki. The Tsushima Current (a branch of the Kuroshio) passes around the islands.

The southern of the two principal islands, Fukue, measures approximately north-to-south by east-to-west; the northern, Nakadōri Island, measures approximately north-to-south by east-to-west at its widest point. Most of Nakadōri Island, however, is quite narrow, measuring less than wide for much of its length. Some dome-shaped hills command the old castle town of Fukue. The islands are highly cultivated; deer and other game abound, and trout are plentiful in the mountain streams.

As a result of a merger on August 1, 2004, the city of Gotō was established. It occupies Fukue, Hisaka, and Naru islands, and seven inhabited ones. The town of Shin-Kamigotō, itself the product of a simultaneous, separate merger in 2004, occupies Nakadōri and Wakamatsu islands, two of the five main islands of the Gotō archipelago, in addition to the small inhabited islands of Arifuku, Kashiragashima, Hinoshima, Ryōzegaura, and Kirinoko and a great number of uninhabited islets.

The small island of Kabajima is east of Hisaka Island and northeast of Fukue Island. It belongs to Gotō City.

== Demographics ==
In 2005, there were 76,311 inhabitants on the islands. 

An important historical element is the roots of Christianity in Japan within the islands. Some of the inhabitants are descended from Christians of the Catholic Church (&quot;Kakure Kirishitan&quot;), who came to their faith upon the introduction of Christianity to Japan via Portuguese missionaries in the late 16th century. These Japanese were many times persecuted and tortured by the Japanese shogunates for their beliefs, all the way into the early Meiji period. Until recently Hanare Kirishitans still lived there; the majority either returned to Catholicism after it was legalized in the 19th century or reverted to earlier practices. The islands have numerous Catholic churches, the oldest and most famous of which is Dōzaki church, built in 1868 and located about north of Fukue port. The islands are part of the Archdiocese of Nagasaki.

== Products ==
Marine products, such as oysters and sea urchins, are the main products of the island. The natural camellia oil of Fukuejima is famous in Japan for cosmetic use. Kankoro Mochi is a confectionery and specialty food of the Gotō Islands made from sliced, sundried sweet potato combined with mochi.

== Tourism ==

Fukue City is a typical castle city. The historic castle in Fukue, Ishida Castle, was built last of all castles in Japanese history because year after the castle was completed Japan underwent the Meiji Restoration. Today, the castle is used as the Goto high school and is contributing to the education of young people. Most of the castle area inside the stone walls are opened for public.

==Transportation==
The Gotō-Fukue Airport (FUJ/RJFE) is on Fukue Island.

Ferry services from Nagasaki and Sasebo are offered by Kyusyu Shosen Co. Ltd. Both standard ferry and hydrofoil services operate.

There are also regular bus services on Fukue island.

<doc id="217149" wikidata="Q271969" url="?curid=217149" title="Purchasing power">
<text>Purchasing power refers to the amount of products and services available for purchase with a certain currency unit. For example, if you took one unit of cash to a store in the 1950s, you could buy more products than you could now, showing that the currency had more purchasing power back then.

If one&#x27;s income remains constant but prices rise, their purchasing power decreases. Inflation does not always result in decreased purchasing power, especially if income exceeds price levels. A larger real income means more purchasing power, as it corresponds to the income itself.

Traditionally, the purchasing power of money depended heavily upon the local value of gold and silver, but was also made subject to the availability and demand of certain goods on the market. Most modern fiat currencies, like US dollars, are traded against each other and commodity money in the secondary market for the purpose of international transfer of payment for goods and services.

Scottish economist Adam Smith noted that having money gives one the ability to &quot;command&quot; others&#x27; labor, so purchasing power to some extent is power over other people, to the extent that they are willing to trade their labor or goods for money or currency.

For a price index, its value in the base year is usually normalized to a value of 100. The purchasing power of a unit of currency, say a dollar, in a given year, expressed in dollars of the base year, is 100/&quot;P&quot;, where &quot;P&quot; is the price index in that year. So, by definition, the purchasing power of a dollar decreases as the price level rises.

Adam Smith used an hour&#x27;s labour as the purchasing power unit, so value would be measured in hours of labour required to produce a given quantity (or to produce some other good worth an amount sufficient to purchase the same).

<doc id="217151" wikidata="Q189128" url="?curid=217151" title="León, Guanajuato">
<text>León (), officially León de Los Aldama, is the most populous city and municipal seat of the municipality of León in the Mexican state of Guanajuato. In the 2020 Intercensal Survey, INEGI reported 1,721,626 people living in the municipality of León, making it the fourth-most populous municipality in Mexico. The metropolitan area of León recorded a population of 2,140,094 in the 2020 state Census, making it the seventh most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. León is part of the macroregion of Bajío within the Central Mexican Plateau.

León has a large leather industry, making shoes, boots, belts, jackets, and other leather accessories for national and international markets. The leather industry earned its inhabitants the nickname of &quot;green belly&quot; (&quot;panzaverde&quot; in Spanish) because of the green tainting in the workers&#x27; bodies resulting from treating leather. Its first-class services and hotel industry make it an important commercial center in Mexico with numerous options for entertainment, gastronomy, leisure activities, arts, and recreation. It is also considered one of the most environmentally friendly cities in Mexico and has a high number of cyclists, in part because of integrating a network of bike lanes into the SIT system. In March 2012, it received an award as &quot;City Water Champion&quot;, mainly due to great progress in the areas of sanitation, wastewater reuse, and energy cogeneration from biogas.

== History ==

=== Mesoamerica ===
In the León area there are ten distinct archeological zones, dating from the pre-classic Mesoamerican period. Most of these are identified with the Chupícuaro culture. By the Classic period, the area was under Teotihuacan and Toltec influence. In the 13th century, the Chichimecas, mostly of the Guamare and Guachichil subgroups, overran the area, migrating from an area of what is now San Luis Potosí. They remained through the Colonial period.

=== Colonial period ===
In 1530, Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán arrived with allied Tarasco Indians to the area, naming it Nuestra Señora. Homesteads were granted by the governor of Nueva Galicia Francisco Vásquez de Coronado to Spaniards Rodrigo de Vázquez and Juan de Jasso. Farming and cattle-raising were introduced here around 1546 by the Spaniards, but these settlers were under constant threat by the Chichimecas, who recognized the Spanish as invaders. These settlers requested assistance from the viceregal authorities in Mexico City.

As a response, viceroy Martín Enríquez de Almanza ordered the founding of a city here, with the name of León in 1575. To carry out the order, Juan Bautista de Orozco founded the village of León on 20 January 1576, creating its first town council and laying out its initial streets. In 1580, it attained the rank of &quot;alcadía mayor&quot; meaning it has governing authority of much of the land and smaller towns surrounding it from the Sierra de Comanja to the Lerma River. For example, two other towns founded in the area were San Miguel and Coecillo. In San Miguel, the Spaniards settled the Otomi peoples and in Coecillo were settled the Purépechas, Mexicas and the Chichimecas that did not oppose Spanish rule. As the population of the area grew, a number of municipalities would eventually break off, such as San Francisco del Rincón, Purísima del Rincón (Purísima Concepción), Cd. Manuel Doblado (San Pedro Piedra Gorda), Huanímaro, Abasolo, Cuerámaro and Pénjamo.

=== Jesuit reformer ===
In 1582, the first hospital of San Cosme y San Damián was established by Father Espino. The Jesuits arrived to León in 1731, founding the &quot;Compañía Vieja&quot; which is now the site of the Temple of the Immaculate. They also constructed the Temple of the New Company, which would become the cathedral, however they never finished it as they were expelled from Mexico in 1767. On 2 July 1732 arrived an image of Our Most Holy Mother of Light. She would later be declared the patron saint of the city, in 1849.

The population of the area suffered epidemics in 1643, droughts in 1630 and 1712–1714, famines in 1714 and 1786, and flooding in 1637, 1749, 1762, and 1803.

=== Mexican civil war ===
Independence forces under José Rafael de Iriarte arrived to the town on 4 October 1810. However, two months later royalist forces under Felix Calleja retook the locality, with insurrectionist sympathizers facing reprisals. About 2,000 insurgents on horses attacked the town but were repulsed by Count Pérez Gálvez. Royalist forces were attacked here in 1817 by Francisco Javier Mina without success. The town remained in royalist hands until the end of the Mexican War of Independence, when Agustín de Iturbide arrived. The town did not celebrate its first Grito de Dolores to mark independence until 1825. In 1827 it became one of the four &quot;departments&quot; of the newly created state of Guanajuato, and in 1830, it gained city status. In 1840, Father Ignacio Aguado founded the College of San Francisco de Sales and the College of La Madre Santísima was founded in 1844.

=== La Reforma ===
During La Reforma war, the city changed hands various times between Liberal and Conservative forces between 1858 and 1860. The most notable battle of that war here was when General José Iniesta attacked the town on 18 February 1859. In that same year, León even separated for a time from the rest of the state of Guanajuato.

In 1862, the bishopric of León was founded, separating the city of León and nine other municipalities such as Irapuato, Guanajuato and Dolores Hidalgo from the bishopric of Michoacán. Bishop Diez de Sollano opened the Conciliar Seminary in 1864. This bishop consecrated the Basilica Cathedral in 1866, even though it was not completed, giving the image of the Virgin of the Light a permanent home.

=== French occupation ===
From 1863 to 1866, the French occupied León during the French Intervention, with Emperor Maximillian visiting the city in 1864. His arrival was much celebrated here, with fireworks and a hot air balloon exhibition put on by the Alemán brothers. However, when Liberal forces finally had permanent control over the town, two incidents occurred. On 30 September 1867, Coronel Cecilio Delgado Estrada ordered his men to shoot over the heads of people who prayed in the streets, causing some to be wounded. Another incident of this type occurred in 1877. The second was more permanent. The Liberals decommissioned the convent and college of Saints Peter and Paul, converting it into offices for city government. It remains such to this day.

=== Contested elections ===
On 2 January 1946, a mob gathered in the plaza in front of the municipal palace to protest elections seen as illegitimate. These protesters were fired upon, killing many. This plaza has been named the &quot;Plaza of the Martyrs&quot; in their honor.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

Leon generally has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa) with summer rainfall (according to Köppen climate classification, Cwa) that closely borders on a semi-arid climate. The average annual temperature is , the warmest month is May with a maximum average of , and the coolest month is January with a minimum average temperature of . Outside the city microclimate island, the ranges tend to be higher, with maximum averages reaching 2 °C higher than in the city, and minimum averages lowered by 3 °C or more. In the villages located in between the northern mountains the climate changes; it is considered subtropical highland climate (Cwb according to Köppen climate classification), the average annual temperature is around .

Leon averages of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the summer and early autumn (from late May through October) generally with thunderstorms in the evening. There is usually a discrepancy about whether Leon&#x27;s valley is either sub-humid or semi-arid. Depending on the methodology, it can be considered as being either one or the other. With Köppen&#x27;s methodology, there needs to be more than of annual precipitation for Leon to be considered as humid subtropical; according to several weather stations it may have both (humid subtropical and semiarid) terminologies applied to it. The years considered in the study may also be a determinant factor (more frequently used for international purposes is a 30-year data compilation). Years of average rainfall are rare; the usual pattern is bi-modal, with some large string of dry years usually related to La Niña phenomenon (slightly higher than ) followed by other years (around 5) related to El Niño that make up the average (with higher than ). Snowfall is extremely rare. The latest snowfall recorded in Leon was in 1997, although there have been other years of registered slushy snow since 1997.

===Cityscape===
==Economy==

=== Industrial parks ===
About 70 percent of all shoes made in Mexico come from León and the surrounding area. In addition to the Leather crafting, there are also industrial chemical, plastic, polymer, transportation, and container companies. The presence of the automotive industry includes a General Motors plant in the nearby municipality of Silao. In the financial sector, León is home to the national headquarters of Banco del Bajío, owned by Salvador Oñate, and to the regional headquarters of Banamex, and HSBC, among other banks.

=== Customs facility ===
A newly built facility within GTO Inland Port&#x27;s premises speeds up the logistics process. Clearing customs in a border city or seaport is no longer a requirement for companies located in GTO Inland Port. Now they use this very convenient facility.
=== Rail container facility ===
A rail container yard is now offering inter-modal services for rail transportation. The facility is operated by the largest rail company in Mexico and has one of the longest rail spurs in the country.


=== Expositions ===
In the Poliforum there are trade fairs throughout the year. The principal two are Sapica (Shoe Fair), and ANPIC (suppliers of the shoe industry).

===Retailing===
León has several regional shopping malls: 
*Altacia, anchored by Liverpool, Cinépolis multicinemas and the Sealand aquarium, 
*City Center León (under construction), a mixed-use development with offices, 2 hotels, retail, apartments and a Cinépolis
*Factory Shops León, a ( 740-million-peso (38-million-USD) outlet mall)
*Plaza Galerías Las Torres, anchored by Walmart, Coppel and Cinépolis
*Plaza Mayor, the largest mall in León, 117,000 m2 gross leasable area, of which 70,000 m2 retail floor space, and parking for 2,500 cars. Anchored by sears, Liverpool (planned to expand to 27,000 m2, West Elm, Innovasport, Sanborns, and with a Best Buy under that company stopped operations in Mexico. It will add a ca. 30,000-m2 Palacio de Hierro under construction, to open in 2024. León is one of only eight metropolitan areas in Mexico to boast a full-line Palacio store, a reflection on that company&#x27;s hopes for the high-end retail potential of León and other nearby cities in El Bajío such as San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato city.

== Historic sites ==

=== Cathedral ===

The main church is called the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Light and is the seat of the Archdiocese of Leon. Construction of the church was begun in 1746 by the Jesuits and is a combination of Baroque and Neo Classic architectural styles. Construction was halted only eight months after it began when the Jesuit order was expelled from Mexico by the Spanish Crown. The Obregon family, however, took over its construction, continuing into the 19th century. The Archdiocese of Leon was created in 1864, with its first bishop, José María de Jesús Diez de Sollano y Dávalos helping to get the towers and cupola completed as he chose the church as the seat. It was finally completed and consecrated on 16 March 1866. Pope Benedict XVI officiated a mass here in 2012.

=== Expiatorio ===

Its full name is the Santuario Expiatorio del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús (Expiatory Sanctuary of the Sacred Heart of Jesus). Construction of this shrine was begun in 1920 by Bernardo Chavez with the support of Bishop Emeterio Valverde y Téllez. It is neo-Gothic in design, based on the old European medieval cathedrals but much of the outside wallspace is without decoration. Its work was halted by the Cristero Wars. Since then construction has continued off and on and it is considered 90% complete. An important source of income for the shrine&#x27;s construction is the sale of crypts. This practice was begun in 1924. A chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Lourdes was begun in 1935 and later a chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe, which is separate from the main building, built between 1935 and 1939. A shrine with stained glass windows includes local allegories.

=== Municipal Palace ===

The current Municipal Palace is of the Ionic order and occupies part of the site of the old &quot;Colegio Grande del Seminario de los Padres Paulinos&quot; (Grand Seminary College for Pauline Priests) who had to abandon the city in 1860.

From 1861 to 1867 it was a military barracks. After the French Intervention, it was remodeled to conserve its original architecture by Coronel Octaviano Rosado to become the seat of government on 21 March 1869. The patio of the building contains (in 1972) a bronze statue of Benito Juárez to commemorate the centennial of his death. Since then, the building has had a number of additions such as the dome that now covers this patio, and a number of murals. These murals were painted in 1972 and 1973 by Jesus Gallardo covering the walls of the main stairwell and the hallway of the upper floor around the patio.

=== Millennium&#x27;s Gate ===
The monument was built to celebrate the arrival of the new millennium and has become a landmark. The 45-meter tall tower on five plinths was completed on time for New Year&#x27;s Day 2000. The 5,400 square meter plaza is planted with trees. The project cost 4.5 million pesos.

=== Arch of the Causeway of the Heroes (Arco de la Calzada de los Héroes) ===

This arch (Arco de la Calzada de los Héroes, in Spanish), topped by a bronze lion, began construction in 1896 and has been modified a number of times since then. The first lion was added in 1943 by Francisco Lozornio Castillo made of bricks and mortar. This was replaced by the bronze one in 1958. The idea for a bronze lion was that of the matador Antonio Velázquez, a native of Leon, whose bravery in the ring earned him the nickname of the &quot;Heart of Leon&quot; (&quot;Corazón de León&quot;, in Spanish). Not long before his death in 1959, he complained that the brick lion should be replaced with a better work of art, causing something of a commotion in the Leon community. This caught the attention of sculptor Humberto Peraza Ojeda who made the one that sits atop the arch today.
== Arts and culture ==

== Explora Park ==
This recreational park is tailored towards families. The Explora park has walking paths and areas of green grass. There is a body of water in the park with a bridge. There is also a zip line, life-size aircraft, and a science building.

== Transportation ==
=== Del Bajío International Airport ===
The Del Bajío International Airport (Guanajuato International Airport) serves the city, although it is located in the neighboring city of Silao.

=== Cycling ===
The city&#x27;s bicycle paths are extensive. Leon is one of the most bicycle-friendly large cities in Latin America and has an extraordinary track record in active transport, keeping the biking and walking share above 39% of the total trips, one of the highest values in Latin American cities.

=== Integrated Transportation System ===

Integrated Transportation System (ITS) (Sistema Integrado de Transporte in Spanish) refers to the development and implementation of a Bus rapid transit system named &quot;Optibús&quot;. Since 28 September 2003, the Integrated Transport Optibús has operated despite an existing need for a subway system &quot;Metro&quot;, which originally was planned construction with two lines.

The system was the first of its kind in Mexico. Leon was the first city in the country with a BRT system, before it was implemented in Mexico City as Metrobús and Guadalajara as Macrobús.

Optibús System
The current route system is divided into four categories. These are:
* Trunk routes: They consist of eight main lines that cross the city from end to end. The buses are also known as &quot;Orugas&quot; (caterpillars in Spanish) due to its articulated midsection. They have capacity for 175 passengers. The Optibús transit system consists of 52 stations located in the central area of the main avenues of the city.
* Feeder and auxiliary routes: These are urban bus routes that were integrated into the regular system, as a stop as they have one or more transfer stations, and are identified by the letter A (feeder route / yellow decals) or X (auxiliary route / blue decals).
* Conventional routes: These routes circulate through most of the city and are distinguished by having the corporative colors from its owners: orange, red, pink, purple, and green.
* Suburban roads: Roads circulate outside or on the city edge communities as Comanjilla, Duarte, Loza de los Padres, La Hacienda, etc.

There are currently three permanent transfer stations (San Jeronimo, Delta de Jerez and San Juan Bosco), two micro-stations (Santa Rita - Parque Juarez), which are the endpoints for trunk routes, feeder routes and auxiliary routes. Passengers at these stations are allowed to transfer without cost from any of these lines.

In addition, as a control measure, the &quot;PagoBús&quot; system has been instituted; this is an electronic card system that allows users to streamline their access to stations and bus and thus save money. There are 2 types of cards: Preferential and General, cost rates with 50 and 15% lower total cost.

The environmental benefits of the system are also high, not least because the system introduced articulated buses using Euro IV technology and ultra low sulfur, resulting in 5,600 tons of reduction annually.

===Public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in León, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 78 min. 21% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 20 min, while 40% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.1 km, while 2% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

<text>A consumer price index (CPI) is a statistical estimate of the level of prices of goods and services bought for consumption purposes by households. It is calculated as the weighted average price of a market basket of consumer goods and services. Changes in CPI track changes in prices over time. The items in the basket are updated periodically to reflect changes in consumer spending habits. The prices of the goods and services in the basket are collected (often monthly) from a sample of retail and service establishments. The prices are then adjusted for changes in quality or features. Changes in the CPI can be used to track inflation over time and to compare inflation rates between different countries. While the CPI is not a perfect measure of inflation or the cost of living, it is a useful tool for tracking these economic indicators. It is one of several price indices calculated by many national statistical agencies.

==Overview==
A CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically. Sub-indices and sub-sub-indices can be computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services, which are combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index. The annual percentage change in the CPI is used as a measure of inflation. A CPI can be used to index (i.e., adjust for the effect of inflation) the real value of wages, salaries, and pensions; to regulate prices; and to deflate monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values. In most countries, the CPI is one of the most closely watched national economic statistics.

The index is usually computed monthly, or quarterly in some countries, as a weighted average of sub-indices for different components of consumer expenditure, such as food, housing, shoes, and clothing, each of which is, in turn, a weighted average of sub-sub-indices. At the most detailed level, the elementary aggregate level (for example, men&#x27;s shirts sold in department stores in San Francisco), detailed weighting information is unavailable, so indices are computed using an unweighted arithmetic or geometric mean of the prices of the sampled products. (However, the growing use of barcode scanner data is gradually making weighting information available even at the most detailed level.) These indices compare prices each month with prices in the price-reference month. The weights used to combine them into the higher-level aggregates and then into the overall index relate to the estimated expenditures during the preceding whole year of the consumers covered by the index on the products within its scope in the area covered. Thus, the index is a fixed-weight index but rarely a true Laspeyres index since the weight-reference period of a year and the price-reference period, usually a more recent single month, do not coincide.

Ideally, all price revalidations are accepted, and the weights would relate to the composition of expenditure during the time between the price-reference month and the current month. There is a large technical economics literature on index formulas that would approximate this and that can be shown to approximate what economic theorists call a true cost-of-living index. Such an index would show how consumer expenditure would have to move to compensate for price changes so as to allow consumers to maintain a constant standard of living. Approximations can only be computed retrospectively, whereas the index has to appear monthly and, preferably, quite soon. Nevertheless, in some countries, notably the United States and Sweden, the philosophy of the index is that it is inspired by and approximates the notion of a true cost of living (constant utility) index, whereas in most of Europe it is regarded more pragmatically.

The coverage of the index may be limited. Consumers&#x27; expenditure abroad is usually excluded; visitors&#x27; expenditure within the country may be excluded in principle if not in practice; the rural population may or may not be included; certain groups, such as the very rich or the very poor, may be excluded. Savings and investment are always excluded, though the prices paid for financial services provided by financial intermediaries may be included along with insurance.

The index reference period, usually called the base year, often differs both from the weight-reference period and the price-reference period. This is just a matter of rescaling the whole time series to make the value for the index reference period equal to 100. Annually revised weights are a desirable but expensive feature of an index; the older the weights, the greater the divergence between the current expenditure pattern and that of the weight reference period.

It is calculated and reported on a per region or country basis on a monthly and annual basis. International organizations like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report statistical figures like the consumer price index for many of its member countries. In the US the CPI is usually reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

An English economist by the name of Joseph Lowe first proposed the theory of price basket index in 1822. His fixed basket approach was relatively simple as Lowe computed the price of a list of goods in period 0 and compared the price of that same basket of goods in period 1. Since his proposed theories however were elementary, later economists built on his ideas to form our modern definition.

==Calculation==

=== For a single item ===
formula_1

or

formula_2
:&quot;Where 1 is usually the comparison year and CPI1 is usually an index of 100.&quot;

Alternatively, the CPI can be performed as formula_3. The &quot;updated cost&quot; (i.e. the price of an item at a given year, e.g.: the price of bread today) is divided by that of the initial year (the price of bread in 1970), then multiplied by one hundred.

=== For multiple Items ===
Many but not all price indices are weighted averages using weights that sum to 1 or 100.

Example: The prices of 85,000 items from 22,000 stores, and 35,000 rental units are added together and averaged. They are weighted this way: housing 41.4%; food and beverages 17.4%; transport 17.0%; medical care 6.9%; apparel 6.0%; entertainment 4.4%; other 6.9%. Taxes (43%) are not included in CPI computation.

==Weighting==

===Weights and sub-indices===
By convention, weights are fractions or ratios summing to one, as percentages summing to 100 or as per mile numbers summing to 1000.

On the European Union&#x27;s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), for example, each country computes some 80 prescribed sub-indices, their weighted average constituting the national HICP. The weights for these sub-indices will consist of the sum of the weights of a number of component lower level indices. The classification is according to use, developed in a national accounting context. This is not necessarily the kind of classification that is most appropriate for a consumer price index. Grouping together of substitutes or of products whose prices tend to move in parallel might be more suitable.

For some of these lower-level indices detailed reweighting to make them be available, allowing computations where the individual price observations can all be weighted. This may be the case, for example, where all selling is in the hands of a single national organization which makes its data available to the index compilers. For most lower level indices, however, the weight will consist of the sum of the weights of a number of elementary aggregate indices, each weight corresponding to its fraction of the total annual expenditure covered by the index. An &#x27;elementary aggregate&#x27; is a lowest-level component of expenditure: this has a weight, but the weights of each of its sub-components are usually lacking. Thus, for example: Weighted averages of elementary aggregate indices (e.g. for men&#x27;s shirts, raincoats, women&#x27;s dresses, etc.) make up low-level indices (e.g. outer garments).

Weight averages of these, in turn, provide sub-indices at a higher, more aggregated level (e.g. clothing) and weighted averages of the latter provide yet more aggregated sub-indices (e.g. Clothing and Footwear).

Some of the elementary aggregate indices and some of the sub-indices can be defined simply in terms of the types of goods and/or services they cover. In the case of such products as newspapers in some countries and postal services, which have nationally uniform prices. But where price movements do differ or might differ between regions or between outlet types, separate regional and/or outlet-type elementary aggregates are ideally required for each detailed category of goods and services, each with its own weight. An example might be an elementary aggregate for sliced bread sold in supermarkets in the Northern region.

Most elementary aggregate indices are necessarily &#x27;unweighted&#x27; averages for the sample of products within the sampled outlets. However, in cases where it is possible to select the sample of outlets from which prices are collected so as to reflect the shares of sales to consumers of the different outlet types covered, self-weighted elementary aggregate indices may be computed. Similarly, if the market shares of the different types of products represented by product types are known, even only approximately, the number of observed products to be priced for each of them can be made proportional to those shares.

===Estimating weights===
The outlet and regional dimensions noted above mean that the estimation of weights involves a lot more than just the breakdown of expenditure by types of goods and services, and the number of separately weighted indices composing the overall index depends upon two factors:
# The degree of detail to which available data permit breakdown of total consumption expenditure in the weight reference-period by type of expenditure, region and outlet type.
# Whether there is reason to believe that price movements vary between these most detailed categories.

How the weights are calculated, and in how much detail, depends upon the availability of information and upon the scope of the index. In the UK the retail price index (RPI) does not relate to the whole of consumption, for the reference population is all private households with the exception of pensioner households that derive at least three-quarters of their total income from state pensions and benefits, and &quot;high income households&quot; whose total household income lies within the top four per cent of all households. The result is that it is difficult to use data sources relating to total consumption by all population groups.

For products whose price movements can differ between regions and between different types of outlet:
* The ideal, rarely realizable in practice, would consist of estimates of expenditure for each detailed consumption category, for each type of outlet, for each region.
* At the opposite extreme, with no regional data on expenditure totals but only on population (e.g. 24% in the Northern region) and only national estimates for the shares of different outlet types for broad categories of consumption (e.g. 70% of food sold in supermarkets) the weight for sliced bread sold in supermarkets in the Northern region has to be estimated as the share of sliced bread in total consumption × 0.24 × 0.7.

The situation in most countries comes somewhere between these two extremes. The point is to make the best use of whatever data are available.

Due to differences in weightings in the consumer basket, different price indices may be calculated for groups with various demographic characteristics. For example, consumer price indices calculated according to the weightings in the consumer basket of income groups may show significantly different trends.

===The nature of the data used for weighting===
No firm rules can be suggested on this issue for the simple reason that the available statistical sources differ between countries. However, all countries conduct periodical household-expenditure surveys and all produce breakdowns of consumption expenditure in their national accounts. The expenditure classifications used there may however be different. In particular:
* Household-expenditure surveys do not cover the expenditures of foreign visitors, though these may be within the scope of a consumer price index.
* National accounts include imputed rents for owner-occupied dwellings which may not be within the scope of a consumer price index.

Even with the necessary adjustments, the national-account estimates and household-expenditure surveys usually diverge.

The &quot;statistical sources&quot; required for regional and outlet-type breakdowns are usually weak. Only a large-sample Household Expenditure survey can provide a regional breakdown. Regional population data are sometimes used for this purpose, but need adjustment to allow for regional differences in living standards and consumption patterns. Statistics of retail sales and market research reports can provide information for estimating outlet-type breakdowns, but the classifications they use rarely correspond to COICOP categories.

The increasingly widespread use of bar codes, scanners in shops has meant that detailed cash register printed receipts are provided by shops for an increasing share of retail purchases. This development makes possible improved Household Expenditure surveys, as Statistics Iceland has demonstrated. Survey respondents keeping a diary of their purchases need to record only the total of purchases when itemized receipts were given to them and keep these receipts in a special pocket in the diary. These receipts provide not only a detailed breakdown of purchases but also the name of the outlet. Thus response burden is markedly reduced, accuracy is increased, product description is more specific and point of purchase data are obtained, facilitating the estimation of outlet-type weights.

There are only two general principles for the estimation of weights: use all the available information and accept that rough estimates are better than no estimates.

===Reweighting===
Ideally, in computing an index, the weights would represent current annual expenditure patterns. In practice, they necessarily reflect past using the most recent data available or, if they are not of high quality, some average of the data for more than one previous year. Some countries have used a three-year average in recognition of the fact that household survey estimates are of poor quality. In some cases, some of the data sources used may not be available annually, in which case some of the weights for lower-level aggregates within higher-level aggregates are based on older data than the higher level weights.

Infrequent reweighting saves costs for the national statistical office but delays the introduction into the index of new types of expenditure. For example, subscriptions for Internet service entered index compilation with a considerable time lag in some countries, and account could be taken of digital camera prices between re-weightings only by including some digital cameras in the same elementary aggregate as film cameras.

==Owner-occupiers and the price index==
The way in which owner-occupied dwellings should be dealt with in a consumer price index has been, and remains, a subject of heated controversy in many countries. Various approaches have been considered, each with their advantages and disadvantages.

===Economists&#x27; approach===
Leaving aside the quality of public services, the environment, crime, and so forth, and regarding the standard of living as a function of the level and composition of individuals&#x27; consumption, this standard depends upon the amount and range of goods and services they consume. These include the service provided by rented accommodation, which can readily be priced, and the similar services yielded by a flat or house owned by the consumer who occupies it. Its cost to a consumer is, according to the economic way of thinking, an &quot;opportunity cost,&quot; namely what he or she sacrifices by living in it. This cost, according to many economists, should form a component of a consumer price index.

Opportunity cost can be looked at in two ways, since there are two alternatives to continuing to live in an owner-occupied dwelling. One, supposing that it is one year&#x27;s cost that is to be considered, is to sell it, earn interest on the owner&#x27;s capital thus released, and buy it back a year later, making an allowance for its physical depreciation. This can be called the &quot;alternative cost&quot; approach. The other, the &quot;rental equivalent&quot; approach, is to let it to someone else for the year, in which case the cost is the rent that could be obtained for it.

There are practical problems in implementing either of these economists&#x27; approaches. Thus, with the alternative cost approach, if house prices are rising fast, the cost can be negative and then become sharply positive once house prices start to fall, so such an index would be very volatile. On the other hand, with the rental equivalent approach, there may be difficulty estimating the movement of rental values for types of property that are not actually rented. If one or other of these measures of the consumption of the services of owner-occupied dwellings is included in consumption, then it must be included in income too, for income equals consumption plus saving. This means that if the movement of incomes is to be compared with the movement of the consumer price index, incomes must be expressed as money income plus this imaginary consumption value. That is logical, but it may not be what users of the index want.

Although the argument has been expressed in connection with owner-occupied dwellings, the logic applies equally to all durable consumer goods and services. Furniture, carpets, and domestic appliances are not used up soon after purchase in the way that food is. Like dwellings, they yield a consumption service that can continue for years. Furthermore, since strict logic is to be adhered to, there are durable services as well that ought to be treated in the same way; the services consumers derive from appendectomies or crowned teeth continue for a long time. Since estimating values for these components of consumption has not been tackled, economic theorists are torn between their desire for intellectual consistency and their recognition that including the opportunity cost of the use of durables is impracticable.

===Spending===
Another approach is to concentrate on spending. Everyone agrees that repairs and maintenance expenditures for owner-occupied dwellings should be covered by a consumer price index, but the spending approach would include mortgage interest too. This turns out to be quite complicated, both conceptually and in practice.

To explain what is involved, consider a consumer price index computed with reference to 2009 for just one sole consumer who bought her house in 2006, financing half of this sum by raising a mortgage. The problem is to compare how much interest such a consumer would now be paying with the interest that was paid in 2009. Since the aim is to compare like with like, that requires an estimate of how much interest would be paid now in the year 2010 on a similar house bought and 50% mortgage-financed three years ago, in 2007. It does not require an estimate of how much that identical person is paying now on the actual house she bought in 2006, even though that is what personally concerns her now.

A consumer price index compares how much it would cost now to do exactly what consumers did in the reference period with what it cost then. Application of the principle thus requires that the index for our one house owner reflect the movement of the prices of houses like hers from 2006 to 2007 and the change in interest rates. If she took out a fixed-interest mortgage, it is the change in interest rates from 2006 to 2007 that counts; if she took out a variable-interest mortgage, it is the change from 2009 to 2010 that counts. Thus, her current index with 1999 as a reference period will stand at more than 100 if house prices or, in the case of a fixed-interest mortgage, interest rates rose between 2006 and 2007.

The application of this principle in the owner-occupied dwellings component of a consumer price index is known as the &quot;debt profile&quot; method. It means that the current movement of the index will reflect past changes in dwelling prices and interest rates. Some people regard this as odd. Quite a few countries use the debt profile method, but in doing so, most of them behave inconsistently. Consistency would require that the index also cover the interest on consumer credit instead of the whole price paid for the products bought on credit if it covers mortgage interest payments. Products bought on credit would then be treated in the same way as owner-occupied dwellings.

Variants of the debt profile method are employed or have been proposed. One example is to include down payments as well as interest. Another is to correct nominal mortgage rates for changes in dwelling prices or for changes in the rest of the consumer price index to obtain a &quot;real&quot; rate of interest. Also, other methods may be used alongside the debt profile method. Thus, several countries include a purely notional cost of depreciation as an additional index component, applying an arbitrarily estimated, or rather guessed, depreciation rate to the value of the stock of owner-occupied dwellings. Finally, one country includes both mortgage interest and purchase prices in its index.

===Transaction prices===
The third approach simply treats the acquisition of owner-occupied dwellings in the same way as acquisitions of other durable products are treated. This means:

* Taking account of the transaction prices agreed,
* ignoring whether payments are delayed or are partly financed by borrowing;
* leaving out second-hand transactions. Second-hand purchases correspond to sales by other consumers. Thus, only new dwellings would be included.

Furthermore, expenditure on enlarging or reconstructing an owner-occupied dwelling would be covered, in addition to regular maintenance and repair. Two arguments of almost theological character are advanced in connection with this transactional approach.

One argument is that purchases of new dwellings are treated as &quot;investment&quot; in the system of national accounts and should not enter a consumption price index. It is said that this is more than just a matter of terminological uniformity. For example, it may be thought to help understand and facilitate economic analysis if what is included under the heading &quot;consumption&quot; is the same in the consumer price index and in the national income and expenditure accounts. Since these accounts include the equivalent rental value of owner-occupied dwellings, the equivalent rental approach would have to be applied to the consumer price index too. But the national accounts do not apply it to other durables, so the argument demands consistency in one respect but accepts its rejection in another.

The other argument is that the prices of new dwellings should exclude that part reflecting the value of the land, since this is an irreproducible and permanent asset that cannot be said to be consumed. This would presumably mean deducting site value from the price of a dwelling, with site value being defined as the price the site would fetch at auction if the dwelling were not on it. How this is to be understood in the case of multiple dwellings remains unclear. 

===Confusion===
The merits of the different approaches are multidimensional, including feasibility, views on the way the index should and would move in particular circumstances, and theoretical properties of the index.

Statisticians in a country lacking a good dwelling price index (which is required for all except the rental equivalent method) will go along with a proposal to use such an index only if they can obtain the necessary additional resources that will enable them to compile one. Even obtaining mortgage interest rate data can be a major task in a country with a multitude of mortgage lenders and many types of mortgages. Dislike of the effect on the behavior of the consumer price index arising from the adoption of some methods can be a powerful, if sometimes unprincipled, argument.

Dwelling prices are volatile, so there would be an index incorporating the current value of a dwelling price sub-index, which, in some countries, would have a large weight under the third approach. Furthermore, the weight for owner-occupied dwellings could be altered considerably when reweighting is undertaken. (It could even become negative under the alternative cost approach if weights were estimated for a year during which house prices had been rising steeply.)

Then, there is the point that a rise in interest rates designed to halt inflation could paradoxically make inflation appear higher if current interest rates showed up in the index. Economists&#x27; principles are not acceptable to all, nor is their insistence on consistency between the treatment of owner-occupied dwellings and other durables.

== In the United States ==


In the United States several different consumer price indices are routinely computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These include the CPI-U (for all urban consumers), CPI-W (for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers), CPI-E (for the elderly), and C-CPI-U (chained CPI for all urban consumers). These are all built over two stages. First, the BLS collects data to estimate 8,018 separate item–area indices reflecting the prices of 211 categories of consumption items in 38 geographical areas. In the second stage, weighted averages are computed of these 8,018 item–area indices. The different indices differ only in the weights applied to the different 8,018 item–area indices. The weights for CPI-U and CPI-W are held constant for 24 months, changing in January of even-numbered years. The weights for C-CPI-U are updated each month to reflecting changes in consumption patterns in the last month. Thus, if people on average eat more chicken and less beef or more apples and fewer oranges than the previous month, that change would be reflected in next month&#x27;s C-CPI-U. However, it would not be reflected in CPI-U and CPI-W until January of the next even-numbered year.

This allows the BLS to compute consumer price indices for each of the designated 38 geographical areas and for aggregates like the Midwest.

In January of each year, Social Security recipients receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) &quot;to ensure that the purchasing power of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits is not eroded by inflation. It is based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)&quot;. The use of CPI-W conflicts with this purpose, because the elderly consume substantially more health care goods and services than younger people. In recent years, inflation in health care has substantially exceeded inflation in the rest of the economy. Since the weight on health care in CPI-W is much less than the consumption patterns of the elderly, this COLA does not adequately compensate them for the real increases in the costs of the items they buy.

The BLS does track a consumer price index for the elderly (CPI-E). It is not used, in part because the social security trust fund is forecasted to run out of money in roughly 40 years, and using the CPI-E instead of CPI-W would shorten that by roughly five years.

The most recent December 2021 CPI reading hit 7%, the highest level in over 40 years. In response Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve has begun Quantitative tightening with rate hikes expected to begin in March 2022.

===History===

The CPI for various years are listed below with 1982 as the base year: 
A CPI of 150 means that there was 50% increase in prices, or 50% inflation, since 1982. 


=== Chained CPI ===

Former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former U.S. Senator Alan K. Simpson suggested a transition to using a &quot;chained CPI&quot; in 2010, when they headed the White House&#x27;s deficit-reduction commission. They stated that it was a more accurate measure of inflation than the current system and switching from the current system could save the government more than $290 billion over the decade following their report. &quot;The chained CPI is usually 0.25 to 0.30 percentage points lower each year, on average, than the standard CPI measurements&quot;.

However, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Associations said that the chained CPI does not account for seniors citizens&#x27; health care costs. Robert Reich, former United States Secretary of Labor under President Clinton, noted that typical seniors spend between 20 and 40 percent of their income on health care, far more than most Americans. &quot;Besides, Social Security isn&#x27;t in serious trouble. The Social Security trust fund is flush for at least two decades. If we want to ensure it&#x27;s there beyond that, there&#x27;s an easy fix – just lift the ceiling on income subject to Social Security taxes, which is now $113,700.&quot;

Replacing the current cost-of-living adjustment calculation with the chained CPI was considered, but not adopted, as part of a deficit-reduction proposal to avert the sequestration cuts, or fiscal cliff, in January 2013, but President Obama included it in his April 2013 budget proposal.

===Personal consumption expenditures price index===

Because of some shortcomings of the CPI, notably that it uses static expenditure weighting and it does not account for the substitution effect, the PCEPI is an alternative price index used by the Federal Reserve, among others, to measure inflation. From January 1959 through July 2018, inflation measured by the PCEPI has averaged 3.3%, while it has averaged 3.8% using CPI.

<text>Celaya (; Otomi: ) is a city and its surrounding municipality in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico, located in the southeast quadrant of the state. It is the third most populous city in the state, with a 2005 census population of 310,413. The municipality for which the city serves as municipal seat, had a population of 415,869. The city is located in the geographic center of the municipality, which has an areal extent of and includes many smaller outlying communities, the largest of which are San Miguel Octopan, Rincón de Tamayo and San Juan de la Vega.

There are many smaller towns around Celaya including Rincón de Tamayo, Tarimoro, Villagrán, La Moncada, Panales Jamaica (Cañones), Panales Galera, La Calera, La Estancia, La Noria, Los Fierros, El Acebuche, Cacalote, and Charco Largo. It is also not far away from Cortazar, Salamanca, Salvatierra, Apaseo el Grande, Querétaro City and among others. The city was founded in 1570 as &quot;Villa de la Purisíma Concepción de Zalaya&quot;. The word Zalaya is of Basque origin and means &quot;Flat Land&quot;.

== History ==
Celaya was a frontier region between the Purépecha and the Chichimecas.

General Álvaro Obregón defeated Pancho Villa in the Battle of Celaya in 1915, as referred by Martínez Celaya was also the Guanajuato state capital for a short period.

An explosion in a gunpowder and fireworks warehouse in September, 1999, killed over 60 people and injured over 300 people.
On 23 May 2022, eleven people were murdered in a massacre linked to the Mexican drug war.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Celaya has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh).

===Ball of Water===
The Ball of Water reservoir has been a city icon since 1908; it continues to supply water to portions of downtown. The tank was manufactured in Germany and assembled on site, and is unique in being assembled using rivets rather than welds. It is believed to be the only one of its kind with a spherical shape (it is rumored that there was another similar water ball in Stuttgart, Germany that was destroyed during the Second World War). Traditionally, locals tell visitors that it is filled with cajeta, taking them to visit the &quot;Bola del Agua&quot; on Sundays, the traditional day for visiting the Independencia Lane. A plaque at the base of the water tower features the legend (in Spanish):

The work was carried out under the command of German Enrique Schöndube, although it is known that payment for the construction took ten years due to the start of the Mexican Revolution, so it was paid once the new government established. During the Mexican Revolution, Villa&#x27;s officers thought the hydraulic tower had such a large amount of water that destroying it would drown the population of Celaya. One of Villa&#x27;s generals ordered his artillery to destroy it. Captain Gustavo Duron, in charge of a 75mm battery, followed the orders but shot around the tower, avoiding it and protecting the monument, as mentioned by local historian Herminio Martínez. The construction resulted in the neglect of the people handing out water at home from the mayor&#x27;s office called water carriers. Commercial advertising on its surface was allowed for several years to cover the costs of the reservoir, ending on September 8, 1980, when, in celebration of upcoming 410th Anniversary of the Foundation of Celaya, the mayor in charge decreed that the Ball of Water would be a symbol that would represent the city, and the placement of advertisements was banned.

===Cuisine===
Celaya is also known for the artisanal production of cajeta, a type of milk candy.

==Transportation==
The Celaya Airport had (as of January 22, 2007) commercial flights to Santiago de Querétaro and connections from there to other destinations; these services were dropped in 2008. Celaya lies along the El Paso Spur of the Pan-American Highway which is known locally as Mexican Federal Highway 45.

<doc id="217157" wikidata="Q796024" url="?curid=217157" title="GDP deflator">
<text>In economics, the GDP deflator (implicit price deflator) is a measure of the money price of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy in a year relative to the real value of them. It can be used as a measure of the value of money. GDP stands for gross domestic product, the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within the territory of a country over a particular period of time (quarterly or annually).

Like the consumer price index (CPI), the GDP deflator is a measure of price inflation/deflation with respect to a specific base year; the GDP deflator of the base year itself is equal to 100. Unlike the CPI, the GDP deflator is not based on a fixed basket of goods and services; the &quot;basket&quot; for the GDP deflator is allowed to change from year to year with people&#x27;s consumption and investment patterns.

==Calculation==

===Measurement in national accounts===

In most systems of national accounts the GDP deflator measures the ratio of nominal (or current-price) GDP to the real (or chain volume) measure of GDP. The formula used to calculate the deflator is:

: formula_1

The nominal GDP of a given year is computed using that year&#x27;s prices, while the real GDP of that year is computed using the base year&#x27;s prices.

The formula implies that dividing the nominal GDP by the real GDP and multiplying it by 100 will give the GDP Deflator, hence &quot;deflating&quot; the nominal GDP into a real measure.

It is often useful to consider implicit price deflators for certain subcategories of GDP, such as computer hardware. In this case, it is useful to think of the price deflator as the ratio of the current-year price of a good to its price in some base year. The price in the base year is normalized to 100. For example, for computer hardware, we could define a &quot;unit&quot; to be a computer with a specific level of processing power, memory, hard drive space and so on. A price deflator of 200 means that the current-year price of this computing power is twice its base-year price - price inflation. A price deflator of 50 means that the current-year price is half the base year price - price deflation. This can lead to a situation where official statistics reflect a drop in real prices, even though they nominally have stayed the same. 

Unlike some price indices (like the CPI), the GDP deflator is not based on a fixed basket of goods and services. The basket is allowed to change with people&#x27;s consumption and investment patterns. Specifically, for the GDP deflator, the &quot;basket&quot; in each year is the set of all goods that were produced domestically, weighted by the market value of the total consumption of each good. Therefore, new expenditure patterns are allowed to show up in the deflator as people respond to changing prices. The theory behind this approach is that the GDP deflator reflects up to date expenditure patterns. For instance, if the price of chicken increases relative to the price of beef, people may spend more money on beef as a substitute for chicken.

In practice, the difference between the deflator and a price index like the Consumer price index (CPI) is often relatively small. On the other hand, with governments in developed countries increasingly utilizing price indexes for everything from fiscal and monetary planning to payments to social program recipients, even small differences between inflation measures can shift budget revenues and expenses by millions or billions of dollars.
