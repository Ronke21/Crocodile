<text>A single parent is a person who has a child or children but does not have a spouse or live-in partner to assist in the upbringing or support of the child. Reasons for becoming a single parent include death, divorce, break-up, abandonment, becoming widowed, domestic violence, rape, childbirth by a single person or single-person adoption. A &quot;single parent family&quot; is a family with children that is headed by a single parent.

==History==
Single parenthood has been common historically due to parental mortality rate due to disease, wars, homicide, work accidents and maternal mortality. Historical estimates indicate that in French, English, or Spanish villages in the 17th and 18th centuries at least one-third of children lost one of their parents during childhood; in 19th-century Milan, about half of all children lost at least one parent by age 20; in 19th-century China, almost one-third of boys had lost one parent or both by the age of 15. Such single parenthood was often short in duration, since remarriage rates were high.

Divorce was generally rare historically (although this depends on culture and era), and became especially difficult to obtain after the fall of the Roman Empire, in Medieval Europe, due to strong involvement of ecclesiastical courts in family life (though annulment and other forms of separation were more common).

Single parent adoptions have existed since the mid 19th century. Men were rarely considered as adoptive parents, and were considered far less desired. Often, children adopted by a single person were raised in pairs rather than alone, and many adoptions by lesbians and gay men were arranged as single parent adoptions. During the mid 19th century many state welfare officials made it difficult if not impossible for single persons to adopt, as agencies searched for married heterosexual couples. In 1965, the Los Angeles Bureau of Adoptions sought single African-Americans for African-American orphans for whom married families could not be found. In 1968, the Child Welfare League of America stated that married couples were preferred, but there were &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; where single parent adoptions were permissible.

==Demographics==

===Households===
Among all households in OECD countries in 2011, the proportion of single-parent households was in 3-11% the range, with an average of 7.5%. It was highest in Australia (10%), Canada (10%), Mexico (10%), United States (10%), Lithuania (10%), Costa Rica (11%), Latvia (11%) and New Zealand (11%), while it was lowest in Japan (3%), Greece (4%), Switzerland (4%), Bulgaria (5%), Croatia (5%), Germany (5%), Italy (5%) and Cyprus (5%). The proportion was 9% in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Among households with children in 2005/09, the proportion of single-parent households was 10% in Japan, 16% in the Netherlands, 19% in Sweden, 20% in France, 22% in Denmark, 22% in Germany, 23% in Ireland, 25% in Canada, 25% in the United Kingdom, and 30% in the United States. The U.S. proportion increased from 20% in 1980 to 30% in 2008.

In all OECD countries, most single-parent households were headed by a mother. The proportion headed by a father varied between 9% and 25%. It was lowest in Estonia (9%), Costa Rica (10%), Cyprus (10%), Japan (10%), Ireland (10%) and the United Kingdom (12%), while it was highest in Norway (22%), Spain (23%), Sweden (24%), Romania (25%) and the United States (25%). These numbers were not provided for Canada, Australia or New Zealand.

===Children===
In 2016/17, the proportion of children living in a single-parent household varied between 6% and 28% in the different OECD countries, with an OECD country average of 17%. It was lowest in Turkey (2015, 6%), Greece (8%), Croatia (8%) and Poland (10%), while it was highest in France (23%), United Kingdom (23%), Belgium (25%), Lithuania (25%), United States (27%) and Latvia (28%). It was 19% in Ireland and Canada.

Among children living in a single-parent household, most live primarily with their mother, others primarily with their father, while other children have a shared parenting arrangement where they spend an approximately equal amount of time with their two parents. Among those living primarily with one single parent, most live with their mother. In 2016 (or latest year available), the proportion of 6-12 year olds living primarily with their single father ranged between 5% and 36% among the different OECD countries. It was highest in Belgium (17%), Iceland (19%), Slovenia (20%), France (22%), Norway (23%) and Sweden (36%), while it was lowest in Lithuania (4%), Ireland (5%), Poland (5%), Estonia (7%), Austria (7%) and the United Kingdom (8%). It was 15% in the United States.

In 2005/06, the proportion of 11- to 15-year-old children living in a shared parenting arrangement versus with only one of their parents varied between 1% and 17%, being the highest in Sweden. It was 5% in Ireland and the United States, and 7% in Canada and the United Kingdom. By 2016/17, the percentage in Sweden had increased to 28%.

== Impact on parents ==
Over 9.5 million American families are run by one woman. Single mothers are likely to have mental health issues, financial hardships, live in a low income area, and receive low levels of social support. All of these factors are taken into consideration when evaluating the mental health of single mothers. The occurrence of moderate to severe mental disability was more pronounced among single mothers at 28.7% compared to partnered mothers at 15.7%. These mental disabilities include but are not limited to anxiety and depression. Financial hardships also affect the mental health of single mothers. Women, ages 15–24, were more likely to live in a low socio-economic area, have one child, and not to have completed their senior year of high school. These women reported to be in the two lowest income areas, and their mental health was much poorer than those in higher income areas.

A similar study on the mental health of single mothers attempted to answer the question, &quot;Are there differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, between married, never-married, and separated/divorced mothers?&quot; Statistically, never married, and separated/divorced mothers had the highest regularities of drug abuse, personality disorder and PTSD. The family structure can become a trigger for mental health issues in single mothers. They are especially at risk for having higher levels of depressive symptoms.

Studies from the 1970s showed that single mothers who are not financially stable are more likely to experience depression. In a more current study it was proven that financial strain was directly correlated with high levels of depression. Among low-income single mothers, depressive symptoms may be as high as 60%.

Inadequate access to mental health care services is prevalent amongst impoverished women. Low-income women are less likely to receive mental health care for numerous reasons. Mental health services remain inequitable for low-income, more so, low-income single women are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and other poor mental health outcomes. Researchers Copeland and Snyder (2011) addressed the barriers low-income single mothers have on receiving mental health care, &quot;Visible barriers often include the lack of community resources, transportation, child care, convenient hours, and financial resources.&quot; Meanwhile, low-income single mothers are more likely to bring their children in for mental health treatment than themselves. Researchers Copeland and Snyder analyzed sixty-four African American mothers who brought their children in for mental health treatment. These mothers were then screened for mild, moderate, and severe depression and/or anxiety. After three months the researchers used an ethnographic interview to address whether or not the participants used mental health services that were referred to them. Results indicated that the majority of the participants did not use the referred mental health care services for reasons that included: fear of losing their children, being hospitalized and/or stigmatized by their community counterparts.

== Impact on children ==
According to David Blankenhorn, Patrick Fagan, Mitch Pearlstein David Popenoe and Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, living in a single parent family is strongly correlated with school failure and problems of delinquency, drug use, teenage pregnancies, poverty, and welfare dependency in the United States. Using multilevel modelling, Suet-Ling Pong has shown that a high proportion of American children from single parent families perform poorly on mathematics and reading achievement tests.

In Sweden, Emma Fransson et al. have shown that children living with one single parent have worse well-being in terms of physical health behavior, mental health, peer friendships, bullying, cultural activities, sports, and family relationships, compared to children from intact families. As a contrast, children in a shared parenting arrangement that live approximately equal amount of time with their divorced mother and father have about the same well-being as children from intact families and better outcomes than children with only one custodial parent.

The United Kingdom Office for National Statistics has reported that children of single parents, after controlling for other variables like family income, are more likely to have problems, including being twice as likely to suffer from mental illness. Both British and American researchers show that children with no fathers are three times more likely to be unhappy, and are also more likely to engage in anti-social behavior, abuse substances and engage in juvenile deliquency.

== Causes of single-parenthood ==
===Widowed parents===
Historically, death of a partner was a common cause of single parenting. Diseases and maternal death not infrequently resulted in a widower or widow responsible for children. At certain times wars might also deprive significant numbers of families of a parent. Improvements in sanitation and maternal care have decreased mortality for those of reproductive age, making death a less common cause of single parenting.

===Divorced parents===

Child custody in reference to divorce refers to which parent is allowed to make important decisions about the children involved. Physical custody refers to which parent the child lives with. Among divorced parents, &quot;parallel parenting&quot; refers to parenting after divorce in which each parent does so independently; this is most common. In comparison, cooperative parenting occurs when the parents involved in the child&#x27;s life work together around all involved parties&#x27; schedules and activities, and this is far less common. After a certain &quot;crisis period,&quot; most children resume normal development; however, their future relationships are often affected, as they lack a model upon which to base a healthy long-term relationship. Nonetheless, as adults children of divorcees cope better with change.

Keeping in touch with both parents and having a healthy relationship with both mother and father appears to have the most effect on a child&#x27;s behavior; which leads to an easier time coping with the divorce as well as development through the child&#x27;s life. Children will do better with their parents divorce if they have a smooth adjustment period. One way to make this adjustment easier on children is to let them &quot;remain in the same neighborhoods and schools following divorce.&quot;

===Unintended pregnancy===

Many out-of-wedlock births are unintentional. Out-of-wedlock births are frequently not acceptable to society, and they often result in single parenting. A partner may also leave as he or she may want to shirk responsibility of bringing up the child. This also may harm the child. Where they are not acceptable, they sometimes result in forced marriage, however such marriages fail more often than others.

In the United States, the rate of unintended pregnancy is higher among unmarried couples than among married ones. In 1990, 73% of births to unmarried women were unintended at the time of conception, compared to about 57% of births overall (1987 data).

Mothers with unintended pregnancies, and their children, are subject to numerous adverse health effects, including increased risk of violence and death, and the children are less likely to succeed in school and are more likely to live in poverty and be involved in crime.

&quot;Fragile families&quot; are usually caused by an unintended pregnancy out of wedlock. Usually in this situation the father is not completely in the picture and the relationship between the mother, father, and child is consistently unstable. As well as instability, &quot;fragile families&quot; are often limited in resources such as human capital and money. The kids that come from these families are more likely to be hindered within school and don&#x27;t succeed as well as kids who have strictly single parents or two parent homes. Usually within these families the father plans to stick around and help raise the child but once the child is born the fathers do not stay for much longer and only one third stay after five years of the child&#x27;s birth. Most of these fragile families come from low economic status to begin with and the cycle appears to continue; once the child grows up they are just as likely to still be poor. Most fragile families end with the mother becoming a single parent, leaving it even more difficult to come out of the poverty cycle. The gender of the baby seems to have no effect if the father is not living with the mother at the time of the birth, meaning they are still likely to leave after one year of the child&#x27;s birth. Yet there is some evidence that suggests that if the father is living with the mother at the time of the birth he is more likely to stay after one year if the child is a son rather than a daughter.

===Choice===
Some women use artificial insemination to become single mothers by choice. Others choose to adopt. Men may also choose to become single fathers through adoption or surrogacy.

===Adoption===

Single parent adoptions are controversial. They are, however, still preferred over divorcees, as divorced parents are considered an unnecessary stress on the child. In one study, the interviewers asked children questions about their new lifestyle in a single-parent home. The interviewer found that when asked about fears, a high proportion of children feared illness or injury to the parent. When asked about happiness, half of the children talked about outings with their single adoptive parent. A single person wanting to adopt a child has to be mindful of the challenges they may face, and there are certain agencies that will not work with single adoptive parents at all. Single parents will typically only have their own income to live off of, and thus might not have a backup plan for potential children in case something happens to them. Traveling is also made more complex, as the child must either be left in someone else&#x27;s care, or taken along.

== By country ==
=== Australia ===
In 2003, 14% of all Australian households were single-parent families. In Australia 2011, out of all families 15.9% were single parent families. Out of these families 17.6% of the single parents were males, whilst 82.4% were females.

Single people are eligible to apply for adoption in all states of Australia, except for Queensland and South Australia. They are able to apply for adoption both to Australian born and international born children, although not many other countries allow single parent adoptions.

Single parents in Australia are eligible for support payments from the government, but only if they are caring for at least one child under the age of eight.

=== India ===
The Supreme Court of India and various High Courts of India have recognized the rights of single mothers to give birth and raise children. The High Court of Kerala, has declared in a case argued by Advocate Aruna A. that, the birth registration authorities cannot insist on the details of the father for registration of birth of a child born to a single mother, conceived through IVF. The Delhi High Court has held that &quot;mother’s name is sufficient in certain cases like the present one to apply for passport, especially as a single woman can be a natural guardian and also a parent&quot;. Considering these socio-legal transformations, a study suggested that despite facing numerous challenges, single mothers who are raising their children with little support from the families, society or state are challenging the dominant male breadwinner and provider model while redefining the heteronormative model of parenting.

===New Zealand===
At the 2013 census, 17.8% of New Zealand families were single-parent, of which five-sixths were headed by a female. Single-parent families in New Zealand have fewer children than two-parent families; 56% of single-parent families have only one child and 29% have two children, compared to 38% and 40% respectively for two-parent families.

=== Sierra Leone ===
In Sierra Leone, a 1994 study observed that it was socially acceptable for unmarried single Mende women to have children due to the social stigma of being a woman with no children.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, the number of single-parent households has risen in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries due to a variety of factors, including the HIV/AIDs epidemic, increasing economic migration within the country, and the social changes brought about by colonialism and apartheid. As of 2012, 39% of children living in South Africa lived with their biological mother and not their father, and 4% lived with their biological father but not their mother.
In South African academic literature, single mothers are studied as a part of the &quot;female headed household&quot; demographic. Colloquially, the term &quot;single-parent household&quot; or &quot;single mother&quot; is more widely used. The perception of single mothers within South African society varies depending on the cause of their situation. Women whose husbands died are not typically judged in the same way as divorced, separated, or unmarried women. Within South African media, the idea that unmarried women may seek to become pregnant in order to access child benefits is a common one. To avoid social stigma, the families of unmarried women with children will often raise the child(ren) as their own. It is especially common for the child to be raised as a sibling of their mother. However, this is not the case when the child has a disability. A 2023 study found that South African women who gave birth to children with disabilities were often rejected and left by their partners, their partner&#x27;s family, and their own family. This is due to stigma disabilities have carried in South African society and the blame placed upon the women for having a child with a disability.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, about 1 out of 4 families with dependent children are single-parent families, 8 to 11 percent of which have a male single-parent. UK poverty figures show that 52% of single parent families are below the Government-defined poverty line (after housing costs). Single parents in the UK are almost twice as likely to be in low-paid jobs as other workers (39% of working single parents compared with 21% of working people nationally). This is highlighted in a report published by Gingerbread, funded by Trust for London and Barrow Cadbury Trust.

===United States===

In the United States, since the 1960s, there has been a marked increase in the number of children living with a single parent. The jump was caused by an increase in births to unmarried women and by the increasing prevalence of divorces among couples. In 2010, 40.7% of births in the US were to unmarried women. In 2000, 11% of children were living with parents who had never been married, 15.6% of children lived with a divorced parent, and 1.2% lived with a parent who was widowed. The results of the 2010 United States Census showed that 27% of children live with one parent, consistent with the emerging trend noted in 2000. The most recent data of December 2011 shows approximately 13.7 million single parents in the U.S. 
Mississippi 
leads the nation with the highest percent of births to unmarried mothers with 54% in 2014, followed by Louisiana, New Mexico, Florida and South Carolina.

In 2006, 12.9 million families in the US were headed by a single parent, 80% of which were headed by a woman. Single-parent households are on average much poorer, a pattern largely explained by the lack of a second source of income in the home itself. 

According to a 2016 report from the United States Census Bureau, the percentage of children living in families with two parents decreased from 88 to 69 between 1960 and 2016. Of those 50.7 million children living in families with two parents, 47.7 million live with two married parents and 3.0 million live with two unmarried parents. The percentage of children living with single parents increased substantially in the United States during the second half of the 20th century. According to a 2013 Child Trends study, only 9% of children lived with single parents in the 1960s—a figure that increased to 28% in 2012. Single parent households became more common after legislation allowing no fault divorce.

=== Zimbabwe ===
Historically Zimbabwe has had a tradition of polygamy, and so a second or third wife might run a household and take care of their children as a lone parent. In contrast to Western societies, financial support for single parents (especially single mothers) typically comes from extended family support systems.

<text>Mohammed VI (; born 21 August 1963) is King of Morocco. A member of the Alawi dynasty, he acceded to the throne on 23 July 1999, upon the death of his father, King Hassan II. 

Mohammed has vast business holdings across several economic sectors in Morocco. His net worth has been estimated at between and over . In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; named him the richest king in Africa and the fifth wealthiest monarch in the world.

Upon ascending to the throne, Mohammed initially introduced several reforms and changed the family code to grant more rights to women in Morocco. Leaked diplomatic cables from WikiLeaks in 2010 led to allegations of corruption in the court of Mohammed, implicating him and his closest advisors. In 2011, protests in Morocco that were considered part of the wider Arab Spring occurred against alleged government corruption. In response, Mohammed enacted several reforms and introduced a new constitution. These reforms were passed by public referendum on 1 July 2011. In foreign policy, he prioritized relations with African countries and international recognition of Morocco&#x27;s claim to the territory of Western Sahara.

== Early life and education ==

Mohammed was born on 21 August 1963, as the second child and first son of King Hassan II and his wife, Lalla Latifa. As their eldest son, he was heir apparent from birth. 

Mohammed&#x27;s father was keen on giving him a religious and political education from an early age; at the age of four, he started attending the Quranic school at the Royal Palace. His educational routine commenced at 6 am with an hour-long recitation of the Quran, followed by formal lessons. He completed his first primary and secondary studies at the Collège Royal, a specialized college constructed within the fortified walls of the palace. Hassan  II, desiring his son to experience competitive pressure, selected 12 classmates recognized for their intellect to accompany Mohammed in his studies. As depicted in &quot;Le Roi prédateur&quot;, a 2012 biography authored by two French journalists, there is an account of Hassan instructing his aides to administer twenty lashes to Mohammed when he appeared to lag in his studies. 

According to a childhood friend, Mohammed harboured fantasies about the world beyond the palace walls and seldom ventured outside. One of his favourite songs was &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; by the English rock band Supertramp, which celebrates the allure of travel by jumbo jet. Mohammed excelled in languages.

Mohammed attained his Baccalaureate in 1981, before gaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law at the Mohammed V University at Agdal in 1985. His research paper dealt with &quot;the Arab-African Union and the Strategy of the Kingdom of Morocco in matters of International Relations&quot;. He was furthermore appointed president of the Pan Arab Games, and was commissioned a Brigadier General of the Royal Moroccan Army on 26 November 1985. Mohammed served as the Coordinator of the Offices and Services of the Royal Armed Forces until 1994.
In 1987, Mohammed obtained his first &quot;Certificat d&#x27;Études Supérieures&quot; (CES) in political sciences, and in July 1988 he obtained a &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Études Approfondies&quot; (DEA) in public law. In November 1988, he trained in Brussels with Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission.

According to a biography by Ferran Sales Aige, Mohammed&#x27;s father received reports from his spies indicating that the young prince was visiting bars regularly. This led to a deepening dissatisfaction from the king towards his son. In a moment of despair, Hassan II was rumoured to have described his son&#x27;s behaviour as a &quot;chromosome error.&quot; Mohammed was sent to study law in Nice, with his activities closely monitored by the interior minister dispatched by his father. He obtained his PhD in law with distinction on 29 October 1993 from the French University of Nice Sophia Antipolis for his thesis on &quot;EEC-Maghreb Relations&quot;. On 12 July 1994, he was promoted to the military rank of Major General, and that same year he became president of the High Council of Culture and Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Moroccan Army. 

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, before ascending to the throne, Mohammed &quot;gained a reputation as a playboy during the years he spent waiting in the wings, showing a fondness for fast cars and nightclubs.&quot; Over time, a noticeable estrangement developed between him and his father. He actively avoided encounters with Hassan II, even during his visits to Morocco. Instead, he frequently frequented Amnesia, an illicit club located underground in the capital city. According to &quot;Le Roi prédateur&quot;, Mohammed&#x27;s close friend from school, Fouad Ali El Himma, facilitated his visits to Amnesia by installing a private lift from his apartment above that descended directly to the club&#x27;s premises.

== Accession and early reign ==
Mohammed ascended the throne on the death of his father on 23 July 1999. He was formally enthroned one week later and made a televised address, promising to take on poverty and corruption, while creating jobs and improving Morocco&#x27;s human rights record. Islamist conservatives opposed his reformist rhetoric, and some of his reforms angered fundamentalists. His initial directives also included the dismissal of his father&#x27;s hardline interior minister, Driss Basri, and the appointment of some of his former classmates to key positions in the state bureaucracy.

Mohammed and his sister, Princess Lalla Meryem, made a state visit to the United States in June 2000, as guests of the president Bill Clinton. The Bush administration designated Morocco as a major non-NATO ally in 2004. The two countries later signed a free-trade agreement in 2006, the only one of its kind between the United States and an African country, which was met with some criticism within Morocco due to increasing trade deficit.

In February 2004, Mohammed enacted a new family code (Mudawana), which granted women more power. In July, he announced that Morocco would lift visa restrictions for Algerians, with Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika reciprocating the measure in 2005. Mohammed also created the Equity and Reconciliation Commission, which was tasked with researching human rights violations under Hassan II. This move was welcomed by many as promoting democracy but was also criticized because the commission&#x27;s reports did not name the perpetrators. According to human rights organizations, human rights violations are still common in Morocco.

In March 2006, the government created the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS), an advisory committee which defends Morocco&#x27;s claim to Western Sahara, and whose members are appointed by the king. The CORCAS proposed a plan for Western Sahara&#x27;s autonomy, provided it remains under Moroccan sovereignty. Mohammed went on to visit Western Sahara in 2006 and 2015.

== 2011 protests and constitutional reform ==

The 2011 Moroccan protests, led by the 20 February Movement, were primarily motivated by corruption and general political discontentment, as well as by the hardships of the global economic crisis. Then-recent revolutions influenced the demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt which overthrew their respective leaders, and demands by protesters included &quot;urgent&quot; political and social reforms, including the relinquishment of some of the King&#x27;s powers.

In a speech delivered on 9 March 2011, Mohammed said that parliament would receive &quot;new powers that enable it to discharge its representative, legislative, and regulatory mission&quot;. In addition, the powers of the judiciary were granted greater independence from the king, who announced that he was empanelling a committee of legal scholars to produce a draft constitution by June 2011. On 1 July, voters approved a set of political reforms proposed by the king in a referendum.

The reforms consisted of the following:
* Standard Moroccan Amazigh is designated an official national language, along with standard Arabic.
* The state preserves and protects the Hassaniya Arabic dialect and all the linguistic components of Moroccan culture as a heritage of the nation.
* The prime minister (officially titled &quot;head of government&quot;) presides over the Council of Government, which prepares the general policy of the state; previously the king held this position. The prime minister also has the power to dissolve the parliament.
* The king now must appoint the prime minister from the party that wins the most seats in the parliamentary elections, but it can be any member of the winning party and not necessarily the party&#x27;s leader. Previously, the king could nominate anybody he wanted for this position regardless of the election results. That was usually the case when no party had a big advantage over the other parties, in terms of the number of seats in the parliament.
* The king is no longer &quot;sacred or holy&quot; but the &quot;integrity of his person&quot; is &quot;inviolable&quot;.
* High administrative and diplomatic posts (including ambassadors, CEOs of state-owned companies, and provincial and regional governors) are now appointed by the prime minister and the ministerial council which is presided over by the king; previously the latter exclusively held this power.
* The parliament has the power to grant amnesty. Previously this was also exclusively held by the king.
* The king guarantees the independence of the judiciary system from the legislative and executive branches.
* Women are guaranteed &quot;civic and social&quot; equality with men. Previously, only &quot;political equality&quot; was guaranteed, though the 1996 constitution granted all citizens equality in terms of rights before the law.
* The king retains complete control over the armed forces and the judiciary as well as matters about religion and foreign policy, as well as the authority to appoint and dismiss prime ministers.
* In theory, all citizens have freedom of thought, ideas, artistic expression and creation. Previously only free speech and the freedom of circulation and association were guaranteed. However, criticizing or directly opposing the king is still punishable with prison.
== Later developments ==

=== Domestic and Western Sahara policy ===
In January 2017, Morocco banned the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of the burqa.

Beginning in late 2019, several countries which supported Morocco in the Western Sahara conflict established consulates in the Western Saharan cities of Laayoune and Dakhla, with a total of 28 as of 2023. In November 2020, an escalation of the ongoing Western Sahara conflict began when Sahrawi protesters blocked a road connecting Guerguerat to sub-Saharan Africa via Mauritania. Morocco responded by intervening militarily to resume the movement of people and goods through Guerguerat, which the Polisario Front said had violated the 1991 ceasefire agreement.

On 20 December 2022, Mohammed invited the Moroccan national football team to a reception at the Royal Palace in Rabat, following their reaching fourth place at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and awarded the members of the team with the Order of the Throne. In March 2023, he was invited by president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Patrice Motsepe to receive the CAF&#x27;s outstanding achievement award. During the awards ceremony in Kigali, Chakib Benmoussa, attending on behalf of the king, announced in a letter written by Mohammed that Morocco would join the Portugal–Spain 2030 FIFA World Cup bid as a co-host. The bid was unanimously approved by the FIFA Council in October.

In May 2023, Mohammed authorized the creation of a national public holiday for Yennayer (Berber New Year).

Following the September 2023 Al Haouz earthquake which killed nearly three thousand people, Mohammed visited hospitals to support victims and donated blood for the needy. Under his instructions, the royal holding Al Mada donated one billion dirhams for relief operations of quake-hit regions.

=== Foreign policy ===
In the latter part of his reign, Mohammed increasingly prioritized African relations in Morocco&#x27;s foreign policy. In July 2016, Mohammed addressed a letter to the 27th African Union (AU) summit in Kigali, in which he requested Moroccan admission to the organization. Morocco had previously been a member of the AU&#x27;s predecessor, the Organisation of African Unity, until it withdrew in 1984 in protest at the admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Mohammed justified his country&#x27;s withdrawal saying that &quot;the admission of a non-sovereign entity, by means of transgression and collusion&quot; had prompted Morocco to &quot;seek to avoid the division of Africa&quot;. Morocco was admitted to the African Union in January 2017.

Under his administration, Morocco developed partnerships with the Gulf Cooperation Council as well as other non-traditional great powers, mainly China and Russia, intending to diversify trade links and foreign investments and limit Morocco&#x27;s traditional reliance on the European Union and other Western countries. The country offered to act as a mediator in the Libyan crisis and remained neutral in the Qatar diplomatic crisis.

Morocco and Israel restored diplomatic relations on 10 December 2020, as part of the Israel–Morocco normalization agreement involving the United States, which at the same time recognized Morocco&#x27;s sovereignty over Western Sahara. In June 2021, Mohammed congratulated Naftali Bennett on his election as Israeli prime minister. On the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People in November 2021, the king announced that Morocco would continue to push for a restart of Israeli–Palestinian peace negotiations. He called on both sides &quot;to refrain from actions that obstruct the peace process&quot;.

In August 2022, Mohammed confirmed in a speech that the Western Sahara issue would form the basis for Morocco&#x27;s foreign policy, through which it &quot;measures the sincerity of friendships and the efficiency of partnerships&quot;. He called on other countries &quot;to clarify their positions&quot; on the conflict &quot;and reconsider them in a manner that leaves no room for doubt&quot;. In 2023, Israel under the third Netanyahu government became the second country to recognize Moroccan sovereignty over the territory, followed by Paraguay the following year.

Relations with neighbouring Algeria remained strained, despite calls from Mohammed for a reconciliation. Tensions intensified in the 2020s, primarily as a result of the Israel–Morocco normalization agreement and Western Saharan border clashes. In August 2021, Algeria accused Morocco of supporting the Movement for the Self-Determination of Kabylie, which it blamed for wildfires in northern Algeria, and later severed diplomatic relations with Morocco.

In February 2023, Mohammed and his foreign minister Nasser Bourita visited Gabon, meeting with its president Ali Bongo and conducting a donation of 2,000 tonnes of fertilizer to the country. On 4 December 2023, Mohammed and his entourage made an official visit to Dubai, at the invitation of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in which the two leaders signed a declaration committing to the development of &quot;deep-rooted&quot; bilateral relations.

== Business and wealth ==

Mohammed is Morocco&#x27;s leading businessman and banker. In 2015, he was estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine to be worth US$5.7bn although in 2019 &quot;Business Insider&quot; quoted a figure of just US$2.1 billion. The Moroccan Royal Family, meanwhile, has one of the largest fortunes in the world. Together, they hold the majority stakes in the Al Mada holding, formerly named the &quot;Société Nationale d&#x27;Investissement&quot; (SNI), which was originally state-owned but was merged in 2013 with Omnium Nord Africain (ONA Group), to form a single holding company that was taken off the Casablanca Stock Exchange—resulting in the scrapping of an equivalent of 50 billion dirhams marketcap (~US$6 billion). Al Mada has a diverse portfolio consisting of many important businesses in Morocco, operating in various sectors including: Attijariwafa Bank (banking), Managem (mining), Onapar, SOMED (tourism/real-estate and exclusive distributor of Maserati), Wafa Assurance (insurance), Marjane (hypermarket chain), Wana-Inwi (telecommunications), SONASID (siderurgy), Lafarge Maroc, Sopriam (exclusive distributor of Peugeot-Citroën in Morocco), Renault Maroc (exclusive distributor of Renault in Morocco) and Nareva (energy). It also owns many food-processing companies and is currently in the process of disengaging from this sector. Between mid-2012 and 2013, the holding sold &quot;Lessieur&quot;, &quot;Centrale Laitière&quot;, &quot;Bimo&quot; and &quot;Cosumar&quot; to foreign groups for a total amount of ~$1.37 billion (11.4 billion Dirhams including 9.7 billion in 2013 and 1.7 in 2012).
 SNI and ONA both owned stakes in Brasseries du Maroc, the largest alcoholic beverage manufacturer and distributor of brands such as Heineken in the country. In March 2018, the SNI adopted its current name, Al Mada.

Mohammed is also a leading agricultural producer and land owner in Morocco, where agriculture is exempted from taxes. His personal holding company SIGER has shares in the large agricultural group &quot;Les domaines agricoles&quot; (originally called &quot;Les domaines royaux&quot;, now commonly known as &quot;Les domaines&quot;), which was founded by Hassan II. In 2008, Telquel estimated that &quot;Les domaines&quot; had a revenue of $157 million (1.5 billion dirhams), with 170,000 tons of citrus exported in that year. According to the same magazine, the company officially owns 12,000 hectares of agricultural lands. &quot;Chergui&quot;, a manufacturer of dairy products, is the most recognizable brand of the group. Between 1994 and 2004, the group has been managed by Mohammed VI&#x27;s brother-in-law Khalid Benharbit, the husband of Princess Lalla Hasna. &quot;Les domaines&quot; also owns the Royal Golf de Marrakech, which originally belonged to Thami El Glaoui.

His palace&#x27;s daily operating budget is reported by Forbes to be $960,000, which is paid by the Moroccan state as part of a 2.576 billion dirhams/year budget as of 2014, with much of it accounted for by the expense of personnel, clothes, and car repairs.

== Controversies ==
=== Royal pardon scandal ===
Protests broke out in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, on 2 August 2013, after Mohammed pardoned 48 jailed Spaniards, including Daniel Galván, a pedophile who had been serving a 30-year sentence for raping 11 children aged between 4 and 15. Upon the protests, the King revoked Galván&#x27;s pardon and Morocco issued an international arrest warrant; Galván was arrested in Spain, where he continued his sentence.

Those pardoned included a drug trafficking suspect, who was released before standing trial. The detainee, Antonio Garcia, a recidivist drug trafficker, had been arrested in possession of 9 tons of hashish in Tangier and was sentenced to 10 years. He had resisted arrest using a firearm. Some media claimed that his release embarrassed Spain.

=== Allegations of corruption ===
Royal involvement in business is a major topic in Morocco, but public discussion of it is sensitive. The US embassy in Rabat reported to Washington in a leaked cable that &quot;corruption is prevalent at all levels of Moroccan society&quot;. Corruption allegedly reaches the highest levels in Morocco, where the business interests of Mohammed VI and some of his advisors influence &quot;every large housing project,&quot; according to WikiLeaks documents published in December 2010 and quoted in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. The documents released by the whistleblower website also quote the case of a businessman working for a US consortium, whose plans in Morocco were paralysed for months after he refused to join forces with a company linked with the royal palace. The documents quoted a company executive linked to the royal family as saying at a meeting that decisions on big investments in the kingdom were taken by only three people: the king, his secretary Mounir Majidi, and the monarch&#x27;s close friend, adviser and former classmate Fouad Ali El Himma. This corruption especially affects the housing sector, the WikiLeaks documents show.

In April 2016, Mohammed&#x27;s personal secretary, Mounir Majidi, was named in the Panama Papers.

== Family and personal life ==
Mohammed has three sisters: Princess Lalla Meryem, Princess Lalla Asma, and Princess Lalla Hasna and one brother, Prince Moulay Rachid. The &quot;New York Times&quot; noted &quot;conflicting reports about whether the new monarch had been married on Friday night, within hours of his father&#x27;s death [in 1999]... to heed a Moroccan tradition that a King be married before he ascends the throne.&quot; A palace official subsequently denied that a marriage had taken place.

His engagement to Salma Bennani was announced on 12 October 2001. They married in private in Rabat on 21 March 2002, and their wedding was celebrated at the Dar al-Makhzen in Rabat on 12 and 13 July 2002. Bennani became princess consort with the style of Her Royal Highness on her marriage. They had two children: Crown Prince &quot;Moulay&quot; Hassan (born 8 May 2003) and Princess Lalla Khadija (born 28 February 2007). The couple&#x27;s divorce was announced on 21 March 2018.

Mohammed&#x27;s birthday on 21 August is a public holiday, although festivities were cancelled upon the death of his aunt in 2014.

In 2020, Mohammed purchased an €80 million mansion in Paris from the Saudi royal family.

=== Health ===
Mohammed&#x27;s health has been a recurring topic both within and outside Morocco.

In 2017, he underwent a successful surgery at the Quinze-Vingts National Ophthalmology Hospital in Paris to remove a pterygium in his left eye. In February 2018, he underwent a radiofrequency ablation to normalize an irregular heart rate, and was visited by members of the royal family. In September 2019, the King was advised to rest for several days to recover from acute viral pneumonia, while his son Crown Prince Moulay Hassan represented him at former French President Jacques Chirac&#x27;s funeral. In June 2020, he underwent a procedure in Rabat to treat a recurrence of atrial flutter.

In June 2022, Mohammed tested positive for COVID-19. His personal doctor said he did not exhibit symptoms and recommended &quot;a period of rest for a few days&quot;. &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; reported that he contracted the disease while on a private visit to France. On 10 July 2022, he made his first public appearance since recovering from COVID-19 when he performed Eid al-Adha rituals and prayers. In December 2024 he underwent surgery after fracturing his left shoulder in a fall.

<text>The London Psychogeographical Association (LPA), sometimes referred to as the London Psychogeographical Committee, is an organisation devoted to psychogeography. The LPA is perhaps best understood in the context of psychogeographical praxis.

==London Psychogeographical Institute==
The LPA was first mentioned in 1957 by the British artist Ralph Rumney, as one of the organisers of the &quot;First Exhibition of Psychogeography&quot; in Brussels, which included his work. According to many accounts the group eventually merged into the Situationist International. Rumney was in fact the only member of the &#x27;Association&#x27;.

==LPA East London Section==
In the 1990s, the LPA was reinvoked as the LPA East London Section by Fabian Tompsett, using the pseudonym Richard Essex, who published a series of newsletters and pamphlets under its name, as well as the writers grouped around the multiple user name Luther Blissett, including Stewart Home. Activities of the ELS also included trips to destinations of psychogeographical interest and the organisation of three sided football matches.

This version of the LPA has been described by the writer Iain Sinclair, whose work is often described as psychogeographical, as useful in &quot;branding&quot; that kind of practice.

In 1994 Barry Hugill wrote an article for &quot;The Observer&quot; covering the LPA. He depicted their ideas as &quot;so cranky that to mention Mr Ackroyd&#x27;s name in the same breath is to invite a writ.&quot; However he also states that &quot;the psychogeographers fear that in 2000 there may be an attempt to perpetuate patriarchy through the ritual murder of a top member of royalty.&quot;

The work of Luther Blissett, Stewart Home and other psychogeographical groups is said to involve the issuing of numerous leaflets and letters under a series of aliases, both personal and organisational, and the description of interactions, including collaborations and feuds, between both these and other, real people and groups (for example between Luther Blissett and the parapolitical researcher Larry O&#x27;Hara).

The last LPA Newsletter was issued around the year 2000.

<doc id="226116" wikidata="Q1902474" url="?curid=226116" title="Marquess of Queensberry">
<text>Marquess of Queensberry is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. The title has been held since its creation in 1682 by a member of the Douglas family. The Marquesses also held the title of Duke of Queensberry from 1684 to 1810, when it was inherited by the Duke of Buccleuch.

==History==
The feudal barony of Drumlanrig was held by Sir William Douglas, illegitimate son of the 2nd Earl of Douglas and Mar, some time before 1427, when he died. His descendant William Douglas, 9th of Drumlanrig, was created the 1st Earl of Queensberry in 1633.

The subsidiary titles of Lord Queensberry are: Earl of Queensberry (created 1633), Viscount Drumlanrig (1628) and Lord Douglas of Hawick and Tibbers (1628), all in the peerage of Scotland. He is also a Scottish baronet, styled &quot;of Kelhead&quot;, created 26 February 1668, so the 6th Marquess was the 5th Baronet. The courtesy title used by Lord Queensberry&#x27;s eldest son and heir is &quot;Viscount Drumlanrig&quot;. There is no special courtesy title for Lord Drumlanrig&#x27;s eldest son and heir.

The family seat of the Marquesses of Queensberry was Kinmount House in the parish of Cummertrees, south Scotland, which was sold by the 9th Marquess in 1896. The traditional burial place of the Marquesses of Queensberry is the Douglas family mausoleum at Cummertrees Parish Church.

The 9th Marquess is particularly well known because of the rules of boxing that were named after him (the &quot;Marquess of Queensberry&quot; rules), and for his litigious interaction with Oscar Wilde.

On 22 June 1893, Queen Victoria raised Francis Archibald, Viscount Drumlanrig, the heir of the 9th Marquess, to the peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Kelhead. Francis, Lord Drumlanrig, died without descendants the following year and the title &quot;Baron Kelhead&quot; became extinct.

==Lairds of Drumlanrig==
*William Douglas, 1st of Drumlanrig (died 1427)
*William Douglas, 2nd of Drumlanrig (died 1458)
*William Douglas, 3rd of Drumlanrig (died 1464)
*William Douglas, 4th of Drumlanrig (died 1484)
*James Douglas, 5th of Drumlanrig (died 1498)

*James Douglas, 8th of Drumlanrig (died 1615)
*William Douglas, 9th of Drumlanrig, 1st Earl of Queensberry (died 1640) (became Earl of Queensberry in 1633)

==Earls of Queensberry (1633)==
*William Douglas, 1st Earl of Queensberry (died 8 March 1639/40)
*James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Queensberry (died 1671)
*William Douglas, 3rd Earl of Queensberry (1637–1695) (became Marquess of Queensberry in 1682, and Duke of Queensberry in 1684)

==Marquesses (1682) and Dukes of Queensberry (1684)==

*William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry (1637–1695)
*James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry (1672–1711) (became Duke of Dover in 1708)

*William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry, 5th Marquess of Queensberry (1725–1810)

The 2nd Duke of Queensberry surrendered all of his titles except the Marquessate and its subsidiary titles to the Crown and obtained a new grant under the same precedence (1684) with remainder to the Dukedom and those subsidiary titles bypassing his second son to his third son and further to the heirs male and female of the 1st Earl of Queensberry. Upon his death the Marquessate passed to James Douglas, 3rd Marquess and a homicidal maniac known as &quot;the Cannibalistic Idiot.&quot; He was excluded from his father&#x27;s titles after the duke&#x27;s death, which instead passed to Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke. The 3rd Duke also succeeded as Marquess upon the latter&#x27;s death at age 17.

The Dukedom of Queensberry passed by special remainder to the heirs male or female of the 1st Earl of Queensberry who was Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, son of Francis Scott, Earl of Dalkeith through Lady Jean Douglas (married to Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch) who was eldest daughter surviving infancy of the 2nd Duke of Queensberry.

*Francis Archibald Kelhead Douglas, 11th Marquess of Queensberry (1896–1954)

<doc id="226119" wikidata="Q285869" url="?curid=226119" title="De Havilland Hornet">
<text>The de Havilland DH.103 Hornet, developed by de Havilland, is a fighter aircraft driven by two piston engines. It further exploited the wooden construction techniques that had been pioneered by the de Havilland Mosquito. Development of the Hornet had started during the Second World War as a private venture. The aircraft was to conduct long range fighter operations in the Pacific Theatre against the Empire of Japan but the war ended before the Hornet reached operational squadron status.

The Hornet entered service with RAF Fighter Command where it equipped several day fighter units and was commonly stationed in the British mainland. It saw combat in the Far East, being used as a strike fighter as part of the British military action taken during the Malayan Emergency. A naval carrier-capable version, the Sea Hornet, had been envisaged early on and was procured by the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy.

==Development==
===Origins===
In the autumn of 1941, de Havilland found that it had the spare design capacity to work on a new project. At this point, the Mosquito had entered full-rate production and preliminary work on a jet-propelled fighter aircraft, which became the Vampire, was waiting for the production of prototype engines. The company promptly recognised a need for a high-speed, unarmed, night bomber powered by a pair of large Napier Sabre piston engines and a design for such an aircraft was first proposed under the designation &quot;D.H. 101&quot; in October 1941. A design team led by R. E. Bishop with C. T. Wilkins assisting, was assembled with the aim of developing the D.H. 101, which was initially pursued as a private venture.

The Sabre engine was suffering from availability problems at that point and the DH. 101 was soon replaced by a lower-powered design, with the internal designation &quot;D.H. 102&quot;. This proposal was intended to be powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Griffon or Rolls-Royce Merlin engines but either engine would have meant that the aircraft would be somewhat slower and less attractive than the Mosquito.

By November 1942, de Havilland had elected to shelve the night bomber project and concentrate on producing a long-range fighter, the &quot;D.H. 103&quot;, that would make the maximum possible use of the Merlin engine. The D.H. 103 resembled a small Mosquito, with a single seat; it was intended to take on other single-seat fighter aircraft, particularly those operated by Japan, while still being capable of conducting very long range missions to be of use in the Pacific Theatre. The long range requirement led to the fuselage being highly streamlined. An independently developed version of the Merlin engine which possessed a low frontal area was selected for use on the D.H. 103.

By the end of 1942, a mock-up of the D.H. 103 had been completed at de Havilland&#x27;s Hatfield facility and was soon afterwards demonstrated to officials of the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Due to the war, the ministry did not immediately issue permission to construct the D.H. 103. In June 1943, the project stopped being a private venture when the Ministry released Specification F.12/43, which had been written around the D.H. 103 proposal; soon after, the D.H. 103 project received the name Hornet.

It was envisaged that the Hornet could be adapted for naval use and operated from the flight decks of aircraft carriers. Priority was given early on to ensuring that such adaptation could be readily done: measures for ease of control, especially when flown at low speeds, were incorporated and attention paid to providing the pilot with a high level of visibility. The two propellers were driven in opposite directions to improve take-off and landing characteristics and high-drag flaps were integrated to provide for greater power during approaches.

===Prototypes and refinement===

By January 1944, the fuselage shell for the first prototype D.H. 103, &quot;RR915&quot;, was under construction on production jigs at Hatfield; &quot;RR915&quot; was rolled out for engine runs on 20 July 1944. On 28 July 1944, only thirteen months after the official sanction to proceed with development, &quot;RR915&quot; conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., the company&#x27;s chief test pilot. Flight tests of &quot;RR915&quot; led to it achieving a recorded speed of 485 mph (780 km/h) in level flight. Within two months, over fifty flight hours were accumulated by &quot;RR915&quot;. The second prototype, &quot;RR919&quot;, was more representative of production aircraft, having provision for a pair of 200-gallon drop tanks and a pair of 1,000 lbs bombs on hard points underneath the wings.

Towards the end of 1944, the assembly line for the Hornet F.1, the initial production model, was being established at Hatfield and orders had already been received for the Royal Air Force (RAF). On 28 February 1945, &quot;PX210&quot;, the first of 60 production F.1 aircraft was delivered to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) at RAF Boscombe Down. On 29 October 1945, a production Hornet F.1, &quot;PX237&quot;, was used for the type&#x27;s first public appearance at an open day at RAE Farnborough.

Additional prototypes were used for the development of improved variants of the Hornet. &quot;PX312&quot;, participated in the development of an improved fighter model to succeed the F.1, the Hornet F.3. &quot;PX212&quot;, &quot;PX214&quot;, and &quot;PX219&quot;, were converted by the Heston Aircraft Company from Hornet F.1 standard aircraft to represent and test aspects of the initial naval version, later named &quot;Sea Hornet F.20&quot;. &quot;PX212&quot; and &quot;PX214&quot; were only partially naval, being outfitted with arrestor hooks but lacking the wing-folding mechanisms of subsequent production aircraft; &quot;PX219&quot; was the full naval version and later conducted carrier deck trials on board the aircraft carrier .

&quot;PX230&quot; and &quot;PX239&quot;, were completed for an all-weather night fighter, the Hornet NF.21. &quot;PX239&quot;, originally built as a Hornet F.20, was outfitted with power-operated folding wings and a large dorsal fillet, which was later fitted to all production aircraft to comply with a new requirement to provide &quot;feet off&quot; directional stability with one engine stopped. On 25 October 1948, the first deck trials commenced on board ; these were so successful that testing rapidly proceeded to the night trials phase. On 16 May 1947, &quot;PX230&quot; was lost during service trials when the aircraft disintegrated in mid flight; the pilot bailed out following the breakup of the aircraft.

===Hornet F.3, PR.2 and FR.4===
The wings of the Hornet F.3 were stressed to carry external weapons; two to four 60 lb (27 kg) RP-3 rockets could be carried under each wing; it was also possible to carry a combination of four rockets with one bomb of up to 1,000 lb (454 kg), or an additional drop tank on each wing, ranging in capacity up to 200 Imp gal (909 L). Internally, the fuel tanks were enlarged from a total capacity of 360 Imp gal (1,636 L) to 432 Imp gal (1,964 L) and additional equipment was added. Larger horizontal tail surfaces were adopted, with larger elevator horn balances. With the evolution of longer-range, jet-powered fighters such as the de Havilland Vampire, de Havilland Venom and Gloster Meteor, the Hornet became obsolete fairly quickly. The F.3 was the last Hornet derivative to see operational RAF service.

The Hornet PR.2 was intended to operate as a long-range photo-reconnaissance aircraft. The Hispano cannon were removed and cameras were mounted in the rear fuselage. Total internal fuel capacity was increased to 528 gal (2,400 L). &quot;PX216&quot;, &quot;PX220&quot; and &quot;PX249&quot;, were converted from standard Hornet F.1 aircraft, later followed by five more. The requirement for these aircraft lapsed with the end of the Second World War in the Pacific; all were used in arrester barrier trials at Boscombe Down and scrapped before entering RAF service. Twelve Hornet FR.4s were modified from F.3s in much the same way, except that the cannon were retained and the internal fuel capacity slightly reduced from that of the fighter. These FR.4 derivatives saw service with the RAF in Malaya and Hong Kong in the early 1950s.

===Sea Hornet F.20, NF.21 and PR.22===
The Hornet was designed with the possibility of naval service on carriers firmly in mind. To this end good low-speed handling was required, along with good all-round visibility for the pilot. The basic Hornet design excelled at meeting these requirements. Shortly after the first Hornet prototype flew, Specification N.5/44 was issued to de Havilland, covering the modification of the Hornet for naval service. The Heston Aircraft Company was contracted to carry out the conversion work on three early production F.1s. The work entailed altering the wings to incorporate folding mechanisms so that each outer wing panel, from the aileron/flap line outboard could be folded upwards and inwards at an angle. The hinges were part of the upper wing skin structure while the lower wing skins incorporated securing latches, and Lockheed hydraulic jacks were used to move the wing panels. Slotted flaps were introduced to improve low speed &quot;flaps down&quot; control.
The lower rear fuselage was reinforced with two additional spruce longerons designed to take the stresses imposed by the external &quot;vee&quot; framed arrestor hook, which was flush-mounted below the fuselage. The frame was made up of steel tubing with a forged-steel hook and was held against the fuselage by a &quot;snap gear&quot;. Because the Hornet used the American &quot;3-point&quot; system of catapult-assisted takeoff, two forged steel catapult bridle hooks were fitted, one below each wing, close to the fuselage. The de Havilland rubber-in-compression undercarriage legs could not absorb the rebound energies imposed by carrier landings. They were replaced by more conventional hydraulic oleos which embodied torque links.

Merlin 133/134s (derated from to ) were fitted to all Sea Hornets. Other specialised naval equipment (mainly different radio gear) was fitted and provision was made for three camera ports, one on each side of the rear fuselage and one pointing down. Sea Hornet F.20s also incorporated the modifications of the Hornet F.3, although the internal fuel capacity was 347 Imp gal (1,557 L), slightly reduced from that of the F.1. The modifications added some 550 lb (249 kg) to the weight of the aircraft. Maximum speed was decreased by 11 mph (18 km/h).

The Hornet NF.21 was designed to fill a need for a naval night fighter. Special flame-dampening exhausts were installed, and a second basic cockpit was added to the rear fuselage, just above the wing trailing edges. ASH radar equipment was placed in the rear of this cockpit, with the radar operator/navigator seated facing aft. To gain access, a small trapdoor was provided in the lower fuselage; a fixed, teardrop-shaped bubble canopy, which could be jettisoned in an emergency, provided a good field of view. At the front of the aircraft, the nose underwent a transformation with the small rotating ASH radar dish being housed under an elongated &quot;thimble&quot; radome. The horizontal tail units were increased in span. The effect of these modifications on performance was minimal; about 4 mph (6 km/h).

The Sea Hornet PR.22 was a dedicated photo reconnaissance aircraft version of the F.20. The cannon were removed and the apertures faired over. Three cameras were installed in the rear fuselage: two F.52s for night use and one K.19B for day. A total of 23 PR.22s were built, interspersed with F.20s being built at Hatfield.

===Civilian Hornet===
The lone civilian Hornet, and the only one to be owned by a non-British operator, was a Sea Hornet F.20 &quot;TT193&quot;. It had originally been dispatched to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada to conduct winter trials; following these tests, &quot;TT193&quot; was sold rather than be transported back to England. Registered &quot;CF-GUO&quot;, the aircraft was operated by Spartan Air Services and Kenting Aviation until 11 July 1952 when an engine failure caused a forced landing at Terrace, British Columbia. After being reduced to components &quot;TT193&quot; is to be restored to fly by Pioneer Aero Ltd at Ardmore, New Zealand.

===Flying the Sea Hornet===
Captain Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown, former fighter pilot and officer of the Fleet Air Arm, was one of the world&#x27;s most accomplished test pilots and he held the record for flying the greatest number of aircraft types.

Just after VE Day the first semi-naval Sea Hornet &quot;PX 212&quot; arrived at the RAE, Farnborough. Eric Brown initiated &quot;work-up to deck-landing&quot; trials. 37 years later, he was still impressed:

:&quot;...the next two months of handling and deck landing assessment trials were to be an absolute joy; from the outset the Sea Hornet was a winner!&quot;
:&quot;The view from the cockpit, positioned right forward in the nose beneath a one-piece aft-sliding canopy was truly magnificent. The Sea Hornet was easy to taxi, with powerful brakes... the takeoff using 25 lb (2,053 mm Hg, 51&quot; Hg) boost and flaps at one-third extension was remarkable! The Merlin 130/131 engines fitted to the prototypes were to be derated to 18 lb (1,691 Hg, 37&quot; Hg) boost and as Merlin 133/134s in production Sea Hornets, but takeoff performance was to remain fantastic. Climb with 18 lb boost exceeded &quot;...
&quot;In level flight the Sea Hornet&#x27;s stability about all axes was just satisfactory, characteristic, of course, of a good day interceptor fighter. Its stalling characteristics were innocuous, with a fair amount of elevator buffeting and aileron twitching preceding the actual stall&quot;...
:&quot;For aerobatics the Sea Hornet was absolute bliss. The excess of power was such that manoeuvres in the vertical plane can only be described as rocket-like. Even with one propeller feathered the Hornet could loop with the best single-engine fighter, and its aerodynamic cleanliness was such that I delighted in its demonstration by diving with both engines at full bore and feathering both propellers before pulling up into a loop!&quot;

During this series of tests Captain Brown found that the ailerons were too heavy and ineffectual for deck landing and there were some problems with throttle movement, brakes and the rubber-in-compression undercarriage legs were still fitted. De Havilland were quick to modify the aircraft. Eric Brown:
:&quot;Landings aboard had been made without any crash barrier... Yet, in the case of the Sea Hornet, I had felt such absolute confidence that I was mentally relaxed... Indeed, there was something about the Sea Hornet that made me feel that I had total mastery of it; I revelled in its sleek form and the immense surge of power always to hand...&quot;
:&quot;Circumstances had conspired against the Sea Hornet in obtaining the recognition that it justly deserved as a truly outstanding warplane...in my book the Sea Hornet ranks second to none for harmony of control, performance characteristics and, perhaps most important, in inspiring confidence in its pilot. For sheer exhilarating flying enjoyment, no aircraft has ever made a deeper impression on me than did this outstanding filly from the de Havilland stable.&quot;

==Design==

The de Havilland Hornet bore a family resemblance to the larger Mosquito, but it was an entirely fresh design albeit one that drew extensively upon experiences from, and the design of, the Mosquito. It was powered by a pair of highly developed Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, producing each, which drove de Havilland Propellers four-bladed propellers. According to aviation author P.J. Birtles, the efficiency and power of this configuration gave the Hornet &quot;a higher performance than any other propeller driven aircraft&quot;. The Hornet&#x27;s principal armament was four short-barrelled 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano V cannons, while other typical weapon loads included various rockets and bombs.

Fuselage construction was identical to the earlier Mosquito: a balsa wood &quot;pith&quot; sandwiched between plywood sheets which were laid in diagonal panels. Aerolite formaldehyde cement was the bonding agent. The fuselage halves were built on large concrete or wood patterns and equipment was fitted in each half; they were then joined along the top and bottom centre lines using wooden reinforcing strips. The entire fuselage was then tightly wrapped in fine aviation fabric which was doped in place. The tailfin which had the trademark gracefully-curved de Havilland shape, was an integral part of the rear fuselage. On late F.1s and further models of production aircraft, a fin fillet was added to the base of the unit. The horizontal tail unit was an all-metal structure, again featuring the distinctive de Havilland shape, which was later repeated on the Chipmunk and Beaver.

Construction was of mixed balsa/plywood similar to the Mosquito but the Hornet differed in incorporating stressed Alclad lower-wing skins bonded to the wooden upper wing structure using the new adhesive Redux. The two wing spars were redesigned to withstand a higher load factor of 10 versus 8. Apart from the revised structure, the Hornet&#x27;s wings were a synthesis of aerodynamic knowledge that had been gathered since the design of the Mosquito, being much thinner in cross-section, and with a laminar flow profile similar to the P-51 Mustang and Hawker Tempest. The control surfaces consisted of hydraulically-operated split flaps extending from the wing root to outboard of the engine nacelles; as on the Mosquito, the rear of the nacelle was part of the flap structure. Outboard, the Alclad-covered ailerons extended close to the clipped wing tips and gave excellent roll control.
The Hornet used &quot;slimline&quot; Merlin engines of types 130 and 131, which had engine ancillaries repositioned to minimise frontal area and drag. It was unusual for a British design in having propellers that rotated in opposite directions; the two engine crankshafts rotated in the same direction but the Merlin 131 added an idler gear to reverse its propeller&#x27;s rotation (to clockwise, viewed from the front). This cancelled the torque effect of two propellers turning in the same direction that had affected earlier designs (such as the Mosquito). It also reduced adverse yaw caused by aileron trim corrections and generally provided more stable and predictable behaviour in flight. De Havilland tried propellers that rotated outward at the tops of their arcs (as in the P-38 Lightning), but this configuration blanketed the fin and reduced rudder effectiveness at low speeds, compromising ground handling. On production Hornets the conventionally rotating Merlin 130 was on the port wing with the Merlin 131 on the starboard.

Because of the revised induction arrangements of the Merlin 130 series, the supercharger and carburettor air intakes could be placed in the leading edges of the wings, outboard of the nacelles. (Other versions of the Merlin, which used &quot;updraft&quot; induction arrangements, required that the intakes be placed in a duct below the main engine cowling). The main radiators were also mounted in the inboard leading edges of the wings. Internal fuel, to a maximum capacity of 432 Imp gal (1,964 L) (F.3) was stored in four self-sealing wing tanks, which were reached through detachable panels forming part of the lower wing surfaces. To assist airflow over the wing, the engine nacelles were mounted low, which meant that the undercarriage legs were reasonably short and the pilot&#x27;s field of view was improved. The single-legged undercarriage units were simpler and cleaner than those of the Mosquito, using the same de Havilland-developed, rubber-in-compression energy absorption system. The main wheels were also smaller and lighter.

To further aid the pilot&#x27;s field of view, the unpressurised cockpit was mounted well forward in the fuselage and was housed under an aft-sliding perspex blister canopy. The three-panel windscreen was designed so that refraction through the panels meant that there were no obvious blind spots caused by the corner tie-rods; all three panels were bullet-proof laminated glass. An armour-plated bulkhead (hinged near the top to provide access to the back of the instrument panel and the rudder pedals), was part of the nose structure, with the pilot&#x27;s back and head being protected by another armoured bulkhead built into the cockpit. Below and behind the cockpit floor was a bay housing the aircraft&#x27;s principal armament of four 20 mm cannon, which had a maximum of 190 rounds per cannon which fired through short blast tubes. The Sea Hornet had a similar armament to its land-based counterparts.

==Operational history==

===Hornet===

In mid-1946, the Hornet entered squadron service with 64 Squadron, based at RAF Horsham St Faith. Next to convert to the Hornet was 19 Squadron at RAF Wittering, followed by 41 Squadron and 65 Squadron, both based at RAF Church Fenton. No. 65 Sqn participated in one of the first official overseas visits by an RAF unit when they visited Sweden in May 1948. Pilot conversion to the Hornet was provided by No. 226 Operational Conversion Unit (O.C.U.) which was based at RAF Molesworth.

During their relatively short operational service, Hornets participated in several record attempts and air races; for example, on 15 September 1949 Flight Lieutenant H. Peebles flew from RAF Bovingdon to Gibraltar (1,100+ mi or 1,800+ km) at an average speed of 357.565 mph (574.445 km/h), setting a new British point-to-point record. Peebles&#x27; record stood for only three days, being broken when the same Hornet, flown by Group Captain A.P.C. Carver, returned to Bovingdon, averaging 435.871 mph (701.466 km/h). On 31 August 1946, Geoffrey Pike attained third place in &quot;PX224&quot; in the Lympne High Speed Handicap race, having flown a recorded average speed of . On 30 July 1949, &quot;PX286&quot; participated in the National Air Races (GB) at Elmdon; when flown by Geoffrey Pike, it clocked the fastest lap at and attained second place overall.

Operationally, the Hornet I (later re-designated as the F.1) lasted only a short time before being superseded by the improved F.3 version. The first Hornet F.3 was &quot;PX 366&quot;, which flew at the Farnborough Air Show in June 1946. New units to convert to this mark were 33 Squadron, 45 Squadron (based at RAF Tengah, Singapore where, in early 1952, the unit converted to the Hornet from the unreliable Bristol Brigand) and 80 Squadron.

In 1951, considerable numbers of Hornets were redeployed from Fighter Command to the squadrons of the Far East Air Force (FEAF). Along with 45 Sqn, 33 and 80 Squadrons participated in combat operations during the Malayan Emergency. Upon arrival, the Hornets were promptly used to replace Bristol Beaufighters and Supermarine Spitfires that were being operated in support of ground security forces against Communist guerrillas fighting in the region. Armed with rockets and/or 1,000 lb (454 kg) bombs, the Hornets, with their long range and good endurance, were able to spend up to two hours loitering over a given target area, which was particularly useful because target identification often proved to be challenging and time consuming.

The Hornets were often sortied in conjunction with strikes from Avro Lincoln bombers. Other activities included the aerial escorting of ground convoys. The Hornet proved to be very reliable: 45 Sqn Hornets, based in Singapore, achieved a total of 4,500 operational sorties over five years, more than any other squadron in the FEAF.

On 23 July 1954, two Hornets from RAF Kai Tak in Hong Kong were the first to arrive on the scene of a shootdown of a Cathay Pacific Skymaster off the coast of Hainan Island. On 21 May 1955, the last operational Hornet sortie was flown; by mid-1956, all Hornets had been recorded as having been withdrawn from operational service. No complete examples of the Hornet remain in existence today.

===Sea Hornet===

On 1 June 1947, 801 Squadron was reformed to become the first squadron to operate the Sea Hornet, based at RNAS Ford. After relocating to Arbroath, the squadron participated in numerous trials for the type prior to the Sea Hornet&#x27;s first seaborne deployment, having embarked upon in 1949. In 1951, a further transfer was made to : during their time on board the Sea Hornets contributed to a multinational maritime exercises as long-range fighter escort and strike aircraft; however, in June 1951, they were replaced by single-engined Hawker Sea Furies.

Further Sea Hornet deliveries were attached to various Naval Squadrons, including three which were attached to 806 Squadron in 1948 which, along with a Vampire and two Sea Furies, were embarked on HMCS &quot;Magnificent&quot; for a tour of North America in 1948. During the North American tour, multiple Sea Hornets performed several spectacular flying displays at the International Air Exposition in New York City between 31 July and 8 August. In mid-1948, one Sea Hornet, PX219, was adapted to carry a pair of Highball bouncing bombs in an installation that was developed, but not applied to the fleet. The equipment was removed during January 1949 and it is currently unknown if the Hornet ever dropped a Highball during flight.

On 20 January 1949, 809 Squadron became the first squadron to be equipped with the Sea Hornet NF 21, having been reformed specifically to operate the type, based at RNAS Culdrose. 809 Squadron was the only front-line unit to use this variant; following an initial workup period, the squadron briefly transferred to HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; for deck landing practice. In May 1951, the NF.21s of 809 Squadron relocated to to form a portion of the FAA&#x27;s first all-weather air group.

On 16 October 1951, a formation of four NF.21 aircraft flew non-stop from Gibraltar to Lee-on-the-Solent, Hampshire, England, in 3 hours 10 minutes at an average speed of just under 330 mph; on 24 November 1951, a single Sea Hornet flew the same route in 2 hours 45 minutes at an average speed of 378 mph. During a brief deployment in 1952, it was quickly determined that the Sea Hornet was not suitable for use on board the Navy&#x27;s light fleet carriers. 809 Squadron was briefly seconded to the RAF at Coltishall prior to being deployed to Hal Far, Malta; it was on Malta that the Squadron was disbanded in 1954 to be reequipped with the jet-powered de Havilland Sea Venom.

The NF.21 later equipped the Fleet Requirements Units at Hal Far, Malta, and St Davids, West Wales. One Sea Hornet F.20, &quot;TT 213&quot;, was acquired by the RAAF from the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom. The aircraft was used by the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU), at Laverton, Victoria, Australia from 1948 to 1950. It was mainly used for evaluation and tropical trials. Through 1956 and 1957, the majority of the retired Hornets were scrapped, having deteriorated badly due to the weather during storage.

<doc id="226121" wikidata="Q622568" url="?curid=226121" title="Secretary of State for War">
<text>The secretary of state for war, commonly called the war secretary, was a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, which existed from 1794 to 1801 and from 1854 to 1964. The secretary of state for war headed the War Office and was assisted by a parliamentary under-secretary of state for war, a parliamentary private secretary who was also a member of parliament (MP), and a military Secretary, who was a general.

==History==
The position of &quot;secretary of state for war&quot; was first held by Henry Dundas who was appointed in 1794. In 1801, the post became that of secretary of state for war and the colonies. The position of secretary of state for war was re-instated in 1854 when the secretary of state for the colonies was created as a separate position.

In the nineteenth century, the post was twice held by future prime minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman. At the outset of the First World War, prime minister H. H. Asquith was filling the role, but he quickly appointed Lord Kitchener, who became famous while in this position for Lord Kitchener Wants You. He was replaced by David Lloyd George, who went on to become prime minister. Between the World Wars, the post was held by future prime minister Winston Churchill for two years. 

In 1946, the three posts of secretary of state for war, first lord of the admiralty, and secretary of state for air became formally subordinated to that of minister of defence, which had itself been created in 1940 for the co-ordination of defence and security issues.

In the 1960s, John Profumo held this post at the time of the Profumo affair.

On 1 April 1964, with the creation of a new united Ministry of Defence headed by the secretary of state for defence, the three service ministries as well as the post of minister of defence as created in 1940 were abolished.

<doc id="226125" wikidata="Q238344" url="?curid=226125" title="Legalism (Chinese philosophy)">
<text>Fajia (), or the School of &quot;fa&quot; (laws, methods), often translated as Legalism, is a school of mainly Warring States period classical Chinese philosophy. Often interpreted in the West along realist lines, its members variously contributed to the formation of the bureaucratic Chinese empire, and early elements of Daoism. The later Han takes Guan Zhong as forefather of the Fajia. Its more Legalistic figures include ministers Li Kui and Shang Yang, and more Daoistic figures Shen Buhai and Shen Dao, with the late Han Feizi drawing on both. Later centuries took Xun Kuang as a teacher of Han Fei and Li Si. Succeeding emperors and reformers often followed the templates set by Han Fei, Shen Buhai and Shang Yang, but the Qin to Tang were more characterized by their traditions.

Though Chinese administration had no single origin, with a major influence by the Han dynasty, grand chancellor Shen Buhai likely played a key role in the development of the merit system, and could be seen as its founder. With formative influence for the Qin and Chinese law, Shang Yang reformed the peripheral Qin state into a strongly centralized, militarily powerful kingdom, ultimately unifying China in 221 BCE. Largely responsible for their synthesis as a school, the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; also contains some of the earliest commentaries on the Daodejing. Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;Art of War&quot; recommends Han Fei&#x27;s concepts of power, technique, inaction, and impartiality, punishment and reward.

==Masters Texts&#x27;s category==

One of Sima Tan&#x27;s (165–110 BCE) six schools of thought discussing governance in the early Han dynasty Records of the Grand Historian, those listed under the fa school or family (Jia 家) were probably never an organized school like the Confucians or Mohists. They were influential in different places and times, though their associated works arguably were focused on the use of standards (fa) in the administration, as including law by Shang Yang.

Later Han Confucian Imperial Archivists Liu Xiang (77–6BCE) and Liu Xin (c.46bce–23ce) used Fajia as a category of Masters Texts in the Han imperial library. It would become a major category in Han dynasty catalogues, namely the Han state&#x27;s own Book of Han (111ce). Alongside Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, Shen Dao and the Han Feizi, it included six other texts, now lost.

Sima Tan did not name anyone under the schools; Sima Qian classified Shen Buhai, Shen Dao and Han Fei as &quot;rooted&quot; in Huang-Lao or &quot;Yellow Emperor and Laozi Daoism&quot;, while combinations of Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, and Han Fei were earlier often recalled under Han Fei&#x27;s doctrine of Xing-Ming. Fajia and Legalism arguably represent two different later Han dynasty Confucian interpretations. Sima Tan still appears to have understood that standards (fa) were used in the administration and not just penal law.

#Sima Tan described the fa school (Fajia) as emphasizing administrative protocols that ignore kinship and social status, treating everyone equally and thereby elevating the ruler above humanity. Sima Tan praises Fajia for “honoring rulers and derogating subjects, and clearly distinguishing offices so that no one can overstep [his responsibilities].&quot; He criticizes Fajia as strict with little kindness, as a one-time policy that could not be constantly applied.
# Included in the Book of Han by Ban Gu, Liu Xin associates them as &quot;probably&quot; deriving from a Zhou &quot;Ministry of Justice&quot;. Liu Xin adds that Fajia &quot;make reward dependable and punishment inescapable, as a support to control by ceremony&quot;, rejecting teaching and benevolence, and concern for others, aiming to perfect government relying only on punishment and law, inflicting corporal punishment even on closest kin, and demeaning mercy and generosity.

Some chapters of the Han Feizi &quot;eschew grace and benevolence&quot; (35 &amp; 47), and Han Fei does recommend execution for violation of the offices, but so does King Wu of Zhou in the Book of Documents. Shen Buhai or Shen Dao do not endorse harsh punishment. Shen Buhai is said to have opposed punishment; his title &quot;Buhai&quot; literally means &quot;does not harm&quot;. A confused revulsion against the Qin dynasty developed over the course of the Han, associating them with harsh punishment as argued by the Book of Lord Shang and Han Feizi. Shen Buhai is glossed under penal law with Shang Yang through the influence of the Han Feizi, which discusses them together. A figure from chapter 40, Liu Xin argues that Shen Dao influenced Shen Buhai and Han Fei.

Although the terms Fajia and Legalism have still seen some usage in recent years, scholarship leading up to the modern era has often avoided them for partisan anachronism or inaccuracy by modern standards, arguing against one or the other. Xun Kuang criticized Shen Dao as &quot;obsessed with fa&quot;, but no one appears to have used Fajia as an ideological term for himself or his opponent in the Warring States period. It likely only meant &quot;law abiding families&quot; in Mencius&#x27;s time. It might have meant something like &quot;methods expert in economic affairs&quot; in the context of the Guanzi.

==Legalist associations==
Early a remote backwater to the west, Shang Yang&#x27;s reforms propelled the Qin state to power. But central China was likely not familiar with him or the Qin state&#x27;s Book of Lord Shang&#x27;s until just before imperial unification, and similar ideas on power to the others only develop late in the work. The late Xun Kuang was familiar with Shen Buhai, Shen Dao, and the Qin, but still seems unaware of Shang Yang. Rather than Shang Yang, Shen Buhai might speculatively be compared with the older Li Kui or Zichan in the broad sense that they all sought more meritocratic government.

As chancellors of neighboring states, Shang Yang&#x27;s and Shen Buhai&#x27;s doctrines would have intersected by the Qin dynasty, and the late Han Feizi, associated with Han Fei of the Hann state, is Shang Yang&#x27;s first reference outside the Book of Lord Shang. The Han Feizi would suggest that the laws and methods of Shang Yang and Guan Zhong, with their associated works, may have circulated at that late time. Contrasting Shang Yang and Shen Buhai, Chapter 43 (&quot;Ding fa&quot; 定法) nonetheless likely contributed to their association, and a Legalist interpretation of what the Confucians later called the Fa school. It is broadly relevant for their introduction.

Taking Shang Yang as representative, Han Fei considered fa (standards) necessary, as including law, decrees, reward and punishment, as well as administrative standards or method (fa) &quot;in the hands&quot; of the ruler, representative of his own state&#x27;s Shen Buhai. The latter he terms (shu 术) administrative Method or Technique, defined as examining the abilities of ministers, appointing candidates in accordance with their capabilities, and holding ministerial achievements (Xing &quot;forms&quot;) accountable to their proposals (ming &quot;names&quot;); essentially, government job contracts. Following the Han Feizi, Shang Yang, Shen Buhai and Han Fei were often identified under Xing-Ming.

Their combined figures might have influenced the Qin dynasty, but a souring association of them with the Qin only developed over the course of the Han dynasty. The early Huainanzi merely contrasts their combined figures with its own doctrine, glossing them as penal. With an early meaning of model or regulation, and less words in the Warring States period, the meaning of Xing (刑) is gradually lost as punishment. Before Han Fei, the popular Xun Kuang already uses Xing-Ming as &quot;the names of punishments&quot; in his introduction. It becomes a term for penal record keepers in the Han. By the later Han, scholars less knowledgeable than Liu Xiang were not always aware that Shen Buhai and Shang Yang differed. Unable to interpret the term, they become &quot;the school of punishments&quot; after the fall of the Han dynasty.

==Daoist associations==
Before Sima Tan, doctrines were identified only by Masters (Zi), for which their texts are named. Later termed Daoist, A.C. Graham takes the Zhuangzi as preferring a private life, while the Daodejing (Laozi) contains an art of rule. Xun Kuang does not perceive them as belonging to one school in his time, listing them separately. The Outer Zhuangzi adopts Laozi and Zhuangzi into the same history of thought. Jia Yi recalls them together, but the Huainanzi is the main example of Zhuangzi influence in the Han dynasty. A Laozi-Zhuangzi Daoism may be more accurate for the third century A.D.

Along with founding Han dynasty figures, Sima Qian claimed Shen Buhai, Han Fei and Shen Dao as &quot;rooted&quot; in Huang-Lao or &quot;Yellow Emperor and Laozi (Daoism)&quot;, which Graham described as &quot;syncretist&quot;. In a &quot;strictly practical&quot;, governmental sense, they could perhaps &quot;loosely&quot; be considered as originating in a Daoistic &#x27;way in thought&#x27;. With Daoist and Legalist distinctions not existing before the Han, those who included Daodejing commentaries in the Han Feizi probably did not two schools; they probably saw works of rule. Huang-Lao&#x27; typified texts are generally more &quot;naturalist&quot; than Han Fei, but Sima Qian and Ban Gu describe Huang-Lao in this way. A literature of rule arguably dominated the period, describing early Confucian texts as well, if from a different standpoint.

Laozi, Zhuangzi, Shen Buhai or Sima Qian do not generally advocate laws (fa), but texts like the Huang-Lao boshu more broadly did advocate administrative standards (fa). Although considering Han Fei harsh, Sima Qian discusses him and Shen Buhai alongside Laozi and Zhuang Zhou, espousing their origination in dao (&quot;Way&quot;) and de (power, virtue), simply giving Shang Yang his own chapter. Shen Buhai bares a &quot;striking&quot; resemblance to Laozi. Chapter 40 of the Han Feizi quotes from Shen Dao alongside Zhuangzi.

Applying the practice of wu wei or non-action more to the ruler than anyone else, the Han Feizi is opposed with later or more spiritual forms of Daoism as a practical state philosophy not accepting a &#x27;permanent way of statecraft&#x27;. A central idea in their period, the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; and Sima Tan profess their views as a matter of changing with the times. Recalling Shen Buhai and Laozi, Shen Buhai and Han Fei&#x27;s Way of the Ruler (Chapter 5) promotes &quot;the ruler’s quiescence&quot;, &quot;practical recommendations&quot; and the management of ministers rather than a Daoist way of life or metaphysics, but &quot;affirms the primacy of the dao&quot;, with a ruler who should follow the &#x27;natural order&#x27; or Way, responding rather than acting himself. 

==Changing with the times==

The early work of Feng Youlan took the statesmen as fully understanding that needs change with the times and material circumstances; admitting that people may have been more virtuous anciently, Han Fei believes that new problems require new solutions. Earlier thought to be rare, in fact, a changing with times paradigm, or one of &quot;timeliness&quot;, &quot;dominated&quot; the age. Yuri Pines takes Shang Yang and Han Fei&#x27;s more specific view of history as an &quot;evolutionary process&quot; as contrasting. It &quot;might&quot; have influenced an end of history view expressed by the Qin dynasty, but would be a radical departure from earlier ideas. The Qin idea of an eternal dynasty would seem more connected with that of relying on law rather than the ruler.

In what A. C. Graham took to be a &quot;highly literary fiction&quot;, as Pines recalls, the Book of Lord Shang&#x27;s chapter 1, “Revising the laws,” opens with a debate held by Duke Xiao of Qin, seeking to &quot;consider the changes in the affairs of the age, inquire into the basis for correcting standards, and seek the Way to employ the people.&quot; Gongsun attempts to persuade the Duke to change with the times, with the &quot;Shangjunshu&quot; citing him as saying: &quot;Orderly generations did not [follow] a single way; to benefit the state, one need not imitate antiquity.&quot;

Graham compares Han Fei in particular with the Malthusians, as &quot;unique in seeking a historical cause of changing conditions&quot;, namely population growth, acknowledging that an underpopulated society only need moral ties. The &quot;Guanzi&quot; text sees punishment as unnecessary in ancient times with an abundance of resources, making it a question of poverty rather than human nature. Human nature is a Confucian issue. Graham otherwise considers the customs current of the time as having no significance to the statesmen, even if they may be willing to conform the government to them.

Shen Dao claimed to espouse a Dao or &quot;Way&quot; of Heaven, but the concept would not seem to have been as developed in his time, and does not appear to focus on it as much as later texts. Usually describing Shang Yang and Han Fei, Sinologist Hansen took Shen Dao and Han Fei as aiming at what they took to be the &quot;&#x27;actual&#x27; course of history&quot;. A figure listed before Shen Buhai and Shang Yang&#x27;s combination in the Han Feizi&#x27;s outer chapters, Hansen takes the Han Feizi as concretizing Shen Dao&#x27;s ideas on circumstantial authority, and a changing with the times paradigm introduced in its first chapters, under the Dao or &quot;Way&quot; of Laozi, which can be seen in Chapter 5 combined with Shen Buhai.

Stressing timeliness, Sima Tan&#x27;s description of the Daojia or &#x27;Dao school&#x27; says: &quot;It (the dao or way) shifts with the times and changes in response to things&quot;, a view earlier found in Han Fei and Xun Kuang. Hong Kong professor Liu Xiaogan takes the Zhuangzi and Laozi (Tao te Ching) in fact as more focused on &quot;according with nature&quot; than timeliness. Sima Tan&#x27;s description describes Huang-Lao more, whose followers can be theorized as defining the former according to the latter.

Taking Shang Yang as inheriting from Li Kui and Wu Qi, despite anti-Confucianism in the Shangjunshu, professor Ch&#x27;ien Mu still considered that &quot;People say merely that Legalist origins are in Dao and De (power/virtue) [i.e., Daoist principles], apparently not aware that their origins in fact are in Confucianism. Their observance of law and sense of public justice are wholly in the spirit of Confucius&#x27; rectification of names and return to propriety, but transformed in accordance with the conditions of the age.&quot; In the ancient society, punishment by law would typically only apply to the people, while the nobles are only punished by ritual. But needs change with the times. Making use of the term, it seems probable that Shen Buhai does in fact have administrative ideas that go back to the Confucian rectification of names, or cheng ming.

Hu Shih took Xun Kuang, Han Fei and Li Si as &quot;champions of the idea of progress through conscious human effort&quot;, with Li Si abolishing the feudal system, unifying the empire, law, language, thought and belief, presenting a memorial to the throne in which he condemns all those who &quot;refused to study the present and believed only in the ancients on whose authority they dared to criticize&quot;. With a quotation from Xun Kuang:

In contrast to Xun Kuang as the classically purported teacher of Han Fei and Li Si, Han Fei does not believe that a tendency to disorder demonstrates that people are evil or unruly. As a counterpoint, the Han Feizi and Shen Dao do still employ argumentative reference to &#x27;sage kings&#x27;; the Han Feizi claims the distinction between the ruler&#x27;s interests and private interests as said to date back to Cangjie, while government by Fa (standards) is said to date back to time immemorial, considering the demarcation between public and private a &quot;key element&quot; in the &quot;enlightened governance&quot; of the purported former kings.

==Legalists or administrators?==
While the term Legalism has still seen some conventional usage in recent years, such as in &quot;Adventures in Chinese Realism&quot;, apart from its anachronism academia has avoided it for reasons which date back to Sinologist Herrlee G. Creel&#x27;s 1961 &quot;Legalists or Administrators?&quot; As the Han Feizi presents, while Shang Yang most commonly uses the term fa (standards) in the sense of law, Shen Buhai uses fa (standards) in the administration, which Creel translated as &quot;method&quot;. The use of fa (standards) as an administrative method does not require punishment at all. Han Fei and Shen Dao make some use of fa (standards) as akin to law, and some use of reward and punishment, but often use fa standards similarly to Shen Buhai: as an administrative technique. Shen Buhai uses fa (standards) to compare official&#x27;s duties and performances, and Han Fei often emphasizes fa in this sense. With a particular quotation from the Han Feizi as example:

From a modern perspective, Shen Buhai could be considered Legalist to the degree that he succeeded in imposing rules on the bureaucracy. But Xing-Ming is arguably Shen Buhai&#x27;s &quot;most important administrative contribution&quot;, and one of the Han Feizi&#x27;s central concepts. Recalling Shen Buhai and Laozi,

the Han Feizi&#x27;s introductory chapter 5 on Xing-Ming includes specific practical recommendations. Correlating ministerial proposals (Ming &quot;names&quot;) and achievements (Xing &quot;forms&quot;) as contracts, although not required, Xing-Ming can be considered the Han Feizi&#x27;s most detailed application of reward and punishment in connection with Chapter 7&#x27;s The Two Handles, if not the works central practical theory. Xing-Ming more broadly is amongst the Han Feizi&#x27;s most philosophically sophisticated arguments. But the Two Handles aims more at monopolizing reward and punishment to prevent usurpation, and does not &quot;presuppose a legal code.&quot; 

With Shang Yang said to be executed after the death of Duke Xiao of Qin, although not abandoning his reforms, the Qin would abandon his harsh punishments, and ultimately his dominating focus on agriculture. The Book of Lord Shang would seek to innovate broader means of &quot;empowering the state&quot;, including standards (fa) for promotion. It contains some pre-imperial ideas about what an order based on law and bureaucracy might look like once established. Often presenting its ideas in the context of the late Hann state that the work claims needs more law, inheriting Shang Yang&#x27;s current, the Han Feizi aspires to a state with law, wealth and a powerful military at the end of the Warring States period. That the Han Feizi is not legislative suggests that component was still more theoretical and advocative.

The work&#x27;s choice to &quot;include&quot; law is not accidental, and is at least indirectly intended to benefit the people, insomuch as the state is benefited by way of order. It can (or has, by a law expert rather than Sinologist) be compared to a legislative rule of law inasmuch as it develops beyond purposes serving those of simply the ruler, operating separately from him once established. Han Fei says: &quot;The enlightened ruler governs his officials; he does not govern the people.&quot; The ruler cannot jointly govern the people in a large state. Nor can his direct subordinates themselves do it. The ruler wields methods to control officials.

The Book of Lord Shang itself addresses statutes mainly from an administrative standpoint, and addresses many administrative questions, including an agricultural mobilization, collective responsibility, and statist meritocracy. Turning towards management, Chapter 25 of the Shangjunshu&#x27;s so-called &quot;Attention to law&quot; advocates &quot;strict reliance on law&quot; (fa) mainly as &quot;norms of promotion and demotion&quot; to judge officials and thwart ministerial cliques, though still fell back on agriculture and war as the standard for promotion.

==Agriculture and war==

With the Book of Lord Shang emphasizing legal standards (fa), and a predominantly penal legal reception by Han Fei and the Han dynasty, the early work of Sinologist Herrlee G. Creel accepted Shang Yang as Legalist, arguing Shen Buhai more administrative. But Shang Yang&#x27;s program was broader than law; Han Fei elementalizes him under it. Aside from penal law, the Book of Lord Shang primarily emphasizes agriculture and war, which may have been Shang Yang&#x27;s &quot;single most important slogan.&quot;

Early Warring States period ministerial recruitment aimed to establish universal census, taxes and military service as part of mobilization efforts. The Book of Lord Shang represents an extreme example of the early trend, the only surviving work of its kind. The Qin&#x27;s military reorganization was a major achievement that shaped its overall policy. Extending to the population, the Qin organized society on a military basis as familial, mutual responsibility groups of five and ten for military recruitment. Sima Qian lists its reform as the first of his accomplishments.

Fa (law) could be considered a first principle of the Book of Lord Shang, but is focused on state power, advocating a rich, centralized state, with a powerful army. Shang Yang&#x27;s economic and political reforms were unprecedented, and far more significant than his personal military achievements. But he was as much a military reformer in his time, and did personally lead Qin to victory over Wei. The Han also recognized him as a military strategist. A work attributed to him, possibly the same, is also listed under the Han Imperial Library&#x27;s Military Books under Strategists.

With Shang Yang said to have reformed Qin law, the Book of Lord Shang does not believe that fa laws will be successful without &quot;investigating the people&#x27;s disposition.&quot; Translator Yuri Pines takes Shang Yang&#x27;s primary doctrine to be that of connecting people&#x27;s inborn nature or dispositions (xing 性) with names (ming 名). The work recommends enacting laws that allow people to &quot;pursue the desire for a name&quot;, namely fame and high social status, or just wealth if acceptable. Ensuring that these &quot;names&quot; are connected with actual benefits, it was hoped that if people are able to pursue these, they will be less likely to commit crimes, and more likely to engage in hard work or fight in wars.

A figure in the Stratagems of the Warring States, although not the primary focus of his administrative treatise, Shen Buhai was both a diplomat and military reformer, at least for defense, and is said to have maintained the security of his state. Although Xun Kuang is probably accurate in considering Shen Dao to be focused on fa administrative standards, as introduced by Feng Youlan he was remembered in early scholarship for his secondary subject of shi or &quot;situational authority&quot;, of which he is spoken in Chapter 40 of the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; and incorporated into &quot;The Art of War&quot;. He only uses the term twice in his fragments.

==Huang-Lao and Laozi==
As a view still espoused by Sinologist Hansen of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Daoism, a &quot;Legalism&quot; and Huang-Lao &quot;Yellow Emperor Daoism&quot; dominant by the Qin to early Han would theoretically be borne out by the Huang-lao typified Mawangdui silk texts. The term &quot;Huang-Lao&quot; might be retrospective, and the Han Feizi&#x27;s Daoistic commentaries could be late additions. But they would seem to more accurately describe the syncretism that was becoming dominant by the Qin dynasty. Although It remains a question how much of it might have been extant in Shen Buhai&#x27;s time, the Mawangdui and Guanzi regard fa administrative standards as generated by the Dao, theoretically placing it, and some of those the Confucians later called Legalists, within a &quot;loosely Daoist&quot; context.

The Mawagndui can be argued to have been written in the early Han, when their political positions might have been more appealing, but almost all scholars considered them to have been at least Pre-han, even before Han Fei. Michael Loewe still placed its Jingfa text before Qin unification. The Yellow Emperor is a major figure in one of its texts. Amongst other strains of thought, the more metaphysical, but still politically oriented Boshu text more broadly includes contents bearing resemblance to Shen Buhai, Shen Dao and Han Fei, developing arguments more comparable to natural law than an old interpretation of legal positivism for Shang Yang and Han Fei. If Huang-Lao did describe a self-conscious current, it would have been more of a tendency than a unified doctrine, with early &quot;Huang-Lao&quot; Han dynasty administrators named by Sima Qian, like Cao Shen, taking a more &quot;hands off&quot; approach after the fall of the Qin dynasty.

===Han Fei and Laozi===
More political than a typical reading of the Daodejing (Laozi), rather than &quot;using&quot; the work for politics, &#x27;Han Fei&#x27; may be reading from an older, more political version. With the Mawangdui found from a member of the political class, Hansen argued these version should not be simply assumed as &#x27;originals&#x27;, interpreting Huang-Lao as an early, politically partisan variety of what would later be termed Daoism. If the authors of the Han Feizi were not all sincere in their Laoist beliefs, the work would still have served as a suitable critique of Confucianism and Mohism, or for impartial laws and techniques as purportedly bolstering the authority of a wu wei semi-inactive ruler.

An interpretation of the Daodejing (Laozi) as simply cynically political would be flawed. Still, together with qigong, it can be viewed as a manual for politics and military strategy. In contrast to its modern representation, the Laozi of the early Mawangdui Silk Texts, and two of the three earlier Guodian Chu Slips, place political commentaries, or &quot;ruling the state&quot;, first. The Han Feizi&#x27;s more political contemporaries likely read them in the same order. Arguably lacking in metaphysics, associated content instead possesses mythologies. Nonetheless, in contrast to all prior Ways, the Daodejing emphasizes quietude and lack as wu wei. A central concept of Daoism, together especially with the Tao te Ching, Shen Buhai, Han Fei, Zhuangzi, and so-called Huang-Lao Daoism all have wu wei as a governmental function, emphasizing the political usages and advantages of reduced activity as a method of control for survival, social stability, long life, and rule, refraining from action in-order to take advantage of favorable developments in affairs.

The Han Feizi&#x27;s late Daodejing commentaries are comparable with the Daoism of the Guanzi Neiye, but otherwise utilizes the Laozi more as a theme for methods of rule. Although the Han Feizi has Daoistic conceptions of objective viewpoints (&quot;mystical states&quot;), if his sources had them, he lacks a conclusive belief in universal moralities or natural laws, sharing with Shang Yang and Shen Dao a view of man as self-interested. Advocating against manipulation of the mechanisms of government, despite an advocacy of passive mindfulness, noninterference, and quiescence, the ability to prescribe and command is still built into the Han Feizi&#x27;s Xing-ming administrative method.

==Xing-Ming (introduction)==

Liu Xiang (77–6BCE) considered Shen Buhai&#x27;s doctrine to be that of &quot;Xing-Ming&quot;, or &quot;form&quot; and &quot;name&quot;, described as holding &quot;outcomes&quot; accountable to &quot;claims&quot;. Sima Qian (c.145–c.86BCE) glosses Shen Buhai, Han Fei and Shang Yang under it, claiming Shen Buhai and Han Fei as favoring it, but rooted in Huang-Lao or &quot;Yellow Emperor Daoism&quot;. The Han Feizi actually states than Shen Buhai uses the earlier Mohist &quot;ming-shi&quot; or name and reality. Hence, Xing-Ming likely originates in the debates of the or later or Neo-Mohists and school of names (Xingmingjia). It probably goes back to the Confucian rectification of names, or cheng ming, a term which Shen Buhai still seems to have used even if the later Han Feizi contrasts with it.

A commentary to the Shiji recounts Shen Buhai&#x27;s book as advocating Method rather than punishment. An early bureaucratic pioneer, Shen Buhai was not so much more advanced as he was more focused on bureaucracy. Though not his only example, Han Fei&#x27;s discussion of Method in Chapter 43 provides a basic explanation for Xing-Ming, saying: &quot;Method is to confer office in accordance with a candidate&#x27;s capabilities; to hold achievement (Xing forms) accountable to claim (Ming names); and to examine the ability of the assembled ministers.&quot; It central principle may have been accountability &quot;more than anything else.&quot;

Naming individuals to their roles as ministers (e.g. &quot;Steward of Cloaks&quot; Chapter 7), in contrast to the earlier Confucians, Han Fei at the end of the Warring States period holds ministers accountable for their proposals, actions and performance. Xun Kuang often has more specific criteria for the appointment of officials, but the Han Feizi&#x27;s &quot;methods&quot; are in general &quot;quite detailed.&quot; Its Xing-Ming method was likely the most &#x27;mechanically&#x27; complex example of its kind for the period. In this regard, the late Warring States theories of Xun Kuang and the Mohists were still far more generalized.

Sima Qian asserts the First Emperor as proclaiming Xing-Ming&#x27;s practice. A less technically complex example at least can found be in the late per-imperial Lushi Chunqiu. Although by its own statements favoring self cultivation, A.C. Graham took the Outer Zhuangzi as incorporating Xing-Ming. Emphasizing wu wei, dao and de and benevolence over appointment and investigation, reward and punishment, it mainly criticizes those who reverse its priorities.

With their doctrines scarcely visible in the early Han outside the Mawangdui silk texts, according to the Shiji, the practice emerged again under the Daoistic Emperor Wen of Han and his trusted ministers, but &quot;cautious, unobtrusive and firm&quot;, more akin to Shen Buhai than Han Fei. Attributed back to Shen Buhai, it becomes the term for secretaries who had charge of records in penal decisions by the Han dynasty.

Early connected with Shen Buhai and school of names type figures as &quot;Method&quot;, Xing-Ming sometimes refers to a combination of Shang Yang and Han Fei by the Han dynasty. Despite a potential contribution of such ideas to the founding of the Imperial Examination, the meaning of the term itself would ultimately be confused and lost in conflation with punishment (Xing 刑) by the time of the Western Qin, sometimes as early as the third century&#x27;s Eastern Han. Likely unable to interpret it, Jin Zhuo would split the school of names as the Mingjia, and those already classified as Legalists as the Xingjia or school of punishments.

===Xing-Ming (selected works)===
With visible usages of Xing-Ming, the Han Feizi&#x27;s chapter 5 Zhudao (道主) or &quot;Way of the Ruler&quot; recalls Laozi and Shen Buhai in parallel style, with the idea of names &quot;rectifying themselves&quot; &quot;anticipated&quot; by Shen Buhai. Although Sima Qian does not claim it amongst his short list of chapters, he may have taken Han Fei as Huang-Lao based on its conception of the Dao, if the idea wasn&#x27;t already established.
The Mawangdui Jingfa regards Dao as generating fa standards. Shen Buhai, Han Fei, and Sima Tan&#x27;s preferably &#x27;inactive&#x27; ruler contracts an assembly of ministers, with Xing-Ming correlating job proposals as Ming (&quot;names&quot;, or verbal &quot;claims&quot;) with the Xing &quot;forms&quot; or &quot;shapes&quot; that they take. With early examples in Shen Buhai (Shenzi), several of the Mawangdui&#x27;s texts bare resemblance to Han Fei&#x27;s Chapter 5 discussion of &quot;Xing-Ming&quot; and its &quot;brilliant (or intelligent) ruler&quot;, as do other eclectic Huang-Lao typified works, like the Guanzi, Huainanzi, and Sima Qian&#x27;s Shiji.

Sima Tan partly described the Daoist school (Daojia) based on what is &quot;clearly&quot; the idea of the Xing-Ming court.

Typically termed Daoist for the early Han, the Lushi Chunqiu demonstrates that a philosophy promoting the wu wei reduced activity of the ruler goes back to the Warring States period, containing a &quot;Daoist-Legalist&quot; fusion comparable to Shen Buhai, Shen Dao, Han Fei, Guanzi and the Mawangdui Huangdi sijing. The Confucian archivists simply classify the text as Zajia (&quot;Syncretist&quot;) rather than Daojia (&quot;Daoism&quot;) or Fajia (&quot;Legalism&quot;). With an example from the chapter &quot;Ren shu&quot;:

Creel takes particular note of passage 17 of the Daodejing (Laozi) as interpreted by J. J. L. Duyvendak, &quot;arousing wide interest&quot; but &quot;quite old in Chinese literature&quot; as that of a form of Daoism &quot;leaning heavily toward Legalism&quot;. Creel takes the Wenzi as example, which draws on the Daodejing, Han Feizi and Huainanzi. The &#x27;enigmatic&#x27; passage does not directly mention rulers, but would seem to discuss the ruler as one who &quot;does everything without acting&quot;. In the Guodian and Mawangdui versions, it is combined with passage 18. Shen Dao&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Loyalty&quot; includes a &quot;concern that a focus on loyalty arises only when things have already begun to go wrong.&quot;

==School of names==
Prior Shen Buhai, Xingming likely originates earlier in the school of names. The Zhan Guo Ce quotes one of their paradoxes: &quot;Su Qin said to the King of Qin, &#x27;Exponents of Xingming all say that a white horse is not a horse.&#x27;&quot; Su Qin nonetheless took Gongsun Long&#x27;s white horse paradox to be a Xingming administrative strategy. Other people were simply not intended to understand it. Despite opposition to their paradoxes, the Han Feizi provides a white horse strategy: the chief minister of Yan pretended to see a white horse dash out the gate. All of his subordinates denied having seen anything, save one, who ran out and returned claiming to have seen it, identifying him as a flatterer.

But words and names are essential to administration, and discussion on the connection between realities and their names were common to all schools in the classical period (500bce-150bce), as including the Mohists and posthumous categories of Daoists, Legalists and School of Names. Its earlier thinking was actually most developed by the Confucians, while later thinking was characterized by paradoxes. Shen Dao and Daoism question the premises of prior schools, in particular that of the Confucians and Mohists, representing an even higher degree of relativist skepticism. With a narrower bureaucratic focus, Shen Buhai, Xun Kuang, Han Fei can still be compared with the early social, Confucian rectification of names.

Although more or less representing an actual social category of debaters, Sima Qian divided the schools (or categories) along elemental lines, as including Ming (&quot;names&quot;, the usage of words in philosophy and administration including contracts) for the Mingjia School of Names, and fa (standards including law and method) for those later termed Fajia (&quot;Legalists&quot;). Engaging in discussions of &quot;sameness and difference&quot;, such distinctions would naturally be useful in litigation and administration. But the more advanced Names and Realities discussions date to the later Warring States period, after Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, and Mencius, i.e. in Han Fei&#x27;s era.

The practices and doctrines of Shen Buhai, Han Fei and the school of names are all termed Mingshi (name and reality) and Xingming (form and name). The administrators of both groupings have both elements and share the same concerns, evaluating bureaucratic performance, and the structural relation between ministers and supervisors. The school of names &quot;mingjia&quot; can also inaccurately be translated as &quot;Legalists&quot;, using fa comparative models for litigation. The Qin dynasty used comparative model manuals to guide penal legal procedure,

==Eradicating punishments==
Translator Yuri Pines takes the final chapter (26) of the Book of Lord Shang (Shangjunshu) as reflecting the administrative practices of late pre-imperial and Imperial Qin dynasty, aligning with knowledge of Qin governance. Although seeking governance more broadly, protecting the people from ministerial abuse becomes more important than punishing the people. Taken as universally beneficial, in an attempt to achieve the &quot;blessed eradication of punishments through punishments&quot;, clear laws are taught that the people can use against ministers abusing the statutes, punishing them according to the penalties of the statute abused. Han Fei advocates the same, but is more focused on accomplishing it through the administrative power of the ruler. A major reform of the primarily administrative Qin dynasty focuses more on restraining ministers, instituting office divisions that cannot punish at will.

If, as depicted, at least part of the Han Feizi dates dates to the late Warring States period period, the Shangjunshu could have circulated on the eve of unification. The work&#x27;s adoption by the Han Feizi can give the appearance of a living current for the old harsh punishments of Shang Yang that can mistakenly be imposed backward. Even if the Shangjunshu only passingly suggests that a need for punishment would pass away, the Qin nonetheless abandoned Shang Yang&#x27;s heavy punishments. The Book of Lord Shang itself is not a homogeneous ideology, but shifts substantially over its development. As the work&#x27;s first reference, the Han Feizi recalls its earlier Chapter 4, saying:

Punishments in the Qin and early Han were commonly pardoned or redeemed in exchange for fines, labor or one to several aristocratic ranks, even up to the death penalty. Not the most common punishments, the Qin&#x27;s mutilating punishment likely exist in part to create labor in agriculture, husbandry, workshops, and wall building. Replacing mutilation, labor from one to five years becomes the common heavy punishment in early Imperial China, generally in building roads and canals.

As a component of general colonization, the most common heavy punishment was expulsion to the new colonies. The Han engage in the same practice, transferring criminals to the frontiers for military service, with Emperor Wu and later emperors recruiting men sentenced to death for expeditionary armies. The Qin have mutilating punishments like nose cutting, but with tattooing as most common. They &quot;were not extraordinarily severe for their time&quot;, and form a continuity with the early Han dynasty, abolishing mutilations in 167 BC.

Han-era writer Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC) considered Qin officials and taxes severe, but did not characterise punishments as such; in fact, Dong criticized the Qin system for its inability to punish criminals. Aiming to reduce punishment to a minimum, the idea of redemption can be found in the Analects of Confucius, attempting to ensure a correct application of the rectification of names. Exile as a heavy punishment in ancient China dates back to at least the Spring and Autumn period.

===Han Feizi===
For Han Fei, the power structure is unable to bare an autonomous ministerial practice of reward and punishment. Han Fei mainly targets ministerial infringements. The Han Feizi&#x27;s main argument for punishment by standards, Chapter 7&#x27;s The Two Handles, is that delegating reward and punishment to ministers has led to an erosion of power and collapse of states in his era, and should be monopolized, using severe punishment in an attempt to abolish ministerial infringements, and therefore punishment. Monopolization can be considered a core of Han Fei&#x27;s practice of fa laws and methods, aiming to prevent usurpation. 

Mostly concerned with the ministers, Han Fei does not regard the people as an enemy, as the earlier part of the Book of Lord Shang did. The Han Feizi occasionally even has ideas of public good. &quot;Preventing the strong from expoliting the weak&quot; will benefit the sage ruler Han Fei addresses, but also the elderly and the orphan. While Han Fei believes that a benevolent government that does not punish will harm the law, and create confusion, he also believes that a violent and tyrannical ruler will create an irrational government, with conflict and rebellion. For this reason, the Han Feizi also opposes corvee, with hardship turning the people toward powerful ministers to the detriment of the ruler and state.

Shen Dao, the first member of Han Fei&#x27;s triad between the figures in the later chapters, never suggests kinds of punishments, as that is not the point. The main point is that it would involve the ruler too much to decide them personally, exposing him to resentment. The ruler should decide punishments using fa standards. Han Fei does does not suggest kinds of punishments either, and would not seem to care about punishment as retribution itself. He only cares whether they work, and therefore end punishments.

Although &quot;benevolence and righteousness&quot; may simply be &quot;glittering words&quot;, other means can potentially be included. While recalling Shang Yang, Han Fei places a more equal emphasis on reward to encourage people and produce good results; punishment for him was secondary to simply controlling ministers through techniques. Although these could be expected to include espionage in his time, they consisted primarily simply in written agreements.

===Justice===
Emphasizing a dichotomy between the people and state, the Book of Lord Shang in particular has been regarded as anti-people, with alienating statements that a weak people makes a strong military. But, such statements are concentrated in a few chapters, and the work does still vacillate against ministerial abuses. Michael Loewe still regarded the laws as primarily concerned with peace and order. They were harsh in Shang Yang&#x27;s time mainly out of hope that people will no longer dare to break them.

Sima Qian argues the Qin dynasty, relying on rigorous laws, as nonetheless &quot;insufficiently&quot; rigorous for a completely consistent practice, suggesting them as not having always delivered justice as others understood it. From a modern perspective, it is &quot;impossible&quot; to deny at least the &quot;&#x27;basic&#x27; justice of Qin laws&quot;. Rejecting the whims of individual ministers in favor of clear protocols, and insisting on forensic examinations, for an ancient society they are ultimately more definable by fairness than cruelty.

With contradicting evidences, as a last resort, officials could rely on beatings, but had to be reported and compared with evidence, and cannot actually punish without confession. With administration and judiciary not separated in ancient societies, the Qin develop the idea of the judge magistrate as a detective, emerging in the culture of early Han dynasty theater with judges as detectives aspiring to truth as justice.

Inasmuch as Han Fei has modernly been related with the idea of justice, he opposes the early Confucian idea that ministers should be immune to penal law. With an at least incidental concern for the people, the Han Feizi is &quot;adamant that blatant manipulation and subversion of law to the detriment of the state and ruler should never be tolerated&quot;: 

==Sources in Legalist mythos==
Jia Yi criticized Shang Yang In the reign of Emperor Wen, but along with propriety and righteousness himself advocates fa laws (models), ranks and the execution of usurpers. Arguing for Daoism (Daojia) in the reign of Emperor Wu, Sima Qian depicted Li Si as reciting a distorted version of Chapter 43 to the Second Emperor. Contrary to earlier depictions, along with other Han dynasty authors, Sima Qian also depicts Confucius as a legalistic figure. Advocating law, punishment and meritocratic appointment, Dong Zhongshu simply associates Shang Yang, Shen Buhai and Han Fei with the Qin dynasty again.

===Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)===
The Han dynasty mainly villainizes the First Emperor of China as arrogant and inflexible, blaming the second emperor for the fall of Qin. In the early Han, Jia Yi (200–169 BCE) associates the first Emperor with cruel punishments. Amongst figures that would otherwise be to taken to be his own Huang-Lao typified allies, Sima Qian glosses Jia Yi a scholar of both Shang Yang and Shen Buhai. While he likely had read both, he was a more likely proponent of Shen Buhai, supporting regulation of the bureaucracy and feudal lords.

Being both a Daoistic and Confucian doctrine, he favored the practice of Wu wei, or non-action by the ruler, against the practice of law. Despite advocating wuwei inaction by the ruler, and writing the Ten Crimes of Qin in opposition to harsh punishments, figures like Jia Yi were opposed for attempting to regulate the bureaucracy, leading to his banishment under ministerial pressure. The Emperor sent him to teach his sons. Mark Edward Lewis modernly characterized it as a politically motivated mythos.

===Liu An (179–122 BCE)===
Sinologists Herrlee G. Creel and Yuri Pines cite the Huainanzi, associated with Liu An (179–122 bce), as the earliest combinational gloss of Shen Buhai with Shang Yang, comparing them as one person with harsh punishments to their own doctrine. Positively receiving reunification of the empire, the text opposes centralized government and the class of scholar-officials. With ideas of wuwei nonaction, the Huainanzi recommends that the ruler put aside trivial matters, and follow the ways of Fuxi and Nüwa, abiding in Empty Nothingness and Pure Unity. Placing ritual specialists lower than heavenly prognosticators, and aiming to demonstrate how every text that came before it is now part of its own integral unity, the Huainanzi posed a threat to the Han court. Although Chapter 1 is based most strongly on Laozi, the work otherwise most strongly resonates with the Zhuangzi, with influences from the Hanfeizi, Lüshi chunqiu, Mozi, and Guanzi, the Classic of Poetry, etc.

===The Fa School===
Inasmuch as the term Legalism has been used modernly, Dingxin Zhao characterizes the Western Han as developing a Confucian-Legalist state.

Liu An, as traditional author of the Huang-Lao typified Huainanzi, would be suppressed together with the Huang-Lao faction by other potential Han Feizi students, the Shang Yangian Emperor Wu of Han (reign 141-87bce), Gongsun Hong and Zhang Tang. Under Confucian factional pressure, Emperor Wu dismisses the Yellow Emperor Daoists, xingming theoreticians, and those of other philosophies, and discriminates against scholars of Shang Yang, Shen Buhai and Han Fei. When Wu was older, those officials who praised Shang Yang and Li Si and denounced Confucius were upheld. Together with that of the Confucians, the imperial examination system would be instituted through the likely influence of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, who advocated appointment by methodologies of performance checking.

Undoubtedly associating Shang Yang primarily with penal law, no received Han text ever attempted to individually argue or obfuscate Shen Buhai a penal figure. Contrasting with Confucius and the Zhou dynasty, Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC) simply associates Shen Buhai and Shang Yang with the Qin again as reportedly implementing the ideas of Han Fei. Asserting that the Qin, with high taxes and oppressive officials, had declined amidst a failure to punish criminals, he proceeds to associate laws, punishments and meritocratic appointment with the Zhou.

With Sima Qian&#x27;s categories already popular by their time, Imperial Archivists Liu Xiang (77–6BCE) and Liu Xin (c.46bce–23ce) placed Han Fei&#x27;s figures. Liu Xin associates the schools with ancient departments, with the fa-school &quot;probably originating in the department of prisons&quot;, whose descendants in Dong&#x27;s essay, then, failed to punish criminals. Fajia becomes a category of texts in the Han state&#x27;s own Book of Han (111ce), with Dong&#x27;s argument included in his Chapter 56 Biography.

<text>In Christian theology, &quot;legalism&quot; (or &quot;nomism&quot;) is a pejorative term applied to the idea that &quot;by doing good works or by obeying the law, a person earns and merits salvation.&quot; The term has been criticized by certain Christian traditions, such as Conservative Anabaptists who have said that being a disciple of Jesus means being obedient to New Testament commands (such as the holy kiss, baptism, communion, headcovering, and feet washing), and the same is &quot;crucial evidence that an individual has repented, believed, and yielded to Christ.&quot;

==Overview==
The &quot;Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States&quot; defines &quot;legalism&quot; as a pejorative descriptor for &quot;the direct or indirect attachment of behaviors, disciplines, and practices to the belief in order to achieve salvation and right standing before God&quot;, emphasizing a need &quot;to perform certain deeds in order to gain salvation&quot; (works). Additionally, &quot;legalism&quot; pejoratively refers to the view that Christians should not engage in social practices perceived as contrary to a Christian witness, such as gambling, dancing, consuming alcohol, enjoying secular entertainment, or wearing immodest clothing; abstinence from these things is found among fundamental Baptist, Conservative Anabaptist and Conservative Holiness denominations. 

What is viewed as &quot;legalistic&quot; may depend on the Christian denomination; in contrast to Lutheran theology that revolves around the doctrine of justification by faith, Christians of the Anabaptist tradition (who teach salvation by &quot;faith that works&quot;) have argued that being a disciple of Jesus by careful obedience to New Testament commands (such as the holy kiss, baptism, communion, headcovering, and feet washing), is &quot;crucial evidence that an individual has repented, believed, and yielded to Christ.&quot; The Anabaptist theologian Menno Simons rebuffed the Lutheran charge of legalism by referencing :
Reformed commentator Anna Grace Wood stated, &quot;If in 1 Corinthians 11, God commands the wearing of fabric head coverings in worship and we reject this teaching, we are in sin because we are rejecting the Word of God.&quot; The Christian expositor Tony Cooke, citing , has stated that the term &quot;legalist&quot; has been often applied incorrectly to those following biblical directives &quot;that pertain to holiness, obedience, and living godly lives&quot;, concluding that &quot;God&#x27;s grace leads us into obedience, not away from it.&quot; In the same vein, the theologian Leonard Ravenhill summated: &quot;When there is something in the Bible that churches don&#x27;t like, they call it &#x27;legalism&#x27;.&quot;

The Pharisees and Sadducees, as described in the Gospels, are often regarded in general by Christians as legalists. Historically, many Christian New Testament scholars attacked Judaism for supposedly being &quot;legalistic&quot;; this accusation has been rebutted by other scholars, such as E. P. Sanders, who identify this criticism as inaccurate and ahistorical. 

Antinomianism is often regarded as the opposite of legalism, with situational ethics as a third possible position.

In 1921, Ernest De Witt Burton stated that in , the Greek word was &quot;evidently used ... in its legalistic sense, denoting divine law viewed as a purely legalistic system made up of statutes, on the basis of obedience or disobedience to which individuals are approved or condemned as a matter of debt without grace. This is divine law as the legalist defined it.&quot;

<text>The Secretary of State for Air was a secretary of state position in the British government that existed from 1919 to 1964. The person holding this position was in charge of the Air Ministry. The Secretary of State for Air was supported by the Under-Secretary of State for Air.

==History==
The position was created on 10 January 1919 to manage the Royal Air Force. In 1946, the three posts of Secretary of State for War, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Secretary of State for Air became formally subordinated to that of Minister of Defence, which had itself been created in 1940 for the co-ordination of defence and security issues. On 1 April 1964, the Air Ministry was incorporated into the newly created united Ministry of Defence, and the position of Secretary of State for Air was abolished.

<text>Laurence Johnston Peter (September 16, 1919 – January 12, 1990) was a Canadian educator and &quot;hierarchiologist&quot; who is best known to the general public for the formulation of the Peter principle.

==Biography==
Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Peter was the grandson of William Herbert Steves, the founder of Steveston, British Columbia. Peter began his career as a teacher in Vancouver in 1941, and received the degree of Doctor of Education from Washington State University in Pullman in 1963.

In 1966, Peter moved to California, where he became an Associate Professor of Education, Director of the Evelyn Frieden Centre for Prescriptive Teaching, and Coordinator of Programs for Emotionally Disturbed Children at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles.

He became widely known in 1969 upon the publication of &quot;The Peter Principle&quot; – co-authored by Raymond Hull, also from Vancouver – in which he states: &quot;In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence... [I]n time every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties... Work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence.&quot; The Peter principle became one of the most profound principles of management from USC; it is a heavily quoted principle at its Marshall School of Business. 

Another notable quotation of his is that the &quot;noblest of all dogs is the hot dog; it feeds the hand that bites it.&quot;

From 1985 to his death in 1990, Peter attended and was involved in management of the Kinetic Sculpture Race in Humboldt County, California. He proposed an award for the race titled &quot;The Golden Dinosaur Award&quot;, which has been handed out every year since to the first sculptural machine to utterly break down immediately after the start.

At age 70, Peter died of complications from a stroke at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California.

<doc id="226138" wikidata="Q672525" url="?curid=226138" title="North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco">
<text>The North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco is an American twin-turboprop light attack and observation aircraft. It was developed in the 1960s as a special aircraft for counter-insurgency (COIN) combat, and one of its primary missions was as a forward air control (FAC) aircraft. It can carry up to 3,200 lb (1,450 kg) of external munitions and internal loads such as paratroopers or stretchers, and can loiter for three or more hours.

==Development==
===Background===
The aircraft was initially conceived in the early 1960s through an informal collaboration between W.H. Beckett and Colonel K.P. Rice, U.S. Marine Corps, who met at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, California, and who also happened to live near each other. The original concept was for a rugged, simple, close-air-support aircraft integrated with forward ground operations. At the time, the U.S. Army was still experimenting with armed helicopters, and the U.S. Air Force was not interested in close air support.

The concept aircraft was to operate from expedient forward air bases using roads as runways. Speed was to be from very slow to medium subsonic, with much longer loiter times than a pure jet. Efficient turboprop engines would give better performance than piston engines. Weapons were to be mounted on the centerline to get efficient unranged aiming. The inventors favored strafing weapons such as self-loading recoilless rifles, which could deliver aimed explosive shells with less recoil than cannons, and a lower per-round weight than rockets. The airframe was to be designed to avoid the back blast.

Beckett and Rice developed a basic platform meeting these requirements, then attempted to build a fiberglass prototype in a garage. The effort produced enthusiastic supporters and an informal pamphlet describing the concept. W.H. Beckett, who had retired from the Marine Corps, went to work at North American Aviation to sell the aircraft.

Rice states:
===Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft===
A &quot;tri-service&quot; specification for the Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft (LARA) was approved by the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Army, and was issued in late 1963. The LARA requirement was based on a perceived need for a new type of &quot;jungle fighting&quot;, versatile, light attack and observation aircraft. Existing military aircraft in the observation role, such as the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog and Cessna O-2 Skymaster, were perceived as obsolescent, with too slow a speed and too small a load capacity for this flexible role.

The specification called for a twin-engined, two-man aircraft that could carry at least of cargo or six paratroopers or stretchers, and be stressed for +8 and −3 &quot;g&quot; (basic aerobatic ability). It also had to be able to operate from an aircraft carrier, fly at least , take off in , and convert to an amphibious version. Various armaments had to be carried, including four machine guns with 2,000 rounds, and external weapons including a gun pod with M197 electric cannon, and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.

Eleven proposals were submitted, including the Grumman Model 134R tandem-seat version of the already-fielded U.S. Army&#x27;s OV-1 Mohawk (the U.S. Marine Corps dropped out of the Mohawk program in 1958), Goodyear GA 39, Beechcraft PD-183, Douglas D-855, Convair Model 48 Charger, Helio 1320, Lockheed CL-760, a Martin design, and the North American Aviation/Rockwell NA-300.

In August 1964, the NA-300 was selected. A contract for seven prototype aircraft was issued in October 1964. Convair protested the decision and built a small-wing prototype of the Model 48 Charger anyway, which first flew on 29 November 1964. This was also a twin-boom aircraft that had a broadly similar layout to the OV-10. The Charger, while capable of outperforming the OV-10 in some respects, crashed on 19 October 1965 after 196 test flights. Convair subsequently dropped out of contention.
The Bronco started flying midway through the Charger&#x27;s test program on 16 July 1965, and became one of the premier COIN aircraft of the next 30 years. It did not achieve Rice&#x27;s L2 VMA concept, because the DoD insisted on 40-ft-long wings, which made it depend on airbases. Rice concludes:
The Bronco performed observation, forward air control, helicopter escort, armed reconnaissance, utility light air transport, and limited ground attack. The Bronco has also performed aerial radiological reconnaissance, tactical air observation, artillery and naval gunfire spotting, airborne control of tactical air support operations, and front-line, low-level aerial photography. A prototype in Vietnam designed to lay smoke was extremely successful, kept in service by evaluators for several months, and only reluctantly released, but was not purchased due to a perceived lack of mission.

==Design==


The OV-10 has a central nacelle containing pilots and cargo, and twin booms containing twin turboprop engines. The visually distinctive feature of the aircraft is the combination of the twin booms, with the horizontal stabilizer that connects them.

The aircraft&#x27;s design supported effective operations from forward bases. The OV-10 can perform short takeoffs and landings, including on aircraft carriers and large-deck amphibious assault ships without using catapults or arresting wires. Further, the OV-10 was designed to take off and land on unimproved sites. Repairs could be made with ordinary tools. No ground equipment was required to start the engines. If necessary, the engines could operate on high-octane automobile fuel with only a slight loss of power.

The aircraft had responsive handling and could fly for 5 1/2 hours with external fuel tanks. The cockpit had extremely good visibility for a tandem pilot and co-pilot, provided by a wrap-around &quot;greenhouse&quot; that was wider than the fuselage. North American Rockwell custom ejection seats were standard, with many successful ejections during service. With the second seat removed, it can carry of cargo, five paratroopers, or two litter patients and an attendant. Empty weight was . Normal operating fueled weight with two crew was . Maximum takeoff weight was .

The bottom of the fuselage bore sponsons or &quot;stub wings&quot; that improved flight performance by decreasing aerodynamic drag underneath the fuselage. The sponsons were mounted horizontally on the prototype. Testing caused them to be redesigned for production aircraft; the downward angle of the sponsons on production models ensured that stores carried on the sponsons jettisoned cleanly. Normally, four 7.62 mm (.308 in) M60C machine guns were carried on the sponsons with the M60Cs accessed through a large forward-opening hatch on the top of each sponson. The sponsons also had four racks to carry bombs, pods, or fuel. The wings outboard of the engines contain two additional racks, one per side.

Racked armament in the Vietnam War was usually seven-shot rocket pods with white phosphorus marker rounds or high-explosive rockets, or 5 in (127 mm) four-shot Zuni rocket pods. Bombs, ADSIDS air-delivered/para-dropped unattended seismic sensors, Mk-6 battlefield illumination flares, and other stores were also carried.

Operational experience showed some weaknesses in the OV-10&#x27;s design. It was significantly underpowered, which contributed to crashes in Vietnam in sloping terrain because the pilots could not climb fast enough. While specifications state that the aircraft could reach , in Vietnam the aircraft could reach only . Also, no OV-10 pilot survived ditching the aircraft.

==Operational history==
The OV-10 served in the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy, as well as in the service of a number of other countries. In total, 81 OV-10 Broncos were ultimately lost to all causes during the course of the Vietnam War, with the Air Force losing 64, the Navy 7, and the Marines 10.

===U.S. Marine Corps===
The OV-10 was first acquired by the U.S. Marine Corps. Each of the Marine Corps&#x27;s two observation squadrons (designated VMO) had 18 aircraft – nine OV-10As and nine OV-10Ds night observation aircraft. A Marine Air Reserve observation squadron was also established. The OV-10 operated as a forward air controller (FAC) and was finally phased out of the Marine Corps in 1995 following its employment during Operation Desert Storm, which also saw the final combat losses of OV-10s by U.S. forces. Among these losses were two USMC OV-10s being shot down due to a lack of effective infrared countermeasures. Its slow speed was thought to make it more vulnerable to antiaircraft weapons. Forward air control passed mostly to ground units with laser designators and digital radios and the twin-seat F/A-18D Hornet (FAC(A)s). Most operational Broncos were reassigned to civilian government agencies in the U.S., while some were sold to other countries.

The U.S. Marine Corps YOV-10D night observation gunship system (NOGS) program modified two OV-10As (BuNo 155395 and BuNo 155396) to include a turreted forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor, laser target designator and turreted 20 mm (.79 in) XM197 gun slaved to the FLIR aimpoint. NOGS succeeded in Vietnam, but funds to convert more aircraft were not approved. NOGS evolved into the NOS OV-10D, which included a laser designator, but no gun.

===U.S. Air Force===
The USAF acquired the Bronco primarily as an FAC aircraft. The first combat USAF OV-10As arrived in Vietnam on 31 July 1968 as part of &quot;Operation Combat Bronco&quot;, an operational testing and evaluation of the aircraft. These test aircraft were attached to the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron, 504th Tactical Air Support Group at Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. The test roles included the full range of missions then assigned to FAC aircraft, including day- and night-strike direction, gunship direction, bomb damage assessment, visual reconnaissance, aerial artillery direction, and as escorts for aircraft engaged in Operation Ranch Hand. The aircraft&#x27;s ability to generate smoke internally was used for strike direction and &quot;in four specific instances under conditions of reduced visibility, the smoke was seen by strike aircrews before the [OV-10A] [was] detected.&quot; Operation Combat Bronco ended on 30 October 1968.

After the end of Combat Bronco, the USAF began to deploy larger numbers to the 19th TASS (Bien Hoa), 20th TASS (Da Nang Air Base), and for out-of-country missions to the 23d TASS (Nakhom Phanom in Thailand). The 23d TASS conducted Operation Igloo White, Operation Prairie Fire/Daniel Boone, and other special operations missions.

Between 1968 and 1971, 26 pilots from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) flew the OV-10A on FAC sorties, while attached to USAF squadrons. The 19th TASS hosted 13 RAAF pilots and three from the RNZAF; another seven RAAF pilots and three from the RNZAF were assigned to the 20th TASS. (Consequently, the Australian War Memorial has acquired an OV-10A &quot;67-14639&quot;, which was flown by some of these pilots.)
From April to June 1969, the USAF conducted an operational exercise called &quot;Misty Bronco&quot; in South Vietnam&#x27;s III Corps tactical zone to evaluate the OV-10A&#x27;s performance as a light strike aircraft. The results were positive, and as of October 1969, all USAF OV-10As were to be armed with their internal .308 in (7.62 mm) M60C machine guns, which had generally been left out during the Combat Bronco evaluations and subsequent deployment. High-explosive 2.75 in (70 mm) rockets were also authorized for use against ground targets.

In 1971, the 23d TASS&#x27;s OV-10A Broncos received modifications under project Pave Nail. Carried out by LTV Electrosystems during 1970, these modifications primarily included the addition of the Pave Spot target laser designator pod, and a specialized night periscope (replacing the initial starlight scopes that had been used for night operations) and LORAN equipment. The call sign &quot;Nail&quot; was the radio handle of this squadron. These aircraft supported interdiction of troops and supplies on the Ho Chi Minh Trail by illuminating targets for laser-guided bombs dropped by McDonnell F-4 Phantom IIs. After 1974, these aircraft were converted back to an unmodified OV-10A standard.

At least 157 OV-10As were delivered to the USAF before production ended in April 1969. The USAF lost 64 OV-10 Broncos during the war, to all causes. In the late 1980s, the USAF started to replace their OV-10s with OA-37B and OA-10A aircraft. Unlike the Marine Corps, the USAF did not deploy the Bronco to the Middle East in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as it believed that the OV-10 was too vulnerable. The final two USAF squadrons equipped with the Bronco, the 19th and 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron (TASS) retired the OV-10 on 1 September 1991.

In 2012, $20 million were allocated to activate an experimental unit of two OV-10s, acquired from NASA and the State Department. Starting in May 2015, these aircraft were deployed to support Operation Inherent Resolve flying combat missions over Iraq and Syria, flying more than 120 combat sorties over 82 days. They reportedly provided close air support for Special Forces missions. The experiment ended satisfactorily, but an Air Force spokesman stated they are unlikely to invest in reactivating the OV-10 on a regular basis because of the overhead cost of operating an additional aircraft type.

===U.S. Navy===
The U.S. Navy formed Light Attack Squadron Four (VAL-4), the &quot;Black Ponies&quot;, on 3 January 1969, and operated in Vietnam from April 1969 to April 1972. The Navy used the Bronco OV-10A as a light ground-attack aircraft, for interdiction of enemy logistics, and fire support of Marines, SEALs, and naval riverine force vessels. It succeeded in this role, although the U.S. Navy did lose seven OV-10s during the war to various causes. Other than OV-10 fleet replacement training done in cooperation with Air Antisubmarine Squadron 41 (VS-41) at NAS North Island, California, VAL-4 was the only squadron in the U.S. Navy to ever employ the OV-10, and it was decommissioned shortly following the end of the Vietnam War. VAL-4&#x27;s surviving OV-10s were subsequently transferred to the Marine Corps.

At least two Broncos were used as test beds in the 1970s at the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. 

Two OV-10s were evaluated for special operations, and the USMC lent 18 aircraft for operation by VAL-4 in Vietnam.

In 2015, two OV-10Gs were assigned for light attack operations in Iraq under the &quot;Combat Dragon II&quot; program and completed 120 missions.
In 2019, the first of two former VAL-4 aircraft returned to flight by the OV-10 Squadron, Chino, California. Bureau numbers 155493 &quot;Holy Terror&quot; and 155474 &quot;White Lightning&quot;. Extensive restoration work of more than 18 months performed by California Aerofab went into 493&#x27;s return to flight and 155474 expected to fly by 2020.

===Colombia===
In 1991, the USAF provided the Colombian Air Force with 12 OV-10As. Later, three ex-USMC A-models were also acquired to provide parts support. Colombia operates the aircraft in a COIN role against an active insurgency. At least one aircraft has been lost in combat. The remaining OV-10As were upgraded to OV-10D standard. In November 2015, and after 24 years of service, the Colombian Air Force retired all of its remaining OV-10 aircraft.

===Germany===
The OV-10B variant was produced for Germany to use as target tug. Eighteen aircraft were delivered in the late 1960s and they were equipped with target towing equipment inside the fuselage. A transparent plastic dome replaced the rear cargo door and a rear seat was installed in the cargo bay to look backwards out of the dome. After a long career the Bronco was replaced by the Pilatus PC-9 in 1990 and all aircraft were retired and sent to various museums, technical schools, and used in aircraft battle damage repair.

===Indonesia===

The Indonesian Air Force purchased 16 OV-10F aircraft in 1976. The aircraft were ferried across the Pacific Ocean from Wright-Patterson AFB to the Halim Perdanakusuma Airport via Alaska, Aleutians, Midway, Wake Island, Guam, and Clark Field. They were operated in COIN operations similar to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Vietnam missions with their Broncos, but retrofitted .50 in (12.7 mm) Browning heavy machine guns in place of the .308 in (7.62 mm) machine guns. These aircraft were based in Abdulrachman Saleh Air Force Base in Malang, East Java.

In October 1976, three OV-10F were deployed to the Penfui Airport in West Timor, starting its vital career in the invasion of East Timor and ensuing COIN operations. During the operations in East Timor, the OV-10F flight were given the callsign &quot;Kampret&quot; (microbat). Starting in February 1977, up to six OV-10F were based at Dili Airport, with Baucau Airport serving as frontline airbase. During its initial years, the Indonesian Air Force modified the aircraft bomb racks to carry Soviet-made bombs and rockets as a stopgap measure, as U.S.-supplied bombs would only be received in early 1980. During its 23 years of operation in East Timor, two OV-10F were lost in non-combat accidents, with two went missing and one killed.

In 1977, the OV-10Fs were used during the aerial bombardments of Amungme villages near Freeport-McMoRan area of operations, West Papua, in response to OPM attacks on the mining company facilities, and of Dani villages in Baliem Valley, also in West Papua, in response to rebellion against enforced participation in the Indonesian general election.

At the start of the 2003–2004 Indonesian offensive in Aceh on 19–20 May 2003, the OV-10Fs were providing air support for airborne landings in Banda Aceh and Takengon.

The Indonesian Air Force grounded their OV-10Fs following a fatal accident on 23 July 2007. They were replaced by Embraer Super Tucanos in 2012.

===Morocco===
The Royal Moroccan Air Force acquired six former U.S. Marine Corps OV-10As in 1981, which were flown to Morocco from Columbus, Ohio, via Canada, Greenland, and Iceland. They were accompanied by fifteen US Marines from VMO-1 and VMO-2, who formed a mobile training team. The aircraft were based in Marrakesh Menara Airport, where they were employed in COIN operations against Polisario forces in the Western Sahara War using rocket pods and gun pods. One was shot down in 1985, with the loss of its pilot.

===Philippines===

The Philippine Air Force (PAF) received 24 OV-10As from U.S. stocks in 1991, later followed by a further nine from the United States, and eight ex-Thai Air Force OV-10Cs in 2003–2004. The OV-10s are operated by the 16th Attack Squadron and 25th Composite Attack Squadron of the 15th Strike Wing, based in Sangley Point, Cavite. The PAF flies Broncos on search-and-rescue and COIN operations in various parts of the Philippines. The first two women combat pilots in the PAF flew OV-10s with the 16th. This squadron flew anti-terrorist operations in the Jolo island.

PAF OV-10 Broncos were repeatedly used in air strikes against Moro Islamic Liberation Front positions during ongoing fighting in 2011, and two were used in an air strike in February 2012, which resulted in the death of three Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah commanders, among others. Philippine Air Force OV-10s have been reportedly modified in order to employ modern smart bombs.

On 1 June 2017, the PAF OV-10s dropped bombs on Maute group positions during the Battle of Marawi.

The PAF announced that its remaining OV-10s will be replaced by the Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano by 2024. This is to meet requirements set by the AFP Modernization Act to replace the aging aircraft. The OV-10s had finally withdrawn from service on 28 December 2024.

===Thailand===

The Royal Thai Air Force purchased 32 new OV-10C aircraft in the early 1970s for COIN usage. Reportedly, Broncos won most Thai bombing competitions until F-5Es became operational. At one time, the RTAF flew OV-10s as air-defense aircraft. In 2004, RTAF donated most of the OV-10s to the Philippines. Three OV-10 survivors are displayed, one at the Tango Squadron Wing 41 Museum in Chiang Mai, the RTAF Museum in Bangkok, and a static display at the main gate of Wing 5 in Prachuap Khiri Khan. The remaining OV-10s were to be donated to the PAF in 2011.

===Venezuela===
The Venezuelan Air Force has operated a number of new-build OV-10Es and ex-USAF OV-10As over the years. On 27 November 1992, the aircraft were widely used by mutinous officers who staged an attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against former President Carlos Andrés Pérez. The rebels dropped bombs and launched rockets against police and government buildings in Caracas. Four Broncos were lost during the uprising, including two shot down by a loyalist General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon.

Venezuela&#x27;s OV-10s are to be retired in the coming years. Originally, Venezuela attempted to procure Embraer Super Tucano aircraft to replace the OV-10, but no deal was achieved, which President Chavez claimed was due to the result of pressure from the U.S. government. The Venezuelan government has decided not to replace them with new fixed wing aircraft. Rather, the Venezuelan Air Force is replacing them with the Russian made Mil Mi-28 attack helicopter.

===Other U.S. usage===

====NASA====
NASA has used a number of Broncos for various research programs, including studies of low-speed flight carried out with the third prototype in the 1970s, and studies on noise and wake turbulence. One OV-10 remained in use at NASA&#x27;s Langley base in 2009 with three additional aircraft obtained from the Department of State formerly used in drug-eradication efforts.

====U.S. Department of State Air Wing====
The Department of State (DoS) aircraft are former Air Force OV-10A and Marine Corps OV-10D aircraft operated under contract by DynCorp International in support of U.S. drug interdiction and eradication efforts in South America. The aircraft carry civilian U.S. aircraft registration numbers, and when not forward deployed, are home based at a DoS/DynCorp facility at Patrick Space Force Base, Florida.

The Broncos had sponsons removed and Kevlar external armor panels installed around the cockpits. On the belly was a wind-driven pump adapted from Agriculture Aircraft (crop dusters) with more than a 500 gal (1,900 L) hopper tank installed in the cargo bay. A spray bar extended out to a V from the cargo bay to the tailbooms. A surviving aircraft in this configuration is on display in Tennessee.

====Bureau of Land Management====
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) acquired seven OV-10As for use as fire-fighting aircraft, including the YOV-10A prototype. In this role, they lead firefighting air tankers through their intended flight paths over their target areas. The aircraft were operated in their basic military configurations, but with their ejection seats disabled. The aircraft&#x27;s existing smoke system was used to mark the path for the following air tankers. Given the age of the aircraft, spare parts were difficult to obtain, and the BLM retired their fleet in 1999.

====California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection====
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CALFIRE) has acquired a number of OV-10As, including the six surviving aircraft from the BLM and 13 former U.S. Marine Corps aircraft in 1993 to replace their existing Cessna O-2 Skymasters as air-attack aircraft. The CAL FIRE Broncos fly with a crew of two, a contract pilot and the CAL FIRE ATGS or Air Tactical Group Supervisor, whose job it is to coordinate all aerial assets on a fire with the Incident Commander on the ground. Thus, besides serving as a tanker lead-in aircraft, the OV-10A is also the aerial platform from which the entire air operation is coordinated.

==Variants==
;YOV-10A
:Seven prototype NA-300s with two 600 shp T76-G-6/8 engines, last one was flown with YT74-P-1 engines.
;OV-10A
:Original production version with enlarged wing and 715 shp T76-G-10/12 engines. Distinguished by a long-wire high frequency (HF) antenna between the center rear stabilizer and the central nacelle, 114 for the United States Marine Corps and 157 for the United States Air Force.
;OV-10B
:Target towing variant for Germany, with a target towing pod mounted beneath the fuselage. A clear dome replaced the rear cargo door. The rear seat was moved to the cargo bay to look backwards out the dome, 18 built; known as the OV-10B(Z) when fitted with an additional J85-GE-4 turbojet. 
;OV-10B(Z)
:A variation of the German target tug, with one J85-GE-4 turbojet mounted in a nacelle above the fuselage. A total of 18 aircraft were supplied to the Germans.
;OV-10C
:Export version for Thailand; based on the OV-10A, 32 built.
;YOV-10D (NOGS)
:The prototype Night Observation Gunship System variant developed as the YOV-10D, two OV-10A conversions, 155395,155396.

;OV-10D
:Second generation Bronco developed under the NOGS program. The D-model was an extensively modified OV-10A airframe, adding a forward-looking infrared night-vision system with a turret-mounted camera under an extended nose, visually distinct from the short rounded nose of the A-model. The D also has bigger engines and larger fiberglass propellers. Other noticeable external differences are the chaff dispensers installed midway down the booms and infrared-suppressive exhaust stacks (which mix the exhaust with colder air to reduce the aircraft&#x27;s heat signature). 17 modified from OV-10A.
;OV-10D+
:The next USMC upgrade, consisting of A and D aircraft being extensively reworked at MCAS Cherry Point Naval Air Rework Facility with new wiring and strengthened wings. Engine instrumentation was changed from round dials to tape readouts.
;OV-10E
:Export version for Venezuela; based on the OV-10A, 16 built.
;OV-10F
:Export version for Indonesia; based on the OV-10A, 16 built.
;OV-10G+
:Designation given to OV-10s loaned from NASA to the United States Special Operations Command for evaluation under the Combat Dragon II as a counter-insurgency aircraft, featuring new Hartzell four-bladed props and an off-the-shelf sensor suite. 3 modified from OV-10D+.
;OV-10M (modified)
:A four-bladed version of OV-10A; modified to accommodate bigger engines with larger fiberglass props. Equipped with square chaff dispensers midway down the booms and with new wiring and strengthened wings. Engine instrumentation was changed from round dials to tape readouts by Marsh Aviation for the Philippine Air Force. Capability to deliver GBU-12 Paveway II and GBU-49 Enhanced Paveway II smart bombs were integrated in 2012.

;OV-10T
:Proposed cargo version of the OV-10, capable of carrying 8–12 troops or of cargo, studied during the Vietnam War but not developed.

;OV-10X
:Proposed version for the USAF&#x27;s Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance contract. In 2009 Boeing put together plans internally to build a modernized, improved version of the Bronco, called the OV-10X, to satisfy a possible Air Force requirement for a light attack plane. According to Pentagon and industry officials, while the aircraft would maintain much of its 1960s-vintage rugged external design, modernizations would include a computerized glass cockpit, intelligence sensors and smart bomb-dropping capabilities. Boeing indicated in 2009 that international interest in restarting production is growing, to compete with other light attack aircraft such as the T-6B Texan II, A-67 Dragon and EMB 314 Super Tucano.

<text>The position of secretary of state for dominion affairs was a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, responsible for British relations with the Empire’s dominions – Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, and the Irish Free State – and the self-governing Crown colony of Southern Rhodesia.

When initially created in 1925, the office was held in tandem with that of Secretary of State for the Colonies; this arrangement persisted until June 1930. On two subsequent occasions the offices were briefly held by the same person.

The secretary of state was supported by an Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. In 1947, the name of the office was changed to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.

&quot;The Viscount Addison took up the new post of Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations on 7 July 1947.&quot;

<text>The secretary of state for Commonwealth relations was a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, responsible for dealing with the United Kingdom&#x27;s relations with members of the Commonwealth of Nations (its former colonies). The minister&#x27;s department was the Commonwealth Relations Office (CRO).

The position was created in 1947 out of the old positions of Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and Secretary of State for India. In 1966, the position was merged with that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies to form that of Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs, which was in turn merged with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1968 to create the new position of Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The equivalent position today is the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs.

<text>The secretary of state for commonwealth affairs was a British Cabinet minister responsible for dealing with the United Kingdom&#x27;s relations with members of the Commonwealth of Nations (its former colonies). The minister&#x27;s department was the Commonwealth Office.

The position was created on 1 August 1966 by the merger of the old positions of secretary of state for commonwealth relations and secretary of state for the colonies. In 1968 the position was merged with that of secretary of state for foreign affairs to create the new position of Foreign Secretary.

<text>Arthur Freed (September 9, 1894 – April 12, 1973) was an American lyricist and a Hollywood film producer. He won the Academy Award for Best Picture twice, in 1951 for &quot;An American in Paris&quot; and in 1958 for &quot;Gigi&quot;. Both films were musicals, and both were directed by Vincente Minnelli. In addition, he produced the film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, the soundtrack for which primarily consisted of songs he co-wrote earlier in his career.
Shirley Temple accused him of exposing himself to her when she was a child.

==Early life==
Freed was born to a Jewish family in Charleston, South Carolina, and wrote poetry while a high schooler at Phillips Exeter Academy. After graduating in 1914, he began his career as a song-plugger and pianist in Chicago. After meeting Minnie Marx, he sang as part of the act of her sons, the Marx Brothers, on the vaudeville circuit, and also wrote material for the brothers.

He soon began to write songs, and he was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. For years, he wrote lyrics for numerous films, many set to music by Nacio Herb Brown.

==Career==
In 1939, after working (uncredited) in the role of associate producer on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, he was promoted to being the head of his own unit within MGM, and helped elevate the studio to the leading creator of film musicals. His first solo credit as producer was the film version of Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s smash Broadway musical &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; (also 1939), released only a few months after &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. It starred Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, and it was so successful that it ushered in a long series of &quot;let&#x27;s put on a show&quot; &quot;backyard&quot; musicals, all starring Rooney and Garland.

Freed brought talent from the Broadway theaters to the MGM soundstages including Vincente Minnelli, Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Roger Edens, Kay Thompson, Zero Mostel, June Allyson, Nancy Walker, Charles Walters, orchestrators Conrad Salinger, Johnny Green, Lennie Hayton, and others including Shirley Temple.

He also helped shape the careers of stars including Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Red Skelton, Lena Horne, Jane Powell, Esther Williams, Kathryn Grayson, Howard Keel, Cyd Charisse, Ann Miller, Vera-Ellen, and others. He brought Fred Astaire to MGM after Astaire&#x27;s tenure at RKO and coaxed him out of semi-retirement to star with Garland in &quot;Easter Parade&quot;. His team of writers, directors, composers and stars produced a steady stream of popular, critically acclaimed musicals until the late 1950s.

He allowed his directors and choreographers free rein, something unheard of in those days of committee-produced film musicals, and is credited for furthering the boundaries of film musicals by allowing such moments in films as the fifteen-minute ballet at the end of &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), after which the film concludes moments later with no more dialogue or songs, and he allowed the musical team of Lerner and Loewe complete control in their writing of &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958).

According to Hugh Fordin&#x27;s book &quot;The World of Entertainment&quot;, Freed did have a hand in the stage-to-screen adaptation of the 1951 Technicolor remake of Kern and Hammerstein&#x27;s stage classic, &quot;Show Boat&quot;. It was Freed who disagreed with the original structure of the show&#x27;s second act, in which more than 20 years pass between most of the act and the final three scenes of the musical. He felt that it made for a lack of drama in the story, and with screenwriter John Lee Mahin, Freed hit upon the idea of having the gambler Gaylord Ravenal leave his wife Magnolia while both are still young and Magnolia is expecting a baby, and then having Julie, the half-black actress who is forced to leave the boat because of her mixed-race background, be the person who brings Ravenal and Magnolia back together again after a separation of only a few years rather than twenty. Also, Freed cast Ava Gardner in the role of Julie.

Two of his films won the Academy Award for Best Picture: &quot;An American in Paris&quot; and &quot;Gigi&quot;. On the night that &quot;An American in Paris&quot; won Best Picture, Freed received an Honorary Oscar, and his version of &quot;Show Boat&quot; was up for two Oscars that year. The year 1951, in which Freed won the Academy Award for Best Picture for &quot;Paris&quot;, was the first year that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated producers by name rather than by studio. He was the only person nominated for &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, thus being the first person in the history of the award to win by name rather than by studio. &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), now his most highly regarded film, won no Oscars. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972.

==Shirley Temple allegations==
Shirley Temple wrote in her 1988 autobiography that when aged 12 she was interviewed by Freed with a view to transferring her career to MGM. She wrote that during the interview, Freed unzipped his trousers and exposed himself to her. &quot;Being innocent of male anatomy, she responded by giggling, and he threw her out of his office&quot;, said the actress&#x27;s obituary. She also reported this claim on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; when interviewed on October 25, 1988, further alleging that Louis B. Mayer sexually propositioned her mother in an adjacent room during this incident. Temple stated these are the reasons she left MGM after only one film and returned to Fox.

==Retirement and later years==
Freed left MGM in 1961. He served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences until leaving in 1966. He died of a heart attack on April 3, 1973.

<text>The Secretary of State for the Northern Department was a position in the Cabinet of the government of Great Britain up to 1782. Then the Northern Department became the Foreign Office and the position evolved into the Foreign Secretary.

==History==
Before the Act of Union, 1707, the Secretary of State&#x27;s responsibilities were in relation to the English government, not the British. Even after the Union, there was still a separate Secretary of State for Scotland until 1746, though the post was sometimes vacant. This continued the previous Scottish government post of Secretary of State.

Before 1782, the responsibilities of the two Secretaries of State for the Northern and the Southern Departments were not divided up in terms of area of authority, but rather geographically. The Secretary of State for the Northern Department was responsible for relations with the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, and the Holy Roman Empire. The Secretary of State for the Southern Department was responsible for Ireland, the Channel Islands, France, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, the Italian states, and the Ottoman Empire. He was also responsible for the American colonies until 1768, when the charge was given to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Domestic responsibilities in England and Wales were shared between the two Secretaries. After the union with Scotland in 1707, the two secretaries also took responsibility for Scotland when there was no Secretary of State for Scotland in office.

Until 1706, the practice was generally for the senior official to lead the Southern Department, and the junior the Northern Department, with the Northern Secretary being transferred to the Southern Department when a vacancy arose at the latter. During the reigns of George I and George II, however, the Northern Department began to be seen as the more important, since its responsibilities included the monarchs&#x27; ancestral home of Hanover. During the reign of George III, the two departments were of approximately equal importance.

In 1782, the two Secretaries of State were reformed as the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
During the 18th century, Secretaries of State for the Northern Department, if peers, were often Leaders of the House of Lords as well.

==History==
Before 1782, the responsibilities of the two British Secretaries of State for the Northern and the Southern departments were divided not based on the principles of modern ministerial divisions, but geographically. The Secretary of State for the Southern Department was responsible for Ireland, the Channel Islands, France, Spain, Portugal, the Old Swiss Confederacy, the states of Italy, and the Ottoman Empire. He was also responsible for the American colonies until 1768, when the charge was given to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

<doc id="226147" wikidata="Q2074600" url="?curid=226147" title="Dell Inspiron">
<text>Inspiron ( , formerly stylized as inspiron) was a line of consumer-oriented laptop computers, desktop computers and all-in-one computers sold by Dell. The Inspiron range mainly competes against Acer&#x27;s Aspire; Asus&#x27;s Transformer Book Flip, VivoBook and Zenbook; HP&#x27;s Pavilion, Stream, and ENVY; Lenovo&#x27;s IdeaPad; Samsung&#x27;s Sens; and Toshiba&#x27;s Satellite.
In January 2025, Dell announced its intentions to retire the Inspiron brand (along with the XPS and Latitude lines) in favor of a singular brand that emphasizes the &quot;Dell&quot; name as part of the company&#x27;s preparation for their next-generation AI PCs. Other brands such as HP have also done a similar practice, with HP retiring most of their other brands (such as the Pavilion and Spectre) in May 2024 in favor of a singular &quot;Omni&quot; brand for their own line of AI PCs.

== Types ==
The Dell Inspiron lineup consists of laptops, traditional desktops, and all-in-one desktops.

*Dell Inspiron laptop computers
*Dell Inspiron desktop computers
*Dell Inspiron All-in-One
Discontinued:
*Dell Inspiron Mini Series netbooks (2008-2010)

== Controversy ==

Dell was the subject of a class action lawsuit in 2005 over some of their Inspiron laptops (models affected include the 1100, 1150, 5100, 5150, and 5160). The suit was filed in September 2005, and was officially settled between December 2006 and January 2007, in what is known as the Lundell Settlement. There were a number of design flaws in this model, ranging from flaws in the cooling system of the notebook to a tab on the &quot;C&quot; panel pressing on the motherboard. In all, the design flaws caused the notebook to shut down suddenly or not to boot at all. The suit had been filed in Ontario, Canada; claimants said that the laptops suffered premature motherboard failures caused by overheating shortly after the warranty period had ended.

<doc id="226150" wikidata="Q1507895" url="?curid=226150" title="Moaning Lisa (The Simpsons)">
<text>&quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; is the sixth episode of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on February 11, 1990. The episode was written by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, and was directed by Wes Archer. Ron Taylor guest stars in the episode as Oscar &quot;Bleeding Gums&quot; Murphy. The episode deals with Lisa&#x27;s depression and her attempts to sublimate it by playing her saxophone.

==Plot==
Lisa wakes up one morning saddened. At school, she gets in trouble with her music teacher for improvising and becomes reluctant to play dodgeball in gym. At home, Homer and Bart pummel each other at video boxing, but despite Homer&#x27;s attempts, he is unable to defeat Bart. 

Homer and Marge try to cheer Lisa up, but she is consumed with existentialism and worry over all the suffering in the world. In her room, Lisa hears music coming from outside her window. She follows the music through town and meets Oscar &quot;Bleeding Gums&quot; Murphy, a soulful saxophonist playing the blues. Lisa learns about expressing herself through her music from him, only to be discovered and whisked away by Marge.

Homer goes to the arcade and enlists the help of an arcade boxing expert, while Marge, who is still upset at Lisa for sneaking out the night before, takes her to band practice. She tells Lisa to smile no matter how she feels inside, to suppress her emotions to be popular, and that happiness will follow. 

But when she sees Lisa hiding her true feelings and being taken advantage of by her classmates and her music teacher, Marge changes her tune and tells Lisa to be herself. Her support helps Lisa to feel genuinely happy. When Homer returns home, he is about to defeat Bart in a rematch but Marge unplugs the game console to announce Lisa&#x27;s recovery, while Bart declares his retirement as an undefeated video boxing champ. Later, the Simpsons visit a jazz club to hear Bleeding Gums Murphy sing a blues number written by Lisa.

==Production==
&quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; was the first episode of the series to focus on the character of Lisa Simpson. The idea for it was suggested by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; producer James L. Brooks, who wanted to do an episode where Lisa was sad but she did not know why. The writers also felt they had done several &quot;jokey&quot; episodes on the show and wanted to try something new that was &quot;really emotional and sweet&quot;. 

While writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss were initially thrilled to write an episode pitched by Brooks, for whom they had deep admiration, they were unsure that the depression-themed episode would work. Series creator Matt Groening taunted the pair for having been assigned the episode, while producer Sam Simon told them that Brooks had been trying to get such an episode made since &quot;Taxi&quot;. According to Reiss, the episode establishes Lisa as a character, as in his and Jean&#x27;s previous episode &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;, she is as badly behaved as Bart.

The song Lisa sings in this episode later reappeared in expanded form on &quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot; CD. Mr. Largo, Lisa&#x27;s music teacher, was partly inspired by a music teacher Groening had as a child. The designs of the boxers in the video game Homer and Bart play were loosely based on Homer and Bart, and the referee in the game was based on a character from Matt Groening&#x27;s &quot;Life in Hell&quot; comic strip. &quot;Bleeding Gums&quot; Murphy was loosely based on the famous blues musician Blind Lemon Jefferson. Ralph Wiggum, &quot;Bleeding Gums&quot; Murphy, and Jacqueline Bouvier (during Marge&#x27;s childhood flashback) all make their first (going by production order rather than airdate) appearances on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in this episode.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; finished 34th place in the weekly ratings for the week of February 5–11, 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 13.8. It was the highest-rated show on Fox that week.

The authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: &quot;Certain scenes of this, the most syrupy of &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes, sent viewers raised on the later seasons scurrying to the bathroom. Yes, the final moments may give you goosepimples, and are a world away from the anti-schmaltz normally associated with the series, but there is still much to recommend here. In fact, the Homer–Bart subplot is more successful than the main storyline; Homer&#x27;s nightmare about their relationship is genuinely disturbing.&quot;

In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated the episode a (of 5) and added: &quot;Lisa develops much of her future personality in this episode. The family dynamic is starting to fall into place, as is the relationship between Homer and Lisa.&quot;

Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that &quot;overall, this was a pretty drab episode&quot; and added that &quot;it had some moments, such as the videogame boxing matches between Homer and Bart, but Lisa lacked the strength at this point to carry an entire show&quot;.

Yeardley Smith, the voice actress of Lisa, has cited the episode as one of her favorite &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes of all time.

In his 2018 memoir &quot;Springfield Confidential&quot;, Mike Reiss named the episode as one of four that broke new ground, alongside &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot;, &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; and the original &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot;.

==Home media==
The episode was released first on home video in the United Kingdom, as part of a VHS release titled &quot;The Simpsons Collection&quot;; the episode was paired with season one episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;. It was released in the US on the VHS release &quot;The Best of The Simpsons, Vol. 2&quot; (1997), paired with &quot;Bart the General&quot;. In the United States, it was later re released in a collector&#x27;s edition boxed set of the first three volumes of &quot;The Best of The Simpsons&quot; collections.

In the United Kingdom, it was re released as part of a VHS boxed set of the complete first season, in November 1999. The episode&#x27;s début on the DVD format was as a part of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season one DVD set, which was released on September 25, 2001. Groening, Reiss, Archer, and Jean participated in the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary. A digital edition of the series&#x27; first season, including the episode, was published December 20, 2010 in the United States through Amazon Video and iTunes.

The bank was founded on April 24, 1917 in Ballard, Washington as Ballard Savings and Loan by a group of businessmen. In 1958, it merged with Washington Federal Savings and Loan Association of Bothell. The bank took the name Washington Federal for &quot;wider geographical acceptance&quot;.

The bank demutualized in 1982 and the present holding company structure was adopted in 1995.

In 2019, the bank was rebranded as WaFd Bank (pronounced Wah-Fed), a long-used nickname for the bank.

<doc id="226158" wikidata="Q209690" url="?curid=226158" title="Sir">
<text>Sir is a formal honorific address in English for men, derived from Sire in the High Middle Ages. Both are derived from the old French &quot; (Lord), brought to England by the French-speaking Normans, and which now exist in French only as part of &quot;, with the equivalent &quot;My Lord&quot; in English. 

Traditionally, as governed by law and custom, Sir is used for men who are knights and belong to certain orders of chivalry, as well as later applied to baronets and other offices. 

As the female equivalent for knighthood is damehood, the &quot;suo jure&quot; female equivalent term is typically Dame. The wife of a knight or baronet tends to be addressed as Lady, although a few exceptions and interchanges of these uses exist.

Additionally, since the late modern period, Sir has been used as a respectful way to address a man of superior social status or military rank. Equivalent terms of address for women are Madam (shortened to Ma&#x27;am), in addition to social honorifics such as Mrs, Ms, or Miss.

==Etymology==
&quot;Sir&quot; derives from the honorific title &quot;sire&quot;; &quot;sire&quot; developed alongside the word &quot;seigneur&quot;, also used to refer to a feudal lord. Both derived from the Vulgar Latin , &quot;sire&quot; comes from the nominative case declension and &quot;seigneur&quot;, the accusative case declension .

The form &#x27;Sir&#x27; is first documented in English in 1297, as the title of honour of a knight, and latterly a baronet, being a variant of &quot;sire&quot;, which was already used in English since at least (after 139 years of Norman rule) as a title placed before a name and denoting knighthood, and to address the (male) Sovereign since , with additional general senses of &#x27;father, male parent&#x27; is from , and &#x27;important elderly man&#x27; from 1362.

==Entitlement to formal honorific address by region==

===Commonwealth of Nations===

The prefix is used with the holder&#x27;s given name or full name, but never with the surname alone. For example, whilst Sir Alexander and Sir Alexander Fleming would be correct, Sir Fleming would not.
Today, in the UK and in certain Commonwealth realms, a number of men are entitled to the prefix of &#x27;Sir&#x27;, including knights bachelor, knights of the orders of chivalry and baronets; although foreign nationals can be awarded honorary knighthoods. Honorary knights do not bear the prefix &quot;Sir&quot; nor do they receive an accolade; instead they use the associated post-nominal letters.

Only citizens of Commonwealth realms may receive substantive knighthoods and have the privilege of the accompanying style. In general, only knighthoods in dynastic orders – those orders in the personal gift of the Sovereign and Head of the Commonwealth (the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the knighthoods in the Royal Victorian Order) – are recognised across the Commonwealth realms, along with their accompanying styles.

British knighthoods (in the Orders of the Bath, St. Michael and St. George, and in the Order of the British Empire, along with Knights Bachelor) were known as &quot;imperial honours&quot; during the existence of the British Empire. Those honours continued to be conferred as substantive, not honorary, awards by most Commonwealth realms into the 1990s. Since then, though former imperial honours are still awarded by certain Commonwealth realms, many of them have discontinued grants of British honours as they have developed their own honours systems, some of which include knighthoods. Today, British honours are only substantive for British nationals so recognised, including dual nationals, and for nationals of those realms which have retained them as part of their honours systems.

Dual national recipients of British knighthoods who hold British citizenship, such as academic and immunologist Sir John Bell, are entitled to the style of &quot;Sir&quot; as their knighthoods are substantive. This may not necessarily be the case for dual nationals who are not British citizens and who instead hold citizenship of another Commonwealth realm. In 1974, Lynden Pindling, the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, recommended dual Bahamian-American citizen Sidney Poitier for an honorary knighthood as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), an imperial honour, as the Bahamas did not have its own honours system at the time. Although Poitier, as a Bahamian citizen by descent, was eligible for a substantive (&#x27;ordinary&#x27;) award of the KBE, the Bahamian government preferred the knighthood to be honorary as Poitier was permanently residing in the United States. Knighthoods in the gift of the government of a Commonwealth realm only permit the bearer to use his style within that country or as its official representative, provided he is a national of that country; knighthoods granted by other realms may be considered foreign honours. For instance, Anthony Bailey was reprimanded by Buckingham Palace and the British government in 2016 for asserting that an honorary Antiguan knighthood (which was revoked in 2017) allowed him the style of &#x27;Sir&#x27; in the UK.

The equivalent for a female who holds a knighthood or baronetcy in her own right is &#x27;Dame&#x27;, and follows the same usage customs as &#x27;Sir&#x27;. Although this form was previously also used for the wives of knights and baronets, it is now customary to refer to them as &#x27;Lady&#x27;, followed by their surname; they are never addressed using their full names. For example, while Lady Fiennes is correct, Lady Virginia and Lady Virginia Fiennes are not. The widows of knights retain the style of wives of knights, however widows of baronets are either referred to as &#x27;dowager&#x27;, or use their forename before their courtesy style. For example, the widow of Sir Thomas Herbert Cochrane Troubridge, 4th Baronet, would either be known as &quot;Dowager Lady Troubridge&quot; or &quot;Laura, Lady Troubridge&quot;.

====Barbados====
Prior to becoming a republic in November 2021, Barbados awarded the title Knight or Dame of St. Andrew within the Order of Barbados. This practice has now been discontinued, though individuals who received a knighthood or damehood when the country was still a Commonwealth realm may continue to use the titles &quot;Sir&quot; and &quot;Dame&quot; within their lifetimes.

====India====
As part of the consolidation of the crown colony of India, the Order of the Star of India was established in 1861 to reward prominent British and Indian civil servants, military officers and prominent Indians associated with the Indian Empire. The Order of the Indian Empire was established in 1878 as a junior-level order to accompany the Order of the Star of India, and to recognise long service.

From 1861 to 1866, the Order of the Star of India had a single class of Knights (KSI), who were entitled to the style of &#x27;Sir&#x27;. In 1866, the order was reclassified into three divisions: Knights Grand Commander (GCSI), Knights Commander (KCSI) and Companions (CSI); holders of the upper two degrees could use the title &#x27;Sir&#x27;. From its creation in 1878 until 1887, the Order of the Indian Empire had a single class, Companion (CIE), which did not entitle the recipient to a style of knighthood.

In 1887, two higher divisions, Knight Grand Commander (GCIE) and Knight Commander (KCIE) were created, which entitled holders of those ranks to the style of &#x27;Sir&#x27;. The last creations of knights of either order were made on 15 August 1947 upon Indian independence. All British honours and their accompanying styles were officially made obsolete in India when the Dominion of India became a modern republic in the Commonwealth of Nations in 1950, followed by Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956.

The Order of the Star of India became dormant in the Commonwealth realms from February 2009, and the Order of the Indian Empire after August 2010, when the last knights of the orders died.

In Nigeria, holders of religious honours like the Knighthood of St. Gregory make use of the word as a pre-nominal honorific in much the same way as it is used for secular purposes in Britain and the Philippines. Wives of such individuals also typically assume the title of Lady.

=== Non-Commonwealth Countries ===

=== Holy See ===
Knights and Dames of papal orders may elect the &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot; prefix with post-nominal letters, subject to the laws and conventions of the country they are in. The Pope, the sovereign of the Catholic Church and Vatican City, delegates the awarding orders of knighthood to bishops and Grand Masters. Their precedence is as follows:

* Supreme Order of Christ (Vacant)
* Order of the Golden Spur (Vacant)
* Order of Pope Pius IX
* Order of St. Gregory the Great
* Order of St. Sylvester
* Order of the Holy Sepulchre
* Sovereign Military Order of Malta

For Example, Sir Burton P. C. Hall, KSS, KCHS would be the correct style for lay knights.

Lieutenants of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, are styled as &quot;Your Excellency&quot;, such as H.E. Dame Trudy Comeau, DC*HS.

Catholic clergy who are invested as Knight Chaplains may use post-nominal letters, but must retain their clerical titles, like Rev. Robert Skeris, KCHS.

Knights and Dames of papal orders are not allowed to use the prefix &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot; in the United Kingdom, although they may use post-nominal letters. Not allowing the prefix is because the use of foreign titles is not permitted by the British Crown without a Royal Licence, and as a matter of policy (currently based on a Royal Warrant of 27 April 1932), a Royal Licence to bear any foreign title is never granted. On the other hand, allowing the post-nominal letters would be explained by the highest and lowest dignities being universal, a king was recognized as king everywhere, and also a knight: &quot;though a Knight receive his Dignity of a Foreign Prince, he is so to be stiled in all Legal Proceedings within England .. and Knights in all Foreign Countries have ever place and precedency according to their Seniority of being Knighted&quot; 

===Ireland===
Established in 1783 and primarily awarded to men associated with the Kingdom of Ireland, Knights of the Order of St. Patrick were entitled to the style of &#x27;Sir&#x27;. Regular creation of new knights of the order ended in 1921 upon the formation of the Irish Free State. With the death of the last knight in 1974, the Order became dormant.
=== Philippines ===
Knights of Rizal (&quot;Orden de Caballeros de Rizál&quot;) is the sole order of knighthood of the Philippines currently constituted by legislative charter and recognized by the Orders, decorations, and medals of the Philippines. 

Knights are entitled to prefix &quot;Sir&quot; to their first names while their wives prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their first names. These apply to both spoken and written forms of address. Knights may also append the relevant post-nominal of their rank to the end of their names: Knight of Rizal (KR), Knight Officer of Rizal (KOR), Knight Commander of Rizal (KCR), Knight Grand Officer of Rizal (KGOR) and Knight Grand Cross of Rizal (KGCR). Knighthood may be conferred to both citizens and noncitizens of the Philippines. All knighthoods are substantive and the honorific may be used by all knights of the Order.

Notable members of the Order include King Juan Carlos I of Spain who was conferred a Knight Grand Cross of Rizal on 11 February 1998, Nobel Peace Prize winner and former US Secretary of State Sir Henry Kissinger, former Philippine President Sir Benigno Aquino III, and former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines and drafter of the 1987 Philippine constitution The Honorable Sir Hilario Davide, Jr. 

===Combinations with other titles and styles===
====Military====
In the case of a military officer who is also a knight, the appropriate form of address puts the professional military rank first, then the correct manner of address for the individual, then his name. Examples include:
* Admiral of the Fleet Sir Bruce Fraser, GCB, KBE (after 1941)
* Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey, GBE, KCB, CMG, DSO, ED (after 1941)

====Academic====
This is also the case with academic ranks and titles, such as &#x27;Professor&#x27;. For example, Patrick Bateson was both a professor and a knight bachelor; his correct title would be Professor Sir Patrick Bateson. However, the title of &#x27;Doctor&#x27; (Dr.) is not used in combination with &#x27;Sir&#x27;, with the knighthood taking precedence. Knighted doctors are addressed as knights, though they may still use any post-nominal letters associated with their degrees.

====Ecclesiastical====
Church of England clergy who receive knighthoods following their ordination do not receive an accolade and therefore do not use the title &#x27;Sir&#x27;, but instead refer to their knighthood using post-nominal letters. For example, the Reverend John Polkinghorne, KBE would never be referred to as &quot;Sir John Polkinghorne&quot;. If however an Anglican clergyman inherits a baronetcy or was knighted before his ordination, he will retain his style and title. For instance, Sir Nicholas Beatson-Bell KCSI, KCIE, who was a knighted Indian Civil Service officer and imperial administrator before entering the ministry, added the style of &quot;The Reverend&quot; to his secular honorific of &quot;Sir&quot;, thus becoming the Revd. Sir Nicholas Beatson-Bell KCSI, KCIE. Clergy of other denominations may use different conventions. 

====Peers and nobility====
Peers who have been knighted are neither styled as &#x27;Sir&#x27; nor addressed as such in the formal sense of the style, as their titles of nobility take precedence. The same principle applies for the male heir apparent to a dukedom, marquessate or earldom, his eldest legitimate son (if he is the heir to a dukedom or marquessate with additional subsidiary peerages), and for the legitimate male issue of a duke or a marquess, who are styled &#x27;Lord&#x27; followed by their first name. For instance, diplomat Lord Nicholas Gordon-Lennox, KCMG, KCVO, who was a younger son of the Duke of Richmond, continued to be styled as &#x27;Lord Nicholas&#x27; following his knighthood in 1986, not &#x27;Lord Sir Nicholas&#x27;. Other male heirs of an earl who lack courtesy titles, and the male heirs of a viscount or baron, do however use the style of &#x27;Sir&#x27; if knighted, the style following that of &#x27;The Hon&#x27;, for example The Honourable Sir Charles Algernon Parsons, OM, KCB, FRS.

==Educational, military and other usage==

===Education system===
&#x27;Sir&#x27;, along with &#x27;Miss&#x27; for women, is commonly used in the British school system to address teachers and other members of staff. Usage of these terms is considered a mark of respect, and can be dated back to the 16th century. The practice may have been an attempt to reinforce the authority of teachers from lower social classes among classes of largely upper class students. Jennifer Coates, emeritus professor of English language and linguistics at Roehampton University, has criticised the use of the title for male teachers, saying that Sir&#x27; is a knight. There weren&#x27;t women knights, but &#x27;Miss&#x27; is ridiculous: it doesn&#x27;t match &#x27;Sir&#x27; at all. It&#x27;s just one of the names you can call an unmarried woman&quot;, and that &quot;It&#x27;s a depressing example of how women are given low status and men, no matter how young or new in the job they are, are given high status&quot;. This view is not unchallenged, however. The chief executive of the Brook Learning Trust, Debbie Coslett, said &quot;... they call me &#x27;Miss&#x27;, I&#x27;m fine with that. They&#x27;re showing respect by giving me a title rather than &#x27;hey&#x27; or &#x27;oi, you&#x27; or whatever&quot;, and dismissed the male/female issue as &quot;just the way the English language works&quot;.

In the Southern United States, the term &#x27;sir&#x27; is often used to address someone in a position of authority or respect, and is commonly used in schools and universities by students to address their teachers and professors. Whereas the British and Commonwealth female equivalent is &quot;Miss&quot;, students will often refer to female teachers as &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;.

In the Northeast United States, particularly New England, there remains influence of both the British and French traditions as noted above; in general parlance, teachers, authority-figures, and so forth, are referred to by a title of respect such as &#x27;Sir&#x27; for males and &#x27;Miss&#x27;, &#x27;Ms&#x27;, or &#x27;Mrs&#x27; for females: &#x27;Miss&#x27; for unmarried, younger females; &#x27;Ms&#x27; for senior, elder, or ranking females that may or may not be married; and &#x27;Mrs&#x27; for married or widowed females.

===Military and police===
If not specifically using their rank or title, &#x27;sir&#x27; is used in the United States Armed Forces to address a male commissioned officer. Lower-ranking and non-commissioned officers, such as corporals or sergeants, are addressed using their ranks, though in some of the branches (to be precise, in the Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard), &quot;sir&quot; can also be used to address a drill instructor although he is an NCO.

In the British Armed Forces, male commissioned officers and warrant officers are addressed as &#x27;sir&#x27; by all ranks junior to them, male warrant officers are addressed as &quot;Mr&quot; by commissioned officers.

In the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), only commissioned officers are addressed as &#x27;sir&#x27;; NCOs and constables are addressed by their rank. Male British police officers of the rank of Inspector or above are addressed as &#x27;Sir&#x27; (women of inspecting rank are called Ma&#x27;am).

In the Hong Kong Police Force, male superiors are respectfully known by their surname followed by &#x27;sir&#x27;. For example, Inspector Wong would be addressed or referred to as &#x27;Wong-sir&#x27;. Male police officers are sometimes known colloquially as &quot;Ah-sir&quot; (阿Sir) to the wider public.

===Service industry===
The term &#x27;Sir&#x27; is also used frequently in the customer service industry, by employees to refer to customers, and sometimes vice versa. In the United States, it is much more common in certain areas (even when addressing male peers or men considerably younger). For example, a 1980 study showed that 80% of service interactions in the South were accompanied by &#x27;Sir&#x27; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;, in comparison to the Northern United States, where &#x27;Sir&#x27; was only used 25% of the time.

&#x27;Sir&#x27;, in conjunction with &#x27;Ma&#x27;am&#x27; or &#x27;Madam&#x27;, is also commonly used in the Philippines and South Asia, not only to address customers and vice versa, but also to address people of a higher social rank or age.

===Media===
&#x27;Sir&#x27; is used as gender-neutral term to address superior ranking officers in the series Star Trek and The Orville.

<doc id="226159" wikidata="Q6492123" url="?curid=226159" title="Las Cheris">
<text>Las Cheris was a Puerto Rican girl group of the early 1980s and 1990s composed of four girls aged 16 to 25. The band&#x27;s manager and owner of the group was Mr. Juan Rivera Muriente

After Menudo&#x27;s worldwide success, many other bands in Latin America, and particularly in Puerto Rico, tried to emulate Menudo&#x27;s success, including girl bands. Las Cheris was one of these bands and Fresitas and Monedas were other ones. Las Cheris and Monedas, for example, pointed out in such magazines as &quot;Vea&quot; and others, that they wanted to be the &quot;female version of Menudo&quot;.

Las Cheris enjoyed popularity on Puerto Rican radio and TV from 1983 to 1990. After that period, they faded away. However, one of them, Melina León, is now enjoying success as an international merengue singer. Mariadony Class, another member of the group, is the daughter of another Puerto Rican singer, José Miguel Class.

<text>A title is one or more words used before or after a person&#x27;s name, in certain contexts. It may signify either generation, an official position, or a professional or academic qualification. In some languages, titles may be inserted between the first and last name (for example, in German, Cardinal in Catholic usage – Richard Cardinal Cushing – or clerical titles such as Archbishop). Some titles are hereditary.

== Types ==

Titles include:
* Honorific titles or styles of address, a phrase used to convey respect to the recipient of a communication, or to recognize an attribute such as:
** Imperial, royal and noble ranks
** Academic degree
** Social titles, prevalent among certain sections of society due to historic or other reasons.
** Other accomplishment, as with a title of honor
* Title of authority, an identifier that specifies the office or position held by an official

== Titles in English-speaking areas ==
===Common titles===
* Mr. – All males
* Ms. – Adult women
* Mrs. – Married women (includes widows and divorcées)
* Miss – Unmarried women and girls (form of address)
* Madam (also Madame and Ma&#x27;am) – Formal form of address for an adult woman. Also used to denote a position of power or respect, similar to the usage of &quot;Mister&quot; for men, e.g. &quot;Mister/Madam Ambassador&quot;
* Mx. – Gender neutral or unspecified (may not be recognised in some places)

====Controversy around usage of common titles====
Some people object to the usage of titles to denote marital status, age or gender. In 2018, a campaign named GoTitleFree was launched to encourage businesses to stop requesting, storing and using marital status titles in their registration forms, and when speaking with customers, launched on the grounds that titles often lead to assumptions about a woman&#x27;s age or availability for marriage, and exclude non-binary people (though various titles, such as Mx., are increasingly used in some countries). This is in line with established practice advocated by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Government Digital Service which sets the standard for UK government online services. This in turn means that titles are optional on UK passports and driving licences.

====Familial====
Family titles in English-speaking countries include:

* Uncle – one&#x27;s parent&#x27;s brother (may also include great uncles)
* Aunt or Aunty – one&#x27;s parent&#x27;s sister (may also include great aunts)
* Granny, Gran, Grandma or Nana – one&#x27;s grandmother (may also include great-grandmothers)
* Pop, Grandpa, Gramps or Grandad – one&#x27;s grandfather (may also include great-grandfathers)

===Legislative and executive titles===
* Hon. (Honourable) (for younger sons and daughters of barons) and. Rt. Hon. (Right Honourable) (for Privy Councillors), used in the United Kingdom

Some job titles of members of the legislature and executive are used as titles.
*MP, for members of the Parliament (usually the lower house)
*MYP, for members of the UK Youth Parliament
*MSYP, for members of the Scottish Youth Parliament
* Representative
* Senator, for members of the American or Australian upper house
* Speaker, for speaker of Parliament 
* President (from which comes such titles as Deputy President, Executive Vice President, Lord President of the Council, and Vice President)
* Councillor, for member of a council 
* Youth Councillor (YC)
* Alderman/Selectman
* Delegate
* Mayor and related terms such as Lady Mayoress and Lord Mayor
* Governor and Lieutenant Governor
* Prefect
* Prelate
* Premier
* Burgess
* Ambassador
* Envoy
* Secretary, Cardinal Secretary of State, Foreign Secretary, General Secretary, Secretary of State, and other titles in the form &quot;Secretary of...&quot; in which Secretary means the same thing as Minister
* Attaché
* Chargé d&#x27;affaires
* Provost
* Minister (from which comes such titles as Prime Minister and Health Minister)

===Aristocratic titles===

* Prince/Princess – From the Latin , meaning &#x27;first person&#x27; or &#x27;first citizen&#x27;. The title was originally used by Augustus at the establishment of the Roman Empire to avoid the political risk of assuming the title (&#x27;King&#x27;) in what was technically still a republic. In modern times, the title is often given to the sons and daughters of ruling monarchs. Also a title of certain ruling monarchs under the Holy Roman Empire and its subsidiary territories until 1918 which is still used in Liechtenstein (Monaco still uses the title Prince to this day, even though it was not a part of the Holy Roman Empire), and in Imperial Russia before 1917. The German title is (&#x27;first&#x27;), a translation of the Latin term; the equivalent Russian term is (). 
* Archduke/Archduchess – A title derived from the Greek (&#x27;ruler; higher&#x27;) and the Latin (&#x27;leader&#x27;). It was used most notably by the Habsburg Dynasty, who ruled Austria and Hungary until 1918.
* Grand Duke/Grand Duchess – &#x27;Big; large&#x27; + Latin (&#x27;leader&#x27;). A variant of &quot;Archduke&quot;, used particularly in English translations Romanov Dynasty Russian titles. Also used in various Germanic territories until World War I. Still survives in Luxembourg.
* Duke/Duchess – From the Latin , a military title used in the Roman Empire, especially in its early Byzantine period when it designated the military commander for a specific zone.
* Marquis, Marquess/Marquise, or Marchioness – From the French , literally &#x27;ruler of a border area&#x27; (from the Old French meaning &#x27;border&#x27;; exact English translation is &#x27;March Lord&#x27;, or &#x27;Lord of the March&#x27;.
* Count/Countess - From the Latin meaning &#x27;companion&#x27;. The word was used by the Roman Empire in its Byzantine period as an honorific with a meaning roughly equivalent to modern English &quot;peer&quot;. It became the title of those who commanded field armies in the Empire, as opposed to , which commanded locally based forces.
* Earl (used in the United Kingdom instead of Count, but the feminine equivalent is Countess) – From the Germanic , meaning &#x27;chieftain&#x27;, the title was brought to the British Isles by the Anglo-Saxons and survives in use only there, having been superseded in Scandinavia and on the European continent.
* Viscount/Viscountess - From the Latin (&#x27;Deputy; substitute&#x27;. Hence &quot;vicar&quot; and prefix &quot;vice-&quot;) appended to Latin . Literally translates as &#x27;Deputy Count&#x27;.
* Baron/Baroness - From the Late Latin , meaning &#x27;man, servant, soldier&#x27;. The title originally designated the chief feudal tenant of a place, who was in vassalage to a greater lord.

In the United Kingdom, Lord and Lady are used as titles for members of the nobility. Unlike titles such as Mr and Mrs, they are not used before first names except in certain circumstances, for example as courtesy titles for younger sons, etc., of peers. In Scotland, Lord of Parliament and Lady of Parliament are the equivalents of Baron and Baroness in England.

* Lord – From the Old English , , meaning, literally, &#x27;bread-keeper&#x27;, from (&#x27;bread&#x27;) + (&#x27;guardian, keeper&#x27;) and by extension &#x27;husband, father, or chief&#x27;. (From which comes modified titles such as First Sea Lord and Lord of the Manor.) The feminine equivalent is Lady from the related Old English meaning, literally, &quot;bread-kneader&quot;, from (&quot;bread&quot;) + (&quot;maid&quot;), and by extension wife, daughter, or mistress of the house. (From which comes First Lady, the anachronistic Second Lady, etc.)
* Emperor/Empress – From the Latin , meaning &#x27;he/she who holds the authority to command ()&#x27;.
* King/Queen – Derived from Old Norse/Germanic words. The original meaning of the root of &quot;king&quot; apparently meant &#x27;leader of the family&#x27; or &#x27;descendant of the leader of the family&#x27;, and the original meaning of &quot;queen&quot; meant &#x27;wife&#x27;. By the time the words came into English they already meant &#x27;ruler&#x27;. 
* Tsar/Tsarina (Tsaritsa) – Slavonic loan-word from Latin.
* Caesar – The name of Julius Caesar taken by his heir Augustus and thereafter by Augustus&#x27; successors as Roman Emperor through the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Loaned into German as .
* Leader – From Old English , meaning &quot;to guide&quot;. The head of state of North Korea is titled Great Leader. The &quot;de facto&quot; head of state of Iran is titled Supreme Leader.
*Chief – A variation of the English &quot;Prince&quot;, used as the short form of the word &quot;Chieftain&quot; (except for in Scotland, where &quot;Chieftain&quot; is a title held by a titleholder subordinate to a chief). Generally used to refer to a recognised leader within a chieftaincy system. From this come the variations paramount chief, clan chief and village chief. The feminine equivalent is Chieftess.

===Titles used by knights, dames, baronets and baronetesses===
* Sir – Used by knights and baronets
* Dame – Used by dames and baronetesses

Both the titles &quot;Sir&quot; and &quot;Dame&quot; differ from titles such as &quot;Mr&quot; and &quot;Mrs&quot; in that they can only be used before a person&#x27;s first name, and not immediately before their surname. Neither &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot; confer nobility upon the titleholder.

<text>Lewis Paul Bremer III (born September 30, 1941) is a retired American diplomat. He was the second &quot;de facto&quot; head of state of Iraq as leader of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States, from May 2003 until June 2004.

==Early life and education==
Born on September 30, 1941, in Hartford, Connecticut, Bremer was educated at New Canaan Country School, Kent School, and Phillips Academy Andover. Bremer&#x27;s father was president of the Christian Dior Perfumes Corporation in New York and his mother was a lecturer in art history at the University of Bridgeport.

Bremer graduated from Yale University in 1963 and went on to earn an MBA from Harvard University in 1966. He later continued his education at the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris, where he earned a Certificate of Political Studies (CEP).

== Career ==

=== Foreign Service ===

That same year he joined the Foreign Service, which sent him first to Kabul, Afghanistan, as a general services officer. He was assigned to Blantyre, Malawi, as economic and commercial officer from 1968 to 1971.

During the 1970s, Bremer held various domestic posts with the U.S. State Department, including posts as an assistant to Henry Kissinger from 1972 to 1976. He accompanied Kissinger on shuttle diplomacy missions to Israel, Syria, and Egypt to resolve the Yom Kippur War in 1973. He was Deputy Chief of Mission in Oslo, Norway, from 1976 to 1979, returning to the United States to take a post of deputy executive secretary of the Department of State, where he remained from 1979 until 1981. In 1981, he was promoted to executive secretary and special assistant to Alexander Haig.

Ronald Reagan appointed Bremer as ambassador to the Netherlands in 1983 and ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism and coordinator for counterterrorism in 1986.
=== Private sector ===
Bremer retired from the Foreign Service in 1989 and became managing director at Kissinger and Associates, a worldwide consulting firm founded by Henry Kissinger. A career member of the Senior Foreign Service, class of career minister, Bremer received the State Department Superior Honor Award, two Presidential Meritorious Service Awards, and the Distinguished Honor Award from the Secretary of State. Before rejoining government in 2003, he was chairman and CEO of Marsh Crisis Consulting, a risk and insurance services firm which is a subsidiary of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies.

He also served as a trustee on the Economic Club of New York, and a board member of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Akzo Nobel NV, the Harvard Business School Club of New York and the Netherland-America Foundation. He served on the International Advisory Boards of Komatsu Corporation and Chugai Pharmaceuticals.

Bremer and 1,700 of the employees of Marsh &amp; McLennan had offices in the World Trade Center. Bremer&#x27;s office was in the North Tower. In an interview with CNN after the September 11 attacks, he stated that their office was located &quot;above where the second aircraft hit.&quot; On September 11, he was interviewed in Washington on WRC-TV at 12:30 pm in-studio.

Bremer and his wife were the founders of the Lincoln/Douglass Scholarship Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit that provides high school scholarships to inner-city youths.

===National Commission on Terrorism===
Bremer was appointed chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism by House Speaker Dennis Hastert in 1999. The report, &quot;Countering The Changing Threat of International Terrorism&quot;, was published in June 2000. He also served on the National Academy of Sciences&#x27; Committee on Science and Technology for Countering Terrorism, which authored a 2002 report called &quot;Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism.&quot;

===Provisional coalition administrator of Iraq===

Bremer was appointed by President George W. Bush as presidential envoy to Iraq on May 9, 2003. His appointment declared him subject to the &quot;authority, direction and control&quot; of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

Bremer arrived in Iraq in May 2003. On May 11 he replaced Lt. General Jay Garner as Director of the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance. In June, the Office was transformed into the Coalition Provisional Authority, and Bremer became the country&#x27;s chief executive authority. As the holder of the &quot;most powerful foreign post held by any American since Gen. Douglas MacArthur in Japan,&quot; he compared himself to MacArthur as well as General Lucius Clay, who was in charge of the American zone in Germany following its defeat in World War II.

As the top civilian administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority, Bremer was permitted to rule by decree. Among his first and most notable decrees were Coalition Provisional Authority Order 1, which banned the Ba&#x27;ath party in all forms and Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2, which dismantled the Iraqi Army.

On July 13, 2003, Bremer approved the creation of an Iraqi Interim Governing Council with the stated mission of &quot;ensuring that the Iraqi people&#x27;s interests are represented.&quot; The council members were chosen by Bremer from among groups and individuals which had supported the American invasion of Iraq. Bremer retained veto power over the council&#x27;s proposals. The council was authorized to select a limited number of delegates to key Coalition Provisional Authority committees, like the Program Review Board.

Bremer also empowered the CPA to develop and implement the Iraqi constitution. The constitution became controversial when the first draft submitted by the CPA suggested banning political parties opposed to the U.S. occupation from participating in elections; privatizing much of Iraq&#x27;s industries and natural resources; and allowing the unelected Iraqi Interim Governing Council to sign a binding Status of Forces Agreement between Iraq and the United States. On March 1, 2004, after several hours of negotiations, the Iraqi Interim Governing Council resolved the council members&#x27; disagreements with clauses in the constitution. A formal signing ceremony was scheduled for March 5, 2004. As the guests waited and the orchestra played, the signing was canceled due to mass demonstrations. Finally, on March 8, 2004, an interim constitution was signed. It was to be revised or replaced by a second constitution after Iraqi elections.

On June 28, 2004, at 10:26 am local time, the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority formally transferred limited sovereignty of Iraqi territory to the Iraqi Interim Government, two days ahead of schedule. Bremer departed from the country on the same day. In his farewell speech, broadcast on Iraqi television, he said, &quot;I leave Iraq gladdened by what has been accomplished and confident that your future is full of hope. A piece of my heart will always remain here in the beautiful land between the two rivers, with its fertile valleys, its majestic mountains and its wonderful people&quot;.

Bremer&#x27;s office was a division of the U.S. Department of Defense, and as administrator he reported directly to the United States Secretary of Defense and the President of the United States. His senior adviser Dan Senor served as coalition spokesman, working with military spokesman Mark Kimmitt.

Bremer&#x27;s role as the head of the CPA is notable for being the subject of much criticism. Large sums of money were reported to have gone missing under Bremer&#x27;s leadership. Bremer&#x27;s attempts at privatizing much of Iraq&#x27;s infrastructure and mineral wealth were also highly criticized and the decision, apparently formulated in the office of the Secretary of Defense, to disband the Iraqi Army is widely blamed for fueling the Iraqi insurgency against the American occupation.

John Negroponte replaced Bremer as the highest-ranking American civilian in Iraq.

===Post-Iraq career===
After his return from Iraq, Bremer engaged in a few speaking tours. On December 14, 2004, Bremer was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bush, America&#x27;s highest civil award for &quot;especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.&quot; &quot;He was also presented with the Department of Defense award for Distinguished Public Service and the Nixon Library honored him with the &quot;Victory of Freedom Award&quot; for &quot;demonstrating leadership and working towards peace and freedom&quot;.

Bremer&#x27;s April 18, 2005, visit to Clark University as a guest speaker led to protests against his role in the Iraq War. Dissatisfied with Bremer&#x27;s speech and answers, several students also voiced disappointment at the university for having paid him $40,000. Another appearance, scheduled for the public library of his hometown, New Canaan, Connecticut, on January 18, 2006, was moved to the private St. Luke&#x27;s School in the same town for fear for protests. During a February 27, 2006 public appearance at Lynchburg College, where his sister-in-law is an assistant dean, Bremer insisted that his decision to disband the Iraqi Armed Forces was the correct one.

Among other things, Bremer repeatedly asserted that when he came to Iraq, the Iraqi army had abandoned its barracks, and therefore &quot;there was no army to disband&quot;. He also repeatedly defended his decision to expel Ba&#x27;ath Party members from government posts by comparing Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler.

On February 6, 2007, Bremer appeared before a congressional committee investigating fraud and abuse and was questioned about missing funds during his tenure as head of the CPA and a January 2005 audit that found $8.8 billion in unaccounted for funds.

====Memoir====
In 2006, Bremer published a memoir called &quot;My Year in Iraq: The Struggle to Build a Future of Hope&quot;, which was described as &quot;an almost day-by-day narrative that sticks to what Bremer was doing and with whom he was interacting, without providing much analysis or introspection.&quot; Michiko Kakutani of &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized it as &quot;an amalgam of spin and sincerity, is partly an explanation (or rationalization) of actions Mr. Bremer took as America&#x27;s man in Baghdad, partly an effort to issue some &#x27;I told you so&#x27;s&#x27; to administration colleagues, and partly an attempt to spread (or reassign) responsibility (or blame) by tracing just who in the White House, Pentagon and State Department signed off on or ordered critical decisions made during his tenure&quot;.

His media commentary is generally critical of the Obama administration for not devoting more effort to promoting democracy overseas. He is also a consistent advocate for continued U.S. presence in Iraq. On the other hand, while many other conservatives began advocating for a withdrawal from Afghanistan, Bremer endorsed the administration&#x27;s new strategy in 2010, describing it as &quot;reasonable&quot; and giving Obama &quot;credit for deciding to replicate President Bush&#x27;s Iraq strategy by sending more troops to the fight in Afghanistan&quot;. He has also endorsed Samuel P. Huntington&#x27;s &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; thesis, stating: &quot;It is a fact of history that Europe is based on Judeo-Christian values. But Europe seems unwilling, or perhaps afraid, to acknowledge this reality.&quot;

====Painting and writing====
After taking art lessons at a school in Glen Echo, Maryland, in 2007, Bremer began doing oil paintings of New England country landscapes, which he sells through his company Bremer Enterprises. What he sells proceeds to the historical societies of Chester and Grafton in Vermont, where he moved after his public retirement. He has self-mockingly described his style of painting as &quot;evolving American primitive&quot;.

The Bremer Enterprises website also provides links to books by Bremer and his wife Frances Winfield Bremer. In addition to his 2006 memoir, in September 2011 Bremer published &quot;From Sea to Shining Sea: Biking Across America with Wounded Warriors&quot;, on Amazon.com&#x27;s Kindle platform via Bremer Enterprises.

====Ski instructor====
During his time in Afghanistan, he set up the country&#x27;s first ski run in the mountains outside Kabul. Bremer has worked for several seasons as a ski instructor at Okemo Mountain Resort in Vermont.

====Board activities====
He also engages in consulting work and serves on a number of boards. Bremer currently serves on the board of directors of BlastGard International, a Florida-based company that manufactures materials to mitigate the impact of explosions.

In November 2010, Bremer joined World T.E.A.M. Sports, a Holbrook, New York-based nonprofit, as CEO and President. Bremer also served as a member of the organization&#x27;s board of directors. He retired from the organization in March 2012 and as of 2015 was listed as a &#x27;Special Advisor&#x27;.

Bremer formerly served as a member of the board of directors of the International Republican Institute. 

He received the America Award of the Italy-USA Foundation in 2013.

===Internet meme===
Bremer appears in a viral internet meme, where his phrase &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we got him&quot; following the capture of Saddam Hussein is used to accompany someone getting &#x27;busted&#x27; or exposed, often with Breakbot&#x27;s &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Yours&quot; playing in the background. After his granddaughter informed him of the trend, he was fascinated by it and hoped it would increase people&#x27;s interest in Iraq&#x27;s recent events.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Disbanding the Iraqi Army===
On May 23, 2003, Bremer issued Order Number 2, in effect dissolving the entire former Iraqi army and putting 400,000 former Iraqi soldiers out of work. The move was widely criticized for creating a large pool of armed and disgruntled youths for the insurgency. Former soldiers took to the streets in mass protests to demand back pay. Many of them threatened violence if their demands were not met. Bremer was later heavily criticized for officially disbanding the former Iraqi Army. During Bremer&#x27;s stay in Iraq, Osama bin Laden allegedly placed a bounty of 10,000 grams of gold on Bremer, the equivalent of US$125,000 at the time.

Despite the messages the CIA reportedly communicated to the Iraqi army, the argument was still ventured that by the time Baghdad fell on April 9, 2003, the previous Army had demobilized, or as Bremer puts it, &quot;had simply dissolved&quot;. However, as Mark Danner reports in an essay in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; entitled &quot;Iraq: The War of Imagination&quot; from September 2006, American agents—including one colonel and a number of CIA operatives—had already begun meeting regularly with Iraqi officers in order to reconstitute the army as a working force. Implied in this is the notion that the army, temporarily &quot;demobilized&quot; or not, did in fact continue to exist as a coherent entity, indeed coherent enough that it could be consulted and negotiated with. This seems to concur with the position of the first Director of the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Jay Garner, who Bremer had replaced. As Bob Woodward reports in &quot;State of Denial&quot;, Garner, upon hearing of the order to disband the army, attempted to convince Bremer to rethink the dissolution. Bremer was reported as saying: &quot;The plans have changed. The thought is we don&#x27;t want the residuals of the old army. We want a new and fresh army.&quot; To this, Garner replied: &quot;Jerry, you can get rid of an army in a day, but it takes years to build one.&quot;

The issue of disbanding the old Iraqi Army found itself, once again, the center of media attention with two articles explaining why Bremer ostensibly did not make the decision on his own. The first press release by &quot;The New York Times&quot; included a letter written by Bremer to President Bush dated May 20, 2003, describing the progress made so far since Bremer&#x27;s arrival in Baghdad, including one sentence that reads &quot;I will parallel this step with an even more robust measure dissolving Saddam&#x27;s military and intelligence structures to emphasize that we mean business.&quot;

The second press release dated September 6, 2007, was submitted by Bremer as a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed. Titled &quot;How I Didn&#x27;t Dismantle Iraq&#x27;s Army&quot;, Bremer says he did not make the decision on his own, and that the decision was reviewed by &quot;top civilian and military members of the American government&quot; including the then-USCENTCOM Commander, General John Abizaid, who briefed officials in Washington that there were no more &quot;organized Iraqi military units&quot;.

Bremer&#x27;s article goes into further detail about how the Coalition Provisional Authority considered two alternatives: To recall the old army or to rebuild a new army with &quot;both vetted members of the old army and new recruits&quot;. According to Bremer, Abizaid preferred the second.

Bremer also details the situation he and the major decision makers faced; especially when the large Shiite majority in the new army could have had problems with the thought of having a former Sunni officer issuing orders.

Furthermore, a memo from U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on May 8, 2003, that said &quot;the coalition &#x27;will actively oppose Saddam Hussein&#x27;s old enforcers—the Baath Party, Fedayeen Saddam, etc ... &#x27;we will make clear that the coalition will eliminate the remnants of Saddam&#x27;s regime&#x27;&quot; was sent to both National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of State Colin Powell.

After two protesters were killed by U.S. troops, the CPA agreed to pay up to 250,000 former soldiers a stipend of $50 to $150 a month. Conscripts were given a single severance payment. Many of the former soldiers found this to be grossly inadequate.

Charles H. Ferguson, director of critically acclaimed &quot;No End in Sight&quot;, created a video response to Bremer&#x27;s op-ed on September 6, 2007. (This was the very first &quot;New York Times&quot; video op-ed in history.)

===&quot;De-Ba&#x27;athification&quot; of the Iraqi civil service===
Saddam Hussein&#x27;s ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party counted among its members a majority of Iraq&#x27;s governmental employees, including educational officials and some teachers, though as of 2003 members of the Ba&#x27;ath Party had constituted only around 10% of the Iraqi population. By order of the CPA, the top 1% of Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party members were forbidden from holding government positions, but were still permitted to open businesses and work at newspapers, and all public sector employees affiliated with the Ba&#x27;ath Party were to be removed from their positions and be banned from any future employment in the public sector. When the CPA turned over enforcement of de-Ba&#x27;athification to Iraqi politicians, however, these rules were broadly expanded and used to punish political opponents, including nearly 11,000 teachers who were dismissed from the party and removed from government—a phenomenon which Bremer worked with the then-Education Minister to fix. Critics claim these measures helped to create and worsen an atmosphere of discontent among Iraqis and that de-Ba&#x27;athification, coupled with the disbandment of the Iraqi military, if not created then at least fueled the insurgency against Coalition Forces. This policy of &quot;de-Ba&#x27;athification&quot; was reversed in January 2008.

Bremer was once again warned of the harm his actions would have. According to Woodward, when Garner asserted that none of the ministries would be able to function after this order, Bremer asked the Baghdad station chief for his thoughts. &quot;If you put this out ... you will put 50,000 people on the street, underground, and mad at Americans&quot;, he replied. Woodward: &quot;And these 50,000 were the most powerful, well-connected elites from all walks of life&quot;.

===Iraq&#x27;s oil revenue===
Bremer was accountable to the Secretary of Defense for the actions he took. But, since his authority to spend Iraq&#x27;s oil revenue derived from United Nations Resolution 1483, he was also accountable to the United Nations. The authority he derived from the UN to spend Iraq&#x27;s oil revenue bound him to show that:
* Expenditures were intended to benefit the Iraqi people.
* The programs that were funded were decided upon, and supervised in an open, transparent manner.
* Iraqis were invited to give meaningful input into how funds were spent.
* The administrator of Iraq was cooperating with the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB)
* That proper fiscal controls were in place, so that it could be demonstrated that none of the funds were diverted, or misspent.
One of the concerns the IAMB raised repeatedly was that the CPA had repaired the well-heads and pipelines for transporting Iraq&#x27;s oil, but they had stalled on repairing the meters that were necessary to document the shipment of Iraqi oil, so it could be demonstrated that none of it was being smuggled.

On June 22, 2004, in a final press release before the CPA&#x27;s authority expired, the IAMB stated:

The CPA has acknowledged that the failure to meter the oil shipments resulted in some oil smuggling—an avoidable loss of Iraq&#x27;s oil that was Bremer&#x27;s responsibility. Neither Bremer nor any of his staff has offered an explanation for their failure to repair the meters.

===Financial===

====Failure to perform month-end cash reconciliations====
Under Bremer&#x27;s stewardship the CPA requested $12 billion in cash from the U.S. Treasury. Under Bremer&#x27;s stewardship the CPA paid out $12 billion in cash. The external auditors management notes point out that the CPA didn&#x27;t perform a cash reconciliation until April 2004, eleven months into Bremer&#x27;s mandate, when they started their work. See Congressional hearing when Ambassador Paul Bremer and Stuart Bowen, the special inspector general for Iraq Reconstruction, testified on management of U.S. funds in Iraq.

====Failure to employ qualified internal auditors====
In his second regulation, Bremer committed the Coalition Provisional Authority to hire a reputable firm of certified chartered accountants, to serve as internal auditors, to help make sure the Coalition&#x27;s finances were administered according to modern accounting principles. These internal auditors would be separate and distinct from the external auditors who would report to the International Advisory and Monitoring Board. Bremer did not make sure the CPA hired internal auditors, however.

When the external auditors arrived, they learned that Bremer had not made sure the CPA lived up to the commitment to hire internal auditors to help set up a reliable accounting system. On the contrary they learned that a single contracted consultant kept track of the CPA&#x27;s expenditures in a series of spreadsheets.

The external auditors reported that rather than use a modern double entry accounting system the CPA used what they described as &quot;a single-entry, cash-based transaction list&quot;.

====Unaccounted-for funds====
On January 30, 2005, an official report by Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen cited by &quot;Time&quot; stated that $9 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq might have disappeared in fraud, corruption, and other misbehavior. On one particular salary register, only 602 names among 8,206 could be verified. As another cited example, the Coalition Authority authorized Iraqi officials to postpone declaring the reception of $2.5 billion, which the provisional government had received in spring through the Oil for Food program.

Bremer wrote an eight-page reply to deny the accusations and stated that, during the IG&#x27;s inquiry, Bowen&#x27;s people refused to interview Bremer&#x27;s deputies, and the IG&#x27;s report failed to mention that Bremer and his people worked under extraordinary conditions, faced a high turnover rate, and had insufficient number of personnel to carry out their rebuilding and humanitarian relief efforts.

Bremer&#x27;s claim that Bowen&#x27;s staff made no attempt to interview his staff is at odds with the detailed account of the external auditors, of their attempts to meet with Bremer and his staff. In their management notes they describe how some of the CPA&#x27;s senior staff, including Bremer himself, just would not make themselves available to meet with the auditors. Others, like George Wolfe, the CPA&#x27;s de facto treasurer, showed a total lack of cooperation.

This issue also became a topic of discussion during some of Bremer&#x27;s Q&amp;A sessions with students who attended Bremer&#x27;s presentations during Bremer&#x27;s campus speaking tours. Some questioned Bremer if he could have done things differently in Iraq, but were notably disappointed when he avoided the question. Bremer allegedly responded to one such question with, &quot;I will tell you what I told them, I&#x27;m saving that for my book ... I need more time to reflect&quot;.

===Shutting down the newspaper &quot;Al-Hawza&quot;===
On March 28, 2004, Bremer ordered the 759th Military Police Battalion to shut down Iraqi newspaper &quot;al-Hawza&quot; for two months. This move was widely criticized as running directly counter to the Bush administration&#x27;s announced goal of helping transform Iraq into a modern, democratic state. This move was even criticized by members of Bremer&#x27;s own appointees on the Iraqi Governing Council.

&quot;Al-Hawza&quot; started after the removal of Saddam Hussein and was considered a mouthpiece for Shi&#x27;ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. It was shut down by the United States-led administration headed by Bremer on March 28, 2004, after being accused of encouraging violence against Coalition troops. There was discussion with Sir Jeremy Greenstock (UK&#x27;s Special Representative for Iraq), about preparations to arrest al-Sadr, who by early March 2004 had increased his militia following, the Mahdi army, from about 200 followers to some 6,000, in seven months. Bremer wrote in his book that &quot;Greenstock said that this would be a difficult time to go after him ... I first urged [his] arrest last August&quot;.

Iyad Allawi, leader of the interim government, explicitly gave &quot;al-Hawza&quot; permission to re-open on July 18, 2004.

===Granting foreign contractors immunity from Iraqi law===
Two days before he left Iraq, Bremer signed Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17, which gave everyone associated with the CPA and the American government immunity from Iraqi law. One of his former top aides is quoted as saying that Bremer &quot;wanted to make sure our military, civilians and contractors were protected from Iraqi law.&quot; This stipulation was later incorporated into Iraqi law.

Since then, violent events in Iraq involving American security companies such as Blackwater have triggered great resentment among Iraqi citizens, who view them as private armies acting with impunity.

===Early departure===
Bremer&#x27;s early departure was a complete surprise. But the turnover of political power a couple of days earlier was suggested by members of the Bush administration to thwart any plans the insurgency may have had for June 30.

U.S. intelligence sources had monitored chatter that suggested resistance elements were planning demonstrations, or outright attacks, to coincide with the time of the official handover. An early handover would preempt the plans of resistance elements.

His early departure was disruptive to the smooth transition of authority, as the KPMG audit of the Development Fund for Iraq made clear. In their management notes the external auditors describe trying to meet with Bremer, and being very surprised by his early departure.

Many of Bremer&#x27;s senior staff left when he did, meaning that important documents required for the completion of the audit could not be signed by the appropriate staff members.

Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called Bremer &quot;the largest single disaster in American foreign policy in modern times,&quot; stating that he should have been relieved of his duties &quot;no later than&quot; September 2003.

<text>Apidae is the largest family within the superfamily Apoidea, containing at least 5700 species of bees. The family includes some of the most commonly seen bees, including bumblebees and honey bees, but also includes stingless bees (also used for honey production), carpenter bees, orchid bees, cuckoo bees, and a number of other less widely known groups. Many are valuable pollinators in natural habitats and for agricultural crops.

==Taxonomy==
In addition to its historical classification (honey bees, bumble bees, stingless bees and orchid bees), the family Apidae presently includes all the genera formerly placed in the families Anthophoridae and Ctenoplectridae. Although the most visible members of Apidae are social, the vast majority of apid bees are solitary, including a number of kleptoparasitic species.

The old family Apidae contained four tribes (Apinae: Apini, Euglossini and Bombinae: Bombini, Meliponini) which have been reclassified as tribes of the subfamily Apinae, along with all of the former tribes and subfamilies of Anthophoridae and the former family Ctenoplectridae, which was demoted to tribe status. The trend to move groups down in taxonomic rank has been taken further by a 2005 Brazilian classification that places all existing bee families together under the name &quot;Apidae&quot;, but it has not been widely accepted in the literature since that time.

===Subfamilies===
====Apinae====
The subfamily Apinae contains honey bees, bumblebees, stingless bees, orchid bees, and digger bees, among others. The bees of most tribes placed in Apinae are solitary with nests that are simple burrows in the soil. However, honey bees, stingless bees, and bumblebees are eusocial or colonial. These are sometimes believed to have each developed this trait independently, and show notable differences in such characteristics as communication between workers and methods of nest construction.

Tribes include:
*Ancylaini
*Anthophorini
*Apini
*Bombini
*Centridini
*Ctenoplectrini
*Emphorini—(Subtribe Ancyloscelidina; Subtribe Emphorina)
*Ericrocidini
*Eucerini
*Euglossini
*Exomalopsini
*Isepeolini
*Melectini
*Meliponini
*Osirini
*Protepeolini
*Rhathymini
*Tapinotaspidini
*Tarsaliini
*Tetrapediini
*Teratognathini

====Nomadinae====

The subfamily Nomadinae, or cuckoo bees, has 31 genera in 10 tribes which are all cleptoparasites in the nests of other bees.

Tribes include:
*Ammobatini
*Ammobatoidini
*Biastini
*Brachynomadini
*Caenoprosopidini
*Epeolini—(Subtribe Epeolina; Subtribe Odyneropsina; Subtribe Thalestriina)
*Hexepeolini
*Neolarrini
*Nomadini
*Townsendiellini

====Xylocopinae====
The subfamily Xylocopinae, which includes carpenter bees, are mostly solitary, though they tend to be gregarious. Some tribe lineages, such as the Allodapini, contain eusocial species.

Most members of this subfamily make nests in plant stems or wood.

Tribes include:
*Allodapini 
*Ceratinini 
*Manueliini
*Xylocopini

<text>The superfamily Apoidea is a major group (of over 30 000 species) within the Hymenoptera, which includes two traditionally recognized lineages, the &quot;sphecoid&quot; wasps, and the bees. Molecular phylogeny demonstrates that the bees arose from within the traditional &quot;Crabronidae&quot;, so that grouping is paraphyletic, and this has led to a reclassification to produce monophyletic families.

== Nomenclature ==
Bees appear in recent classifications to be a specialized lineage of &quot;crabronid&quot; wasps that switched to the use of pollen and nectar as larval food, rather than insect prey; this makes the traditional &quot;Crabronidae&quot; a paraphyletic group. Accordingly, bees and sphecoids are now all grouped together in a single superfamily, and the older available name is &quot;Apoidea&quot; rather than &quot;Sphecoidea&quot; (which, like Spheciformes, has been used in the past, but also defined a paraphyletic group and has been abandoned).

As bees (not including their wasp ancestors) are still considered a monophyletic group, they are given a grouping between superfamily and family to unify all bees, Anthophila.

==Phylogeny==

This phylogenetic tree is based on Sann &quot;et al.&quot;, 2018, which used phylogenomics to demonstrate that both the bees (Anthophila) and the Sphecidae arose from within the former &quot;Crabronidae,&quot; which is therefore paraphyletic, and which they suggested should be split into several families; the former family Heterogynaidae nests in Nyssonini within the Bembicidae, as defined by these authors. These findings differ in several details from studies published by two other sets of authors in 2017, though all three studies demonstrate a paraphyletic &quot;Crabronidae.&quot;

<text>Commander (commonly abbreviated as Cmdr.) is a common naval officer rank as well as a job title in many armies. Commander is also used as a rank or title in other formal organizations, including several police forces. In several countries, this naval rank is termed as a frigate captain.

Commander is also a generic term for an officer commanding any armed forces unit, such as &quot;platoon commander&quot;, &quot;brigade commander&quot; and &quot;squadron commander&quot;. In the police, terms such as &quot;borough commander&quot; and &quot;incident commander&quot; are used.

==Commander as a naval and air force rank==

Commander is a rank used primarily in navies, and is very rarely used as a rank in armies. In most armies, the term &quot;commander&quot; is used as a job title. For example, in the US Army, an officer with the rank of captain (NATO rank code OF-2) may hold the title of &quot;company commander&quot;, whereas an officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel (NATO rank code OF-4) typically holds the title of &quot;battalion commander&quot;. 

The title, originally &quot;master and commander&quot;, originated in the 18th century to describe naval officers who commanded ships of war too large to be commanded by a lieutenant but too small to warrant the assignment of a post-captain and (before about 1770) a sailing master; the commanding officer served as his own master. In practice, these were usually unrated sloops-of-war of no more than 20 guns. The Royal Navy shortened &quot;master and commander&quot; to &quot;commander&quot; in 1794; however, the term &quot;master and commander&quot; remained (unofficially) in common parlance for several years. The equivalent American rank master commandant remained in use until changed to commander in 1838.

A corresponding rank in some navies is frigate captain. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the rank has been assigned the NATO rank code of OF-4.

Various functions of commanding officers were also styled &quot;commander&quot;. In the navy of the Dutch Republic, anyone who commanded a ship or a fleet without having an appropriate rank to do so could be called a . This included &quot;ad hoc&quot; fleet commanders and acting captains (). In the fleet of the Admiralty of Zeeland however, was a formal rank, the equivalent of (rear-admiral) in the other Dutch admiralties. The Dutch use of the title as a rank lives on in the Royal Netherlands Navy, as the equivalent of commodore. In the Royal Netherlands Air Force, however, this rank is known by the English spelling of which is the Dutch equivalent of the British air commodore.

=== Australia ===
The rank of commander in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is identical in description to that of a commander in the British Royal Navy. RAN chaplains who are in divisions 1, 2 or 3 (of five divisions) have the equivalent rank standing of commanders. This means that to officers and NCOs below the rank of commander, lieutenant colonel, or wing commander, the chaplain is a superior.

To those officers ranked higher than commander, the chaplain is subordinate. Although this equivalency exists, RAN chaplains who are in divisions 1, 2 or 3 do not actually wear the rank of commander, and they hold no command privilege.

=== Canada ===
=== Romania ===
The rank of commander ( in Romanian) is used by both the Romanian Air Force and Romanian Naval Forces. It is equivalent to the army rank of Colonel (OF-5). In both cases, the rank is above (, OF-4). In the air force, is below the rank of (), while in the navy it is below (). The rank was also used in the Royal Romanian Air Force and Navy until the proclamation of the Republic.

===Scandinavia===
Commander is a naval rank in Scandinavia ( in Danish and Norwegian, in Swedish) equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of captain. The Scandinavian rank of commander is immediately above &quot;commander-captain&quot; (, , ), which is equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of commander.

==== Denmark ====

In Denmark, the rank of commander exists as (commander captain or commanding captain), which is senior to (captain) and (commander), which is senior to . &quot;Kommandørkaptajn&quot; is officially translated into English as &quot;Commander, Senior Grade&quot;, while &quot;orlogskaptajn&quot; is officially translated as &#x27;&quot;Commander.&quot;

=== United Kingdom ===

====Royal Navy====

A commander in the Royal Navy is above the rank of lieutenant commander, below the rank of captain, and is equivalent in rank to a lieutenant colonel in the army. A commander may command a frigate, destroyer, submarine, aviation squadron or shore installation, or may serve on a staff.

====Royal Air Force====
Since the British Royal Air Force&#x27;s mid-rank officers&#x27; ranks are modeled on those of the Royal Navy, the term wing commander is used as a rank, and this is the equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in the army or a commander in the navy. The rank of wing commander is above that of squadron leader and below that of group captain.
In the former Royal Naval Air Service, which was merged with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force in 1918, the pilots held appointments as well as their normal ranks in the Royal Navy, and they wore insignia appropriate to the appointment instead of the rank. A flight commander wore a star above a lieutenant&#x27;s two rank stripes, squadron commander wore two stars above two rank stripes (less than eight years&#x27; seniority) or two-and-a-half rank stripes (over eight years seniority), and wing commander wore three rank stripes. The rank stripes had the usual Royal Navy curl, and they were surmounted by an eagle.

===United States===

In the United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps, commander (abbreviated &quot;CDR&quot;) is a senior-grade officer rank, with the pay grade of O-5. Commander ranks above lieutenant commander (O-4) and below captain. (O-6). Commander is equivalent to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, United States Air Force, United States Marine Corps, and United States Space Force. Notably, commander is the first rank at which the holder wears an embellished cap, whereas officers of the other military services are entitled to embellishment of similar headgear at O-4 rank.

Promotion to commander in the U.S. Navy is governed by United States Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1980 or its companion Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA). DOPMA/ROPMA guidelines suggest that 70% of lieutenant commanders should be promoted to commander after serving a minimum of three years at their present rank and after attaining 15 to 17 years of cumulative commissioned service, although this percentage may vary and be appreciably less for certain officer designators (i.e., primary &quot;specialties&quot;) depending on defense budgets, force structure, and the needs of the service.

==Commander as a military appointment==

For instance, as in various small colonial settlements (such as various Caribbean islands) commanding the garrison was the crux of the top job, the military title &quot;Commandeur&quot; could be used instead of a civilian gubernatorial style, not unlike the Portuguese captain-major.

===British Army===
In the British Army, the term &quot;commander&quot; is officially applied to the non-commissioned officer in charge of a section (section commander), vehicle (vehicle commander) or gun (gun commander), to the subaltern or captain commanding a platoon (platoon commander), or to the brigadier commanding a brigade (brigade commander). Other officers commanding units are usually referred to as the officer commanding (OC), commanding officer (CO), general officer commanding (GOC), or general officer commanding-in-chief (GOC-C), depending on rank and position, although the term &quot;commander&quot; may be applied to them informally.

In the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry commander is a rank equivalent to major.

=== Netherlands ===
&quot;Commandeur&quot; as a title of colonial office was the case on the island of Tobago in the Dutch colony of Nieuw Walcheren.

===New Zealand Army===
The usage is similar/identical to the British Army, with the term &quot;commander&quot; having been applied to the colonel who was Commander, 2 Land Force Group, Linton Camp, and now to Commander, 1 Brigade.

===Spanish Armed Forces and &quot;Guardia Civil&quot;===
In the Spanish Army, the Spanish Air Force and the marine infantry, the term commander is the literal translation of &quot;comandante&quot;, the Spanish equivalent of a Commonwealth major. The &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; shares the army ranks, and the officer commanding a house-garrison (usually an NCO or a lieutenant, depending on the size) is addressed as the &quot;comandante de puesto&quot; (post commander).

===United States Army===
In the United States Army, the term &quot;commander&quot; is officially applied to the commanding officer of army units; hence, there are company commanders, battalion commanders, brigade commanders, and so forth. At the highest levels of U.S. military command structure, &quot;commander&quot; also refers to what used to be called commander-in-chief, or CINC, until October 24, 2002, although the term CINC is still used in casual speech.

===United States Air Force===
In the United States Air Force, the term &quot;commander&quot; (abbreviated &quot;CC&quot; in office symbols, i.e. &quot;OG/CC&quot; for &quot;operations group commander&quot;) is applied officially to the commanding officer of an Air Force unit; hence, there are flight commanders, squadron commanders, group commanders, wing commanders, numbered air force commanders, and commanders of major commands. In rank, a flight commander is typically a lieutenant or captain, a squadron commander is typically a major or lieutenant colonel, a group commander is typically a colonel, a wing commander is typically a senior colonel or a brigadier general, a numbered air force commander is a major general or lieutenant general, and the commander of a major command is a general.

===United States Space Force===
In the United States Space Force, the term &quot;commander&quot; is applied officially to the commanding officer of a Space Force unit; hence, there are squadron commanders, delta commanders, and commanders of field commands. In rank, a squadron commander is a lieutenant colonel, a delta commander is a colonel, and the commander of a field command is a major general or lieutenant general.

==Commander as a non-military rank or title==

===NASA rank===
In NASA spacecraft missions since the beginning of Project Gemini, one crew member on each spacecraft is designated as mission commander. The commander is the captain of the ship, and makes all real-time critical decisions on behalf of the crew and in coordination with the Mission Control Center (MCC).

=== Use in aviation ===
The title of aircraft commander is used in civil aviation to refer to the pilot in command (commonly referred to as &quot;captain&quot;, which is technically an airline rank and not related to the commander&#x27;s role on board the aircraft).

===British police rank===
Within the British police, Commander is a chief officer rank in the two police forces responsible for law enforcement within London, the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. In both forces, the rank is senior to chief superintendent; in the Metropolitan Police it is junior to deputy assistant commissioner and in the City of London Police it is junior to assistant commissioner. In forces outside London, the rank equates to assistant chief constable which bears the same insignia.

The Metropolitan Police introduced the rank in 1946, after the rank of deputy assistant commissioner was split in two, with senior DACs keeping that rank and title and junior DACs being regraded as commanders. The Metropolitan Police also used the rank of deputy commander, ranking just below that of commander, between 1946 and 1968.

Officers in charge of the twelve geographical Basic Command Units are referred to as &quot;BCU commander&quot;. However, the officers do not hold the rank of commander but instead hold the rank of chief superintendent. Prior to organisational change merging boroughs in to BCUs, officers in charge of policing each of the London&#x27;s boroughs were given the title &quot;borough commander&quot;. A previous exception to this was the borough commander of Westminster, who held the rank of commander due to the size, complexity, and high-profile nature of the borough.

The Metropolitan Police Service announced that by summer 2018 the rank would be phased out, along with that of chief inspector. However, in August 2017 it was announced that the new Commissioner Cressida Dick had cancelled the plan to phase them out.

The rank badge worn by a commander or an assistant chief constable consists of crossed tipstaves within a wreath. Within the Metropolitan Police Service, the tips of the tipstaves are blue and not red, unlike other forces. Until the abolition of the rank of deputy commander in 1968, however, a commander wore the same badge of rank as a deputy assistant commissioner.

===Australian police rank===
In Australia, commander is a rank used by the Victorian, Tasmanian, Western Australian, South Australian, and Australian Federal police forces. The insignia consists of a crown over three bath stars in a triangular formation, equivalent to a brigadier in the army. In all four forces, it is junior to the rank of assistant commissioner, and senior to the rank of chief superintendent, with the exception of Western Australia and Victoria where it is senior to the rank of superintendent.

In New South Wales the position of commander is instated to officers (usually superintendents) in charge of a command or unit.

===American police rank===

Some large police departments and sheriff&#x27;s offices in the US have a commander rank. Most commonly, this is the next rank above captain. Examples of this include the Chicago Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department, San Francisco Police Department, Portland Police Bureau and Rochester Police Department. In others, such as the Phoenix Police Department and Saint Paul Police Department, a commander rank is the next rank above lieutenant, and is equivalent to captain. In the Northport, Florida&#x27;s police department, however, commanders are below captains.

A commander in the LAPD is equivalent to an inspector in other large US departments (such as the NYPD); the LAPD rank was originally called inspector as well, but was changed in 1974 to commander. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia also uses the rank of commander, which is a grade above inspector and two grades above captain. In the Montgomery County, MD police department a commander is a captain assigned to command a police district. The Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office replaced the Assistant Chief rank with commander.

The insignia worn is commonly every insignia between major and major general, depending on the police or sheriff&#x27;s department. Albuquerque Police Department commanders are captain equivalents, however, with the brass version of the captain&#x27;s insignia. In some other police or sheriff&#x27;s departments where the captains have brass insignias instead of silver, such as Florida&#x27;s Lee County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, commanders are above captains, and below majors, with the insignia being brass captain&#x27;s bars with wreathes around. Northport&#x27;s police commanders have the insignia of second lieutenants. Commander is also used as a title in certain circumstances, such as the commander of a squad of detectives, who would usually be of the rank of lieutenant, and in some police or sheriff&#x27;s departments where commanders are ranks, officers or deputies of separate ranks are also referred to as commander by title.

===Canadian police rank===
The Montreal police force, Service de police de la Ville de Montréal, uses the rank of commander &quot;(Commandant)&quot;.

===Incident Command System===
In the Incident Command System the incident commander is in charge of the response to an emergency. The title may pass from person to person as the incident develops.

===Chivalric orders===

The title of commander is used in chivalric orders such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta for a member senior to a knight. The title of knight commander is often used to denote an even higher rank. These conventions are also used by most of the continental orders of chivalry. The United Kingdom uses different classifications.

In most of the British orders of knighthood, the grade of knight (or dame) commander is the lowest grade of knighthood, but is above the grade of companion (which does not carry a knighthood). In the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the British Empire, the grade of commander is senior to the grade of lieutenant or officer, but junior to that of knight or dame commander. In the British Venerable Order of Saint John, a commander ranks below a knight.

<text>The New Army (Traditional Chinese: 新軍, Simplified Chinese: 新军; Pinyin: Xīnjūn, Manchu: &quot;Ice cooha&quot;), more fully called the Newly Created Army ( &quot;Xinjian Lujun&quot;), was the combined modernised army corps formed under the Qing dynasty in December 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. At first it consisted of a few experimental units, but after 1901 it was envisioned as a regular and professional fully trained and equipped according to Western standards with a reserve. In 1903 an imperial edict expanded it to 36 divisions of 12,500 men each, or total of 450,000 in peacetime supplemented by a further 523,000 reservists in wartime though it never achieved a strength above 300,000.

==1895-1897==

There was a forerunner to the effort of modernising the Chinese army, created before the end of the Sino-Japanese War: in February 1895, the Qing court assembled its Dingwu or the Pacification Army ( &quot;Dingwu jun&quot;), consisting of 10 battalions or &quot;ying&quot; (), totaling 4,750 men. This was initially organized by and aided by German advisor Constantin von Hanneken. However, after one year of training, this force had not yet been trained sufficiently to meet western standards.

The command of this Pacification Army was turned over to Yuan Shikai by mid-December 1895, and within a few months was renamed the Newly Created Army ( &quot;Xinjian Lujun&quot;) and expanded to 7,000 men. (Yuan&#x27;s Newly Created Army was later to become the Guards Army&#x27;s Right Division (&quot;Wuwei Youjun&quot;).)

The monthly expenses of the brigade were 70,000 taels (840,000 taels annually).

The Newly Created Army (or simply the New Army) that was 7,000 men strong then became the most formidable of the three army groups stationed near Beijing and proved effective against the Boxers in Shandong province. Yuan refused to obey the Imperial Court&#x27;s orders to halt his suppression of the Boxers when the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China during the rebellion and refused to obey orders to fight the alliance.

The New Army was gradually expanded and upgraded in the following years. Yuan became increasingly disrespectful of the dynasty and only loyal to the party from which he benefited; his defection to Cixi against the Guangxu Emperor was a major blow to the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform. After 1900, Yuan&#x27;s troops were the only militia that the Qing court could rely on amidst revolutionary uprisings throughout China.

Following the disgracing of Li Hongzhang in the First Sino-Japanese War the Manchu Ronglu was made chief commander of the forces in Zhili and eventually Viceroy of Zhili in 1898 he was also minister of war for most of this period.

=== General reform ===
During and following the Qing defeat(s) in the First Sino-Japanese War many officials advocated reform of the military. Hu Yufen a progressive official, advocated for a completely new army to be trained and raised with 50,000 in the Beiyang region, 30,000 in the Nanyang region, 20,000 each in Guangdong and Hubei with the other provinces raising 10,000 each. For a total of 250,000 troops (Manchuria had not yet been organised into provinces).

Constantin von Hanneken a German advisor to the Qing military proposed raising 100,000 men this recommendation was supported by the Duban Junwu chu, or the War council assembled during the war, it then memorialised the Grand Council calling for reform whilst the Manchus of the Council supported the reform the Han members did not.

In response to von Hanneken&#x27;s proposal Sheng Xuanhuai proposed that due to the expenditure of the Green standard and the Yong YIng amounting to over 20mil taels each annually it would be better to disband these forces numbering some 800,000 and replace them with 300,000 western-style troops raised according to local conditions akin to the idea of Hu Yufen. However, the Zongli Yamen retorted that disbanding such a large army would be extremely difficult and came out in favour of a more gradual program of reform with modernisation being extended to the existing forces.

The Throne approved the creation of 2 German-style brigades but unlike previous reforms this was not a mere copy of drill and weapons but it followed German organisation patterns as well as German training and tactics in addition to drill and weaponry these were the Self-Strengthening Army of Zhang Zhidong and the Newly Created Army of Yuan Shikai.

=== 8 Banners ===
It is important to note that despite the criticism of the old-style and inefficient Green standard and Yong Ying were common there were no immediate proposals for reform of the 8 banners by the Han officials the Manchus still closely guarding the 8 banners.

In late 1895 Yinchang was ordered to choose and instruct Manchu officers at the Tianjin Military academy in anticipation of them taking command.

=== Military education ===
Zhang Zhidong declared in 1896 in a memorial to the Throne that the reason for German military pre-eminence was the universal education of its officer corps and asked for a military academy and railway school to be established in Nanjing this was approved and Zhang organised the training of 150 Chinese cadets under German instruction on a 3-year course involving techniques, strategy, tactics of the infantry, artillery engineers and both fortress and field artillery, surveying and cartography. The railway school enrolled 90 students. Zhang already possessed the relevant experience for educating officers via academies having introduced a similar program for education of officers in Liangguang during the Self-Strengthening Movement. The Nanjing Military academy cost 40,000 taels annually not including the attached railway school.

=== Newly created army and Yuan Shikai ===
Yuan was appointed as commander of the brigade in December 1895 and immediately began reform of the unit. The infantry was divided into 2 regiments with 2-3 battalions each, the artillery into 2 regiments with 2-3 battalions each with a QF, heavy and reserve component, the cavalry into 4 troops and the engineers into 6 groups based on their tasks. The 7,000 man upper strength limit was rapidly achieved by the unit. A German language school was established and 3 foreign officers instructed the cavalry, artillery and infantry, the upper organisation and staff components of the unit were also westernised as was the maintenance of telegraph communications and the introduction of night fighting something previously avoided by Chinese armies. To combat corruption Yuan instituted a new system where officers personally handed their funds to the soldiers under their command from Yuan&#x27;s own HQ under his personal supervision. Yuan like Zhang was one of the few Chinese officials who not only paid his troops well but actually paid them on time.

=== Pace of reform ===
The incompetence of the officers and the technical defincies of the military were routinely attacked by imperial censors and the Throne ordered the Board of War to deliberate on the matter of modernisation of the officer corps something not rectified until several years later with the abolition of the military examination.

The pace of reform and its extent was diluted and slowed by the corruption, favourtism and general negligence in the bureaucracy and the throne often issued edicts and demanded the bureaucrats fire the old, incompetent and weak and report them to the Board of Punishment but the bureaucrats rarely did this instead shielding one another especially at higher levels this did not create an environment conducive for reform.

Only minor increases in the number of modernised troops was made in the period from 1897 to the Boxer rebellion whilst the support for reform was almost universal even amongst the Tartar-Generals the actual extent of reform was minimal. The Tartar-General of Heilongjiang even praised the ability of his forces in fighting bandits and their lack of reform whilst simultaneously admitting they would be useless in true combat additionally, spears and bows were still commonplace and the Heilongjiang general complained that it was too expensive to equip his entire force with rifles and instead asked for permission to make breech loaded jingals a weapon similar in cost.

=== Other armies ===
General Nie Shicheng took 30 battalions of the yong ying and organised them into a 15,000 strong force based on German organisational patterns and established a military school where 2 Germans taught language and technical subjects, However Nie&#x27;s army whilst better than other Chinese armies did not approach that of Yuan&#x27;s or Zhang&#x27;s.

=== Finances ===
The estimates for the revenue of the central government range from 87,979,000 taels to 92,285,000, with roughly half the amount (45 million taels) going to the military including all forms of expenditure naval and land. The local armies navies and fortresses were estimated to cost 27,00,000 taels with 10,000,000 for the Beiyang and Nanyang fleets with 8,000,000 for the forts and their guns . The Board of War and Board of Revenue jointly reported the cost of the militia, Defense Army, Disciplined forces and new-style troops to cost over 20,000,000 taels the only accurate figures are that of expenditure on the arsenals at 3,385,000 taels the Green standard including the Disciplined forces (the modernised Green standard) were reportedly costing 10,000,000 taels annually and the Bannermen 4,000,000 taels and 1,000,000 piculs of rice (60,000,000 kg). The reason for the number of the breakdown exceeding the total is due to the significant overlapping between units and therefore their numbers and their related cost with provinces often subsidising other provinces and the central government also subsidising them whilst some provinces provided and received subsidies, for example in 1894 Zhejiang provided not only for its own military but also that of the Manchu and Chinese in Beijing, the Beiyang fleet and the cost of re-organisation in Manchuria.

== 1898-1900 ==

=== 100 days reform ===
The 100 Days reform initiated by the Guangxu emperor also affected military affairs as the Emperor desired a comprehensive reform of the state. The Throne complained of the lack of reform enacted in the provinces especially the continued corruption and military bloat caused by padded muster-rolls and the failure to disband the Green Standard Army, within the same edict the Throne called for new local militia and volunteer units to be raised and to replace the Green Standard; this was the same approach used 30 years earlier by Zeng Guofan and whilst it might have brought about a temporary boost to military power it would inevitably devolve back into corruption and stagnation as the Yong Ying had done. However, the throne did pass an edict on the recommendation of Hu Yufen to abolish the military exam which was agreed to be phased out by 1900, the 10,000 strong Peking Field Force left to languish since 1865 was to be given a refresher course in western-style training. However, when the experienced and more politically able Prince Gong (who avoided raising the ire of the conservatives) passed away the pace of reform accelerated even further. Weng Tonghe, the Emperor&#x27;s former tutor and a conservative the last such advisor to the Emperor was dismissed leaving the Grand Council entirely in the hands of the reformers, however the Emperor maintained Ronglu a conservative as the Viceroy of Zhili a mistake which he would regret and his position on the Board of War was given to the conservative K&#x27;ang-i. The Emperor even discussed the possibility of ordering the bannermen who were a drain on the state treasury to enter a different occupation and not live solely on the state stipend given to them. The Throne also ordered the provinces to disband the useless soldiers and the provinces raised their opposition some counter-proposed the reduction of militia and Green standard troops or stated that they had reduced their military forces to the extent that any further downsizing would constitute a danger. Ultimately, little military reform was enacted by the Guangxu Emperor during the brief period of reform.
A proposal for universal military training was proposed and approved by the Emperor in the largest departure from the traditional organisation of the military with all men in a given region being given military training and then act as a national reserve force for the military. The proposal was enacted with the most fervour in Southeastern China particularly Guangxi and Guangdong where the strength of the reformers was the most apparent. However, the Throne still did not take the lead even in this reform program instead delegating the program to the Viceroys and Governors who had in the previous decades failed to deliver thus it was likely for this program to end in failure too. The Emperor also decreed the adoption of modern drill and they were to possess true discipline and modern weapons with traditional weapons to be discarded. The Emperor took the Empress Dowager Cixi to inspect new army units but this did not prevent the Coup against the Emperor.

=== Cixi&#x27;s reforms ===
Cixi following the coup began improving her control over the military namely by maintaining the decentralised command of the military so as to deny any one official too much military power whilst simultaneously increasing the forces under her command and those under the control of the Manchus, she continued the adoption of western drill and the importation of weaponry but the necessary support services for a modern army remained neglected. Cixi continued and re-issued the edicts regarding the disbandment of old units however they continued to exist alongside the newer modern western-style units leading to a large cost which hindered further reform as the finances of the state could not simultaneously support a large modern army and a very large unmodernised army. Cixi however did maintain the loyalty of the troops something the Guangxu Emperor failed to achieve as she generously gave the troops of Yuan Dong and Nie money for their support against the Guangxu emperor and his reformers.

Ronglu, a Manchu, was given unprecedented military power being appointed simultaneously as Grand Councillor, Controller of the Board of war, Imperial Commissioner over the forces of Song Qing, Yuan Shikai, Nie Sicheng and Dong Fuxiang, thus centralising all forces around the capital under a loyalist Manchu official. The commander of the forces in the Beiyang region (the area around the Bohai bay), the new Manchu Viceroy, was to assist him. Cixi did not extend such centralisation to the other provinces but did continue the universal military service program ordering officials to encourage such organisations and to hire ex-bandits and criminals and give them a legitimate career in the military not conducive to an effective military but cheaper than fighting the bandits. Cixi re-instated the military exam on the path to abolishment by order of Guangxu adding a category on firearms in addition to archery and swordsmanship she did also turn down a request to abolish technical subjects in the provincial colleges and modern schools.

K&#x27;ang-i the President of the Board of war was sent on an inspection tour of 1899 to improve the defenses of Liangguang and to raise money in the aspect of finances he was successful being given the sobriquet &quot;imperial high extortioner&quot; by the foreign press.

==== Wuwei Corps ====
Ronglu proposed to the Throne that the Wuwei Corps be formed from 4 divisions (later expanded to 5 with the additional Centre division) the Throne agreed and the Corps was formed the 5 Divisions being the Centre under Ronglu, the Front of Nie Shicheng trained by Germans then Russians and armed with Mauser rifles artillery and Maxim guns but poorly disciplined, the Left of Song Qing possessed similar arms to the Front division, the Rear of Dong Fuxiang poorly equipped and armed but potentially useful and the Right of Yuan Shikai of the 5 divisions Yuan was regarded as the best force among them all. Cixi further ordered the training of 12,000 Anhui army soldiers and 19,000 Disciplined army soldiers for an additional 31,000.

The 5 divisions were to have 8 ying (battalions) 5 of infantry and 1 each of cavalry, artillery and engineers each division was to also have a training battalion attached with each battalion having 4 companies of 250 (old-style formations had their Ying at 500 nominally in practice around 300) again the aims were not met and only the Centre and Right divisions actually conformed to the new organisation. Ronglu also obtained large amounts of funds some 400,000 taels from the Hubu for his force of 10,000 (on paper) simultaneously the Banner army at least 200,000 and potentially up to 350,000 strong had less than 5 million taels and many officers were transferred from across the empire to this army at Ronglu&#x27;s request.

==== Arms importation 1895-1900 ====
The Qing government recognised the weakness of its domestic armaments industry and sought foreign imports to bridge the gap. In 1899 the Imperial Army ordered 460,000 Mauser rifles and 3,000,000 cartridges and by 1900 the Qing had imported some 207 machine guns, 71 fortress guns and 123 field guns with another 200 Krupp mountain guns being ordered.

== 1901-1903 ==

=== Command and education ===
Zhang Zhidong and Liu Kunyi jointly proposed the formation of an Imperial General Staff modelled on the Japanese equivalent and that the chief of the General Staff be a competent professional soldier not just a Noble or Imperial Clansmen this could have centralised military forces and allowed for a standardisation of training, pay and equipment and become an engine of reform however the Throne did not approve it until 1909. Though the 2 officials did get the Throne to abolish the military exam in 1901 replacing it with direct application to provincial armies by the 2nd and 3rd rank and to await enrollment in military schools in the expectation of their establishment, to obtain a steady and large flow of trained officers an edict mandated all provinces to open military academies and those with academies (Yuan, Zhang and Liu) were to create a national regulation regarding military education. In 1902 even bannermen were obligated to attend the Military schools though the Imperial Guardsmen were still tested in their proficiency with the bow.

=== Organisational reform ===
The throne also ordered once again to demobilise the Green Standard and militia to a more efficient force by discharging the useless. The remaining forces were then to be organised into a standing army (Changbei Jun) a first reserve (Xubei jun) and a gendarmerie (Xunjing jun). Standing army units were to gradually proliferate across the Empire and to then later form the new army (Lujun) the reserves served as a safe haven for the old-style units allowing them to continue existing despite repeated orders to disband them. In 1902 the Throne informed the provinces once again of their intent to demobilise the greater portion of the Green Standard and that land formerly allotted to the maintenance of soldiers in substitution of pay would devolve back to the Throne. The reform edicts were not followed as the Throne complained in 1902 that the Manchu-Generals, Viceroys and Governors were dragging their heels.

The increasing uselessness of the Bannermen spurred the Throne into action as military power increasingly became Han Chinese the Throne sought to balance this, Yuan Shikai was ordered to train 3,000 Bannermen and later it was planned for an additional 3,000 to be trained. Ronglu also was rumoured to have begun the training of 30,000 bannermen in 1901, but his death ended this before it even began.

The Throne also ordered that the green standard and braves be reduced by 20-30% in within a year. Given the lack of reliable figures this would amount from 200,000-400,000 men being dismissed by the army, a large decrease equivalent to the entire standing armies of other countries. Given these troops were of little real military value, this represented a great cost saving measure.

=== Beiyang army ===
Yuan Shikai as commander of the army was ordered to form 2 divisions one of which was to be Manchu instead Yuan trained the one Manchu division and prepared a corps of 4 divisions 3 of which were Han Chinese. The 2 initial divisions were to form a Corps of 19,120 men organised into 42 battalions with a total annual cost of 2,387,600 taels not including armament. Yuan Shikai hired Japanese instructors and advisors and established many schools offering diverse courses such as topography and ballistics as well as sending cadets to be educated in Japan.

=== Hubei army ===
Zhang had organised a bodyguard of 7,750 modern trained men organised into 1 brigade of 11 battalions 8 infantry and 1 each of cavalry, artillery and engineers, however Captain Gadoffre reported that there were 14,750 foreign-trained men whilst Zhang reported 9,500 to the throne. In Hubei there were 15,700 modern trained troops including 7,000 Bannermen and 42,000 soldiers described as &quot;armed coolies&quot; Zhang had also standardised the armament of his forces using the Hanyang Arsenal and arms imported from Germany. Gaddofre also reported that the modern units were proficient in drill and on the parade ground but in sustained exercises and manoeuvres the control over units broke down, artillery was underutilised generally and marksmanship was mediocre. Zhang began to transfer the modern officers from his bodyguard to the Provincial forces only for these officers to neglect their foreign principles and revert to their old ways, this spurred the formation of military schools for Commissioned and Non-Commissioned officers.

=== Other provincial reforms ===
Liu Kunyi as Viceroy of Liangjiang controlled the vital lower Yangtze region and began to organise new military forces. Liu used the Defense Army (yong ying) to organise 2 standing Army units the remaining 40 battalions were to be re-organised as first-class reserves. However, Liu maintained the old-style organisation in his bodyguard his troops were ill-trained and ill-equipped and trained officers were not given admittance to the formation. Liu also organised military schools similar to Zhang Zhidong&#x27;s but used Chinese graduates from these schools to train his men rather than directly by foreigners and all officers under the rank of Lt. Col were ordered to partake in lectures on military science.

In other provinces modernisation was limited to the German goosestep and issuing men repeating rifles though men were organised into standing army and first-class reserves across the empire but not universally and even this change was often just one in name and the new organisation was not followed.

== 1904-1907 ==
The previous reforms were deemed insufficient and in the face of the Russo-Japanese war the Throne acted much more decisively and formed the Commission for Army reorganisation disparaging the fact that whilst reform had been called for little of substance had been achieved and it became necessary for the Throne to centralise reform and enact it centrally Prince Qing was named director and Yuan Shikai and Tieh&#x27;liang as assistant directors.
=== Organisation ===

==== Lujun ====
A division of the Changbei Jun was to consist of 2 infantry brigades a cavalry and artillery regiment, an engineer and transport battalion and a band. Each Brigade was to possess 2 regiments which itself contained 3 battalions and with 4 companies per battalion and 3 platoons per company and below platoon strength organisation varied. A Mixed Brigade possessed 2 infantry regiments an artillery and cavalry battalion and an engineer and transport company. An infantry division was to possess (excluding officers) 12,500 men a brigade 3,024 a regiment 1,512, battalions 504 men, companies 168 men and platoons 42 men. A cavalry regiment was to possess 864 men (including officers). An artillery regiment was to possess 3 battalions with 3 batteries each with each battery possessing 141 men (including officers) and 6 guns. This made a total of 54 guns and 1,269 men.

An alternate table of organisation is given for the division:

The division contains 2 infantry brigades each with 2 regiments and each with 3 battalions. One regiment of artillery with 54 guns and 18 machine guns, one regiment of cavalry of 12 squadrons, 1 engineer battalion of 4 companies, one logistics battalion of 4 companies, 51 musicians and an unspecified amount of gendarmerie. With 12,512 men in peacetime and 21,000 in wartime.

An infantry battalion in peacetime contain 659 men and when mobilised 1,240, a company of 154 men in peacetime and 299 in wartime. A cavalry squadron 81 men. An artillery regiment 1,136 men an engineer battalion 667 men in peacetime and 1,250 when mobilised, a logistics company 748 men in peacetime with 1,640 when mobilised.

Thus a division when fully mobilised would include 14,880 riflemen, 54 guns and 18 machine guns with 1,136 gunners, 1,250 engineers, 1,640 logistics personnel, 972 cavalry and 51 musicians giving a total manpower of 19,927 the balance likely constituting divisional level officers and the attached gendarme.

A division of the Xubei jun was to contain the same organisation but its regiments had 2 battalions rather than 3 this would give a total strength of 9,840 men. The Houbei jun only fielded a brigade of 4 battalions 2,016 men numbered with its parent division.

==== Xunfangdui ====
The Reserve troops consisted of the former Luying (Green Standard troops) and Braves (yong ying) they were re-designated as reserve troops in 1907. The reserve troops were to serve as a militarised police in peacetime and auxiliary troops to the line troops in times of war. Each province was not permitted to maintain more than 50 battalions of infantry or cavalry. An infantry battalion consisted of 301 men and a cavalry battalion of 189 men and 135 horses. Thus a province if it fielded solely infantry battalions it would field 15,050 (331,100 nationally) or only cavalry 9,450 (207,900).

==== Gendarmerie ====
These functioned as the military police of the empire. One battalion was organised in 1908 consisting of 299 men and 82 horses.

=== Proposal by Sir Robert Hart ===
Robert Hart the Inspector-General of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service reasoned that the Qing weakness allowing Russia and Japan to wage war in Manchuria was due to fiscal weakness he therefore proposed a uniform land tax at a low rate that would yield 400,000,000 taels to the Dynasty to be controlled by the Central Government. This money would firstly be used to form 4 armies of 50,000 each with each army supported by first and second class reserves. Then 3 modern squadrons of warships could be obtained and the establishment of 4 modern arsenals could be organised to produce equipment and 4 military schools to produce officers. The military would cost 90,000,000 taels and 160,000,000 taels would be spent on affording good pay to reduce the need for officials to rely on corruption to support themselves. The proposal was rejected due to provincial opposition though they were not revolutionary as previous similar proposals were made by the Throne and officials themselves but not acted upon.

=== Report of the Imperial army commission ===
The report called for the implementation of a western and Japanese style army system in China and to maintain a middle path between over and underspending respectively. The general purpose was standardisation and modernisation of all areas of the army from organisation and pay to training and equipment. The basic system of provincially managed armies that could be mobilised in wartime was maintained but with new formations and supported by a centralised logistical system, thus recruitment training and finances of the new troops were held by the provinces but the overall command was invested at the higher echelons of government. The commission detailed the various weaknesses of the military and ways to rectify them with the notable exception of the 8 banners. Each province was ordered to assemble a provincial staff and a brigade of new army troops.

Recommendations of the commission:

* A specialised educated officers corps for staff and line officers with academy trained officers given priority with higher pay to cover their actual cost of living and to clamp down on their corruption.
* A more vigorous system of inspections
* The issuance of a detailed regulations book detailing the responsibility of officers and their duties and to control the units effectively, the reliance on drill instructors was to be phased out when academy officers were made available.
* Strict recruiting standards requiring 20% to be literate to potentially become NCOs. Only troops aged 20–25 of a height of 5 ft 6.5 inches in Northern China and 5 ft 4 inches in Southern China capable of lifting 133 lbs in good health and not addicted to opium was to be recruited.
* A pension system in the event of death or disability and one for ex-servicemen, encouragement of an esprit de corps.
* Implementation of an adequate logistical and medical service from first-aid to military hospitals and a logistics chain capable of operating from interior depots right to the fighting units. 
* Equipment standardisation was also highlighted, the most modern yet simple and durable weapons were to be used by the army. Uniforms were standardised with black for the winter and Khaki for the summer. Though the commission&#x27;s goal of standardisation in 5 years was overly optimistic. 
* The Army (Lu-Jun) was to be divided into 3 categories. The standing army (Changbei jun), the 1st class reserves (Xubei jun) and the 2nd class reserves (Houbei jun). Service in the Changbei jun was to be for 3 years with a monthly pay of 4.2 taels, the Xubei jun had a service term of 3 years with drill at allotted times with pay of 1 tael a month when not actively serving, and the Houbei jun had a service term of 4 years with less allotted training with a monthly pay of half a tael except when actively serving. 
* Organisation was to be a division of 12,512 men (748 officers, 10,436 NCO and enlisted and 1,328 support). A corps was to possess 1,595 officers and 23,760 enlisted men with a Corps allotted 4,469 horses and 108 pieces of artillery. 
* Standardised naming Dajun for an army, jun for a corps, Zhen for a division, biao for a regiment, ying for a battalion (or cavalry squadron), dui for a company, troop or battery and pai for a platoon. 
* It was estimated by the commission that a single division would cost 1,300,000 taels and a Corps 2,778,222.76 taels excluding weapons, equipment, barracks. 
* 36 divisions were to be formed by 1922 with a total strength of approximately 450,000 and a cost of 48,000,000 taels. This was later amended to 1913.

==== Military schools ====
The Commission and the Throne in turn accepted the fact that this new army would require a trained and educated officers corps in order to be worthwhile and effective. Therefore, they jointly ordered the establishment of primary military schools in each province, 4 intermediate schools, an officer&#x27;s school and a General Staff College. Following this there were plans for the establishment of technical and specialist schools. However, NCOs were also targeted for education with NCO schools established and training battalions formed with the express purpose of training NCOs. To prevent the senior officers from holding back junior officers and maintaining old military thought senior officers were to also receive modern military instruction at the provincial capitals.

The process to create an officer began aged 15 with enrollment in the primary/junior primary schools each province, the bannermen and the Capital hosted one of these schools enrolling from 90 to 300 students each, then enroll as a cadet for 3 years in the basic military school to obtain general knowledge and learn fundamentals of the military sciences, then they would attend the intermediate school for 2 years (in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Hubei and Zhili) which would include a civilian and military curriculum. The cadets would then be obligated to serve 4 months in the ranks then spend 18 months in the officer&#x27;s school at Baoding which had a total enrollment of 1,140 officers, then 6 additional months in the ranks then receive their commission provided they graduated the course. If the now commissioned officers rendered 2 years of exceptional service they would then attend the General Staff College course, which had a total enrollment of 40, for 2 years and become General Staff Corps Officers. This model of military education was similar to that used in contemporary Japan and would have produced educated competent officers steadily within a decade.

===== Military school for Princes and Nobles =====
This military school offered military officer training for 5 years (reduced to 3) to 120 students. Only certain privileged persons were allowed to attend including the sons of nobles, clansmen above the 4th rank, Metropolitan and provincial Manchu and Chinese military and civil officials of the 2nd rank and higher and be aged 18–25. Those who pass with the highest grade were immediately commissioned as Lieutenants.

=== Implementation of reform ===

==== Zhili ====
The reforms listed above were the theoretical basis and the implementation of reform in reality differed greatly in practice. In 1904-1905 Yuan Shikai attempted to raise 10,000 men roughly a division but was blocked by the board of revenue as the figure of 3,000,000 taels required was seen as too heavy a burden. However, Yuan pursuant to the plan begin the training of large numbers of officers in his military schools. In light of the Russo-Japanese war Yuan consolidated the disparate forces in Zhili forming 3 divisions of Chinese and a brigade of bannermen which was to be increased with additional battalions. Yuan&#x27;s troops attracted praise being compared to US troops in accuracy and of being well-armed with modern Mauser rifles. Yuan held divisional level in late 1904 manoeuvres with 2 divisions and the Manchu brigade a total of 13,100 men a key indicator in the quality of troops this led to 2 additional divisions being raised in 1905 for a total of 5 divisions and the Manchu brigade. In late 1905 Yuan changed his troops from the Beiyang organisation to the Lujun organisation as per the imperial military regulations.
===== 1905 manoeuvres =====
In 1905 the 6 divisions or elements of them all participated in a corps level manoeuvre and war games with 1 corps opposing another though exact figures of participants varies from 23,600 to 50,000 per the official regulations there would be 50,710 men in the manoeuvres praise was forthcoming from the press but the military observers were less impressed and issues were still common especially in the senior officers with a lack of strategic and tactical thought at senior levels whilst the junior officers performed better and the majority of the NCOs were still not trained at all. However, the common soldier received the most praise for being well-drilled and more like a respectable soldier and not the armed and uniformed bandit of the past this led to a growing respect for the military amongst the populace at large with even senior officials like Yuan Shikai and Tieh-liang the respective corps commanders in the manoeuvres appearing in Corps commander attire and not civilian attire. The infantry was well praised the artillery officers were criticised as was the cavalry which was regarded as being better utilised as mounted infantry than anything else, the engineers due a lack of training were not utilised besides some bridge building the use of some telegraph and telephone lines was also noted as was the utilisation of the Beijing-Hankou railway to move 2 divisions a major step forward as a major weakness of the Qing military was its inability to mobilise troops quickly during wartime. Thus in a few years Yuan had shown considerable progress fielding 2 western-style corps with modern equipment and moderate ability with a large potential for growth.

==== Hubei ====
Zhang Zhidong had raised 11,500 new-style troops by 1904 but these did not conform to the regulations of organisation dictated to him instead he raised only 2 regiments of infantry and smaller support units divided into 2 brigades though these troops were a mix of trained men and raw recruits they still remained far superior to all other troops in the Yangtze river valley. Zhang noting the strategic position of Huguang stated that he should have 3 or 4 divisions but this was beyond his financial capacity and instead proposed raising 1 division and 1 mixed brigade of reduced strength before an eventual expansion to 2 full divisions when funding was available. Zhang taking into account the numerous hills and waterways of Huguang aimed to reduce non-combatants especially logistical troops and replace field with mountain guns this would reduce his division to 12,071 and his brigades to 5,180 a reduction of several hundred men in each and be over 300,000 taels cheaper this was approved by the throne and Zhang was allowed to form his smaller division and mixed brigade. The division was ready by April 1906 and the mixed brigade by the end of the year there was also an additional 18,000 soldiers in Hubei not including police forces or militia a reminder of the main issue facing the Qing where insufficient funding was due to the number of old troops needed to keep the peace and therefore halting the formation of new style troops who were needed to protect the country.

==== Other provinces ====
In Jiangsu the 7th division remained understrength at only brigade strength (~5000 men), the 9th division at Nanjing was only 3 infantry regiments (~4500), the 10th division in Fuzhou contained 6 infantry and 1 artillery battalions and 2 engineer companies (~5,400). The 25th Brigade in Hunan was almost identical to the 10th division (~5,400). The 27th brigade in Jiangsu had 2 infantry regiments and an understrength cavalry squadron (~4,000), the 29th brigade at Kaifeng contained a mix of troops and on paper was at full-strength (~3,000). The 31st brigade in Anhui contained only 2,000 infantry. Other formations were authorised but did not exist, however there existed the 4,400 canton brigade and 6,400 men of the Guards who were considered modern troops too.

=== Officer class ===
By 1906 the military had 35 schools with a total enrollment of 787 officers 3,448 officer cadets and 2,072 NCOs with an additional 691 training in Japan and 15 in Europe and given naval officers were instructed in land warfare additionally 350 midshipmen could be added to the enrollment. The Baoding academy offered veterinary schooling with Hubei and Zhili offering all specialised training, Baoding, Chengdu and Guangzhou offered medical training. A general training course included Chinese history and literature, a foreign language (usually German or Japanese and occasionally English), math, the sciences, geography, general history and military science. The instructors were usually Japanese, Japanese-instructed Chinese and Germans (though these were noted as being undesirable in Germany) and thus their contracts were rarely renewed, Zhili, Anhui and Hubei produced the best officers though even these remained inferior to those trained in Japan on paper. However, many of the officers were still civil officials, elderly officers without training, Green standard army officers simply shifted in, unqualified naval officers, and civilian students returned from abroad.

==Renaming and revolution==

The Chien Men gate refers to the Zhengyangmen.

The successful example of the new army was followed in other provinces. The New Army of Yuan was renamed the Beiyang Army on June 25, 1902, after Yuan was officially promoted to the &quot;Minister of Beiyang&quot;. By the end of the dynasty in 1911, most provinces had established sizable new armies; however, Yuan&#x27;s army was still most powerful, comprising six groups and numbering more than 75,000 men. The Qing unified all of China&#x27;s armies into one force, the &quot;Chinese Army&quot;, which was commonly still called the New Army. Two-thirds of the Chinese Army was Yuan&#x27;s Beiyang Army.

During the Xinhai Revolution, most of the non-Beiyang forces as well as some Beiyang units in the Chinese Army revolted against the Qing. Yuan led the Beiyang Army into opposing the revolution while also negotiating for the Qing&#x27;s surrender and his ascendency to the presidency of the new republic.

==Politics and modernisation==
Yuan kept a tight grip on the command of the army after its establishment by installing officials only loyal to him; however, after his death in 1916, the army groups were quickly fragmented into four major forces of combative warlords, according to the locations of garrisons. These army groups and generals played different roles in the politics of the Republic of China until the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China following the Communist Party of China&#x27;s victory in the Chinese Civil War.

One of the most important legacies of the New Army was the professionalisation of the military and perhaps introduction of militarism to China. Previously, almost any male could join and soldiers were mostly poor, landless and illiterate peasants. The New Armies moved beyond the personalised recruitment and patronage of Zeng Guofan and Zuo Zongtang, which had been successful in the mid-century uprisings, but seemed discredited in the face of modern armies in Japan and the West. The New Army began screening volunteers and created modern military academies to train officers. The modernisation and professionalisation of the New Army impressed many in the gentry class to join. The young Chiang Kai-shek, for instance, briefly attended Yuan&#x27;s Baoding Military Academy, which thus influenced him in forming his Whampoa Academy, which trained a succeeding generation of soldiers. Yuan and his successors equated military dominance of the political sphere with national survival. The political army would become a dominant force in China for much of the twentieth century.

== Zhang Zhidong in Liangjiang ==
Following the disastrous performance of the Qing armies in the First Sino-Japanese War Zhang zhidong the then Viceroy of Liangjiang stated in a memorial that he intended to raise a 10,000 strong German-trained army with 8 infantry battalions of 250, 2 artillery battalions of 200, 2 cavalry battalions of 180 and 1 engineer battalion of 100 men with more men including doctors, veterinarians and armourers but no support staff such as quarter-masters, transportation or signal units. 35 Germans were to serve in the new army not as instructors but as actual commanders of the units. Every 6 months the German officers were to rotate to a new group of soldiers matching the numbers listed above and to train these men thus in 2 years Zhang Zhidong was to possess 10,000 crack German-trained soldiers it was estimated the 10,000 strong force would cost 440,000 taels annually. The memorial was approved however the force was transferred to Liu Kunyi who did not raise the army beyond its original group and increase it to the proposed 10,000 men as the throne feared provincial officials commanding powerful armies and wanted the force under the more conservative Liu.

<text>In property law, title is an intangible construct representing a bundle of rights in (to) a piece of property in which a party may own either a legal interest or equitable interest. The rights in the bundle may be separated and held by different parties. It may also refer to a formal document, such as a deed, that serves as evidence of ownership. Conveyance of the document (transfer of title to the property) may be required in order to transfer ownership in the property to another person. Title is distinct from possession, a right that often accompanies ownership but is not necessarily sufficient to prove it (for example squatting). In many cases, possession and title may each be transferred independently of the other. For real property, land registration and recording provide public notice of ownership information.

&quot;Possession&quot; is the actual holding of a thing, whether or not one has any right to do so. The &quot;right of possession&quot; is the legitimacy of possession (with or without actual possession), evidence for which is such that the law will uphold it unless a better claim is proven. The &quot;right of property&quot; is that right which, if all relevant facts are known (and allowed), defeats all other claims. Each of these may be in a different person.

For example, suppose A steals from B something that B had previously bought in good faith from C and that C had earlier stolen from D and that had been an heirloom of D&#x27;s family for generations but had originally been stolen centuries earlier (though this fact is now forgotten by all) from E. Here A has the possession, B has an &quot;apparent&quot; right of possession (as evidenced by the purchase), D has the &quot;absolute&quot; right of possession (being the best claim that can be proven), and the heirs of E, if they knew it, would have the right of property, which they however could not prove. A good title consists of the combination of these three (possession, right of possession, and right of property) in the same person(s).

The extinguishing of ancient, forgotten, or unasserted claims, such as E&#x27;s in the example above, was the original purpose of statutes of limitations. Otherwise, title to property would always be uncertain.

== Equitable versus legal title ==
At common law, equitable title is the right to obtain full ownership of property, where another maintains legal title to the property. In the United States, legal titles are those that were recognized by the law courts in England. Equitable titles were those recognized by the English chancery courts. Both of these concepts were adopted by the various states upon their creation except, possibly, those based upon European Civil Law, such as Louisiana. Most states have merged the law and equity courts into a single court system, although there may still be law and chancery divisions in some of the systems.
When a contract for the sale of land is executed, equitable [interest/title] passes to the seller to the buyer. When the conditions on the sale contract have been met, legal title passes to the buyer in what is known as closing. In England and Wales, the terms &quot;purchaser&quot; and &quot;vendor&quot; are used. Properties that are sold on the basis of equitable title have a legal chain of title intact, and a recorded transfer with the local municipality. Legal title is actual ownership of the property as when the property has been bought, the seller paid in full and a deed or title is properly recorded. Equitable title separates from legal title upon the death of the legal title holder (owner). For example: When a person having legal title to property dies, heirs at law or beneficiaries per the last will, automatically receive an equitable interest in the property. When an executor or administrator qualifies, that person acquires the legal title, subject to divestment when the estate has been administered so as to allow for the lawful passing of the legal title to those having an equitable interest. The resulting merger of the legal and equitable gives rise to the &quot;perfect title&quot;, often referred to as marketable title.

Legal and equitable title also arises in trust. In a trust, one person may own the legal title, such as the trustees. Another person may own the equitable title such as the beneficiary.

In countries with a sophisticated private property system, documents of title are commonly used for real estate, motor vehicles, and some types of intangible property. When such documents are used, they are often part of a registration system whereby ownership of such property can be verified. In some cases, a title can also serve as a permanent legal record of condemnation of property, such as in the case of an automobile junk or salvage title. In the case of real estate, the legal instrument used to transfer title from one person or entity to another is via the deed. A famous rule is that a thief cannot convey good title, so title searches are routine (or highly recommended) for purchases of many types of expensive property (especially real estate). In several counties and municipalities in the US a standard title search (generally accompanied by title insurance) is required under the law as a part of ownership transfer.

Paramount title is the best title in fee simple available for the true owner. The person who is owner of real property with paramount title has the higher (or better, or &quot;superior&quot;) right in an action to quiet title. This concept is inherently a relative one. Paramount title is not always the best (or highest) title, since it is necessarily based on some other person&#x27;s title.

A quiet title action is a lawsuit to resolve with any cloud on title, such as competing claims or rights to real property, for example, missing heirs, tenants, reverters, remainders and lien holders all competing to get ownership to the house or land. Technical problems with title include misspellings, outstanding debt, unrecorded transactions, and any irregularity that might indicate a break in the chain of ownership. Each of the United States have different procedures for a &quot;quiet title action&quot;.

However, most personal property items do not have a formal document of title. For such items, possession is the simplest indication of title, unless the circumstances give rise to suspicion about the possessor&#x27;s ownership of the item. Proof of legal acquisition, such as a bill of sale or purchase receipt, is contributory. The transfer of possession to a good faith purchaser will normally convey title if no document is required.

==Application by jurisdiction==
===Philippines===
Development and subdivision of real estate property may occur while its title is under dispute from another party. If a suit is resolved in favor of a plaintiff, this renders uncertain the circumstances that allowed the said development to occur, and may result in the resources invested going to waste.

The case of &quot;Paxton v. Virata et al.&quot;, wherein a forgery of a title led to the establishment of the Viva Homes Estate residential subdivision in Dasmariñas, Cavite, in the Philippines, has turned an entire gated community an informal settlement, making residents who have invested decades into null and void titles worried about demolition.

===United States===
In United States law, evidence of title is typically established through title reports written up by title insurance companies, which show the history of title (property abstract and chain of title) as determined by the recorded public record deeds; the title report will also show applicable encumbrances such as easements, liens, or covenants. In exchange for insurance premiums, the title insurance company conducts a title search through public records and provides assurance of good title, reimbursing the insured if a dispute over the title arises. In the case of vehicle ownership, a simple vehicle title document may be issued by a governmental agency.

The main rights in the title bundle are usually:
* Exclusive possession
* Exclusive use and enclosure
* Acquisition
* Conveyance, including by bequest
* Access easement
* Hypothecation
* Partition

The rights in real property may be separated further, examples including:
* Water rights, including riparian rights and runoff rights
* In some U.S. states, water rights are completely separate from land—see prior appropriation water rights
* Mineral rights
* Easement to neighboring property, for utility lines, etc.
* Tenancy or tenure in improvements
* Timber rights
* Farming rights
* Grazing rights
* Hunting rights
* Air rights
* Development rights to erect improvements under various restrictions
* Appearance rights, often subjected to local zoning ordinances and deed restrictions

==== Prohibitions on acquisition of title ====
California prevented aliens (mainly Asians) from holding title to land until the law was declared unconstitutional in 1952. Currently there are no restrictions on foreign ownership of land in the United States, although sales of real estate by non-resident aliens are subject to certain special taxation rules.

== Aboriginal title ==

Prior to the establishment of the United States, title to Indian lands in lands controlled by Britain in North America was governed by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763. This proclamation by King George III reserved title in land to the Indians, subject to alienation only by the Crown. This continued to be the law of Canada following the American Revolution.

In the United States, Indian title is the subservient title held by Native Americans in the United States to the land they customarily claimed and occupied. It was first recognized in .It very early became accepted doctrine in this Court that although fee title to lands occupied by Indians when the colonists arrived became vested in the sovereign – first the discovering European nation and later the original states and the United States – a right of occupancy in the Indian tribes was nevertheless recognized. That right, sometimes called Indian Title and good against all but the sovereign, could be terminated only by sovereign act. Once the United States was organized and the Constitution adopted, these tribal rights to Indian lands became the exclusive province of the federal law. Indian title, recognized to be only a right of occupancy, was extinguishable only by the United States.
&quot;Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida&quot; , 414 U.S. 661, 667 (1974).

The usual method of extinguishing Indian title was by treaty.

<doc id="226187" wikidata="Q1424492" url="?curid=226187" title="Prandtl–Glauert singularity">
<text>The Prandtl–Glauert singularity is a theoretical construct in flow physics, often incorrectly used to explain vapor cones in transonic flows.
It is the prediction by the Prandtl–Glauert transformation that infinite pressures would be experienced by an aircraft as it approaches the speed of sound. Because it is invalid to apply the transformation at these speeds, the predicted singularity does not emerge. The incorrect association is related to the early-20th-century misconception of the impenetrability of the sound barrier.

The Prandtl–Glauert transformation assumes linearity (i.e. a small change will have a small effect that is proportional to its size). This assumption becomes inaccurate toward Mach 1 and is entirely invalid in places where the flow reaches supersonic speeds, since sonic shock waves are instantaneous (and thus manifestly non-linear) changes in the flow. Indeed, one assumption in the Prandtl–Glauert transformation is approximately constant Mach number throughout the flow, and the increasing slope in the transformation indicates that very small changes will have a very strong effect at higher Mach numbers, thus violating the assumption, which breaks down entirely at the speed of sound.

This means that the singularity featured by the transformation near the sonic speed (&quot;M=1&quot;) is not within the area of validity. The aerodynamic forces are calculated to approach infinity at the so-called &quot;Prandtl–Glauert singularity&quot;; in reality, the aerodynamic and thermodynamic perturbations do get amplified strongly near the sonic speed, but they remain finite and a singularity does not occur. The Prandtl–Glauert transformation is a linearized approximation of compressible, inviscid potential flow. As the flow approaches sonic speed, the nonlinear phenomena dominate within the flow, which this transformation completely ignores for the sake of simplicity.

== Prandtl–Glauert transformation ==

The Prandtl–Glauert transformation is found by linearizing the potential equations associated with compressible, inviscid flow. For two-dimensional flow, the linearized pressures in such a flow are equal to those found from incompressible flow theory multiplied by a correction factor. This correction factor is given below:
formula_1
where
* &quot;c&quot;&quot;p&quot; is the compressible pressure coefficient
* &quot;c&quot;&quot;p&quot;0 is the incompressible pressure coefficient
* &quot;M&quot;∞ is the freestream Mach number.

This formula is known as &quot;Prandtl&#x27;s rule&quot;, and works well up to low-transonic Mach numbers (&quot;M&quot; &lt; ~0.7). However, note the limit:
formula_2

This obviously nonphysical result (of an infinite pressure) is known as the Prandtl–Glauert singularity.

== Reason for condensation clouds ==

The reason that observable clouds sometimes form around high speed aircraft is that humid air is entering low-pressure regions, which also reduces local density and temperature sufficiently to cause water to supersaturate around the aircraft and to condense in the air, thus creating clouds. The clouds vanish as soon as the pressure increases again to ambient levels.

In the case of objects at transonic speeds, the local pressure increase happens at the shock wave location.
Condensation in free flow does not require supersonic flow. Given sufficiently high humidity, condensation clouds can be produced in purely subsonic flow over wings, or in the cores of wing tips, and even within, or around vortices themselves. This can often be observed during humid days on aircraft approaching or departing airports.

<text>In government and politics, inauguration is the process of swearing a person into office and thus making that person the incumbent. Such an inauguration commonly occurs through a formal ceremony or special event, which may also include an inaugural address by the new official.

The word &quot;inauguration&quot; stems from the Latin &quot;augur&quot;, which refers to the rituals of ancient Roman priests seeking to interpret if it was the will of the gods for a public official to be deemed worthy to assume office.

==Public office==
The inaugurations of public figures, especially those of political leaders, often feature ceremonies in which the figure publicly takes their oath of office (sometimes called &quot;swearing in&quot;), often in front of a large crowd of spectators. A monarchical inauguration may take on different forms depending on the nation: they may undergo a coronation rite or may simply be required to take an oath in the presence of a country&#x27;s legislature.

The &quot;inaugural address&quot; is a speech given during this ceremony which informs the people of their intentions as a leader. A famous inauguration speech is John F. Kennedy&#x27;s.

<text>The Black Watch is a 1929 American sound (All-Talking) pre-Code adventure epic film directed by John Ford and starring Victor McLaglen, Myrna Loy, and David Torrence. It was written by James Kevin McGuinness and based on the 1916 novel &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot; by Talbot Mundy. The film features an uncredited 21-year-old John Wayne working as an extra; he also worked in the arts and costume department for the film. This was director John Ford&#x27;s first sound film.
==Plot==
A captain in the British Army&#x27;s Black Watch regiment is assigned to a secret mission in India just as his company is called to France at the outbreak of war in August 1914. His covert assignment results in his being considered a coward by his fellows, a suspicion confirmed when he becomes involved in a drunken brawl in India that results in the apparent death of another officer.

<doc id="226190" wikidata="Q884030" url="?curid=226190" title="Administrative divisions of Venezuela">
<text>Venezuela is divided into 23 states &quot;(estados)&quot;, 1 Capital District &quot;(Distrito Capital)&quot; and the Federal Dependencies &quot;(Dependencias Federales de Ultramar)&quot; that consist of numerous Venezuelan islands. These administrative divisions are grouped into regions.

== Historical subdivisions ==
Prior to the Federal War (1859–1863), Venezuela was divided into provinces rather than states. The victorious forces were supposed to grant more autonomy to the individual states, but this was not implemented.

Between 1863 and the early 1900s, there were numerous territorial changes, including the merger and splitting of states. Thereafter, until the late 1990s, the states were left unchanged. Recent years have seen the creation of three new states: Delta Amacuro, Amazonas, and Vargas (in that order).

== States ==
== Areas with special status ==
=== Capital District ===
=== Federal Dependencies ===
== Municipal organization ==
Venezuelan states are subdivided into &quot;municipalities&quot; (Spanish &quot;municipios&quot;), which may correspond to either or both of county and city in English-speaking countries. &quot;Municipios&quot; are the fundamental unit of local government in Venezuela.
