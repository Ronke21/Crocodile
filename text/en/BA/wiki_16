<text>Washington Mutual, Inc. (often abbreviated to WaMu) was an American savings bank holding company based in Seattle. It was the parent company of Washington Mutual Bank, which was the largest savings and loan association in the United States until its collapse in 2008.

On September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized WaMu&#x27;s banking operations and placed it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OTS took the action due to the withdrawal of US$16.7billion in deposits during a 9-day bank run (amounting to 9% of the deposits it had held on June 30, 2008). The FDIC sold the banking subsidiaries (minus unsecured debt and equity claims) to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9billion, which had been considering acquiring WaMu as part of a plan internally nicknamed &quot;Project West&quot;. All WaMu branches were rebranded as Chase branches by the end of 2009. The holding company was left with $33billion in assets, and $8billion in debt, after being stripped of its banking subsidiary by the FDIC. The next day, it filed for Chapter 11 voluntary bankruptcy in Delaware, where it was incorporated.

Regarding total assets under management, WaMu&#x27;s closure and receivership is the largest bank failure in American financial history.
Before the receivership action, it was the sixth-largest bank in the United States.
According to WaMu&#x27;s 2007 SEC filing, the holding company held assets valued at $327.9billion (~$ in ).

On March 20, 2009, WaMu filed suit against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking damages of approximately $13billion (~$ in ) for an alleged unjustified seizure and unfair low sale price to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase promptly filed a counterclaim in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, where the WaMu bankruptcy proceedings had been continuing since the Office of Thrift Supervision&#x27;s seizure of the holding company&#x27;s bank subsidiaries.

== Business operations prior to bank receivership ==

Despite its name, WaMu ceased being a mutual company in 1983 when it demutualized and became a public company on March 11. On June 30, 2008, WaMu had total assets of $307billion (~$ in ), with 2,239 retail branch offices operating in 15 states, with 4,932 ATMs, and 43,198 employees. It held liabilities in the form of deposits of $188.3billion, and owed $82.9billion to the Federal Home Loan Bank, and had subordinated debt of $7.8billion. It held as assets of $118.9billion in single-family loans, of which $52.9billion were &quot;option adjustable rate mortgages&quot; (option ARMs), with $16billion in subprime mortgage loans, and $53.4billion of Home Equity lines of Credit (HELOCs) and credit cards receivables of $10.6billion. It was servicing for itself and other banks loans totaling $689.7billion, of which $442.7 were for other banks. It had non-performing assets of $11.6billion, including $3.23billion in payment option ARMs and $3.0billion in subprime mortgage loans.

On September 15, 2008, the holding company received a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7billion in deposits over those nine days, and in excess of $22billion in cash outflow since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.

The FDIC then sold most of the bank&#x27;s assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9billion in cash plus assumption of all secured debt and some unsecured debt. Claims of the subsidiary bank&#x27;s equity holders, senior and subordinated debt (all primarily owned by the holding company) were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase.

== History ==
=== Mutual savings bank ===
WaMu was incorporated as the Washington National Building Loan and Investment Association on September 25, 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 120 acres (49 ha) of the central business district of Seattle. The newly formed company made its first home mortgage loan on the West Coast on February 10, 1890. It changed its name to Washington Savings and Loan Association on June 25, 1908. By September 12, 1917, it was operating under the name Washington Mutual Savings Bank. The company purchased its first company, the financially distressed Continental Mutual Savings Bank, on July 25, 1930. Its marketing slogan for much of its history was &quot;The Friend of the Family&quot;.

=== Post-demutualization growth ===
In April 1982, WaMu purchased the brokerage firm Murphey Favre for undisclosed amount in cash and demutualized the following year, converting into a capital stock savings bank. Stock in the capital stock savings bank was first offered for sale on March 11, 1983. By 1989, its assets had doubled.

In November 1994, WaMu reorganized as a holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc. It separated the non-banking units from its primary banking unit, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, which was simultaneously renamed Washington Mutual Bank. The company&#x27;s stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under WAMU.

In October 2005, WaMu purchased the formerly &quot;subprime&quot; credit card issuer Providian for approximately $6.5billion, although Providian&#x27;s new management team&#x27;s strategy of targeting Prime credit card consumers had been underway since 2001, therefore the credit card unit&#x27;s nonperforming loan portfolio had improved significantly prior to the company&#x27;s sale to WaMu. In March 2006, WaMu began the move into its new headquarters, WaMu Center, located in downtown Seattle. The company&#x27;s previous headquarters, WaMu Tower, stands about a block away from the new building on Second Avenue. In August 2006, WaMu began using the official abbreviation of WaMu in all but legal situations.

==== Acquisitions ====

After the acquisition of Murphey Favre, WaMu made numerous acquisitions with the aim of expanding the corporation. By acquiring companies including PNC Mortgage, Fleet Mortgage and Homeside Lending, WaMu became the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. With the acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation in October 2005, WaMu became the nation&#x27;s 9th-largest credit-card company.

Many of WaMu&#x27;s acquisitions became reviled as the rapid post-merger integrations resulted in numerous errors. The purchase of the original PNC Mortgage came at a time when subprime lending was in a &quot;boom&quot; period, with PNC Financial Services believing that the market was too volatile. (PNC later re-entered the mortgage market in 2009 through its acquisition of National City Corp., with no plans to re-enter subprime lending.) The Dime merger resulted in account ownership to be split with account beneficiaries. The Fleet Mortgage merger resulted in entire loans simply disappearing—being serviced, but unable to be found by customer service representatives.

=== Expansion ===

==== Washington ====
In April 1983, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of three branch offices from the Tacoma-based United Mutual Savings Bank for $3.25million (~$ in ). In April 1984, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Spokane-based Lincoln Mutual Savings Bank with 14 of its 16 branch offices for $4.5million. At the time of the announcement, WaMu had 39 branch offices, mostly in western Washington.

In May 1987, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Wenatchee-based Columbia Federal Savings Bank for $40million and also the Seattle-based Shoreline Savings Bank for $7.5million. At the time of the announcement in May 1987, WaMu had 50 branch offices, all within Washington state. Both acquisitions were completed in April 1988.

In January 1990, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of all seven offices of the Seattle-based Old Stone Bank of Washington from the Rhode Islandbased Old Stone Corporation for an undisclosed amount. Old Stone originally entered the state of Washington through the acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association in 1985 with the assistance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The acquisition by WaMu was completed in June 1990 for $10million.

In June 1990, WaMu announced the completed acquisition of all six offices of the failed Walla Wallabased Frontier Federal Savings and Loan Association in Eastern Washington from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $1.8million (~$ in ).

In September 1990, WaMu announced the completed acquisition of all three Washington branches of the failed Utah-based Williamsburg Federal Savings and Loan Association from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $1.3million (~$ in ).

In November 1990, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Vancouver-based VanFed Bancorp with its Vancouver Federal Savings Bank subsidiary for $23.3million (~$ in ). At the time of the announcement in November 1990, WaMu had 75 branch offices, all within Washington state. The acquisition was completed in August 1991.

The acquisition of the Pacific Northwest branch offices from the New Yorkbased CrossLand Savings Bank that was announced in April 1991 and completed in November 1991 gave WaMu four offices within the state of Washington in addition to other offices located in the state of Oregon.

In August 1991, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Seattle-based Sound Savings and Loan Association for an undisclosed amount. At the time of the announcement in August 1991, WaMu had 84 branch offices, all within Washington state. The acquisition was completed in January 1992.

In September 1991, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Bremerton-based GNW Financial Corporation with its Great Northwest Bank subsidiary for $64million (~$ in ) in cash and stock. The acquisition was completed in April 1992.

In December 1991, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of both Washington state branch offices of the California-based World Savings and Loan Association of America, a subsidiary of Golden West Financial, for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition was completed in March 1992.

In August 1992, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Lynnwood-based Pioneer Savings Bank for $181million (~$ in ) in stock. The acquisition was completed in March 1993.
In October 1992, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation with its Pacific First Bank subsidiary for $663million (~$ in ) from its Canada-based parent Royal Trustco. The acquisition was contingent on having Pacific First dispose of its branch offices in California and having its Canadian parent Royal Trustco assume all of Pacific First&#x27;s bad loans. The acquisition was completed in April 1993. At the time of the initial announcement in October 1992, WaMu had 118 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Pacific First had 127 branch offices in Washington, Oregon and California. Pacific First had previously announced that it was trading its California offices for Great Western&#x27;s Washington offices. As a result of the Pacific First acquisition, WaMu became one of the largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits in the state of Washington, second only to Seafirst.

In June 1994, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Summit Bancorp with its Summit Savings Bank subsidiary for $25million in stock. At the time of the announcement, WaMu had 231 branch offices in Washington and Oregon. The acquisition was completed in November 1994.

In June 1995, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank for $26.8million (~$ in ) in stock, this was WaMu&#x27;s entry into the commercial banking sector. Enterprise Bank was a highly profitable one unit carriage trade business bank staffed with highly successful management. WaMu named Tom Cleveland President of the commercial banking unit which later included Western Bank in Coos Bay Oregon. At the time of the announcement, WaMu had 260 branch offices. Unlike the previous acquisition targets, Enterprise held a commercial bank charter and not a thrift charter.

==== Oregon ====
In April 1991, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the 25 offices in the Portland, Oregon / Vancouver, Washington area from the failing New Yorkbased CrossLand Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Bancorp, for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition was completed in November 1991. Seven of the 25 offices were located in Washington with the remainder in Oregon. As part of the transaction, CrossLand Savings closed seven offices in Oregon and three offices in Washington, leaving eleven offices in Oregon and four in Washington. CrossLand had previously entered Oregon (and three other states) through the relatively recent acquisition of the troubled Utah-based Western Savings and Loan Association. The CrossLand acquisition gave WaMu a toe hold entry into Oregon via Portland.

As a result of the Pacific First acquisition in April 1993, WaMu became the fourth largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits within the state of Oregon. Originally, Pacific First grew quickly in Oregon during the late 1980s through the acquisition of troubled savings and loans. By February 1991, Pacific First had 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift. Pacific First had 71 branches in Oregon by July 1992.

In April 1994, WaMu announced the completed acquisition of three Portland-area offices of the failed Portland-based Far West Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $2.2million (~$ in ).

In October 1995, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Coos Baybased Western Bank for $156million (~$ in ) in stock. The acquisition was completed in February 1996. Since Western Bank possessed a commercial bank charter and not a more restrictive savings &amp; loan charter, WaMu decided to allow Western Bank to keep its charter and name and to remain semi-autonomous for a while. At the time of the acquisition, Western Bank had 41 offices throughout Oregon. Five years later, WaMu decided to abandon the Western Bank brand and integrate most of the former Western Bank offices into the existing WaMu network in Oregon in 2001. Due to branch overlaps between the two brands, 12 Western Bank branch offices and one WaMu branch office were sold to the Klamath Falls-based Klamath First Bancorp for $33million.

==== Idaho ====
In March 1994, WaMu announced that they were planning to expand into the state of Idaho by building new branch offices inside Fred Meyer supermarket stores with the first three being opened in the Boise-area in July and August.

In the following year, WaMu opened a fourth Idaho location in a Moscow supermarket in February 1995.

A branch office in Idaho Falls was acquired from the Utah-based United Savings Bank when WaMu purchased the savings bank in January 1997.

By March 2000, there were 9 locations within Idaho and later 22 locations in 2008 when Chase acquired WaMu.

==== Utah ====
In July 1994, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake Citybased Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank, FSB, subsidiary for $52.1million in stock. At the time of the announcement, WaMu had 250 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Olympus had eight branch offices in Utah and two in Montana. The acquisition was completed in May 1995.

In March 1996, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Ogden-based Utah Federal Savings Bank for an undisclosed amount. At the time of the announcement, Utah Federal had five branch offices while WaMu had 16 within Utah. The acquisition was completed in December 1996 for $15.2million (~$ in ).

In September 1996, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake Citybased United Western Financial Group Inc. with its United Savings Bank subsidiary for $80.3million (~$ in ) in cash. At the time of the announcement, United Savings Bank had eight branch offices in Utah and one in Idaho. The acquisition was completed in January 1997.

==== Montana ====
In May 1995, WaMu acquired two branch offices in Butte as the result of the acquisition of the Utah-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank FSB subsidiary. Four years later, WaMu later sold the two offices to Glacier Bancorp in 1999 for an undisclosed amount and quietly left the state of Montana.

==== California ====

In July 1996, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Keystone Holdings Inc. with its Irvine-based American Savings Bank subsidiary for $1.6billion (~$ in ) in stock. At the time of the announcement, WaMu had 317 branch offices in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana while American Savings Bank had 220 branch offices in California. The acquisition was completed in December 1996. American kept its name after the acquisition. The result of the acquisition nearly doubled the total deposits of all WaMu subsidiaries from $22billion to $42billion.

In February 1997, the Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial, the holding company for second largest thrift in the nation Great Western Bank, found itself the target of a hostile takeover attempt of arch-rival H. F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., the holding company for the largest thrift in the nation Home Savings of America, that would have involved $5.8billion (~$ in ) worth of stock. Since the two companies had large overlapping territories, many Great Western offices would have been closed by the victor if the takeover attempt had succeeded. The only way the combat a hostile takeover was to find another company, a so-called white knight, that would allow a merger on much better terms. One such company was WaMu. In March, Great Western Financial announced that it had accepted WaMu&#x27;s merger proposal for $6.6billion in WaMu stock. Ahmanson quickly increased their bids but the bids were also rejected. Great Western approved the merger with WaMu in June and the merger was completed in July. As part of its merger agreement, it was originally announced that Great Western offices would be allowed to keep the Great Western name and there were later discussion of converting the American Savings offices to the Great Western brand. In the end, it was felt that it was best for the company to have only one brand throughout the nation instead of multiple regional brands so it was announce in December 1997 that both Great Western and American names would be retired in favor of the WaMu name. The previous month, it was announced in November that 85 redundant branch offices were identified in California and were to be closed within the following year. Before the merger was complete, WaMu had a total of 413 branch operating under various names across the country while Great Western had 416 branch offices operating in California and Florida.

In March 1998, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson &amp; Company with its Home Savings of America subsidiary for approximately $10billion in stock. The acquisition was completed in October 1998 for only $6.9billion (~$ in ) in stock. Before the merger was complete, WaMu had a total of 892 branch operating under various names (WaMu, American Savings, Great Western, etc.) across the country while Home Savings had 409 branch offices operating in California and Texas. A few days after the completion of the merger, WaMu announced plans to close 161 branch offices in California.

==== Texas ====
Through the 1998 acquisition of Home Savings, WaMu had gained 48 branch offices in Texas.

In August 2000, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Houston-based Bank United Corporation with its 155 branch offices, all located in Texas, for $1.49billion (~$ in ) in stock. The acquisition was completed in February 2001.

As a result of branch overlap between Bank United and WaMu, 17 branch offices were closed in Texas, 10 of which were in Houston.
==== New York ====
In June 2001, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the New York Citybased Dime Bancorp with its Dime Savings Bank subsidiary for $5.2billion (~$ in ) in cash and stock. The acquisition was completed in January 2002. Dime had 123 branch offices in the New York City area of both New York and New Jersey.

=== Commercial banking ===
With a thrift charter, there were a few things that WaMu was not able to do until it was able to obtain a commercial bank charter, such as making commercial loans above a certain size. To get around this problem, WaMu began to purchase commercial banks and maintain them as separate business entities. In August 1995, WaMu acquired the one office Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank in Washington. A few months later, WaMu acquired the 41 office Coos Baybased Western Bank in Oregon. By 1997, the Enterprise name and Western Bank name were merged and operated under Western Bank moniker.

After WaMu expanded into California through the acquisitions of American Savings, Great Western, and Home Savings, WaMu quietly acquired the one-office Industrial Bank in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles an undisclosed amount in 1999 and renamed it WM Business Bank.

By 2001, WaMu had 38 specialized business banking centers operating under the Western Bank name in the Northwest and the WM Business Bank name in California when they decided to exit their ill-fated venture into the commercial banking market that was then dominated with the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America.

=== Mortgage banking ===
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, WaMu decided to aggressively expand in the subprime mortgage lending field through the acquisition of existing mortgage companies at a time when other financial institutions were leaving.

In May 1999, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Orange, California-based Long Beach Financial Corporation with its Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary for $350.4million (~$ in ) in cash and stock. The acquisition was completed in October 1999. Long Beach had specialized in providing subprime mortgages. Some of Long Beach&#x27;s questionable business practices may have led to WaMu&#x27;s failure in 2008.

In January 2000, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angelesbased Alta Residential Mortgage Trust for $23million (~$ in ).

In October 2000, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based PNC Mortgage Corporation and PNC Mortgage Securities Corporation from the PNC Financial Services Group for $605million (~$ in ) in cash. The acquisition was completed in February 2001. The result of the PNC Mortgage acquisition made WaMu the nation&#x27;s third-largest lender.

In April 2001, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Columbia, South Carolinabased Fleet Mortgage Corporation from FleetBoston Financial for $660million (~$ in ) in cash. The acquisition was completed in June 2001. The result of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition made WaMu the nation&#x27;s second-largest mortgage-servicing business.

In December 2001, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Jacksonville, Florida-based HomeSide Lending, Inc. from the National Australia Bank for $1.9billion (~$ in ). The agreement did not include the mortgage servicing rights and related financial hedges for the business. The acquisition was completed in March 2002. In August 2002, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the rest of HomeSide that included the mortgage servicing rights on a mortgage portfolio worth about $131billion for $1.3billion in cash and the assumption of $735million in debt. The acquisition was completed in October 2002.

In July 2002, the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Capital Corporation announced the pending sale of the mortgage loan portfolio for its Bay View Bank subsidiary to WaMu for a &quot;slight premium to book value&quot;. The sale was completed in the following month.

In April 2006, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of the Irvine, California-based Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. with its Commercial Capital Bank FSB subsidiary for $983million (~$ in ) in cash. The acquisition was completed in October 2006. Commercial Capital had specialized in loans for the multifamily and small commercial real estate lending markets and was the third largest multifamily lender in California.

=== Credit cards ===
In June 2001, WaMu announced the pending acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation, tenth-largest credit-card issuer in the country, for $6.45billion (~$ in ) in stock and cash. The acquisition was completed in June 2001.

Prior to this acquisition, WaMu had their credit cards initially issued by Associates National Bank and later Citibank South Dakota, N.A. and was one of the largest banking organization that did not issue its own credit cards. In 2005, chairman and chief executive officer Kerry Killinger said that lack of company-issued credit cards was a &quot;major hole in our product line.&quot; Credit cards were not mentioned on their website nor in their published annual reports as an available service offered by their company prior to 2001.

=== Rise and fall ===

==== &quot;Wal-Mart of Banking&quot; ====
Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger had pledged in 2003: &quot;We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe&#x27;s, Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we&#x27;ve done our job, five years from now you&#x27;re not going to call us a bank.&quot;

Killinger&#x27;s goal was to build WaMu into the &quot;Wal-Mart of Banking&quot;, which would cater to lower- and middle-class consumers that other banks deemed too risky. Complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing, a strategy the bank extended in big cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. WaMu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers&#x27; incomes and assets. WaMu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $10,000 for bringing in borrowers. Variable-rate loans – Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs) in particular – were especially attractive, because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed WaMu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred. As WaMu was selling many of its loans to investors, it worried less about defaults.

==== Subprime losses ====
In December 2007, the subsidiary WaMu Bank reorganized its home-loan division, closing 160 of its 336 home-loan offices and removing 2,600 positions in its home-loan staff (a 22% reduction).

In March 2008, on the same weekend that JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon negotiated the takeover of Bear Stearns, he secretly dispatched members of his team to Seattle to meet with WaMu executives, urging them to consider a quick deal. However, WaMu Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger rejected JPMorgan Chase&#x27;s offer that valued WaMu at $8 a share, mostly in stock.

In April 2008, the holding company, responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis, announced that 3,000 people companywide would lose their jobs, and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining stand-alone, home-loan offices, including 23 in Washington and a loan-processing center in Bellevue, Washington. It stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as &quot;wholesale lending.&quot; WaMu also announced a $7billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by TPG Capital. TPG agreed to pump $2billion into the WaMu holding company; other investors, including some of WaMu&#x27;s current institutional holders, agreed to buy an additional $5billion in newly issued stock. This angered many investors, as TPG&#x27;s investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and as WaMu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses.

In June 2008, Kerry Killinger stepped down as the chairman, though remaining the chief executive officer. On September 8, 2008, under pressure from investors, the WaMu holding company&#x27;s board of directors dismissed Killinger as the CEO. Alan H. Fishman, chairman of mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group, and a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bank, was named the new CEO for 17 days.

==== Seizure by OTS and FDIC ====
By mid-September 2008, WaMu&#x27;s share price had closed as low as $2.00 (~$ in ). It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year. While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid. At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer ); customers pulled out $16.7billion in deposits in a ten-day span.

This led the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to step up pressure for WaMu to find a buyer, as a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could have been a severe drain on the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC had already had to use a large chunk of its insurance fund after the failure of IndyMac that year. The FDIC ultimately held a secret auction of WaMu Bank. On the morning of Thursday, September 25 (which happened to be the 119th anniversary of WaMu&#x27;s establishment), regulators informed officials at JPMorgan Chase that they had won the auction.

On Thursday night (shortly after the close of business on the West Coast), the Office of Thrift Supervision seized WaMu Bank and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC. In a statement, the OTS said that the massive run meant that WaMu was no longer sound. The FDIC then sold most of WaMu Bank&#x27;s assets, including the branch network, to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9billion. JPMorgan Chase agreed to assume the bank&#x27;s secured debts and liabilities to depositors. The transaction did not require any FDIC insurance funds. Normally, bank seizures take place after the close of business on Fridays. However, due to the bank&#x27;s deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent, regulators felt compelled to act a day early.

Because JPMorgan Chase bought WaMu&#x27;s assets for a low price, WaMu&#x27;s stockholders were nearly wiped out. Its stock price dropped to $0.16 a share, well below its high of a year earlier. In its Chapter 11 filing, WaMu listed assets of $33billion and debt of $8billion. (ref. Appendix A). The filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors.

Within days of the seizure, a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist, Mike Stathis of AVA Investment Analytics, issued a formal complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating evidence of insider trading. The complaint also alleged that WaMu was not insolvent, and several Wall Street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock. He also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press who told him that he was contacted by a WaMu executive hours before the seizure, telling the reporter that it would happen for &quot;political reasons.&quot; In later criticisms, Stathis discussed that neither the FDIC nor OTS ever disclosed any evidence of WaMu&#x27;s insolvency. Stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint, he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning. As a result of this, Stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the SEC complaint into the public domain until a year later.

Shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of WaMu through such websites as WaMuCoup.com and others, claiming that the OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price. Shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover, the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the OTS 2 weeks earlier and that the holding company&#x27;s board and management was kept completely in the dark about the government&#x27;s negotiations with Chase, hampering the bank&#x27;s ability to sell itself on its own. Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6million (which he declined) after being CEO for 17 days. Senator Maria Cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation and WaMu&#x27;s former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares.

The seizure of WaMu Bank resulted in the largest bank failure in American financial history, dwarfing the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984.

==== Bankruptcy ====
On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc. and its remaining subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company was promptly delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and commenced trading via Pink Sheets. The bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks, after the Lehman Brothers filing eleven days earlier; both bankruptcies far outpaced WorldCom&#x27;s 2002 filing, which had held the record with just under $104billion (~$ in ) in assets.

All assets but only some liabilities (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of WaMu Bank were assumed by JPMorgan Chase. Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase acquired all the banking operations of WaMu, including $307billion in assets and $188billion in deposits, for a price of $1.9billion plus debt assumptions. Unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase, leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery. On the morning of September 26, WaMu Bank customers were informed that all deposits held by WaMu were now liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.

The IRS claimed $12.5billion in back taxes from WaMu, Inc. The company filed court papers on January 22, 2009, alleging losses were $20billion (~$ in ), and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt, stating that the IRS could owe WaMu Inc. a tax refund. In a 2010 settlement between Wash. Mutual Inc. (in receivership), the FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase, a tax refund of about $5.7billion (~$ in ) will be shared between Wash. Mutual Inc., JPMorgan Chase and FDIC.

WaMu, Inc. sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for $13billion after the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan Chase. WMI attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank, and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken.

On January 11, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, District of Delaware, pursuant to Section 1102(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, appointed a Committee of Equity Security Holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock. All of the Motions to Disband the Committee of Equity Security Holders were denied on January 28, 2010, by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath, District of Delaware.

On July 20, 2010, bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved a motion of the EC for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of WMI, handing a victory to shareholders. The Judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase at the heart of WaMu&#x27;s reorganization, but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company.

On July 26, 2010, U.S. Trustee Roberta A. DeAngelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge LLP partner Joshua R. Hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC. Hochberg is a partner in McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge&#x27;s Washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense, internal investigations and compliance.

On August 10, 2010, the bankruptcy judge rejected WaMu Inc.&#x27;s effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting. Attorneys for the EC said that WMI was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information. The judge agreed that WMI was not entitled to the information.

On November 1, 2010, examiner Joshua R. Hochberg from McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge LLP presented his long-awaited report, but it did not meet the expectations of the court, since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorney-client work. On December 12, the court decided to exclude the examiner&#x27;s report during the plan confirmation hearings, saying it can&#x27;t be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions.

On January 7, 2011, the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization, which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP. Judge Mary Walrath focused many of her criticisms on the company&#x27;s releases of liability granted to directors, officers and others including some hedge funds, who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement. She noted for example that shareholders, who will likely get nothing, should not have to release the company&#x27;s board from the threat of being sued by them.

On September 14, 2011, the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization. Judge Mary F. Walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in WaMu&#x27;s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank&#x27;s debt. The four hedge funds are Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management.

A seventh plan of reorganization was announced in February 2012 and the company finally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as WMI Holdings Corporation. By 2015, WMI Holdings was able to raise $598million (~$ in ) and was looking for new acquisitions. In 2018 WMI Holdings Corporation merged with Nationstar to form Mr. Cooper Group.

=== Post receivership bank operations ===
During 2009, all of the WaMu Bank branches that had been purchased from the FDIC after the bank had been placed into receivership, were rebranded to Chase or shuttered. All financial documents issued by WaMu were changed to carry the Chase logo. Credit and debit cards issued by WaMu or Providian were changed to carry the Chase logo.

The transition to Chase began in early 2009, when Chase ATMs became accessible for WaMu customers at no extra charge. All branches and accounts were formally merged in 2009 as the WaMu brand was retired. Branches in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah were rebranded in May 2009; branches in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Greater New York were rebranded in July 2009, and the remaining branches in Nevada, California, Arizona, and Colorado were rebranded in October 2009. The last rebrandings formally retired the WaMu name.

In markets where Chase already had a dominant presence, such as Greater New York and Chicago (owing to the presence of Chase and predecessor Bank One), Chase further disposed of such branches to other banks. In New York, for instance, the acquisition resulted in Chase branches located on the same block as WaMu branches.

== Advertising campaigns ==

=== &quot;Free Checking Account&quot; ===
This advertising campaign was introduced between 2005 and 2007. Numerous WaMu commercials showed white, traditionally-dressed 60–70-year-old overweight bankers laughing out loud at a WaMu representative (who is much younger, fitter and black), who says the words &quot;Free Checking Account&quot;.

=== &quot;The Power of Yes&quot; ===
WaMu introduced an advertising campaign during the 2003 Academy Awards known as &quot;The Power of Yes&quot;. This was to promote the offering of loans to all consumers, particularly borrowers that the banks deemed too risky. Another commercial in the ad series showed WaMu representatives in casual clothes, contrasting with traditionally-dressed bankers in suits.

=== &quot;Whoo hoo&quot; ===
&quot;Whoo hoo!&quot; was an advertising campaign introduced by WaMu in February 2008. As fears of an economic crisis were rising, and WaMu was looking to become an &quot;iconic brand that people love&quot;, they began courting consumers with a new slogan, designed to position WaMu as a consumer-friendly institution.

During its run, the Whoo hoo! ads, created by TBWA\Chiat\Day of Playa del Rey, California, become widespread in web navigation. After WaMu launched the new advertisement, there was double digit growth at its website and the term &quot;wamu&quot; appeared in searches over 1,000% more between January and March than in all of 2007.

WaMu (before the bank&#x27;s September 2008 conservatorship and sale to JPMorgan Chase) applied to register a trademark in the phrase. Initially, the bank wanted to use &quot;woo hoo&quot; (without the &quot;h&quot; in the first word) as the slogan, but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by Homer Simpson, a character in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

== Occasio branch design ==
WaMu introduced a unique branch design known as Occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open, circular floor plan with a greeter or &quot;concierge&quot; position and tellers working from behind podiums. The Occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004, but was phased out following the JPMorgan Chase acquisition of WaMu&#x27;s retail banking operations.

<text>An emergent algorithm is an algorithm that exhibits emergent behavior. In essence an emergent algorithm implements a set of simple &quot;building block&quot; behaviors that when combined exhibit more complex behaviors. One example of this is the implementation of fuzzy motion controllers used to adapt robot movement in response to environmental obstacles.

An emergent algorithm has the following characteristics: 

* it achieves predictable global effects
* it does not require global visibility
* it does not assume any kind of centralized control
* it is self-stabilizing

Other examples of emergent algorithms and models include cellular automata, artificial neural networks and swarm intelligence systems (ant colony optimization, bees algorithm, etc.).

<doc id="214272" wikidata="Q999699" url="?curid=214272" title="Burned-over district">
<text>The term &quot;burned-over district&quot; refers to the western and parts of the central regions of New York State in the early 19th century, where religious revivals and the formation of new religious movements of the Second Great Awakening took place, to such a great extent that spiritual fervor expanded like a forest fire.

Charles Grandison Finney (1792–1875) popularized the term: his posthumous 1876 book &quot;Autobiography of Charles G. Finney&quot; referred to a &quot;burnt district&quot; to denote an area in central and western New York State during the Second Awakening:

I found that region of country what, in the western phrase, would be called, a &quot;burnt district.&quot; There had been, a few years previously, a wild excitement passing through that region, which they called a revival of religion, but which turned out to be spurious. ... It was reported as having been a very extravagant excitement; and resulted in a reaction so extensive and profound, as to leave the impression on many minds that religion was a mere delusion. A great many men seemed to be settled in that conviction. Taking what they had seen as a specimen of a revival of religion, they felt justified in opposing anything looking toward the promoting of a revival.

These spurious movements created feelings of apprehension towards the revivals in which Finney was influential as a preacher.

In references where the religious revival is related to reform movements of the period, such as abolition, women&#x27;s rights, utopian social experiments, anti-Masonry, Mormonism, prohibition, vegetarianism, and Seventh-Day Adventism, the &quot;burned-over&quot; region expands to include other areas of Upstate New York that were important to these movements.

Historical study of the phenomenon began with Whitney R. Cross, in 1951. Subsequent study in the last quarter of the twentieth century re-assessed the extent to which religious fervor actually affected the region. Linda K. Pritchard uses statistical data to show that, compared to the rest of New York State, to the Ohio River Valley in the lower Midwest, and to the United States as a whole, the religiosity of the burned-over district was typical rather than exceptional. More recent works have argued that these revivals in Western New York had a unique and lasting impact upon the religious and social life of the entire nation.

==Religion==
Western New York was still an American frontier during the early Erie Canal boom, and professional and established clergy were scarce. Many of the self-taught people were susceptible to enthusiasms of folk religion. Evangelists won many converts to Protestant sects, such as Congregationalists, Baptists, and Methodists. Converts in nonconformist sects became part of numerous new religious movements, all of which were founded by laypeople during the early 19th century, including:

* The Latter Day Saint movement (whose largest branch is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), originating circa 1828. Joseph Smith, Jr., lived in the area and said he was led by the angel Moroni to his source for the Book of Mormon, the Golden Plates, near Palmyra, New York.
* The Millerites, originating circa 1834. William Miller was a farmer who lived in Low Hampton, New York. He preached that the literal Second Coming would occur on October 22, 1844. Millerism became extremely popular in western New York state. Some of its concepts are still held by church organizations affiliated with Adventism, such as Seventh-day Adventists.
* The Fox sisters of Hydesville, New York, conducted the first table-rapping séances in the area around 1848, leading to the American movement of Spiritualism – centered in the retreat at Lily Dale and in the Plymouth Spiritualist Church in Rochester, New York – which taught communion with the dead.
* The Shakers were very active in the area, establishing their communal farm in central New York in 1826, and a major revival in 1837. The first Shaker settlement in America, also a communal farm, was established in 1776 just north of Albany in an area first known as Niskayuna, then Watervliet, now the town of Colonie. Shaker leader Mother Ann Lee is buried in the Shaker cemetery located in the Watervliet Shaker Historic District.
* The Oneida Society was a large utopian group that established a successful community in central New York, founded in 1848; it disbanded in 1881. It was known for its unique interpretation of group marriage under which mates were paired by committee; the children of the community were raised in common.
* The Social Gospel, founded by Washington Gladden while he was living in nearby Owego, New York, during his childhood and teens, circa 1832 to 1858. Gladden was succeeded by Walter Rauschenbusch of Rochester, New York.
* The Ebenezer Colonies, calling themselves the True Inspiration Congregations (German: ), first settled in New York near Buffalo in what is now the town of West Seneca. However, seeking more isolated surroundings, they moved to Iowa (near present-day Iowa City) in 1856, becoming the Amana Colony.

==Social and political reform==
In addition to religious activity, the region known as the burned-over district was noted for social radicalism. The Oneida Institute (1827–1843) was a center of abolitionism and the first college in the country to admit black students on the same terms as white students. The short-lived New-York Central College was the first college to accept both black students and women from its beginning and was also the first college in the country to employ African-American professors. Alfred University is the oldest surviving college in the United States to admit women to all its programs of study, rather than having female-specific programs.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the early American feminist, was a resident of Seneca Falls in central New York in the mid-1800s. She and others in the community organized the Seneca Falls Convention devoted to women&#x27;s suffrage and rights in 1848.

The larger region was the main source of converts to the Fourierist utopian socialist movement, starting around 1816. The Skaneateles Community in central New York, founded in 1843, was such an experiment. The Oneida Society was also considered a utopian group.

Related to radical reform, Upstate New York provided many Hunter Patriots, some of whom volunteered to invade Canada during the Patriot War from December 1837 to December 1838.

<text>This is a list of people known as the Great, or the equivalent, in their own language. Other languages have their own suffixes, such as Persian &quot;e Bozorg&quot; and Hindustani &quot;e Azam&quot;.

In Persia, the title &quot;the Great&quot; at first seems to have been a colloquial version of the Old Persian title &quot;Great King&quot; (King of Kings, Shahanshah). It was first used by Cyrus II of Persia. The title was inherited by Alexander III when he conquered the Persian Empire, and the epithet eventually became personally associated with him. The first reference to this is in a comedy by Plautus, in which it is assumed that everyone knew who &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; was; however, there is no evidence that he was called &quot;the Great&quot; before this. The early Seleucid kings, who succeeded Alexander in Persia, used &quot;Great King&quot; in local documents, but the title was most notably used for Antiochus the Great. Once the term gained currency, it was broadened to include persons in other fields, such as the philosopher Albert the Great.

Later rulers and commanders were given the epithet during their lifetime, for example, the Roman general Pompey. Others received the title posthumously, such as the Indian emperor Ashoka. As there are no objective criteria for &quot;greatness&quot;, the persistence of the designation varies greatly. For example, Louis XIV of France was often referred to as &quot;the Great&quot; in his lifetime, but is rarely called such nowadays, later writers preferring his more specific epithet &quot;the Sun King&quot;. German Emperor Wilhelm I was often called &quot;the Great&quot; in the time of his grandson Wilhelm II, but rarely before or after.

<text>Cottage cheese is a curdled milk product with a mild flavour and a creamy, heterogeneous, soupy texture, made from skimmed milk. An essential step in the manufacturing process distinguishing cottage cheese from other fresh cheeses is the addition of a &quot;dressing&quot; to the curd grains, usually cream, which is mainly responsible for the taste of the product. Cottage cheese is not aged.

Cottage cheese can be low in calories compared to other types of cheese — similar to yogurt; this makes it popular among dieters and some health devotees. It can be used with various foods such as yogurt, fruit, toast, and granola, in salads, as a dip, and as a replacement for mayonnaise.

==History==
===Origin===

A popular story on the origin of cheese was taken from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in which the poet describes how the Cyclops, Polyphemus, made cheese by storing milk in animal stomachs. The enzyme rennin from the stomachs of nursing animals induces a coagulation process separating the curds from the milk.

Cheese is thought to have occurred in the Middle East around 5,000 BC. Evidence of cheese can be found in a band of carvings on the walls of an ancient Mesopotamian temple that dates back to 3,000 BC. The ancient carvings show how the civilization created a cheese-like substance, using salt and milk to create a salty, sour curd mixture believed to be somewhat similar to today&#x27;s cottage cheese. As Rome expanded its empire, it spread the knowledge of cheese, discovering many new forms.

===Popularization===
In the early 20th century, farmers in northeastern British Columbia made something they called &quot;homesteader&#x27;s cheese,&quot; which is said to have been similar to modern industrial cottage cheese (a &quot;Dutch cheese&quot; also existed there at the time, but this was something else). The term &quot;cottage cheese&quot; first began to be used for such simple homemade cheese in America in the mid-19th century.

The first American cheese factory opened in 1868, beginning the wholesale cheese industry in the United States. The popularity of industrial cheese in the United States, in general, increased greatly at the end of the 19th century; by the turn of the 20th century, farm cheese production had become significant.

Cottage cheese was widely promoted in America during the First World War, along with other dairy products, to save meat for infantry rations. This promotion was shown in many war posters, including one which claimed that one pound of cottage cheese contains more protein than a pound of lamb, pork, beef, or chicken.
After the war, cottage cheese quickly became more popular. of cottage cheese were produced in 1919 (out of of cheese in general in 1920), and by 1928, were manufactured. Consumption peaked in the United States in the 1970s when dieting became popular, and some $1.3 billion of it was sold per year, but in the 1980s, yogurt became more popular, and sales dropped considerably further in the 2000s.

In 2016, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article speculated that cottage cheese might be ready for a resurgence following the popularity of Greek yogurt due to its high protein and low sugar levels.

In 2023, a TikTok trend for making ice creams, cookie dough and other foods with cottage cheese led to a 15.9% rise in sales of the product in the United States. Stores in the United Kingdom reported a 22-30% increase in sales by May 2024, compared to a year previously.

==Manufacture==
Since the 1930s, industrial cottage cheese has been manufactured using pasteurized skim milk, or in more modern processes using concentrated nonfat milk or reconstituted nonfat dry milk. A bacterial culture that produces lactic acid (&quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; ssp. &quot;lactis&quot; or &quot;L. lactis&quot; ssp. &quot;cremoris&quot; strains such as are usually used) and rennet, which allows the milk to curdle and parts to solidify, are added to skim milk and heated until it reaches , and maintained at that temperature for 8 hours or more. The solids, known as curd, form a gelatinous skin over the liquid (known as whey) in the vat, which is cut into cubes with wires, allowing more whey to drain from the curds. The curds are then reheated to for one or two hours. In Iowa in the early 1930s, hot water was poured into the vat, further forming the curds. Once the curds have been drained and are primarily dry, the mass is pressed to dry the curds further. The curds are then rinsed in water. Finally, salt and a &quot;dressing&quot; of cream are added, and the final product is packaged and shipped for consumption. Some smaller modern luxury creameries omit the first heating step but allow the milk to curdle much longer with bacteria to produce the curds or use crème fraîche as dressing.

Cottage cheese made with a food-grade acid must be labelled as a &quot;Direct Acid set.&quot;

Usually, a small amount of low -producing citrate-fermenting lactococci or leuconostoc bacterial strains are added to the starter mix for the production of diacetyl for added buttery or creamy flavours. Producers must be careful that the final product contains approximately 2 ppm diacetyl and that the ratio of diacetyl to acetaldehyde is 3–5 to 1 to achieve the typical cottage cheese flavor. If the ratio is too small, the product tastes grassy; if it is too much, the taste becomes harsh.

Titanium dioxide may be added to cottage cheese to make it a brighter white. In the United States, the FDA allows the additive in many dairy products (not whole milk) up to 1% of total volume by weight. It may also be used in Canada and the European Union. Recently, producers have added this ingredient in nanoparticle form. In the US, the FDA does not restrict nanoparticle technology used in food, but in Europe, it must be first submitted for approval as a food ingredient. According to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, it is found in hundreds of products, not always labelled as such, including many organic products; however, several large US producers have denied using it.

Cottage cheese may be marketed as a small-curd (&lt;4 mm diameter) or large-curd (&gt;8 mm diameter).
==Nutrition==
Cottage cheese is popular among dieters and some health food devotees. It is also relatively popular among bodybuilders and athletes for its high content of casein protein while being relatively low in fat. Cottage cheese is also safe to eat during pregnancy, unlike some cheese products that are not recommended.

The sour taste of the product is due to lactic acid, which is present at 124–452 mg/kg. Formic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids contribute to the aroma.

Due to its incorporation of whey, cottage cheese is high in lactose relative to most other cheeses. However, lactose is partially decomposed by lactic acid fermentation.

==Consumption==

In the United States and Canada, cottage cheese is popular in many culinary dishes. It can be combined with fruit and sugar, salt and pepper, fruit purée, tomatoes, or granola and cinnamon. It can be eaten on toast, in salads, as a chip dip, as a replacement for mayonnaise in tuna salad, and as an ingredient in recipes such as jello salad and various desserts. Cottage cheese is also popular with fruit, such as pineapple, pears, peaches, or mandarin oranges.

<text>Sherbrooke ( , ) is a city in southern Quebec, Canada. It is at the confluence of the Saint-François and Magog rivers in the heart of the Estrie administrative region. Sherbrooke is also the name of a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and census division (CD) of Quebec, coextensive with the city of Sherbrooke. With 172,950 residents at the Canada 2021 Census, it is the sixth largest city in the province and the 30th largest in Canada. The Sherbrooke Census Metropolitan Area had 227,398 inhabitants, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Quebec and 19th in Canada.

Sherbrooke is the primary economic, political, cultural, and institutional centre of Estrie, and was given its nickname as the &quot;Queen of the Eastern Townships&quot; at the beginning of the 20th century.

There are eight institutions educating 40,000 students and employing 11,000 people, 3,700 of whom are professors, teachers and researchers. The direct economic effect of these institutions exceeds one billion dollars. The proportion of university students is 10.32 students per 100 inhabitants, giving Sherbrooke the largest concentration of students in Quebec.

Sherbrooke rose as a manufacturing centre in the 1800s, and today the service sector is prominent.

The Sherbrooke region is surrounded by mountains, rivers, and lakes. There are several ski hills nearby and various tourist attractions in regional flavour. Mont-Bellevue Park, a large park in the city, is used for downhill skiing.

The city was named in 1818 for John Coape Sherbrooke, a former Governor General of Canada.

==History==

First Nations settled the region between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago. The Abenaki called it / (&#x27;the large forks&#x27;), or (where one smokes).
The first non-native settler was the farmer Jean-Baptiste Nolain, in 1779. The area was first surveyed in 1792. 
Americans from Vermont built mills in the area in 1802. Gilbert Hyatt led a group of loyalists, who settled around 1803. He dammed the Magog River and a gristmill and a sawmill were soon built nearby. The settlement was then known as Hyatt&#x27;s Mills. 

The first immigrants from England arrived in 1815. The British American Land Company was formed in 1832 to acquire and develop almost of Crown land and other lands in the area. It prioritized speculation over immigration.

In 1852 a railway linked Montreal and Portland, Maine via Sherbrooke. By the 1890s, there were rail connections to Boston, Halifax, and New York City.

Immigration from the rest of Quebec began in 1850, and by 1871 francophones were in the majority.

By the turn of the 20th century, Sherbrooke was a thriving industrial city, with manufacturing benefiting from locally-produced hydroelectricity. From the 1950s, some the steel and textile industries declined, giving way to government services and education.

As part of the 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec, the city grew considerably on 1 January 2002, when it absorbed Ascot, Bromptonville, Deauville, Fleurimont, Lennoxville, Rock Forest, and Saint-Élie-d&#x27;Orford. Part of Stoke was also annexed to the newly expanded Sherbrooke.

Sherbrooke does not host any units from the Regular Force with the exception of a recruiting centre, but four Primary Reserve units are stationed in the city:
*52nd Field Ambulance, formerly known as 8th Medical Company.
*714th Communication Squadron
*Les Fusiliers de Sherbrooke
*The Sherbrooke Hussars, formed from the amalgamation of The Sherbrooke Regiment and the 7th/11th Hussars in 1965.

A Canadian military artifact is preserved at the William Street Armoury: the Sherman tank &quot;Bomb&quot;. The tank helped liberate Europe fighting with the Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment and is the only Canadian tank to have landed on the Normandy beach on D-Day; it fought through to VE Day without being knocked out.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Transdev Limocar provides bus service to Montreal via Granby and Magog. Formerly, Autobus Jordez linked Sherbrooke to Drummondville and Trois-Rivières, and also to Victoriaville and Quebec City, but since the company lost their licence to operate heavy vehicles, they have sold their licence to Autobus La Québécoise, who now provide the service.

Société de transport de Sherbrooke (STS) provides bus service within the city. It operates 18 bus routes, 10 minibus routes, 7 express routes, 3 taxibus routes, and 3 microbus routes.

The city is located at the eastern terminus of A-10, and directly on the Autoroute Trans-Québécoise (A-55). A-10 provides a direct freeway connection to Montreal and points west, while A-55 connects directly to Trois-Rivières, Shawinigan, and points north, as well as to Interstate 91 to the south (Vermont). A-410 and A-610 are the southern and northern bypass roads, respectively.

The last passenger train for the city was VIA Rail&#x27;s Montreal – Saint John, New Brunswick &quot;Atlantic&quot;, which ended service in 1994. There have been recent proposals to provide rail service from Montreal to Boston with a stop in Sherbrooke.

Sherbrooke Airport, in Cookshire-Eaton is just east of the city. There are currently no scheduled flights operating out of the airport.

===Public health===
The suburban Sherbrooke University Hospital (&quot;CHUS&quot; or &quot;Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbooke) has over 5,200 employees, including 550 doctors. It includes a clinical research facility, the Étienne-Lebel Research Centre.

==Education==
Education represents an important part of Sherbrooke, both as part of the city&#x27;s character and as a principal domain of employment, employing about 11,000 people in its colleges and universities. The city has approximately 40,000 postsecondary students, of which about 17,000 are university students.

===Postsecondary===

Sherbrooke has five academic institutions that make up the Sherbrooke University Pole, providing both English and French education. Students in university comprise a total 10.32% of the city&#x27;s population, the highest concentration in the province.

The city is the location of one French-language university, the Université de Sherbrooke, which alone has more than 31,000 students annually. The programs are split among 8 different faculties, the largest of which being in education, medicine, and management with around 7,900, 5,000 and 4,800 students per year respectively. 3,000 of the university&#x27;s students are international students, coming from around 100 different countries and territories. About half of the foreign students come from France, as they are exempt from additional tuition fees as part of a student mobility agreement between the Québec and French governments. The university is split into three different campuses: the main campus, the Health campus located in upper Fleurimont, and the campus in Longueuil.

One of the province&#x27;s three English-language universities, Bishop&#x27;s University, is also located in Sherbrooke; more specifically, it is in the borough of Lennoxville. The school brings in around 3,000 students annually, mainly for undergraduate programs. It is subdivided into three faculties and schools, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the School of Education, and the Williams School of Business.

There are three cégeps in Sherbrooke. Two of them French-language, the Cégep de Sherbrooke and the Séminaire de Sherbrooke), and one is English-language (Champlain College Lennoxville).

===Primary and secondary education===
The city&#x27;s public primary and secondary schools are run by either the French-language Centre de services scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke or the English-language Eastern Townships School Board. The CSSRS educates around 25,000 students and employs 4,000 teachers, support staff, and administrative staff.

<doc id="214287" wikidata="Q622563" url="?curid=214287" title="Curd">
<text>Curd is obtained by coagulating milk in a sequential process called curdling. It can be a final dairy product or the first stage in cheesemaking. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet, a culture, or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or &quot;curds&quot;. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. 

Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow&#x27;s milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. Curds can be used in baking or may be consumed as a snack.
==Uses==
In England, curds produced using rennet are referred to as junket, having a texture similar to pudding or jelly. Junket is a pudding-like dessert decorated with ingredients such as semolina, raisins, chopped nuts and other ingredients. This can be baked, or the curd pudding can be used to bake thin custard pancakes.

Cheese curds, drained of the whey and served without further processing or aging, are popular in some French-speaking regions of Canada, such as Quebec, parts of Ontario, and Atlantic Canada. These are often sold in snack-sized packaging and seen as a typically Canadian food item. Throughout Canada cheese curds are served with french fries and gravy in a popular snack called &quot;poutine&quot;. 

Curds are also typical of some Germanic-descent regions such as historic Waterloo County in Ontario.

In some parts of the Midwestern U.S., especially in Wisconsin, curds are eaten fresh without further additions, or they are breaded and fried.

Curd products vary by region and include cottage cheese, curd cheese (both curdled by bacteria and sometimes also rennet), farmer cheese, pot cheese, &quot;queso blanco&quot;, and paneer. The word can also refer to a non-dairy substance of similar appearance or consistency, though in these cases a modifier or the word &#x27;curdled&#x27; is generally used.

Hungary has a form of curds called &quot;túró&quot;, which is an ingredient in several national dishes, such as &quot;túrós palacsinta&quot;, &quot;túrós csusza&quot; and &quot;túrógombóc&quot;. In 2019, &quot;rögös túró&quot; — a form that has a unique texture &quot;consisting of clumps of loose lumps reminiscent of cauliflower&quot; (the name translates to &quot;lumpy túró&quot;) — was granted the status of Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) by the EU.

In Turkey, curds are called &quot;keş&quot; and are served on fried bread and are also eaten with macaroni in the provinces of Bolu and Zonguldak.

In Sri Lanka, curd is eaten fresh as a dessert since antiquity. Usually buffalo curd cured in clay pots and served with kitul treacle (Caryota urens), is considered a delicacy in almost every part of the island. Although cows milk curd also is produced, Buffalo curd is the preferred variety.

In Nepal, curd is produced by souring pasteurized milk with natural micro-flora. The pasteurized milk is added to a container called &quot;theki&quot; carved out of wood like Daar(Boehmeria Rugulosa). The milk is left for 12–16 hours and the micro-organisms entrapped within the Theki act as inocula. The curd produced after is used to make &quot;chhurpi&quot; and variations of it.

In Mexico, &quot;chongos zamoranos&quot; is a dessert prepared with milk curdled with sugar and cinnamon.

Albanian is made by boiling whey for about 15 minutes and adding vinegar or lemon. The derivative is drained and salted to taste. can be served immediately or refrigerated for a couple of days.

<text>The American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) is a large aquatic soaring bird from the order Pelecaniformes. It breeds in interior North America, moving south and to the coasts, as far as Costa Rica, in winter.

==Taxonomy==
The American white pelican was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other pelicans in the genus &quot;Pelecanus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Pelecanus erythrorhynchos&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;rough-billed pelican&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham. Latham had access to three specimens that had been brought to London from New York and the Hudson Bay area of North America. The scientific name means &quot;red-billed pelican&quot;, from the Latin term for a pelican, &quot;Pelecanus&quot;, and &quot;erythrorhynchos&quot;, derived from the Ancient Greek words (, &quot;red&quot;) + (, &quot;bill&quot;). The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==


The American white pelican rivals the trumpeter swan, with a similar overall length, as one of the longest birds native to North America. Both very large and plump, it has an overall length of about , courtesy of the huge beak which measures in males and in females. It has a wingspan of about . The species also has the second-largest average wingspan of any North American bird, after the California condor. This large wingspan allows the bird to easily use soaring flight for migration. Body weight can range between , although typically these birds average between . One mean body mass of was reported. Another study found mean weights to be somewhat lower than expected, with eleven males averaging and six females averaging . Among standard measurements, the wing chord measures and the tarsus measures long. The plumage is almost entirely bright white, except for the black primary and secondary remiges, which are hardly visible except in flight. From early spring until after breeding has finished in mid-late summer, the breast feathers have a yellowish hue. After moulting into the eclipse plumage, the upper head often has a grey hue, as blackish feathers grow between the small wispy white crest.

The bill is huge and flat on the top, with a large throat sac below, and, in the breeding season, is vivid orange in color as is the bare skin around the eye and the feet. Iris coloration depends upon age and season, ranging from bright white to hazel to blue-gray. In the breeding season, both sexes grow a laterally flattened keratinous &quot;horn&quot; on the upper bill, located about one-third the bill&#x27;s length behind the tip. This is the only one of the eight species of pelican to have a bill &quot;horn&quot;. The horn is shed after the birds have mated and laid their eggs. Outside the breeding season, the bare parts become duller in color, with the naked facial skin yellow and the bill, pouch, and feet a dull pink-orange.

Apart from the difference in size, males and females look exactly alike. Immature birds have light grey plumage with darker brownish nape and remiges. Their bare parts are dull grey. Chicks are naked at first, then grow white down feathers all over, before moulting to the immature plumage.

==Distribution and ecology==

American white pelicans nest in colonies of several hundred pairs on islands in remote brackish and freshwater lakes of inland North America. The most northerly nesting colony can be found on islands in the rapids of the Slave River between Fort Fitzgerald, Alberta, and Fort Smith, Northwest Territories. Several groups have been visiting the bird sanctuary at Useless Bay in the state of Washington since 2015. About 10–20% of the population uses Gunnison Island in the Great Basin&#x27;s Great Salt Lake as a nesting ground. The southernmost colonies are in southeastern Ontario and western Nevada.

They winter on the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts from central California and Florida south to Costa Rica, and along the Mississippi River at least as far north as St. Paul, Minnesota. In winter quarters, they are rarely found on the open seashore, preferring estuaries, bays, and lakes. They cross deserts and mountains but avoid the open ocean on migration. But stray birds, often blown off course by hurricanes, have been seen in the Caribbean. In Colombian territory, it was recorded first on February 22, 1997, on the San Andrés Island, where they might have been swept by Hurricane Marco which passed nearby in November 1996. Since then, there have also been a few observations likely to pertain to this species on the Colombian mainland, e.g. at Calamar.

Wild American white pelicans may live for more than 16 years. In captivity, the record lifespan stands at over 34 years.

===Food and feeding===

Unlike the brown pelican (&quot;P. occidentalis&quot;), the American white pelican does not dive for its food. Instead, it catches its prey while swimming. Each bird eats more than of food a day. The fish taken by pelicans can range from the size of minnows to 3.5-pound pickerels. Typical fish prey include Cypriniformes like common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;), Lahontan tui chub (&quot;Gila bicolor obesa&quot;), minnows, and shiners. Perciformes like Sacramento perch (&quot;Archoplites interruptus&quot;) or yellow perch (&quot;Perca flavescens&quot;), Salmoniformes like rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) and salmon, Siluriformes (catfish), and jackfish. Other animals eaten by these birds are crayfish, amphibians, and sometimes larval salamanders. Birds nesting on saline lakes, where food is scarce, will travel great distances to better feeding grounds.

American white pelicans like to come together in groups of a dozen or more birds to feed, as they can thus cooperate and corral fish to one another. When this is not easily possible – for example in deep water, where fish can escape by diving out of reach – they prefer to forage alone. But the birds also steal food on occasion from other birds, a practice known as kleptoparasitism. White pelicans are known to steal fish from other pelicans, gulls, and cormorants from the surface of the water and, in one case, from a great blue heron while both large birds were in flight.

===Reproduction===
As noted above, they are colonial breeders, with up to 10,000 pairs per site. The birds arrive on the breeding grounds in March or April; nesting starts between early April and early June. During the breeding season, both males and females develop a pronounced bump on the top of their large beaks. This conspicuous growth is shed by the end of the breeding season.

The nest is a shallow depression scraped in the ground, into which some twigs, sticks, reeds, or similar debris have been gathered. After about one week of courtship and nest-building, the female lays a clutch of usually two or three eggs, sometimes just one, sometimes up to six.

Both parents incubate for about one month. The young leave the nest 3–4 weeks after hatching; at this point, usually only one young per nest has survived. They spend the following month in a creche or &quot;pod&quot;, moulting into immature plumage and eventually learning to fly. After fledging, the parents care for their offspring some three more weeks, until the close family bond separates in late summer or early fall, and the birds gather in larger groups on rich feeding grounds in preparation for the migration to the winter quarters. They migrate south by September or October.

===Predation===
Occasionally, these pelicans may nest in colonies on isolated islands, which is believed to significantly reduce the likelihood of mammalian predation. Red foxes and coyotes prey upon colonies that they can access, and several gulls have been known to prey on pelican eggs and nestlings (including herring, ring-billed, and California gull), as well as common ravens. Young pelicans may be hunted by great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles, and golden eagles. The pelicans react to mammalian threats differently from avian threats. Though fairly approachable while feeding, the pelicans may temporarily abandon their nests if a human closely approaches the colony. If the threat is another bird, however, the pelicans do not abandon the nest and may fight off the interloper by jabbing at them with their considerable bills. Full-grown pelicans have few predators. Only red foxes and coyotes are known to prey on nesting adults on rare occasions.

===Status and conservation===
This species is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. It has the California Department of Fish and Game protective status California species of special concern (CSC). On a global scale, however, the species is common enough to qualify as a Species of Least Concern according to the IUCN.

Habitat loss is the largest known cause of nesting failure, with flooding and drought being recurrent problems. Human-related losses include entanglement in fishing gear, boating disturbance, and poaching as well as additional habitat degradation.

There was a pronounced decline in American white pelican numbers in the mid-20th century, attributable to the excessive spraying of DDT, endrin, and other organochlorides in agriculture as well as widespread draining and pollution of wetlands. But populations have recovered well after stricter environmental protection laws came into effect, and are stable or slightly increasing today. By the 1980s, more than 100,000 adult American white pelicans were estimated to exist in the wild, with 33,000 nests altogether in the 50 colonies in Canada, and 18,500 nests in the 14–17 United States colonies. Shoreline erosion at breeding colonies remains a problem in some cases, as are the occasional mass poisonings when pesticides are used near breeding or wintering sites.

<text>Hepatitis D is a type of viral hepatitis caused by the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). HDV is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. HDV is considered to be a satellite (a type of subviral agent) because it can propagate only in the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Transmission of HDV can occur either via simultaneous infection with HBV (coinfection) or superimposed on chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis B carrier state (superinfection).

HDV infecting a person with chronic hepatitis B (superinfection) is considered the most serious type of viral hepatitis due to its severity of complications. These complications include a greater likelihood of experiencing liver failure in acute infections and a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, with an increased risk of developing liver cancer in chronic infections. In combination with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis D has the highest fatality rate of all the hepatitis infections, at 20%. A recent estimate from 2020 suggests that currently 48 million people are infected with this virus.
==Virology==
===Structure and genome===
The hepatitis delta viruses, or HDV, are eight species of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (or virus-like particles) classified together as the genus &quot;Deltavirus&quot;, within the realm &quot;Ribozyviria&quot;. The HDV virion is a small, spherical, enveloped particle with a 36 nm diameter; its viral envelope contains host phospholipids, as well as three proteins taken from the hepatitis B virus—the large, medium, and small hepatitis B surface antigens. This assembly surrounds an inner ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle, which contains the genome surrounded by about 200 molecules of hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) for each genome. The central region of HDAg has been shown to bind RNA. Several interactions are also mediated by a coiled-coil region at the N terminus of HDAg.

The HDV genome is negative sense, single-stranded, closed circular RNA; with a genome of approximately 1700 nucleotides, HDV is the smallest &quot;virus&quot; known to infect animals. It has been proposed that HDV may have originated from a class of plant pathogens called viroids, which are much smaller than viruses. Its genome is unique among animal viruses because of its high GC nucleotide content. Its nucleotide sequence is about 70% self-complementary, allowing the genome to form a partially double-stranded, rod-like RNA structure. HDV strains are highly divergent; fusions of different strains exist and sequences had been deposited in public databases employing different start sites for the circular viral RNA involved. This had resulted in something of chaos with respect to molecular classification of this virus, a situation which has been resolved recently with the adoption of a proposed reference genome and a uniform classification system.

===Life cycle===
Like hepatitis B, HDV gains entry into liver cells via the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) bile transporter. HDV recognizes its receptor via the N-terminal domain of the large hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg. Mapping by mutagenesis of this domain has shown that amino acid residues 9–15 make up the receptor-binding site. After entering the hepatocyte, the virus is uncoated and the nucleocapsid translocated to the nucleus due to a signal in HDAg. Since the HDV genome does not code for an RNA polymerase to replicate the virus&#x27; genome, the virus makes use of the host cellular RNA polymerases. Initially thought to use just RNA polymerase II, now RNA polymerases I and III have also been shown to be involved in HDV replication.
Normally RNA polymerase II utilizes DNA as a template and produces mRNA. Consequently, if HDV indeed utilizes RNA polymerase II during replication, it would be the only known animal pathogen capable of using a DNA-dependent polymerase as an RNA-dependent polymerase.

The RNA polymerases treat the RNA genome as double-stranded DNA due to the folded rod-like structure it is in. Three forms of RNA are made; circular genomic RNA, circular complementary antigenomic RNA, and a linear polyadenylated antigenomic RNA, which is the mRNA containing the open reading frame for the HDAg. Synthesis of antigenomic RNA occurs in the nucleolus, mediated by RNA polymerase I, whereas synthesis of genomic RNA takes place in the nucleoplasm, mediated by RNA polymerase II. HDV RNA is synthesized first as linear RNA that contains many copies of the genome. The genomic and antigenomic RNA contain a sequence of 85 nucleotides, the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, that acts as a ribozyme, which self-cleaves the linear RNA into monomers. These monomers are then ligated to form circular RNA.

===Delta antigens===

A significant difference between viroids and HDV is that, while viroids produce no proteins, HDV is known to produce one protein, namely HDAg. It comes in two forms; a 27kDa large-HDAg, and a small-HDAg of 24kDa. The N-terminals of the two forms are identical, they differ by 19 more amino acids in the C-terminal of the large HDAg. Both isoforms are produced from the same reading frame which contains an UAG stop codon at codon 196, which normally produces only the small-HDAg. However, editing by cellular enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) changes the stop codon to UGG, allowing the large-HDAg to be produced. Despite having 90% identical sequences, these two proteins play diverging roles during the course of an infection. HDAg-S is produced in the early stages of an infection and enters the nucleus and supports viral replication. HDAg-L, in contrast, is produced during the later stages of an infection, acts as an inhibitor of viral replication, and is required for assembly of viral particles. Thus RNA editing by the cellular enzymes is critical to the virus&#x27; life cycle because it regulates the balance between viral replication and virion assembly.

===Antigenic loop infectivity===
The HDV envelope protein has three of the HBV surface proteins anchored to it. The S region of the genome is most commonly expressed and its main function is to assemble subviral particles. HDV antigen proteins combine with the viral genome to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) which when enveloped with the subviral particles can form viral-like particles that are almost identical to mature HDV, but they are not infectious. Researchers had concluded that the determinant of infectivity of HDV was within the N-terminal pre-S1 domain of the large protein (L). It was found to be a mediator in binding to the cellular receptor. Researchers Georges Abou Jaoudé and Camille Sureau published an article in 2005 that studied the role of the antigenic loop, found in HDV envelope proteins, in the infectivity of the virus. The antigenic loop, like the N-terminal pre-S1 domain of the large protein, is exposed at the virion surface. Jaoudé and Sureau&#x27;s study provided evidence that the antigenic loop may be an important factor in HDV entry into the host cell and by mutating parts of the antigenic loop, the infectivity of HDV may be minimized.

==Transmission==
The routes of transmission of hepatitis D are similar to those for hepatitis B. Infection is largely restricted to persons at high risk of hepatitis B infection, particularly injecting drug users and persons receiving clotting factor concentrates. Worldwide more than 15 million people are co-infected. HDV is rare in most developed countries, and is mostly associated with intravenous drug use. However, HDV is much more common in the immediate Mediterranean region, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and the northern part of South America. In all, about 20 million people may be infected with HDV.

== People at risk ==
As previously stated, patients previously diagnosed with hepatitis B are at risk for hepatitis D infection. Hepatitis D infection risk increases if a person uses injecting drugs, is a hemophiliac, if they are a hemodialysis patient, or through sexual contact with other infected persons.

==Prevention==
Vaccination against hepatitis B protects against hepatitis D viral infection as hepatitis D requires hepatitis B viral infection to be present in order to infect and replicate in people. Universal vaccination against hepatitis B virus is recommended by the World Health Organization. The hepatitis B vaccine is routinely given soon after birth (usually within 24 hours) to protect against hepatitis B and D viral infection.

Latex or polyurethane condoms have been shown to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B, and most likely hepatitis D viral infection.

Women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should undergo testing for HBV to know if they carry the virus, this will allow prevention strategies to be implemented during the birth of the child. The CDC recommends that all women who are pregnant be tested for hepatitis B viral infection and that all infants of women with HBV infection be given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth to prevent transmission of the virus from mother to child.

Those who get tattoos or body piercings should do so using sterile equipment to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B and D via infected bodily fluids. Hepatitis B and D can also be transmitted from contaminated needles, so those who inject drugs should seek help to stop drug use or use sterile needles and avoid sharing needles with others. Those with hepatitis B or D should also not share razors or other personal care items which may have been contaminated by potentially infectious bodily fluids.

==Diagnosis==
Screening for hepatits D requires testing for anti-HDV antibodies, which indicate past exposure to the virus or current infection. If anti-HDV antibodies are present, then active HDV infection is confirmed by measuring hepatitis D RNA levels. Testing for HDV is only indicated in those who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive (those who have had previous or active infection with hepatitis B) as HDV requires hepatitis B viral infection to infect people. Non-invasive measures of liver fibrosis, such as the biomarker based FibroTest or non-invasive liver imaging such as transient elastography (also known as the FibroScan) have not been validated as quantitative measures of liver fibrosis in those with chronic hepatitis D infection. In those with whom liver fibrosis or cirrhosis is suspected, a liver biopsy is usually needed.

==Treatment==
Current established treatments for chronic hepatitis D include conventional or pegylated interferon alpha therapy. Evidence suggests that pegylated interferon alpha is effective in reducing the viral load and the effect of the disease during the time the drug is given, but the benefit generally stops if the drug is discontinued. The efficiency of this treatment does not usually exceed about 20%, and late relapse after therapy has been reported.

In May 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency approved the antiviral Hepcludex (bulevirtide) to treat hepatitis D. Bulevirtide binds and inactivates the sodium/bile acid cotransporter, blocking hepatitis D virus (as well as hepatitis B virus) from entering hepatocytes. Bulevirtide may be given with pegylated interferon alpha as the two are thought to have a synergistic effect, leading to greater treatment response rates.

In patients with HDV-related compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension, the treatment with (bulevirtide) was safe, well tolerated and has led to a significant improvement in biochemical variables and an increase in liver function parameters.

Other treatments for hepatitis D which are currently under development include pegylated interferon lambda (λ), which binds to receptors on the hepatocyte surface leading to an intracellular signaling cascade via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and activation of anti-viral cell mediated immunity. The prenylation inhibitor lonafarnib prevents hepatitis D viral particle assembly by inhibiting the farnesylation of the L-HDAg. REP2139-Ca is a nucleic acid polymer that prevents the release of hepatitis B surface antigen (which is required for assembly of hepatitis D viral particles).

== Prognosis ==
Superinfections, in which hepatitis D viral infection occurs in someone who has chronic hepatitis B (as opposed to co-infection, in which a person is infected with hepatitis B and D simultaneously), are more likely to progress to chronic hepatitis D and are associated with a worse prognosis. 90% of cases of chronic hepatitis D infection are thought to be due to superinfection in those already with hepatitis B. Hepatitis B and D co-infection is likely to lead to acute hepatitis, but is usually self limited with regards to the hepatitis D infection. Chronic hepatitis B and D is associated with a worse prognosis than chronic hepatitis B alone. Infection with both viruses is characterized by a poor prognosis with 75% of those with chronic hepatitis D developing liver cirrhosis within 15 years and a much higher risk of developing liver cancer. Persistent HDV viremia is the most important risk factor for disease progression in those with co-infection or superinfection. Other factors that are responsible for a poor prognosis in chronic hepatitis D include male sex, older age at time of infection, alcohol use, diabetes, obesity and immunodeficiency.

== Epidemiology ==
HDV is prevalent worldwide. However, the prevalence is decreasing in many higher income countries due to hepatitis B vaccination programs (although rates remain high in some groups such as those who inject drugs or immigrants from HDV endemic regions). Infection with HDV is a major medical scourge in low income regions of the globe in which HBV prevalence remains high. Currently the Amazon basin and low income regions of Asia and Africa have high rates of HDV, owing to concurrently high rates of HBV. Globally, five percent of those with chronic hepatitis B infection also have hepatitis D and 12.5% of people with HIV are also co-infected with hepatitis D.

==History==
Hepatitis D virus was first reported in 1977 as a nuclear antigen in patients infected with HBV who had severe liver disease. This nuclear antigen was then thought to be a hepatitis B antigen and was called the delta antigen. Subsequent experiments in chimpanzees showed that the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) was a structural part of a pathogen that required HBV infection to produce a complete viral particle. The entire genome was cloned and sequenced in 1986. It was subsequently placed in its own genus: &quot;Deltavirus&quot;.

===Lábrea fever===

Lábrea fever is a lethal tropical infection discovered in the 1950s in the city of Lábrea, in the Brazilian Amazon basin, where it occurs mostly in the area south of the Amazon River, in the states of Acre, Amazonas, and Rondônia. The disease has also been diagnosed in Colombia and Peru. It is now known to be a coinfection or superinfection of hepatitis B (HBV) with hepatitis D.

Lábrea fever has a sudden onset, with jaundice, anorexia (lack of appetite), hematemesis (vomiting of blood), headache, fever and severe prostration. Death occurs by acute liver failure (ALF). In the last phase, neurological symptoms such as agitation, delirium, convulsions and hemorrhagic coma commonly appear. These symptoms arise from a fulminant hepatitis which may kill in less than a week, and which characteristically affects children and young adults, and more males than females. It is accompanied also by an encephalitis in many cases. The disease is highly lethal: in a study carried out in 1986 at Boca do Acre, also in the Amazon, 39 patients out of 44 died in the acute phase of the disease. Survivors may develop chronic disease.

The main discovery of delta virus and HBV association was done by Gilberta Bensabath, of the Instituto Evandro Chagas, of Belém, state of Pará, and her collaborators.

Infected patients show extensive destruction of liver tissue, with steatosis of a particular type (microsteatosis, characterized by small fat droplets inside the cells), and infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells called &quot;morula cells&quot;, comprised mainly by macrophages containing delta virus antigens.

In the 1987 Boca do Acre study, scientists did an epidemiological survey and reported delta virus infection in 24% of asymptomatic HBV carriers, 29% of acute nonfulminant hepatitis B cases, 74% of fulminant hepatitis B cases, and 100% of chronic hepatitis B cases. The delta virus seems to be endemic in the Amazon region.

==Evolution==
Three genotypes (I–III) were originally described. Genotype I has been isolated in Europe, North America, Africa and some Asia. Genotype II has been found in Japan, Taiwan, and Yakutia (Russia). Genotype III has been found exclusively in South America (Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela). Some genomes from Taiwan and the Okinawa islands have been difficult to type but have been placed in genotype 2. However it is now known that there are at least 8 genotypes of this virus (HDV-1 to HDV-8). Phylogenetic studies suggest an African origin for this pathogen.

An analysis of 36 strains of genotype 3 estimated that the most recent common ancestor of these strains originated around 1930. This genotype spread exponentially from early 1950s to the 1970s in South America. The substitution rate was estimated to be 1.07 substitutions per site per year. Another study found an overall evolution rate of 3.18 substitutions per site per year. The mutation rate varied with position : the hypervariable region evolved faster (4.55 substitutions per site per year) than the hepatitis delta antigen coding region (2.60 substitutions per site per year) and the autocatalytic region (1.11 substitutions per site per year). A third study suggested a mutation rate between 9.5 to 1.2 substitutions/site/year.

Genotypes, with the exception of type 1, appear to be restricted to certain geographical areas: HDV-2 (previously HDV-IIa) is found in Japan, Taiwan and Yakutia; HDV-4 (previously HDV-IIb) in Japan and Taiwan; HDV-3 in the Amazonian region; HDV-5, HDV-6, HDV-7 and HDV-8 in Africa. Genotype 8 has also been isolated from South America. This genotype is usually only found in Africa and may have been imported into South America during the slave trade.

HDV-specific CD8+ T cells can control the virus, but it has been found HDV mutates to escape detection by CD8+ T cells.

==Related species==
A few other viruses with similarity to HDV have been described in species other than humans. Unlike HDV, none of them depend on a &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot; (HBV family) virus to replicate. These agents have rod-like structure, a delta antigen, and a ribozyme. HDV and all such relatives are classified in their own realm, &quot;Ribozyviria&quot;, by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

<text>The brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) is a bird of the pelican family, Pelecanidae, one of three species found in the Americas and one of two that feed by diving into water. It is found on the Atlantic Coast from New Jersey to the mouth of the Amazon River, and along the Pacific Coast from British Columbia to Peru, including the Galapagos Islands. The nominate subspecies in its breeding plumage has a white head with a yellowish wash on the crown. The nape and neck are dark maroon–brown. The upper sides of the neck have white lines along the base of the gular pouch, and the lower fore neck has a pale yellowish patch. The male and female are similar, but the female is slightly smaller. The nonbreeding adult has a white head and neck. The pink skin around the eyes becomes dull and gray in the nonbreeding season. It lacks any red hue, and the pouch is strongly olivaceous ochre-tinged and the legs are olivaceous gray to blackish-gray.

The brown pelican mainly feeds on fish, but occasionally eats amphibians, crustaceans, and the eggs and nestlings of birds. It nests in colonies in secluded areas, often on islands, vegetated land among sand dunes, thickets of shrubs and trees, and mangroves. Females lay two or three oval, chalky white eggs. Incubation takes 28 to 30 days with both sexes sharing duties. The newly hatched chicks are pink, turning gray or black within 4 to 14 days. About 63 days are needed for chicks to fledge. Six to 9 weeks after hatching, the juveniles leave the nest, and gather into small groups known as pods.

The brown pelican is the national bird of Saint Martin, Barbados, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the official state bird of Louisiana, appearing on the flag, seal, or coat of arms of each. It has been rated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It was listed under the United States Endangered Species Act from 1970 to 2009, as pesticides such as dieldrin and DDT threatened its future in the Southeastern United States and California. In 1972, the use of DDT was banned in Florida, followed by the rest of the United States. Since then, the brown pelican&#x27;s population has increased. In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt set aside the first National Wildlife Refuge, Florida&#x27;s Pelican Island, to protect the species from hunters.

== Taxonomy ==
The brown pelican was described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 1766 12th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name of &quot;Pelecanus occidentalis.&quot; It belongs to the New World clade of the genus &quot;Pelecanus&quot;.

Five subspecies of the brown pelican are recognized. At least some of these subspecies are genetically distinct despite similar phenotypes. The subspecies differ from one another in size, coloration of the throat pouch (among other bare parts) in breeding condition, and/or certain breeding plumage details, as well as geographic range. 
The brown pelican is part of a clade that includes the Peruvian pelican (&quot;P. thagus&quot;) and American white pelican (&quot;P. erythrorhynchos&quot;); brown and Peruvian pelicans are sister taxa, with American white pelican a more distant relative. The Peruvian pelican was previously considered a subspecies of the brown pelican, but is now considered a separate species on the basis of its much greater size (around double the weight of the brown pelican), differences in bill color and plumage, and a lack of evidence of hybridization between the forms where their ranges approach and overlap. (In captivity, the brown pelican is known to have hybridized with both the American white pelican and the more distantly related great white pelican.)

In 1932, James L. Peters divided &quot;Pelecanus&quot; into three subgenera, placing brown pelican (including Peruvian pelican) in a monospecific &quot;Leptopelicanus&quot;, American white pelican in a monospecific &quot;Cyrtopelicanus&quot;, and all the rest in the subgenus &quot;Pelecanus&quot;, a treatment which was also followed by Jean Dorst and Raoul J. Mougin in 1979. Andrew Elliott in 1992, and Joseph B. Nelson in 2005, considered the deepest division among pelicans to lie between brown (plus Peruvian) pelican on the one hand, and the white-plumaged pelicans on the other (among which the large ground-nesting American white, Australian, great white, and Dalmatian pelicans were thought to form a clade, and the smaller tree-nesting pink-backed and spot-billed pelicans were likewise considered sister taxa). In 1993, Paul Johnsgard hypothesized that the Americas were colonized relatively late in pelican evolution, with the family originating in Africa or South Asia; however, he later supported the prevailing view that brown (with Peruvian) was the most divergent pelican (and considered American white and great white pelicans to be close relatives, implying two independent dispersals of pelicans into the Americas, with that of the ancestor of brown and Peruvian pelicans occurring early on). Sibley and Ahlquist&#x27;s DNA-DNA hybridization studies and UPGMA tree published in 1990 supported brown pelican as sister to a clade comprising all the white-plumaged pelicans analyzed, including American white pelican (although the relationships among the latter group differed).

With better genetic data and more modern methods, a new phylogenetic hypothesis of pelican relationships has arisen, which contrasts with the traditional view of brown and Peruvian being the most divergent pelicans based on their distinctive plumage and behavior (and early molecular data). Rather than the brown-plumaged pelicans and white-plumaged pelicans forming two reciprocally monophyletic groups, the American white pelican is sister to brown and Peruvian pelicans, the three together forming an exclusively New World pelican clade. (Among the other pelicans, pink-backed, Dalmatian, and spot-billed pelicans are close relatives, together sister to Australian pelican. Great white pelican has no particularly close relatives; while it may be sister to the previous four, this relationship had low statistical support.)

==Description==

The brown pelican is the smallest of the eight extant pelican species, but is often one of the larger seabirds in their range nonetheless. It measures in length and has a wingspan of . The weight of adults can range from , about half the weight of the other pelicans found in the Americas, the Peruvian and American white pelicans. The average weight in Florida of 47 females was , while that of 56 males was . Like all pelicans, it has a very long bill, measuring in length.

The nominate subspecies in its breeding plumage has a white head with a yellowish wash on the crown. The nape and neck are dark maroon–brown. The upper sides of the neck have white lines along the base of the gular pouch, and the lower foreneck has a pale yellowish patch. The feathers at the center of the nape are elongated, forming short, deep chestnut crest feathers. It has a silvery gray &lt;dfn&gt;mantle,&lt;/dfn&gt; &lt;dfn&gt;scapulars&lt;/dfn&gt;, and upperwing coverts (feathers on the upper side of the wings), with a brownish tinge. The lesser coverts have dark bases, which gives the leading edge of the wing a streaky appearance. The uppertail coverts (feathers above the tail) are silvery white at the center, forming pale streaks. The median (between the greater and the lesser coverts), primary (connected to the distal forelimb), secondary (connected to the ulna), and greater coverts (feathers of the outermost, largest, row of upperwing coverts) are blackish, with the primaries having white shafts and the secondaries having variable silver-gray fringes. The tertials (feathers arising in the brachial region) are silver-gray with a brownish tinge. The underwing has grayish-brown remiges with white shafts to the outer primary feathers. The and covert feathers are dark, with a broad, silver–gray central area. The tail is dark gray with a variable silvery cast. The lower mandible is blackish, with a greenish-black gular pouch at the bottom for draining water when it scoops out prey. The breast and belly are dark, and the legs and feet black. It has a grayish white bill tinged with brown and intermixed with pale carmine spots. The crest is short and pale reddish-brown in color. The back, rump, and tail are streaked with gray and dark brown, sometimes with a rusty hue. The male and female are similar, but the female is slightly smaller. It is exceptionally buoyant due to the internal air sacks beneath its skin and in its bones. It is as graceful in the air as it is clumsy on land.

The nonbreeding adult has a white head and neck, and the pre-breeding adult has a creamy yellow head. The pink skin around the eyes becomes dull and gray in the non-breeding season. It lacks any red hue, and the pouch is strongly olivaceous ochre tinged and the legs are olivaceous gray to blackish-gray. It has pale blue to yellowish white irides which become brown during the breeding season. During courtship, the bill becomes pinkish red to pale orange, redder at the tip, and the pouch is blackish. Later in the breeding season the bill becomes pale ash-gray over most of the upper jaw and the basal third of the mandible.

The juvenile is similar, but is grayish-brown overall and has paler underparts. The head, neck, and thighs are dusky-brown, and the abdomen is dull white. The plumage of the male is similar to a fully adult female, although the male&#x27;s head feathers are rather rigid. The tail and flight feathers are browner than those of the adult. It has short, brown upperwing coverts, which are often darker on greater coverts, and dull brownish-gray underwing coverts with a whitish band at the center. The irides are dark brown and the facial skin is bluish. It has a gray bill which is horn-yellow to orange near the tip, with a dark gray to pinkish-gray pouch. It acquires adult plumage at over 3 years of age, when the feathers on the neck become paler, the upperparts become striped, the greater upperwing and median coverts become grayer, and the belly acquires dark spots.

The brown pelican is readily distinguished from the American white pelican by its nonwhite plumage, smaller size, and habit of diving for fish from the air, as opposed to co-operative fishing from the surface. It and the Peruvian pelican are the only true marine pelican species.

The brown pelican produces a wide variety of harsh, grunting sounds, such as a low-pitched &quot;hrrraa-hrra&quot;, during displays. The adult also rarely emits a low croak, while young frequently squeal.

==Distribution and habitat==
The brown pelican lives on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts in the Americas. On the Atlantic Coast, it is found from the New Jersey coast to the mouth of the Amazon River. Along the Pacific Coast, it is found from British Columbia to northern Peru, including the Galapagos Islands. After nesting, North American birds move in flocks further north along the coasts, returning to warmer waters for winter. In the non-breeding season, it is found as far north as Canada. It is a rare and irregular visitor south of Piura in Peru, where generally it is replaced by the Peruvian pelican, and can occur as a non-breeding visitor south at least to Ica during El Niño years. Small numbers of brown pelicans have been recorded from Arica in far northern Chile. It is fairly common along the coast of California, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, the West Indies, and many Caribbean islands as far south as Guyana. Along the Gulf Coast, it inhabits Alabama, Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Mexico.

The brown pelican is a strictly marine species, primarily inhabiting marine subtidal, warm estuarine, and marine pelagic waters. It is also found in mangrove swamps, and prefers shallow waters, especially near salty bays and beaches. It avoids the open sea, seldom venturing more than 20 miles from the coast. Some immature birds may stray to inland freshwater lakes. Its range may also overlap with the Peruvian pelican in some areas along the Pacific coast of South America. It roosts on rocks, water, rocky cliffs, piers, jetties, sand beaches, and mudflats.

=== Migration ===
Most brown pelican populations are resident (nonmigratory) and dispersive (species moving from its birth site to its breeding site, or its breeding site to another breeding site). Some migration is observed, especially in the northern parts of the species&#x27;s range, but these movements are often erratic, depending on local conditions.

While usually restricted to coastal regions, brown pelicans occasionally wander inland, and there are records of vagrant individuals across much of the interior of North America. The species also occasionally wanders along the coasts of the Americas outside its normal range, with vagrants reported as far north as Southeast Alaska and Newfoundland, as far south as central Chile (well into the range of the closely related Peruvian pelican), and as far east in South America as Alagoas. Rare inland vagrants, generally caused by hurricanes or El Niño phenomena, have been reported from the Colombian Andes. They were first recorded in July 2009 in the Interandean Valley, where they remained for at least 161 days. There are four records far inland in Amazônia Legal, along the Amazon River and its tributaries.

==Behavior==
The brown pelican is a very gregarious bird; it lives in flocks of both sexes throughout the year. In level flight, brown pelicans fly in groups, with their heads held back on their shoulders and their bills resting on their folded necks. They may fly in a V formation, but usually in regular lines or single file, often low over the water&#x27;s surface. To exclude water from the nasal passage, they have narrower internal regions of the nostrils.

=== Feeding ===

The brown pelican is a piscivore, primarily feeding on fish. Menhaden may account for 90% of its diet, and the anchovy supply is particularly important to the brown pelican&#x27;s nesting success. Other fish preyed on with some regularity includes pigfish, pinfish, herring, sheepshead, silversides, mullets, sardines, minnows, and topminnows. Brown pelicans residing in Southern California rely especially heavily on pacific sardine as a major food source which can compose up to 26% of their diet, making them one of the top three predators of sardines in the area. Non-fish prey includes crustaceans, especially prawns, and it occasionally feeds on amphibians and the eggs and nestlings of birds (egrets, common murres and its own species).

As the brown pelican flies at a maximum height of above the ocean, it can spot schools of fish while flying. When foraging, it dives bill-first like a kingfisher, often submerging completely below the surface momentarily as it snaps up prey. Besides its sister species, the Peruvian pelican, this is the only pelican to primarily forage via diving, all other extant pelican merely float on the waters&#x27; surface when foraging. Upon surfacing, it spills the water from its throat pouch before swallowing its catch. Only the Peruvian pelican shares this active foraging style (although that species never dives from such a great height), while other pelicans forage more inactively by scooping up corralled fish while swimming on the water surface. It is an occasional target of kleptoparasitism by other fish-eating birds such as gulls, skuas, and frigatebirds. They are capable of drinking saline water due to the high capacity of their salt glands to excrete salt.

===Breeding===
The brown pelican is a monogamous breeder within a breeding season, but does not pair for life. Nesting season peaks during March and April. The male chooses a nesting site and performs a display of head movements to attract a female. At the proposed nest site, major courtship displays such as head swaying, bowing, turning, and upright (standing on its legs without any support) are performed by both the sexes. They may also be accompanied by low &quot;raaa&quot; calls.

Once a pair forms a bond, overt communication between them is minimal. It is a colonial species, with some colonies maintained for many years. Probably owing to disturbance, tick infestation, or alteration in food supply, colonies frequently shift. It nests in secluded area, often on islands, vegetated spots among sand dunes, thickets of shrubs and trees, and in mangroves, although sometimes on cliffs, and less often in bushes or small trees. Nesting territories are clumped, as individual territories may be at a distance of just from each other. They are usually built by the female from reeds, leaves, pebbles, and sticks, and consist of feather-lined impressions protected with a rim of soil and debris. They are usually found above the ground. Renesting may occur if eggs are lost from the nest early in the breeding season.

There are usually two to three, or sometimes even four, oval eggs in a clutch, and only one brood is raised per year. The egg is chalky white, and can measure about in length and in width. Incubation takes 28 to 30 days with both sexes sharing duties, keeping the eggs warm by holding them on or under their webbed feet. It takes 28 to 30 days for the eggs to hatch, and about 63 days to fledge. After that, the juvenile leave the nest and gather into small groups known as pods. The newly hatched chicks are pink and weigh about . Within 4 to 14 days, they turn gray or black. After that, they develop a coat of white, black or grayish down. Fledging success may be as high as 100% for the first hatched chick, 60% for the second chick, and just 6% for the third chick.

The parents regurgitate predigested food for the young to feed upon until they reach their fledging stage. After about 35 days, the young venture out of the nest by walking. The young start flying about 71 to 88 days after hatching. The adults remain with them until some time afterwards and continue to feed them. In the 8- to 10-month period during which they are cared for, the nestling pelicans are fed by regurgitated, partially digested food of around of fish. The young reach sexual maturity (and full adult plumage) at anywhere from three to five years of age. A brown pelican has been recorded to have lived for over 31 years in captivity.

=== Predators and parasites ===

Predation is occasional at colonies, and predators of eggs and young (usually small nestlings are threatened but also occasionally up to fledgling size depending on the size of the predator) can include gulls, raptors (especially bald eagles), spiny-tailed iguanas, alligators, vultures, feral cats, feral dogs, raccoons, fish crows, and corvids. Predation is likely reduced if the colony is on an island. Although it is rare, bobcats have been documented eating both the offspring and injured adults. Predation on adult brown pelicans is rarely reported, but cases where they have fallen prey to bald eagles have been reported. Also, South American sea lions and unidentified large sharks have been observed to prey on adult brown pelicans by seizing them from beneath while the birds are sitting on ocean waters. In California, adult brown pelicans have become a common prey item for North American river otters.

The invasive red imported fire ant is known to prey on hatchlings. Like all pelicans, brown pelicans are highly sensitive to disturbances by humans (including tourists or fishermen) at their nests, and may even abandon their nests. Due to their size, non-nesting adults are rarely predated. Brown pelicans have several parasitic worms such as &quot;Petagiger&quot;, &quot;Echinochasmus&quot;, &quot;Phagicola longus&quot;, &quot;Mesostephanus appendiculatoides&quot;, &quot;Contracaecum multipapillatum&quot;, and &quot;Contracaecum bioccai&quot;, from its prey diet of black mullets, white mullets, and other fish species.

==Relationship with humans==
The brown pelican is now a staple of crowded coastal regions and is at some risk by fishermen (monofilament fishing line and hooks) and boaters. In the early twentieth century, hunting was a major cause of its death, and people still hunt adults for their feathers and collect eggs on the Caribbean coasts, in Latin America, and occasionally in the United States, even though it is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

=== Depictions in culture ===
The brown pelican is the national bird of Saint Martin, Barbados, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. In 1902, it was made a part of the official Louisiana seal and, in 1912, a pelican and her young became part of the Flag of Louisiana as well. One of Louisiana&#x27;s state nicknames is &quot;The Pelican State&quot;, and the brown pelican is the official state bird of Louisiana. It is one of the mascots of Tulane University, present on its seal, and is also present on the crest of the University of the West Indies. The National Basketball Association (NBA)&#x27;s New Orleans Pelicans are named in the honor of the brown pelican.

In the 1993 film &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by John Grisham, a legal brief speculates that the assassins of two supreme court justices were motivated by a desire to drill for oil on a Louisiana marshland that was a habitat of the endangered brown pelican. In the same year, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; showed a pod of brown pelicans at the end of the film. In 1998, American conductor David Woodard performed a requiem for a California brown pelican on the seaward limit of the berm of a beach where the animal had fallen. In the 2003 Disney/Pixar film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, a brown pelican (voiced by Geoffrey Rush in an Australian accent) was illustrated as a friendly, virtuous talking character named Nigel.

===Status and conservation===

Since 1988, the brown pelican has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species based on its large range—greater than 20,000 km2 (7700 mi2)—and an increasing population trend. The population size is also well beyond the threshold for vulnerable species. The nominate race population is thought to number at least 290,000 in the West Indies, and 650,000 globally. In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt set aside Pelican Island, now known as Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge, to solely protect the brown pelican from hunters.

Starting in the 1940s with the invention and extensive use of pesticides such as DDT, the brown pelican population had drastically declined due to a lack of breeding success. By the 1960s, it had almost disappeared along the Gulf Coast and, in southern California, it had suffered almost total reproductive failure, due to DDT usage in the United States. The brown pelican was listed under the United States Endangered Species Act from 1970 to 2009. A research group from the University of Tampa, headed by Ralph Schreiber, conducted research in Tampa Bay, and found that DDT caused the pelican eggshells to be too thin to support the embryo to maturity. In 1972, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) banned DDT usage in the United States and limited the use of other pesticides. There has been a decline in chemical contaminant levels in brown pelican eggs since then, and a corresponding increase in its nesting success. It became extinct in 1963 in Louisiana. Between 1968 and 1980, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries&#x27; reintroduction program re-established the brown pelican, and its population numbers in California and Texas were restored due to improved reproduction and natural recolonization of the species. By 1985, its population in the eastern United States, including Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, and northward along the Atlantic Coast, had recovered and the species was removed from the Endangered Species List. Its population has grown by about 68% per decade over a period of 40 years in North America, and this trend appears to be continuing. It is still listed as endangered in the Pacific Coast region of its range and in the southern and central United States. Although the United States Gulf Coast populations in Louisiana and Texas are still listed as endangered, they were recently estimated in 2009 about 12,000 breeding pairs. Since that time the Deepwater Horizon oil spill has adversely affected populations, and current population figures are not available.

==== Indicator species ====
The brown pelican abundance has steadily recovered from the drastic population decreases in the 1940s, however bottom up control threatens the Southern California populations as food sources become diminished. It is common for forage fish populations to experience regular fluctuations, however there has been a consistent decrease in the Pacific sardine population beginning as early as 2014. In 2019 these declines were found to have reached levels which were a mere 10% of the highest reported abundances. Fluctuations in sardine populations have largely been attributed to bottom-up control, primarily including climate variability and ocean temperature. The significant decrease in pacific sardine population can be linked to the levels of nitrogen within their habitat, a limiting factor in plankton production. Pacific sardines in the California current system rely on wind driven upwelling to push cooler, nitrogen rich waters towards the surface, maintaining a sustainable, nutrient abundant environment. Continued environmental disruptions, such as El Niño, rising ocean temperatures, and increased commercial fishing, have drastic effects on nutrient cycling within the California current system, leading to lasting impacts on Pacific sardine productivity and reproductive success.

The brown pelican has been predicted to have high vulnerability to declining sardine populations . At the lowest levels of sardine abundance, the brown pelican population has been predicted to decline up to 50%. Even with a more moderate decline in sardine abundance (50% relative abundance), brown pelicans have been predicted to decrease by up to 27%. A recent decline in brown pelican breeding success coincides with the population decline of the Pacific sardine. Between 2014 and 2016, brown pelicans experienced a continuous breeding failure. These breeding failures have been characterized by decreased numbers of pelicans arriving at nesting colonies, large scale abandonment and early migration due to an inability to feed hatchlings, and sub-optimal breeding by those who do attempt to breed. Breeding success is greatly reduced by oceanic anomalies, specifically warm-phase anomalies that increase the intensity of upwellings. Increased upwellings disrupt marine productivity and forage fish availability. These trends have important implications for the health and conservation of brown pelicans, as well as other seabirds.

Seabirds have become increasingly important as an indicator species. They are often used in order to indirectly track changes in fish stocks, ecosystem health, and climate change. Environmental changes tend to have fast acting impacts on marine bird populations due to the simplicity of their trophic cascade, allowing for complex, long term trends in ecosystem health and resources to be easily realized and tracked. Brown pelicans have proven to be a useful indicator in determining the effects of the well-established fishing industry in Southern California. Sardine fishery in the Gulf of California has been showing signs of overfishing since the early 1990s. Sardine population and abundance, however, is difficult to monitor and obtain indicators for. Since lacking food availability has negative implications for breeding success in seabirds, seabird diet, and breeding success have been used to indirectly measure the population status of the fish they feed on. This model has been shown to work using brown pelicans as an indicator species. As the proportion of sardines in the brown pelican&#x27;s diet decreases, the success of fisheries declines to a lesser extent. When eventually the sardine abundance has declined enough for brown pelicans to move away and begin feeding on other forage fish, commercial fishing still would be fishing in significant numbers. This indicates that even when fisheries are not seeing signs of declining sardine abundance, brown pelicans may have already been affected to the point of locating other food sources. This availability of sardines may decline even further during El Niño anomalies, when thermoclines prevent brown pelicans from reaching their prey. Brown pelican diet will mostly indicate declines in sardine abundance for fisheries during the same season, as brown pelicans feed mostly on the same adult fish that are commercially fished. Although brown pelicans serve as an important indicator species for fisheries, declining sardine abundance due to both climate changes and overfishing have huge implications on overall ecosystem health, within or outside the individual trophic cascade.

<text>Prolactin (PRL), also known as lactotropin and mammotropin, is a protein best known for its role in enabling mammals to produce milk. It is influential in over 300 separate processes in various vertebrates, including humans. Prolactin is secreted from the pituitary gland in response to eating, mating, estrogen treatment, ovulation and nursing. It is secreted heavily in pulses in between these events. Prolactin plays an essential role in metabolism, regulation of the immune system and pancreatic development.

Discovered in non-human animals around 1930 by Oscar Riddle and confirmed in humans in 1970 by Henry Friesen, prolactin is a peptide hormone, encoded by the &quot;PRL&quot; gene.

In mammals, prolactin is associated with milk production; in fish it is thought to be related to the control of water and salt balance. Prolactin also acts in a cytokine-like manner and as an important regulator of the immune system. It has important cell cycle-related functions as a growth-, differentiating- and anti-apoptotic factor. As a growth factor, binding to cytokine-like receptors, it influences hematopoiesis and angiogenesis and is involved in the regulation of blood clotting through several pathways. The hormone acts in endocrine, autocrine, and paracrine manners through the prolactin receptor and numerous cytokine receptors.

Pituitary prolactin secretion is regulated by endocrine neurons in the hypothalamus. The most important of these are the neurosecretory tuberoinfundibulum (TIDA) neurons of the arcuate nucleus that secrete dopamine (a.k.a. Prolactin Inhibitory Hormone) to act on the D2 receptors of lactotrophs, causing inhibition of prolactin secretion. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone has a stimulatory effect on prolactin release, although prolactin is the only anterior pituitary hormone whose principal control is inhibitory.

Several variants and forms are known per species. Many fish have variants &quot;prolactin A&quot; and &quot;prolactin B&quot;. Most vertebrates, including humans, also have the closely related somatolactin. In humans, 14, 16, and 22 kDa variants exist.

== Function ==

=== In humans ===
Prolactin has a wide variety of effects. It stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk (lactation): increased serum concentrations of prolactin during pregnancy cause enlargement of the mammary glands and prepare for milk production, which normally starts when levels of progesterone fall by the end of pregnancy and a suckling stimulus is present. Prolactin plays an important role in maternal behavior.

It has been shown in rats and sheep that prolactin affects lipid synthesis differentially in mammary and adipose cells. Prolactin deficiency induced by bromocriptine increased lipogenesis and insulin responsiveness in adipocytes while decreasing them in the mammary gland.

In general, dopamine inhibits prolactin but this process has feedback mechanisms.

Elevated levels of prolactin decrease the levels of sex hormones—estrogen in women and testosterone in men. The effects of mildly elevated levels of prolactin are much more variable, in women, substantially increasing or decreasing estrogen levels.

Prolactin is sometimes classified as a gonadotropin although in humans it has only a weak luteotropic effect while the effect of suppressing classical gonadotropic hormones is more important. Prolactin within the normal reference ranges can act as a weak gonadotropin, but at the same time suppresses gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. The exact mechanism by which it inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone is poorly understood. Although expression of prolactin receptors have been demonstrated in rat hypothalamus, the same has not been observed in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons. Physiologic levels of prolactin in males enhance luteinizing hormone-receptors in Leydig cells, resulting in testosterone secretion, which leads to spermatogenesis.

Prolactin also stimulates proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. These cells differentiate into oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for the formation of myelin coatings on axons in the central nervous system.

Other actions include contributing to pulmonary surfactant synthesis of the fetal lungs at the end of the pregnancy and immune tolerance of the fetus by the maternal organism during pregnancy. Prolactin promotes neurogenesis in maternal and fetal brains.

In music psychology, it is conjectured that prolactin may play a role in the pleasurable perception of sad music, as the levels of the hormone increase when a person feels sad, producing a consoling psychological effect.

=== In other vertebrates ===

The primary function of prolactin in fish is osmoregulation, i.e., controlling the movement of water and salts between the tissues of the fish and the surrounding water. Like mammals, however, prolactin in fish also has reproductive functions, including promoting sexual maturation and inducing breeding cycles, as well as brooding and parental care. In the South American discus, prolactin may also regulate the production of a skin secretion that provides food for larval fry. An increase in brooding behaviour caused by prolactin has been reported in hens.

Prolactin and its receptor are expressed in the skin, specifically in the hair follicles, where they regulate hair growth and moulting in an autocrine fashion. Elevated levels of prolactin can inhibit hair growth, and knock-out mutations in the prolactin gene cause increased hair length in cattle and mice. Conversely, mutations in the prolactin receptor can cause reduced hair growth, resulting in the &quot;slick&quot; phenotype in cattle. Additionally, prolactin delays hair regrowth in mice.

Analogous to its effects on hair growth and shedding in mammals, prolactin in birds controls the moulting of feathers, as well as the age at onset of feathering in both turkeys and chickens. Pigeons, flamingos and male emperor penguins feed their young a cheese-like secretion from the upper digestive tract called crop milk, whose production is regulated by prolactin.

In rodents, pseudopregnancy can occur when a female is mated with a sterile male. This mating can cause bi-daily surges of prolactin which would normally occur in rodent pregnancy. Prolactin surges initiate the secretion of progesterone which maintains pregnancy and hence can initiate pseudopregnancy. The false maintenance of pregnancy exhibits the outward physical symptoms of pregnancy, in the absence of a foetus.

Prolactin receptor activation is essential for normal mammary gland development during puberty in mice. Adult virgin female prolactin receptor knockout mice have much smaller and less developed mammary glands than their wild-type counterparts. Prolactin and prolactin receptor signaling are also essential for maturation of the mammary glands during pregnancy in mice.

== Regulation ==
In humans, prolactin is produced at least in the anterior pituitary, decidua, myometrium, breast, lymphocytes, leukocytes and prostate.

=== Pituitary ===

Pituitary prolactin is controlled by the Pit-1 transcription factor, which binds to the gene at several sites including a proximal promoter. This promoter is inhibited by dopamine and stimulated by estrogens, neuropeptides, and growth factors. Estrogens can also suppress dopamine.

Interaction with neuropeptides is still a matter of active research: no specific prolactin-releasing hormone has been identified. It is known that mice react to both VIP and TRH, but humans seem to only react to TRH. There are prolactin-releasing peptides that work &quot;in vitro&quot;, but whether they deserve their name has been questioned. Oxytocin does not play a large role. Mice without a posterior pituitary do not raise their prolactin levels even with suckling and oxytocin injection, but scientists have yet to identify which specific hormone produced by this region is responsible.

In birds (turkeys), VIP is a powerful prolactin-releasing factor, while peptide histidine isoleucine has almost no effect.

=== Extrapituitary ===
Extrapituitary prolactin is controlled by a superdistal promoter, located 5.8 kb upstream of the pituitary start site. The promoter does not react to dopamine, estrogens, or TRH. Instead, it is stimulated by cAMP. Responsiveness to cAMP is mediated by an imperfect cAMP–responsive element and two CAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP). Progesterone upregulates prolactin synthesis in the endometrium but decreases it in myometrium and breast glandular tissue.

Breast and other tissues may express the Pit-1 promoter in addition to the distal promoter. Oct-1 appears able to substitute for Pit-1 in activating the promoter in breast cancer cells.

Extrapituitary production of prolactin is thought to be special to humans and primates and may serve mostly tissue-specific paracrine and autocrine purposes. It has been hypothesized that in vertebrates such as mice a similar tissue-specific effect is achieved by a large family of prolactin-like proteins controlled by at least 26 paralogous &quot;PRL&quot; genes not present in primates.

=== Stimuli ===
Prolactin follows diurnal and ovulatory cycles. Prolactin levels peak during REM sleep and in the early morning. Many mammals experience a seasonal cycle.

During pregnancy, high circulating concentrations of estrogen and progesterone increase prolactin levels by 10- to 20-fold. Estrogen and progesterone inhibit the stimulatory effects of prolactin on milk production. The abrupt drop of estrogen and progesterone levels following delivery allow prolactin—which temporarily remains high—to induce lactation.

Sucking on the nipple offsets the fall in prolactin as the internal stimulus for them is removed. The sucking activates mechanoreceptors in and around the nipple. These signals are carried by nerve fibers through the spinal cord to the hypothalamus, where changes in the electrical activity of neurons that regulate the pituitary gland increase prolactin secretion. The suckling stimulus also triggers the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland, which triggers milk let-down: Prolactin controls milk production (lactogenesis) but not the milk-ejection reflex; the rise in prolactin fills the breast with milk in preparation for the next feed. The posterior pituitary produces a yet-unidentified hormone that causes prolactin production.

In usual circumstances, in the absence of galactorrhea, lactation ceases within one or two weeks following the end of breastfeeding.

Levels can rise after exercise, high-protein meals, minor surgical procedures, following epileptic seizures or due to physical or emotional stress. In a study on female volunteers under hypnosis, prolactin surges resulted from the evocation, with rage, of humiliating experiences, but not from the fantasy of nursing. Stress-induced PRL changes are not linked to the posterior pituitary in rodents.

Hypersecretion is more common than hyposecretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most frequent abnormality of the anterior pituitary tumors, termed prolactinomas. Prolactinomas may disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as prolactin tends to suppress the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and in turn decreases the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone from the anterior pituitary, therefore disrupting the ovulatory cycle. Such hormonal changes may manifest as amenorrhea and infertility in females as well as erectile dysfunction in males. Inappropriate lactation (galactorrhoea) is another important clinical sign of prolactinomas.

== Structure and isoforms ==

The structure of prolactin is similar to that of growth hormone and placental lactogen. The molecule is folded due to the activity of three disulfide bonds. Significant heterogeneity of the molecule has been described, thus bioassays and immunoassays can give different results due to differing glycosylation, phosphorylation and sulfation, as well as degradation. The non-glycosylated form of prolactin is the dominant form that is secreted by the pituitary gland.

The three different sizes of prolactin are:
* Little prolactin—the predominant form. It has a molecular weight of approximately 23-kDa. It is a single-chain polypeptide of 199 amino acids and is apparently the result of removal of some amino acids.
* Big prolactin—approximately 48 kDa. It may be the product of interaction of several prolactin molecules. It appears to have little, if any, biological activity.
* Big big prolactin—approximately 150 kDa. It appears to have a low biological activity.
* Other variants with the molecular masses of 14, 16, and 22 kDa.
The levels of larger ones are somewhat higher during the early postpartum period.

== Prolactin receptor ==
Prolactin receptors are present in the mammillary glands, ovaries, pituitary glands, heart, lung, thymus, spleen, liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal gland, uterus, skeletal muscle, skin and areas of the central nervous system. When prolactin binds to the receptor, it causes it to dimerize with another prolactin receptor. This results in the activation of Janus kinase 2, a tyrosine kinase that initiates the JAK-STAT pathway. Activation also results in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Src kinase.

Human prolactin receptors are insensitive to mouse prolactin.

== Diagnostic use ==
Prolactin levels may be checked as part of a sex hormone workup, as elevated prolactin secretion can suppress the secretion of follicle stimulating hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, leading to hypogonadism and sometimes causing erectile dysfunction.

Prolactin levels may be of some use in distinguishing epileptic seizures from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. The serum prolactin level usually rises following an epileptic seizure.

== Units and unit conversions ==

The serum concentration of prolactin can be given in mass concentration (μg/L or ng/mL), molar concentration (nmol/L or pmol/L), or international units (typically mIU/L). The current IU is calibrated against the third International Standard for Prolactin, IS 84/500. Reference ampoules of IS 84/500 contain &quot;approximately&quot; 2.5 μg of lyophilized human prolactin and have been assigned an activity of 0.053 International Units by calibrating against the previous standard. Measurements can be converted into mass units using this ratio of grams to IUs to obtain an equivalent in relationship to the contents of IS 84/500; prolactin concentrations expressed in mIU/L can be converted to μg/L of IS 84/500 equivalent by dividing by 21.2. Previous standards had other ratios in relation to their potency on the assay measurement. For example, the previous IS (83/562) had a potency of 27.0 mIU per μg.

The first International Reference Preparation (or IRP) of human Prolactin for Immunoassay was established in 1978 (75/504 1st IRP for human prolactin) at a time when purified human prolactin was in short supply. Previous standards relied on prolactin from animal sources. Purified human prolactin was scarce, heterogeneous, unstable, and difficult to characterize. A preparation labeled 81/541 was distributed by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization without official status and given the assigned value of 50 mIU/ampoule based on an earlier collaborative study. It was determined that this preparation behaved anomalously in certain immunoassays and was not suitable as an IS.

Three different human pituitary extracts containing prolactin were subsequently obtained as candidates for an IS. These were distributed into ampoules coded 83/562, 83/573, and 84/500. Collaborative studies involving 20 different laboratories found little difference between these three preparations. 83/562 appeared to be the most stable. This preparation was largely free of dimers and polymers of prolactin. On the basis of these investigations, 83/562 was established as the Second IS for human prolactin. Once stocks of these ampoules were depleted, 84/500 was established as the Third IS for human prolactin.

84/500 has nearly run out and in 2016 replacement was proposed. The new 83/573 contains 67.2 mIU per ampoule when calibrated against the third IS and contains 1.002 g of human pituitary extract each (which is then lyophilized). Each ampoule contains approximately 3.2 μg of prolactin. The &quot;assigned value&quot; will be 67 mIU per ampoule. If a fifth IS is needed, it will likely be based on recombinant protein, as WHO has not received any further donations of human pituitary extracts.

== Reference ranges ==
General guidelines for diagnosing prolactin excess (hyperprolactinemia) define the upper threshold of normal prolactin at 25 μg/L for women and 20 μg/L for men. Similarly, guidelines for diagnosing prolactin deficiency (hypoprolactinemia) are defined as prolactin levels below 3 μg/L in women and 5 μg/L in men. However, different assays and methods for measuring prolactin are employed by different laboratories and as such the serum reference range for prolactin is often determined by the laboratory performing the measurement. Furthermore, prolactin levels vary according to factors as age, sex, menstrual cycle stage and pregnancy. The circumstances surrounding a given prolactin measurement (assay, patient condition, etc.) must therefore be considered before the measurement can be accurately interpreted.

The following chart illustrates the variations seen in normal prolactin measurements across different populations. Prolactin values were obtained from specific control groups of varying sizes using the IMMULITE assay.

=== Inter-method variability ===

The following table illustrates variability in reference ranges of serum prolactin between some commonly used assay methods (as of 2008), using a control group of healthy health care professionals (53 males, age 20–64 years, median 28 years; 97 females, age 19–59 years, median 29 years) in Essex, England:
An example of the use of the above table is, if using the Centaur assay to estimate prolactin values in μg/L for females, the mean is 168 mIU/L (7.92 μg/L) and the reference range is 71–348 mIU/L (3.35–16.4 μg/L).

== Conditions ==

=== Elevated levels ===
Hyperprolactinaemia, or excess serum prolactin, is associated with hypoestrogenism, anovulatory infertility, oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhoea, unexpected lactation and loss of libido in women and erectile dysfunction and loss of libido in men.

=== Decreased levels ===

Hypoprolactinemia, or serum prolactin deficiency, is associated with ovarian dysfunction in women, and arteriogenic erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, oligozoospermia, asthenospermia, hypofunction of seminal vesicles and hypoandrogenism in men. In one study, normal sperm characteristics were restored when prolactin levels were raised to normal values in hypoprolactinemic men.

Hypoprolactinemia can result from hypopituitarism, excessive dopaminergic action in the tuberoinfundibular pathway and ingestion of D2 receptor agonists such as bromocriptine.

==In medicine==
Prolactin is available commercially for use in other animals, but not in humans. It is used to stimulate lactation in animals. The biological half-life of prolactin in humans is around 15–20 minutes. The D2 receptor is involved in the regulation of prolactin secretion, and agonists of the receptor such as bromocriptine and cabergoline decrease prolactin levels while antagonists of the receptor such as domperidone, metoclopramide, haloperidol, risperidone, and sulpiride increase prolactin levels. D2 receptor antagonists like domperidone, metoclopramide, and sulpiride are used as galactogogues to increase prolactin secretion in the pituitary gland and induce lactation in humans.

After beginning her career in Shakespearean theatre she rose to fame for her performance in William Wyler&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Collector&quot; (1965), which earned her a Golden Globe Award, a Cannes Film Festival Award and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

She later appeared as Emma Fairfax in &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967) and the American drama &quot;The Molly Maguires&quot; (1970). In the early 1970s Eggar moved to the United States and Canada, where she later starred in several horror films, including &quot;The Dead Are Alive&quot; (1972), &quot;The Uncanny&quot; (1977) and David Cronenberg&#x27;s cult thriller &quot;The Brood&quot; (1979).

Her television work includes roles on &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and a recurring part as Charlotte Devane in the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; in 2000.

==Early life==
Samantha Eggar was born Victoria Louise Samantha Marie Elizabeth Therese Eggar on 5 March 1939 in Hampstead, London, to Ralph Alfred James Eggar (a brigadier in the British Army) and Muriel Olga Palache-Bouma, who was of Dutch and Portuguese descent. The initials of the two triplets of given names form the initials of each of her parents&#x27; first lovers. Soon after her birth, her family moved to rural Bledlow, Buckinghamshire, during World War II, where she spent her childhood.

Eggar was brought up as a Roman Catholic and educated at St Mary&#x27;s Providence Convent in Woking, Surrey. Reflecting on her time at convent school, Eggar said: &quot;The nuns didn&#x27;t have too much success with me – I&#x27;ve always had a violent temper. In fact, once I almost killed one of the nuns.&quot; At age 16 she began to go by the name Samantha. Although Eggar expressed interest in acting at a young age, she was urged against a career in the theatre by her parents. She was offered a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts but instead studied fashion for two years at the Thanet School of Art. After completing her studies she enrolled at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

==Career==
===Theatre and early work===
Eggar began her acting career in several Shakespearean companies, notably playing Titania in a 1962 production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; directed by Tony Richardson. She also appeared on stage in a production of Douglas Seale&#x27;s &quot;Landscape with Figures&quot;, where she was noticed by a talent scout. From there she was cast in the biographical film &quot;Dr. Crippen&quot; (1962) opposite Donald Pleasence. Her second film role was in 1962 in &quot;The Wild and the Willing&quot;; in the same year she appeared on stage again as Olivia in a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; by George Devine.

In 1963 she played the lead role of Claire Avery in &#x27;Marcia&#x27;, a second-season episode of &quot;The Saint&quot;. After her appearance in &quot;The Saint&quot; Eggar did not appear on television for 10 years, instead focusing exclusively on feature films. 

In 1965 Eggar appeared in the thriller &quot;The Collector&quot;, directed by William Wyler, playing a kidnap victim. She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress and won a Golden Globe award for her performance. She was also awarded Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival in 1966. On her role as Miranda in &quot;The Collector&quot; Eggar has said: &quot;My biggest relationship on set was with William Wyler. The tension on set was real. And if the tension wasn&#x27;t there – if I didn&#x27;t exude precisely what he wanted – well, Willi just poured cold water over me.&quot;

The following year Eggar starred in the comedy &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; (1966) with Cary Grant (his last motion picture) and Jim Hutton, followed by a lead role as Emma Fairfax in Richard Fleischer&#x27;s musical adaptation of &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967). She also appeared in &quot;The Walking Stick&quot;, a psychological thriller by Eric Till where she costarred with David Hemmings, &quot;The Molly Maguires&quot; (1970), a social drama directed by Martin Ritt in which she starred with Sean Connery and Richard Harris, and &quot;The Light at the Edge of the World&quot; (1971), an adventure movie from a novel by Jules Verne in which she shared the screen with Kirk Douglas and Yul Brynner. 

She also played the main character in &quot;The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun&quot; (1970), a thriller based on a book by French novelist Sébastien Japrisot and the last film directed by Anatole Litvak. She then went to Italy to shoot &quot;The Dead Are Alive&quot; (1972), a giallo directed by Armando Crispino.

Although she co-starred with Yul Brynner in the television series &quot;Anna and the King&quot; (1972) she did not make another television guest appearance until 1973, when she starred in the episode &#x27;The Cardboard House&#x27; of the romantic anthology series &quot;Love Story&quot;. That same year she played Phyllis Dietrichson in a TV remake of the 1944 film &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;.

In 1973, Eggar moved to the United States, settling in Los Angeles, and appeared first in television, guest-starring in episodes of &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&#x27;, Hart to Hart and &quot;Columbo&quot;, the latter with Peter Falk and Theodore Bikel in the episode &#x27;The Bye-Bye Sky High IQ Murder Case&#x27;. She would go on to star in a number of horror films, including &quot;A Name for Evil&quot; (1973) and &quot;&quot;Demonoid Messenger of Death&quot;&quot; (1981). 

During this period, Eggar also appeared in two British-Canadian co-productions, &quot;Welcome to Blood City&quot;, an early &quot;virtual-reality&quot; thriller directed by Peter Sasdy in which she plays opposite Jack Palance and Keir Dullea, and &quot;The Uncanny&quot;, a horror movie directed by Denis Héroux. 
Eggar was also in the Canadian movie &quot;Why Shoot the Teacher?&quot;, a dramatic comedy filmed in Alberta by Silvio Narizzano that went on to be the most successful Canadian movie that year. But it is another Canadian movie that was to become one of Samantha&#x27;s best known film, David Cronenberg&#x27;s cult sci-fi film &quot;The Brood&quot; (1979).

In 1980, she filmed the Canadian slasher film &quot;Curtains&quot;, released in 1983.

She also appeared as Maggie Gioberti in &#x27;The Vintage Years&#x27;, the pilot for the drama &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, but was replaced by Susan Sullivan when the series went into production. She appeared twice on The Love Boat, first charming ship&#x27;s captain, Merrill Stubing (played by Gavin McLeod), as fortune-teller Mary-Louise Murphy in 2 March 1979&#x27;s &#x27;A Funny Valentine&#x27;. Her second sailing, in &#x27;Touchdown Twins&#x27;, which was aired on 14 February 1981, was as Meg Chase, the mother of Billy (played by Philip Brown (actor)) whose friend Frank (played by Vincent Van Patten) develops a crush on Eggar&#x27;s character. She appeared in the drama &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (1992), followed by the superhero film &quot;The Phantom&quot; (1996). In 1997, she provided the voice of Hera in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Hercules&quot;; she would also supply the voice for the subsequent television series. Eggar also had a role in the sci-fi thriller &quot;The Astronaut&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1999), which starred Johnny Depp.

She has appeared as the wife of Captain Jean-Luc Picard&#x27;s brother Robert on the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and as Sarah Templeton, the wife of Speaker of the House Nathan Templeton (Donald Sutherland), on the short-lived television series &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, which starred Geena Davis. In the year 2000, she had a brief run as Charlotte Devane in the American soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. In 2003, she appeared in the first season of &quot;Cold Case&quot;, episode 14 (&quot;The Boy in the Box&quot;) as Sister Vivian.

<text>The Collector is a 1963 thriller novel by English author John Fowles, in his literary debut. Its plot follows a lonely young man who kidnaps a female art student in London and holds her captive in the cellar of his rural farmhouse. Divided in two sections, the novel contains both the perspective of the captor, Frederick, and that of Miranda, the captive. The portion of the novel told from Miranda&#x27;s perspective is presented in epistolary form.

Fowles wrote the novel between November 1960 and March 1962. It was adapted into an Academy Award–nominated feature film of the same name in 1965 starring Terence Stamp and Samantha Eggar.

==Plot==
The novel is about a lonely young man, Frederick Clegg, who works as a clerk in a city hall and collects butterflies in his spare time. The first part of the novel tells the story from his point of view.

Clegg is obsessed with Miranda Grey, a middle-class art student at the Slade School of Fine Art. He admires her from a distance but is unable to make any contact with her because he is socially underdeveloped. One day, he wins a large prize in the football pools. He quits his job and buys an isolated house in Sussex near Lewes. He feels lonely, however, and wants to be with Miranda. Unable to make any normal contact, Clegg decides to add her to his &quot;collection&quot; of pretty, preserved objects, in the hope that if he keeps her captive long enough, she will grow to love him.

After careful preparations, he kidnaps Miranda by drugging her with chloroform and locks her up in the cellar of his house. He is convinced that Miranda will start to love him after some time. However, when she wakes up, she confronts him with his actions. Clegg is embarrassed and promises to let her go after a month. He promises to show her &quot;every respect&quot;, pledging not to sexually molest her and to shower her with gifts and the comforts of home, on one condition: she can&#x27;t leave the cellar.

The second part of the novel is narrated by Miranda in the form of fragments from a diary that she keeps during her captivity. Miranda reminisces over her previous life throughout this section of the novel; and many of her diary entries are written either to her sister or to a man named G.P., whom she respected and admired as an artist. Miranda reveals that G.P. ultimately fell in love with her and consequently severed all contact with her.

At first, Miranda thinks that Clegg has sexual motives for abducting her; but, as his true character begins to be revealed, she realises that this is not true. She begins to pity her captor, comparing him to Caliban in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot; because of his hopeless obsession with her. Clegg tells Miranda that his first name is Ferdinand (eventual winner of Miranda&#x27;s affections in &quot;The Tempest&quot;).

Miranda tries to escape several times, but Clegg stops her. She also tries to seduce him to convince him to let her go. The only result is that he becomes confused and angry. As Clegg repeatedly refuses to release her, she begins to fantasise about killing him. After a failed attempt to do so, Miranda enters a period of self-loathing. She decides that to kill Clegg would lower her to his level. She refrains from any further attempts to do so. Before she can try to escape again, she becomes seriously ill and dies.

The third part of the novel is narrated by Clegg. At first, he wants to commit suicide after he finds Miranda dead; but, after he reads in her diary that she never loved him, he decides that he is not responsible for what happened to her and is better off without her. He buries her corpse in the garden. The book ends with his thinking of kidnapping another girl.

==Analysis and themes==
===Social class===
Literary scholars have noted the theme of class in the British caste system as a prominent point of interest in the novel. Critic Hayden Carruth noted that Fowles is preoccupied with &quot;reshuffling classes under British socialism&quot;, evoked in the differences in social background between the characters of the working-class Frederick, and Miranda, a member of the bourgeoisie.

Some scholars have compared the power struggle between Frederick and Miranda as exemplifying the Hegelian &quot;master–slave dialectic&quot;, and that each exerts power over the other—both physically and psychologically—despite their differences in social background. Pamela Cooper writes in her book &quot;The Fictions of John Fowles: Power, Creativity, Femininity&quot;, that &quot;The Collector&quot; &quot;dramatizes the clash between a socially entrenched, wealthy middle class and an underprivileged but upwardly mobile working or lower middle class.&quot; Additionally, Cooper views the novel as a Gothic-inspired work presenting this class struggle &quot;with an insistence on the tedium of Miranda&#x27;s ordeal.&quot;

===Absurdism and irony===
In the &quot;Journal of Modern Literature&quot;, scholar Shyamal Bagchee attests that the novel possesses an &quot;ironic-absurdist view&quot; and contains a significant number of events which are hinged purely on chance. He compares the world of the novel to the &quot;tragically absurd worlds&quot; of Franz Kafka and Samuel Beckett&#x27;s novels. &quot;The world of &quot;The Collector&quot;, especially towards the end, is &quot;not our world&quot;; however, it is similar to the view of the world we have in our darkest hours.&quot;

Bagchee notes the novel&#x27;s greatest irony being that Miranda seals her own fate by continually being herself, and that through &quot;each successive escape attempt she alienates and embitters Clegg the more.&quot; Despite this, Bagchee views &quot;The Collector&quot; as a &quot;horrifying&quot; and &quot;ironic&quot; love story: 
Furthermore, Bagchee notes Miranda&#x27;s evolution as a character only while in captivity as another paradox in the novel: &quot;Her growing up is finally futile; she learns the true meaning of existentialist choice when, in fact, she has very limited actual choice. And she learns to understand herself and her life when, in effect, that life has come to a standstill.&quot; Cooper, who interprets the novel as a critique of &quot;masculine sexual idealization&quot;, notes another paradox in the way the novel connects both photography and collecting as &quot;twin obscenities in order to show the erotic worshipper, with his puritanical hatred of &#x27;the crude animal thing&#x27; and his belief in his &#x27;own higher aspirations&#x27;, is himself prey to the desires he tries to reject.&quot;

===Narrative technique===
Bagchee notes that the divided narrative structure of the novel—which first presents the perspective of Frederick, followed by that of Miranda (the latter divulged in epistolary form via scattered diary entries)—has the characters mirroring each other in a manner that is &quot;richly ironic and reveals of a sombre and frightening view of life&#x27;s hazards.&quot; Bagchee notes that &quot;the two narrations frequently agree not only about physical descriptions of incidents that take place, but often also in the way two very different characters react similarly to given situations or display similar attitudes.&quot;

Scholar Katarina Držajić considers &quot;The Collector&quot; &quot;one of the most prominent novels of the 20th century, [which] may be viewed from many interesting perspectives – as a psychological thriller, a Jungian study, a modern or postmodern piece of literature. John Fowles is well established as a master of language, using a variety of tools to convey different meanings and bring his characters closer to his reader.&quot;

==Reception==
Alan Pryce-Jones of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of the novel: &quot;John Fowles is a very brave man. He has written a novel which depends for its effect on total acceptance by the reader. There is no room in it for the least hesitation, the smallest false note, for not only is it written in the first person singular, but its protagonist is a very special case indeed. Mr. Fowles&#x27;s main skill is in his use of language. There is not a false note in his delineation of Fred.&quot; Hayden Carruth of the &quot;Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin&quot; praised the novel as &quot;brisk&quot; and &quot;professional,&quot; adding that Fowles &quot;knows how to evoke the oblique horror of innocence as well as the direct horror of knowledge.&quot;

In 2014, Mary Andrews of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;Fowles invites us to defy his main character&#x27;s excuses and read between the lines, and the facts paint a more chilling picture. Fred doesn&#x27;t accidentally abduct Miranda, there&#x27;s a sense that he&#x27;s been leading up to this event his whole life,&quot; and deemed Frederick Clegg &quot;one of literature&#x27;s most evil characters.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
&quot;The Collector&quot; has been adapted as a film and several times as a play. It&#x27;s also referred to in various songs, television episodes and books; one example is in Stephen King&#x27;s book &quot;Misery&quot;, when the protagonist Paul Sheldon hopes that Annie Wilkes is not familiar with &quot;John Fowles&#x27;s first novel.&quot;

The novel was adapted as a feature film by the same name in 1965. The screenplay was by Stanley Mann and John Kohn, and it was directed by William Wyler, who turned down &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; to direct it. It starred Terence Stamp and Samantha Eggar. The 1980 Tamil language film &quot;Moodu Pani&quot;, according to its director Balu Mahendra, is partly based on &quot;The Collector&quot;. The novel was also loosely adapted by Filipino director Mike de Leon into a film titled &quot;Bilanggo sa Dilim&quot; (&quot;Prisoner in the Dark&quot;) in 1986. The 1997 Finnish drama film &quot;Neitoperho&quot; was loosely inspired by the novel, according to the film&#x27;s director.

A stage adaptation by the actor Brian McDermott (writing as David Parker) was first performed in 1971; among its earliest productions was a West End presentation at the St Martin&#x27;s Theatre in 1974, with Marianne Faithfull as Miranda and Simon Williams as Clegg. Another adaptation – written, again, by an actor: Mark Healy – was first performed at Derby Playhouse in October 1998, later appearing at Sweden&#x27;s Gothenburg English Studio Theatre in April 2007. Yet another adaptation, by Tim Dalgleish and Caz Tricks, was written for Bare Bones Theatre Company (of Wolverton, Milton Keynes) in 1997.

In October 2021, Suntup Editions announced a limited 1000 editions of the novel with an introduction by Bradford Morrow and six illustrations by David Álvarez.

== Associations with serial killers ==
In several cases since the novel was published, serial killers, spree killers, kidnappers, and other criminals have claimed that &quot;The Collector&quot; was the basis, the inspiration, or the justification for their crimes.

===Leonard Lake and Charles Ng===

In 1985, Leonard Lake and Charles Chi-Tat Ng abducted 18-year-old Kathy Allen and later 19-year-old Brenda O&#x27;Connor. Lake is said to have been obsessed with &quot;The Collector.&quot; Lake described his plan for using the women for sex and housekeeping in a &quot;philosophy&quot; videotape. The two are believed to have murdered at least 25 people, including two entire families. Although Lake had committed several crimes in the Ukiah, California, area, his &quot;Operation Miranda&quot; did not begin until after he moved to remote Wilseyville, California. The videotapes of his murders and a diary written by Lake were found buried near the bunker in Wilseyville. They revealed that Lake had named his plot &quot;Operation Miranda&quot; after the character in Fowles&#x27; book.

===Christopher Wilder===
Christopher Wilder, a spree/serial killer of young girls, had &quot;The Collector&quot; in his possession when he was killed by police in 1984.

===Robert Berdella===
In 1988, Robert Berdella held his male victims captive and photographed their torture before killing them. He claimed that the film version of &quot;The Collector&quot; had been his inspiration when he was a teenager.

<text>Piero della Francesca ( , ; ; ; – 12 October 1492) was an Italian painter, mathematician and geometer of the Early Renaissance, nowadays chiefly appreciated for his art. His painting is characterized by its serene humanism, its use of geometric forms and perspective. His most famous work is the cycle of frescoes &quot;The History of the True Cross&quot; in the Basilica of San Francesco in the Tuscan town of Arezzo.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Piero was born Piero di Benedetto in the town of Borgo Santo Sepolcro, modern-day Tuscany, to Benedetto de&#x27; Franceschi, a tradesman, and Romana di Perino da Monterchi, members of the Florentine and Tuscan Franceschi noble family. His father died before his birth, and he was called Piero della Francesca after his mother, who was referred to as &quot;la Francesca&quot; due to her marriage into the Franceschi family (similar to Lisa Gherardini who was known as &quot;la Gioconda&quot; through her marriage into the Giocondo family). Romana supported his education in mathematics and art.

He was most probably apprenticed to the local painter Antonio di Giovanni d&#x27;Anghiari, because in documents about payments it is noted that he was working with Antonio in 1432 and May 1438. He certainly took notice of the work of some of the Sienese artists active in San Sepolcro during his youth; e.g. Sassetta. In 1439 Piero received, together with Domenico Veneziano, payments for his work on frescoes for the church of Sant&#x27;Egidio in Florence, now lost. In Florence he must have met leading masters like Fra Angelico, Luca della Robbia, Donatello, and Brunelleschi. The classicism of Masaccio&#x27;s frescoes and his majestic figures in the Santa Maria del Carmine were for him an important source of inspiration. Dating of Piero&#x27;s undocumented work is difficult because his style does not seem to have developed over the years.

===Mature work===
Piero returned to his hometown in 1442 and was elected to the City Council of Sansepolcro. Three years later, he received his first commission, to paint the &quot;Madonna della Misericordia&quot; altarpiece for the church of the Misericordia in Sansepolcro, which was completed in the early 1460s. In 1449 he executed several frescoes in the Castello Estense and the church of Sant&#x27;Andrea of Ferrara, now also lost. His influence was particularly strong in the later Ferrarese allegorical works of Cosimo Tura.

The &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;, now in the National Gallery in London, was completed in about 1450 for the high altar of the church of the Priory of S. Giovanni Battista at Sansepolcro. Other notable works are the frescoes of &quot;The Resurrection&quot; in Sansepolcro, and the &quot;Madonna del parto&quot; in Monterchi, near Sansepolcro.
Two years later he was in Rimini, working for the condottiero Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. In 1451, during that sojourn, he executed the famous fresco of &quot;St. Sigismund and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta&quot; in the Tempio Malatestiano, as well as a portrait of Sigismondo. In Rimini, Piero may have met the famous Renaissance mathematician and architect Leon Battista Alberti, who had redesigned the Tempio Malatestiano, although it is known that Alberti directed the execution of his designs for the church by correspondence with his building supervisor. Thereafter Piero was active in Ancona, Pesaro and Bologna.

In 1454, he signed a contract for the &quot;Polyptych of Saint Augustine&quot; in the church of Sant&#x27;Agostino in Sansepolcro. The central panel of this polyptych is lost, and the four panels of the wings, with representations of saints, are now scattered around the world. A few years later, summoned by Pope Nicholas V, he moved to Rome, where he executed frescoes in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, of which only fragments remain. Two years later he was again in the Papal capital, painting frescoes in the Vatican Palace, which have since been destroyed.

===Frescoes in San Francesco at Arezzo===
In 1452, Piero della Francesca was called to Arezzo to replace Bicci di Lorenzo in painting the frescoes of the basilica of San Francesco. The work was finished in 1464.
&quot;The History of the True Cross&quot; cycle of frescoes is generally considered among his masterworks and those of Renaissance painting in general. The story in these frescoes derives from legendary medieval sources as to how timber relics of the True Cross came to be found. These stories were collected in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; of Jacopo da Varazze (Jacopo da Varagine) of the mid-13th century.

===Piero&#x27;s activity in Urbino===
At some point, Giovanni Santi invited Piero to Urbino, where Piero &quot;executed several commissions for Duke Federico da Montefeltro.&quot; &quot;The Flagellation&quot; is generally considered Piero&#x27;s oldest work in Urbino (c. 1455–1470). It is one of the most famous and controversial pictures of the early Renaissance. As discussed in its own entry, it is marked by an air of geometric sobriety, in addition to presenting a perplexing enigma as to the nature of the three men standing at the foreground.
Another famous work painted in Urbino is the &quot;Double Portrait&quot; of Federico and his wife Battista Sforza, in the Uffizi. The portraits in profile take their inspiration from large bronze medals and stucco roundels with the official portraits of Federico and his wife. Other paintings made in Urbino are the monumental Montefeltro Altarpiece (1474) in the Brera Gallery in Milan and the &quot;Madonna of Senigallia&quot;.

In Urbino Piero met the painters Melozzo da Forlì, Fra Carnevale, and the Flemish Justus van Gent, the mathematician Fra Luca Pacioli, the architect Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and probably also Leon Battista Alberti.

===Later years===
In his later years, painters such as Perugino and Luca Signorelli frequently visited his workshop. He completed the treatise &quot;On Perspective in Painting&quot; in the mid-1470s to 1480s. By 1480, his vision began to deteriorate, but he continued writing treatises such as &quot;Short Book on the Five Regular Solids&quot; in 1485. It is documented that Piero rented a house in Rimini in 1482. Piero made his will in 1487 and he died five years later, on 12 October 1492, in his own house in Sansepolcro. He left his possessions to his family and the church.

==Criticism and interpretation==

In a 2013 exhibition, the Frick Collection in New York collected seven of the eight paintings of Piero known to exist in the United States. Of the seven paintings in the exhibit, critic Jerry Saltz writing in &quot;New York&quot; magazine singled out Piero&#x27;s &quot;Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels&quot; for its exemplary qualities. 

Saltz wrote, &quot;The Virgin and child are elevated two steps. They are in a world itself apart from this world apart. Mary isn&#x27;t looking at her child and looks instead at the rose he reaches for. You begin to glean the revelation she is having. The flower represents love, devotion, and beauty. It also symbolizes blood and the crown of thorns Christ will wear. This child who will suffer a horrendous death reaches for his acceptance of fate. Mary does not pull the flower back. You sense an inner agony, noticing her deep-blue robe open to reveal scarlet beneath, symbol of outward passion and pain to come. In the dead-center vertical line of the painting is Christ&#x27;s right palm that will be nailed to the cross.&quot;

By contrast, Walter Kaiser, reviewing the exhibition in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, wrote, &quot;The most splendid picture in the Frick exhibition is the magnificent figure of Saint Augustine from the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Lisbon, a companion to Saint John the Evangelist [owned by the Frick Collection] on the Sant&#x27;Agostino altarpiece&quot;.

==Work in mathematics and geometry==

Piero&#x27;s deep interest in the theoretical study of perspective and his contemplative approach to his paintings are apparent in all his work.
In his youth, Piero was trained in mathematics, which most likely was for mercantilism. Three treatises written by Piero have survived to the present day: &quot;&quot;, &quot;De quinque corporibus regularibus&quot; (&quot;On the Five Regular Solids&quot;) and &quot;De Prospectiva pingendi&quot; (&quot;On Perspective in painting&quot;). The subjects covered in these writings include arithmetic, algebra, geometry and innovative work in both solid geometry and perspective. Much of Piero&#x27;s work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably Luca Pacioli. Piero&#x27;s work on solid geometry was translated in Pacioli&#x27;s &quot;Divina proportione&quot;, a work illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci. Biographers of his patron Federico da Montefeltro of Urbino record that he was encouraged to pursue the interest in perspective which was shared by the Duke.

In the late 1450s, Piero copied and illustrated the following works of Archimedes: &quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot;, &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot;, &quot;On Conoids and Spheroids&quot;, &quot;On Spirals&quot;, &quot;On the Equilibrium of Planes&quot;, &quot;The Quadrature of the Parabola&quot;, and &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;. The manuscript consists of 82 folio leaves, is held in the collection of the Biblioteca Riccardiana and is a copy of the translation of the Archimedean corpus made by Italian humanist Iacopo da San Cassiano.

==Inspirations==
Bohuslav Martinů wrote a three movement work for orchestra entitled &quot;Les Fresques de Piero della Francesca&quot;. Dedicated to Rafael Kubelik, it was premiered by Kubelik and the Vienna Philharmonic at the 1956 Salzburg Festival. 

Piero&#x27;s geometrical perfection and the almost magic atmosphere of the light in his painting inspired modern painters like Giorgio de Chirico, Massimo Campigli, Felice Casorati, and Balthus.

<text>Mary Elizabeth Hartman (December 23, 1943 – June 10, 1987) was an American actress of stage and screen. She debuted in the popular 1965 film &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot;, playing a blind girl named Selina D&#x27;Arcy, opposite Sidney Poitier, a role for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year.

She appeared in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; as Barbara Darling, for which she was nominated for a second Golden Globe Award. She also starred in Don Siegel&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;The Beguiled&quot;, opposite Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page, and in 1973 film &quot;Walking Tall&quot;. 

Hartman voiced Mrs. Brisby in Don Bluth&#x27;s first animated feature, &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; (1982). However, this proved to be her last Hollywood film and TV role, as well as her only animated role.

On June 10, 1987, Hartman died after jumping from the window of her fifth floor apartment. Earlier that morning, she had reportedly called her psychiatrist saying that she felt despondent. Hartman was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the suburb of her hometown.

== Early life ==
Mary Elizabeth Hartman was born December 23, 1943, in Youngstown, Ohio, the daughter of Claire (née Mullaly) and B.C. Hartman. She had a sister, Janet, and a brother, William. She was a standout dramatic student at Boardman High School, where she graduated in 1961. She won a statewide award for best actress in a high school production for her performance as Laura in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. She performed in several productions at the Youngstown Playhouse during her youth, including &quot;A Clearing in the Woods&quot; by Arthur Laurents and &quot;Our Town&quot;. She attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where she met her future husband, Gill Dennis, and spent her summers acting with the Kenley Players.

Hartman also performed at the Cleveland Playhouse in several productions, including &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; and &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. She was encouraged to move to New York City and begin auditioning for plays there. In 1964, Hartman was signed to play the ingénue lead in the comedy &quot;Everybody Out, the Castle is Sinking&quot;, which was not a success, however her performance was again positively received, and film producers took notice.

== Career ==

In 1964, Hartman was screen-tested by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Brothers. In the early autumn of 1964, she was cast in the leading role in &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot;, opposite Sidney Poitier and Shelley Winters. Hartman won widespread critical acclaim for her performance, a fact proudly noted by the news media in her hometown, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. During this time, her father, who worked in construction, died. At the time of her nomination in 1966, Hartman (who was 23 years old) was the youngest nominee ever in the Best Actress category. That same year, she received an achievement award from the National Association of Theatre Owners. Hartman also won a Golden Globe for New Star of the Year for her performance. In 1966, she starred as Laura opposite Mercedes McCambridge as Amanda in a production of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; in Pittsburgh.

In January 1967, columnist Dorothy Manners reported that Hartman had been cast in the role of Neely O&#x27;Hara in the movie version of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, beating out some more famous Hollywood actresses. She had allegedly made a successful screen test winning over director Mark Robson and producer David Weisbart, the former already enthralled with her performance in &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot;. However, the following month, it was announced that Oscar-winner Patty Duke had signed on to play Neely, albeit against her agent&#x27;s advice. Duke&#x27;s over the top performance almost ruined her career. 

Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, Hartman appeared in three well-received films, two of which starred Broadway and Hollywood legend Geraldine Page, &quot;The Group&quot; (1966), &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; (1966), and &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (1971). Portraying Pauline Mullins, the wife of former Sheriff Buford Pusser, she starred in the cult classic and major box office hit &quot;Walking Tall&quot; (1973). In 1975, Hartman starred in the premiere of Thomas Rickman&#x27;s play &quot;Balaam&quot;, a play about political intrigue in Washington, D.C. The production was mounted in Old Town Pasadena, California, by the Pasadena Repertory Theatre located in The Hotel Carver. It was directed by Hartman&#x27;s husband, Gill Dennis. In 1981, she starred in a touring production of &quot;Morning&#x27;s at Seven&quot;, but left the tour due to declining mental health. Her last on-screen performance was in 1981&#x27;s horror-spoof, &quot;Full Moon High&quot;, where she appeared as Miss Montgomery. In 1982, she appeared in Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;, where she portrayed the film&#x27;s protagonist, Mrs. Brisby. She was highly praised for the performance; however, this proved to be her last Hollywood film role, as well as her only animated role.

==Later years and death==
Throughout much of her life, Hartman suffered from depression. In 1978, she was treated at The Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1984, she divorced her husband, screenwriter Gill Dennis, after a five-year separation. In the last few years of her life, she quit acting and worked at a museum in Pittsburgh while receiving treatment for her condition at an outpatient clinic. In 1981, she returned to theater, portraying Myrtle Brown in a regional stage production of &quot;Morning&#x27;s at Seven&quot;. Her sister and caretaker, Janet, told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:

On June 10, 1987, Hartman died by suicide, leaping to her death from the window of her fifth floor Pittsburgh apartment. She was 43 years old. Earlier that morning, according to the Allegheny County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office, she had reportedly called her psychiatrist saying that she felt despondent. Hartman was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the suburb of her hometown.

<text>A Man and a Woman () is a 1966 French romantic drama film directed by Claude Lelouch and starring Anouk Aimée and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Written by Pierre Uytterhoeven and Lelouch, the film concerns a young widow and widower who meet by chance at their children&#x27;s boarding school and whose budding relationship is complicated by the memories of their deceased spouses. The film is known for its lush photography, which features frequent segues among full color, black-and-white, and sepia-toned shots, and for its music score by Francis Lai.

&quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; sold a total of 4,272,000 cinema tickets in France and was the sixth highest-grossing film of the year. In the United States, the film grossed $14 million. The film won several awards, including the at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival, two Golden Globe Awards for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress – Drama (for Aimée), and two Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay. A sequel, &quot;A Man and a Woman: 20 Years Later&quot;, was released in 1986, followed by &quot;The Best Years of a Life&quot;, which was released in 2019.

==Plot==
A young widow, Anne Gauthier, is raising her daughter Françoise alone following the death of her husband, who worked as a stuntman and died in a film set accident that she witnessed. Still working as a film script supervisor, Anne divides her time between her home in Paris and Deauville in northern France, where her daughter attends boarding school. A young widower, Jean-Louis, is raising his son Antoine alone following the death of his wife Valerie, who committed suicide after Jean-Louis was in a near-fatal crash during the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Still working as a race car driver, Jean-Louis divides his time between Paris and Deauville, where his son also attends boarding school.

One day, Anne and Jean-Louis meet at the Deauville boarding school after Anne misses the last train back to Paris. Jean-Louis offers her a lift, and the two become acquainted during the drive home, enjoying each other&#x27;s company. When he drops her off, he asks if she would like to drive up together the following weekend, and she gives him her phone number. After a busy week at the track preparing for the next race, Jean-Louis calls, and they meet early Sunday morning and drive to Deauville in the rain. Clearly attracted to each other, they enjoy a pleasant Sunday lunch with their children, who get along well. Later that afternoon, they go for a boat ride followed by a walk on the beach at sunset.

Jean-Louis spends the following week preparing for and driving in the Monte Carlo Rally in southeast France. Every day, Anne closely follows news reports of the race, which takes place in poor weather conditions along the icy roads of the French Riviera. Of the 273 cars that started the race, only 42 were able to finish, including Jean-Louis&#x27;s white Ford Mustang, number 145. Watching the television coverage of the conclusion of the race, Anne sends Jean-Louis a telegram that reads, &quot;Bravo! I love you. Anne.&quot;

That night at a dinner for the drivers at the Monte Carlo Casino, Jean-Louis receives the telegram and leaves immediately. He jumps into the other Mustang (number 184) used during the race and drives through the night to Paris, telling himself that when a woman sends a telegram like that, you go to her no matter what. Along the way, he imagines what their reunion will be like. At her Paris apartment, Jean-Louis learns that Anne is in Deauville, so he continues north. Jean-Louis finally arrives in Deauville and finds Anne and the two children playing on the beach. When they see each other, they run into each other&#x27;s arms and embrace.

After dropping their children off at the boarding school, Jean-Louis and Anne drive into town where they rent a room and have passionate sex. While they are in each other&#x27;s arms, however, Jean-Louis senses that something is not right. Anne&#x27;s memories of her deceased husband are still with her, and she feels uncomfortable continuing. Anne says it would be best for her to take the train back to Paris alone. After dropping her off at the station, Jean-Louis drives home alone, unable to understand her feelings. On the train, Anne can only think of Jean-Louis and their time together. Meanwhile, Jean-Louis drives south through the French countryside to the Paris train station, just as her train is arriving. As she leaves the train, she spots Jean-Louis and is surprised, hesitates briefly, and then walks toward him, and they embrace.

==Production==
===Story and script===
According to director Claude Lelouch, the story originated from an experience following his disappointment trying to get a distribution deal for his film &quot;The Grand Moments&quot;. As was his habit during troubling times, he went for a long drive and ended up on the shore at Deauville at 2:00 am. After a few hours sleep in the car, he was awakened by the sunrise and saw a woman walking on the beach with her daughter and a dog. This sparked his creativity which led to the story and script which he co-wrote with Pierre Uytterhoeven within a month.

The title may have come from a line in the film, where Jean-Louis and Anne are listening to the news on the radio driving in a fast Ford Mustang and a commentator says, &quot;A man and a woman have just died after skidding in a powerful car&quot;. This leads to a discussion about how well he is driving and Anne commenting &quot;you are average&quot;.

===Casting===
A key casting decision for Lelouch was Jean-Louis Trintignant:
 For the female lead, Trintignant asked Lelouch who his ideal woman would be, and Lelouch indicated Anouk Aimée, who had appeared in Fellini&#x27;s films &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960) and &quot;8½&quot; (1962). Trintignant happened to be a close friend of hers and told him to call her. When he did, she accepted without reading the script. Although early disagreements and the low-budget skeleton crew caused initial tension between the director and actress, they quickly resolved their differences and the two went on to become close friends.

===Filming===
Once the script was drafted, the film was made relatively quickly, with one month of pre-production work, three weeks of principal photography, and three weeks editing. Due to budget constraints, he used an older handheld camera that was not soundproof, so blankets were frequently employed to dampen the camera noise.

Lelouch is considered a pioneer in mixing different film stocks: black-and-white with colour, and 35mm with 16mm and super 8. For years, film critics debated the symbolism of the mixed film stocks, but Lelouch acknowledged that the primary reason was that he was running out of money, and black-and-white stock was cheaper. His original plan involved shooting strictly in black and white, but when an American distributor offered him $40,000 to film in colour, he filmed the outdoor sequences in colour, and the indoor scenes in black and white.

The music soundtrack was recorded prior to filming, and Lelouch would play the music on the set to inspire the actors. Lelouch encouraged his actors to improvise some of the dialogue, and several key scenes were improvised. The climactic scene at a railway station was not scripted at the time of shooting, and Aimée did not know that director Lelouch had decided on the two main characters reuniting at the end. The look of surprise on Aimée&#x27;s face is genuine.

The film was shot, among others, in Paris, Monte Carlo and Deauville. The love scene was shot in the Hotel Barrière Le Normandy Deauville which, in memory of the film, has a suite entitled &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned theatrical rentals of $4.6 million in the United States and Canada and $4 million internationally during its initial theatrical release. It played for 83 weeks in Boston, 73 weeks in Syracuse and 61 weeks in Seattle. An English-language version of the film was shown in the United States and Canada from 1 July 1968, and the film eventually earned rentals of $6.3 million in the US and Canada.

It was the sixth most popular film at the French box office in 1966, after &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot;, &quot;Dr Zhivago&quot;, &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot;, &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and &quot;Lost Command&quot;.

===Critical response===
Upon its theatrical release in the United States, &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; received mostly positive reviews. In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Bosley Crowther wrote: &quot;For a first-rate demonstration of the artfulness of a cameraman and the skill at putting together handsome pictures and a strongly sentimental musical score, there is nothing around any better than Claude Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;&quot;. Crowther lauded the &quot;beautiful and sometimes breath-taking exposition of visual imagery intended to excite the emotions&quot; and praised the director for his ability to create something unique from the commonplace:
The review in &quot;Variety&quot; commented on the performances of the lead actors: &quot;Anouk Aimee has a mature beauty and an ability to project an inner quality that helps stave off the obvious banality of her character, and this goes too for the perceptive Jean-Louis Trintignant as the man&quot;.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.

The film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

===Accolades===
==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack was written by Francis Lai and received Best Original Score nominations at both the BAFTA Awards and Golden Globe Awards in 1967. The film&#x27;s theme song, with music by Lai and lyrics by Pierre Barouh, was also nominated for Best Original Song in a Motion Picture at the Golden Globe Awards. In Finland, it has become one of the most easily recognizable TV advertisement themes, having been used for decades by the cruise ferry brand Silja Line.

Pierre Barouh, who plays the deceased husband in the film, also sings the songs in the soundtrack. In a sequence of the film, he makes a brief reappearance singing &quot;Samba Saravah&quot;, a French version with lyrics by Barouh himself of the Brazilian bossa nova song &quot;Samba da Benção&quot; written by Baden Powell with original lyrics by Vinicius de Moraes.

&quot;Aujourd&#x27;hui c&#x27;est toi&quot; is used as the theme for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; current affairs program, It is also used for Rede Globo&#x27;s &quot;Jornal Hoje&quot; midday newscast, and YLE&#x27;s &quot;Ajankohtainen kakkonen&quot; weekly current affairs television program in Finland on TV2 from 1969 to 2015. Harry James recorded a version of the film&#x27;s theme song on his album &quot;For Listening and Dancing&quot;, released in 1981 on Reader&#x27;s Digest RD4A 213.

<text>Francesco Squarcione (&quot;c.&quot; 1395 – after 1468) was an Italian artist from Padua. His pupils included Andrea Mantegna (with whom he had many legal battles), Cosimo Tura and Carlo Crivelli. There are only two works signed by him: the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; (now in Berlin) and the Lazara Altarpiece (now in Padua).

==Biography==
Squarcione, whose original vocation was tailoring, appears to have had a remarkable enthusiasm for ancient art, and a faculty for acting. Squarcione was interested in ancient Rome; he travelled in Italy, and perhaps Greece, collecting antique statues, reliefs, vases, and other works of art, forming a collection of such works, making drawings from them himself, and throwing open his stores for others to study from. Based on this collection, he undertook works on commission for which his pupils no less than himself were made available. As many as 137 painters and pictorial students passed through his school, established in 1431 and which became famous all over Italy. Squarcione&#x27;s favorite pupil was Mantegna. Squarcione taught Mantegna the Latin language and instructed him to study fragments of Roman sculpture.

Squarcione&#x27;s &quot;Polyptych of Lazarus&quot;, originally in the Carmine church in Padua, is now on display in the Museo Civici di Padua at the former Eremitani monastery.

Pupils or followers of Squarcione include Francesco Verla, Pietro Calzetta, and Andrea Bellunello.

<doc id="214316" wikidata="Q704536" url="?curid=214316" title="London Naval Treaty">
<text>The London Naval Treaty, officially the Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armament, was an agreement between the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Italy, and the United States that was signed on 22 April 1930. Seeking to address issues not covered in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which had created tonnage limits for each nation&#x27;s surface warships, the new agreement regulated submarine warfare, further controlled cruisers and destroyers, and limited naval shipbuilding.

Ratifications were exchanged in London on 27 October 1930, and the treaty went into effect on the same day, but it was largely ineffective.

The treaty was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 6 February 1931.

==Conference==

The signing of the treaty remains inextricably intertwined with the ongoing negotiations, which began before the official start of the London Naval Conference of 1930, evolved throughout the progress of the official conference schedule, and continued for years afterward.

==Terms==
The treaty was seen as an extension of the conditions agreed in the Washington Naval Treaty, an effort to prevent a naval arms race after World War I.

The conference was a revival of the efforts that had gone into the 1927 Geneva Naval Conference at which the various negotiators had been unable to reach agreement because of bad feelings between the British and the American governments. The problem may have initially arisen from discussions held between US President President Herbert Hoover and UK Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald at Rapidan Camp in 1929, but a range of factors affected tensions, which were exacerbated by the other nations at the conference.

Under the treaty, the standard displacement of submarines was restricted to 2,000 tons, with each major power being allowed to keep three submarines of up to 2,800 tons except that France was allowed to keep one. The submarine gun caliber was also restricted for the first time to with one exception, an already-constructed French submarine being allowed to retain guns. That put an end to the &#x27;big-gun&#x27; submarine concept pioneered by the British M class and the French &quot;Surcouf&quot;.

The treaty also established a distinction between cruisers armed with guns up to (&quot;light cruisers&quot; in unofficial parlance) from those with guns up to (&quot;heavy cruisers&quot;). The number of heavy cruisers was limited: Britain was permitted 15 with a total tonnage of 147,000, the Americans were permitted 18, totalling 180,000, and the Japanese were permitted 12, totalling 108,000 tons. For light cruisers, no numbers were specified but tonnage limits were 143,500 tons for the Americans, 192,200 tons for the British, and 100,450 tons for the Japanese.

Destroyer tonnage was also limited, with destroyers being defined as ships of less than 1,850 tons and guns up to . The Americans and the British were permitted up to 150,000 tons and Japan 105,500 tons.

Article 22 relating to submarine warfare declared international law applied to them as to surface vessels. Also, merchant vessels that demonstrated &quot;persistent refusal to stop&quot; or &quot;active resistance&quot; could be sunk without the ship&#x27;s crew and passengers being first delivered to a &quot;place of safety.&quot;

Article 8 outlined smaller surface combatants. Ships between 600 and 2,000 tons, with guns not exceeding with a maximum of four gun mounts above without torpedo armament and up to , were exempt from tonnage limitations. The maximum specifications were designed around the French Bougainville-class avisos, which were in construction at the time.

Warships under 600 tons were also completely exempt. That led to creative attempts to use the unlimited nature of the exemption with the Italian Spica-class torpedo boats, Japanese Chidori-class torpedo boats, French La Melpomène-class torpedo boats and British Kingfisher-class sloops.

==Aftermath==
The next phase of attempted naval arms control was the Second Geneva Naval Conference in 1932. Active negotiations among the other treaty signatories continued during the following years.

That was followed by the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936.

<text>Ida Kamińska (September 18, 1899 – May 21, 1980) was a Polish actress and director. Known mainly for her work in the theatre, she was the daughter of Avrom Yitshok Kaminski (Abraham Isaac Kaminski) and Ester Rachel Kamińska ( Halpern), known as the Mother of the Jewish Stage. The Jewish Theatre in Warsaw, Poland is named in their honor. In her long career Kamińska produced more than 70 plays, and performed in more than 150 productions. She also wrote two plays of her own and translated many works in Yiddish. World War II disrupted her career, and she later immigrated to the United States where she continued to act. In 1967, she directed herself in the lead role of &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; on Broadway. In 1973, she released her autobiography, titled &quot;My Life, My Theater&quot;.

She starred in the 1965 film &quot;The Shop on Main Street&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. For her performance, she received special mention at the Cannes Film Festival, as well as nominations for the Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Early life and career==
She was born in Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), the daughter of Yiddish stage actress Ester Rachel Kamińska (1870–1925) and actor, director and stage producer Abraham Izaak Kamiński (pl) (1867–1918). Her sister was actress Regina Kamińska (pl) and her brother was Joseph Kamiński (pl), a composer. Her mother was described as the &quot;Jewish Eleonora Duse&quot;.
Ida Kamińska began her stage career at the age of six. One of her earliest roles was in Jakob Gordin&#x27;s play &quot;Mirele Efros&quot;, as the grandson of the title character, who was played by her mother. She was acting in both tragedies and comedies, as well as directing plays in her father&#x27;s troupe by the time she was 18.

In 1918 she married the Yiddish actor and director Zygmunt Turkow (1896-1970), who was a member of her parents&#x27; troupe. She and Turkow had a daughter, Ruth Kamińska-Turkow, who was born in 1919. Following a three-year tour of the Kamiński theater in the Soviet Union, the young couple settled in Warsaw, and together established the Warsaw Jewish Art Theater, in 1922, with Ida Kamińska as the principal actress. They divorced in 1932, and in the same year Ida organized her own company in Warsaw, the Drama Theater of Ida Kamińska, which she continued to direct until 1939. In July 1936 Kamińska married the Yiddish actor Marian (Meir) Melman (1900-1978).

In October 1939, in the early part of the Second World War, Kamińska and family members, including her husband, Melman, and daughter, Ruth, fled to Lwów (Lviv, Ukraine), which was under Soviet occupation. There she was able to direct a Yiddish theater funded by the Soviet authorities. She and her family took shelter with friends there, and were under surveillance by Soviet authorities, due to their performances being deemed as anti-Hitler (the USSR and Nazi Germany had recently signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact). Kamińska and her family were subsequently relocated to various localities in the Soviet Union, ending up in the Kirghiz SSR, present-day Kyrgyzstan. Her and Melman&#x27;s son, Victor, was born in Frunze (Bishkek), in Soviet Central Asia, in fall 1941. In 1944 they came to Moscow, where Kamińska again acted in Yiddish productions.

==Postwar career==
After the war, Kamińska and her family returned to Warsaw. The Polish Jewish population had been decimated by the events of the Holocaust. Nevertheless, Kamińska and Melman made the decision to try to reestablish the Jewish theater. A Yiddish theater reopened in Warsaw in November 1946. In 1949, the Polish government granted a subsidy for the establishment of the Jewish State Theater of Poland, with Kamińska serving as its artistic director. 

Composer Shaul Berezovsky, who had also returned to Poland after the war, wrote music for this new theatre. In its early period the theater toured between the cities of Łódź (1949-1953) and Wrocław (1953-1955). In 1955, it was established permanently in Warsaw, as the State Jewish Theater, later named after Ida and her mother Ester (the Ester Rachel Kamińska and Ida Kamińska State Jewish Theater). Ida Kamińska continued to direct the theater until 1968.
 In 1957, she toured Israel for the first time, where she performed for Prime Minister 
In 1965, she starred as Mrs. Lautmann in the Czechoslovak movie &quot;The Shop on Main Street&quot; (&quot;Obchod na korze,&quot; directed by Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos), for which she received a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the 39th Academy Awards.

In protest against a government antisemitic campaign during the events of March 1968, she left Poland forever in July 1968, first to Israel and eventually New York.

Her last role was &quot;The Angel Levine&quot; (1970), directed by Ján Kadár.

==Death and legacy==
Ida Kamińska died of cardiovascular disease in 1980, aged 80. Her husband, Meir Melman, had died in 1978.

She was interred in the Yiddish theater section of the Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, New York. Also buried in Mount Hebron is Yiddish-American theatre operator Molly Picon.

In 2014, the Jewish Theatre in Warsaw held a special exhibition in her honor. The exhibit featured costumes worn by Kamińska, as well as photographs and memorabilia from her esteemed career.

<text>Carpaccio is a dish of meat or fish (such as beef, veal, venison, salmon or tuna), thinly sliced or pounded thin, and served raw, typically as an appetiser. It was invented in by Giuseppe Cipriani founder of Harry&#x27;s Bar in Venice, Italy, and popularised during the second half of the twentieth century. The beef was served with lemon, olive oil and white truffle or Parmesan cheese. Later, the term was extended to dishes containing other raw meats or fish, thinly sliced and served with lemon or vinegar, olive oil, salt and ground pepper.

==History==

The dish, based on the Piedmont speciality &quot;carne cruda all&#x27;albese&quot;, was invented in 1950 by Cipriani, who originally prepared the dish for countess Amalia Nani Mocenigo when he learned that her doctors had recommended that she eat raw meat. The dish was named &quot;carpaccio&quot; after Vittore Carpaccio, the Venetian painter known for the characteristic red and white tones of his work. Cipriani was reportedly put in mind of Carpaccio because of the major exhibit of the artist&#x27;s work that took place in the Doge&#x27;s Palace at the time.

<doc id="214323" wikidata="Q1387214" url="?curid=214323" title="James Brady">
<text>James Scott Brady (August 29, 1940 – August 4, 2014) was an American public official who served as assistant to the U.S. president and the 17th White House Press Secretary, serving under President Ronald Reagan. In 1981, John Hinckley Jr. shot and wounded Brady during Hinckley’s attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, which occurred two months and ten days after Reagan&#x27;s inauguration.

Brady&#x27;s death in 2014 was eventually ruled a homicide, caused by the gunshot wound he received 33 years earlier on March 30, 1981.

== Early career ==
Brady began his career in public service as a staff member in the office of Republican Illinois senator Everett Dirksen. He is of Irish descent. In 1964, he was the campaign manager for congressional candidate Wayne Jones in the race for Illinois&#x27;s 23rd district. In 1970, Brady directed a campaign in the same district for Phyllis Schlafly.

Brady served in various positions in both the private sector and government, including service as special assistant to Secretary of Housing and Urban Development James Thomas Lynn; special assistant to the director of the Office of Management and Budget; assistant to the Secretary of Defense; and staff member of Senator William V. Roth, Jr. (R-DE). He served as press secretary in 1979 to presidential candidate John Connally.

After Connally withdrew his candidacy, Brady became the director of public affairs and research for the Reagan–Bush Committee, then spokesperson for the Office of the President-elect. After Reagan took office, Brady became White House press secretary.

== Shooting ==

On March 30, 1981, 69 days into his presidency, Ronald Reagan and his cabinet members and staff, including Brady, were leaving the Washington Hilton hotel when a gunman opened fire at the president. The first of six bullets hit Brady. The gunman was 25-year-old John Hinckley Jr., who thought that killing the President would impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom Hinckley had an unhealthy obsession.

Secret Service and police officers forced Hinckley to the ground and arrested him. He had fired six shots from a .22 caliber Röhm RG-14 revolver. The bullet hit Brady in the head above his left eye, passing underneath his brain and shattering his brain cavity, exploding on impact. Later shots also wounded Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy, Metropolitan Police officer Thomas Delahanty, and President Reagan himself, who was hit and seriously wounded by a bullet that ricocheted off the presidential limousine. Of the four men wounded, Brady suffered the worst injuries. He, Reagan and McCarthy were taken to George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C.

During the confusion that ensued from the shooting, all major media outlets reported that Brady had died. At the time, he was 40 years old. When ABC News anchorman Frank Reynolds, a personal friend of Brady, was later forced to retract the report, he angrily said on-air to his staff, &quot;C&#x27;mon, let&#x27;s get it nailed down!&quot;, as a result of the miscommunication.

During the hours-long operation on Brady at the George Washington University Hospital, surgeon Arthur Kobrine was informed of the media&#x27;s announcement of Brady&#x27;s death, to which he said, &quot;No one has told me and the patient.&quot;
Although Brady survived, the wound left him with slurred speech and partial paralysis that required full-time use of a wheelchair. Kobrine, his neurosurgeon, described him as having difficulty controlling his emotions while speaking after the shooting, saying &quot;he would kind of cry-talk for a while&quot;, and having deficits in memory and thinking, such as failing to recognize people.

Brady was unable to work as White House press secretary but remained in the position until the end of the Reagan administration with Larry Speakes and Marlin Fitzwater performing the job on an &quot;acting&quot; or &quot;deputy&quot; basis.

== Gun control advocacy ==
With his wife Sarah Brady, who served as chair of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Brady lobbied for stricter handgun control and assault weapon restrictions. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, also known as &quot;the Brady Bill&quot;, was named in his honor.

==Awards and honors==
In 1982, Brady received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from McKendree College, Lebanon, Illinois. In 1993, Sarah and James Brady were each awarded a doctorate degree of Humane Letters by Drexel University. In 1994, James and Sarah received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by the Jefferson Awards Foundation. 

In 1994, James and Sarah received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1996, Brady received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton, the highest civilian award in the United States.

In 2000, the White House press briefing room was renamed the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room in his honor.

== Personal life ==
Brady married Sue Beh in 1960. The marriage ended in divorce in 1967. In 1972, Brady married Sarah Jane Kemp. They joined an Episcopal church.

== Death ==
Brady died aged 73 on August 4, 2014, in Alexandria, Virginia. Four days later, the medical examiner ruled that his death was a homicide, caused by the gunshot wound that he sustained in 1981. Hinckley did not face any charges for Brady&#x27;s death because he had been found not guilty by reason of insanity. In addition, since Brady&#x27;s death occurred more than 33 years after the shooting, prosecution of Hinckley was barred under the year and a day law in effect in the District of Columbia at the time of the shooting.

== Portrayals in film ==
Brady&#x27;s recovery after the shooting was dramatized in the 1991 HBO film &quot;Without Warning: The James Brady Story&quot;, with Brady portrayed by Beau Bridges. Brady was portrayed by John Connolly in the 2001 Showtime film &quot;The Day Reagan Was Shot&quot;. Michael H. Cole portrayed him in the 2016 television film &quot;Killing Reagan&quot;.

Season 1, Episode 4, &quot;In Control&quot; of the television series &quot;The Americans&quot; takes place on the day of Reagan&#x27;s assassination attempt, as the main characters try to figure out what is happening. The episode depicts the media misreporting Brady having died, before issuing the correction that he is still alive.

<text>The Shop on Main Street (Czech/Slovak: Obchod na korze; in the UK The Shop on the High Street) is a 1965 Czechoslovakian film about the Aryanization program during World War II in the Slovak Republic.

The film was written by Ladislav Grosman and directed by Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos. It was funded by the Czechoslovakian central authorities, produced at the Barrandov Film Studio in Prague, and filmed with a Slovak cast on location in the town of Sabinov in north-eastern Slovakia and on the Barrandov sound stage. It stars Jozef Kroner as the Slovak carpenter Tóno Brtko and Polish actress Ida Kamińska as the Jewish widow Rozália Lautmannová.

The film won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Kamińska was nominated one year later for Best Actress in a Leading Role. It was entered into the 1965 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==

During World War II in a small town in the First Slovak Republic (a client state of Nazi Germany), mild-mannered Slovak carpenter Antonín &quot;Tóno&quot; Brtko is chosen by his brother-in-law, who holds an influential position in the local fascist government, to take over the sewing notions (i.e. haberdasher) shop owned by the elderly Jewish widow Rozália Lautmannová as part of the Aryanization efforts in the country. While Brtko is struggling to explain to Lautmannová, who is nearly deaf, oblivious to the outside world, and generally confused, that he is now her supervisor, Imrich Kuchár, Brtko&#x27;s friend and a Slovak who opposes Aryanization, enters and informs Brtko that the business is unprofitable and Lautmannová relies on donations to make ends meet. Kuchár tells Lautmannová that Brtko has come to help her and connects Brtko with the leadership of the Jewish community of the town, who agree to pay him a regular salary to remain the official Aryan controller of the shop, since, if he quits, he might be replaced by someone more militantly fascist or anti-Semitic.

Brtko lets Lautmannová continue to run things in her shop, spending most of his time fixing her furniture or ineptly trying to assist her with customers, and the pair begin to develop a close relationship. When he hears that the authorities are going to gather the Jewish citizenry of the town and transport them elsewhere en masse, he does not tell Lautmannová and at first considers hiding her, but he starts to question this course of action when the roundup actually begins. Drinking steadily, he eventually loses his nerve and attempts to cajole and then force Lautmannová to join her friends in the street. She finally recognizes that a pogrom is happening and panics. Brtko chases her around inside the shop, but he stops and feels ashamed of himself after he witnesses his other Jewish neighbors actually being carted away. Seeing some soldiers heading toward the shop, he throws Lautmannová, who is in a frenzy, into a closet to hide her. The soldiers just glance in the window and keep walking. When Brtko opens the closet door, he discovers Lautmannová&#x27;s dead body, and, devastated, hangs himself. The movie ends with a fantasy sequence in which the now deceased Lautmannová and Brtko run and dance through the town square together.

==Cast==
&quot;The Shop on Main Street&quot; was filmed on location at the town of Sabinov in north-eastern Slovakia with numerous local extras, whose voices bring in hints of the eastern regional variety of Slovak. Ida Kamińska&#x27;s Polish accent is employed to the same effect.

== Screenplay ==
The screenplay had a bilingual Czech/Slovak history. The screenwriter Ladislav Grosman (1921–1981) was born and grew up in Slovakia, but he was writing in Czech at that point in his career. He published the short story &quot;The Trap&quot; (&quot;Past&quot;), a precursor to the screenplay that contained three themes that made it into the final film, in Czech in 1962. He reworked and expanded this story, still in Czech, as a literary-narrative screenplay that was published in 1964 under the title &quot;The Shop on Main Street&quot; (&quot;Obchod na korze&quot;). This version contained what would become the film&#x27;s storyline, but it was not in a typical (American) screenplay format. Grosman reworked it into a shooting script with Slovak dialogue in cooperation with the film&#x27;s designated directors, Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos.

The only other language in the film, other than Slovak, is Yiddish (which is sometimes misidentified as German), though this is limited to several lines that Mrs. Lautmannová mutters to herself. Her Hebrew reading from the siddur is indistinct.

== Production ==
The film was a collaborative effort between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This collaboration was primarily due to the difficulties faced by the filmmakers in securing funding and logistical support within Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia offered both financial support and access to locations that closely resembled the wartime Slovakian setting of the story. The main filming location was the scenic village of Sabinov in Slovakia, which made the ideal setting for the fictional town portrayed in the movie.

==Score==
The score was composed by Zdenek Liska. It incorporates traditional brass band style music that would have been common in Czechoslovakia during the 1940s. The soundtrack was released on record in the US—the first Czechoslovak movie soundtrack to see such a release.

== Critical response ==
Critics at the time praised the film for its profound exploration of the human psyche in the face of dire circumstances. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100%, based on 15 reviews, with an average score of 9.0/10. &quot;The Shop on Main Street&quot; was particularly lauded for its ability to navigate the delicate balance between humor and tragedy, often using dark humor to highlight the absurdity of the situation.

<doc id="214325" wikidata="Q4955187" url="?curid=214325" title="Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act">
<text>The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Pub.L. 103–159, 107 Stat. 1536, enacted November 30, 1993), often referred to as the Brady Act, the Brady Bill or the Brady Handgun Bill, is an Act of the United States Congress that mandated federal background checks on firearm purchasers in the United States. It also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases until the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was implemented in 1998. Introduced by U.S. representative Chuck Schumer of New York, the Brady Act was a landmark legislative enactment during the Clinton administration. The act was appended to the end of Section 922 of title 18, United States Code. The intention of the act was to prevent persons with previous serious convictions from purchasing firearms. 

== Legislative History ==
Various iterations of the Brady Bill were discussed and rejected by Congress between 1987 and 1993, when it finally became law. 

On February 4, 1987, two Ohio Democrats, Representative Edward F. Feighan and Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, introduced the Brady Bill for the first time in the 100th Congress. In its original form, the Bill mandated a seven-day waiting period between the time a person applied for a handgun and the time the sale could be completed. The Bill was approved as an amendment to the Omnibus Drug Initiative Act by the House Judiciary Committee on a voice vote in June of the following year. However, on September 15, 1988, the Brady Bill was defeated in the House by a vote of 228-182.

In March 1991, the Bill was introduced again into the House of Representatives by Representative Chuck Schumer, but was never brought to a vote.

On February 22, 1993, the bill was reintroduced for the final time by Rep. Schumer leading to the final version being passed in the 103rd Congress on November 11, 1993. It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 30, 1993, and the law went into effect on February 28, 1994.

==Provisions==
The Brady Bill requires that background checks be conducted on individuals before a firearm may be purchased from a federally licensed dealer, manufacturer or importer—unless an exception applies. If there are no additional state restrictions, a firearm may be transferred to an individual upon approval by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) maintained by the FBI. In some states, proof of a previous background check can be used to bypass the NICS check. For example, a state-issued concealed carry permit usually includes a background check equivalent to the one required by the Act. Other alternatives to the NICS check include state-issued handgun purchase permits or mandatory state or local background checks.

In Section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code the Brady Bill prohibits certain persons from shipping or transporting any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce, or receiving any firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or possessing any firearm in or affecting commerce. These prohibitions apply to any person who:

# Has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;
# Is a fugitive from justice;
# Is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance;
# Has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution;
# Is an alien illegally or unlawfully in the United States;
# Has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions;
# Having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced U.S. citizenship;
# Is subject to a court order that restrains the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of such intimate partner;
# Has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, or;
# Is under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.

Section 922(n) of title 18, United States Code makes it unlawful for any person who is under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to ship or transport any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce, or receive any firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.

After a prospective buyer completes the appropriate form, the holder of a Federal Firearms License (FFL) initiates the background check by phone or computer. Most checks are determined within minutes. If a determination is not obtained within three business days then the transfer may legally be completed.

Firearm transfers by unlicensed private sellers that are &quot;not engaged in the business&quot; of dealing firearms are not subject to the Brady Act, but may be covered under other federal, state, and local restrictions. 

The Brady Bill also does not apply to licensed Curios &amp; Relics (C&amp;R) collectors, but only in respect to C&amp;R firearms. The FFL Category 03 Curio &amp; Relic license costs $30 and is valid for three years. Licensed C&amp;R collectors may also purchase C&amp;R firearms from private individuals or from federal firearms dealers, whether in their home state or in another state, and ship C&amp;R firearms in interstate commerce by common carrier. Curios or relics are defined in as &quot;Firearms which are of special interest to collectors by reason of some quality other than is associated with firearms intended for sporting use or as offensive or defensive weapons.&quot; The regulation further states:

==James and Sarah Brady==
James Brady was press secretary to President Ronald Reagan when both he and the president, along with Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy and District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delehanty, were shot on March 30, 1981, during an assassination attempt by John Hinckley Jr. Brady was shot in the head and suffered a serious wound that left him partially paralyzed for life.

John Hinckley Jr. bought the .22 caliber Röhm RG-14 revolver used in the shooting at a Dallas, Texas, pawn shop on October 13, 1980. In a purchase application that he filled out before taking possession of the revolver, he provided a false home address on the form and showed an old Texas driver&#x27;s license as &quot;proof&quot; that he lived there. This constituted a felony offense. Additionally, Hinckley had been arrested four days earlier at the Metropolitan Airport in Nashville, Tennessee, when he attempted to board an American Airlines flight for New York with three handguns and some loose ammunition in his carry-on bag. That same day, President Jimmy Carter was in Nashville and scheduled to travel to New York. Finally, Hinckley had been under psychiatric care prior to his gun purchase.

According to Sarah Brady, had a background check been conducted on Hinckley, it could have detected some, or all, of this important criminal and mental health history.

Sarah Brady, James&#x27;s wife, became active in the gun control movement a few years after the shooting. She joined the Board of Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI) in 1985 and became its chair in 1989. Two years later, she became Chair of the center to Prevent Handgun Violence, HCI&#x27;s 501(c)(3) sister organization. In 2001, the organizations were renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence in honor of James and Sarah.

On February 4, 1987, the Brady Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress for the first time. Sarah Brady and HCI made the passage of the Brady bill, as it was commonly called, their top legislative priority. In a March 1991 editorial, President Reagan opined that the Brady Act would provide a crucial &quot;enforcement mechanism&quot; to end the &quot;honor system&quot; of the 1968 Gun Control Act and &quot;can&#x27;t help but stop thousands of illegal handgun purchases.&quot;

James and Sarah Brady were guests of honor when President Bill Clinton signed the Brady Act into law on November 30, 1993. President Clinton has stated, &quot;If it hadn&#x27;t been for them, we would not have passed the Brady Law.&quot; In December 2000, the Boards of Trustees for HCI and the center to Prevent Handgun Violence voted to honor James and Sarah Brady&#x27;s hard work and commitment to gun control by renaming the two organizations the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

In 2000, controversy arose when Sarah Brady purchased a .30-06 Springfield rifle in Delaware for her son. Gun rights groups claimed that this action was a straw purchase, intended to avoid the NICS, and may have also violated Delaware firearms purchase laws. No charges were ever filed against Sarah Brady, however. A firearm purchased as a gift is not considered a straw purchase under U.S. federal law if the recipient may legally possess it. Critics pointed out, however, that private firearm transfers like the one made by Sarah Brady are a common concern of gun control advocates (although exemptions for family members have been allowed in past legislation to regulate such sales).

== Dissenting views and complaints from the National Rifle Association ==
Though dissenting opinions assert that legislation to limit the prevalence of gun violence is needed, opponents of the Act argue it will have limited impact on the nation&#x27;s issue with violent crime because its provisions do little to stop guns from being obtained illegally, and only deal with firearm sales from registered dealers.

=== National Rifle Association ===
After the Brady Act was originally proposed in 1987, the National Rifle Association (NRA) mobilized to defeat the legislation, spending millions of dollars in the process. While the bill eventually did pass in both chambers of the United States Congress, the NRA was able to win an important concession: the final version of the legislation provided that, in 1998, the five-day waiting period for handgun sales would be replaced by an instant computerized background check that involved no waiting periods.

The NRA then funded lawsuits in Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas, Vermont and Wyoming that sought to strike down the Brady Act as unconstitutional. These cases wound their way through the courts, eventually leading the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Brady Act in the case of &quot;Printz v. United States&quot;.

In &quot;Printz&quot;, the NRA argued that the Brady Act was unconstitutional because its provisions requiring local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks was a violation of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution (Brief Amicus Curiae of the National Rifle Association of America in Support of Petitioners, &quot;Printz v. United States&quot;, 521 U.S. 898, 1997). Based on these grounds, the NRA told the Court &quot;the whole Statute must be voided.&quot;

In its 1997 decision in the case, the Supreme Court ruled that the provision of the Brady Act that compelled state and local law enforcement officials to perform the background checks was unconstitutional on 10th amendment grounds. The Court determined that this provision violated both the concept of federalism and that of the unitary executive. However, the overall Brady statute was upheld and state and local law enforcement officials remained free to conduct background checks if they so chose. The vast majority continued to do so. In 1998, background checks for firearm purchases became mostly a federally run activity when NICS came online, although many states continue to mandate state run background checks before a gun dealer may transfer a firearm to a buyer.

Background checks for firearms purchases operate in only one direction because of the Firearm Owners Protection Act. That is, although a firearms dealer may obtain electronic information that an individual is excluded from firearms purchases, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) do not receive electronic information in return to indicate what firearms are being purchased.

==Since 1998==
From the inception of the NICS system in 1998 through 2014, more than 202 million Brady background checks have been conducted. During this period approximately 1.2 million attempted firearm purchases were blocked by the Brady background check system, or about 0.6 percent. The most common reason for denials are previous felony convictions.

Prosecution and conviction of violators of the Brady Act, however, is extremely rare. During the first 17 months of the Act, only seven individuals were convicted. In the first year of the Act, 250 cases were referred for prosecution and 217 of them were rejected.

A 2000 study in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (&quot;JAMA&quot;) found that the implementation of the Brady Act was associated with &quot;reductions in the firearm suicide rate for persons aged 55 years or older.&quot; While the same study was unable to conclusively demonstrate the Brady Act had an effect on other gun-related deaths, later studies found waiting periods for handguns significantly reduce overall gun deaths. Georgetown University professor Jens Ludwig and Duke University professor Philip J. Cook, who conducted the &quot;JAMA&quot; study, praised the law. However, they also pointed out that it did not regulate a &quot;secondary market&quot; which involved acquiring guns from non-dealers, stating that &quot;Our own view is that the Brady Act was a useful—but modest—first step, reducing the availability of guns to high-risk groups such as teens and convicted felons. The Brady Act&#x27;s apparent effect in reducing gun suicides is encouraging, and implies that lives were probably saved as a result of the waiting period that was required during the first four years of the legislation. But effective action to reduce gun crime may require extending the regulatory umbrella to include the secondary market.&quot; Despite allegations that firearm-related homicides did not greatly decrease by 2000, nationwide data collected by the U.S. Department of Justice showed otherwise, with firearm related homicides dropping from 17,527 in 1994 to 10,801 in 2000. However, other factors played a role as well, as non-gun-related violence declined throughout the period. Researchers continue to debate how much of the decline in violent crime can be attributed to the Brady Act or other gun control legislation.

<text>The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, commonly referred to as the 1994 Crime Bill, or the Clinton Crime Bill, is an Act of Congress dealing with crime and law enforcement; it became law in 1994. It is the largest crime bill in the history of the United States and consisted of 356 pages that provided for 100,000 new police officers, $9.7 billion in funding for prisons which were designed with significant input from experienced police officers. Sponsored by U.S. Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, the bill was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Then-Senator Joe Biden of Delaware drafted the Senate version of the legislation in cooperation with the National Association of Police Organizations, also incorporating the Assault Weapons ban and the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) with Senator Orrin Hatch.

The Violent Crime Prevention and Law Enforcement Act was first conceived by the government in the early 1990s, with Senator Joe Biden, then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, playing a major role in drafting the law. Biden worked closely with law enforcement officials, especially the National Police Officers Association, due to his keenness to reduce crime and impose security and peace in the United States. Biden developed measures aimed at reducing crime by formulating some basic concepts on how to avoid crimes or punish criminals with severe penalties. He also added that when drafting the law, certain strategies should be used to help punish and rehabilitate prisoners. He also said that the National Association of Police Organizations played a major role in drafting the bill by formulating policies that were fully aligned with the priorities of law enforcement agencies across the United States. More deeply, the police, due to their many patrols in areas where crimes are rampant, helped reduce those risks because the police arrested a large percentage of drug dealers, gangs and criminals. The bill initially met with bipartisan criticism as it made its way through Congress. Republicans argued that the bill would provide significant funding for crime prevention programs that purported to be social rehabilitation, while drug treatment programs and youth crime initiatives could cost the state much money but could be ineffective. They argued that punitive measures could be easier and more effective.

Following the 101 California Street shooting, the 1993 Waco Siege, and other high-profile instances of violent crime, the Act expanded federal law in several ways. One of the most noted sections was the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Other parts of the Act provided for a greatly expanded federal death penalty, new classes of individuals banned from possessing firearms, and a variety of new crimes defined in statutes relating to hate crimes, sex crimes, and gang-related crime. The bill also required states to establish registries for sexual offenders by September 1997.

== Legislative history ==

During the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton sought to reposition the Democratic Party, which had previously been attacked as &quot;soft on crime,&quot; as an advocate for &quot;get-tough&quot; policing strategies as well as investing in community policing. Federal funding for additional police and community policing were both priorities of the Democratic Leadership Council, of which Clinton was a member. In an announcement that the &quot;New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a page from the Republican playbook,&quot; Clinton said on July 23, 1992:We cannot take our country back until we take our neighborhoods back. Four years ago this crime issue was used to divide America. I want to use it to unite America. I want to be tough on crime and good for civil rights. You can&#x27;t have civil justice without order and safety.Clinton&#x27;s platform, &quot;Putting People First&quot;, proposed to:Fight crime by putting 100,000 new police officers on the streets. We will create a National Police Corps and offer unemployed veterans and active military personnel a chance to become law enforcement officers at home. We will also expand community policing, fund more drug treatment, and establish community boot camps to discipline first-time non-violent offenders.Liberal Democrats opposed the law because they were very concerned about the mandatory minimum sentences, especially since the law added the three-strikes rule, which meant a life sentence for criminals who were convicted of three violent or drug crimes, pointing out that this would lead to an increase in the prison population, especially in mass prisons, as this would lead to overcrowding. On the other hand, the negative effects that the law produced when it eliminated the Pell grants for prisoners, as this move was met with strong opposition from Democrats, who argued that education is a tool for rehabilitation, and that eliminating these grants would reduce educational opportunities for prisoners, which would reduce their chances of rehabilitation and reintegration into society again after imprisonment.

The law was widely criticized by politicians, pointing out that this law would increase the authority of the Federal government of the United States in matters of local law enforcement, which would have greatly affected marginalized communities, especially African American communities. Despite all the criticism that the law had gone through, it was passed in the House by voice vote on November 3, 1993, and passed in the Senate on November 19th by a vote of 95-4. One of the main reasons that the bill was eventually supported was due to the Congressional Black Caucus after their concerns of rising crime rates in their areas. 

A majority of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for the bill. A Gallup survey in 1994 found that &quot;58% of African Americans supported the crime bill, compared to 49% of white Americans.&quot; However, a 1993 poll from &quot;USA Today&quot;, CNN, and Gallup found that &quot;an overwhelming number of Blacks believed that the criminal justice system treated Blacks more harshly than whites.&quot; Historian Michael Javen Fortner cites high crime rates as a likely cause of Black support of the bill as well as the bill&#x27;s funding of crime prevention and rehabilitation programs. In August 1994, President Clinton worked to increase Democratic support on the bill and met with three Caucus members who had previously opposed the bill, convincing them that the bill was the best it could be.

==Provisions==
The Violent Crime Prevention and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is one of the largest anti-crime bills in the history of the United States, as it includes many provisions whose primary goal is to address crime and add public safety to the community. One of the important provisions included in the anti-crime law is to increase law enforcement through numerous fundings provided by the US government. Through this funding, approximately 100,000 new police officers have been hired nationwide. This is done through a program that offers community-oriented police services. It can be said that this program has expanded police efforts in the community and shaped the relationship between police officers and civilians to work together to eliminate or reduce crime.

The anti-crime law also added a provision to expand the scope of federal crimes and penalties, as it introduced approximately 60 new crimes, indicating that these crimes require the death penalty, including terrorist murders, drug-trafficking, and drive-by shootings, in addition to the three-strikes law.

=== Federal Assault Weapons Ban ===

One of the important aspects of the law that caused much controversy in the United States, especially in the government, is the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which prohibited the manufacture, transfer, and possession of some types of automatic ghost firearms and high-velocity magazines for civilian use. This particular provision was met with great opposition from the police, so a clause was added to this provision to prohibit the circulation of weapons between civilians and persons who are not qualified to carry weapons. The duration of the sentence was 10 years and ended in 2004. The ban took effect September 13, 1994, and expired on September 13, 2004, by a sunset provision. Since the expiration date, there is no federal ban on the subject firearms or magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition.

=== Violence Against Women Act ===

There were a large number of women who were subjected to violence, so the US government added a provision, which is the Violence Against Women Act, as this law provided about 1.6 billion programs aimed at preventing and treating domestic violence and sexual violence that women are exposed to annually. It must be mentioned that this law also added provisions to establish centers for the psychological and physical rehabilitation of women to relieve them of the crises of rape and domestic violence, the main goal of this law is to treat the abuse that women are exposed to. Since the main reason for this law is to combat crimes by arresting criminals, as these strategies that have been taken have led to overcrowding in prisons, this has prompted the government to fund $9.7 billion to build new prisons.

Part of VAWA was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Morrison&quot; (2000).

===Federal Death Penalty Act===
Title VI, the Federal Death Penalty Act, created 60 new death penalty offenses under 41 federal capital statutes, for crimes related to acts of terrorism, non-homicidal narcotics offenses, murder of a federal law enforcement officer, civil rights-related murders, drive-by shootings resulting in death, the use of weapons of mass destruction resulting in death, and carjackings resulting in death.

The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing occurred a few months after this law came into effect, and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 was passed in response, which further increased the federal death penalty. In 2001, Timothy McVeigh was executed for the murder of eight federal law enforcement agents under that title.

The Federal Death Penalty Act was declared unconstitutional in the case of &quot;U.S. v Quinones,&quot; ruling that the Act presented an &quot;undue risk of executing innocent people&quot;. This decision was reversed on appeal, allowing its continued use. However, the death penalty for non-homicidal crimes was abolished nationwide in 2008.

=== Elimination of higher education for inmates===
One of the more controversial provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act overturned a section of the Higher Education Act of 1965 permitting prison inmates to receive a Pell Grant for higher education while they were incarcerated. The amendment is as follows:

The VCCLEA effectively eliminated the ability of lower-income prison inmates to receive college educations during their term of imprisonment, thus ensuring the education level of most inmates remains unimproved over the period of their incarceration.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020, restored the ability of incarcerated students to receive Pell Grants beginning July 1, 2023

===Driver&#x27;s Privacy Protection Act===
Title XXX, the Driver&#x27;s Privacy Protection Act, governs the privacy and disclosure of personal information gathered by the states&#x27; Departments of Motor Vehicles. The law was passed in 1994; it was introduced by Jim Moran in 1992 after an increase in opponents of abortion rights using public driving license databases to track down and harass abortion providers and patients, most notably by both besieging Susan Wicklund&#x27;s home for a month and following her daughter to school.

===Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act===
Under Title XVII, known as the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, guidelines were established for states to track sex offenders. States had also been required to track sex offenders by confirming their place of residence annually for ten years after their release into the community or quarterly for the rest of their lives if the sex offender was convicted of a violent sex crime. The Wetterling Act was later amended in 1996 with Megan&#x27;s Law, which permanently required states to give public disclosure of sex offenders. In 2006, the Wetterling Act&#x27;s state registers was replaced with a federal register through the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.

===Community Oriented Policing Services===
Since 1994, the COPS Office has provided $30 billion in assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies to help hire community policing officers. The COPS Office also funds the research and development of guides, tools and training, and provides technical assistance to police departments implementing community policing principles. The law authorized the COPS Office to hire 100,000 more police officers to patrol the nation&#x27;s streets.

===Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Program===
Title II of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 provided incentive grants to build and expand correctional facilities to qualifying states that enforced mandatory sentencing of 85% of a person&#x27;s sentence conviction. &quot;One purpose of theVOI/TIS incentive grants,&quot; the Bureau reported, &quot;is to enable States to manage prison capacity by providing funds to increase prison beds for violent offenders.&quot;

===Other provisions===
The Act authorized the initiation of &quot;boot camps&quot; for delinquent minors and allocated a substantial amount of money to build new prisons.

Fifty new federal offenses were added, including provisions making membership in gangs a crime. Some argued that these provisions violated the guarantee of freedom of association in the Bill of Rights. The Act did incorporate elements of H.R. 50 &quot;Federal Bureau of Investigation First Amendment Protection Act of 1993&quot; (into §2339A (c)) to prohibit investigations based purely on protected First Amendment activity, but this was effectively removed in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.

The Act also generally prohibits individuals who have been convicted of a felony involving breach of trust from working in the business of insurance, unless they have received written consent from state regulators.

The Act also made drug testing mandatory for those serving on federal supervised release.

As a result of this Act, the Board decided that the Civil Rights Division should primarily control the work of internal affairs of Law Enforcements for possible reasons of bias, and as a precaution, the Internal Affairs member should cooperate with the Civil Rights Division as per the Council&#x27;s resolution.

The Act prohibits &quot;any person acting on behalf of a governmental authority, to engage in a pattern or practice ... that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.&quot; (Title XXI, Subtitle D.) Subtitle D further requires the United States Department of Justice to issue an annual report on &quot;the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers.&quot; Such reports have not been issued, however.

The Act included a three-strikes provision addressing repeat offenders.

The Act expanded the scope of required FBI data to include hate crimes based on disability, and the FBI began collecting data on disability bias crimes on January 1, 1997.

==Legacy and impacts==
The 1994 Crime Bill marked a shift in the politics of crime and policing in the United States. Sociologist and criminologist William R. Kelly states that, &quot;While the longer-term impact of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 was questionable, the political impact was clear—crime control or &#x27;tough on crime&#x27; became a bipartisan issue.&quot;

Bill Clinton has claimed credit for the reduction in crime rates in the 1990s, stating that, &quot;Because of that bill we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and because of that and the background-check law, we had a 46-year low in deaths of people by gun violence.&quot; Crime rates underwent a long period of reduction in beginning in 1991 and declined by 26% during this eight-year period. The primary reasons for this reduction remain a topic of debate. A study by the General Accounting Office found that grant funding from the Community Oriented Policing Services program supported the hiring of an estimated 17,000 additional officers in 2000, its peak year of impact, and increased additional employment by 89,000 officer-years from 1994 to 2001. This was an increase of 3% in the number of sworn officers in the United States. The GAO concluded that the COPS Office potentially had a modest impact in reducing crime, contributing to an approximate 5% reduction in overall crime rates from 1993 to 2001. A published study by criminologists John Worrell and Tomislav Kovandzic alleged that &quot;COPS spending had little to no effect on crime.&quot; The Crime Bill has also become emblematic of a shift towards mass incarceration in the United States, although its contribution to the long-term trend of expanding prisons is debated. The Justice Policy Institute stated in 2008 that &quot;the Clinton Administration&#x27;s &#x27;tough on crime&#x27; policies resulted in the largest increases in federal and state inmate populations of any president in American history&quot;. Jeremy Travis, former director of the National Institute of Justice, described the truth-in-sentencing provisions of the law as a catalyst: &quot;Here&#x27;s the federal government coming in and saying we&#x27;ll give you money if you punish people more severely, and 28 states and the District of Columbia followed the money and enacted stricter sentencing laws for violent offenses.&quot; The Act may have had a minor effect on mass incarceration and prison expansion. In 1998, twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia qualified for that Federal grant program. Thirteen more states adopted truth-in-sentencing law applying to some crimes or with a lower percentage threshold. By 1997, 69% of sentenced violent offenders were in states meeting the 85% &quot;truth-in-sentencing&quot; threshold and over 90% faced at least a 50% threshold. The Bureau of Justice Statistics projected in 1999 that, &quot;As a result of truth-in-sentencing practices, the State prison population is expected to increase through the incarceration of more offenders for longer periods of time,&quot; and found that the State prison population had &quot;increased by 57%&quot; to &quot;a high of 1,075,052 inmates&quot; while the number of people sentenced to prison each year was only up by 17%. However, a GAO report found that federal incentives were &quot;not a factor&quot; in enacting truth in sentencing provisions in 12 of the 27 states that qualified, and &quot;a key factor&quot; in just four.

The 1994 Crime Bill was also just one in a trend of crime-prevention actions taken by the federal government in the latter part of the 20th Century, with significant expansions of prison facilities and incarceration already being seen by the start of Clinton&#x27;s first term in 1992. Other government efforts cited as also contributing to the dramatic increase in prison population across the U.S. include the creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration under President Richard Nixon as part of his worldwide &quot;war on drugs&quot; campaign, and the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 under President Ronald Reagan.

The legal system relied on plea bargains to minimize the increased case load. Jerry Brown and Bill Clinton later expressed regret over the portions of the measure that led to increased prison population like the three strikes provision.

<text>Lynn Rachel Redgrave (8 March 1943 – 2 May 2010) was a British-American actress. She won two Golden Globe Awards during her career.

A member of the Redgrave family of actors, Lynn trained in London before making her theatrical debut in 1962. By the mid-1960s, she had appeared in several films, including &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963) and &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; (1966), which won her a New York Film Critics Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy, as well as earning her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Redgrave made her Broadway debut in 1967 and performed in several stage productions in New York City while making frequent returns to London&#x27;s West End. Redgrave performed with her sister Vanessa in &quot;Three Sisters&quot; in London and in the title role of Baby Jane Hudson in a television production of &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; in 1991.

Redgrave made a return to cinema in the late 1990s, in films such as &quot;Shine&quot; (1996) and &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; (1998), for which she received her second Academy Award nomination and won a Golden Globe Award For Best Supporting Actress. Lynn Redgrave is the only person to have been nominated for all of the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; American entertainment awards (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony, collectively known when all four have been won as &quot;EGOT&quot;) – without winning any of them.

==Early life and theatrical family==
Redgrave was born in Marylebone, London, the youngest child of actors Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson. Her sister is actress Vanessa Redgrave; her brother was actor and political activist Corin Redgrave. She was the aunt of writer/director Carlo Gabriel Nero and of actresses Joely Richardson, Jemma Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and the sister-in-law of director Tony Richardson, actress Kika Markham and Italian actor Franco Nero. Her grandfather was silent screen leading man Roy Redgrave.

Redgrave dropped out early in 1959 from Queensgate School which she had joined to train as a professional show jumper.

==Career==

After training at London&#x27;s Central School of Speech and Drama, Redgrave made her professional debut in a 1962 production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre. Following a tour of &quot;Billy Liar&quot; and repertory work in Dundee, she made her West End debut at the Haymarket, in N. C. Hunter&#x27;s &quot;The Tulip Tree&quot; with Celia Johnson and John Clements.

She was invited to join the National Theatre for its inaugural season at the Old Vic, working with such directors as Laurence Olivier, Franco Zeffirelli and Noël Coward in roles like Rose in &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot;, Barblin in &quot;Andorra&quot;, Jackie in &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, Kattrin in &quot;Mother Courage&quot;, Miss Prue in &quot;Love for Love&quot; and Margaret in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, which kept her busy for the next three years. During that time, she appeared in films such as &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), &quot;Girl with Green Eyes&quot; (1964), &quot;The Deadly Affair&quot; (1966), and the title role in &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; (also 1966, and which featured her mother, Rachel Kempson). For the last of these roles, she gained the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. In 1967, she made her Broadway debut in &quot;Black Comedy&quot; with Michael Crawford and Geraldine Page. London appearances included Michael Frayn&#x27;s &quot;The Two of Us&quot; with Richard Briers at the Garrick, David Hare&#x27;s &quot;Slag&quot; at the Royal Court and &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, directed by Tom Stoppard at Greenwich in 1973.

Redgrave returned to Broadway in 1974, in &quot;My Fat Friend&quot;. There soon followed &quot;Knock Knock&quot; with Charles Durning, &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; (for a Tony nomination) with Ruth Gordon and &quot;Saint Joan&quot;. During the 1985–86 season she appeared with Rex Harrison, Claudette Colbert and Jeremy Brett in &quot;Aren&#x27;t We All?&quot;, and with Mary Tyler Moore in A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Sue&quot;. In 1983, Redgrave played Cleopatra in an American television version of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; opposite Timothy Dalton. She was in &quot;Misalliance&quot; in Chicago with Irene Worth (earning the Sarah Siddons and Joseph Jefferson awards), &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the American Shakespeare Festival, &quot;California Suite&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Les Dames du Jeudi&quot;, &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;. In 1988, she narrated a dramatised television documentary, &quot;Silent Mouse&quot;, which told the story of the creation of the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot;. She starred with Stewart Granger and Ricardo Montalbán in a Hollywood production of &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; in the early winter of 1991.

With her sister Vanessa as Olga, she returned to the London stage playing Masha in &quot;Three Sisters&quot; in 1991 at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, London, and later played the title role in a television production of &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; again with her sister. Highlights of her early film career also include &quot;The National Health&quot;, &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot;, &quot;The Happy Hooker&quot; and &quot;Getting It Right&quot;. In the United States she was seen in such television series as &quot;Teachers Only&quot;, &quot;House Calls&quot;, &quot;Centennial&quot; and &quot;Chicken Soup&quot;. She also starred in BBC productions such as &quot;The Faint-Hearted Feminist&quot;, &quot;A Woman Alone&quot;, &quot;Death of a Son&quot;, &quot;Calling the Shots&quot; and &quot;Fighting Back&quot;. She played Broadway again in &quot;Moon Over Buffalo&quot; (1996) with co-star Robert Goulet and starred in the world premiere of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Notebook of Trigorin&quot;, based on Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;. She won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play for her performance in &quot;Talking Heads&quot;.

Redgrave became well-known in the United States after appearing in the television series &quot;House Calls&quot;, for which she received an Emmy nomination. She was fired from the series after she insisted on bringing her child to rehearsals so as to continue a breastfeeding schedule. A lawsuit ensued but was dismissed a few years later. Following that, she appeared in a long-running series of television commercials for H. J. Heinz Company, then the manufacturer of the weight loss foods for Weight Watchers, a Heinz subsidiary. Her signature line for the ads was &quot;This Is Living, Not Dieting!&quot;. She wrote a book of her life experiences with the same title, which included a selection of Weight Watchers recipes. The autobiographical section later became the basis of her one-woman play &quot;Shakespeare for My Father&quot;.

In 1989, she appeared on Broadway in &quot;Love Letters&quot; with her husband John Clark, and thereafter they performed the play around the country, on one occasion for the jury in the O. J. Simpson case. In 1993, she appeared on Broadway in the one-woman play &quot;Shakespeare for My Father&quot;, which Clark produced and directed. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. In 1993, she was elected president of the Players&#x27; Club.

In 2005, Redgrave appeared at Quinnipiac University and Connecticut College in the play &quot;Sisters of the Garden&quot;, about the sisters Fanny and Rebekka Mendelssohn and Nadia and Lili Boulanger. She was also reported to be writing a one-woman play about her battle with breast cancer and her 2003 mastectomy, based on her book &quot;Journal: A Mother and Daughter&#x27;s Recovery from Breast Cancer&quot; with photos by her daughter Annabel and text by Redgrave herself.

In September 2006, she appeared in &quot;Nightingale&quot;, the U.S. premiere of her new one-woman play based upon her maternal grandmother Beatrice, at Los Angeles&#x27; Mark Taper Forum. She also performed the play in May 2007 at Hartford Stage in Hartford, Connecticut. In 2007, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as Dahlia Hainsworth, the mother of Susan Delfino&#x27;s boyfriend Ian Hainsworth.

In 2009, she was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

===Voice work===
Redgrave narrated approximately 20 audiobooks, including &quot;Prince Caspian: The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; by C. S. Lewis for Harper Audio and &quot;Inkheart&quot; by Cornelia Funke for Listening Library.

==Personal life==
On 2 April 1967, Lynn Redgrave married actor John Clark. Together they had three children. Her marriage to Clark was dissolved in 2000, two years after he revealed that he had had an affair with her personal assistant, and that Lynn&#x27;s supposed grandson was in fact Clark&#x27;s own son by the personal assistant, who had married (and subsequently divorced) Clark and Redgrave&#x27;s son. The divorce proceedings were acrimonious and became front-page news, with Clark alleging that Redgrave had also been unfaithful.

On 5 January 1998, Redgrave became a naturalised citizen of the United States.

Redgrave was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2002 New Year Honours for services to acting and the cinema and to the British community in Los Angeles.

==Death==
Redgrave discussed her health problems associated with bulimia and breast cancer. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 2002, had a mastectomy in January 2003 and underwent chemotherapy. She ultimately died from the cancer at her home in Kent, Connecticut on 2 May 2010, aged 67.

Redgrave&#x27;s funeral was held on 8 May 2010 at the First Congregational Church in Kent. She was interred in St Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Cemetery in the hamlet of Lithgow, New York, where her mother Rachel Kempson and her niece Natasha Richardson are also interred.

In 2012, the Folger Shakespeare Library acquired Redgrave&#x27;s collection of personal papers and photographs.

==Legacy==
In 2001, Lynn Redgrave received a LIVING LEGEND honor at The WINFemme Film Festival and The Women&#x27;s Network Image Awards.

In 2013, the Bleecker Street Theater (Off-Broadway) was renamed the Lynn Redgrave Theater.

<doc id="214331" wikidata="Q1857733" url="?curid=214331" title="Morgan – A Suitable Case for Treatment">
<text>Morgan – A Suitable Case for Treatment (also called Morgan!) is a 1966 British comedy film directed by Karel Reisz and starring David Warner, Vanessa Redgrave, and Robert Stephens, with Irene Handl and Bernard Bresslaw. It was made by British Lion and produced by Leon Clore from a screenplay by David Mercer, adapted from his BBC television play &quot;A Suitable Case for Treatment&quot; (1962), in which the leading role was played by Ian Hendry. A film poster for the film is prominently shown in &quot;High-Rise&quot; (2015) .

==Plot==
Morgan Delt is a failed working-class London artist, who was raised as a communist by his parents. His upper-class wife, Leonie, has given up on him and is in the process of getting a divorce in order to marry Charles Napier, an art gallery owner of her own social standing. Locked into a personal world of fantasy, Morgan performs a series of bizarre stunts in a campaign to win back Leonie, including putting a skeleton in her bed and blowing up the bed as her mother sits on it. When these stunts fail, Morgan secures the help of Wally &quot;The Gorilla&quot;, a pro wrestler friend of his mother, to kidnap Leonie, who still nurtures residual feelings of love tinged with pity for Morgan. Leonie is left with Morgan and Wally in the British countryside (clips from &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1943) are cut into the film). Leonie soon gets rescued, and Morgan is arrested and imprisoned.

After escaping, he dresses as a gorilla and crashes the wedding reception of Leonie and Charles. (Clips from &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) are used to illustrate Morgan&#x27;s fantasy world). Morgan flees the wedding on a motorcycle, his gorilla suit on fire, and subsequently is committed to an insane asylum. Later a visibly pregnant Leonie visits him. With a wink, Leonie tells him he is the child&#x27;s father. Morgan returns to tending a flowerbed, as the camera pulls out to a longshot of the entire circular flowerbed with the enclosed flowers arranged into a hammer and sickle.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 3/5 stars, writing: &quot;Angry young men were abundant in the British cinema of the 1960s, but they were never so irate as working-class artist David Warner, who tries to sabotage the second marriage of his middle-class ex-wife Vanessa Redgrave to art dealer Robert Stephens by rewiring their house and dressing in a gorilla suit. Adapted from David Mercer&#x27;s television play, it&#x27;s really a fable about the class society. Yet its dream sequences and surreal touches make it more odd than meaningful, and it now feels dated.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Archetypal sixties marital fantasy, an extension of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; [1959] in the mood of swinging London. As tiresome as it is funny – but it &quot;is&quot; funny.&quot;

== Accolades ==
The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Vanessa Redgrave) and Best Costume Design, Black-and-White (Jocelyn Rickards). It was also nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or (Golden Palm) at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival and Redgrave was awarded Best Actress.

<doc id="214334" wikidata="Q5290177" url="?curid=214334" title="Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban">
<text>The Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban, often called the &quot;Lautenberg Amendment&quot; (&quot;Gun Ban for Individuals Convicted of a Misdemeanor Crime of Domestic Violence&quot;, , ), is an amendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, enacted by the 104th United States Congress in 1996, which bans access to firearms for life by people convicted of crimes of domestic violence. The act is often referred to as &quot;the Lautenberg Amendment&quot; after its sponsor, Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ). Lautenberg proposed the amendment after a decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, involving underenforcement of domestic violence laws brought under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. President Bill Clinton signed the law as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1997.

==Summary==
The act bans shipment, transport, possession, ownership, and use of guns or ammunition by individuals convicted of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. The 1968 Gun Control Act and subsequent amendments had previously prohibited anyone convicted of a felony and anyone subject to a domestic violence protective order from possessing a firearm. The act also makes it unlawful to knowingly sell or give a firearm or ammunition to such persons.

The definition of &#x27;convicted&#x27; can be found in and has exceptions:

:(i) A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of such an offense for purposes of this chapter, unless—
::(I) the person was represented by counsel in the case, or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel in the case; and
::(II) in the case of a prosecution for an offense described in this paragraph for which a person was entitled to a jury trial in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried, either
:::(aa) the case was tried by a jury, or
:::(bb) the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury, by guilty plea or otherwise.
:(ii) A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of such an offense for purposes of this chapter if the conviction has been expunged or set aside, or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored (if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense) unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.

==Restraining order restrictions (preceded the Lautenberg Amendment)==

The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 included a provision restricting respondents to final protective orders from possessing, receiving, transporting, or shipping firearms or ammunition. For restrictions arising from a restraining order there are several requirements before the restrictions apply as follows:

The hearing requirement ensures that the firearms restrictions will not apply after an initial ex parte hearing during which a temporary order is granted, but only after a longer term order is granted following a hearing in which both parties have the opportunity to be heard. The intimate partner requirement says that the relationship must be both sexual and involve cohabitation or a child in common. A Brady indicator trigger is generated when the requirements apply, resulting in the restraining order being noted in a federal database as prohibiting the possession of firearms. However, the state forms used for restraining orders do not always clearly indicate whether the specific federal criteria apply, making it difficult to determine whether the firearms restriction applies without a detailed reading of the order, the petition, and other court records.

==Court history==
This law has been tested but supported in federal court with the case &quot;United States v. Emerson&quot; (No. 99-10331) (5th Cir. 2001). See also U.S. v. Emerson, 231 Fed. Appx. 349 (5th Cir. 2007) (Same defendant seeking review of judgment). The case involved a challenge to the Constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8)(C)(ii), a federal statute that prohibited the transportation of firearms or ammunition in interstate commerce by persons subject to a court order that, by its explicit terms, prohibits the use of physical force against an intimate partner or child. &quot;Emerson&quot; does not address the portion of the Lautenberg Amendment involving conviction for misdemeanor domestic violence. It was initially overturned in 1999 for being unconstitutional, but that case was reversed upon appeal in 2001.

The case &quot;Gillespie v. City of Indianapolis, Indiana&quot;, 185 F.3d 693 (7th Cir. 1999) also challenged this law, and the case was rejected.
The &quot;ex post facto&quot; aspects of the law were challenged with:
* &quot;United States v. Brady&quot;, 26 F.3d 282 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 246 (1994) (denying &quot;ex post facto&quot; challenge to a 922(g)(1) conviction) and
* &quot;United States v. Waters&quot;, 23 F.3d 29 (2nd Cir. 1994) (&quot;ex post facto&quot; based challenge to a 922(g)(4) conviction).

Both of the challenges were denied.

Likewise this law was invoked in &quot;United States v. Jardee&quot; where it was ruled that the threat of being subjected to the gun ban did not turn an otherwise &quot;petty&quot; crime into a &quot;serious&quot; one requiring a jury trial.

In &quot;United States vs Chovan&quot; (2013), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Lautenberg amendment is constitutional. Chovan claimed that his civil rights had been restored due to California law, but according to federal law, his rights had never been restored. The court also stated that a person cannot have their civil rights restored if they were never taken away in the first place since the Lautenberg amendment does not take away a person’s right to vote or be on a jury.

In &quot;United States v. Hayes&quot; (2009), the Supreme Court held that the predicate offense does not need to include a domestic relationship as an element, so long as a domestic relationship did in fact exist between the perpetrator and the victim. &quot;United States v. Castleman&quot; (2014) challenged the application of the law to misdemeanor convictions which did not involve &quot;the use or attempted use of physical force&quot;. In a 9–0 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that Castleman&#x27;s conviction of &quot;misdemeanor domestic assault&quot; did qualify as a &quot;misdemeanor crime of domestic violence&quot; under Tennessee state law. Specifically holding that the &quot;&quot;physical force&quot; requirement is satisfied by the degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction — namely, offensive touching&quot;, thereby preventing him from possession of firearms. Most recently, the Supreme Court in &quot;Voisine v. United States&quot;, 579 U.S. ___ (2016), decided that the Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban in U.S. federal law extends to those convicted of reckless domestic violence.

In 2022 President Joe Biden signed into effect the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. It narrowed the boyfriend loophole because it makes the Lautenberg Amendment apply to people in a significant dating relationship.

<doc id="214337" wikidata="Q7250389" url="?curid=214337" title="Proposed flags of Taiwan">
<text>Several proposals for a flag of Taiwan have been initiated by supporters of the Taiwan independence movement to replace the flag of the Republic of China as the national flag flown over Taiwan. Supporters of the movement object to the use of the flag of the Republic of China since it was designed by and is closely associated with the Kuomintang. However, no single flag has been established as the symbol of the independence movement, and supporters of Taiwanese independence, such as the Democratic Progressive Party, have accepted the flag of the Republic of China for the time being and have not pushed for a new flag. The flag of the Republic of China in current use is defined in the 6th article of the Constitution, and amending the Constitution requires a referendum which would only succeed with wide political support. The Republic of China, originally based in mainland China, retreated to Taiwan in 1949 and established its capital in Taipei. The region, now commonly referred to as &quot;Taiwan&quot; in vernacular, retains its official name &quot;Republic of China&quot; and still officially claims territories governed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, just as the PRC claims all ROC territories.

==Prominent proposals==
From the mid-1950s to the 1970s, a self-proclaimed Republic of Taiwan Provisional Government was active in Japan. Its president was Thomas Liao, who was in exile there. This government used a flag of a blue field charged with a white sun and a white crescent moon.

In 1994, a campaign called “New Name, New Flag, New Anthem” was launched to rename the Republic of China, replace the flag of the Republic of China and the National Anthem of the Republic of China, all of which were officially used in Taiwan since 1945. After a contest in which 187 different flags were entered, the “hearts-in-harmony flag” emerged as the winner. The green field was to symbolize the natural beauty of the island and the need to protect the environment; the white in the Canadian pale was to symbolize the purity of the people on the island and the desire to preserve the natural beauty; and the device in the centre was to symbolize four hearts in harmony, representing the four population groups on the island: the indigenous peoples, Hakka, Hoklo, and mainlanders. This flag has emerged as the most well-known proposed flag of Taiwan, though it has not gained acceptance with the mainstream Democratic Progressive Party. Some Chinese nationalists criticized the design as being reminiscent of the Imperial Seal of Japan where a chrysanthemum is present. By extension, the design can be seen as an endorsement of historical Japanese colonial influence on Formosa/Taiwan.

In September 2013, the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign held a ceremony in front of the Presidential Office Building in Taipei, raising a flag for Taiwan that had been proposed by the World Taiwanese Congress. This flag has a green field and a green map of Taiwan with its associated islands (excluding Kinmen and Matsu) in a Canadian pale.

Earlier in 2005, the same 908 Campaign had raised instead its own banner at the same place, in front of a crowd of about 500 (mostly Taiwan Solidarity Union supporters) on 8 September 2005 – a date it proclaimed &quot;Taiwan&#x27;s Independence Day&quot; to mark the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952 in which Japan relinquished its claim to Taiwan. This banner, which had been featured in smaller rallies elsewhere in Taiwan, featured three horizontal stripes in blue, white, and green transitioning in color gradients and a red circle in the middle along with the characters &quot;State of Taiwan&quot; (). The banner was meant to symbolize history of Taiwan: the red circle to represent Japan, the blue to represent the KMT, and green to represent the DPP. It was unique, as other flag proposals avoid the color blue altogether.

In 2016, Taiwan independence proponent Chih-Hao Chen designed the Flag of Taiwan the Formosa (“台灣翠青” or “Taiwan the Green” in Chinese language, inspired by the poem and hymn of the same name), which has since been adopted by supporters of the Taiwan independence movement as a symbol of Taiwan independence ideology and Taiwanese identity. Despite its colonial roots, Chen admitted his fondness of the Seal of the Government-General of Taiwan, for its meaning (the “Tai” in “Taiwan” in both Chinese and Japanese writing) and its geometrical resemblance of the impression of an island (two triangles in mirror images), and therefore introduced the seal into the flag&#x27;s design. The flag adopts an aspect ratio of 1:1.5. The stacked green triangle and white triangle represent the layers of mountain ranges as the island would be viewed from ships sailing on nearby seas, with tree-clad mountains in the foreground and snow-covered mountains in the background. Switching to bird&#x27;s-eye view, one could see Taiwan (as symbolized by the seal) advancing forward in the ocean and stirring up white waves, indicating Taiwanese people&#x27;s determination to pursue its independence. On selecting the flag colors, deep blue in the background represents the ocean; white represents waves of immigrants with diversified cultural backgrounds at different periods throughout the history of Taiwan, migrating and assimilating into the Taiwanese society; and the bright green (Pantone 3255C) represents the first dwellers of the island – the Taiwanese indigenous peoples.

==Prospects==
While there have been some debates about replacing the ROC flag, the likelihood of doing so is not high given that it requires a constitutional amendment, which needs wide bipartisan support and a referendum under the conditions of the article 12 of the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China:
Amendment of the Constitution shall be initiated upon the proposal of one-fourth of the total members of the Legislative Yuan, passed by at least three-fourths of the members present at a meeting attended by at least three-fourths of the total members of the Legislative Yuan, and sanctioned by electors in the free area of the Republic of China at a referendum held upon expiration of a six-month period of public announcement of the proposal, wherein the number of valid votes in favor exceeds one-half of the total number of electors. The provisions of Article 174 of the Constitution [the previous method of amendment, via the National Assembly of the Republic of China] shall not apply.

The present flag has a huge amount of support among Pan-Blue Coalition supporters as the symbol of a Chinese democracy and even acquiescence by some independence supporters for various other reasons. On the other hand, some supporters of Taiwan Independence seek the flag change as part of a larger change to replace the Constitution of Republic of China that has been effective in Taiwan since 1945.

While green has emerged as the color of Taiwan independence and can be seen ubiquitously in pro-independence rallies, at the moment, no one flag has achieved consensus among the various groups. Unlike other political movements, those in Taiwan do not feel there is a historical or local flag suitable for use as a symbol. The flag of the short-lived Republic of Formosa is considered to be unsuitable by some, since that republic was declared by Chinese loyalists and designed as a tributary state in a failed attempt to avert Japanese colonization in 1895. The present national flag, the flag of the Republic of China, is seen by others as a symbol of Chinese nationalism.

At rallies of the Pan-Green Coalition, green campaign banners and party flags are common while the national flag is rarely displayed, but the various proposed flags are never seen in unison. A dilemma arose when Lee Teng-hui was scheduled to speak at the National Press Club in Washington, DC in 2005: while National Press Club conventions would have called the ROC flag to be flown to reflect the nationality of the speaker, pro-independence groups objected to using the flag of the Republic of China. However, the National Press Club&#x27;s only other alternative, a Democratic Progressive Party flag, would have been inappropriate anyway as Lee was not a DPP member.

==In popular culture==
The hearts-in-harmony flag was a prominent part of the plot in the episode &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; of the TV series &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

The hearts-in-harmony flag was used to illustrate the entry for Taiwan in a World Factfile supplement of the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 25 April 2009. The entry also omitted using the name &quot;Republic of China&quot;.

In the Taiwanese TV series &quot;Island Nation 2&quot;, there is a scene based on the real event when former WUFI chair , wearing a T-shirt decorated with the hearts-in-harmony flag, challenged President Lee Teng-hui during his lecture at Cornell University in 1995.

<text>Pavo is a constellation in the southern sky whose name is Latin for . Pavo first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer&#x27;s star atlas &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603, and was likely conceived by Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille gave its stars Bayer designations in 1756. The constellations Pavo, Grus, Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.

The constellation&#x27;s brightest member, Alpha Pavonis, is also known as Peacock and appears as a 1.91-magnitude blue-white star, but is actually a spectroscopic binary. Delta Pavonis is a nearby Sun-like star some 19.9 light-years distant. Six of the star systems in Pavo have been found to host planets, including HD 181433 with a super-Earth, and HD 172555 with evidence of a major interplanetary collision in the past few thousand years. The constellation contains NGC 6752, the fourth-brightest globular cluster in the sky, and the spiral galaxy NGC 6744, which closely resembles the Milky Way but is twice as large. Pavo displays an annual meteor shower known as the Delta Pavonids, whose radiant is near the star δ Pav.

==History and mythology==

===History of the modern constellation===

Pavo was one of the twelve constellations established by Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the &quot;Eerste Schipvaart&quot;, to the East Indies. It first appeared on a 35 cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in German cartographer Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name &quot;De Pauww&quot; . Pavo and the nearby constellations Phoenix, Grus, and Tucana are collectively called the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.

===The peacock in Greek mythology===
According to Mark Chartrand, former executive director of the National Space Institute, Plancius may not have been the first to designate this group of stars as a peacock: &quot;In Greek myth the stars that are now the Peacock were Argos [or Argus], builder of the ship Argo. He was changed by the goddess Juno into a peacock and placed in the sky along with his ship.&quot; Indeed, the peacock &quot;symboliz[ed] the starry firmament&quot; for the Greeks, and the goddess Hera was believed to drive through the heavens in a chariot drawn by peacocks.

The peacock and the &quot;Argus&quot; nomenclature are also prominent in a different myth, in which Io, a beautiful princess of Argos, was lusted after by Zeus (Jupiter). Zeus changed Io into a heifer to deceive his wife (and sister) Hera and couple with her. Hera saw through Zeus&#x27;s scheme and asked for the heifer as a gift. Zeus, unable to refuse such a reasonable request, reluctantly gave the heifer to Hera, who promptly banished Io and arranged for Argus Panoptes, a creature with one hundred eyes, to guard the now-pregnant Io from Zeus. Meanwhile, Zeus entreated Hermes to save Io; Hermes used music to lull Argus Panoptes to sleep, then slew him. Hera adorned the tail of a peacock—her favorite bird—with Argus&#x27;s eyes in his honor.

As recounted in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, the death of Argus Panoptes also contains an explicit celestial reference: &quot;Argus lay dead; so many eyes, so bright quenched, and all hundred shrouded in one night. Saturnia [Hera] retrieved those eyes to set in place among the feathers of her bird [the peacock, Pavo] and filled his tail with starry jewels.&quot;
It is uncertain whether the Dutch astronomers had the Greek mythos in mind when creating Pavo but, in keeping with other constellations introduced by Plancius through Keyser and De Houtmann, the &quot;peacock&quot; in the new constellation likely referred to the green peacock, which the explorers would have encountered in the East Indies, rather than the blue peacock known to the ancient Greeks.
Another possible inspiration for the name Pavo may be from the major financial supporter of the dutch missions, who was Reynier Pauw (Pauw means Pavo/peacock in Dutch). Despite the fact Reynier Pauw does not have any streetname nor school named after him, this fact would honor his contribution to the Dutch history in a brilliant way.

===Equivalents in other cultures===
The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia saw the stars of Pavo and the neighbouring constellation Ara as flying foxes.

==Characteristics==
Pavo is bordered by Telescopium to the north, Apus and Ara to the west, Octans to the south, and Indus to the east and northeast. Covering 378 square degrees, it ranks 44th of the 88 modern constellations in size and covers 0.916% of the night sky. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Pav&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −56.59° and −74.98°. As one of the deep southern constellations, it remains below the horizon at latitudes north of the 30th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and is circumpolar at latitudes south of the 50th parallel in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Features==

===Stars===
Although he depicted Pavo on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Omega in 1756, but omitted Psi and Xi, and labelled two pairs of stars close together Mu and Phi Pavonis. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Pavonis as he felt its brightness warranted a name, but dropped Chi Pavonis due to its faintness.

Lying near the constellation&#x27;s northern border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, the brightest star in Pavo. Its proper name—Peacock—is an English translation of the constellation&#x27;s name. It was assigned by the British HM Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an apparent (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light years away from Earth.

With an apparent magnitude of 3.43, Beta Pavonis is the second-brightest star in the constellation. A white giant of spectral class A7III, it is an aging star that has used up the hydrogen fuel at its core and has expanded and cooled after moving off the main sequence. It lies 135 light years away from the Solar System.

Lying a few degrees west of Beta is Delta Pavonis, a nearby Sun-like but more evolved star; this is a yellow subgiant of spectral type G8IV and apparent magnitude 3.56 that is only 19.9 light years distant from Earth. East of Beta and at the constellation&#x27;s eastern border with Indus is Gamma Pavonis, a fainter, solar-type star 30 light years from Earth with a magnitude of 4.22 and stellar class F9V. Other nearby stars in Pavo are much fainter: SCR 1845-6357 (the nearest star in Pavo) is a binary system with an apparent magnitude of 17.4 consisting of a red dwarf and brown dwarf companion lying around 12.6 light years distant, while Gliese 693 is a red dwarf of magnitude 10.78 lying 19 light years away.

Pavo contains several variable stars of note. Lambda Pavonis is a bright irregular variable ranging between magnitudes 3.4 and 4.4; this variation can be observed with the unaided eye. Classed as a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable or shell star, it is of spectral type B2II-IIIe and lies around 1430 light years distant from Earth. Kappa Pavonis is a W Virginis variable—a subclass of Type II Cepheid. It ranges from magnitude 3.91 to 4.78 over 9 days and is a yellow-white supergiant pulsating between spectral classes F5I-II and G5I-II. NU and V Pavonis are pulsating semiregular variable red giant stars. NU has a spectral type M6III and ranges from magnitude 4.9 to 5.3, while V Pavonis ranges from magnitude 6.3 to 8.2 over two periods of 225.4 and 3735 days concurrently. V is a carbon star of spectral type C6,4(Nb) with a prominent red hue.

Located in the west of the constellation and depicting the peacock&#x27;s tail are Eta and Xi Pavonis. At apparent magnitude 3.6, Eta is a luminous orange giant of spectral type K2II some 350 light years distant from Earth. Xi Pavonis is a multiple star system visible in small telescopes as a brighter orange star and fainter white companion. Located around 470 light years from Earth, the system has a magnitude of 4.38. AR Pavonis is a faint but well-studied eclipsing binary composed of a red giant and smaller hotter star some 18000 light years from Earth. It has some features of a cataclysmic variable, the smaller component most likely having an accretion disc. The visual magnitude ranges from 7.4 to 13.6 over 605 days.

In November 2018, the 8th magnitude star, HD 186302 became the second star identified to be a solar sibling, this one being particularly sun like, same spectra G2, virtually the same mass as well, with a twin spectra revealing identical metallicity.

===Planetary systems and debris disks===
Six stars with planetary systems have been found. Three planets have been discovered in the system of the orange star HD 181433, an inner super-Earth with an orbital period of 9.4 days and two outer gas giants with periods of 2.6 and 6 years respectively. HD 196050 and HD 175167 are yellow G-class Sun-like stars, while HD 190984 is an F-class main sequence star slightly larger and hotter than the Sun; all three are accompanied by a gas giant companion. HD 172555 is a young white A-type main sequence star, two planets of which appear to have had a major collision in the past few thousand years. Spectrographic evidence of large amounts of silicon dioxide gas indicates the smaller of the two, which had been at least the size of Earth&#x27;s moon, was destroyed, and the larger, which was at least the size of Mercury, was severely damaged. Evidence of the collision was detected by NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope. In the south of the constellation, Epsilon Pavonis is a 3.95-magnitude white main sequence star of spectral type A0Va located around 105 light years distant from Earth. It appears to be surrounded by a narrow ring of dust at a distance of 107 AU.

===Deep-sky objects===

The deep-sky objects in Pavo include NGC 6752, the fourth-brightest globular cluster in the sky, after Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae and Messier 22. An estimated 100 light years across, it is thought to contain 100,000 stars. Barely visible behind the cluster is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy known as Bedin I. Lying three degrees to the south is NGC 6744, a spiral galaxy around 30 million light years away from Earth that resembles the Milky Way, but is twice its diameter. A type 1c supernova was discovered in the galaxy in 2005; known as SN2005at, it peaked at magnitude 16.8. The dwarf galaxy IC 4662 lies 10 arcminutes northeast of Eta Pavonis, and is of magnitude 11.62. Located only 8 million light years away, it has several regions of high star formation. The 14th-magnitude galaxy IC 4965 lies 1.7 degrees west of Alpha Pavonis, and is a central member of the Shapley Supercluster. The galactic wind bearing NGC 6810 and the interacting NGC 6872/IC 4970 galaxies lie 87 and 212 million light-years away from Earth respectively.

===Meteor showers===
Pavo is the radiant of two annual meteor showers: the Delta Pavonids and August Pavonids. Appearing from 21 March to 8 April and generally peaking around 5 and 6 April, Delta Pavonids are thought to be associated with comet Grigg-Mellish. The shower was discovered by Michael Buhagiar from Perth, Australia, who observed meteors on six occasions between 1969 and 1980. The August Pavonids peak around 31 August and are thought to be associated with the Halley-type Comet Levy (P/1991 L3).

<text>André Bessette, C.S.C. (born Alfred; 9 August 1845 – 6 January 1937), commonly known as Brother André () and since his canonization as Saint André of Montreal, was a lay brother of the Congregation of Holy Cross and a significant figure of the Catholic Church among French-Canadians. He is credited with thousands of reported healings associated with his pious devotion to Saint Joseph.

Bessette was declared venerable in 1978 and was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1982. Pope Benedict XVI approved the decree of sainthood for Bessette on 19 February 2010, with the formal canonization taking place on 17 October 2010. He is the first Canadian living after Confederation to be canonized.

==Early life==
He was born Alfred Bessette in Mont-Saint-Grégoire, Canada East (Québec), a small town situated southeast of Montreal. His father, Isaac Bessette, was a carpenter and lumberman, while his mother, Clothilde Foisy Bessette, saw to the education of the children. Bessette was the eighth of 12 children, four of whom died in infancy. At birth, Bessette was so frail that the curé baptized him &quot;conditionally&quot; in an emergency ritual the following day. In 1849, with employment scarce and his family living in poverty, Bessette&#x27;s father moved to Farnham, Quebec to work as a lumberman, but was shortly thereafter killed by a falling tree. Bessette was nine years old, and his mother, at 40, remained with ten children in her care. Clothilde died of tuberculosis within three years, and Bessette became orphaned at the age of twelve.

Following his mother&#x27;s death&quot;,&quot; Bessette was placed under the care of Timothée and Rosalie Nadeau of Saint-Césaire, Quebec. While with the Nadeau family, Bessette attended catechetical lessons taught by his parish&#x27;s pastor, André Provençal. It was during these lessons that Bessette developed his two lifelong devotions: Saint Joseph and the Passion of Christ. In June 1858, at age 12, Bessette was confirmed by Bishop Jean-Charles Prince of the Diocese of Saint-Hyacinthe. When Bessette was 14, the Nadeaus sent him to school. However, Bessette was soon removed from school, having only learned to read and sign his name, both with difficulty. Timothée Nadeau intended to train Bessette as a labourer, seeing no need for an orphan to be educated. Bessette soon left the Nadeaus and was brought in by Louis Ouimet, the mayor of Saint-Césaire. While living with the Ouimet family, Bessette had a series of short-lived occupations, working as a farmer, tinsmith, blacksmith, wheelwright, cobbler, and baker, all of which Bessette was too physically weak to sustain. Searching for work, Bessette moved to Moosup, Connecticut at the age of 18, where he joined several of his relatives in work at textile mills across Connecticut and Rhode Island. Bessette returned to Canada in 1867 following the Canadian Confederation.

==Call to devotion==

The pastor of his parish, André Provençal, noticed the devotion and generosity of the young man. He decided to present Bessette to the Congregation of Holy Cross in Montreal, writing a note to the superior, &quot;I&#x27;m sending you a saint.&quot; Although he was initially rejected by the order because of frail health, Archbishop Ignace Bourget of Montreal intervened on his behalf, and in 1872, Bessette was accepted and entered the novitiate of the congregation, receiving the religious name of Brother André, by which he was known for the rest of his life. He made his final vows on February 2, 1874, at the age of 28. After, Bessette became a porter at Collège Notre-Dame in Côte-des-Neiges, Quebec&quot;,&quot; and also served as sacristan, laundry worker and messenger&quot;.&quot;

While working at the college, Bessette began to minister to the sick. Biographer Leonard Foley wrote that &quot;his great confidence in Saint Joseph inspired him to recommend the saint&#x27;s devotion to all those who were afflicted&quot;.&quot;&quot; The brother also rubbed the sick with oil taken from one of the college&#x27;s lamps. People claimed that they had been cured through the prayers of Bessette and Saint Joseph, and they were grateful their prayers had been heard. Bessette steadfastly refused to take any credit for these cures, even during an epidemic. Bessette&#x27;s desire to see Saint Joseph honoured led him in 1904 to launch a campaign to build a chapel for that purpose.

As tensions increased at the college with so many of the sick coming to see the porter, the school officials decided that Bessette could no longer continue with his ministry. He was permitted to receive the sick in the nearby tramway station rather than the college. As his reputation spread, Bessette became quite a controversial figure. There were many religious in the Congregation of Holy Cross, teachers and parents of students at the College who supported him but many others opposed him and even considered him dangerous to the well-being of the school&#x27;s reputation because they regarded him as a charlatan. Others were concerned for the good health of the children, fearing the possibility of contagion in the school spread from diseases carried by the sick who frequented Bessette.

In 1924 construction of a basilica named Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory began on the side of the mountain, near Bessette&#x27;s chapel.

==Death and path to canonization==

Bessette died on January 6, 1937, at the age of 91. One million people filed past his coffin.

The remains of Bessette lie in the church he helped build. His body lies in a tomb built below the Oratory&#x27;s Main Chapel, except for his heart, which is preserved in a reliquary in the same Oratory. The heart was stolen in March 1973, but was recovered in December 1974 with the help of criminal lawyer Frank Shoofey.

A cause for Bessette&#x27;s beatification was opened on July 20, 1950. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II on May 23, 1982. The miracle cited in support of his beatification was the healing in 1958 of Giuseppe Carlo Audino, who suffered from cancer. 
Saint André is commemorated in most of the world by an optional memorial on January 6. His memorial is celebrated in Canada on January 7.

On December 19, 2009, Pope Benedict XVI promulgated a decree recognizing a second miracle at Bessette&#x27;s intercession, and on October 17, 2010, formally declared sainthood for him. Bessette was the first saint of the Congregation of Holy Cross, the same religious order that founded the University of Notre Dame.

==Legacy==

Many educational buildings were later named for Bessette, including:
* Andre Hall at St. Edward&#x27;s University in Austin, Texas 
*Brother André Catholic High School in Markham, Ontario
*Saint Andre Bessette Secondary School in London, Ontario 
*Saint André Catholic Elementary School in Brampton, Ontario
*St. André Bessette Catholic High School in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta
*St. André French Immersion Catholic Elementary School in Tecumseh, Ontario

Other educational namesakes include the St. Andre Scholars program at Notre Dame College Prep in Niles, Illinois. Statues of Bessette stand at Holy Cross College and the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.

Several churches have also been named for Bessette, including ones in Ecorse, Michigan, Laconia, New Hampshire, Portland, Oregon, Vaughan, Ontario, and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania (now closed). There are also missions named for him in Cadiz, Philippines, Phoenix, Arizona, and York Region, Ontario.

<doc id="214343" wikidata="Q540544" url="?curid=214343" title="Bob Barr">
<text>Robert Laurence Barr Jr. (born November 5, 1948) is an American attorney and politician who has been the current president of the National Rifle Association since 2024. He previously served as a federal prosecutor and as a U.S. Representative, representing Georgia&#x27;s 7th congressional district as a Republican from 1995 to 2003. Barr attained national prominence as one of the leaders of the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. During his time in the House of Representatives, he authored the Defense of Marriage Act, which was later overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013 and repealed by the 117th Congress.

Barr joined the Libertarian Party in 2006&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans2006/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and served on its National Committee. He was the Libertarian Party&#x27;s nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election. Barr announced his return to the Republican party in December 2011. He lost a subsequent bid in 2014 for a Congressional seat.

He was named president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) in May 2024.

==Early life==
Barr was born in Iowa City, Iowa, to Robert Laurence Barr and Beatrice Barr. His father, a career military officer who had graduated from West Point, was stationed in various locations around the world while pursuing his career in civil engineering.

The second of six children, Bob Jr. lived as a boy in Malaysia, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Baghdad, and finally Tehran, Iran, where he graduated from Community High School in 1966.

He returned to the United States for college, attending the University of Southern California. There he joined the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity in 1967. He was elected to the position of Grand Prytanis on the fraternity&#x27;s Grand Council, serving from 2013 to 2015.

During college, Barr&#x27;s mother introduced him to the work of writer Ayn Rand. This fostered a newfound appreciation for conservatism and prompted Barr to join the Young Trojan Republican Club. He completed his B.A., &quot;cum laude&quot;, from the University of Southern California (USC) in 1970. He married his first wife while still in college. They divorced in 1976.

===Early career===
Barr continued in graduate school, earning a master&#x27;s degree in International Affairs from George Washington University&#x27;s Elliott School of International Affairs in 1972. He next earned his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center (attending at night) in 1977. From 1971 to 1978, Barr worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as an analyst of Latin American issues.

Barr married his second wife, Gail, in 1976. They have two children. Gail and Bob Barr divorced in 1986.

After leaving the CIA, Barr moved to northern Georgia. He practiced law and became active in the Republican Party, serving as county chair. Barr made an unsuccessful bid for the Georgia House of Representatives in 1984.

In 1986 Barr married his third wife, Jerilyn Dobbins, who was later known as Jeri Barr. Barr&#x27;s website stated in 2008 that he and Jeri have four children and six grandchildren.

In 1986, Barr was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia – a post Barr held until 1990. His office prosecuted state and local officials, members of the Medellin drug cartel, and got a perjury indictment on then-sitting Republican Congressman Pat Swindall, who ultimately served a year in prison on the charges. From 1990 to 1991, Barr was president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation., an Atlanta-based law firm and policy center that litigates in support of &quot;limited government, individual economic freedom, and the free enterprise system&quot;.

==Congressional career==


Barr sought the Republican Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 1992, but lost the primary election to Paul Coverdell. The primary was very close, with Barr losing by fewer than 1,600 votes in a runoff election. Subsequently, Coverdell came in behind incumbent Senator Wyche Fowler in the general election, but the 3% showing by a Libertarian candidate (Jim Hudson) forced a runoff, which Coverdell won.

Barr was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 as a Republican, upsetting six-term Democrat Buddy Darden, to represent Georgia&#x27;s 7th congressional district in the 104th United States Congress. Barr was one of 73 Republican freshmen ushered into Congress in that election. The election became known as the &quot;Republican Revolution&quot; because it resulted in the first Republican House majority in 40 years – since the 1955 adjournment of the 83rd Congress.

After a Federal Election Commission audit of his 1994 and 1996 campaigns, Barr paid a $28,000 fine for illegal campaign payments.

Barr was later re-elected three times, serving from 1995 to 2003. While in Congress, Barr served as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, as vice-chairman of the Government Reform Committee, and as a member of the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Veteran&#x27;s Affairs.

In Congress, Barr became famous for his &quot;dour&quot; image and told constituents, &quot;You don&#x27;t send me to Washington to smile.&quot; He also said in a radio interview, &quot;If it&#x27;s not in the Constitution, I won&#x27;t smile.&quot; He later explained &quot;I don&#x27;t consider politicians who smile to be worth a heck of a lot... all things considered, it doesn&#x27;t make a dime&#x27;s worth of difference if the politicians in Washington smile or not, what matters is how much of your hard-earned dollars they take to spend in pure pork.&quot; Barr said in 2010, &quot;I can see a situation where the federal government is going to bring an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, and while I would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact is that this is a corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the &#x27;red state&#x27; column. The only solution to this kind of behavior is dour and austere social conservatism, like my own.&quot; Adding to his image, Barr has frequently protested about &quot;cult hairstyles&quot;, saying &quot;I cannot abide by people who adopt a cult hairstyle, or persistently dress inappropriately for meetings with me.&quot;

Georgia&#x27;s congressional districts were reorganized by the Democratic-controlled Georgia legislature ahead of the 2002 elections for the 108th Congress. As part of the legislature&#x27;s effort to get more Democrats elected from the state, Barr&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 11th District and made significantly more Democratic. A large slice of his base was drawn into the same district as fellow Republican John Linder. The new district was numerically Barr&#x27;s district – the 7th – but contained most of the territory from Linder&#x27;s old 11th District. This move profited Democrats by leading to the inevitable defeat of an incumbent Republican (i.e., either Barr or Linder). Recognizing Barr&#x27;s precarious situation, the Libertarian Party seized on the opportunity to oust one of the federal drug war&#x27;s most vocal proponents (Barr), and ran TV ads criticizing Barr&#x27;s opposition to medical marijuana during the Republican primaries. Barr was soundly defeated by a 2-to-1 margin. Before the medical marijuana ads were aired, the Linder campaign acknowledged the race as being tight; and Pat Gartland, southeastern director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called it &quot;too close to call&quot;.

Barr&#x27;s defeat was applauded by many Democrats and Libertarians. Rob Kampia of the Marijuana Policy Project called it &quot;glorious news&quot;. Ron Crickenberger, the Libertarian Party&#x27;s political director and producer of the TV ads, was quick to warn other supporters of the War on Drugs:

However, some individuals within these groups lamented Barr&#x27;s defeat as a setback for privacy rights and libertarian causes in general. J. Bradley Jansen, vice chair of the Libertarian Party in the District of Columbia, opined:

===Political positions in Congress===
During his tenure, Barr was regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress. In 2002, he was described by Bill Shipp in an OnlineAthens.com article as &quot;the idol of the gun-toting, abortion-fighting, IRS-hating hard right wing of American politics&quot;. However, Barr&#x27;s criticism of the Bush administration&#x27;s policies on privacy and other civil liberties after the 9/11 attacks was unusual among House Republicans (see &quot;Criticism of Bush Administration&quot; below). This criticism earned Barr other labels such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Jekyll-and-Hyde&quot;, and &quot;Libertarian&quot;.

====Gun ownership====
Barr is a staunch proponent of gun rights, and is opposed to any and all efforts to restrict the ownership of guns.

During the 2002 race, a supporter handed Barr an antique pistol during a fundraiser at a private home. The gun went off in Barr&#x27;s hands, though no one was injured.

====War on drugs====
Barr was originally a strong supporter of the War on Drugs, reflecting his previous experience as an Anti-Drug Coordinator for the United States Department of Justice. While in Congress, he was a member of the Speaker&#x27;s Task Force for a Drug-Free America. This task force was established in 1998 by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich to &quot;design a World War II-style victory plan to save America&#x27;s children from illegal drugs.&quot; The task force crafted legislation specifically designed to &quot;win the War on Drugs by 2002&quot;.

Barr advocated complete federal prohibition of medical marijuana. In 1998, he successfully blocked implementation of Initiative 59 – the &quot;Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998&quot; – which would have legalized medical marijuana in Washington, D.C. The &quot;Barr Amendment&quot; to the 1999 Omnibus spending bill not only blocked implementation of Initiative 59, but also prohibited the vote tally from even being released. Nearly a year passed before a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union eventually revealed the initiative had received 69 percent of the vote. In response to the judge&#x27;s ruling, Barr simply attached another &quot;Barr Amendment&quot; to the 2000 Omnibus spending bill that overturned Initiative 59 outright. The Barr Amendment also prohibited future laws that would &quot;decrease the penalties for marijuana or other Schedule I drugs&quot; in Washington, D.C. This preemptively blocked future attempts by Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) to reform marijuana laws in DC via the initiative process. In March 2002, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan struck down this portion of the Barr Amendment as being an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. Barr&#x27;s response to the ruling was defiant:

The federal government later prevailed on appeal, reinstating the Barr Amendment just in time to thwart MPP&#x27;s initiative 63 – &quot;The Medical Marijuana Initiative of 2002&quot; – which had already qualified for the November 2002 ballot. In 2009, both the United States Senate and House of Representatives voted to lift the ban against a medical marijuana initiative, effectively overturning the Barr Amendment.

Barr later reversed his position on medical marijuana, joining MPP as a lobbyist five years later. In a June 4, 2008, interview with Stephen Colbert on the &quot;Colbert Report&quot;, Barr confirmed that he now supports ending marijuana prohibition, as well as the War on Drugs, for which he once vehemently fought. In 2009, he was hired by the MPP to lobby to successfully overturn the amendment that he had authored.

====Same-sex marriage====
Barr took a lead in legislative debate concerning same-sex marriage. He wrote and sponsored the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law enacted in 1996 which states that only marriages that are between a man and a woman can be federally recognized, and individual states may choose not to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state. At the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, he apologized for the part of DOMA which prevents the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages.

He now supports same-sex marriage and opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment, having contended that it is a violation of states&#x27; rights. Before the United States Supreme Court mandated recognition of same-sex marriage in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, Barr supported the Respect for Marriage Act, which would have repealed the Defense of Marriage Act.

====Terrorism====
He voted for the first USA PATRIOT Act, but only after his amendments adding &quot;sunset clauses&quot; were added to the final bill. Barr played a similar role during the debate over Bill Clinton&#x27;s Comprehensive Anti-terrorism Act of 1995, crafting pro-civil liberties amendments to the original text. He now publicly regrets his Patriot Act vote.

====War in Iraq====
In 2002 Barr voted for the Iraq Resolution. He has since called for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, leaving no permanent military bases. A press release from Barr&#x27;s presidential campaign stated: &quot;The next president should commit to a speedy and complete withdrawal from Iraq, and tell the Iraqi people that the U.S. troops will be going home.&quot;

====Religious freedom====
In Congress, he also proposed that the Pentagon ban the practice of Wicca in the military.

====Economic freedom====
Barr advocates the repeal of the 16th Amendment, which gives the U.S. Congress the power to levy an income tax without apportionment. As an alternative, he proposes a form of consumption tax, such as the FairTax.

He also favors drastic reductions in government spending and the elimination of corporate welfare.

===Waco hearings===
The &quot;National Review&quot; described Barr as one of the few people able to &quot;ask effective questions and make clear points&quot; while questioning government witnesses during the 1995 House Waco siege hearings on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Federal Bureau of Investigation actions against the Branch Davidians in 1993, sponsored by subcommittees of the House Judiciary Committee and Government Reform and Oversight Committee. Barr has written: &quot;The hearing was a farce: a virtual lovefest, during which members of the Clinton Administration responded to softball questions from their colleagues in the House with superficial answers, and Republican queries were ignored or glossed over with disdain, if not outright contempt.&quot; Barr called for Congress to reopen investigations, but senior House Republicans refused. In 2003 testimony submitted to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Barr wrote: &quot;[T]here remains time to turn back the constitutional clock and roll back excessive post-9/11 powers before we turn the corner into another Japanese internment or, closer to our own experiences, before we witness a legally sanctioned Ruby Ridge or Waco scenario.&quot;

===Controversies over Barr&#x27;s personal conduct===
In the early 1990s, Barr was photographed at a fundraising event licking whipped cream off a woman. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; &quot;Two people who observed the act say it wasn&#x27;t exactly a bosom lick but more like a neckline lick, at the sort of event where business and civic leaders perform dares to raise money. &#x27;Not exactly Mr. Effusive,&#x27; says Matt Towery, the former chairman of Newt Gingrich&#x27;s political organization, who observed the brief and awkward licking. &#x27;You can hardly get the guy to smile.

===Role in Clinton impeachment===
Barr is best known for his role as one of the House managers during President Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial.

In the spring of 1997, Republican, Bob Barr, wrote House Committee on the Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde, encouraging him to open an impeachment inquiry. Hyde responded that such an action would be premature.

In November 1997, Barr first introduced a resolution directing the House Judiciary Committee to begin an impeachment inquiry against Clinton, with this resolution coming months before the Monica Lewinsky scandal came to light. This resolution, introduced in November 1997 did not specify any charges or allegations. Foremost among the concerns Barr cited at the time was apparent obstruction of Justice Department investigations into Clinton campaign fundraising from foreign sources, chiefly the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Barr argued that Clinton had been &quot;systematically operating outside the bounds&quot; of the law. He accused Clinton of &quot;systematic abuse of office&quot;, alleging campaign finance law violations and obstruction of congressional investigations. Eighteen other Republican members of the House of Representatives joined Barr in signing on to the resolution as co-sponsors. These members were Roscoe Bartlett, Helen Chenoweth, Barbara Cubin, John Doolittle, Lindsey Graham, Duncan L. Hunter, Sam Johnson, Jack Kingston, Jack Metcalf, John Mica, Ron Paul, Dana Rohrabacher, Pete Sessions, Chris Smith, Mark Souder, Linda Smith, Bob Stump, and Todd Tiahrt.

After the Lewinsky scandal broke, Barr was the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton&#x27;s resignation. After the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal came to light, Barr ramped up his efforts to push for Clinton&#x27;s impeachment, appearing regularly on television, as well as even publishing a scholarly article in the Texas Law Review on the subject.

During debate on the 1998 impeachment resolution on the House floor, Barr argued that Clinton&#x27;s attempt to interfere with Lewinsky&#x27;s testimony in the Paula Jones case endangered the Constitution. In doing so, Barr said, Clinton violated what Barr called a &quot;fundamental right&quot; of any American citizen – &quot;the unshakable right each one of us has to walk into a courtroom and demand the righting of a wrong.&quot;

In 1999, during Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial, &quot;Hustler&quot; publisher Larry Flynt offered money to anyone who could provide evidence about prominent Republicans who had engaged in an extramarital affair. According to the &quot;American Journalism Review&quot;, investigators for Flynt said that Barr was &quot;guilty of king-size hypocrisy.&quot; Flynt subsequently paid a sum of money to Barr&#x27;s second wife, Gail Barr, after she had sworn an affidavit. Investigators reported that Bob Barr then &quot;invoked a legal privilege from his 1985 divorce proceeding so he could refuse to answer questions on whether he&#x27;d cheated on his second wife with the woman who is now his third&quot; (Jerilyn).

==Criticism of Bush Administration==
Since leaving Congress in 2003, Barr has become a vocal opponent of the Patriot Act and has stated that he voted for it reluctantly and regrets voting for it, only agreeing because the Bush administration promised not to attempt to expand the granted powers or use them for non-terrorism purposes, and the administration agreed to report to Congress on their usage. Barr says that the Bush administration promptly ignored these three promises given to Congress and has used the powers granted from the Patriot Act to further erode due process of law even in matters unrelated to terrorism. Barr claims that the Clinton administration did much of the same thing. In 2005 – the year the Patriot Act was due for renewal – Barr helped found an organization called Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, a bipartisan group dedicated to eliminating aspects of the Patriot Act that could potentially affect law-abiding citizens rather than terrorists, and to &quot;restore traditional checks and balances on government power so the country can effectively fight terror without sacrificing the rights of innocent Americans, rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution.&quot; Barr still serves as the group&#x27;s chairman.

Barr has been a vocal opponent of President George W. Bush&#x27;s claim of authorization to wiretap transnational phone calls without individual judicial license. He has said, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with it is several-fold. One, it&#x27;s bad policy for our government to be spying on American citizens through the National Security Agency. Secondly, it&#x27;s bad to be spying on Americans without court oversight. And thirdly, it&#x27;s bad to be spying on Americans apparently in violation of federal laws against doing it without court order.&quot;

In 2006, he debated the architect of the Patriot Act, Viet Dinh, on terrorism and privacy issues.

===Departure from Republican Party===
In the 2004 presidential election, Barr left the Republican Party and publicly endorsed the Libertarian Party presidential nominee Michael Badnarik.

In 2006, he joined the Libertarian Party as a regional representative, then serving on the Libertarian National Committee.

==Political associations==
Barr sat on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America from 2001 to 2007. He became president of the group in May 2024.

Barr is a commentator on political and social issues and is chairman of the American Conservative Union Foundation&#x27;s &#x27;21st Century Center for Privacy and Freedom&#x27;.

In January 2006, to emphasize the bipartisan nature of the event, Barr planned on introducing Al Gore at a speech co-sponsored by the Liberty Coalition and the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy to address what they called the &quot;NSA Spying Scandal&quot;, in which Gore compared warrantless wiretapping to the FBI&#x27;s illegal COINTELPRO project surveilling, discrediting and disrupting Martin Luther King Jr.

===Libertarian Party===
On December 12, 2006, Barr became a regional representative on the Libertarian National Committee, representing the Party&#x27;s Southeast Region. Barr said: &quot;I&#x27;m happy to announce that I am now a proud, card-carrying Libertarian who is committed to helping elect leaders who will strive for smaller government, lower taxes and abundant individual freedom.&quot;

===Marijuana Policy Project===

In Congress, Barr&#x27;s strong stance against medical marijuana put him at odds with marijuana policy reformers such as the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP). Despite this historic antagonism, in March 2007, Barr reversed his stance on medical marijuana and began lobbying on behalf of MPP. This new partnership saw Barr working to repeal his very own &quot;Barr Amendment&quot; – the amendment that overturned a voter-approved medical marijuana initiative in Washington, D.C., and bars consideration of similar initiatives.

Barr has been careful to state that he isn&#x27;t pro-drug, but rather against government intrusion.

Barr&#x27;s reversal on drug policy surprised many, particularly MPP. His new-found appreciation for harm reduction was heartily welcomed:

===American Freedom Agenda===
Barr is one of the four founders of the American Freedom Agenda, which is described as &quot;a coalition established to restore checks and balances and civil liberties protections under assault by the executive branch.&quot; The American Freedom Agenda has established a 10-point Freedom Pledge for presidential candidates to confirm their commitment to civil liberties. He is also a member of the Constitution Project&#x27;s bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee.

===Liberty Guard===
Barr is chairman of the board of directors of Liberty Guard, an IRS 501(c)4 organization, which states its mission is to protect and defend individual liberty.

===National Popular Vote===
Barr is a supporter of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.

==Other activities==
In early 2008, Barr became an adjunct professor at Kennesaw State University and was scheduled to teach a course on privacy rights titled &quot;Privacy and Public Policy in 21st Century Business and Society.&quot;

Barr appeared in the mock documentary &quot;&quot;. In his scene, he met with &quot;Borat Sagdiyev&quot; (portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen) in the United States Capitol. Borat gave him cheese described as being made from Borat&#x27;s wife&#x27;s breast milk.

Barr endorsed the Free State Project on July 22, 2008, saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s tremendous!&quot;

Barr is listed as the President of the Law Enforcement Education Organization, a non-profit organization with a mission of serving &quot;active-duty and retired law enforcement officers, by educating and assisting law enforcement personnel and agencies meet challenges posed by certain laws and regulations.&quot;

===Publications and commentary===
Barr wrote &quot;The Meaning of Is: The Squandered Impeachment and Wasted Legacy of William Jefferson Clinton&quot; (published in 2004). He briefly wrote a regular column for &quot;Creative Loafing (Atlanta)&quot;, an alternative weekly newspaper serving the Atlanta metropolitan area.

In 2008 Barr hosted a political talk radio show on Radio America called &quot;Bob Barr&#x27;s Laws of the Universe&quot;. He has said that he plans to write a book with that title.

In August 2008, Barr published an opinion piece in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; that criticized the United States&#x27; response to the conflict between Russia and Georgia as being too emotional and not based on legitimate American national security concerns. He wrote: &quot;The most important American interest is defending America; and intervening on behalf of Georgia against Russia has nothing to do with defending America.&quot; In October 2008, Barr gave a one-hour talk at Carnegie Mellon University, allowing time to take audience questions. This was one of numerous lectures for which he was paid.

In 2008, in an Op-Ed article published in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, Barr lambasted the new policy of Boston, Massachusetts police to allow warrantless search for firearms in teenagers&#x27; homes. On March 7, 2009, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; announced that Barr would be a weekly columnist for the paper. His blog is known as &quot;The Barr Code&quot;.

===Advising Jean-Claude Duvalier===
In 2011, Barr traveled to Haiti to lobby on behalf of &quot;former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier.&quot; According to Barr, &quot;he is not serving as Duvalier&#x27;s attorney, but is in Port-au-Prince to consult, assist and be Duvalier&#x27;s voice to the international community.&quot;

==2008 presidential campaign==

In early 2008, rumors circulated that Barr was considering a presidential run under the Libertarian Party banner. Activists began a Facebook group dedicated to drafting Barr into the nomination contest, and Barr later confirmed his interest. He launched a presidential exploratory committee and campaign website on April 5, and formally announced his candidacy for the Libertarian nomination on May 12. His announcement came a mere ten days before the start of the Libertarian Party Convention, where delegates select the presidential candidate.

Following his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% nationwide against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%). The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, but most voters said they did not know enough about him to have an opinion of him personally. Barr&#x27;s support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote.

On May 25, 2008, Barr became the 2008 Libertarian presidential nominee after six rounds of voting at the 2008 Libertarian convention. He beat Mary Ruwart in the final round of voting, with 324 delegates to Ruwart&#x27;s 276, with 26 none-of-the-above votes. Barr had received the endorsement of Wayne Allyn Root, one of his rivals for the nomination, after Root was eliminated following the fifth round of balloting. Barr, in turn, endorsed Root for the party&#x27;s vice presidential nomination, which he received. &quot;Reason&quot; magazine senior editor Radley Balko called Barr &quot;the first serious candidate the LP has run since I&#x27;ve been eligible to vote.&quot;

On June 4, 2008, Barr invited the Republican Party&#x27;s presumptive presidential nominee, John McCain, and the Democratic Party&#x27;s presumptive presidential nominee, Barack Obama, to weekly presidential debates through an official press release.

Many opinion leaders predicted that Barr could siphon off conservative votes that would have otherwise gone to McCain. John Linder, who defeated Barr for the Republican nomination in a 2002 congressional race, said that Barr could cause serious problems for McCain in some states. Barr repeatedly rejected this assertion as scapegoating, responding that small-government Republicans would not vote for McCain anyway, nor would civil liberties advocates vote for Obama.

Barr appeared on the ballot in 45 states. In July, he filed a lawsuit against Oklahoma for its unusually restrictive ballot access laws, which he contends are contrary to the First Amendment right to petition one&#x27;s government for a redress of grievances. In July, a Zogby poll had Barr receiving 6% of the vote nationwide, as well as double digits in several states.

A Zogby poll released on August 15, 2008, indicated that most Republican and Democratic voters wanted Barr to be included in the presidential debates. The poll also indicated that almost 70% of independent voters would have liked to see him included.

On September 17, 2008, Barr filed suit in Texas to remove both McCain and Obama from the ballot. Both political parties failed to file their nominees by the deadline. On September 23, 2008, the Texas Supreme Court rejected the request without giving a reason for its decision.

Among his campaign positions, Barr distinguished himself strongly from Obama and McCain by opposing the financial bailout bill.

On November 4, 2008, Barr received 523,686 votes, 0.4% of the national vote.

==Return to Republican Party==

Following his statement that he would not challenge the Republican incumbent in the 2012 primary race for Georgia&#x27;s 14th congressional district, he subsequently indicated his return to the Republican Party and support for 2012 GOP congressional candidates when stating – &quot;Our country is at a serious cross-roads, without question we need new leadership in the White House, and a part of that turnaround in 2012 will be solid GOP majorities in both chambers of Congress.&quot;
===Aborted 2012 congressional campaign===
Barr had expressed interest in running for Congress again as a Republican in 2012, challenging incumbent Republican Tom Graves in Georgia&#x27;s 14th district. The newly created district included Floyd and Paulding counties, which were part of the territory Barr represented in his first congressional stint. Between them, they made up 38 percent of the 14th&#x27;s population. Barr has lived in Smyrna, in Cobb County, for many years, but told several friends he planned to move to Paulding County in order to challenge Graves. Despite strong polling numbers, Barr chose to abandon his plans for running, citing concern on the potential impact it would have on his law firm and family.

===2014 congressional campaign===
Barr held a news conference on March 28, 2013, at Adventure Outdoors in Smyrna, Georgia where he announced his upcoming run for his old congressional seat, the 11th. The seat had come open after his successor, Phil Gingrey, gave it up to run for Senate. Barr was vying to become the first Georgia Republican to return to the U.S. House after a gap in service. Barr placed second in his six-way House primary with 26% of the vote. State Senator Barry Loudermilk, who was backed by the Senate Conservatives Fund, placed first in the primary with 37%. Since no candidate won at least 50% (plus 1) of the vote, a runoff took place on July 22, 2014. Barr lost the runoff to Loudermilk by a nearly 2:1 margin.

==NRA career==

<doc id="214345" wikidata="Q190338" url="?curid=214345" title="Central Military Commission (China)">
<text>The Central Military Commission (CMC) is the highest military leadership body of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), which heads the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), the People&#x27;s Armed Police (PAP), and the Militia of China.

There are technically two separate commissions; the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central Military Commission of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Under the arrangement of &quot;one institution with two names&quot;, both commissions have identical personnel, organization and function, and operate under both the party and state systems. The commission&#x27;s parallel hierarchy allows the CCP to supervise the political and military activities of the PLA, including issuing directives on senior appointments, troop deployments and arms spending.

The CMC is chaired by Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader. Almost all the members are senior generals, but the most important posts have always been held by the party&#x27;s most senior leaders (who are civilians under the principle that the Party commands the Gun) to ensure the loyalty of the armed forces. The CMC is housed in the Ministry of National Defense compound (&quot;August 1st or &#x27;Eight-One&#x27; Building&quot;) in western Beijing.

== History ==
The party military committee dates back to October 1925, and while operating under various degrees of authority and responsibility, was consistently named the CCP Central Military Commission. Among Western commentators, &quot;Affairs&quot; is frequently dropped from the title. As a commission, it ranks higher in the party hierarchy than departments such as the Organization or United Front Departments. In 1937 the CCP Central Revolutionary Military Commission was created after the Chinese Soviet Republic&#x27;s Chinese Red Army were integrated into the Kuomintang&#x27;s army for the anti-Japanese war, and it later evolved into the Central Military Commission after the 7th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1945. In this period, the committee was always chaired by Mao Zedong.

In the September 1949 reorganization, military leadership was transferred to a government body, the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People&#x27;s Government. The final coexistence of two military committees was set in 1954, as the CCP Central Military Commission was re-established, while state military authority rested into a National Defense Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China chaired by the President in keeping with the 1954 Constitution.

As Mao Zedong was also the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and led military affairs as a whole, the CMC and NDC&#x27;s day-to-day work was carried out by its first-ranking vice-chairman, a post which was occupied by Lin Biao until his death in 1971, then by Ye Jianying. As a consequence of the Cultural Revolution, the Party CMC became the sole military overseeing body, and the National Defence Council was abolished in 1975.

Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s efforts to institutionally separate the CCP and the state led to the establishment of today&#x27;s &quot;State CMC&quot;, which was created in 1982 by the constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in order to formalize the role of the military within the government structure. Both the National Defense Commission and &quot;State CMC&quot; have been described as &#x27;consultative&#x27; bodies. Contrarily to the National Defense Council, however, the party and state CMCs are almost identical in leadership, composition, and powers.

The Commission included the post of secretary-general until 1992. This post was held by Yang Shangkun (1945–1954), Huang Kecheng (1954–1959), Luo Ruiqing (1959–1966), Ye Jianying (1966–1977), Luo Ruiqing (1977–1979), Geng Biao (1979–1981), Yang Shangkun (1981–1989), Yang Baibing (1989–1992).

In 2016, the four traditional general departments were dissolved by order of Chairman Xi Jinping, and in their place 15 new departments were created as part of the ongoing modernization of the PLA.

== Functions ==
According to the Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on National Defense, the CMC exercises leadership over border, maritime, air and other critical security defense. The CMC has the ultimate command authority over the armed forces of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, including the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), the People&#x27;s Armed Police (PAP), and the Militia.

In China&#x27;s state-party-military tripartite political system, the CMC itself is a decision-making body whose day-to-day affairs are not nearly as transparent as that of the Central Committee or the State Council. As one of China&#x27;s three main decision-making bodies the relative influence of the CMC can vary depending on the time period and the leaders. Unlike in most countries, the Central Military Commission is not an organizational equivalent of other government ministries. Although China does have a Ministry of National Defense, it exists solely for liaison with foreign militaries and does not have command authority.

== Structure ==
There are two separate commissions; the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. However, under the arrangement of &quot;one institution with two names&quot;, both commissions have identical personnel, organization and function. The commission&#x27;s parallel hierarchy allows the CCP to supervise the political and military activities of the PLA, including issuing directives on senior appointments, troop deployments and arms spending. The CMC is extremely opaque, and its meetings are almost never publicized.

The CMC is composed of a chairman, vice chairpersons, and other members. The CMC chairman is usually concurrently the CCP general secretary. The most important chain of command runs from the CMC to the 15 general departments and, in turn, to each of the service branches (ground, navy and air forces). In addition, the CMC also has direct control over the Rocket Forces, the three arms of service that were previously part of the former Strategic Support Forces (Aerospace Force, Information Support Force and Cyberspace Force), the National Defense University, and the Academy of Military Sciences.

=== Departments ===
Prior to 2016, the PLA was governed by four general departments. These were abolished after the military reforms in 2016 by order of Chairman Xi Jinping, replaced with 15 departments that report directly to the CMC. The new 15 departments are:
# General Office (Deputy Theater Grade)
# Joint Staff Department (CMC Member Grade)
# Political Work Department (CMC Member Grade)
# Discipline Inspection Commission (CMC Member Grade)
# Politics and Legal Affairs Commission (Theater Grade)
# Logistic Support Department (Deputy Theater Grade)
# Equipment Development Department (Deputy Theater Grade)
# Training Administration Department (Deputy Theater Grade)
# National Defense Mobilization Department (Deputy Theater Grade)
# Science and Technology Commission (Deputy Theater Grade)
# Office for Strategic Planning (Corps Grade)
# Office for Reform and Organizational Structure (Corps Grade)
# Office for International Military Cooperation (Corps Grade)
# Audit Office (Corps Grade)
# Agency for Offices Administration (Corps Grade)

The Joint Staff Department is the nerve center of the entire Chinese military command and control system, responsible for daily administrative duties of the CMC. The General Office processes all CMC communications and documents, coordinate meetings, and convey orders and directives to other subordinate organs.

===Joint control organs===

The Central Military Commission Joint Operations Command Center was separated from the Joint Staff in the 2015 reforms and made directly commanded by the CMC. As well as serving as the command center for overall PLA joint operations, it supervises the Joint Operation Command Organs of each of the five command theaters.

== Members ==
According to military regulations, the chairman of the CMC shall be conferred with no military rank, while vice chairmen and members of the CMC are conferred the rank of general by the virtue of their office.

The make-up of the current Central Military Commission of the CCP was determined at the 20th Party Congress held in October 2022; the state commission was confirmed at the 1st Session of the 14th National People&#x27;s Congress.

; CMC Chairman:
: Xi Jinping, also General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, President of China

; CMC Vice Chairmen (2)
# General Zhang Youxia, member of the 19th Politburo and the 20th Politburo
# General He Weidong, member of the 20th Politburo

; CMC Members (3)
# General Liu Zhenli, Chief of Staff of the Joint Staff Department
# Admiral Miao Hua, Director of the Political Work Department (Suspended)
# General Zhang Shengmin Secretary of the Commission for Discipline Inspection
== High command ==
, China&#x27;s Ministry of National Defense lists its high command as:
=== Election ===
According to the CCP constitution, the members of the Party CMC are elected by the CCP&#x27;s Central Committee. In practice, membership is very closely controlled by the CCP&#x27;s Politburo Standing Committee. Similarly, the State CMC is constitutionally elected by the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) and theoretically reports to the NPC and its Standing Committee, but is in practice indistinguishable from the Party CMC. This difference in elections results in the only difference in membership between the two bodies, as party organs, such as the Party Congress and the Central Committee assemble at different times than the National People&#x27;s Congress. For example, some were elected into the Party CMC in the 16th Party Congress in November 2002, but they entered the &quot;State CMC&quot; in March 2003, when the 1st Session of the 10th NPC convened.

<text>Motor vehicle theft or car theft (also known as a grand theft auto in the United States) is the criminal act of stealing or attempting to steal a motor vehicle.

In 2020, there were 810,400 vehicles reported stolen in the United States, up from 724,872 in 2019. Property losses due to motor vehicle theft in 2020 were estimated at $7.4 billion. There were 505,100 car thefts in the European Union (EU) in 2019, a 43% decrease from 2008.

==Methods==

Some methods used by criminals to steal motor vehicles:
* Theft of an unattended vehicle without a key: the removal of a parked vehicle either by breaking and entry, followed by hotwiring or other tampering methods to start the vehicle, or else towing. In London, the police say that 50% of the annual 20,000 car thefts are now from high-tech OBD (Onboard Diagnostic Port) key-cloning kits (available online) and bypass immobilizer simulators.
* Taking without owner&#x27;s consent (TWOC): the unauthorized use of a car short of theft. This term is used in the United Kingdom, as is the derivative &quot;twocking&quot;.
* Opportunistic theft: either the removal of a vehicle that is unattended with the keys visible and sometimes the engine idling, or theft of a vehicle offered for sale during what the thief represents as a test drive. A &quot;test drive&quot; may also give a potential thief insight into where the vehicle keys are stored, so that the thief may return later to steal the vehicle.
* Carjacking: taking a vehicle by force, or threat of force, against its owner or operator. In most places, this is the most serious form of vehicle theft, because assault also occurs and the method of taking over the vehicle is essentially a robbery, a more serious form of theft. In some carjackings, the operators and passengers are forced from the vehicle while the thief is driving it. In other incidents, the operator and/or passenger(s) are held hostage in it. In still others, which are less common, the assailant forces the lawful operator to drive in accordance with the demands of the assailant, who rides as a passenger.
* Fraudulent theft: illegal acquisition of a vehicle from a seller through fraudulent transfer of funds that the seller will ultimately not receive (such as by identity theft or counterfeiting a cashier&#x27;s check), or through the use of a loan obtained under false pretenses. Many vehicles stolen via fraud are soon resold, by the thieves. Using this approach, the thief can quietly evade detection and continue stealing vehicles in different jurisdictions. Car rental companies and car dealerships are also defrauded by car thieves into renting, selling, financing, or leasing them cars with fake identification, checks, and credit cards. This is a common practice near national borders, where tracking devices are less effective because the victims may lack jurisdiction in the countries into which the vehicles quickly are removed.
* Frosting: Occurring in winter, which involves an opportunist thief stealing a vehicle with its engine running whilst the owner de-ices it.
* &quot;Hanoi burglary&quot;, where a vehicle is taken during a house burglary, often done with the explicit purpose of obtaining car keys. Named after the first police operation targeting the method.
* Joyriding: refers to driving or riding in a stolen vehicle, most commonly a car, with no particular goal other than the pleasure or thrill of doing so.
*Keyless system theft: The risk of cars with keyless entry being stolen is high. These are cars where the owner does not have to even press a button to unlock as long as the key is located at a certain distance from the vehicle. In theory, the key&#x27;s signal should no longer reach the car when the driver moves away, making it impossible to unlock the car. Car thieves extend the signal from the owner&#x27;s key with the help of simple signal amplifiers. and then all they have to do is open the door, hit the start button and drive away unnoticed. The car&#x27;s alarm system is totally blind to this.

==Auto-theft tools and paraphernalia==
* A thin metal strap or rod that slips inside a door&#x27;s cavity at the base of the window, to manipulate an internal locking mechanism or linkage. A famously known tool is called the &quot;slim jim&quot;.
* A long rod with a hooked end that slips between door and frame, or through an opened window, that can reach and manipulate the door handle or lock from inside the vehicle cab. (A primary technique used professionally.)
* Broken pieces of ceramic, often from a spark plug insulator, used for throwing at car door windows so they shatter quietly.
* Specially cut or filed-down car keys, numerous tryout keys, jigglers and other lock picking tools.
* Slide hammer puller to break apart door locks, steering-wheel locks, and ignition switch locks by forced removal of the cylinder core.
* Multimeter or electrician&#x27;s test lamp to locate a power source, for disabling alarms and jump starting vehicles.
* Spare wires and/or a screwdriver to connect a power source to the ignition and starter wires.
* Unusual looking electronics gear that may include; laptop or tablet, radio antennas, cables, battery packs, and other modified computer components that look homemade.
* Many keyless ignition/lock cars have weak cryptographic protection of their unlock radio signal or are susceptible to some form of record-and-playback or range extending attack. While proof-of-concept &quot;thefts&quot; of top-of-the-line luxury cars have been demonstrated by academic researchers using commercially available tools, such as RFID microreaders, examples of actual car theft using these methods are not very prevalent.
* A firearm, knife or other weapon used to break a window.
* OBD key cloning kit.

==Vehicles most frequently stolen==

The makes and models of vehicles most frequently stolen vary by several factors, including region and ease of theft. In particular, the security systems in older vehicles may not be up to the same standard as current vehicles, and thieves also have longer to learn their weaknesses. Scrap metal and spare part prices may also influence thieves to prefer older vehicles.

In Bangkok, Thailand, the most frequently stolen vehicles are Toyota cars, Toyota Hilux and Isuzu D-Max pickups.

In Malaysia, Proton models are the most frequently stolen vehicles, with the Proton Wira being the highest, followed by the Proton Waja and the Proton Perdana.

In Indonesia, locally-produced MPVs such as Toyota Avanza, Daihatsu Xenia and Suzuki Ertiga are the most commonly stolen vehicles.

In the United Kingdom, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class was the most stolen car in 2018, followed by the BMW X5. Police said the growing number of vehicles featuring keyless entry technology was a contributing factor to a rising number of stolen vehicles.

In the United States and Australia, a design flaw allowing USB cables to substitute for car keys led to sharp increases in the thefts of affected Kia and Hyundai vehicles in 2022.
The Dodge Challenger and Dodge Charger are listed as the most stolen vehicles in the United States, especially those equipped with the Hellcat engine. 

In 2024, LAPD accounts over a %1,000 percent increase of Chevy Camaro thefts.

==Prevention==

There are various methods of prevention to reduce the likelihood of a vehicle getting stolen. These include physical barriers, which make the effort of stealing the vehicle more difficult. Some of these include:
* Devices used to lock a part of the vehicle necessary in its operation, such as the wheel, steering wheel, or brake pedal. A commonly used device of this kind is the steering-wheel lock (also known as a crook lock or club lock).
* Immobilisers allow the vehicle to start only if a key containing the correct chip is present in the ignition. These work by locking the steering wheel and disabling the ignition.
* Hidden kill switches cut electric current to the ignition coil, fuel pump, or other system to frustrate or slow down a thief.
* Deterrents tell the thief they are more likely to get caught if the vehicle is stolen. These include:
** Car alarm systems are triggered by breaking and entry into the vehicle.
** Microdot identification tags allow individual parts of a vehicle to be identified.
** Signs on windows warning of other deterrents, sometimes as a bluff.
** VIN etching may reduce the resale value of parts or increase risk of resale.

==Recovery of stolen vehicles==

Recovery rates for stolen vehicles vary, depending on the effort a jurisdiction&#x27;s police department puts into recovery, and devices a vehicle has installed to assist in the process.

Police departments use various methods of recovering stolen vehicles, such as random checks of vehicles that come in front of a patrol unit, checks of all vehicles parked along a street or within a parking lot using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) or keeping a watchlist of all the vehicles reported stolen by their owners. Police departments also receive tips on the location of stolen vehicles through StolenCar.com or isitnicked.com in the United Kingdom.

In the UK, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) provides vehicle registration information to certain companies for consumer protection and anti-fraud purposes. This information can be supplemented by details from the police, finance, and insurance companies. Companies that utilize this data include Carfax in the US, AutoCheck, CarCheck, and Check Car Details in the UK, Gapless in Germany, and Cartell in Ireland. These companies provide online car check services for the public and motor trade, with VinCheckFree offering services worldwide.

Vehicle tracking systems, such as LoJack, automatic vehicle location, or OnStar, may enable the location of the vehicle to be tracked by local law enforcement or a private company. Other security devices such as microdot identification allow individual parts of a vehicle to also be identified and potentially returned.

== Motor vehicle thefts by country ==

=== Statistics ===
Criminologist Frank E. Hagan wrote that, &quot;Probably the most important factor in the rate of motor vehicle theft is the number of motor vehicles per capita in the country.&quot; Using data supplied by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, New Zealand had the highest auto-theft rate for any fairly large country in the world, at 954.0 per 100,000 residents in 2020. Some cities have higher rates, such as Richmond, California, which had an auto-theft rate of 1,518.3 in 2018. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime notes &quot;that when using the figures, any cross-national comparisons should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offenses in countries, or the different methods of offense counting and recording&quot;. Crime rates in certain neighborhoods or areas in each country may also be higher or lower than the nationwide rate. Furthermore, because the vehicle theft rates shown in the table below are &quot;per 100,000 population&quot;—not per 100,000 &quot;vehicles&quot;—countries with low vehicle ownership rates will appear to have lower theft rates even if the theft rate per vehicle is relatively high.


=== Europe ===
According to Europol, in 2023, motor vehicle crime networks were the most active in Germany, Poland, Portugal and Serbia, with Serbia being the country where most stolen vehicles are stored and cloned before being shipped and sold.

=== United States ===
The FBI reported that the cities where most motor vehicles thefts took place in 2019 were Los Angeles, San Antonio, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Detroit.

<text>Avvakum Petrov (; 20 November 1620/1621 – 14 April 1682; also spelled Awakum) was a Russian Old Believer and protopope of the Kazan Cathedral on Red Square who led the opposition to Patriarch Nikon&#x27;s reforms of the Russian Orthodox Church. His autobiography and letters to the tsar and other Old Believers such as Feodosia Morozova are considered masterpieces of 17th-century Russian literature.

==Life and writings==

He was born in , in present-day Nizhny Novgorod. Starting in 1652 Nikon, as the patriarch of the Russian Church, initiated a wide range of reforms in Russian liturgy and theology. These reforms were intended mostly to bring the Russian Church into line with the other Eastern Orthodox Churches of Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

Avvakum and others strongly rejected these changes. They saw them as a corruption of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the true Church of God. The other churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies. Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these heretical beliefs and practices. 

For his opposition to the reforms, Avvakum was repeatedly imprisoned. First he was exiled to Siberia, to the city of Tobolsk, and partook in an exploration expedition under Afanasii Pashkov to the Chinese border. In 1664, after Nikon was no longer patriarch, Avvakum was allowed to return to Moscow, and was then exiled again to Mezen. He was then allowed to return to Moscow again for the Church Council of 1666–67, but due to his continued opposition to the reforms, he was exiled to Pustozyorsk, above the Arctic Circle, in 1667. For the last fourteen years of his life, he was imprisoned there in a pit or dugout (a sunken, log-framed hut). He and his accomplices were finally executed by being . The spot where he was burned has been commemorated by an ornate wooden cross.

Avvakum&#x27;s autobiography recounts hardships of his imprisonment and exile to the Russian Far East, the story of his friendship and fallout with Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, his practice of exorcising demons and devils, and his boundless admiration for nature and other works of God. Numerous manuscript copies of the text circulated for nearly two centuries before it was first printed in 1861.

== &quot;The Life of the Archpriest Avvakum&quot; ==
&quot;The Life of the Archpriest Avvakum&quot;, originally titled &quot;The Life Written By Himself&quot; () is a hagiography and autobiography written by the Old Believer and prototope (archpriest) Avvakum Petrovich. The text discusses Avvakum&#x27;s struggle against Patriarch Nikon&#x27;s reforms during the Schism of the Russian Church and extensively details the trials he experienced during various exiles in Siberia. The text is remarkable for its style, which blends high Old Church Slavonic with low Russian vernacular and profanity. &quot;The Life&quot; is considered &quot;one of medieval Russia&#x27;s finest literary works&quot; and was regarded highly by both Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

=== Historical background ===

==== Schism of the Russian Church ====
In the 17th century, the Russian Church underwent significant reforms spearheaded by Patriarch Nikon and supported by Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich. The resulting split in the Russian Church between supporters of the reforms and their opponents, who came to be known as the Old Believers, is known as the Schism of the Russian Church.

Historian Georg Bernhard Michels writes that &quot;the Russian Orthodox Church became a significant target of popular hostility during the second half of the seventeenth century.&quot; Having survived the destabilizing Time of Troubles, the Church had become a &quot;powerful bureaucracy&quot; by the 1630s. As the Time of Troubles was seen as a punishment for impiety, the Church was &quot;intensely conservative&quot; and &quot;aspired to restore the &#x27;ancient piety&#x27; in its fullness.&quot;

This drive for strengthening and purification was further influenced by the Ruthenian Orthodox revival led by Petro Mohyla in Kiev in the 1630s to 1640s, who likewise sought to strengthen Orthodox religiosity and spirituality in Ruthenia. In Kiev and Lviv, &quot;Orthodox brotherhoods set up schools under the direct patronage of the patriarch of Constantinople.&quot;

In the late 1640s, Nikon and Avvakum were members of the Zealots of Piety (known also as &quot;bogolyubtsy&quot;, i.e. &quot;lovers of God&quot;), a circle of ecclesiastical and secular figures who aimed to improve religious and civilian life and to purify and strengthen the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church. Gradually, a split appeared in this circle: while certain Zealots echoed the sentiments of the Ruthenian revival, others, most notably Avvakum, &quot;felt that homespun truths were sufficient and suspected foreigners of [cunning], which would adulterate the simple, strong native faith.&quot; When Nikon became the patriarch of Moscow and all Russia in 1652, he initiated ambitious reforms, entrusting &quot;Jesuit-trained scholars from Ukraine and White Russia with a critical review of the forms of Russian worship.&quot; This exacerbated tensions with and among the Zealots, who &quot;wanted to create a church which was morally pure and close to the ordinary Russian people&quot;.

Tsar Alexei and Patriarch Nikon, by contrast, had imperial aspirations. Nikon&#x27;s vision of ecclesiastical restoration assumed the &quot;continued dominance of the church over state&quot; and stretched beyond Muscovy to the &quot;entire Eastern Christian ecumene.&quot; Nikon&#x27;s ambitions were further strengthened by his &quot;contact with Greek and Ukrainian churchmen&quot; and by Russian territorial gains in the Russo-Polish War of 1654–1667. After the Ruthenian revival, western Slavic Orthodox practices became closer to those of Greek Orthodoxy than to the Russian tradition, which had been increasingly isolated from the Greek Orthodox Church over the past several centuries. Nikon sought, likewise, to bring Russian church practice into line with Greek Orthodoxy. Russian linguist Alexander Komchatnov further emphasizes that that goal was in line with Muscovy&#x27;s newly developed imperial aims, allowing Russia to position itself at the center of the whole Orthodox world instead of remaining a marginal religious entity.

From 1653 to 1656, Nikon&#x27;s reforms changed the manner of making the sign of the cross (from the &quot;dvoeperstie&quot;, the two-fingered cross, to the &quot;troeperstie,&quot; the three-fingered cross), introduced new liturgical vestments modeled in the Greek style, and imposed a normalized revision of liturgical books.

Those opposing Nikon&#x27;s reforms came to be known as the Old Believers. Their texts painted the Schism as an apocalyptic contest between good and evil, with Nikon as the Antichrist. They were continually repressed, arrested, and exiled from the onset of Nikon&#x27;s reforms.

Nikon and Tsar Alexei soon fell out, and Nikon was placed in confinement, but the tsar continued to enforce his reforms. In 1666, the Great Moscow Synod summoned by Tsar Alexei anathematized all who refused to abide by Nikon&#x27;s changes. A trial of the Zealots was held and leading Old Believers, Avvakum among them, were exiled beyond the Arctic Circle to Pustozersk on the Pechora River, in today&#x27;s Nenets-Autonomous Okrug, 27 km from Naryan-Mar. The reforms and their enforcement prompted outright rebellions that continued over the next several decades. 

==== Persecution of Avvakum and the Old Believers ====
In 1653, Avvakum and his family were exiled to Tobolsk, Siberia. In 1655, they were moved to Yeniseysk, from which Avvakum departed with A.F. Pashkov&#x27;s expedition to Dauria on the Chinese border, traveling past Lake Baikal to Nerchinsk. In 1664, Avvakum returned to Tobolsk, remaining for two years before being permitted to return to Moscow in 1664. Several months later he was once more exiled with his family to Mezen. He was permitted to return to Moscow for the Great Moscow Synod of 1666-1667, but was finally exiled to Pustozersk alongside his fellow Old Believers Lazar, Fyodor, and Epifany. From 1670 onward, they were condemned to life &quot;on bread and water&quot; in a dugout, where they lived until they were burned alive on 14 April 1682. During his imprisonment, Avvakum wrote his autobiography; the first version of &quot;The Life&quot; was drafted in 1669–1672, and the subsequent three redactions from 1672 to 1675. The trials he suffered in his numerous exiles are largely the subject of this text.

=== Genre ===
Avvakum referred to his memoir as a hagiography (Russian: житие), which might suggest that he was characterizing himself as a saint, though he may have referred to it that way because, simply, no other word for what we would today call &quot;autobiography&quot; had yet been coined. Scholars such as Alan Wood consider &quot;The Life&quot; a prototype of Siberian prison literature, a tradition that would most famously be continued by Fyodor Dostoevsky (&quot;Notes from the House of the Dead&quot;) in the 19th century and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (&quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;) in the 20th. 

=== Content ===

==== Early life ====
Avvakum&#x27;s account largely follows his biography. He was born circa 1620 in Grigorevo in present-day Nizhny Novgorod Oblast to an alcoholic priest named Pyotr, who died while Avvakum was a child, and a nun, Maria. Avvakum married a merchant&#x27;s daughter, Nastasya Markovna, at age 17, became a deacon at 21, a priest at 23, and an Archpriest in Yurevyets at 28. By his own account, Avvakum appears to be a passionate, faithful man, who was nonetheless often harsh and unforgiving in his religious zeal. Before the Nikonian reforms, he dealt harshly with harlequins (&quot;skomorokhi&quot;), lechery, and unbelievers. His zeal causes continuous conflicts with local boyars and officials. Eventually, Avvakum flees to Moscow, where he encounters Nikon as the latter is rising in prominence. The two are initially friends, but Nikon begins his reforms soon thereafter, forcing several dissenting members of the clergy to undergo shearings, markings, and exile. Avvakum himself is also seized, and is exiled with his family to Siberia.

==== Exile in Siberia and expedition to Dauria ====
Avvakum extensively describes his first exile to Tobolsk and his experience on the forced expedition to Dauria, led by Afanasy Pashkov. Pashkov orders that Avvakum be beaten, but Avvakum&#x27;s prayer alleviates his pain. The travelers become so hungry that they eat a newborn foal, along with its blood and afterbirth, but two of Avvakum&#x27;s sons eventually die. Amidst these trials, Avvakum heals the mad and the ill and urges them to repent.

Avvakum also denounces shamanism. In one episode, Pashkov sends his son Eremej to battle in Mongolian territory, but first asks a shaman to predict the outcome of the war. The shaman predicts victory. Avvakum is angered, knowing the shaman to be channeling devils, and prays for the demise of Pashkov&#x27;s men. However, recalling the previous kindness of Eremej, he is overcome by pity, and asks the Lord to pardon him. Pashkov&#x27;s men are decimated but Eremej is spared, and a vision of Avvakum appears to Eremej to lead him back home from the wilderness. Pashkov is nonetheless angry with Avvakum for his malignant prayers. Avvakum concludes his description of Pashkov&#x27;s military expedition thus: &quot;Ten years he tormented me, or I him — I don&#x27;t know. It will be sorted out on Judgement Day.&quot; Avvakum also extensively describes the beauties and bounty of the land explored during the expedition to Dauria.

Avvakum describes saving a man by lying about his whereabouts. Avvakum asks whether, having lied, he has sinned and should seek penance. The narrative is then interrupted by words of absolution attributed to Avvakum&#x27;s confessor, Epifany:&quot;God doth forgive and bless thee in this age and that to come, together why thy helpmate Anastasia and thy daughter, and all they house. Ye have acted rightly and justly. Amen.&quot;
==== Return to Moscow and imprisonment in Pustozersk ====
Returning from exile, Avvakum writes of being well received in Moscow by the boyars and the tsar, whom Avvakum describes charitably despite the oppression he himself faced. However, due to Avvakum&#x27;s continued condemnation of the reforms, the tsar eventually exiles him once more, this time to Mezen, where Avvakum spends a year and half with his family. He is brought to Moscow again during the Great Moscow Synod of 1666–67, though this time he is received poorly and is imprisoned in Pafnut&#x27;yev monastery and in a cell in St. Nikola&#x27;s. Avvakum publicly denounces the Nikonian reforms before the Eucemenical Council of Patriarchs. (92–93). After this, he and Lazar, Fyodor, and Epifany are banished to Pustozersk. During this time, many of Avvakum&#x27;s followers are punished. Though Avvakum&#x27;s fellows in Pustozersk are physically mutilated by their guards and their tongues, fingers, or hands cut off, God grants them all supernatural healing. Soon after, they are imprisoned in a dugout cabin.

==== Exorcisms of Devils ====
Avvakum concludes &quot;The Life&quot; with several accounts of exorcisms performed by him, culminating in the attempted exorcism of a woman in Tobolsk. During the protracted struggle between Avvakum and the devils who possess the woman, she dies for four days. When she wakes, she tells Avvakum she had been led by angels to a beautiful mansion which, they told her, belong to Avvakum. Avvakum eventually heals her and she becomes a nun named Agafya. Avvakum ends by beseeching his confessor Epifany to write down his own life story, and to speak not for himself, but for the love of Christ.

=== Themes ===

==== Protest of Nikonian heresy ====
Avvakum describes the schism in apocalyptic terms: &quot;God poured forth the vials of his wrath upon the kingdom! And still those poor souls didn&#x27;t come to their senses, and kept right on stirring up the Church. Then Neronov spoke, and he told the tsar the three pestilences that come of the schism in the Church: the plague, the sword, and division.&quot; He writes of being mindful that his wife and children bear the punishment as a consequence of his dissent, but he also writes of his wife&#x27;s insistence that he remain true to the faith. In response to his doubt, the Archpriestess Nastasya Markova hardens his resolve:&quot;Now stand up and preach the Word of God like you used to and don&#x27;t grieve over us... Now go on, get to the church, Petrovič, unmask the whoredom of heresy!&quot; Well, sir, I bowed low to her for that, and shaking off the blindness of a heavy heart, I began to preach and teach the Word of God about the tows and everywhere, and yet again did I unmask the Nikonian heresy with boldness.

==== Endurance of physical violence ====
&quot;The Life&quot; is full of accounts of violent beatings and trials that Avvakum endures without resistance. This theme is further extended to Avvakum&#x27;s endurance of his fate. Avvakum describes how, when his barge was swept away on the Khilok River, he expressed no bitterness: &quot;Everything was smashed to bits! But what could be done if Christ and the most immaculate Mother of God deigned it so? I was laughing coming out of the water, but the people there were oh&#x27;ing and ah&#x27;ing as they hung my clothes around on bushes.&quot; An episode with Avvakum&#x27;s wife Nastasya Markovna further emphasizes the theme of endurance:The poor Archpriestess tottered and trudged along, and then she&#x27;d fall in a heap — fearful slippery it was! Once she was trudging along and she caved in, and another just as weary up into her and right there caved in himself. They were both shouting, but they couldn&#x27;t get up. The peasant was shouting &quot;Little mother, my Lady, forgive me!&quot; But the Archpriestess was shouting, &quot;Why&#x27;d you crush me, father?&quot; I came up, and the poor dear started in on me, saying, &quot;Will these sufferings go on a long time, Archpriest?&quot; And I said, &quot;Markovna, right up to our very death.&quot; And so she sighed and answered, &quot;Good enough, Petrovič, then let&#x27;s be getting on.&quot;

==== Holy and supernatural elements ====
Avvakum frequently relies on prayer and God&#x27;s grace to survive the many trials he is put through and to conquer the forces he encounters. For instance, Avvakum and his family are saved from a storm on the Tunguska river by God&#x27;s grace in response to his prayer.

In an episode in which he heals two madwomen, Avvakum describes at length how to drive the devil out of the body: &quot;The devil&#x27;s no peasant, he&#x27;s not afraid of a club. He&#x27;s afraid of the Cross of Christ, and of holy water, and of holy oil, and of plain cuts and runs before the Body of Christ.&quot; The madwomen are only rid of their madness when they live with Avvakum, becoming mad again the moment they are sent away. Avvakum is also able to sense the devils summoned by the shaman invited by Pashkov:That evening this peasant sorcerer brought out a live ram close by my shelter and started over conjuring it, twisting it this way and that, and he twisted its head off and tossed it aside. Then he started galloping around and dancing and summoning devils, and after considerable shouting he slammed himself against the ground and foam ran out of his mouth. The devils were crushing him, but he asked of them, &quot;Will the expedition be successful?&quot; And the devils said, &quot;You will come back with a greatly victory and with much wealth.&quot;Avvakum also describes how once, during winter in Dauria, he had to travel across a great stretch of ice but fell from weariness and thirst. In his response to his prayer for water, God splintered and parted the ice, leaving him a small hole from which to drink. Avvakum draws a parallel between this episode and God&#x27;s mercy to the Israelites wandering in the Sinai. In other instances, the holy fool Fyodor is chained but, &quot;by God&#x27;s will,&quot; the chains fall to pieces, and various others whose tongues are cut out miraculously grow new tongues.

==== Depiction of Siberian nature ====
Valerie Kivelson remarks that Avvakum&#x27;s depictions of Siberia present an image of &quot;excessive, luxuriant bounty.&quot; On the journey to Dauria, Avvakum writes of the extremes of nature that he encountered:Around it mountains were high and the cliffs of rock, fearfully high; twenty-thousand versts and more I&#x27;ve dragged myself, and I&#x27;ve never seen their like anywhere. Along their summits are halls and turrets, gates and pillars, stone walls and courtyards, all made by God. Onions grow there and garlic, bigger than the Romanov onion and uncommonly sweet.He writes that there is &quot;no end of to the birds, geese and swans.&quot; He recounts the many different kinds of fish that live alongside seals and sea lions, commenting that the fish are so oily that &quot;you can&#x27;t cook them in a pan — there&#x27;d be nothing but fat left!&quot;

Bruce T. Holl notes that Avvakum depicted Siberia both as hell and as heaven. In &quot;The Life,&quot; the horrific struggle against vast Siberian distances, the harsh cold and the ensuing hunger and thirst — which prompt hellish instances of eating infant foals and carrion — are interposed with rhapsodies waxing poetic about the beautiful Siberian landscape and the God-given bountiful excess it keeps as its treasure.

=== Style ===
Avvakum&#x27;s &quot;The Life&quot; has been greatly valued for its unique style. Russian linguist Viktor Vinogradov observed that &quot;The Life&quot; uniquely combined two entirely different linguistic registers, mixing high literary language with low vernacular, colloquialisms, and profanity. Vinogradov further remarks that this mixture of linguistic forms is simultaneously present on the level of imagery, as Avvakum combines high, exalted imagery with the low, bodily, and material.

==Legacy==
Despite his persecution and death, groups rejecting the liturgical changes persisted. They came to be referred to as Old Believers.

<doc id="214366" wikidata="Q473939" url="?curid=214366" title="Aegithalidae">
<text>The bushtits or long-tailed tits are small passerine birds from the family Aegithalidae, containing 13 species in three genera, all but one of which (&quot;Psaltriparus&quot;) are found in Eurasia. Bushtits are active birds with long tails compared to their size, moving almost constantly while they forage for insects in shrubs and trees. During non-breeding season, birds live in flocks of up to 50 individuals. Several bushtit species display cooperative breeding behavior, also called helpers at the nest.

== Distribution and habitat ==
All the Aegithalidae are forest birds, particularly forest edge and understory habitats. The species in the genus &quot;Aegithalos&quot; prefer deciduous or mixed deciduous forests, while the Indonesian pygmy bushtit is found mostly in montane coniferous forest. Bushtits are found in a wide range of habitats, including on occasion sagebrush steppe and other arid shrublands, but are most common in mixed woodland. Most species in this family live in mountainous habitats in and around the Himalayas, and all are found in Eurasia except the American bushtit, which is native to western North America. The long-tailed tit has the most widespread distribution of any species of Aegithalidae, occurring across Eurasia from Britain to Japan. Two species, in contrast, have tiny distributions, the Burmese bushtit, which is entirely restricted to two mountains in Burma, and the pygmy bushtit, which is restricted to the mountains of western Java. The species in this family are generally not migratory, although the long-tailed tit is prone to dispersing in the northern edges of its range (particularly in Siberia). Many mountainous species move to lower ground during the winter.

== Description ==

They are small birds, measuring in length, including the relatively long tail, and weighing just . Their plumage is typically dull grey or brown, although some species have white markings and the long-tailed tit has some pinkish colour. In contrast to the rest of the family the two &quot;Leptopoecile&quot; tit-warblers are quite brightly coloured, having violet and blue plumage. The crested tit-warbler is the only member of the family to have a crest. The bills in this family are tiny, short and conical in shape. The wings are short and rounded and the legs are relatively long.

==Behaviour==
Birds in this family live in flocks ranging from 4 to over 50 individuals. Flocks form as soon as one breeding season finishes and last until the next one begins. They maintain contact by contact calls that vary among species; their songs are quiet or nonexistent. Other species of birds, such as tits or warblers, will occasionally join the flock to forage.

===Diet and feeding===
Bushtits are insectivorous, primarily eating insects and other invertebrates such as leafhoppers, treehoppers, aphids, scale insects, and caterpillars. Plant material, such as berries or seeds, is taken occasionally during the winter. The family generally forages arboreally, usually in the shrub layer or canopy, and seldom visits the ground. Prey is generally gleaned from branches, leaves and buds. Less frequently, prey is taken in the air. While foraging, this agile family may hang upside down on branches (although this behaviour is not thought to occur in the tit-warblers) and even manipulate branches and leaves in order to locate hidden food.

===Breeding===
The family generally has a monogamous breeding system; however, there is some evidence that the American bushtit may be frequently polyandrous and occasionally polygynandrous or polygynous. Pairs may be aided by helpers, where a related or unrelated individual (or more than one) helps the established pair raise the young. This has been recorded in at least four of the species; further research is required to see if the behavior carries over to other members of the family. Aegithalids make domed or hanging, bag-like nests of woven cobwebs and lichen, which they line with feathers. Many nests are constructed in trees with thick foliage, making them difficult for predators to find. However, the American bushtit often places nests such that it is entirely exposed. The clutch comprises 5 to 10 white eggs, which in many of the species have red speckles. Adults incubate the eggs for 13 to 14 days; young stay in the nest for 16 to 18 days. In at least four of the species (the long-tailed tit, the black-throated bushtit, and silver-throated bushtit), only the female incubates. Young chicks are fed exclusively on insects and spiders.

== Taxonomy==
The family Aegithalidae (as a subfamily Aegithalinae) was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1850. The name comes from the Ancient Greek word for a tit. Aristotle recognised three species: the long-tailed tit, the great tit, and the Eurasian blue tit.

The pygmy bushtit is placed in this family because it moves around in flocks and its nests resemble the long-tailed tits&#x27;, but information about it is so scanty that the placement is only provisional. The Burmese bushtit is sometimes treated as conspecific with the black-browed bushtit. The American bushtit was once thought to belong to the chickadee family, but it has distinctive behavioral habits, especially when it comes to nesting.

There are 13 species in 3 genera.

<doc id="214369" wikidata="Q692828" url="?curid=214369" title="Penduline tit">
<text>The penduline tits constitute the family Remizidae, of small passerine birds related to the true tits. All but the verdin make elaborate bag nests hanging from trees (whence &quot;penduline&quot;, hanging), usually over water.

==Characteristics==
Penduline tits are tiny passerines, ranging from 7.5 to 11 cm in length, that resemble the true tits (Paridae) but have finer bills with more needle-like points. Their wings are short and rounded and their short tails are notched (except the stub-tailed tit). The penduline tits&#x27; typical plumage colors are pale grays and yellows and white, though the European penduline tit has black and chestnut markings and some species have bright yellow or red.

==Distribution and habitat==
The penduline tits live in Eurasia and Africa and North America. The genus &quot;Remiz&quot; is almost exclusively Palearctic, ranging discontinuously from Portugal and the tip of northern Morocco through to Siberia and Japan. The largest genus, &quot;Anthoscopus&quot;, is found in sub-Saharan Africa from the Sahel through to South Africa. The verdin lives in arid parts of the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico.

Several species of penduline tit are migratory, although this behaviour is only shown in species found in Asia and Europe; African species and the verdin are apparently sedentary. The Eurasian penduline tit is migratory over parts of its range, with birds in northern Europe moving south in the winter but birds in southern Europe remaining close to their breeding areas. In contrast the Chinese penduline tit is fully migratory and undertakes long-distance migrations.

Most live in open country with trees or bushes, ranging from desert to marsh to woodland, but the forest penduline tit lives in rain forest. They spend most of the year in small flocks.

==Behaviour==

Insects form the larger part of the diet of the penduline tits, and they are active foragers. Their long conical bill is used to probe into cracks and prise open holes in order to obtain prey. Nectar, seeds and fruits may also be taken seasonally. Their foraging behaviour is reminiscent of the true tits (Paridae), foraging upside-down on small branches, manoeuvring branches and leaves with their feet in order to inspect them, and clasping large prey items with one foot while dismembering them.

The common name of the family reflects the tendency of most species to construct elaborate pear-shaped nests. These nests are woven from spiderweb, wool and animal hair and soft plant materials, which are suspended from twigs and branches in trees. The nests of the African genus &quot;Anthoscopus&quot; are even more elaborate than the Eurasian &quot;Remiz&quot;, incorporating a false entrance above the true entrance which leads to a false chamber. The true nesting chamber is accessed by the parent opening a hidden flap, entering and then closing the flap shut again, the two sides sealing with sticky spider webs.
The verdin builds a domed nest out of thorny twigs. In some penduline tit species the eggs are white, sometimes with red spots. The verdin lays blue-green eggs with red spots. Incubation lasts about 13 or 14 days, and the nestlings fledge at about 18 days. In penduline tits, higher incidents of extra-pair paternity results in lower rates of male care, suggesting that extra-pair offspring devalues parental care.

==Systematics==
The family Remizidae was introduced in 1891 (as Remizeae) by the French ornithologist Léon Olphe-Galliard. Sometimes, these birds are included as subfamily Remizinae in the tit family Paridae. Which taxonomic lineup scientists prefers is primarily a matter of taste; that these families are close relatives is well established by now. If they are considered a separate family, the sultan tit and the yellow-browed tit would possibly need to be excluded from the Paridae. The placement of the tit-hylia within this family is particularly controversial, it having variously been placed with the sunbirds, waxbills, honeyeaters and most recently close to the green hylia. It is placed in the family Cettiidae.

The family contains 11 species in 3 genera:

<text>Joshua Waitzkin (born December 4, 1976) is an American former chess player, martial arts world champion, and author. As a child, he was recognized as a prodigy, and won the U.S. Junior Chess championship in 1993 and 1994. The film &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; is based on his early life.

==Early life and education==
Waitzkin first noticed the game of chess being played while walking with his mother in New York City&#x27;s Washington Square Park at the age of six. At age seven, Waitzkin began studying the game with his first formal teacher Bruce Pandolfini. During his years as a student at Dalton he led the school to win seven national team championships between the third and ninth grades, in addition to his eight individual titles. In 1999, Waitzkin enrolled at Columbia University, where he studied philosophy.

At ten years old, Waitzkin played a notable game featuring a sacrifice of his queen and rook in exchange for a checkmate six moves later. At 11, Waitzkin and fellow prodigy K. K. Karanja were the only two children to draw with World Champion Garry Kasparov in an exhibition event where Kasparov played simultaneously against 59 youngsters. At age 13, he earned the title of National Master, and at age 16 became an International Master.

Waitzkin has not played in a US Chess Federation tournament since 1999, and his last FIDE tournament was before 2000. Waitzkin has also stated in an interview his reasoning for leaving chess:When people ask me why I stopped playing chess ... I tend to say that I lost the love. And I guess if I were to be a little bit more true, I would say that I became separated from my love; I became alienated from chess somewhat ... The need that I felt to win, to win, to win all the time, as opposed to the freedom to explore the art more and more deeply, and I think that started to move me away from the game and also chess for me was so intimate. It was something that I loved so deeply that when I started to become alienated from it, I couldn&#x27;t do it in an impure way.

===Film portrayal===
The script for Paramount Pictures&#x27; 1993 film &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; (released in the United Kingdom as &quot;Innocent Moves&quot;) was based on a 1988 book by Waitzkin&#x27;s father, Fred Waitzkin: &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer: The Father of a Prodigy Observes the World of Chess&quot;. Waitzkin makes a cameo in the film, in a scene in the last quarter of the movie (at 1:21:52) where his father is watching a young Josh play Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne) from a bench. The real Waitzkin (16 years old at the time) can be seen wearing a black jacket/white hoodie playing chess right next to the film&#x27;s version of Waitzkin and is sitting across from Josh&#x27;s father (Joe Mantegna).

==Author==
Waitzkin is the author of two books: &quot;Attacking Chess: Aggressive Strategies, Inside Moves from the U.S. Junior Chess Champion&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance&quot; (2008), an autobiographical discussion of the learning process and performance psychology drawn from Waitzkin&#x27;s experiences in both chess and the martial arts. He is also the spokesperson for the &quot;Chessmaster&quot; video game series, and is featured in the game giving advice and game analysis.

Waitzkin has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss&#x27; book &quot;Tools of Titans&quot;.

==Martial arts==
As a young adult, Waitzkin&#x27;s focus shifted to the martial art tai chi. He holds several US national medals and a 2004 world champion title in the competitive sport of tai chi pushing hands. Waitzkin also became a championship coach, leading Grandmaster William C. C. Chen&#x27;s US Pushing Hands Team to several titles at the Tai Chi World Cup in Taiwan, guiding teammates Jan Lucanus and Jan C. Childress to their world titles. Waitzkin is also a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under world champion and Brazilian jiu-jitsu phenomenon Marcelo Garcia. Waitzkin is the co-founder of MGInAction.com and The Marcelo Garcia Academy, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu school located in New York City.

==Personal life==
On April 23, 2010, Waitzkin married Desiree Cifre, a screenwriter and former contestant on &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.

In an interview with Dr Andrew Huberman on the podcast, The Huberman Lab in January 2025, Waitzkin reported that he had drowned while doing breathwork in a swimming pool. He also mentioned that he broke his back while sparring during a Jiu Jitsu training session. This injury ultimately led to Waitzkin retiring from competitive Jiu Jitsu and instead begun coaching others in it.

His grandmother was artist Stella Waitzkin.

<text>The American bushtit, or simply bushtit (Psaltriparus minimus), is a social songbird belonging to the genus [[Psaltriparus]]. It is one of the smallest passerines in North America and it is the only species in the family Aegithalidae that is found in United States; the other seven species are found in Eurasia.

The American bushtit&#x27;s distinguishing characteristics are its petite size, its plump and large head, and its long tail. Its scattered range stretches from highland parts of Mexico and the Western United States to Vancouver, via the Great Basin, the lowlands and foothills of California, southern Mexico, and Guatemala. Bushtits usually inhabit mixed open woodlands, which contains oaks and a scrubby chaparral understory. They can also be found residing in gardens and parks. Their food source is small insects, primarily, spiders in mixed-species feeding flocks.

The sharp-shinned hawk and other birds prey upon American bushtits. Bushtits live in flocks of 10 to 40 birds and family members sleep together in their large, hanging nest during breeding season. Once the offspring develop wings that are developed enough to fly, they leave the nest and sleep on branches. Bushtits display a unique behavior as adult males are typically the helpers that assists and raises the nestlings; hence it has intrigued many naturalists for its interesting breeding and mating patterns.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;bushtit&quot; has its earliest known origins in the Latin word &quot;parus,&quot; which stands for titmouse. The &quot;tit&quot; in titmouse comes from the Old Icelandic word , meaning something small.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name &quot;Parus minimus&quot; was given to the bushtit after it was originally described in 1837 by American naturalist and ornithologist John Kirk Townsend, where he reported that the species inhabited the forests of the Columbia River. It is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Psaltriparus&quot; that was introduced in 1850 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The genus name &quot;Psaltriparus&quot; combines the genus &quot;Psaltria&quot; that was introduced by Coenraad Temminck in 1836 for the pygmy bushtit with &quot;Parus&quot; that was introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the tits.

There are 10 subspecies recognized:
The subspecies &quot;P. m. melanotis&quot; was previously considered as a separate species due to their black ears.

==Description ==
With a length of 4.3 inches and a weight of 0.18-0.21 ounces, the American bushtit is one of the smallest passerines in North America. It is mostly gray-brown in color, with a large head, short neck, long tail, and small, stubby beak. Moreover, bushtits have different characteristics based on their sex and habitats. The male has dark brown to black eyes while the adult female has yellow eyes. Additionally, bushtits who stay near the coast tend to have a brown &quot;cap&quot; or &quot;crowns&quot;, while those further inland have a brown &quot;mask&quot; on their faces.

The subspecies (&quot;P. m. melanotis&quot;) can be recognized from its dark ear patch, called the auricular. This feature does not occur in the northern part of the American bushtits&#x27; range and it was first seen near the Mexican border, mainly in Texas. None of the bushtits in that location with the black ear patch are adult females; the majority of them are juvenile males with one or two dark lines on their faces rather than a whole patch. Only in the northeastern Mexican highlands does the black-eared variant become more prevalent farther south; all males have a full black ear patch, and even mature females have a black arc covering their eyes and typically a black line across them.

=== Identifications ===
== Behavior ==
Bushtits usually inhabits mixed open woodlands, which contains oaks and a scrubby chaparral understory. It can also be found residing in gardens and parks. It lives under the highland parts of Mexico and the western United States to Vancouver, via the Great Basin, the lowlands and foothills of California, southern Mexico, and Guatemala.

Regarding its behavior, the American bushtit has an active and social demeanor. This species forms flocks of 10 to 40 individuals of various species, including chickadees and warblers, to forage for tiny insects and spiders in mixed-species environment. Group members frequently communicate with one another through what might be called brief spit calls.

=== Nesting ===
Both the males and females work together to construct the hanging nest, which can take up to a month to complete. The nest features a hole near the top that goes down into the nest bowl, and it hangs up to a foot below its anchor point. Using spider webs and plant material, the adults create an elastic sac. Occasionally, they sit inside the nest while it&#x27;s still being built, which stretches it downward. They cover the outside with fragments of adjacent plants, including the tree the nest is made in, and add insulating materials like feathers, fur, and downy plant debris. All the adults connected to the nest, including the breeding pair and helpers, sleep there when it&#x27;s in use. Typically, the couple uses the same nest for their second brood of the year. Regarding its placement, the male and female hang spiderwebs from mistletoe or other foliage to test-sites for their nests. Nest locations are typically found on tree trunks or branches, ranging in height from three to one hundred feet.

=== Breeding ===
Female bushtits lay plain white oval eggs in batches of 4-10, but both parents share the responsibility of incubation for 11–13 days. The egg is 0.5-0.6 inches in length and 0.4 inches in width. Once the chicks hatch, both the male and female bushtits coorperate to feed and care for them for 14–18 days. They can raise 1-2 broods a year, and older siblings from the first brood may assist in feeding the next.

During the breeding season, male and female bushtits form pairs, actively participate in nest-building, and both engage in rearing the young. They are aided by other adult males who bring food to the nesting pair&#x27;s nest. Remarkably, during this time, the entire bushtit family sleeps together in their large, hanging nest, unlike most breeding birds where only one adult typically sleeps on the nest at a time. After the young birds fledge, they move to sleeping on branches.

However, bushtits can be sensitive during the breeding process. If there are disturbances in the early nesting stages, they may abandon their nesting attempt and potentially seek a different mate.

<text>The Hate Crime Statistics Act, 28 U.S.C. § 534 (HCSA), passed in 1990 and modified in 2009 by the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, requires the Attorney General to collect data on crimes committed because of the victim&#x27;s race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. The bill was signed into law by George H. W. Bush, and was the first federal statute to &quot;recognize and name gay, lesbian and bisexual people.&quot; Since 1992, the Department of Justice through one of its agencies, the FBI, has jointly published an annual report on hate crime statistics.

On November 16, 2020, the FBI released its 2019 Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA) report with the total number of reported hate crime incidents rising 2.7% to 7,317 (2019) from  7,120 (2018).

<text>James Byrd Jr. (May 2, 1949 – June 7, 1998) was an American man who was murdered by three men, two of whom were avowed white supremacists, in Jasper, Texas, on June 7, 1998. Shawn Berry, Lawrence Brewer, and John King dragged him for behind a Ford pickup truck along an asphalt road. Byrd, who remained conscious for much of his ordeal, was killed about halfway through the dragging when his body hit the edge of a culvert, severing his right arm and head. The murderers drove on for another before dumping his torso in front of a black cemetery.

Brewer and King were the first white men to be sentenced to death for killing a black person in the history of modern Texas. In 2001, Byrd&#x27;s lynching-by-dragging led the state of Texas to pass a hate crimes law, which later led the United States Congress to pass the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009. Brewer was executed by lethal injection for his part in the murder on September 21, 2011. King was executed by lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas, on April 24, 2019. Berry was sentenced to life imprisonment and will be eligible for parole in 2038.

==Background==
James Byrd Jr. was born on May 2, 1949, in Beaumont, Texas, the third of nine children, to Stella Mae Sharp and James Byrd Sr. His mother was a Sunday School teacher and his father was a deacon at the Greater New Bethel Church. Byrd graduated from Jasper Rowe High School in 1967, the last segregated class. After graduating from high school, he married and had three children: Renee, Ross, and Jamie. Between 1969 and 1996, Byrd was incarcerated several times for various offenses, including theft, forgery, and violation of parole. He worked as a vacuum salesman. Byrd was a cousin of Dennetta Lyles King, who was Rodney King&#x27;s first wife and mother to his daughter Lora King.

Ross Byrd, the only son of Byrd, has been involved with &quot;Murder Victims&#x27; Families for Reconciliation&quot;, an organization that opposes capital punishment. He campaigned to spare the lives of those who murdered his father and appeared briefly in the documentary &quot;Deadline&quot;.

==Murder==
On June 7, 1998, Byrd, age 49, accepted a ride from Shawn Berry (age 23), Lawrence Brewer (age 31), and John King (age 23). Berry, who was driving, was acquainted with Byrd from around town. Instead of taking Byrd home, the three men took Byrd to a remote county road out of town, beat him severely, spray-painted his face, urinated and defecated on him, and chained him by his ankles to their pickup truck before dragging him for about on Huff Creek Road (County Road 278). Brewer later claimed that Byrd&#x27;s throat had been slashed by Berry before he was dragged. However, forensic evidence suggests that Byrd had been attempting to keep his head up while being dragged, and an autopsy suggested that Byrd was alive during much of the dragging. Byrd died about halfway along the route of his dragging, when his right arm and head were severed as his body hit a culvert. While almost all of Byrd&#x27;s ribs were fractured, his brain and skull were found intact, further suggesting that he maintained consciousness while he was being dragged.

Berry, Brewer, and King dumped the mutilated remains of Byrd&#x27;s body in front of an African-American cemetery on Huff Creek Road, then drove off to a barbecue. A motorist found Byrd&#x27;s decapitated remains the following morning. Along the area where Byrd was dragged, police found a wrench with &quot;Berry&quot; written on it. They also found a lighter that was inscribed with &quot;Possum&quot;, which was King&#x27;s prison nickname. The police found 81 places that included portions of Byrd&#x27;s remains. Since Brewer and King were well-known white supremacists, it was determined by state law enforcement officials that the murder was a hate crime. They called upon the Federal Bureau of Investigation less than 24 hours after the discovery of Byrd&#x27;s remains. The special agent in charge of the FBI&#x27;s Houston office said that they were assisting because of the case&#x27;s &quot;extreme circumstances&quot;.

Berry, Brewer, and King were tried and convicted for Byrd&#x27;s murder. Brewer and King received the death penalty, while Berry was sentenced to life in prison. Brewer was executed by lethal injection on September 21, 2011, and King was executed on April 24, 2019.

==Perpetrators==

===Shawn Berry===
During the trial of Shawn Allen Berry (born February 12, 1975), the prosecution conceded that he was not a white supremacist, but they argued that he was just as responsible for Byrd&#x27;s murder as the other men and suggested that he might have been a thrill killer. Berry&#x27;s attorneys had three black men who knew him testify that he was not a racist. Berry claimed that Brewer and King were almost entirely responsible for the crime. He said he tried to stop them from attacking Byrd until Brewer threatened to do the same to him. Brewer, however, testified that Berry had cut Byrd&#x27;s throat before he was tied to the truck. The jury decided that minimal evidence supported this claim. Berry was also the only one of the three to show any degree of remorse. As a result, Berry was sentenced to life in prison rather than death. , Berry was living in protective custody at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice&#x27;s Ramsey Unit, and he will first be eligible for parole in June 2038, by that time, he will be 63 years old. He spends 23 hours per day in a cell measuring , with one hour for exercise. Berry married Christie Marcontell by proxy.

===Lawrence Brewer===
Lawrence Russell Brewer (March 13, 1967 – September 21, 2011) was a white supremacist who prior to Byrd&#x27;s murder had served a prison sentence for drug possession and burglary. He was paroled in 1991. After violating his parole conditions in 1994, Brewer was returned to prison. According to his court testimony, he joined a white supremacist prison gang with King in order to safeguard himself from other inmates. Brewer and King became friends in the Beto Unit prison. A psychiatrist testified that Brewer did not appear repentant for his crimes. During the trial, the prosecution labeled him a racist psychopath. Brewer was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death. Brewer, TDCJ#999327, was on death row at the Polunsky Unit, but he was executed in the Huntsville Unit on September 21, 2011. The day before his execution, Brewer expressed no remorse for his crime, as he told KHOU 11 News in Houston: &quot;As far as any regrets, no, I have no regrets. No, I&#x27;d do it all over again, to tell you the truth.&quot;

Before his execution, Brewer ordered a large and extensive last meal that prompted the end of last meal requests in Texas. The meal included two chicken fried steaks with gravy and sliced onions; a triple-patty bacon cheeseburger; a cheese omelet with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers and jalapeños; a bowl of fried okra with ketchup; one pound of barbecued meat with half a loaf of white bread; three fully loaded fajitas; a meat-lover&#x27;s pizza; one pint of Blue Bell vanilla ice cream; a slab of peanut-butter fudge with crushed peanuts on top; and three root beers. When the meal was presented, he told officials that he was not hungry and as a result he did not eat any of it. The meal was discarded, prompting State Senator John Whitmire to ask Texas prison officials to end the 87-year-old tradition of giving last meals to condemned inmates. The prison agency&#x27;s executive director responded by stating that the practice had been terminated effective immediately.

===John King===
John William &quot;Bill&quot; King (November 3, 1974 – April 24, 2019) was Berry&#x27;s longtime friend. He was accused of beating Byrd with a bat and then dragging him behind a pickup truck until he died. King, who prior to the murder had recently been released from a Texas prison, said that he had been repeatedly gang raped in prison by black inmates. He was found guilty and sentenced to death for his role in Byrd&#x27;s kidnapping and murder, and was on death row at the Polunsky Unit.

King had several racist tattoos: a black man hanging from a tree, Nazi symbols, the words &quot;Aryan Pride&quot;, and the patch for a gang of white supremacist inmates known as the Confederate Knights of America. In a jailhouse letter to Brewer that was intercepted by jail officials, King expressed pride in the crime and said that he realized while committing the murder that he might have to die. &quot;Regardless of the outcome of this, we have made history. Death before dishonor. &quot;Sieg Heil!&quot; &quot; King wrote. An officer investigating the case also testified that witnesses said that King had referred to &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; after beating Byrd.

On December 21, 2018, King&#x27;s execution by lethal injection was scheduled for April 24, 2019. On April 22, 2019, his appeals to both the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles were denied. He was executed at the Huntsville Unit on April 24, 2019.


==Reactions==
Numerous aspects of the Byrd murder echo lynching traditions that were common in the post-Civil War south. These include mutilation or decapitation and revelry, such as a barbecue or a picnic, either during or after a lynching. Byrd&#x27;s murder was strongly condemned by Jesse Jackson and the Martin Luther King Center as an act of vicious racism. It also focused national attention on the prevalence of white supremacist prison gangs.

Three sisters of Byrd are Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and in a joint statement said: &quot;Having a loved one tortured and lynched produced an unimaginable sense of loss and pain. How does one respond to such a brutal act? Retaliation, hateful speech, or promotion of hate-ridden propaganda never entered our mind. We thought: &#x27;What would Jesus have done? How would he have responded?&#x27; The answer was crystal clear. His message would have been one of peace and hope.&quot;

The victim&#x27;s family created the James Byrd Foundation for Racial Healing after his death. Basketball star Dennis Rodman paid their funeral expenses and gave Byrd&#x27;s family $25,000. Fight promoter Don King gave Byrd&#x27;s children $100,000 to be put towards their educational expenses. On the 25th anniversary of Byrd&#x27;s death, family members reflected in a 2023 interview for the &quot;Texas Tribune&quot; that fundraising for the foundation had become much harder as knowledge of Byrd&#x27;s murder fades; one sister reflected that there was less awareness amongst the public of hatred in the community: &quot;People don&#x27;t want to fund it because they think there&#x27;s no hate in the world&quot;, she was quoted as saying. A reporter visiting Jasper in 2018 noted that several residents denied Byrd&#x27;s death had any relation to racism or hate crimes. Writing for the &quot;Pacific Standard&quot; magazine, John Savage said: 

On October 7, 1998, an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; titled &quot;DWB&quot; (driving while black) referenced the murder within the plot. Instead of three white supremacists, however, the killers were three white New York City police officers. As the plot goes, the officers stop and arrest a black man for no reason, and then proceed to drag him to his death, after tying him to the car.

In 1999, the documentary &quot;Journey to a Hate Free Millennium&quot; was released, showcasing three United States hate crimes: the shootings at Columbine High School; the death of a gay student, Matthew Shepard; and the murder of Byrd. The same year, the city of Jasper named a local park the &quot;James Byrd Jr. Memorial Park&quot; in his honor.

In 2003, a movie about the crime, titled &quot;Jasper, Texas&quot;, was produced and aired on Showtime. The same year, a documentary titled &quot;Two Towns of Jasper&quot;, made by filmmakers Marco Williams and Whitney Dow, premiered on PBS&#x27;s &quot;P.O.V.&quot; series.

While employed as a radio DJ at station WARW in Washington, DC, Doug Tracht (also known as the &quot;Greaseman&quot;) made a derogatory comment referring to Byrd after playing Lauryn Hill&#x27;s song &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;. The February 1999 incident proved catastrophic to Tracht&#x27;s radio career, igniting protests from black and white listeners alike. He was quickly fired from WARW and lost his position as a volunteer deputy sheriff in Falls Church, Virginia.

In May 2004, two white teens, Joshua Lee Talley and John Matthew Fowler, were arrested and charged with criminal mischief for desecrating Byrd&#x27;s grave with racial slurs and profanities. According to a 2023 report in the &quot;Texas Tribune&quot;, Byrd&#x27;s grave has been desecrated on at least one other occasion; as a result of the desecrations, his family had a gated iron-railing enclosure placed around it.

===Effect on US politics===
Some advocacy groups, such as the NAACP National Voter Fund, made an issue of this case during George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2000. They accused Bush of implicit racism, since as governor of Texas, he opposed hate-crime legislation. Also, citing a prior commitment, Bush did not appear at Byrd&#x27;s funeral. Because two of the three murderers were sentenced to death and the third murderer was sentenced to life in prison (all three of them were charged with and convicted of capital murder, the highest felony level in Texas), Governor Bush maintained, &quot;we don&#x27;t need &quot;tougher&quot; laws&quot;. The 77th Texas Legislature passed the James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act. With the signature of Governor Rick Perry, who inherited the balance of Bush&#x27;s unexpired term, the act became Texas state law in 2001. In 2009, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes which are motivated by a victim&#x27;s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.

===Musical and poetry tributes===
On the 2001 album &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; by singer-songwriter Lori McKenna, the song &quot;Pink Sweater&quot; is dedicated to Byrd; it condemns his murderers and references their death-penalty convictions with the raucous refrain, &quot;I&#x27;ll be the one in the pink sweater, dancing around when you&#x27;re gone.&quot; In 2010, Alabama musician Matthew Mayfield wrote, recorded, and released a song in Byrd&#x27;s honor. The tune, titled &quot;Still Alive&quot;, is the fourth track on Mayfield&#x27;s EP &quot;You&#x27;re Not Home&quot;. &quot;Still Alive&quot; clearly related a stark bitterness towards racism and equated such hate crimes with genocide. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, featuring Mary J. Blige, mentions Byrd on Will Smith&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Lost and Found&quot;. Byrd&#x27;s son Ross recorded the rap album &quot;Undeniable Resurrection&quot; and dedicated it to his father.

&quot;Jasper&quot;, by Confrontation Camp, is the fifth track on the album &quot;Objects in the Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear&quot; (2000). &quot;Guitar Drag&quot; by sound artist Christian Marclay is a video- and sound-installation about the murder of James Byrd, in which a guitar was hooked to the back of a truck and dragged down a road, producing feedback and noise. &quot;I Heard &#x27;Em Say&quot; by Ryan Bingham is about Byrd&#x27;s murder and the racially charged climate around Jasper following the crime (2012).

Byrd&#x27;s murder is the subject of Lucille Clifton&#x27;s poem &quot;jasper texas 1998&quot;.

The Geto Boys track &quot;Eye 4 An Eye&quot; from &quot;Da Good da Bad &amp; da Ugly&quot; refers to Byrd&#x27;s manner of death in its second verse.

The story of Byrd&#x27;s murder, and that of Matthew Shepard, are told in a verse of the song &quot;Trouble the Waters&quot; by Big Country on their album &quot;Driving to Damascus&quot; (named &quot;John Wayne&#x27;s Dream&quot; in its US release).

Byrd&#x27;s murder is depicted in Nia DaCosta&#x27;s 2021 film &quot;Candyman&quot;, featuring him resurrected as one of the souls trapped in the Candyman &quot;hive&quot;: in his Candyman form, with his skull exposed, Byrd uses the hook and cables involved in his murder to kill his murderers, ascending into legend. Depicted in the film&#x27;s mid-credits scene in the form of shadow puppetry, Byrd&#x27;s murder was previously featured in DaCosta&#x27;s 2020 promotional short film of the same name. Before that, the murder had been depicted in the film &quot;Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV&quot; which was filmed a year after the murder.

<doc id="214393" wikidata="Q5943" url="?curid=214393" title="St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna">
<text>St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral ( ) is a Roman Catholic church in Vienna, Austria, and the mother church of the Archdiocese of Vienna. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Vienna, Christoph Schönborn. 

The current Romanesque and Gothic form of the cathedral, seen today in the Stephansplatz, was largely initiated by Duke Rudolf IV (1339–1365) and stands on the ruins of two earlier churches, the first a parish church consecrated in 1147. The most important religious building in Vienna, St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in Habsburg and Austrian history and has, with its multi-coloured tile roof, become one of the city&#x27;s most recognizable symbols. It has 256 stairs from the top to the bottom 

==History==
By the middle of the 12th century, Vienna had become an important centre of German civilization, and the four existing churches, including only one parish church, no longer met the town&#x27;s religious needs. In 1137, Bishop of Passau Reginmar and Margrave Leopold IV signed the Treaty of Mautern, which referred to Vienna as a &quot;civitas&quot; for the first time and transferred St. Peter&#x27;s Church to the Diocese of Passau. Under the treaty, Margrave Leopold IV also received from the bishop extended stretches of land beyond the city walls, with the notable exception of the territory allocated for the new parish church, which would eventually become St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral. Although previously believed built in an open field outside the city walls, the new parish church was in actuality likely built on an ancient cemetery dating to Ancient Roman times; excavations for a heating system in 2000 revealed graves below the surface, which were carbon-dated to the 4th century. This discovery suggests that an even older religious building on this site predated the St. Rupert&#x27;s Church, which is considered the oldest church in Vienna.
Founded in 1137 following the Treaty of Mautern, the partially constructed Romanesque church was solemnly dedicated in 1147 to Saint Stephen in the presence of Conrad III of Germany, Bishop Otto of Freising, and other German nobles who were about to embark on the Second Crusade. Although the first structure was completed in 1160, major reconstruction and expansion lasted until 1511, and repair and restoration projects continue to the present day. From 1230 to 1245, the initial Romanesque structure was extended westward; the present-day west wall and Romanesque towers date from this period. In 1258, however, a great fire destroyed much of the original building, and a larger replacement structure, also Romanesque in style and reusing the two towers, was constructed over the ruins of the old church and consecrated 23 April 1263. The anniversary of this second consecration is commemorated each year by a rare ringing of the Pummerin bell for three minutes in the evening.

In 1304, King Albert I ordered a Gothic three-nave choir to be constructed east of the church, wide enough to meet the tips of the old transepts. Under his son Duke Albert II, work continued on the Albertine choir, which was consecrated in 1340 on the 77th anniversary of the previous consecration. The middle nave is largely dedicated to St. Stephen and All Saints, while the north and south nave, are dedicated to St. Mary and the Apostles respectively. Duke Rudolf IV, &quot;the Founder&quot;, Albert II&#x27;s son, expanded the choir again to increase the religious clout of Vienna. On 7 April 1359, Rudolf IV laid the cornerstone for a westward Gothic extension of the Albertine choir in the vicinity of the present south tower. This expansion would eventually encapsulate the entirety of the old church, and in 1430, the edifice of the old church was removed from within as work progressed on the new cathedral. The south tower was completed in 1433, and vaulting of the nave took place from 1446 to 1474. The foundation for a north tower was laid in 1450, and construction began under master Lorenz Spenning, but its construction was abandoned when major work on the cathedral ceased in 1511.
In 1365, just six years after beginning the Gothic extension of the Albertine choir, Rudolf IV disregarded St. Stephen&#x27;s status as a mere parish church and presumptuously established a chapter of canons befitting a large cathedral. This move was only the first step in fulfilling Vienna&#x27;s long-held desire to obtain its own diocese; in 1469, Emperor Frederick III prevailed upon Pope Paul II to grant Vienna its own bishop, to be appointed by the emperor. Despite long-standing resistance by the Bishops of Passau, who did not wish to lose control of the area, the Diocese of Vienna was canonically established on 18 January 1469, with St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral as its mother church. In 1722 during the reign of Emperor Charles VI, Pope Innocent XIII elevated the see to an archbishopric.

During World War II, the cathedral was saved from intentional destruction at the hands of retreating German forces when &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; Captain Gerhard Klinkicht disregarded orders from the city commandant, &quot;Sepp&quot; Dietrich, to &quot;fire a hundred shells and reduce it to rubble&quot;. On 12 April 1945, civilian looters lit fires in nearby shops as Soviet Army troops entered the city. The winds carried the fire to the cathedral, where it severely damaged the roof, causing it to collapse. Fortunately, protective brick shells built around the pulpit, Frederick III&#x27;s tomb, and other treasures, minimized damage to the most valuable artworks. However, the Rollinger choir stalls, carved in 1487, could not be saved. Reconstruction began immediately after the war, with a limited reopening 12 December 1948 and a full reopening 23 April 1952.

==Exterior==
The church was dedicated to St. Stephen, also the patron of the bishop&#x27;s cathedral in Passau, and so was oriented toward the sunrise on his feast day of 26 December, as the position stood in the year that construction began. Built of limestone, the cathedral is long, wide, and tall at its highest point. Over the centuries, soot and other forms of air pollution accumulating on the church have given it a black colour, but recent restoration projects have again returned some portions of the building to their original white.

===Towers===

Standing at tall and affectionately referred to by the city&#x27;s inhabitants as &quot;Steffl&quot; (a diminutive form of &quot;Stephen&quot;), St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral&#x27;s massive south tower is its highest point and a dominant feature of the Vienna skyline. Its construction lasted 65 years, from 1368 to 1433. During the Siege of Vienna in 1529 and again during the Battle of Vienna in 1683, it served as the main observation and command post for the defence of the walled city, and it even contains an apartment for the watchmen who, until 1955, manned the tower at night and rang the bells if a fire was spotted in the city. At the tip of the tower stands the double-eagle imperial emblem with the Habsburg-Lorraine coat of arms on its chest, surmounted by a double-armed apostolic cross, which refers to &quot;Apostolic Majesty&quot;, the imperial style of kings of Hungary. This emblem replaced earlier crescent and the six-pointed star emblem. The original emblem, as well as a couple of later ones, today can be seen at the Vienna City Museum.

The north tower was originally intended to mirror the south tower, but the design proved too ambitious, considering the era of Gothic cathedrals was nearing its end, and construction was halted in 1511. In 1578, the tower-stump was augmented with a Renaissance cap, nicknamed the &quot;water tower top&quot; by the Viennese. The tower now stands at tall, roughly half the height of the south tower.

The main entrance to the church is named the Giant&#x27;s Door, or &quot;Riesentor&quot;, possibly referring to the thighbone of a mammoth that hung over it for decades after being unearthed in 1443 while digging the foundations for the north tower, or else to the funnel shape of the door, from the Middle High German word &quot;risen&quot;, meaning &#x27;sink or &#x27;fall&#x27;. The tympanum above the Giant&#x27;s Door depicts Christ Pantocrator flanked by two winged angels, while on the left and right are the two Roman Towers, or &quot;Heidentürme&quot;, that each stand at approximately tall. The name for the towers derives from the fact that they were constructed from the rubble of old structures built by the Romans (German &quot;Heiden&quot; meaning heathens or pagans) during their occupation of the area. Square at the base and octagonal above the roofline, the &quot;Heidentürme&quot; originally housed bells; those in the south tower were lost during World War II, but the north tower remains an operational bell tower. The Roman Towers, together with the Giant&#x27;s Door, are the oldest parts of the church.

===Roof===


The glory of St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral is its ornately patterned, richly coloured roof, long, and covered by 230,000 glazed tiles. Above the choir on the south side of the building the tiles form a mosaic of the double-headed eagle that is symbolic of the empire ruled from Vienna by the Habsburg dynasty. On the north side, the coats of arms of the City of Vienna and of the Republic of Austria are depicted. In 1945, fire caused by World War II damage to nearby buildings leapt to the north tower of the cathedral and destroyed the wooden framework of the roof. Replicating the original bracing for so large a roof (it rises 38 metres above the floor) would have been cost-prohibitive, so over 600 metric tons of steel bracing were used instead. The roof is so steep that it is sufficiently cleaned by the rain alone and is seldom covered by snow.

===Bells===
Composer Ludwig van Beethoven discovered the totality of his deafness when he saw birds flying out of the bell tower as a result of the bells&#x27; tolling but could not hear the bells. St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral has 22 bells in total. The largest is officially named for St. Mary, but usually called &quot;Pummerin&quot; (&quot;Boomer&quot;) and hangs in the north tower. At , it is the largest in Austria and the second-largest swinging bell in Europe after the &quot;Peter&quot; in Cologne Cathedral).
Originally cast in 1711 from cannons captured from the Muslim invaders by bell founder Johann Achammer, it was recast (partly from its original metal) in 1951 after crashing onto the floor when its wooden cradle burned during the 1945 fire. The new bell has a diameter of and was a gift from the province of Upper Austria. It sounds on only a few special occasions each year, including the arrival of the new year. Also in this tower are two (formerly three) older bells that are no longer used:
&quot;Kleine Glocke&quot; (&quot;small bell&quot;) () cast around 1280;
&quot;Speisglocke&quot; (&quot;dinner bell&quot;) () cast in 1746;
and &quot;Zügenglocke&quot; (&quot;processions bell&quot;) () cast in 1830. However, the Kleine Glocke was restored at the Grassmayr foundry in Innsbruck in 2017 and rehung in the North Roman Tower.
A peal of eleven electrically operated bells, cast in 1960, hangs in the soaring south tower. Replacements for other ancient bells also lost in the 1945 fire, they are used during Masses at the cathedral: four are used for an ordinary Mass; the quantity increases to as many as ten for a major holiday Mass; and the eleventh and largest is added when the archbishop of Vienna himself is present. Also in this tallest tower are the &quot;Primglocke&quot; (recast in 1772), which rings on the quarter hour, and the &quot;Uhrschälle&quot; (cast in 1449), which rings on the hour.

The north Roman Tower contains six bells, four of which were cast in 1772, that ring for evening prayers and toll for funerals. They are working bells of the cathedral and their names usually recall their original uses: &quot;Feuerin&quot; (&quot;fire alarm&quot; but now used as a call to evening prayers) cast in 1879; &quot;Kantnerin&quot; (calling the cantors (musicians) to Mass); &quot;Feringerin&quot; (used for High Mass on Sundays); &quot;Bieringerin&quot; (&quot;beer ringer&quot; for last call at taverns); &quot;Poor Souls&quot; (the funeral bell); &quot;Churpötsch&quot; (donated by the local curia in honour of the Maria Pötsch icon in the cathedral), and Kleine Glocke (cast in 1280 and is the oldest bell in the cathedral).

The 1945 fire destroyed the bells that hung in the south Roman Tower.
===Fixtures on the outside walls===

During the Middle Ages, major cities had their own set of measures and the public availability of these standards allowed visiting merchants to comply with local regulations. The official Viennese ell length standards for verifying the measure of different types of cloth sold are embedded in the cathedral wall, to the left of the main entrance. The linen , also called Viennese yard, () and the drapery () length standards consist of two iron bars. According to Franz Twaroch, the ratio between the linen ell and the drapery ell is exactly formula_1. The Viennese ells are mentioned for the first time in 1685 by the Canon Testarello della Massa in his book &quot;Beschreibung der ansehnlichen und berühmten St. Stephans-Domkirchen&quot;.
A memorial tablet (near location SJC on the Plan below) gives a detailed account of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s relationship with the cathedral, including the fact that he had been appointed an adjunct music director here shortly before his death. This was his parish church when he lived at the &quot;Figaro House&quot; and he was married here, two of his children were baptised here, and his funeral was held in the Chapel of the Cross (at location PES) inside.

Adjacent to the catacomb entrance is the Capistran Chancel, the pulpit (now outdoors at location SJC) from which St. John Capistrano and Hungarian general John Hunyadi preached a crusade in 1456 to repel Muslim invasions of Christian Europe. (See: Siege of Belgrade). The 18th century Baroque statue shows the Franciscan friar under an extravagant sunburst, trampling on a beaten Turk. This was the original cathedral&#x27;s main pulpit inside until it was replaced by Niclaes Gerhaert van Leyden&#x27;s pulpit in 1515.

A figure of Christ (at location CT) is known affectionately to the Viennese as &quot;Christ with a toothache&quot; (de:Zahnwehherrgott). At the southwest corner (location S) are various memorials from when the area outside the cathedral was a cemetery, as well as a recently restored 15th-century sundial on a flying buttress.

==Interior==
===Altars===
The main part of the church contains 18 altars, with more in the various chapels. The High Altar (HA) and the Wiener Neustadt Altar () (WNA) are the most famous.

The first focal point of any visitor is the distant High Altar, built over seven years from 1641 to 1647 as part of the first refurbishment of the cathedral in the baroque style. The altar was built by Tobias Pock at the direction of Vienna&#x27;s Bishop Philipp Friedrich Graf Breuner with marble from Poland, Styria and Tyrol. The High Altar represents the stoning of the church&#x27;s patron St. Stephen. It is framed by figures of patron saints from the surrounding areas – Saints Leopold, Florian, Sebastian and Rochus – and surmounted with a statue of St. Mary which draws the beholder&#x27;s eye to a glimpse of heaven where Christ waits for Stephen (the first martyr) to ascend from below.
The Wiener Neustädter Altar at the head of the north nave was ordered in 1447 by Emperor Frederick III, whose tomb is located in the opposite direction. On the predella is his famous A.E.I.O.U. device. Frederick ordered it for the Cistercian Viktring Abbey (near Klagenfurt) where it remained until the abbey was closed in 1786 as part of Emperor Joseph II&#x27;s anti-clerical reforms. It was then sent to the Cistercian monastery of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (founded by Emperor Frederick III) in the city of Wiener Neustadt, and finally sold in 1885 to St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral when the Wiener Neustadt monastery was closed after merging with Heiligenkreuz Abbey.

The Wiener Neustädter Altar is composed of two triptychs, the upper being four times taller than the lower one. When the lower panels are opened, the Gothic grate of the former reliquary depot above the altar is revealed. On weekdays, the four panels are closed and display a drab painted scene involving 72 saints. On Sundays, the panels are opened showing gilded wooden figures depicting events in the life of the Virgin Mary. Restoration began on its 100th anniversary, in 1985 and took 20 years, 10 art restorers, 40,000 man-hours, and €1.3 million to complete, primarily because its large surface area of .

===Máriapócs Icon===

The Maria Pötsch Icon (MP) is a Byzantine style icon of St. Mary with the child Jesus. The icon takes its name from the Hungarian Byzantine Catholic shrine of Máriapócs (pronounced &quot;Poach&quot;), whence it was transferred to Vienna. The picture shows the Virgin Mary pointing to the child (signifying &quot;He is the way&quot;) and the child holding a three-stemmed rose (symbolizing the Holy Trinity) and wearing a prescient cross from his neck. The 50 x 70 cm icon was commissioned in 1676 from painter István Papp by László Csigri upon his release as a prisoner of war from the Turks who were invading Hungary at the time. As Csigri was unable to pay the 6-forint fee the icon was bought by Lőrinc Hurta who donated it to the church of Pócs.

After claims of two miraculous incidents in 1696 with the mother in the picture allegedly shedding real tears, Emperor Leopold I ordered it brought to St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, where it would be safe from the Muslim armies that still controlled much of Hungary. Upon its arrival after a triumphal five-month journey in 1697, Empress Eleonora Magdalena commissioned the splendid &quot;Rosa Mystica&quot; oklad and framework (now one of several) for it, and the Emperor personally ordered the icon placed near the High Altar in the front of the church, where it stood prominently from 1697 until 1945. Since then, it has been in a different framework, above an altar under a medieval stone baldachin near the southwest corner of the nave – where the many burning candles indicate the extent of its veneration, especially by Hungarians. Since its arrival the picture has not been seen weeping again but other miracles and answered prayers have been attributed to it, including Prince Eugene of Savoy&#x27;s victory over the Turks at Zenta few weeks after the icon&#x27;s installation in the Stephansdom.

The residents of Pócs wanted their holy miracle-working painting returned, but the emperor sent them a copy instead. Since then, the copy has been reported to weep real tears and work miracles, so the village changed its name from merely &quot;Pócs&quot; to &quot;Máriapócs&quot; and has become an important pilgrimage site.

===Pulpit===

The stone pulpit is a masterwork of late Gothic sculpture. Long attributed to Anton Pilgram, today Niclaes Gerhaert van Leyden is thought more likely to be the carver. So that the local language sermon could be better heard by the worshipers in the days before microphones and loudspeakers, the pulpit stands against a pillar out in the nave, instead of in the chancel at the front of the church.

The sides of the pulpit erupt like stylized petals from the stem supporting it. On those Gothic petals are relief portraits of the four original Doctors of the Church (St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Ambrose, St. Gregory the Great and St. Jerome), each of them in one of four different temperaments and in one of four different stages of life. The handrail of the stairway curving its way around the pillar from ground level to the pulpit has fantastic decorations of toads and lizards biting each other, symbolizing the fight of good against evil. At the top of the stairs, a stone puppy protects the preacher from intruders.

Beneath the stairs is one of the most beloved symbols of the cathedral: a stone self-portrait of the unknown sculptor gawking (German: &quot;gucken&quot;) out of a window (German: &quot;fenster&quot;) and thus famously known as the &quot;Fenstergucker&quot;. The chisel in the subject&#x27;s hand, and the stonemason&#x27;s signature mark on the shield above the window led to the speculation that it could be a self-portrait of the sculptor.

===Chapels===

There are several formal chapels in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral:
* St. Catherine&#x27;s Chapel, in the base of the south tower, is the baptismal chapel. The 14-sided baptismal font was completed in 1481, and its cover was formerly the soundboard above the famed pulpit in the main church. Its marble base shows the four Evangelists, while the niches of the basin feature the twelve apostles, Christ and St. Stephan.
* St. Barbara&#x27;s Chapel, in the base of the north tower, is used for meditation and prayer.
* St. Eligius&#x27;s Chapel, in the southeast corner, is open for prayer. The altar is dedicated to St. Valentine whose body (one of three, held by various churches) is in another chapel, upstairs.
* St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Chapel, above St. Eligius&#x27; Chapel, has recently been restored.
* The Chapel of the Cross (PES), in the northeast corner, holds the burial place of Prince Eugene of Savoy in the vault containing 3 coffins and a heart urn, under a massive stone slab with iron rings. The funeral of Mozart occurred here on 6 December 1791. The beard on the crucified Christ above the altar is of real hair. The chapel is not open to the public.
* St. Valentine&#x27;s Chapel, above the Chapel of the Cross, is the current depository of the hundreds of relics belonging to the &quot;Stephansdom&quot;, including a piece of the tablecloth from the Last Supper. A large chest holds the bones of St. Valentine that were moved here about a century ago, from what is now the Chapter House to the south of the High Altar.

===Tombs, catacombs, and crypts===

Since its earliest days, the cathedral has been surrounded by cemeteries dating back to Roman times, and has sheltered the bodies of nobles and commoners. It has always been an honour to be buried inside a church, close to the physical presence of the saints whose relics are preserved there. Those less honoured were buried near, but outside, the church.

Inside the cathedral are the tombs of Prince Eugene of Savoy (PES), commander of the Imperial forces during the War of the Spanish Succession in the &quot;Chapel of The Cross&quot; (northwest corner of the cathedral) and of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (Fr3), under whose reign the Diocese of Vienna was canonically erected on 18 January 1469, in the Apostles&#x27; Choir (southeast corner of the cathedral).
The construction of Emperor Frederick&#x27;s tomb spanned over 45 years, starting 25 years before his death. The impressive sarcophagus is made of the unusually dense red marble-like stone found at the Adnet quarry. Carved by Niclaes Gerhaert van Leyden, the tomb lid shows Emperor Frederick in his coronation regalia surrounded by the coats of arms of all of his dominions. The body of the tomb has 240 statues and is a glory of medieval sculptural art.

When the charnel house and eight cemeteries abutting the cathedral&#x27;s side and back walls closed due to an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1735, the bones within them were moved to the catacombs below the church. Burials directly in the catacombs occurred until 1783 when a new law forbade most burials within the city. The remains of over 11,000 persons are in the catacombs (which may be toured).

The basement of the cathedral also hosts the Bishops, Provosts and Ducal crypts. The most recent interment in the Bishop&#x27;s crypt completed in 1952 under the south choir was that of 98-year-old Cardinal Franz König in 2004. Provosts of the cathedral are buried in another chamber. Other members of the cathedral chapter are now buried in a special section at the Zentralfriedhof.

The Ducal Crypt located under the chancel holds 78 bronze containers with the bodies, hearts, or viscera of 72 members of the Habsburg dynasty. Before his death in 1365, Duke Rudolf IV ordered the crypt built for his remains in the new cathedral he commissioned. By 1754, the small rectangular chamber was overcrowded with 12 sarcophagi and 39 urns, so the area was expanded with an oval chamber added to the east end of the rectangular one. In 1956, the two chambers were renovated and their contents rearranged. The sarcophagi of Duke Rudolf IV and his wife were placed upon a pedestal and the 62 urns containing organs were moved from the two rows of shelves around the new chamber to cabinets in the original one.
===Organs===
St Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral has an old organ tradition. The first organ is mentioned in 1334. After the 1945 fire, Michael Kauffmann finished a large electric action pipe organ in 1960 with 125 stops and 4 manuals, financed with public donations. In 1991, the Austrian firm of Rieger rebuilt the choir organ. It is a mechanical organ, with 56 voices and 4 manuals.

The Kauffmann organ at the west end was only used for about 35 years before falling into disuse. In 2017-2020 the Austrian firm of Rieger rebuilt the west end (Riesenorgel) organ using the 1960 facade and some old pipework and this resulted in an organ of 5 manuals with 130 stops. The choir organ has its own console but there is a separate console, built 2017-2020 and comprising 5 manuals with 185 stops, from which the Riesenorgel and choir organ can be played at the same time. In addition to the Riesenorgel and choir organ the Cathedral also has 3 smaller instruments.

==Conservation and restoration==
Preservation and repair of the fabric of the medieval cathedral has been a continuous process at St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral since its original construction in 1147.

The porous limestone is subject to weathering, but coating it with a sealer like silicone would simply trap moisture inside the stone and cause it to crack faster when the water freezes.
The permanent &quot;Dombauhütte&quot; (Construction Department) uses the latest scientific techniques (including laser cleaning of delicate features on stonework), and is investigating a process that would impregnate the cavities within the stone with something that would keep water from having a place to infiltrate.

The most visible current repair project is a multi-year renovation of the tall south tower, for which scaffolding has been installed. Fees from advertising on the netting around the scaffolding were defraying some of the costs of the work, but the concept of such advertising was controversial and has been discontinued. As of December 2008, the majority of the restoration on the south tower has been finished, and most scaffolding removed.
Systematic cleaning of the interior is gradually proceeding around the walls, and an outdoor relief of Christ in Gethsemane is being restored.

A major project has been recently completed for which visitors and worshippers in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral had been waiting since 1147: better heating of the church during the winter. Previous systems, including fireplaces, just deposited soot and grease on the artwork, but the new system uses apparatus in many different locations so that there is little moving airflow to carry damaging particles. The church is now heated to around .

Some of the architectural drawings date from the Middle Ages and are on paper 15 ft long and too fragile to handle. Laser measurements of the ancient cathedral have now been made so that a digital 3-dimensional virtual model of the cathedral now exists in its computers, and detailed modern plans can be output at will. When weathered stonework needs to be repaired or replaced, the computerized system can create life-sized models to guide the nine full-time stonemasons on staff in the on-site workshops against the north wall of the cathedral.

On 29 March 2014, a 37-year-old man vandalized the interior of the cathedral by pushing the statue of St. Jude Thaddeus from its marble base.

In November 2019, art historians discovered a mural under layers of dirt on the wall of what is now the cathedral&#x27;s gift shop. It is believed to be the work of the Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer.

==Stephansdom in popular culture==
As Vienna&#x27;s landmark, the St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral is featured in media including films, video games, and television shows. These include &quot;The Third Man&quot; and &quot;Burnout 3&quot;. The cathedral is also depicted on the Austrian 10 cent euro coins and on the packaging of the Manner-Schnitten wafer treat. The Archdiocese of Vienna allowed the Manner company to use the cathedral as its logo in return for funding the wages of one stonemason doing repair work on the cathedral. In 2008, Sarah Brightman performed a concert promoting her latest album, &quot;Symphony&quot;, which was recorded for a TV broadcast and a further DVD release in late September.

==Balassi Mass==
Since 2008, the two sabres of the Balint Balassi Memorial Sword Award, founded by Pal Molnar, have been blessed during a Balassi Mass held a few days before the award ceremony. On 25 January 2013, in the presence of some three hundred Hungarians, Bishop Laszlo Kiss-Rigo blessed the two swords during a Mass celebrated in the cathedral.

<doc id="214404" wikidata="Q712983" url="?curid=214404" title="National Assembly (Republic of China)">
<text>The National Assembly was the authoritative legislative body of the Republic of China, from 1947 to 2005. Along with the Control Yuan (upper house) and the Legislative Yuan (lower house), the National Assembly formed the tricameral parliament of the Republic of China.

Similar to other electoral colleges, the National Assembly had elected the President and Vice President under the 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China with the role of the constituent assembly that aimed to amend the country&#x27;s constitution.

The first National Assembly was elected in November 1947 and met in Nanjing in March 1948. However, in the next year, the Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China lost mainland China in the Civil War and retreated to Taiwan. The National Assembly resumed its meeting in Taipei in 1954. In the 1990s, its parliamentary powers were gradually transferred to the Legislative Yuan and direct democracy exercised by the &quot;de facto&quot; residents before constitutional amendments made it a dormant body in 2000 and &quot;de facto&quot; dissolved in 2005.

==History==
===Early Republican period===

Calls for a National Assembly were part of the platform of the revolutionaries who ultimately overthrew the Qing dynasty. In response, the Qing dynasty formed the first assembly in 1910, but it was virtually powerless and intended only as an advisory body. In the early Republican Era, the bicameral National Assembly was established by the Beiyang government. The design referred to the structure of the United States Congress as Senate () and House of Representatives (). However, the Warlord Era with the interference of military power toward the constitution suppressed the authority and the reputation of the National Assembly.

&quot;The Chinese social and political science review&quot; quoted the institution&#x27;s English name as &quot;National People&#x27;s Congress&quot; during the drafting of constitution.

===1947 Constitution===

In 1946, the Constituent Assembly promulgated a new constitution and the first National Assembly met in 1948 in Nanjing, the Chinese capital. Apart from the KMT, the only legal parties were the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party.

Under the constitution, the main duty of the National Assembly was to elect the President and Vice President for terms of six years. It also had the right to recall or impeach the President and Vice President if they failed to fulfill their political responsibilities. According to &quot;National Assembly Duties Act&quot;, the National Assembly could amend the constitution with a two-thirds majority, with at least three-quarters membership present, as well as to ratify constitutional amendments proposed by deputies of the Legislative Yuan. It could also change territorial boundaries. The responsibilities of the deputies of the Assembly, as well as of the Assembly as a whole, were derived from the directions of Sun Yat-sen. At that time the NA served as a counterpart to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, with a Presidium of the National Assembly governing over its activities.


In 1949, the Chinese Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War and mainland China became the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The National Assembly (along with the entire ROC government) was relocated to Taipei. The Assembly&#x27;s right to legislate was put into moratorium until at least half of all counties in the nation were again able to elect representatives via their County Assemblies.

The first National Assembly was to serve for a period of only six years. However, according to the Kuomintang (KMT) leadership, the fall of the Mainland made it impossible to hold new elections there, as all Mainland provinces were under &quot;Communist rebellion&quot;. As a result, the Judicial Yuan decided that the original members of the National Assembly representing Communist-controlled constituencies must continue to hold office until new elections could be held. National Assembly elections were still held in territories under ROC control.

In accordance with the 76th interpretation of the 1947 Constitution by the Judicial Yuan in 1957, the NA formed part of a three-chamber tricameral parliament together with the Legislative and Control Yuans and was the senior most chamber of parliament, with the latter two performing regular legislative work in the absence of the Assembly. During the years when it elected or recalled the president and vice president, it acted as an electoral college with all its county representatives serving as electors.

===Constitutional reforms in the 1990s===
As a result of this decision, the same National Assembly, elected in 1947, remained for 44 years until 1991, when as part of a constitutional ruling a Second National Assembly was elected. There was strong objection to the Assembly, which was derisively called the &quot;Ten-thousand-year Congress&quot; by critics.

Shortly after passing constitutional reforms in 1991, the National Assembly held direct elections in December. Following a 1994 constitutional amendment, the Assembly essentially became a permanent constituent assembly, as the Assembly&#x27;s other major role, to elect the President and Vice President of the Republic of China, was abolished. Direct elections for the president, vice president, and Assembly were held simultaneously in March 1996. However, these reforms granted it new functions, such as hearing the president&#x27;s State of the Nation Address and approving the president&#x27;s nominations of the grand justices and the heads of the Examination and Control Yuans. Following the assembly&#x27;s abolition, these functions are now in the hands of the Legislative Yuan.

In 1999, the Assembly passed constitutional amendments which would link its election and term with the Legislative Yuan. Part of these amendments&#x27; effect was to extend the term of both bodies, which was strongly criticized by the public. The People First Party was founded shortly after the 2000 presidential election. The two larger parties, the Kuomintang and Democratic Progressive Party, wished to bar the People First Party (PFP) from the National Assembly. As a result, the 2000 National Assembly elections were canceled, and delegates were to be selected &quot;ad hoc&quot; on the basis of proportional representation via special election within six months of the Legislative Yuan proposing constitutional amendments, calling for the impeachment of the president or vice president, or declaring a vote on changes to national borders. However, no such situation arose from 2000 to 2004, and the National Assembly never met during this period.

===Dissolution===
On 23 August 2004, the Legislative Yuan proposed a series of amendments that included dissolution of the National Assembly. The purpose of this proposal is to transfer power to ratify constitutional amendments and territorial amendments from the National Assembly to the people. Under the amendments, subsequent proposed amendments are to be approved by three-fourths of the present members in the Legislative Yuan, with at least three-fourths of all members present. It would then be promulgated for a period of 180 days and then submitted to a referendum, in which a simple majority of all eligible voters shall be sufficient to ratify the amendments. A Democratic Progressive Party proposal authorizing citizens&#x27; initiative rights to propose constitutional amendments was withdrawn after it became clear that such a proposal would not pass the Legislative Yuan. Opponents of such constitutional reforms argued that by eliminating the 3/4 legislative vote requirement, a relatively small number of voters could force a referendum on Taiwan independence which would trigger a crisis with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. By contrast, keeping the 3/4 legislative vote requirement would mean that any constitutional amendment would require a consensus among both the pan-green coalition and pan-blue coalition to be considered. The requirement that a majority of all voters approve the amendment allows for a party to block an amendment by boycotting the vote as was done with the referendums voted on alongside the March 2004 presidential elections.

Under the Constitution at the time, the National Assembly must then be elected to consider these amendments. Such consideration and eventual ratification of the constitutional amendments was originally considered to be a formality, but a number of unexpected complications occurred in 2005. The first was the poor showing of the People First Party (PFP) in the 2004 Legislative Yuan election. The PFP was widely expected to merge with the KMT, but PFP Chairman James Soong became disenchanted by the idea. The second was the reluctance of the Taiwan Solidarity Union to pass the amendments. These amendments were seen by some Taiwan independence supporters as a prelude to a later declaration of independence, but the results of the 2004 election made this very unlikely. Faced with this outcome, the TSU became very reluctant to support a reform that would make elections by small parties such as itself harder.

Another unexpected event occurred which gave the National Assembly elections on 14 May 2005 more significance than had been intended: the election was lined up immediately after trips to mainland China by KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong. This had the effect of turning the May 14 elections into an opinion poll on relations with mainland China which was undesired by the Democratic Progressive Party, though the DPP subsequently gained a plurality in the elections.

On 7 June 2005, the 300 delegates voted (by a majority of 249 to 48) the constitutional amendments into effect, and so dissolved the National Assembly until the &quot;unification of the country&quot; as stated in the preamble.

==Functions==
The National Assembly held the most important constitutional powers within the national organs under the 1947 constitution. All of its powers were transferred to the Legislative Yuan and direct democracy exercised by the citizens of the free area after a series of constitutional amendments as Additional Articles of the Constitution in the 1990s and early 2000s.

* Procedure for ratification of national territory alteration was changed to be proposed by Legislative Yuan and ratified by National Assembly elected after the proposal has been made in the 2000 amendment (6th), and then the final ratification power was transferred to the citizens of the free area in the 2005 amendment (7th).
* Power to elect President and the Vice President was transferred to the citizens of the free area in the 1992 amendment (2nd), and then further clarified to be in form of &quot;direct election&quot; in the 1994 amendment (3rd). See &quot;Presidential elections in Taiwan.&quot;
* Procedure to recall the President and the Vice President was changed to be proposed by the National Assembly and voted by the citizens of the free area in the 1994 amendment (3rd), and changed to be proposed by the Legislative Yuan and voted by the citizens of the free area in the 2000 amendment (6th).
* Procedure for ratification of constitutional amendment was changed to be proposed by Legislative Yuan and ratified by National Assembly elected after the proposal has been made in the 2000 amendment (6th), and then the final ratification power was transferred to the citizens of the free area in the 2005 amendment (7th).
* Procedure to impeach the President and the Vice President was changed to be proposed by the Legislative Yuan and voted by the National Assembly in the 1997 amendment (4th), and the final decision power was moved to be judged by the Justices of the Judicial Yuan in Constitutional Court in the 2005 amendment (7th).

The series of constitutional amendments coined the Additional Articles of the Constitution as the current fundamental law of Taiwan. During the evolution of the Additional Articles, the National Assembly also held the power to confirm some important governmental officers to maintain the separation of powers during the government reorganization.
==Elections and terms==

The Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan in 1949, two years after the first election was held in China. As Kuomintang insists to claim the sovereignty over the whole China, the term of the members were extended until &quot;re-election is possible in their original electoral district.&quot; In response to the increasing democracy movement in Taiwan, limited supplementary elections were held in Taiwan starting from 1969 and parts of Fujian from 1972. Members elected in these supplementary elections served together with the members who were elected in 1948. This situation remained until a Constitutional Court (Judicial Yuan) ruling on June 21, 1991, that ordered the retirement of all members with extended terms by the end of year 1991.

<doc id="214407" wikidata="Q2373098" url="?curid=214407" title="USS Leyte (CV-32)">
<text>USS &quot;Leyte&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-32, AVT-10) was one of 24 s built during and shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the third US Navy ship to bear the name. &quot;Leyte&quot; was commissioned in April 1946, too late to serve in World War II. She spent most of her career in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean, but also saw service in the Korean War, in which she earned two battle stars. She was reclassified in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), then as an Antisubmarine Aircraft Carrier (CVS), and finally (after inactivation) as an aircraft transport (AVT).

Unlike most of her sister ships, &quot;Leyte&quot; received no major modernizations, and thus throughout her career retained the classic appearance of a World War II &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship. She was decommissioned in 1959 and sold for scrap in 1970.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Leyte&quot; was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; ships. She was laid down as &quot;Crown Point&quot; on 21 February 1944 at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia, and renamed &quot;Leyte&quot; on 8 May 1945 to commemorate the recent Battle of Leyte Gulf. She was launched on 23 August, sponsored by Alice Dillon Mead, wife of U.S. Senator James M. Mead, and commissioned on 11 April 1946, with Captain Henry F. MacComsey in command.

==Service history==

&quot;Leyte&quot; joined battleship on a good will cruise along the western seaboard of South America in the fall of 1946 before returning to the Caribbean on 18 November to resume shakedown operations. In 1948, the carrier was equipped with its first helicopter detachment of HO3S-1 utility helicopters, and participated in a fleet exercise, &quot;Operation Frigid&quot;, in the North Atlantic.

In the years preceding the Korean War, the Leyte participated in numerous other fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean, trained naval reservists, and deployed four times to the Mediterranean: April–June 1947, July–November 1947, September 1949 – January 1950, and May–August 1950.

Beginning in September 1948, while in Guantanamo Bay, &quot;Leyte&quot; hosted a number of Air Force pilots for a month, cross-training for carrier-based operations. Notable pilots participating in those exercises included Kenneth O. Chilstrom and George I. Ruddell.

The deployment of &quot;Leyte&quot; to the Mediterranean in mid-1950 included a demonstration of airpower over Beirut, Lebanon, on 14 August, supporting the Middle East against communist pressure. &quot;Leyte&quot; returned to Norfolk on 24 August, and after two weeks of preparation, departed on 6 September to join Task Force 77 (TF 77) in the Far East to support United Nations Forces in Korea.

&quot;Leyte&quot; arrived at the Sasebo base for U.S. Fleet Activities in Sasebo, Japan, on 8 October 1950 and made final preparations for combat operations. From 9 October – 19 January 1951, the ship and her aircraft spent 92 days at sea and flew 3,933 sorties against North Korean forces. Her pilots accumulated 11,000 hours in the air while inflicting massive damage upon enemy positions, supplies, transportation, and communications. Among the squadrons based on &quot;Leyte&quot; were the VF-32 Swordsmen, flying the F4U Corsair.

&quot;Leyte&quot; returned to Norfolk for overhaul on 25 February 1951. After fleet training exercises in the Caribbean terminated on 21 August, the carrier departed for her fifth tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet on 3 September. She returned to Norfolk on 21 December for operations out of Hampton Roads, and again steamed for the Mediterranean on 29 August 1952. Reclassified CVA-32 on 1 October, she returned to Boston on 16 February 1953 for deactivation. On 8 August, however, she was ordered to be retained in the active fleet, and, redesignated CVS-32 on the same day, work was begun converting her to an ASW carrier.

Conversion completed on 4 January 1954, &quot;Leyte&quot; departed Boston for Quonset Point, Rhode Island, as flagship of Carrier Division 18 (CarDiv 18). She remained there for the next five years conducting ASW tactical operations along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean.

&quot;Leyte&quot; departed Quonset Point in January 1959 for the New York Navy Yard where she commenced preinactivation overhaul. She was redesignated AVT-10 and decommissioned both on 15 May 1959, and was assigned to the Philadelphia group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, where she remained until sold for scrap in September 1970 and completed in Chesapeake, Virginia.

===Incidents===
On 4 December 1950, the first African-American to complete the Navy&#x27;s basic flight training program, Ensign Jesse L. Brown, who was assigned to Fighter Squadron 32 (VF-32) aboard &quot;Leyte&quot;, was killed in action while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown&#x27;s wingman, Thomas J. Hudner Jr., was awarded the Medal of Honor for attempting to save Brown&#x27;s life.

At 15:15 on 16 October 1953, while at the South Boston Naval Annex and still under conversion to an antisubmarine carrier, &quot;Leyte&quot; suffered an explosion in her port catapult machinery room. Within minutes, naval base and city fire trucks were on the scene. After a hard and gallant fight, the fire was extinguished at 19:57. As a result of the fire, 37 men (including five civilians) died and 28 were injured. It remains the largest loss of life on the Boston waterfront.

On 26 February 1955, Hans Anton Michelberger, a fireman apprentice from Old Bridge, New Jersey, was swept overboard and lost at sea; his body was not recovered.

==Memorials==
The builder&#x27;s plaque from &quot;Leyte&quot; is in the collection of the Naval History and Heritage Command.

A historical marker honoring &quot;Leyte&quot; is located in Charlestown, Boston, near the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;. The inscription reads, in part: &quot;In memory of our shipmates and civilians lost in the disastrous explosion aboard the USS Leyte on October 16, 1953 while in the Boston Naval Shipyard.&quot;
