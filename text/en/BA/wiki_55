<text>Thiomargarita is a genus (family Thiotrichaceae) which includes the vacuolate sulfur bacteria species &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot;, &quot;Candidatus&quot; Thiomargarita nelsonii, and &quot;Ca.&quot; Thiomargarita joergensii. In 2022, scientists working in a Caribbean mangrove discovered an extremely large member of the genus, provisionally named &quot;Ca.&quot; T. magnifica, whose cells are easily visible to the naked eye at up to long.
Representatives of this genus can be found in a variety of environments that are rich in hydrogen sulfide, including methane seeps, mud volcanoes, brine pools, and organic-rich sediments such as those found beneath the Benguela Current and Humboldt Current. These bacteria are generally considered to be chemolithotrophs that utilize reduced inorganic species of sulfur as metabolic electron donors to produce energy for the fixation of carbon into biomass. Carbon fixation occurs via the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle and possibly the reverse Krebs cycle.

<text>Parliament House () in Dublin, Ireland, was home to the Parliament of Ireland, and since 1803 has housed the Bank of Ireland. It was the world&#x27;s first purpose-built bicameral parliament house. It is located at College Green.

==History==
Originally it was the site of Chichester House, which was built in the early 17th century by Sir Arthur Chichester. This building was adapted for use by the Irish Parliament in the 1670s, and was demolished to make way for a new parliamentary building. Chichester House was flanked by rows of narrow houses known as Dutch Billies, which were demolished and replaced during the Wide Streets Commission. Construction started in 1729. 

According to Patrick Wyse Jackson, curator of the Geological Museum at Trinity College Dublin, the granite used in the central &#x27;piazza&#x27; of the Parliament House may have come from the Baltyboys quarry close to Blessington, where contemporary documents show that one William Borrowdale was paid £6-16s-2d for &#x27;mountain stone&#x27; on 24 December 1729.&quot; It is known that granite quarrying had been taking place in west Wicklow since the early 1700s from several openings at Baltyboys, and &quot;from 1740 in more significant volumes at Woodend and Threecastles nearby and then from Golden Hill&quot;.

The Parliament House was built between 1729 and 1739, and is noteworthy for its decorations, which, unusually, were carved from granite as opposed to a more malleable stone. Wyse Jackson notes that &quot;they would have been difficult to produce, on account of the coarse texture of the rock, and so reflect the considerable skills of the stonemasons. It is unusual to find granite so delicately carved&quot;.

Once completed, the building became home to the two Houses of Parliament, serving as the seat of both chambers (the Lords and Commons) of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland for most of the 18th century until that parliament was abolished by the Act of Union of 1800, when Ireland became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

The current parliament building is Leinster House.

===Plans for the new building===

In the 17th century, parliament settled at Chichester House, a townhouse in Hoggen Green (later College Green) formerly owned by Sir George Carew, Lord President of Munster and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland, which had been built on the site of a nunnery disbanded by King Henry VIII at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries. Carew&#x27;s house, named Chichester House after its later owner Sir Arthur Chichester, was a building of sufficient importance to have become the temporary home of the Kingdom of Ireland&#x27;s law courts during the Michaelmas law term in 1605. Most famously, the legal documentation facilitating the Plantation of Ulster had been signed there on 16 November 1612.

Chichester House was in a dilapidated state, allegedly haunted and unfit for official use. In 1727 parliament voted to spend £6,000 on a new building on the site. It was to be the world&#x27;s first purpose-built two-chamber parliament building.

The then ancient Palace of Westminster, the seat of the English (before 1707) and, later, British Parliament, was a converted building; the House of Commons&#x27;s odd seating arrangements were due to the chamber&#x27;s previous existence as a chapel. Hence MPs faced each other from former pews.

The design of this building, one of two purpose-built Irish parliamentary buildings (along with Parliament Buildings, Stormont), was entrusted to an architect, Edward Lovett Pearce, who was a member of parliament and a protégé of the Speaker of the House of Commons, William Conolly of Castletown House. During construction, Parliament moved into the Blue Coat Hospital on Dublin&#x27;s northside. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 3February 1729 by Thomas Wyndham, 1st Baron Wyndham, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

==Design==

Pearce&#x27;s design was revolutionary. The building was effectively semi-circular in shape, occupying nearly 6,000 m2 (1.5 acres). Unlike Chichester House, which was set far back from Hoggen Green, the new building opened directly onto the Green. The principal entrance consisted of a colonnade of Ionic columns extending around three sides of the entrance quadrangle, forming a letter E (see picture below). Three statues, representing Hibernia (the Latin name for Ireland), Fidelity and Commerce (later carved by Edward Smyth) stood above the portico. Over the main entrance, the royal coat of arms was cut in stone.

The building underwent extensions by architect James Gandon, as Pearce had died. Gandon was responsible for three of Dublin&#x27;s finest buildings, the Custom House, the Four Courts and the King&#x27;s Inns. Between 1785 and 1789 he added a new peers&#x27; entrance at the east of the building, facing onto Westmoreland Street. Unlike the main entrance to the south, which came to be known as the House of Commons entrance, the new peers&#x27; entrance used six Corinthian columns, at the request of peers who wished their entrance to be distinct from the Ionic columns of the main entrance. Over this, three statues by Edward Smyth were placed, representing Fortitude, Justice and Liberty. A curved wall joined the Pearce entrance to Gandon&#x27;s extension. This masked the uneven joins of some of the extensions, as shown below. The wall, built of granite with inset alcoves, bears little resemblance to the building as it was in its parliamentary days.

Another extension was added on the west side into Foster Place, designed in 1787 by architect Robert Parke; while matching Gandon&#x27;s portico, he tried a different solution, linking the other portico to the main Pearce one by a set of Ionic pillars. The result proved unattractive. When the Bank of Ireland took over the building, it created an architectural unity by replacing this set of Ionic columns by a curved wall similar to Gandon&#x27;s east wall. Ionic columns were then added to both curved walls, giving the extensions an architectural and visual unity that had been lacking and producing the building&#x27;s ultimate exterior.

The interior contained one unusual and highly symbolic feature. While in many converted parliamentary buildings where both houses met in the same building, the houses were given equality or indeed the upper house was given a more prominent location within the building, in the new Irish Houses of Parliament the House of Commons was featured, with its octagonal parliamentary chamber located in the building&#x27;s centre. The smaller House of Lords was given a lesser position nearby.

The original, domed House of Commons chamber was destroyed by fire in the 1790s, and a less elaborate new chamber, without a dome, was rebuilt in the same location and opened in 1796, four years before the Parliament&#x27;s ultimate abolition.

===Materials===
Patrick Wyse Jackson, curator of the Geological Museum in Trinity College, assessed the building in 1993 and noted the following:
:&quot; &quot;It has a façade forty-seven metres long with a portico supported by impressive Ionic columns. The building has Calp Limestone rubble walls, which have been faced with Portland Stone. If you look closely at this stone you will find that it is full of shells, predominantly fossils of oyster shells... (The interior) contains a fireplace of black Kilkenny Marble. The Cash Office is floored in a chessboard pattern with slabs of Cork Red Marble alternating with Portland Stone.&quot;&quot;

==Pearce&#x27;s design copied==

Pearce&#x27;s designs came to be studied and copied both at home and abroad. The Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle imitated his top-lit corridors. The British Museum in Bloomsbury in London copied his colonnaded main entrance. His impact reached Washington, D.C., where Pearce&#x27;s building, and in particular his octagonal House of Commons chamber, was studied as plans were made for the United States Capitol building. While the shape of the chamber was not replicated, some of its decorative motifs were, with the ceiling structure in the Old Senate Chamber and old House of Representatives chamber (now the Statuary Hall) bearing a striking resemblance to Pearce&#x27;s ceiling in the House of Commons.

The uniqueness of the building, the quality of its workmanship and its central location in College Green, across from Trinity College Dublin, made it one of Dublin&#x27;s most highly regarded structures.

==Public ceremonies==


Much of the public ceremonies mirrored those of the British Houses of Parliament. Sessions were formally opened by a Speech from the Throne by the Lord Lieutenant, who &quot;used to sit, surrounded by more splendour than His Majesty on the throne of England&quot;. The Sovereign&#x27;s official representative, when he sat on the Throne, sat beneath a canopy of crimson velvet.

As in the English and British parliaments, the House of Lords was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sat on the Woolsack, a large seat stuffed with wool, which was seen as a symbol of economic success and wealth. At the State Opening of Parliament, Members were summoned from the nearby House of Commons chamber by White Rod, (as opposed to Black Rod in Westminster).

In the Commons, business was presided over by the Speaker, who in the absence of a government chosen from and answerable to the Commons was the dominant parliamentary figure. Speaker William Conolly remains today one of the most widely known figures ever to be produced by an Irish parliament, for his role in Parliament and for the wealth that allowed him to build one of Ireland&#x27;s greatest Georgian houses, Castletown House.

Sessions of parliament drew many of the wealthiest of Ireland&#x27;s Anglo-Irish Ascendancy to Dublin, particularly as sessions often coincided with the Irish Social Season, running from January to 17 March (St. Patrick&#x27;s Day), when the Lord Lieutenant presided in state over state balls and drawing rooms in the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle. Leading peers flocked to Dublin, where they lived in enormous and richly decorated townhouses, initially on the Northside of Dublin, later in new Georgian residences around Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square. Their presence in Dublin, along with large numbers of servants, provided a regular boost to the city&#x27;s economy.

The abolition of the Parliament in 1800 had a major economic impact. Within a decade, many of the finest mansions (including Leinster House, Powerscourt House, and Aldborough House) had been sold, often to government agencies. Though Parliament itself was based on the exclusion of the vast Irish Catholic majority in Ireland, many nationalist historians and writers blamed the absence of Parliament for Dublin&#x27;s increased impoverishment, with many of the large mansions in areas like Henrietta Street sold to property developers and landlords who reduced them to tenements.

The draw of the Viceregal Court and its social season was no longer enough to encourage most Irish peers and their entourages to come to Dublin. Their absence, with all their collective spending, severely damaged the Dublin economy, which went into dramatic decline. By the 1830s and 1840s, nationalist leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell was leading demand for the Repeal of the Act of Union and the re-establishment of an Irish parliament in Dublin, only this time one to which Catholics could be elected, in contrast with the earlier Anglican-only assembly.

Edgar F. Keatinge, writing in the &quot;Dublin Historical Record&quot; in 1947, recalled his visits to the building:

&quot;We frequently went down to the Bank of Ireland, College Green, to watch the 10 a.m. ceremony of &quot;changing the guard,&quot; another very colourful daily incident in the life of Dublin. All these things were part of the history of Dublin at that time, and they certainly provided a life, a movement, a colour, entirely unknown to-day.&quot;
==Abolition==

In the last thirty years of the Irish parliament, a series of crises and reforms changed its role. In 1782, following agitation by major parliamentary figures, but most notably Henry Grattan, the severe restrictions such as Poynings&#x27; Law that effectively controlled the Irish parliament&#x27;s ability to control its own legislative agenda were removed, producing what was known as the Constitution of 1782. A little over a decade later, Roman Catholics, who were by far the demographic majority, were allowed to cast votes in elections to Parliament, though they were still barred from office. The crisis over the &quot;madness&quot; of King George III produced a major strain in Anglo-Irish relations, as the King&#x27;s parliaments possessed the theoretical right to nominate a regent without the requirement that they choose the same person. Eventually the crisis passed with the King&#x27;s recovery.

The British Government decided the entire relationship between Britain and Ireland should be changed, with the merger of both kingdoms and their parliaments. After one failed attempt, this finally was achieved, albeit with mass bribery of members of both Houses, who were awarded British and United Kingdom peerages and other &quot;encouragements&quot;. In August 1800 Parliament held its last session in the Irish Houses of Parliament. On 1January 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland and its Parliament officially ceased to exist, with the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland coming into being, with a united parliament meeting in Westminster, to which Ireland sent approximately 100 members, while peers in the Peerage of Ireland had the constant right to elect a number of fellow Irish peers as Irish representative peers to represent Ireland in the House of Lords, on the model already introduced for Scottish peers.

==After 1800: Bank==


Initially, the former Parliament House was used for a variety of purposes, including as a military garrison and as an art gallery. In 1803 the fledgling Bank of Ireland bought the building from the British Government for £40,000 for use as its headquarters. As a result, the chamber was broken up to form small offices and by a magnificent cash office. Architect Francis Johnston (then the most prominent architect working in Ireland) was employed to oversee the conversion. However, the House of Lords chamber survived almost unscathed. It was used as the bank&#x27;s board room until the 1970s when the bank moved its headquarters. The chamber is now open to the public and is used for various public functions, including music recitals.

==Continuing symbolism==

Some of the building&#x27;s contents survived. The ceremonial mace of the House of Commons remained in the family of the last Speaker of the House of Commons, John Foster. The Bank of Ireland bought the Mace at a sale in Christie&#x27;s in London in 1937. The Chair of the Speaker of the House of Commons is now in the possession of the Royal Dublin Society, while a bench from the Commons is in the Royal Irish Academy. Two original tapestries remain in the House of Lords. Designed by Dutch landscape painter Willem Van der Hagen, and woven by John van Beaver, dating from circa 1733, the tapestries are unique. One represents the &quot;Battle of the Boyne&quot; and the other the &quot;Defence of Londonderry&quot;. Each tapestry has five portrait and narrative medallions around the central scene that depict, narrate and name central characters and events in the battles. Both also have &quot;trophies of arms and figures of Fame below enclosed by fringed curtains&quot;. The chandelier of the House of Commons now hangs in the Examination Hall of Trinity College Dublin. The Woolsack, on which the Lord Chancellor of Ireland sat when chairing sessions of the House of Lords, is now back on display in the chamber. Copies of debates of the old Irish Parliament are now kept in Leinster House, keeping a direct link between the two eras.

==Re-establishment of a Parliament in Dublin==

From the 1830s under Daniel O&#x27;Connell, generations of leaders campaigned for the creation of a new Irish parliament, convinced that the Act of Union had been a great mistake. While O&#x27;Connell campaigned for full-scale repeal, leaders like Isaac Butt and Charles Stewart Parnell sought a more modest form of Home Rule within the United Kingdom, rather than an independent Irish state. Leaders from O&#x27;Connell to Parnell and later John Redmond spoke of the proud day on which an Irish parliament might once again meet in what they called &quot;Grattan&#x27;s Parliament&quot; in College Green. When, in 1911, King George V and his consort Queen Mary visited Dublin (where they attracted mass crowds), street sellers sold drawings of the King and Queen arriving in the not-too-distant future at the Old Houses of Parliament in College Green.

In late April 1916, a small band of radical Republicans under Patrick Pearse staged the Easter Rising, in which they seized a number of prominent Irish buildings, mainly in Dublin, and proclaimed an Irish Republic. One building they did not take over was the old Parliament House. Perhaps they feared that, as a bank, it would be heavily protected. Perhaps, expecting that the Rising would ultimately fail and that the reaction to the Rising and what Pearse called their &quot;blood sacrifice&quot;, rather than the Rising itself, would reawaken Irish nationalism and produce independence, they did not seek to use the building for fear that it, like the GPO, would be destroyed in the British counter-attack. Or perhaps, because of its association with a former Ascendancy parliament, it carried little symbolism for them. The rising eventually led to the partitioning of Ireland and the establishment of the Irish Free State, which was a British Dominion rather than a form of Home Rule.

==The Dáil==

In January 1919, Irish republican MPs elected in the 1918 general election assembled to form the First Dáil and issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. They chose the Round Room of the Mansion House, the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Dublin for their home. (The Round Room had more royal connections than the old Parliament House; it had been built for the visit of King George IV in 1821.)

It is highly unlikely that the Bank of Ireland, then with a largely Unionist board (some of whom were directly descended from members of the former Irish Parliament), would have supplied the building for such use. The building was also a working bank and headquarters. In 1921 the British Government created a House of Commons of Southern Ireland through the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (also known as the Fourth Home Rule Act), though only four MPs (all unionists) assembled for the State Opening of Parliament by the Lord Lieutenant, which was held in the Royal College of Science rather than the old Parliament House. Section 66 of the 1920 Act stated that once the Government of Southern Ireland had provided alternative accommodation for the bank and compensation for moving, the old Parliament House would become vested in &quot;His Majesty for the use of the Parliament of Southern Ireland&quot;. However, the House of Commons of Southern Ireland failed to operate, no Government of Southern Ireland was ever formed, superseded by the Irish Free State.

In 1922, when the Provisional Government under W. T. Cosgrave made its plans for independence, it gave little thought to the old Parliament House. In addition to dealing with the bank, it lacked room around it for additional buildings to be used for governmental purposes. Directly behind it, was a major street called Fleet Street. In front of it, at both the Lords and Commons entrances, were major thoroughfares, College Green and Westmoreland Street, leaving the only space for expansion on its Foster Place side, which also had little space for offices. Finally, in the Ireland of 1922 with a civil war raging, the building was not secure enough to be used as a modern-day parliament.

As a result, the Free State initially hired Leinster House from its then-owner, the Royal Dublin Society, in 1922, before buying it in 1924. Longer-term plans either to convert the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, into a national parliament or to build a new parliament house, all fell through, leaving Leinster House as the accidental result.

==Modern view==


The house is seen generally with affection by Dubliners. It was used as a symbol by generations of nationalist leaders from Daniel O&#x27;Connell to Charles Stewart Parnell and John Redmond in their own quest for Irish self-government. In a particular irony, Sinn Féin, which as a republican party fought for Irish independence during the Anglo-Irish War, was founded by a man, Arthur Griffith, who sought to restore the King, Lords and Commons of Ireland and the 1782 constitution to the centre of Irish governance, and the College Green Houses of Parliament to its position as the home of an Irish parliament.

To this day some still lobby for the re-establishment of the College Green House of Parliament. In 2006, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Eamon Ryan, met with Bank of Ireland&#x27;s chief executive and chair to propose the building for an electronic library. In 2010, Minister of State, Seán Haughey, proposed that the building be handed over to the state in return for the Irish state&#x27;s bailout of the bank during the Irish banking crisis. Both suggestions were rejected by the bank.

Other suggestions included that the building be used to house the bank&#x27;s former art collection, that it be used as an office for an elected Lord Mayor of Dublin or that it house the Dáil or Seanad and act as a parliament building again. In 2011, Jimmy Deenihan, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, wrote to the bank setting out proposals to acquire the building as a venue for the state to use as a cultural venue and requesting a meeting with the bank&#x27;s Governor. TD Kevin Humphreys in 2012 also called for the bank to return the building to the state.

==Restoration works==
In 1976, almost 250 years after the foundation stone was laid, a series of restoration works were carried out on the building. Cleaning of the stone was required, as was replacing of some of the granite pieces, and remoulding of the portland stone. The stone cut contractor, Jim Murphy, noted how the Bank of Ireland had been lucky they contacted him when they did as the particular stonecutters who were good at this sort of work, and familiar with the handwork required, were available for work but were all in their 60s by that point and might not have been available in a further 10 or 20 years. 

RTÉ Radio 1 interviewed a number of stonecutters working at a height on the bank, who were using granite sourced from the Barnacullia quarries on the slopes of Three Rock Mountain, Dublin. The granite was cut and dressed at the yard in Barnacullia, from where it was brought to the bank to be further trimmed and fitted into place. The stoneworkers working on the bank were sourced from Barnacullia itself, as well as from the Ballyknockan granite quarries in County Wicklow. 

One of the workers remarked that the quality of some of the rock had diminished to such a degree that it was &quot;only dust now instead of granite&quot;. He pointed out marks of imperfection in the stone known as &quot;white horse&quot; that would need to be changed. The man also thought forward to the future and the next time the building would need to be restored, and wondered where the &quot;next stone cutters are going to come from to do it&quot; as there were &quot;no young fellas going to the trade&quot; and the machines couldn&#x27;t &quot;finish a stone&quot; no matter how good the machine was.

By 1981, restorations were still ongoing and an episode of the TV series &quot;Hands&quot; followed the work of some of the stoneworkers onsite for its episode entitled &#x27;Stone&#x27;. The episode depicted the work of Paddy Roe, a stonecutter from the Dublin Mountains, who was working on a replacement right hand for the statue of Hibernia (the female personification of Ireland) which stands as the central statue on the south pediment of the building. Roe had also carved Hibernia a new head, although this was not shown in the episode. Concurrent to being a stonecutter, Roe was also a teacher of stone carving at the National College of Art and Design at the time. The episode also filmed workmen setting a replacement facing wall of granite blocks at the building, and Ballyknockan stoneworker George Flynn grouting the base of an ionic column.

<doc id="219860" wikidata="Q6125066" url="?curid=219860" title="Matrimonial regime">
<text>Matrimonial regimes, or marital property systems, are systems of property ownership between spouses providing for the creation or absence of a marital estate and if created, what properties are included in that estate, how and by whom it is managed, and how it will be divided and inherited at the end of the marriage. Matrimonial regimes are applied either by operation of law or by way of prenuptial agreement in civil-law countries, and depend on the &quot;lex domicilii&quot; of the spouses at the time of or immediately following the wedding. (See e.g. Quebec Civil Code and French Civil Code, arts. 431-492.).

In most common law jurisdictions, the default and only matrimonial regime is separation of property, though some US states, known as community property states, are an exception. Also, in England, the birthplace of common law, pre-nuptial agreements were until recently completely unrecognized, and although the principle of separation of property prevailed, Courts are enabled to make a series of orders upon divorce regulating the distribution of assets.

Civil-law and bijuridical jurisdictions, including Quebec, Louisiana, France, South Africa, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and many others, have statutory default matrimonial regimes, in addition to or, in some cases, in lieu of regimes that can only be contracted by prenuptial agreements. Generally, couples marry into some form of community of property by default, or instead contract out under separation of property or some other regime through a prenuptial agreement passed before a civil-law notary or other public officer solemnizing the marriage. Many civil law jurisdictions also have other established systems of dividing property, such as separation of property and the participation regime that spouses can decide to adopt.

Five countries, including the Netherlands, have signed on to the Hague Convention on the Law applicable to Matrimonial Property Regimes, which entered into force on 1 September 1992, which allows spouses to choose not only the regimes offered by their country, but also any regime in force in the country where at least one is a citizen or resident or where marital real estate is situated.

==Coverture==
Coverture (sometimes spelled &quot;couverture&quot;) was a legal doctrine whereby, upon marriage, a woman&#x27;s legal rights were subsumed by those of her husband. Coverture was enshrined in the common law of England and the United States throughout most of the 19th century. The idea was described in William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; in the late 18th century.

Under traditional English common law an adult unmarried woman was considered to have the legal status of , while a married woman had the status of . These are English spellings of medieval Anglo-Norman phrases (the modern standard French spellings would be and , literally ).

A feme sole had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name. A feme covert was not recognized as having legal rights and obligations distinct from those of her husband in most respects. Instead, through marriage a woman&#x27;s existence was incorporated into that of her husband, so that she had very few recognized individual rights of her own. A married woman could not own property, sign legal documents or enter into a contract, obtain an education against her husband&#x27;s wishes, or keep a salary for herself. If a wife was permitted to work, under the laws of coverture she was required to relinquish her wages to her husband.

This situation persisted until the mid-to-late 19th century, when married women&#x27;s property acts started to be passed in many English-speaking legal jurisdictions, setting the stage for further reforms.

==Separate property systems==
Separate property systems are based on the premise that marriage is solely an interpersonal union

* Separate Property: All property, pre-marital or marital, is owned separately. (, , , , )
* Separate Property with Equitable Distribution: Under this system, when substantially more property acquired during a marriage is owned by one spouse (e.g. title to all marital property is held in the husband&#x27;s name only), the courts will make an equitable distribution of the richer spouse&#x27;s property at death or dissolution of the marriage. The object is to prevent widow(er)s and divorce(e)s, and their minor children, being cast into poverty by the death or divorce of the richer spouse.
* Accrual System (South Africa) or Deferred Community Property (Canada): Marital property is separately owned during the marriage, but after marriage (divorce, death of a spouse), the net assets are lumped together as property in joint tenancy and divided. (French , Spanish , Dutch , Afrikaans , Standard German , Swiss German , Italian , Brazilian Portuguese ).
* Common law system in the United states: the traditional common law system in the United States did not recognize &quot;marital property.&quot; Regardless of the length of marriage, each spouse retain ownership over property titled under that spouse&#x27;s name and property acquired with that spouse&#x27;s own earnings. However, a strict common law system is no longer the system of any U.S. state as of 2022, with most states instead classifying marital property and separate property, and distributing marital property based on the principle of equitable distribution.
** Tenancy by the Entirety (United States): &quot;TBE&quot; is a separate property system in which spouses are treated as one person, each having an equal ownership interest in the subject property. In some U.S. states, tenancy by the entirety is limited to realty (e.g. the couple take title to the family home as tenants by the entirety) while other states make it available for both realty and personality (e.g. the couple can also take title to the family automobile as tenants by the entirety).

==Community property systems==

Community property is premised on the theory that marriage creates an economic community between the spouses (who may be same- or opposite-sex) and that the marital property attaches to that interpersonal community, rather than to the spouses themselves. There are several types of community property systems.

== Participation system ==
The participation system is a system of property division among spouses introduced in many civil law jurisdictions. In Spanish it is known as , in French , and in German or .

The participation system is hybrid matrimonial regime with separation of property during the marriage, along with a right of each spouse to participate in a percentage of profits from &quot;acquests&quot; (property acquired during marriage) at the time of marital dissolution.

In Germany, it was introduced with the &quot;Equality Act of&quot; 1957. In Germany and Switzerland, this regime is particularly widespread and is the default regime in the absence of a marriage contract. In France, it was introduced by a 1965 law, inspired by the German model. The participation system is also available in Spain, Portugal and many Latin American countries.

<doc id="219861" wikidata="Q657037" url="?curid=219861" title="In-place algorithm">
<text>In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.

In-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length array requires bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is , though sometimes anything in is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers. 

An algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is &quot;write-only&quot;).

== Examples ==

Given an array of items, suppose we want an array that holds the same elements in reversed order and to dispose of the original. One seemingly simple way to do this is to create a new array of equal size, fill it with copies from in the appropriate order and then delete .

 function reverse(a[0..n - 1])
 allocate b[0..n - 1]
 for i from 0 to n - 1
 b[n − 1 − i] := a[i]
 return b

Unfortunately, this requires extra space for having the arrays and available simultaneously. Also, allocation and deallocation are often slow operations. Since we no longer need , we can instead overwrite it with its own reversal using this in-place algorithm which will only need constant number (2) of integers for the auxiliary variables and , no matter how large the array is.

 function reverse_in_place(a[0..n-1])
 for i from 0 to floor((n-2)/2)
 tmp := a[i]
 a[i] := a[n − 1 − i]
 a[n − 1 − i] := tmp

And for further clarification check leet code problem number 88

As another example, many sorting algorithms rearrange arrays into sorted order in-place, including: bubble sort, comb sort, selection sort, insertion sort, heapsort, and Shell sort. These algorithms require only a few pointers, so their space complexity is .

Quicksort operates in-place on the data to be sorted. However, quicksort requires stack space pointers to keep track of the subarrays in its divide and conquer strategy. Consequently, quicksort needs additional space. Although this non-constant space technically takes quicksort out of the in-place category, quicksort and other algorithms needing only additional pointers are usually considered in-place algorithms.

Most selection algorithms are also in-place, although some considerably rearrange the input array in the process of finding the final, constant-sized result.

Some text manipulation algorithms such as trim and reverse may be done in-place.

== In computational complexity ==

In computational complexity theory, the strict definition of in-place algorithms includes all algorithms with space complexity, the class DSPACE(1). This class is very limited; it equals the regular languages. In fact, it does not even include any of the examples listed above.

Algorithms are usually considered in L, the class of problems requiring additional space, to be in-place. This class is more in line with the practical definition, as it allows numbers of size as pointers or indices. This expanded definition still excludes quicksort, however, because of its recursive calls. 

Identifying the in-place algorithms with L has some interesting implications; for example, it means that there is a (rather complex) in-place algorithm to determine whether a path exists between two nodes in an undirected graph, a problem that requires extra space using typical algorithms such as depth-first search (a visited bit for each node). This in turn yields in-place algorithms for problems such as determining if a graph is bipartite or testing whether two graphs have the same number of connected components.

== Role of randomness ==

In many cases, the space requirements of an algorithm can be drastically cut by using a randomized algorithm. For example, if one wishes to know if two vertices in a graph of vertices are in the same connected component of the graph, there is no known simple, deterministic, in-place algorithm to determine this. However, if we simply start at one vertex and perform a random walk of about steps, the chance that we will stumble across the other vertex provided that it is in the same component is very high. Similarly, there are simple randomized in-place algorithms for primality testing such as the Miller–Rabin primality test, and there are also simple in-place randomized factoring algorithms such as Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm.

== In functional programming ==

Functional programming languages often discourage or do not support explicit in-place algorithms that overwrite data, since this is a type of side effect; instead, they only allow new data to be constructed. However, good functional language compilers will often recognize when an object very similar to an existing one is created and then the old one is thrown away, and will optimize this into a simple mutation &quot;under the hood&quot;.

Note that it is possible in principle to carefully construct in-place algorithms that do not modify data (unless the data is no longer being used), but this is rarely done in practice.

<doc id="219865" wikidata="Q62573436" url="?curid=219865" title="Actinomycetota">
<text>The Actinomycetota (or Actinobacteria) are a diverse phylum of Gram-positive bacteria with high GC content. They can be terrestrial or aquatic. They are of great importance to land flora because of their contributions to soil systems. In soil they help to decompose the organic matter of dead organisms so the molecules can be taken up anew by plants. While this role is also played by fungi, Actinomycetota are much smaller and likely do not occupy the same ecological niche. In this role the colonies often grow extensive mycelia, as fungi do, and the name of an important order of the phylum, Actinomycetales (the actinomycetes), reflects that they were long believed to be fungi. Some soil actinomycetota (such as &quot;Frankia&quot;) live symbiotically with the plants whose roots pervade the soil, fixing nitrogen for the plants in exchange for access to some of the plant&#x27;s saccharides. Other species, such as many members of the genus &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;, are important pathogens.

Beyond the great interest in Actinomycetota for their soil role, much is yet to be learned about them. Although currently understood primarily as soil bacteria, they might be more abundant in fresh waters. Actinomycetota is one of the dominant bacterial phyla and contains one of the largest of bacterial genera, &quot;Streptomyces&quot;. &quot;Streptomyces&quot; and other actinomycetota are major contributors to biological buffering of soils. They are also the source of many antibiotics.

The Actinomycetota genus &quot;Bifidobacterium&quot; is the most common bacteria in the microbiome of human infants. Although adults have fewer bifidobacteria, intestinal bifidobacteria help maintain the mucosal barrier and reduce lipopolysaccharide in the intestine.

Although some of the largest and most complex bacterial cells belong to the Actinomycetota, the group of marine Actinomarinales has been described as possessing the smallest free-living prokaryotic cells.

Some Siberian or Antarctic Actinomycetota are said to be the oldest living organism on Earth, frozen in permafrost at around half a million years ago. The symptoms of life were detected by release from permafrost samples 640 kya or younger.

==General==
Most Actinomycetota of medical or economic significance are in class Actinomycetia, and belong to the order Actinomycetales. While many of these cause disease in humans, &quot;Streptomyces&quot; is notable as a source of antibiotics.

Of those Actinomycetota not in the Actinomycetales, &quot;Gardnerella&quot; is one of the most researched. Classification of &quot;Gardnerella&quot; is controversial, and MeSH catalogues it as both a Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism.

Actinomycetota, especially &quot;Streptomyces&quot; spp., are recognized as the producers of many bioactive metabolites that are useful to humans in medicine, such as antibacterials, antifungals, antivirals, antithrombotics, immunomodifiers, antitumor drugs, and enzyme inhibitors; and in agriculture, including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and growth-promoting substances for plants and animals. Actinomycetota-derived antibiotics that are important in medicine include aminoglycosides, anthracyclines, chloramphenicol, macrolide, tetracyclines, etc.

Actinomycetota have high guanine and cytosine content in their DNA. The G+C content of Actinomycetota can be as high as 70%, though some may have a low G+C content.

Analysis of glutamine synthetase sequence has been suggested for phylogenetic analysis of the Actinomycetota.

<text>Family patrimony is a type of civil law patrimony that is created by marriage or civil union (where recognized) which creates a bundle of entitlements and obligations that must be shared by the spouses or partners upon divorce, annulment, dissolution of marriage or dissolution of civil union, when there must be a division of property. It is similar to the common law concept of community property.

<text>Community property (United States) also called community of property (South Africa) is a marital property regime whereby property acquired during a marriage is considered to be owned by both spouses and subject to division between them in the event of divorce. Conversely, property owned by one spouse before the marriage, along with gifts and inheritances they receive during marriage, are treated as that spouse&#x27;s separate property in the event of divorce. In some cases, separate property can be &quot;transmuted&quot; into community property, or be included in the marital estate for reasons of equity. Community property can also be relevant in probate law, during the disposition of a will.

The concept of community property originated in civil law jurisdictions but is now also found in some common law jurisdictions. Community property regimes can be found in countries around the world including Sweden, Germany, Italy, France, South Africa and parts of the United States. In civil law countries such as Spain, France and Germany, spouses can generally select one of several matrimonial regimes to divide property, with community property being one option, along with the separate property system and a participation system.

==Variations==
* Community of Acquests and Gains: Each spouse owns an undivided half-interest in all property acquired during the marriage, except for property acquired by gift or inheritance during the marriage, which is separate property; or which traces to separate property acquired before the marriage, which remains separate property; or which is acquired during a period when the couple are permanently living separately and apart (e.g., legal separation, actual, or &quot;de facto&quot;), which is also separate property. This genre of community property is also called &quot;ganancial community property.&quot; (Fr &quot;communauté réduite aux acquêts&quot;, Sp &quot;sociedad de gananciales&quot;, Du &quot;gemeenschap van aanwinst van goederen&quot;, &quot;gemeenschap van vruchten en inkomsten&quot;, Ger &quot;Errungenschaftsgemeinschaft&quot;, It &quot;comunione degli acquisti&quot;)
* Community of Profit and Loss: similar to above but liabilities (&quot;losses&quot;) are separate property. (Du &quot;gemeenschap van winst en verlies&quot;, Afrik &quot;gemeenskap van wins en verlies&quot;)
* Community of Personal and Marital Property: Community property consists of all property, personalty and realty, acquired during the marriage; and all personalty acquired before the marriage. Realty acquired before marriage is separate property. (Fr &quot;communauté de meubles et acquêts&quot;, Du &quot;gemeenschap van inboedel&quot;, Ger &quot;Fahrnisgemeinschaft&quot;).
* Limited Community Property: Similar to community of acquests and gains but certain marital property is separate property. (Fr &quot;communauté de biens limitée&quot;, Du &quot;beperkte gemeenschap van goederen&quot;, Swiss Ger &quot;Ausschlussgemeinschaft&quot;)
* Universal or Absolute Community Property: All pre-marital and marital property is community property. However, if there are children from a prior marriage, the property associated with that marital community may be segregated from the community property of a subsequent marriage, to ensure the children of the prior spouse have an inheritance. (Fr &quot;communauté universelle&quot;, Sp &quot;comunidad absoluta de bienes&quot;, Du &quot;algehele gemeenschap van goederen&quot;, Ger &quot;allgemeine Gütergemeinschaft&quot;, It &quot;comunione universale dei beni&quot;)

==Jurisdictions==
===Custom of Paris in New France===

=== Russia ===
In Russia, community property was introduced by the Soviet government in 1926. Prior to that, laws evolved by the late 18th century dictated separate property regime, so a married woman was (at least in theory) in full charge of her property, including the dowry and whatever she acquired personally during the marriage. The new Soviet system replaced this with a limited form of community property, namely community of acquisitions, and it survives to the present day. The only significant change, made in 1995, was the introduction of marital agreement which didn&#x27;t exist under the Soviet law. Such an agreement may be signed at any time before or after conclusion of the marriage. It may regulate the spouses&#x27; rights on a basis entirely alien to the statutory regime, but shouldn&#x27;t put any of them (especially one who cannot provide for themselves) into a clearly unfavorable position.

===South Africa===

In South Africa, if a couple does not sign an antenuptial contract, before a notary public, which is subsequently registered at a deeds office, prior to marriage, they are married in community of property, which means that all of their assets and liabilities (even those acquired before the marriage) are merged into a joint estate during their marriage, in which each spouse has an undivided half-share. Each spouse has equal power to deal independently with the estate, except that certain major transactions require the consent of both spouses. One of the consequences of community of property in South Africa is that if one spouse is declared insolvent (bankrupt) during the marriage, the other also becomes insolvent, a potentially devastating consequence.

===United States===

The United States has nine community property states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Four other states have adopted optional community property systems. Alaska allows spouses to create community property by entering into a community property agreement or by creating a community property trust. In 2010, Tennessee adopted a law similar to Alaska&#x27;s and allows residents and non-residents to opt into community property through a community property trust. More recently, Kentucky adopted an optional community property system in 2020, allowing residents and non-residents to establish community property trusts. Finally, in 2021 Florida adopted a similar law, allowing citizens and noncitizens to establish community property trusts. The commonwealth of Puerto Rico allows property to be owned as community property also as do several Native American jurisdictions.

Division of community property may take place by item by splitting all items or by values. In some jurisdictions, such as California, a 50/50 division of community property is strictly mandated by statute so the focus then shifts to whether particular items are to be classified as community or separate property. In other jurisdictions, such as Texas, a divorce court may decree an &quot;equitable distribution&quot; of community property, which may result in an &quot;unequal division&quot; of such. In non-community property states property may be divided by equitable distribution. Generally speaking, the property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (not community property). See division of property. Division of community debts may not be the same as division of community property. For example, in California, community property is required to be divided &quot;equally&quot; while community debt is required to be divided &quot;equitably&quot;.

<doc id="219877" wikidata="Q1147615" url="?curid=219877" title="International human rights law">
<text>International human rights law (IHRL) is the body of international law designed to promote human rights on social, regional, and domestic levels. As a form of international law, international human rights law is primarily made up of treaties, agreements between sovereign states intended to have binding legal effect between the parties that have agreed to them; and customary international law. Other international human rights instruments, while not legally binding, contribute to the implementation, understanding and development of international human rights law and have been recognized as a source of &quot;political&quot; obligation.

International human rights law, which governs the conduct of a state towards its people in peacetime is traditionally seen as distinct from international humanitarian law which governs the conduct of states and non-state armed groups during conflict, although the two branches of law are complementary and in some ways overlap.

A more systemic perspective explains that international humanitarian law represents a function of international human rights law; it includes general norms that apply to everyone at all time as well as specialized norms which apply to certain situations such as armed conflict between both state and military occupation (i.e. IHL) or to certain groups of people including refugees (e.g. the 1951 Refugee Convention), children (the Convention on the Rights of the Child), and prisoners of war (the 1949 Third Geneva Convention).

== United Nations system ==
The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action in 1993, in terms of which the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was established.
In 2006, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights was replaced with the United Nations Human Rights Council for the enforcement of international human rights law. The changes prophesied a more structured organization along with a requirement to review human rights cases every four years. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 also targets the promotion of legislation and policies towards reducing inequality.

== International Bill of Human Rights ==

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a UN General Assembly declaration that does not in form create binding international human rights law. Many legal scholars cite the UDHR as evidence of customary international law.

More broadly, the UDHR has become an authoritative human rights reference. It has provided the basis for subsequent international human rights instruments that form non-binding, but ultimately authoritative international human rights law.

== International human rights treaties ==

Besides the adoption in 1966 of the two wide-ranging Covenants that form part of the International Bill of Human Rights (namely the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), other treaties have been adopted at the international level. These are generally known as &quot;human rights instruments&quot;. Some of the most significant include the following:

*the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPCG) (adopted 1948 and entered into force in 1951);
* the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (CSR) (adopted in 1951 and entered into force in 1954);
* the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) (adopted in 1965 and entered into force in 1969);
* the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) (entered into force in 1981);
* the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT) (adopted in 1984 and entered into force in 1987);
* the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) (adopted in 1989 and entered into force in 1990);
* the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (ICRMW) (adopted in 1990 and entered into force in 2003);
* the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) (entered into force on 3 May 2008); and
* the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED) (adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2010).

== Regional protection and institutions ==
Regional systems of international human rights law supplement and complement national and international human rights law by protecting and promoting human rights in specific areas of the world. There are three key regional human rights instruments which have established human rights law on a regional basis:

* the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights for Africa of 1981, in force since 1986;
* the American Convention on Human Rights for the Americas of 1969, in force since 1978; and
* the European Convention on Human Rights for Europe of 1950, in force since 1953.

=== Americas and Europe ===

The Organisation of American States and the Council of Europe, like the UN, have adopted treaties (albeit with weaker implementation mechanisms) containing catalogues of economic, social and cultural rights, in addition to the aforementioned conventions dealing mostly with civil and political rights:

* the European Social Charter for Europe of 1961, in force since 1965 (whose complaints mechanism, created in 1995 under an Additional Protocol, has been in force since 1998); and
* the Protocol of San Salvador to the ACHR for the Americas of 1988, in force since 1999.

===Africa ===

The African Union (AU) is a supranational union consisting of 55 African countries. Established in 2001, the AU&#x27;s purpose is to help secure Africa&#x27;s democracy, human rights, and a sustainable economy, in particular by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective and productive common market.

The  Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights is the region&#x27;s principal human rights instrument, which emerged under the aegis of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) (since replaced by the African Union). The intention to draw up the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights was announced in 1979. The Charter was unanimously approved at the OAU&#x27;s 1981 Assembly.

Pursuant to Article 63 (whereby it was to &quot;come into force three months after the reception by the Secretary General of the instruments of ratification or adherence of a simple majority&quot; of the OAU&#x27;s member states), the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights came into effect on 21 October 1986, in honour of which 21 October was declared African Human Rights Day.

The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights (ACHPR) is a quasi-judicial organ of the African Union, tasked with promoting and protecting human rights and collective (peoples&#x27;) rights throughout the African continent, as well as with interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights, and considering individual complaints of violations of the Charter. The commission has three broad areas of responsibility:

# promoting human and peoples&#x27; rights;
# protecting human and peoples&#x27; rights; and
# interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights.

In pursuit of these goals, the commission is mandated to &quot;collect documents, undertake studies and researches on African problems in the field of human and peoples&#x27; rights, organise seminars, symposia and conferences, disseminate information, encourage national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples&#x27; rights and, should the case arise, give its views or make recommendations to governments.&quot;

With the creation of the African Court on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights (under a protocol to the Charter which was adopted in 1998 and entered into force in January 2004), the commission will have the additional task of preparing cases for submission to the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction. In a July 2004 decision, the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights would be integrated with the African Court of Justice.

The Court of Justice of the African Union is intended to be the &quot;principal judicial organ of the Union&quot;. Although it has not yet been established, it is intended to take over the duties of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights, as well as to act as the supreme court of the African Union, interpreting all necessary laws and treaties. The Protocol establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights entered into force in January 2004, but its merging with the Court of Justice has delayed its establishment. The Protocol establishing the Court of Justice will come into force when ratified by fifteen countries.

There are many countries in Africa accused of human rights violations by the international community and NGOs.

=== Inter-American system ===

The Organization of American States (OAS) is an international organization headquartered in Washington, DC. Its members are the thirty-five independent nation-states of the Americas.

Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the Cold War, the return to democracy in Latin America, and the thrust toward globalisation, the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. Its stated priorities now include the following:

* strengthening democracy;
* working for peace;
* protecting human rights;
* combating corruption;
* the rights of indigenous peoples; and
* promoting sustainable development.

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) is an autonomous organ of the Organization of American States, also based in Washington, D.C. Along with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, based in San José, Costa Rica, it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter-American system for the promotion and protection of human rights. The IACHR is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere. Its human rights duties stem from three documents:

# the OAS Charter;
# the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man; and
# the American Convention on Human Rights.

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights was established in 1979 with the purpose of enforcing and interpreting the provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights. Its two main functions are therefore adjudicatory and advisory:

* Under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it.
* Under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states.

Many countries in the Americas, including Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela, have been accused of human rights violations.

=== European system ===

The Council of Europe, founded in 1949, is the oldest organisation working for European integration. It is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law, and has observer status at the United Nations. The seat of the council is in Strasbourg in France.

The Council of Europe is responsible for both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights. These institutions bind the council&#x27;s members to a code of human rights which, although strict, is more lenient than that of the UN Charter on human rights.

The council also promotes the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the European Social Charter. Membership is open to all European states which seek European integration, accept the principle of the rule of law, and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and freedoms.

The Council of Europe is separate from the European Union, but the latter is expected to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. The Council includes all the member states of European Union. The EU also has a separate human rights document, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

The European Convention on Human Rights has since 1950 defined and guaranteed human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe. All 47 member states of the Council of Europe have signed this convention, and are therefore under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In order to prevent torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture was established.

The Council of Europe also adopted the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in May 2005, for protection against human trafficking and sexual exploitation, the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse in October 2007, and the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence in May 2011.

The European Court of Human Rights is the only international court with jurisdiction to deal with cases brought by individuals rather than states. In early 2010, the court had a backlog of over 120,000 cases and a multi-year waiting list. About one out of every twenty cases submitted to the court is considered admissible. In 2007, the court issued 1,503 verdicts. At the current rate of proceedings, it would take 46 years for the backlog to clear.

== Monitoring, implementation and enforcement ==
There is currently no international court to administer international human rights law, but quasi-judicial bodies exist under some UN treaties (like the Human Rights Committee under the ICCPR). The International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction over the crime of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The European Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights enforce regional human rights law.

Although these same international bodies also hold jurisdiction over cases regarding international humanitarian law, it is crucial to recognise, as discussed above, that the two frameworks constitute different legal regimes.

The United Nations human rights bodies do have some quasi-legal enforcement mechanisms. These include the treaty bodies attached to the seven currently active treaties, and the United Nations Human Rights Council complaints procedures, with Universal Periodic Review and United Nations Special Rapporteur (known as the 1235 and 1503 mechanisms respectively).

The enforcement of international human rights law is the responsibility of the nation state; it is the primary responsibility of the State to make the human rights of its citizens a reality.

In practice, many human rights are difficult to enforce legally, due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights, the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them.

In over 110 countries, national human rights institutions (NHRIs) have been set up to protect, promote or monitor human rights with jurisdiction in a given country. Although not all NHRIs are compliant with the Paris Principles, the number and effect of these institutions is increasing.

The Paris Principles were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Paris from 7 to 9 October 1991, and adopted by UN Human Rights Commission Resolution 1992/54 of 1992 and General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of 1993. The Paris Principles list a number of responsibilities for NHRIs.

=== Universal jurisdiction ===

Universal jurisdiction is a controversial principle in international law, whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over people whose alleged crimes were committed outside the boundaries of the prosecuting state, regardless of nationality, country of residence or any other relationship to the prosecuting country. The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all, which any state is authorized to punish. The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are &quot;erga omnes&quot;, or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of &quot;jus cogens&quot;.

In 1993, Belgium passed a &quot;law of universal jurisdiction&quot; to give its courts jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries. In 1998, Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London following an indictment by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón under the universal-jurisdiction principle. Adolf Eichmann who was the former Nazi SS lieutenant colonel accused of overseeing the transfer of Jews to Holocaust death camps also persecuted in Israel in 1961. Adolf was living in Argentina after the war.
The principle is supported by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations, which believe that certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole, and that the community has a moral duty to act.

Others, like Henry Kissinger, argue that &quot;widespread agreement that human rights violations and crimes against humanity must be prosecuted has hindered active consideration of the proper role of international courts. Universal jurisdiction risks creating universal tyranny—that of judges&quot;.

<doc id="219878" wikidata="Q6502154" url="?curid=219878" title="Geographical exploration">
<text>Geographical exploration, sometimes considered the default meaning for the more general term exploration, refers to the practice of discovering remote lands and regions of the planet Earth. It is studied by geographers and historians.

Two major eras of exploration occurred in human history: one of convergence, and one of divergence. The first, covering most of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; history, saw humans moving out of Africa, settling in new lands, and developing distinct cultures in relative isolation. Early explorers settled in Europe and Asia; 14,000 years ago, some crossed the Ice Age land bridge from Siberia to Alaska, and moved southbound to settle in the Americas. For the most part, these cultures were ignorant of each other&#x27;s existence. The second period of exploration, occurring over the last 10,000 years, saw increased cross-cultural exchange through trade and exploration, and marked a new era of cultural intermingling, and more recently, convergence.

Early writings about exploration date back to the 4th millennium B.C. in ancient Egypt. One of the earliest and most impactful thinkers of exploration was Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Between the 5th century and 15th century AD, most exploration was done by Chinese and Arab explorers. This was followed by the Age of Discovery after European scholars rediscovered the works of early Latin and Greek geographers. While the Age of Discovery was partly driven by European land routes becoming unsafe, and a desire for conquest, the 17th century saw exploration driven by nobler motives, including scientific discovery and the expansion of knowledge about the world. This broader knowledge of the world&#x27;s geography meant that people were able to make world maps, depicting all land known. The first modern atlas was the &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot;, published by Abraham Ortelius, which included a world map that depicted all of Earth&#x27;s continents.

==Concept==
Exploration is the process of exploring, which has been defined as:
* To examine or investigate something systematically.
* To travel somewhere in search of discovery.
* To examine diagnostically.
* To (seek) experience first hand.
* To wander without any particular aim or purpose.

==Notable historical periods of human exploration==
===Phoenician galley sailings===
The Phoenicians (1550 BCE–300 BCE) traded throughout the Mediterranean Sea and Asia Minor though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to Britain. According to Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen Dido was a Phoenician from Tyre who sailed to North Africa and founded the city of Carthage.

====Carthaginean exploration of Western Africa====
Hanno the Navigator (500 BC), a Carthaginean navigator who explored the Western Coast of Africa.

===Greek and Roman exploration of Northern Europe and Thule===
* Pytheas (4th century BC), a Greek explorer from Massalia (Marseille), was the first to circumnavigate Great Britain, explore Germany, and reach &quot;Thule&quot; (most commonly thought to be the Shetland Islands or Iceland).
* Under Augustus, Romans reached and explored all the Baltic Sea.

===Roman explorations===
;Africa exploration
The Romans organized expeditions to cross the Sahara along five different routes:

*through the Western Sahara, toward the Niger River, near modern Timbuktu
*through the Tibesti Mountains, toward Lake Chad and modern Nigeria
*up the Nile valley through Egypt, toward the Great Rift Valley
*along the western coast of Africa, toward the Sénégal River
*along the coast of the Red Sea, toward the Horn of Africa, and perhaps modern Zanzibar.

All these expeditions were supported by legionaries and had mainly a commercial purpose. Only the one conducted by emperor Nero seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of Ethiopia or Nubia; in 62 AD, two legionaries explored the sources of the Nile.

One of the main objectives of the explorations was to locate and obtain gold, using camels to transport it overland back to Roman provinces on the Mediterranean coast.

The explorations near the African western and eastern coasts were supported by Roman ships and deeply related to the naval commerce (mainly toward the Indian Ocean).
The Romans also organized several explorations into Northern Europe, and explored as far as China in Asia.

;30 BC – 640 AD: With the acquisition of Ptolemaic Egypt, the Romans begin trading with India. The Romans now have a direct connection to the spice trade, which the Egyptians had established beginning in 118 BC.

;100–166 AD: Sino-Roman relations begin. Ptolemy writes of the Golden Chersonese (i.e. Malay Peninsula) and the trade port of Kattigara, now identified as Óc Eo in northern Vietnam, then part of Jiaozhou, a province of the Chinese Han Empire. The Chinese historical texts describe Roman embassies, from a land they called &quot;Daqin&quot;.

;2nd century: Roman traders reach Siam, Cambodia, Sumatra, and Java.

;161: An embassy from Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius or his successor Marcus Aurelius reaches Chinese Emperor Huan of Han at Luoyang.

;226: A Roman diplomat or merchant lands in northern Vietnam and visits Nanjing, China and the court of Sun Quan, ruler of Eastern Wu.

===Chinese exploration of Central Asia===
During the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty explored much of the Eastern Northern Hemisphere. Starting in 139 BC, the Han diplomat Zhang Qian traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da Yuezhi against the Xiongnu (the Yuezhi had been evicted from Gansu by the Xiongnu in 177 BC); however, Zhang&#x27;s travels discovered entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of, including the remnants of the conquests of Alexander the Great (r. 336–323 BC). When Zhang returned to China in 125 BC, he reported on his visits to Dayuan (Fergana), Kangju (Sogdia), and Daxia (Bactria, formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom which had just been subjugated by the Da Yuezhi). Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China, and although he did not venture there, described Shendu (the Indus River valley of Northwestern India) and Anxi (Parthian territories) further west.

===Viking Age===
From about 800 AD to 1040 AD, the Vikings explored Iceland and much of the Western Northern Hemisphere via rivers and oceans. For example, it is known that the Norwegian Viking explorer, Erik the Red (950–1003), sailed to and settled in Greenland after being expelled from Iceland, while his son, the Icelandic explorer Leif Erikson (980–1020), reached Newfoundland and the nearby North American coast, and is believed to be the first European to land in North America.

===Polynesian Age===
Polynesians were a maritime people, who populated and explored the central and south Pacific for around 5,000 years, up to about 1280 when they discovered New Zealand. The key invention to their exploration was the outrigger canoe, which provided a swift and stable platform for carrying goods and people. Based on limited evidence, it is thought that the voyage to New Zealand was deliberate. It is unknown if one or more boats went to New Zealand, or the type of boat, or the names of those who migrated. 2011 studies at Wairau Bar in New Zealand show a high probability that one origin was Ruahine Island in the Society Islands. Polynesians may have used the prevailing north easterly trade winds to reach New Zealand in about three weeks. The Cook Islands are in direct line along the migration path and may have been an intermediate stopping point. There are cultural and language similarities between Cook Islanders and New Zealand Māori. Early Māori had different legends of their origins, but the stories were misunderstood and reinterpreted in confused written accounts by early European historians in New Zealand trying to present a coherent pattern of Māori settlement in New Zealand.

Mathematical modelling based on DNA genome studies, using state of the art techniques, have shown that a large number of Polynesian migrants (100–200), including women, arrived in New Zealand around the same time, in about 1280. Otago University studies have tried to link distinctive DNA teeth patterns, which show special dietary influence, with places in or nearby the Society Islands.

===Chinese exploration of the Indian Ocean===
The Chinese explorer, Wang Dayuan (fl. 1311–1350) made two major trips by ship to the Indian Ocean. During 1328–1333, he sailed along the South China Sea and visited many places in Southeast Asia and reached as far as South Asia, landing in Sri Lanka and India, and he even went to Australia. Then in 1334–1339, he visited North Africa and East Africa. Later, the Chinese admiral Zheng He (1371–1433) made seven voyages to Arabia, East Africa, India, Indonesia, and Thailand.

===European Age of Discovery===
The Age of Discovery, also known as the Age of Exploration, is one of the most important periods of geographical exploration in human history. It started in the early 15th century and lasted until the 17th century. In that period, Europeans discovered and/or explored vast areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Portugal and Spain dominated the first stages of exploration, while other European nations followed, such as England, France, and the Netherlands.
Important explorations during this period went to a number of continents and regions around the globe. In Africa, important explorers of this period include Diogo Cão (1452–1486), who discovered and ascended the Congo River and reached the coasts of present-day Angola and Namibia; and Bartolomeu Dias (1450–1500), the first European to reach the Cape of Good Hope and other parts of the South African coast.

Explorers of routes from Europe towards Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean, include Vasco da Gama (1460–1524), a navigator who made the first trip from Europe to India and back by the Cape of Good Hope, discovering the ocean route to the East; Pedro Álvares Cabral (1467/1468–1520), who, following the path of Vasco da Gama, claimed Brazil and led the first expedition that linked Europe, Africa, America, and Asia; Diogo Dias, who discovered the eastern coast of Madagascar and rounded the corner of Africa; explorers such as Diogo Fernandes Pereira and Pedro Mascarenhas (1470–1555), among others, who discovered and mapped the Mascarene Islands and other archipelagos.

António de Abreu (1480–1514) and Francisco Serrão (14??–1521) led the first direct European fleet into the Pacific Ocean (on its western edges) and through the Sunda Islands, reaching the Moluccas. Andrés de Urdaneta (1498–1568) discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas.

In the Pacific Ocean, Jorge de Menezes (1498–1537) reached New Guinea while García Jofre de Loaísa (1490–1526) reached the Marshall Islands.

;Discovery of America
Explorations of the Americas began with the initial discovery of America by Christopher Columbus (1451–1506), who led a Castilian (Spanish) expedition across the Atlantic, discovering America. After the discovery of America by Columbus, a number of important expeditions were sent out to explore the Western Hemisphere. This included Juan Ponce de León (1474–1521), who discovered and mapped the coast of Florida; Vasco Núñez de Balboa (1475–1519), who was the first European to view the Pacific Ocean from American shores (after crossing the Isthmus of Panama) confirming that America was a separate continent from Asia; Aleixo Garcia (14??–1527), who explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, crossing the Chaco and reaching the Andes (near Sucre).

Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca (1490–1558) discovered the Mississippi River and was the first European to sail the Gulf of Mexico and cross Texas. Jacques Cartier (1491–1557) drew the first maps of part of central and maritime Canada; Francisco Vázquez de Coronado (1510–1554) discovered the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River; Francisco de Orellana (1511–1546) was the first European to navigate the length of the Amazon River.

;Further explorations
Ferdinand Magellan (1480–1521), was the first navigator to cross the Pacific Ocean, discovering the Strait of Magellan, the Tuamotus and Mariana Islands, and achieving a nearly complete circumnavigation of the Earth, in multiple voyages, for the first time. Juan Sebastián Elcano (1476–1526), completed the first global circumnavigation.

In the second half of the 16th century and the 17th century exploration of Asia and the Pacific Ocean continued with explorers such as Andrés de Urdaneta (1498–1568), who discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas; Pedro Fernandes de Queirós (1565–1614), who discovered the Pitcairn Islands and the Vanuatu archipelago; Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira (1542–1595), who discovered the Tuvalu archipelago, the Marquesas, the Solomons, and Wake Island.

Explorers of Australia included Willem Janszoon (1570–1630), who made the first recorded European landing in Australia; Yñigo Ortiz de Retez, who discovered and reached eastern and northern New Guinea; Luis Váez de Torres (1565–1613), who discovered the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea; Abel Tasman (1603–1659), who explored North Australia, discovered Tasmania, New Zealand, and Tongatapu.

In North America, major explorers included Henry Hudson (1565–1611), who explored the Hudson Bay in Canada; Samuel de Champlain (1574–1635), who explored St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes (in Canada and northern United States); and René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle (1643–1687), who explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire length of the Mississippi River.

===Late modern period===

Long after the Age of Discovery, other explorers &quot;completed&quot; the world map, such as various Russian explorers, reaching the Siberian Pacific coast and the Bering Strait, at the extreme edge of Asia and Alaska (North America); Vitus Bering (1681–1741) who in the service of the Russian Navy, explored the Bering Strait, the Bering Sea, the North American coast of Alaska, and some other northern areas of the Pacific Ocean; and James Cook, who explored the east coast of Australia, the Hawaiian Islands, and circumnavigated Antarctica.

There were still significant explorations which occurred well into the late modern period. This includes the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–1806), an overland expedition dispatched by President Thomas Jefferson to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase and to find an interior aquatic route to the Pacific Ocean, along with other objectives to examine the flora and fauna of the continent. In 1818, the British researcher John Ross was the first to find that the deep sea is inhabited by life when catching jellyfish and worms in about depth with a special device. The United States Exploring Expedition (1838–1842) was an expedition sent by President Andrew Jackson, in order to survey the Pacific Ocean and surrounding lands.

The extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies to endure them. In the 20th century, deep-sea exploration advanced considerably through a series of technological inventions, ranging from the sonar system, which can detect the presence of solid objects underwater through the use of reflected sound, to manned deep-diving submersibles. In 1960, Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in the bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot; into the deepest part of the world&#x27;s oceans, the Mariana Trench. In 2018, , piloted by Victor Vescovo, completed the first mission to the deepest point of the Atlantic Ocean, diving below the ocean surface to the base of the Puerto Rico Trench. With the advent of satellite imagery and aviation, broad scale exploration of the surface of Earth has largely ceased, however the culture of many disconnected tribes still remain undocumented and left to be explored, and the details of more inaccessible ecosystems remains undescribed. Urban exploration is the exploration of manmade structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the manmade environment.

===Space age===
Space exploration started in the 20th century with the invention of exo-atmospheric rockets. This has given humans the opportunity to travel to the Moon, and to send robotic explorers to other planets and far beyond.

Both of the Voyager probes have left the Solar System, bearing imprinted gold discs with multiple data types.

==Underwater exploration==
===Objectives===
The scope of underwater exploration includes the distribution and variety of marine and aquatic life, measurement of the geographical distribution of the chemical and physical properties, including movement of the water, and the geophysical, geological and topographical features of the Earth&#x27;s crust where it is covered by water.

Systematic, targeted exploration is the most effective method to increase understanding of the ocean and other underwater regions, so they can be effectively managed, conserved, regulated, and their resources discovered, accessed, and used. The ocean covers approximately 70% of Earth’s surface and has a critical role in supporting life on the planet but knowledge and understanding of the ocean remains limited due to difficulty and cost of access.

The distinction between exploration, survey, and other research is somewhat blurred, and one way of looking at it is to consider the baseline surveys and research as exploration, as previously unknown information is gathered. Updating and refining the data is less exploratory in nature, but may still be exploration for the people involved, in the sense that the experience is new to them.

===Status===
According to NOAA, as of January 2023: &quot;More than eighty percent of our ocean is unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored.&quot; Less than 10% of the ocean, including about 35% of the ocean and coastal waters of the United States, have been mapped in any detail using sonar technology. According to GEBCO 2019 data, less than 18% of the deep ocean bed has been mapped using direct measurement and about 50% of coastal waters were not yet surveyed.

Most of the data used to create global seabed maps are approximate depths derived from satellite gravity measurements and sea surface heights which are affected by the shape and mass distribution of the seabed. This method of approximation only provides low resolution information on large topographical features, and can miss significant features.

<text>The &quot;Lensman&quot; series is a series of science fiction novels by American author E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith. It was a runner-up for the 1966 Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series, losing to the &quot;Foundation&quot; series by Isaac Asimov.

==Plot==

The series begins with &quot;Triplanetary&quot;, beginning two billion years before the present time and continuing into the near future. The universe has no life-forms aside from the ancient Arisians, and few planets besides the Arisians&#x27; native world. The peaceful Arisians have foregone physical skills in order to develop contemplative mental power. The underlying assumption for this series, based on theories of stellar evolution extant at the time of the books&#x27; writing, is that planets form only rarely, and therefore our First and Second Galaxies, with their many billions of planets, are unique.

The Eddorians, a dictatorial, power-hungry race, come into our universe from an alien space-time continuum after observing that our galaxy and a sister galaxy (the Second Galaxy) are passing through each other. This will result in the formation of billions of planets and the development of life upon some of them. Dominance over these life forms would offer the Eddorians an opportunity to satisfy their lust for power and control.

Although the Eddorians have developed mental powers almost equal to those of the Arisians, they rely instead for the most part on physical power, which has come to be exercised on their behalf by a hierarchy of underling races. They see the many races in the universe, with which the Arisians were intending to build a peaceful civilization, as fodder for their power drive.

The Arisians detect the Eddorians&#x27; invasion of our universe and realize that the two races are too evenly matched for either to destroy the other without being destroyed themselves. The Eddorians do not detect the Arisians, who begin a covert breeding program on every world that can produce intelligent life, with particular emphasis on the four planets: Earth (Tellus), Velantia III, Rigel IV, and Palain VII, in the hope of creating a race that is capable of destroying the Eddorians.

&quot;Triplanetary&quot; incorporates the early history of that breeding program on Earth, illustrated with the lives of several warriors and soldiers, from ancient times to the discovery of the first interstellar space drive. It adds an additional short novel (originally published with the &quot;Triplanetary&quot; name) which is transitional to the novel &quot;First Lensman&quot;. It details some of the interactions and natures of two distinct breeding lines, one bearing some variant of the name &quot;Kinnison&quot;, and another distinguished by possessing &quot;red-bronze-auburn hair and gold-flecked, tawny eyes&quot;. The two lines do not co-mingle until the Arisian breeding plan brings them together.

The second book, &quot;First Lensman&quot;, concerns the early formation of the Galactic Patrol and the first Lens, given to First Lensman Virgil Samms of &quot;Tellus&quot; (Earth). Samms and Roderick Kinnison are members of the two breeding lines and they are both natural leaders, intelligent, forceful, and capable. The Arisians make it known that, if, Samms, the head of the Triplanetary Service, visits the Arisian planetary system he will be given the tool he needs to build the Galactic Patrol. That tool is the &quot;Lens&quot;. The Arisians further promise him that no entity unworthy of the Lens will ever be permitted to wear it, but that he and his successors will have to discover for themselves most of its abilities.

The Lens gives its wearer a variety of mental capabilities, including those needed to enforce the law on alien planets, and to bridge the communication gap between different life-forms. It can provide mind-reading and telepathic abilities. It cannot be worn by anyone other than its owner, will kill any other wearer, and even a brief touch is extremely painful.

Using the Lens as a means to test mental qualities and identify individuals able to help him, Virgil Samms visits races and species in other star systems, recruiting the best of them and forming the nucleus of a Galactic Patrol. Their opponents are discovered to be a widespread civilization based on dominance hierarchies and using organized crime to assume control of new planets.

The series contains some of the largest-scale space battles ever written. Entire worlds are almost casually destroyed. Huge fleets of spaceships fight bloody wars of attrition. Alien races of two galaxies sort themselves into the allied, Lens-bearing adherents of &quot;Civilization&quot; and the enemy &quot;Boskone&quot;.

Centuries pass, and eventually the final generations of the breeding program are born. On each of the four &quot;best&quot; planets, a single individual realizes the limits of his Arisian training and perceives the need to return to seek &quot;second stage&quot; training, which, it is later shown, to include the ability to slay by mental force alone; a &quot;sense of perception&quot; which allows seeing by direct awareness without the use of the visual sense; the ability to control minds undetectably, including the ability to alter memories untraceably; the ability to perfectly split attention in order to perform multiple tasks with simultaneous focus on each; and the ability to better integrate their minds for superior thinking.

As the breeding program nears its conclusion, humans are selected as the best choice; at the same time, the breeding programs of the other three planets are terminated, and their penultimates never meet their planned mates. Kimball Kinnison meets and marries the product of the complementary human breeding program, Clarrissa MacDougall. She is a beautiful, curvaceous, red-haired nurse, who eventually becomes the first human female to receive her own Lens. Their children, a boy and two pairs of twin sisters, grow up to be the five Children of the Lens. In their breeding, &quot;almost every strain of weakness in humanity is finally removed&quot;. They are born already possessing the powers taught to second-stage Lensmen. They are the only beings of Civilization ever to see Arisia as it truly is, and the only individuals developed over all the existence of billions of years able finally to penetrate the Eddorians&#x27; defense screens.

After undergoing advanced training, they are described as &quot;third-stage&quot; Lensmen, transcending humanity with mental scope and perceptions impossible for any normal person. Although newly adult, they are now expected to be more competent than the Arisians and to develop their own techniques and abilities &quot;about which we [the Arisians] know nothing&quot;.

The key discovery comes when they try mind-merging. They discover they can merge their minds to effectively form one mental entity called &quot;the Unit&quot;. The Arisians describe this as the &quot;most nearly perfect creation the universe has ever seen&quot; and state that they, who created it, are themselves almost entirely ignorant of its powers.

The Children of the Lens, together with the mental power of unknown millions of Lensmen of the Galactic Patrol, constitute the Arisians&#x27; intended means to destroy the Eddorians and make the universe safe for Civilization. The Galactic Patrol, summoned to work together in this way for the first time, contains billions of beings who in total can generate immense mental force. The Arisians add their own tremendous mental force to this. The Unit focuses the accumulated power onto one tiny point of the Eddorians&#x27; shields. The Eddorian shields are destroyed along with the Eddorian High Council. It is stated that this was the only thing the Arisians could not have done by themselves, but without its accomplishment the Eddorians would have eventually turned the tide and beaten the Arisians.

The Arisians remove themselves from the Cosmos in order to leave the Children of the Lens uninhibited in their future as the new guardians of Civilization.

==Publication history==

Originally, the series consisted of the four novels &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot;, &quot;Gray Lensman&quot;, &quot;Second Stage Lensmen&quot;, and &quot;Children of the Lens&quot;, published between 1937 and 1948 in the magazine &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;. In 1948, at the suggestion of Lloyd Arthur Eshbach (publisher of the original editions of the &quot;Lensman&quot; books as part of the Fantasy Press imprint), Smith rewrote his 1934 story &quot;Triplanetary&quot; to fit in with the &quot;Lensman&quot; series. &quot;First Lensman&quot; was written in 1950 to act as a link between &quot;Triplanetary&quot; and &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot; and finally, in the years up to 1954, Smith revised the rest of the series to remove inconsistencies between the original Lensman chronology and &quot;Triplanetary&quot;.

Except for the two prequel novels, the stories first appeared as serials in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, almost all of which were serialized under the editorship of John W. Campbell. They were later collected and reworked into the better-known series of books. The complete series in narrative sequence with original publication dates is as follows.

#&quot;Triplanetary&quot; (1948, originally published in four parts, January–April 1934, in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;)
#&quot;First Lensman&quot; (1950, Fantasy Press)
#&quot;Galactic Patrol&quot; (1950, originally published in six parts, September 1937 – February 1938, in &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;)
#&quot;Grey Lensman&quot; (1951, originally published in four parts, October 1939 – January 1940, &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;)
#&quot;Second Stage Lensmen&quot; (1953, originally published in four parts, November 1941 – February 1942, &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;)
#&quot;Children of the Lens&quot; (1954, originally published in four parts, November 1947 – February 1948, &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;)

;Side stories
:&quot;The Vortex Blaster&quot; (1960, republished as &quot;Masters of the Vortex&quot; in 1968)

==Sequels==
Using the same fictional universe, but not concerning the central plot, Smith wrote the &quot;Vortex Blaster&quot; stories, including &quot;Storm Cloud on Deka&quot; (June 1942) and &quot;The Vortex Blaster Makes War&quot; (October 1942) for &quot;Comet Stories&quot;, but the magazine closed after publishing &quot;Vortex Blaster&quot; (July 1941) and the rest were first published in &quot;Astonishing Stories&quot;. These stories and later additions were collected and published by Gnome Press as &quot;The Vortex Blaster&quot; in 1960 and later reprinted by Pyramid Books as &quot;Masters of the Vortex&quot; in 1968. They are set in the time between &quot;Second Stage Lensman&quot; and &quot;Children of the Lens&quot;.

In &quot;Larger Than Life&quot;, a tribute to Smith written by Robert A. Heinlein and included in &quot;Expanded Universe&quot;, Heinlein writes:
The Lensman [series] was left unfinished. There was to have been at least a seventh volume. As always, Doc had worked it out in great detail, but never (so far as I know) wrote it down ... because it was unpublishable — then. But he told me the ending orally and in private.

I shan&#x27;t repeat it; it is not my story. Possibly somewhere there is a manuscript — I &quot;hope&quot; so! All I will say is that the ending develops by inescapable logic from clues in &quot;Children of the Lens&quot;.

On July 14, 1965, Smith gave written permission to William B. Ellern to continue the &quot;Lensman&quot; series, which led to the publishing of &quot;Moon Prospector&quot; in 1966, &quot;New Lensman&quot; in 1975, which contained &quot;Moon Prospector&quot;, and &quot;Triplanetary Agent&quot; in 1978.

Three additional &quot;Lensmen&quot; novels that feature the alien Second-Stage Lensmen, known as the &quot;Second-Stage Lensman Trilogy&quot;, were written by David Kyle, published in paperback between 1980 and 1983 and reissued in 2004:
:*&quot;The Dragon Lensman&quot; (Worsel, the Velantian)
:*&quot;Lensman from Rigel&quot; (Tregonsee, the Rigellian)
:*&quot;Z-Lensman&quot; (Nadreck the Palainian)
:*A fourth novel, which was to have told the story of the Red Lensman, was discussed, but never completed.

The events in these books take place between &quot;Second-Stage Lensmen&quot; and &quot;Children of the Lens&quot; and refer to events and characters in &quot;Vortex Blaster&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===&quot;Lensman&quot; (1984 film)===

 is a 1984 Japanese animated film based on the Lensman novels. The movie is a loose adaptation of the series. It was dubbed by Harmony Gold in 1988. This was re-dubbed by Streamline Pictures in 1990 with most of the same voice actors.

===&quot;Galactic Patrol Lensman&quot;===

 is a Japanese anime television series based on the Lensman novels. The 25-episode series aired from October 6, 1984 to August 8, 1985 in Japan.

===Comics===
====In Japan====
Both the 1984 long-running theatrical animation and the animated TV series were adapted into manga. The movie&#x27;s adaptation was created by Moribi Murano and divided into three volumes. The TV series adaptation by Mitsuru Miura was serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; and then reprinted in three tankōbon pocket volumes. No English translation of these two manga has been published so far.

====Eternity Comics (1990–1991)====
Initially, Eternity&#x27;s &quot;Lensman&quot; comics run consisted almost entirely of adaptations of the &quot;Lensman&quot; TV episodes, but they also began writing additional material.
* &quot;Lensman: The Secret of the Lens&quot;
: Six issues, written by Paul O&#x27;Conner, drawn by Tim Eldred, ink by Paul Young, cover art by Jason Waltrip.
* &quot;Lensman: War of the Galaxies&quot;
: Seven issues, written by Paul O&#x27;Conner and drawn and inks by Tim Eldred.
* &quot;Lensman: Galactic Patrol&quot;
:Five issues, written by Tim Eldred, drawn by Tim Eldred and inks by Paul Young and Ken Branch.

===Film===
In 2008, Ron Howard&#x27;s Imagine Entertainment and Universal Pictures began negotiations with the author&#x27;s estate for rights to film the Lensman series. The negotiations were for an 18-month renewable option. At the WonderCon convention in San Francisco in February, J. Michael Straczynski, the creator of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, confirmed that Howard had acquired the rights and also hinted that he was involved in the project. Although the work on the project began that June, Straczynski later wrote in April 2014 that Universal had scrapped the project, citing excessive cost, and that the rights had reverted to the estate.

===Games===
The series has been adapted into the board wargames &quot;Lensman&quot; and &quot;Triplanetary&quot;. The first of these was designed by Philip N. Pritchard.

&quot;GURPS Lensman: Starkly Astounding Space-Opera Adventure&quot; for the GURPS roleplaying system was produced in 1993 by Steve Jackson Games.

==Homages and parodies==
With Smith&#x27;s knowledge, the parody &quot;Backstage Lensman&quot; was written by Randall Garrett in 1949. Garrett also referred to the Lenses in his &quot;Lord Darcy&quot; stories, in which similar lenses are the badges of the King&#x27;s Messengers, invented by the wizard &quot;Sir Edward Elmer&quot;.

Harry Harrison wrote the humorous and comprehensive parody &quot;Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers&quot; in 1973.

In the DC Comics universe, the Green Lantern Corps bears many parallels to the Lensmen, though the original editor (Julius Schwartz) denied any connection. Later writers would add characters that directly referenced the Lensman series, such as the extraterrestrial Green Lanterns Arisia and Eddore.

In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, the protagonists encounter a Lensman. The novel&#x27;s alternate version, &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot;, has an extended version of the Lensman sequence.

<doc id="219885" wikidata="Q1831598" url="?curid=219885" title="Ned Overend">
<text>Edmund (&quot;Ned&quot;) Overend (born August 20, 1955) is an American former professional cross-country mountain bike racer. He is a six-time NORBA cross-country mountain bike national champion who became the first-ever cross-country world champion by winning the inaugural UCI Mountain Bike World Championship in 1990. Overend was inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1990 and into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Cycling career==
The son of an American diplomat, Overend was born in Taipei, Taiwan and raised in Ethiopia and Iran. He attended high school in San Diego, California and was involved in motocross racing. Overend moved to Durango, Colorado in the early 1980s where he first became involved in cycling by entering Durango’s Iron Horse Classic, a 47-mile road race with 6,700 feet of climbing along a narrow gauge railroad. From road racing, he eventually moved on to mountain bike racing, where his previous motocross experience combined with his physical fitness from road racing made him an exceptional competitor.

Overend was hired to race for the Schwinn factory racing team in 1984 and won two consecutive NORBA Mountain Biking National Championships for the team in 1986 and 1987. He then signed a contract to race for Specialized Bicycles and went on to win the NORBA Mountain Biking National Championship in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992. At the age of 40, Overend made an attempt to qualify for the United States Olympic team to compete in the inaugural Olympic Cross-Country Mountain Biking competition in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. He needed to finish the qualifier race in fourth place to qualify for the Olympic team alongside Tinker Juarez but, one and a half miles from the finish line, he suffered a flat tire and finished in eighth place.

Even though he retired from professional mountain bike competition in 1996, he continued competing in endurance competitions, winning the XTERRA Triathlon in 1998 and 1999 and competing in regular road triathlons. He won the U.S. National Winter Triathlon Championship in 2000 and the UCI Masters Cyclo-cross World Championship in 2012. In 2015, Overend won the first-ever U.S. Fat Bike championship. During his professional mountain biking career, Overend earned the nicknames &quot;Deadly Nedly&quot; and &quot;The Lung&quot;, because he was very difficult to beat and for his exceptional aerobic endurance at altitude (especially so for a man of his age), respectively. He is the current captain of the Specialized Cross Country Team.

Overend appeared in &quot;the world&#x27;s first mountain biking video, aptly named, The Great Mountain Biking Video released in 1988 by New &amp; Unique Videos of San Diego, California. Overend also appears in competition sequences of &quot;The Sun Valley Mountain Bike Challenge,&quot; a video chronicle of that year&#x27;s NORBA Championships also released in 1988. He also appeared in a mountain-bike race video entitled &quot;Battle At Durango: The First-Ever World Mountain Biking Championships&quot; videotaped in Durango, Colorado in 1990, and released by New &amp; Unique Videos in 1991.

She created a small media sensation in the 1970s by presenting works purportedly dictated to her by Claude Debussy, Edvard Grieg, Franz Liszt, Franz Schubert, Frédéric Chopin, Igor Stravinsky, Johann Sebastian Bach, Johannes Brahms, Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann and Sergei Rachmaninoff.

==Life==
Rosemary Isabel Dickeson was born in London in 1916. She claimed to have been only seven years old when she was first introduced to the world of dead musicians. She reported that a spirit with long white hair and a flowing black cassock appeared and told her he was a composer and would make her a famous musician one day. She did not know who he was until, about ten years later, she saw a picture of Franz Liszt. Many other members of Brown&#x27;s family were allegedly psychic, including her parents and grandparents.

She worked for the Post Office from the age of 15. In 1948 she acquired a second-hand upright piano, and took some lessons for three years. In 1952 she married Charles Brown, a government scientist. They had a son and a daughter before her husband died in 1961.

Then in 1964 Liszt supposedly renewed contact and Brown began transcribing original compositions she said were dictated to her by great musicians of the past. Brown transcribed pieces from Johannes Brahms, Johann Sebastian Bach, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Franz Schubert, Edvard Grieg, Claude Debussy, Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Liszt. These included a 40-page sonata she attributed to Schubert, a Fantaisie-Impromptu in three movements she attributed to Chopin, 12 songs she attributed to Schubert, and two sonatas and two symphonies she attributed to Beethoven.

Brown claimed that each composer had his own way of dictating to her: Liszt controlled her hands for a few bars at a time, and then she wrote down the notes; Chopin told her the notes and pushed her hands on to the right keys; Schubert tried to sing his compositions; and Beethoven and Bach simply dictated the notes. She claimed the composers spoke to her in English.

==Critical reception==

Brown&#x27;s claims about spirit communication were disputed by sceptics, although there were a number of musicians and musicologists who supported her claims. Humphrey Searle, who was an authority on Liszt, wrote in his autobiography &quot;Quadrille with a Raven&quot;, referring to &quot;Grubelei&quot;, a piece inspired by Liszt: &#x27;It is certainly in keeping with Liszt&#x27;s experimental style, being mostly written in single notes in each hand; it is highly chromatic, and one hand is written in 5/4 time against 3/2 in the other. The latter is not a thing that Liszt ever did as far as I know, but it is the sort of thing he might have done as I said in my broadcast, which was reproduced on this record sleeve without my knowledge! Since then Fiona and I have got to know Rosemary well and believe her to be perfectly genuine. Even if the pieces dictated to her by dead composers are not masterpieces - although some of them are very nice works - she has had no technical training in composition and could not possibly produce pastiches like, say, those by Joseph Cooper in his TV programme &quot;Face the Music&quot;.

Professor Ian Parrott was also a supporter, and participated in a documentary, and wrote Rosemary Brown&#x27;s obituary for the Guardian: &#x27;…&quot;Grübelei&quot; (meditation), partly dictated under the watchful gaze of BBC reporter Peter Dorling and a television studio crew, is undoubtedly a most spectacular and unusual piece. It has strong harmonies, cross-rhythms and occasional instructions in French - a point conferring authenticity, but difficult to fake. The composer and Liszt specialist Humphrey Searle said: &quot;We must be grateful to Mrs Brown for making it available to us.&quot; &#x27;

After studying her compositions, musicologists and psychologists came to the conclusion they were the work of Brown&#x27;s own subconscious. Leonard Zusne and Warren H. Jones in their book &quot;Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking&quot; (1989) noted that &quot;Brown wrote hundreds of pieces of music dictated by the various composers. They were passable works, entirely in the style of these composers, but appeared to be simply reworkings of existing pieces.&quot;

Professor of psychology John Sloboda wrote that Brown&#x27;s music offers &quot;the most convincing case of unconscious composition on a large scale.&quot;

Psychologist Robert Kastenbaum analysed Brown&#x27;s music compositions and came to doubt that they were dictated to Brown by spirits of well known composers. According to Kastenbaum:

Kastenbaum suggested the composers were secondary personalities of Brown herself.

PhD student Erico Bonfim studied a particular sonata by Schubert produced by Brown and said: &quot;…I chose to investigate a sonata attributed to Schubert because Schubert has a very special and particular way of dealing with sonata form. What is very impressive, in this sonata I analysed, we can see all the most important characteristics of Schubert&#x27;s treatment of sonata form. So this is certainly not a superficial imitation. So when the sceptics claimed that she was making just a superficial imitation, something maybe improvisatory and so on, I don&#x27;t believe they were accurate – at least regarding some of her better pieces.&quot; 

Brown maintained that she had never had any musical training aside from a few piano lessons, though paranormal investigator Harry Edwards says:

According to the psychologist Andrew Neher:

Musicologist Denis Matthews described her music as &quot;charming pastiches&quot; and suggested she was re-creating compositions. Similarly Alan Rich, music critic of &quot;New York&quot; magazine, having heard a privately issued record of Brown&#x27;s piano pieces, concluded that they were just sub-standard re-workings of some of their purported composers&#x27; better-known compositions.

Concert pianists Peter Katin, Philip Gammon, Howard Shelley, Cristina Ortiz and John Lill have all performed her music.

Brown was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 drama, &quot;The Lambeth Waltz&quot; by Daniel Thurman, first broadcast in 2017.

An LP spoofing her work, &quot;Rosemary Brown Psyches Again!&quot; was issued in 1982 by Enharmonic Records.

==Publications==
Rosemary Brown published three books:

*&quot;Immortals at My Elbow&quot; Bachman &amp; Turner, 1974;

<text>An intracranial aneurysm, also known as a cerebral aneurysm, is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by a localized dilation or ballooning of a blood vessel in the brain due to a weakness in the vessel wall. These aneurysms can occur in any part of the brain but are most commonly found in the arteries of the cerebral arterial circle. The risk of rupture varies with the size and location of the aneurysm, with those in the posterior circulation being more prone to rupture.

Cerebral aneurysms are classified by size into small, large, giant, and super-giant, and by shape into saccular (berry), fusiform, and microaneurysms. Saccular aneurysms are the most common type and can result from various risk factors, including genetic conditions, hypertension, smoking, and drug abuse.

Symptoms of an unruptured aneurysm are often minimal, but a ruptured aneurysm can cause severe headaches, nausea, vision impairment, and loss of consciousness, leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Treatment options include surgical clipping and endovascular coiling, both aimed at preventing further bleeding.

Diagnosis typically involves imaging techniques such as CT or MR angiography and lumbar puncture to detect subarachnoid hemorrhage. Prognosis depends on factors like the size and location of the aneurysm and the patient’s age and health, with larger aneurysms having a higher risk of rupture and poorer outcomes. 

Advances in medical imaging have led to increased detection of unruptured aneurysms, prompting ongoing research into their management and the development of predictive tools for rupture risk.

==Classification==

Cerebral aneurysms are classified both by size and shape. Small aneurysms have a diameter of less than 15 mm. Larger aneurysms include those classified as large (15 to 25 mm), giant (25 to 50 mm) (0.98 inches to 1.97 inches), and super-giant (over 50 mm).

===Berry (saccular) aneurysms===
Saccular aneurysms, also known as berry aneurysms, appear as a round outpouching and are the most common form of cerebral aneurysm. Causes include connective tissue disorders, polycystic kidney disease, arteriovenous malformations, untreated hypertension, tobacco smoking, cocaine and amphetamines, intravenous drug abuse (can cause infectious mycotic aneurysms), alcoholism, heavy caffeine intake, head trauma, and infection in the arterial wall from bacteremia (mycotic aneurysms).

===Fusiform aneurysms===
Fusiform dolichoectatic aneurysms represent a widening of a segment of an artery around the entire blood vessel, rather than just arising from a side of an artery&#x27;s wall. They have an estimated annual risk of rupture between 1.6 and 1.9 percent.

===Microaneurysms===
Microaneurysms, also known as Charcot–Bouchard aneurysms, typically occur in small blood vessels (less than 300 micrometre diameter), most often the lenticulostriate vessels of the basal ganglia, and are associated with chronic hypertension. Charcot–Bouchard aneurysms are a common cause of intracranial hemorrhage.

==Signs and symptoms==
A small, unchanging aneurysm will produce few, if any, symptoms. Before a larger aneurysm ruptures, the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, or no symptoms at all.

=== Subarachnoid bleed ===
If an aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks into the space around the brain. This is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Onset is usually sudden without prodrome, classically presenting as a &quot;thunderclap headache&quot; worse than previous headaches. Symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage differ depending on the site and size of the aneurysm. Symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include:
* a sudden severe headache that can last from several hours to days
* nausea and vomiting
* drowsiness, confusion and/or loss of consciousness
* visual abnormalities
* meningism
* dizziness

Almost all aneurysms rupture at their apex. This leads to hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space and sometimes in brain parenchyma. Minor leakage from aneurysm may precede rupture, causing warning headaches. About 60% of patients die immediately after rupture. Larger aneurysms have a greater tendency to rupture, though most ruptured aneurysms are less than 10 mm in diameter.

===Microaneurysms===
A ruptured microaneurysm may cause an intracerebral hemorrhage, presenting as a focal neurological deficit.

Rebleeding, hydrocephalus (the excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid), vasospasm (spasm, or narrowing, of the blood vessels), or multiple aneurysms may also occur. The risk of rupture from a cerebral aneurysm varies according to the size of an aneurysm, with the risk rising as the aneurysm size increases.

=== Vasospasm ===
Vasospasm, referring to blood vessel constriction, can occur secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage following a ruptured aneurysm. This is most likely to occur within 21 days and is seen radiologically within 60% of such patients. The vasospasm is thought to be secondary to the apoptosis of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils that become trapped in the subarachnoid space. These cells initially invade the subarachnoid space from the circulation in order to phagocytose the hemorrhaged red blood cells. Following apoptosis, it is thought there is a massive degranulation of vasoconstrictors, including endothelins and free radicals, that cause the vasospasm.

==Risk factors==
Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms. Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.

Other acquired associations with intracranial aneurysms include head trauma and infections.

===Genetic associations===
Coarctation of the aorta is also a known risk factor, as is arteriovenous malformation. Genetic conditions associated with connective tissue disease may also be associated with the development of aneurysms. This includes:
* autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,
* neurofibromatosis type I,
* Marfan syndrome,
* multiple endocrine neoplasia type I,
* pseudoxanthoma elasticum,
* hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and
* Ehlers-Danlos syndrome types II and IV.

Specific genes have also had reported association with the development of intracranial aneurysms, including perlecan, elastin, collagen type 1 A2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, endothelin receptor A and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor. Recently, several genetic loci have been identified as relevant to the development of intracranial aneurysms. These include 1p34–36, 2p14–15, 7q11, 11q25, and 19q13.1–13.3.

==Pathophysiology==
Aneurysm means an outpouching of a blood vessel wall that is filled with blood. Aneurysms occur at a point of weakness in the vessel wall. This can be because of acquired disease or hereditary factors. The repeated trauma of blood flow against the vessel wall presses against the point of weakness and causes the aneurysm to enlarge. As described by the law of Young-Laplace, the increasing area increases tension against the aneurysmal walls, leading to enlargement. In addition, a combination of computational fluid dynamics and morphological indices have been proposed as reliable predictors of cerebral aneurysm rupture.

Both high and low wall shear stress of flowing blood can cause aneurysm and rupture. However, the mechanism of action is still unknown. It is speculated that low shear stress causes growth and rupture of large aneurysms through inflammatory response while high shear stress causes growth and rupture of small aneurysm through mural response (response from the blood vessel wall). Other risk factors that contributes to the formation of aneurysm are: cigarette smoking, hypertension, female gender, family history of cerebral aneurysm, infection, and trauma. Damage to structural integrity of the arterial wall by shear stress causes an inflammatory response with the recruitment of T cells, macrophages, and mast cells. The inflammatory mediators are: interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, prostaglandin E2, complement system, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and angiotensin II. However, smooth muscle cells from the tunica media layer of the artery moved into the tunica intima, where the function of the smooth muscle cells changed from contractile function into pro-inflammatory function. This causes the fibrosis of the arterial wall, with reduction of number of smooth muscle cells, abnormal collagen synthesis, resulting in a thinning of the arterial wall and the formation of aneurysm and rupture. No specific gene loci has been identified to be associated with cerebral aneurysms.

Generally, aneurysms larger than 7 mm in diameter should be treated because they are prone for rupture. Meanwhile, aneurysms less than 7 mm arise from the anterior and posterior communicating artery and are more easily ruptured when compared to aneurysms arising from other locations.

===Saccular aneurysms===
Saccular aneurysms are almost always the result of hereditary weaknesses in blood vessels and typically occur within the arteries of the circle of Willis, in order of frequency affecting the following arteries:
* Anterior communicating artery
* Posterior communicating artery
* Middle cerebral artery
* Internal carotid artery
* Tip of basilar artery

Saccular aneurysms tend to have a lack of tunica media and elastic lamina around their dilated locations (congenital), with a wall of sac made up of thickened hyalinized intima and adventitia. In addition, some parts of the brain vasculature are inherently weak—particularly areas along the circle of Willis, where small communicating vessels link the main cerebral vessels. These areas are particularly susceptible to saccular aneurysms. Approximately 25% of patients have multiple aneurysms, predominantly when there is a familial pattern.

==Diagnosis==
Once suspected, intracranial aneurysms can be diagnosed radiologically using magnetic resonance or CT angiography. But these methods have limited sensitivity for diagnosis of small aneurysms, and often cannot be used to specifically distinguish them from infundibular dilations without performing a formal angiogram. The determination of whether an aneurysm is ruptured is critical to diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) is the gold standard technique for determining aneurysm rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage). Once an LP is performed, the CSF is evaluated for RBC count, and presence or absence of xanthochromia.

== Treatment ==
Emergency treatment for individuals with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm generally includes restoring deteriorating respiration and reducing intracranial pressure. Currently there are two treatment options for securing intracranial aneurysms: surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. If possible, either surgical clipping or endovascular coiling is typically performed within the first 24 hours after bleeding to occlude the ruptured aneurysm and reduce the risk of recurrent hemorrhage.

While a large meta-analysis found the outcomes and risks of surgical clipping and endovascular coiling to be statistically similar, no consensus has been reached. In particular, the large randomised control trial International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial appears to indicate a higher rate of recurrence when intracerebral aneurysms are treated using endovascular coiling. Analysis of data from this trial has indicated a 7% lower eight-year mortality rate with coiling, a high rate of aneurysm recurrence in aneurysms treated with coiling—from 28.6 to 33.6% within a year, a 6.9 times greater rate of late retreatment for coiled aneurysms, and a rate of rebleeding 8 times higher than surgically clipped aneurysms.

=== Surgical clipping ===
Aneurysms can be treated by clipping the base of the aneurysm with a specially-designed clip. Whilst this is typically carried out by craniotomy, a new endoscopic endonasal approach is being trialled. Surgical clipping was introduced by Walter Dandy of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1937.
After clipping, a catheter angiogram or CTA can be performed to confirm complete clipping.

===Endovascular coiling===
Endovascular coiling refers to the insertion of platinum coils into the aneurysm. A catheter is inserted into a blood vessel, typically the femoral artery, and passed through blood vessels into the cerebral circulation and the aneurysm. Coils are pushed into the aneurysm, or released into the blood stream ahead of the aneurysm. Upon depositing within the aneurysm, the coils expand and initiate a thrombotic reaction within the aneurysm. If successful, this prevents further bleeding from the aneurysm. In the case of broad-based aneurysms, a stent may be passed first into the parent artery to serve as a scaffold for the coils.

===Cerebral bypass surgery===
Cerebral bypass surgery was developed in the 1960s in Switzerland by Gazi Yaşargil. When a patient has an aneurysm involving a blood vessel or a tumor at the base of the skull wrapping around a blood vessel, surgeons eliminate the problem vessel by replacing it with an artery from another part of the body.

== Prognosis ==
Outcomes depend on the size of the aneurysm. Small aneurysms (less than 7 mm) have a low risk of rupture and increase in size slowly. The risk of rupture is less than one percent for aneurysms of this size.

The prognosis for a ruptured cerebral aneurysm depends on the extent and location of the aneurysm, the person&#x27;s age, general health, and neurological condition. Some individuals with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm die from the initial bleeding. Other individuals with cerebral aneurysm recover with little or no neurological deficit. The most significant factors in determining outcome are the Hunt and Hess grade, and age. Generally patients with Hunt and Hess grade I and II hemorrhage on admission to the emergency room and patients who are younger within the typical age range of vulnerability can anticipate a good outcome, without death or permanent disability. Older patients and those with poorer Hunt and Hess grades on admission have a poor prognosis. Generally, about two-thirds of patients have a poor outcome, death, or permanent disability.

Increased availability and greater access to medical imaging has caused a rising number of asymptomatic, unruptured cerebral aneurysms to be discovered incidentally during medical imaging investigations. Unruptured aneurysms may be managed by endovascular clipping or stenting. For those subjects that underwent follow-up for the unruptured aneurysm, computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain can be done yearly. Recently, an increasing number of aneurysm features have been evaluated in their ability to predict aneurysm rupture status, including aneurysm height, aspect ratio, height-to-width ratio, inflow angle, deviations from ideal spherical or elliptical forms, and radiomics morphological features.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of intracranial aneurysm is about 1–5% (10 million to 12 million persons in the United States) and the incidence is 1 per 10,000 persons per year in the United States (approximately 27,000), with 30- to 60-year-olds being the age group most affected. Intracranial aneurysms occur more in women, by a ratio of 3 to 2, and are rarely seen in pediatric populations.

<doc id="219918" wikidata="Q541664" url="?curid=219918" title="Pelagic cormorant">
<text>The pelagic cormorant (Urile pelagicus), also known as Baird&#x27;s cormorant or violet-green cormorant, is a small member of the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae. Analogous to other smallish cormorants, it is also called the pelagic shag occasionally. This seabird lives along the coasts of the northern Pacific; during winter it can also be found in the open ocean. Pelagic cormorants have relatively short wings due to their need for economical movement underwater, and consequently have the highest flight costs of any bird.

It was formerly classified in the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;, but a 2014 study supported reclassifying it and several other Pacific cormorant species into the genus &quot;Urile&quot;. The IOC followed this classification in 2021.

==Description==

This is a smallish cormorant which measures in length, with a wingspan of about and a weight of when fully grown. Adults in nonbreeding plumage are all-black with a metallic iridescence. In breeding plumage they grow two short crests (one on top of the head and one at the nape), white thighs, and scattered white filoplumes on the head and neck. The long thin bill and the large feet with all-webbed toes are black throughout the year, while the patch of dark naked skin below the eye turns a vivid magenta in the breeding season.

Males and females do not differ in appearance, though the latter is a bit smaller. Immature birds lack iridescence and are dark brown, grading into slightly lighter brown on the underside.

The widely sympatric red-faced cormorant (&quot;U. urile&quot;) looks very similar. Breeding adults are easily told apart by the amount of naked facial skin, which does not noticeably extend beyond the eye in &quot;U. pelagicus&quot;, but extends to above the bill and above and behind the eye in &quot;U. urile&quot;; the latter species also has larger crests. Juveniles and nonbreeding adults of the two species are often indistinguishable even to trained observers when in mixed flocks, or if they cannot be observed up close. In the former case, the large naked face &quot;mask&quot; and light bill of &quot;U. urile&quot; can be easily recognized, in the latter case its larger size (though male pelagic cormorants can be as large as female red-faced cormorants). Unlike the red-faced cormorant, the present species usually calls out before taking off, particularly during the breeding season. In courtship display, nest material is typically torn and moved about (which &quot;U. urile&quot; might not do) and the males apparently do not bow their heads before the females as &quot;U. urile&quot; males do. Other North Pacific cormorants and shags are larger, with a thicker bill, and/or lack the white thighs in breeding plumage.

==Range==
The pelagic cormorant inhabits the shores and the neritic zone of the North Pacific. Its North American range extends from Alaska to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico. It furthermore is found on the Aleutian and other Bering Strait islands, and from the Russian Far East Chukchi Peninsula via Sakhalin south to Kamchatka, and ultimately Kyūshū (though not the rest of Japan). The subarctic populations are migratory, while the birds from temperate and subtropical regions only disperse locally after breeding, but even so Asian birds may reach China or Korea. Vagrants have been recorded in the Hawaiian Islands.

==Ecology and biology==
===Diet===

On land, pelagic cormorants are rather clumsy and walk with the high-stepped waddling gait typical for all Sulae except darters; after landing they often scratch the ground, as is typical for cormorants. When they feel threatened, they will dart their bills at the intruder, and shake their heads and make a gargling noise. This bird forages by swimming to locate prey, then diving and going after it underwater, propelled by its feet and steering with the wings. It can dive as deep as to feed on or near the seafloor. Typical hunting grounds are sheltered inlets and bays; especially outside the breeding season they can also be seen fishing out at sea. They prefer to hunt in the vicinity of kelp beds or among rocks. Typical prey are smallish, bottom-living non-schooling fishes, such as &quot;Ammodytes&quot; sand eels, sculpins (Cottidae), gunnels (Pholidae) and &quot;Sebastes&quot; (rockfish). Apart from fish, small crustaceans – in particular shrimp – are also often eaten. It has been observed to join mixed-species feeding flocks going after schools of young Pacific herrings (&quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;). Like all cormorants, due to their vestigial uropygial gland their plumage is not waterproof. Thus, the birds return to a safe place after foraging to preen and dry their feathers, typically adopting a spread-winged posture.

===Breeding===
The pelagic cormorant breeds on rocky shores and islands. They do not form large colonies, but smaller groups may nest together. In some cases these birds alternate between two or three nesting sites in a region from one year to another. The nest is built at the cliff face, usually on ledges, less often in crevices or caves. The nest is built from stringy plants, such as grasses or seaweed, and held together by the birds&#x27; own guano. Once the birds have found a nest site they like, they tend to remain faithful to it for the rest of their lives. The nest is repaired and improved in each season if need be; it can thus grow up to deep.

Males searching for a mate or bonding with their partner give an elaborate courtship display, as is typical for Sulae. Like all cormorants, this includes stretching the gular sac with the hyoid bone and repeated &quot;yawning&quot;; as in many but not all cormorants, the pelagic cormorant&#x27;s display furthermore includes arching the neck and hopping, lifting the folded wings and rapidly fluttering them to show the white thigh patches. During the yawning display, the head is thrown back and calls are given which differ between males and females; when the birds land, males and females give an identical call. Otherwise, the displays are given in silence.

The clutch is generally between two and five eggs, most often three or four, but clutches of up to seven eggs have been recorded. Incubation lasts for 3 weeks to one month. At hatching, the young weigh somewhat more than an ounce (35 g) and are naked, but they soon grow sooty-gray down feathers. In normal years, all young of a typical clutch may be raised successfully, but less than four rarely fledge. On the other hand, during unfavorable phases of the Pacific decadal oscillation, most pairs manage to raise only two young at most. They reach sexual maturity at two years of age, and a maximum age of almost eighteen years has been recorded in the wild.

==Status==
This numerous and widespread species is not considered threatened by the IUCN. The bulk of its population is found in the relatively inaccessible waters of the Bering Sea region; about 50,000 each breed in the Kuril Islands, the Bering Sea islands, and the U.S. state of Alaska and its offshore islands (including the Aleuts). About 25,000 breed down the Pacific coast of North America, some 60% of which are found in California. Local populations may be all but wiped out temporarily by oil spills, and on a larger scale competition with gillnet fisheries and drowning in such nets is putting a limit to its stocks.

The acanthocephalan parasite &quot;Andracantha phalacrocoracis&quot; was described from this cormorant.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae has traditionally been included – like all other birds with fully webbed toes – in the Pelecaniformes. But the namesake pelicans (Pelecanidae) are actually closer relatives of storks (Ciconiidae) than of cormorants. Hence, it has been proposed to separate the Phalacrocoracidae and relatives as order Phalacrocoraciformes. More recent evidence indicates that they and the darters actually belong in the order Suliformes, alongside the boobies and gannets.
This species was formerly placed in the catch-all genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;. Modern authors were previously reserved about uniting all cormorants in one &quot;wastebin genus&quot;, but most revisions published had on phylogenetic merit. Though it was proposed to place the pelagic cormorant in &quot;Stictocarbo&quot; for example, this is quite certainly wrong, as the present species is by no means closely related to the spotted shag (&quot;P. punctatus&quot;), the type species of &quot;Stictocarbo&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Leucocarbo&quot; would refer to the group around the imperial shag (&quot;P. atriceps&quot;) complex, which occurs on the opposite end of the Earth from &quot;P. pelagicus&quot;. The supposed &quot;cliff shag&quot; subfamily Leucocarboninae is entirely paraphyletic cannot be accepted as originally circumscribed. If subfamilies are to be accepted in the Phalacrocoracidae, the pelagic shag and its relatives would go in the Phalacrocoracinae like most Northern Hemisphere cormorants and shags, while Leucocarboninae would include mainly Southern Hemisphere taxa.

Another theory held that the genus name for the pelagic cormorant, if &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; was to be split up, would be &quot;Compsohalieus&quot;. This name would apply to the group around its type species (Brandt&#x27;s cormorant, &quot;P. penicillatus&quot;). This is a North Pacific clade, which apart from Brandt&#x27;s and the pelagic cormorant also includes the red-faced cormorant (&quot;P. urile&quot;) and probably also the extinct spectacled cormorant (&quot;P. perspicillatus&quot;). They all have black feet, and in breeding plumage grow white filoplumes on the head and/or neck, and usually also two head-crests and white thigh patches like the present species does. They also share the back-thrown head during the &quot;yawning&quot; and the rapid wing-flutter in courtship display. Among the &quot;Compsohalieus&quot; group, the red-faced cormorant is the sister species of &quot;P. pelagicus&quot;. Apart from looking almost alike, these two species also &quot;yawn&quot; many times in a row instead of giving the display just once, twist their bodies before taking flight during courtship, and the male and female post-landing calls are identical. The point-and-gargle response to threats is also an apomorphy of these two species. In 2014, a study was published supporting this treatment, albeit classifying the species in the genus &quot;Urile&quot; rather than &quot;Compsohalieus&quot;. The IUCN, BirdLife International, and the IOC have since followed this classification, legitimizing it.

Its former scientific name was the literal Latinized Ancient Greek equivalent of the common name: &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; is an ancient term for cormorants; literally, it means &quot;bald raven&quot;, from &quot;falakrós&quot; (φᾶλακρός, &quot;bald&quot;) + &quot;kórax&quot; (κόραξ, &quot;raven&quot;). &quot;Pelagicus&quot; is – like the English loanword &quot;pelagic&quot; – derived from (πελᾶγιος, &quot;of the open seas&quot;). &quot;Compsohalieus&quot;, meanwhile, means &quot;sleek fisher&quot;; it derives from (κομψός, &quot;elegant&quot; or &quot;sleek&quot;) + &#x27; (ἇλιεύς, &quot;fisherman&quot;). &quot;Urile&quot; is a term coined by Bonaparte in 1855 as the species name for the red-faced cormorant.

===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are generally recognized. The difference between them is slight and generally agrees with Bergmann&#x27;s Rule:
* Urile pelagicus pelagicus – Northern pelagic cormorant. northwest Pacific east to south Alaska. The larger subspecies (but see below).
* Urile pelagicus resplendens – Southern pelagic cormorant. British Columbia to northwest Mexico. The smaller subspecies.

The Amchitka cormorant or Kenyon&#x27;s shag (U. kenyoni) is a supposed species that was presumed to be closely related to the pelagic cormorant. It was described from the bones of three individuals snared in fishing nets in the late 1950s at Constantine Harbor on Amchitka in the Aleutian Islands. The specific name &quot;kenyoni&quot; honors USFWS biologist Karl W. Kenyon, who collected the type specimen USNM 431164 on 22 February 1959. Some bones from prehistoric middens on Amchitka were also attributed to this taxon. As distinctive cormorants were never seen alive in recent years on Amchitka, it was conjectured by some that Kenyon&#x27;s shag might have gone extinct in the 1960s–1970s (marine pollution and overfishing would be possible reasons).

However, a subsequent analysis of a larger number of comparison specimens of the pelagic cormorant – mainly from birds that fell victim to the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill – determined that the bones were attributable to small females of the latter species, and that their apparent distinctness was due to the original canonical analysis being distorted by insufficient specimens. The researchers also found that contrary to what was generally assumed, pelagic cormorants from the Aleutians were generally small birds – as opposed to western Alaskan individuals, which are usually very large. If the Aleutian population were to be considered a distinct subspecies, the name &quot;kenyoni&quot; would apply. Verification of subspecies status would require DNA sequence analyses however, since the differences in morphology are not large and there is much variation between individuals.

In 2003, during an USFWS survey three small pelagic cormorants whose bills appeared to be red were noted at Karab Cove on Agattu Island. It may be that these were &quot;kenyoni&quot;, but whether the bill color distinguishes the presumed subspecies or whether it is due to a simple mutation has not been determined. The large birds from the Prince William Sound region were formerly called &quot;U. p. robustus&quot;, but are not considered distinct today. Since there appear to be at least two recognizable and allopatric size groups in the northern subspecies alone, more research is clearly necessary.

<text>The Brooks Range (Gwich&#x27;in: &quot;Gwazhał&quot;) is a mountain range in far northern North America stretching some from west to east across northern Alaska into Canada&#x27;s Yukon Territory. Reaching a peak elevation of on Mount Isto, the range is believed to be approximately 126 million years old.

In the United States, these mountains are considered a subrange of the Rocky Mountains, whereas in Canada they are considered separate, as the northern border of the Rocky Mountains is considered to be the Liard River far to the south in the province of British Columbia.

While the range is mostly uninhabited, the Dalton Highway and Trans-Alaska Pipeline System run through the Atigun Pass (1,415 m, 4,643 ft) on their way to the oil fields at Prudhoe Bay on Alaska&#x27;s North Slope. The Alaska Native villages of Anaktuvuk and Arctic Village, as well as the very small communities of Coldfoot, Wiseman, Bettles, and Chandalar, are the range&#x27;s only settlements. In the far west, near the Wulik River in the De Long Mountains is the Red Dog mine, the largest zinc mine in the world.

The range was named by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1925 after Alfred Hulse Brooks, chief USGS geologist for Alaska from 1903 to 1924.

Various historical records also referred to the range as the Arctic Mountains, Hooper Mountains, Meade Mountains and Meade River Mountains. The Canadian portion of the range is officially called the British Mountains. Ivvavik National Park is located in Canada&#x27;s British Mountains.

==History==
Bob Marshall explored the North Fork Koyukuk River area of the range in 1929. He named Mount Doonerak, explaining &quot;the name Doonerak I took from an Eskimo word which means a spirit or, as they would translate it, a devil.&quot; Marshall described the mountain as, a &quot;towering, black, unscalable-looking giant, the highest peak in this section of the Brooks Range.&quot;

==Ecology==

The Brooks Range forms the northernmost drainage divide in North America, separating streams flowing into the Arctic Ocean and the North Pacific. The range roughly delineates the summer position of the Arctic front. It represents the northern extent of the tree line, with little beyond isolated balsam poplar stands occurring north of the continental drainage divide. Trembling aspen and white spruce also occur north of the Brooks Range, though they are limited to sites that have been disturbed by human activity. Southern slopes have some cover of black spruce, &quot;Picea mariana&quot;, marking the northern limit of those trees. As the global mean temperature increases, tree line has been observed to move further north, changing the boundaries of where these trees are found. An increase in shrub abundance is also being experienced in areas which were previously dominated by tundra, impacting the ecology of the area.

As one of the most remote and least-disturbed wildernesses of North America, the mountains are home to Dall sheep, grizzly bears, black bear, gray wolf, moose and porcupine caribou.

In Alaska, the Western Arctic Caribou herd (490,000 strong in 2004) traverses the Brooks Range in its annual migration. The smaller Central Arctic herd (32,000 in 2002), as well as the 123,000 animal Porcupine Caribou herd, likewise migrate through the Brooks range on their annual journeys in and out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The migration path of the Porcupine Caribou herd is the longest of any terrestrial mammal on earth.

==Paleontology==

Because the rocks of the range were formed in an ancient seabed, the Brooks Range contains fossils of marine organisms. In addition to the coral fossils shown, trilobites and brachiopods from the middle Cambrian have been found in the sandy limestones of the Central Brooks Range.

During the middle of the Cretaceous, the Brooks Range thrust belt underwent significant regional extension.

Remains of a woolly mammoth that died about 17,100 years ago were found north of the Brooks Range. A research report on its movement range was published in 2021.

==Climate==
While other Alaskan ranges to the south and closer to the coast can receive to of snow, the average snow precipitation on the Brooks Range is reported at to . Due to a changing climate, between the years 1969–2018 the Eastern and Western portions of the Brooks Range have experienced a 17.2% increase in annual precipitation.

As measured at the Anaktuvuk Pass weather station (elevation ), the average summer temperatures are as a high and as a low. During the winter the average high is while the average low is . Polar amplification is a force experienced in this region as global temperatures are rising. The northern and western regions of Alaska, where the Brooks Range lies, is experiencing a warming rate twice that of southeastern Alaska. The Brooks Range has experienced an increase in average summer temperature between 4.2 °F and 5.8 °F between the years 1969–2018.

In certain areas of the Brooks Range, year round snow cover or &quot;perennial snowfields&quot;, can be found. In 1985, 34 square miles of snowfields were recorded, where as that number has dropped to under four square miles in 2017.

<doc id="219927" wikidata="Q743017" url="?curid=219927" title="American bittern">
<text>The American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) is a species of wading bird in the heron family. It has a Nearctic distribution, breeding in Canada and the northern and central parts of the United States, and wintering in the U.S. Gulf Coast states, all of Florida into the Everglades, the Caribbean islands and parts of Central America.

It is a well-camouflaged, solitary brown bird that unobtrusively inhabits marshes and the coarse vegetation at the edge of lakes and ponds. In the breeding season it is chiefly noticeable by the loud, booming call of the male. The nest is built just above the water, usually among bulrushes and cattails, where the female incubates the clutch of olive-colored eggs for about four weeks. The young leave the nest after two weeks and are fully fledged at six or seven weeks.

The American bittern feeds mostly on fish but also eats other small vertebrates as well as crustaceans and insects. It is fairly common over its wide range, but its numbers are thought to be decreasing, especially in the south, because of habitat degradation. However the total population is large, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot;.

==Description==
The American bittern is a large, chunky, brown bird, very similar to the Eurasian bittern (&quot;Botaurus stellaris&quot;), though slightly smaller, and the plumage is speckled rather than being barred. It is in length, with a wingspan and a body mass of .

The crown is chestnut brown with the centers of the feathers being black. The side of the neck has a bluish-black elongated patch which is larger in the male than in the female. The hind neck is olive, and the mantle and scapulars are dark chestnut-brown, barred and speckled with black, some feathers being edged with buff. The back, rump, and upper tail-coverts are similar in color but more finely speckled with black and with grey bases to the feathers. The tail feathers are chestnut brown with speckled edges, and the primaries and secondaries are blackish-brown with buff or chestnut tips. The cheeks are brown with a buff superciliary stripe and a similarly colored mustachial stripe. The chin is creamy-white with a chestnut central stripe, and the feathers of the throat, breast, and upper belly are buff and rust-colored, finely outlined with black, giving a striped effect to the underparts. The eyes are surrounded by yellowish skin, and the iris is pale yellow. The long, robust bill is yellowish-green, the upper mandible being darker than the lower, and the legs and feet are yellowish-green. Juveniles resemble adults, but the sides of their necks are less olive.

==Taxonomy==
The American bittern was first described in 1813 by the English clergyman Thomas Rackett from a vagrant individual he examined in Dorset, England. No extant subspecies are accepted. However, fossils found in the Ichetucknee River in Florida, and originally described as a new form of heron (&quot;Palaeophoyx columbiana&quot; McCoy, 1963) were later recognized to be a smaller, prehistoric subspecies of the American bittern which lived during the Late Pleistocene (Olson, 1974) and would thus be called &quot;B. l. columbianus&quot;. Its closest living relative is the pinnated bittern (&quot;Botaurus pinnatus&quot;) from Central and South America.

The generic name &quot;Botaurus&quot; was given by English naturalist James Francis Stephens, and is derived from Medieval Latin , &quot;bittern&quot;, constructed from the Middle English name for the Eurasian bittern, . Pliny gave a fanciful derivation from (ox) and (bull), because the bittern&#x27;s call resembles the bellowing of a bull. The species name &quot;lentiginosus&quot; is Latin for &quot;freckled&quot;, from &quot;lentigo&quot; (freckle), and refers to the speckled plumage.

Many folk names are given for its distinctive call. In his book on the common names of American birds, Ernest Choate lists &quot;bog bumper&quot; and &quot;stake driver&quot;. Other vernacular names include &quot;thunder pumper&quot;, &quot;bog bull&quot;, &quot;bog thumper&quot;, &quot;mire drum&quot;, and &quot;water belcher&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Its range includes much of North America. It breeds in southern Canada as far north as British Columbia, the Great Slave Lake and Hudson Bay, and in much of the United States and possibly central Mexico. It migrates southward in the fall and overwinters in the southern United States of the Gulf Coast region, most notably in the marshy Everglades of Florida, the Caribbean Islands and Mexico, with past records also coming from Panama and Costa Rica. As a long-distance migrant, it is a very rare vagrant in Europe, including Great Britain and Ireland. It is an aquatic bird and frequents bogs, marshes and the thickly-vegetated verges of shallow-water lakes and ponds, both with fresh and brackish or saline water. It sometimes feeds out in the open in wet meadows and pastures.

==Behavior==

The American bittern is a solitary bird and usually keeps itself well-hidden and is difficult to observe. It usually hunts by walking stealthily in shallow water and among the vegetation, stalking its prey, but sometimes it stands still in ambush. If it senses that it has been seen, it remains motionless, with its bill pointed upward, its cryptic coloration causing it to blend into the surrounding foliage. It is mainly nocturnal and is most active at dusk. More often heard than seen, the male bittern has a loud, booming call that resembles a congested pump and which has been rendered as &quot;oong, kach, oonk&quot;. While uttering this sound, the bird&#x27;s head is thrown convulsively upward and then forward, and the sound is repeated up to seven times.

The process by which the bittern produces its distinctive sound is not fully understood. It has been suggested that the bird gradually puffs out its neck by inflating its esophagus with air accompanied by a mild clicking or hiccuping sound. The esophagus is kept inflated by means of flaps beside the tongue. Once this action is completed and the esophagus is fully inflated, the distinctive gulping sound is made in the syrinx. When the sound is finished, the bird deflates its esophagus.

Like other members of the heron family, the American bittern feeds in marshes and shallow ponds, preying mainly on fish but also consuming amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, crustaceans and insects. It is a territorial bird and has a threat display which involves slowly erecting long, white, previously-concealed, plumes on its shoulders, to form wing-like extensions that nearly meet across its back, resembling a ruff. The bird then stands still in a threatening posture, or stalks the intruder in a crouching position, with its head retracted and a gliding gait.

This bird nests solitarily in marshes among coarse vegetation such as bulrushes and cattails, with the female building the nest and the male guarding it. The nest is usually about above the water surface and consists of a rough platform of dead stalks and rushes, sometimes with a few twigs mixed in, and lined with bits of coarse grass. Up to about six eggs are laid and are incubated by the female for twenty-nine days. The eggs are bluntly ovoid in shape, olive-buff and unspeckled, averaging in size. The chicks are fed individually, each in turn pulling down the female&#x27;s beak and receiving regurgitated food directly into its beak. They leave the nest at about two weeks and are fully-fledged at six to seven weeks.

==Status==
The bird&#x27;s numbers are declining in many parts of its range because of habitat loss. This is particularly noticeable in the southern part where chemical contamination and human development are reducing the area of suitable habitat. However, the bird has an extremely large range and a large total population, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;. The American bittern is protected under the United States Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. It is also protected under the Canadian Migratory Birds Convention Act of 1994 to which both Canada and the United States are signatories.

<text>Strike Out (1969–1998) was a Standardbred North American Harness racing champion.

==Background==
Strike Out was foaled in 1969 at Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and is by Bret Hanover out of the mare Golden Miss.

He was purchased at a yearling auction for $15,000 by Beejay Stables of Oshawa, Ontario, a partnership between harness-racing trainer/driver John Hayes and Montreal, Quebec, textile executives, the Shapiro brothers, Robert, Conrad, and Leo. For Hayes, who recognized the horse&#x27;s talent, it was an opportunity for which he had been waiting a long time.

==Racing career==
As a two-year-old pacer, Strike Out earned more money than any horse in his age group and was named by Harness Tracks of America (HTA) and the United States Trotting Association (USTA) as the top harness horse his age in North America. In 1972 he became the first horse to win a Canadian harness race with a $100,000 purse. That year he went on to race in the United States, capturing the important Adios Stakes in a dead heat with Jay Time, the Fox Stake, the Roosevelt Futurity, the Beaver Pace and other major races all over North America, including the Prix d&#x27;Été at Montreal&#x27;s Blue Bonnets Raceway. By the end of the summer, his owners had set their sights on the most prestigious race of all, the Little Brown Jug in Delaware, Ohio. Strike Out, was trained by Bruce K. Nickells for two months the previous winter, before he won the Jug with a time of 1:56.3 which set a world record for a three-year-old pacer on a half mile track.

On September 21, 1972, driven by Keith Waples, Strike Out became the first Canadian owned horse to win the Little Brown Jug. Not only did he do it in straight heats, but he won setting a world record over a half-mile track for a 3-year-old pacer in a time of 1:56 3/5. Strike Out was named by the HTA and USTA as top three-year-old.

==Stud career==
After compiling a 29-9-1 record in 44 races, Strike Out was retired to stud at the end of the 1972 season. While retaining a half interest in him, Beejay Stables sold the $15,000 bargain-basement colt for $1.5 million. His son, Striking Image became the first 2 year old Standardbred Horse ever to run a mile in the time of 1:55. Strike Out also went on to sire 1979 Jug winner Hot Hitter.

In 1976 Strike Out was part of the inaugural class inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

Strike Out died on July 4, 1998, and was buried in the horse cemetery at Castleton Farms.

<doc id="219939" wikidata="Q210975" url="?curid=219939" title="Mycoplasma">
<text>Mycoplasma is a genus of bacteria that, like the other members of the class &quot;Mollicutes&quot;, lack a cell wall, and its peptidoglycan, around their cell membrane. The absence of peptidoglycan makes them naturally resistant to antibiotics such as the beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. They can be parasitic or saprotrophic. Several species are pathogenic in humans, including &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;, which is an important cause of &quot;walking&quot; pneumonia and other respiratory disorders, and &quot;M. genitalium&quot;, which is believed to be involved in pelvic inflammatory diseases. &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species (like the other species of the class &quot;Mollicutes&quot;) are among the smallest organisms yet discovered, can survive without oxygen, and come in various shapes. For example, &quot;M. genitalium&quot; is flask-shaped (about 300 x 600 nm), while &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; is more elongated (about 100 x 1000 nm), many &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species are coccoid. Hundreds of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species infect animals.

In casual speech, the name &quot;mycoplasma&quot; (plural &quot;mycoplasmas&quot; or &quot;mycoplasms&quot;) generally refers to all members of the class Mollicutes. In formal scientific classification, the designation &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; refers exclusively to the genus, a member of the Mycoplasmataceae, the only family in the order Mycoplasmatales (see &quot;scientific classification&quot;).
== Etymology ==
The term &quot;mycoplasma&quot;, from the Greek μύκης, &#x27; (fungus) and πλάσμα, &#x27; (formed), was first used by Albert Bernhard Frank in 1889 to describe an altered state of plant cell cytoplasm resulting from infiltration by fungus-like microorganisms. Julian Nowak later proposed the name mycoplasma for certain filamentous microorganisms imagined to have both cellular and acellular stages in their lifecycles, which could explain how they were visible with a microscope, but passed through filters impermeable to other bacteria. Later, the name for these mycoplasmas was pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLO), broadly referring to organisms similar in colonial morphology and filterability to the causative agent (a &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species) of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. At present, all these organisms are classified as Mollicutes, and the term &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; solely refers to the genus.

==Species which infect humans==
Species of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;, other than those listed below, have been recovered from humans, but are assumed to have been contracted from a non-human host. The following species use humans as the primary host:

* &quot;M. amphoriforme&quot;
* &quot;M. buccale&quot;
* &quot;M. faucium&quot;
* &quot;M. fermentans&quot;
* &quot;M. genitalium&quot;
* &quot;M. hominis&quot;
* &quot;M. incognitus&quot;
* &quot;M. lipophilum&quot;
* &quot;M. orale&quot;
* &quot;M. penetrans&quot;
* &quot;M. pirum&quot;
* &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;M. primatum&quot;
* &quot;M. salivarium&quot;
* &quot;M. spermatophilum&quot;


== Characteristics ==
Over 100 species have been included in the genus &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;, a member of the class &quot;Mollicutes.&quot; They are parasites or commensals of humans, animals, and plants. The genus &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; uses vertebrate and arthropod hosts. Dietary nitrogen availability has been shown to alter codon bias and genome evolution in &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and the plant parasites &quot;Phytoplasma&quot;.

&quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species are among the smallest free-living organisms (about 0.2 - 0.3 μm in diameter). They have been found in the pleural cavities of cattle suffering from pleuropneumonia. These organisms are often called MLO (mycoplasma-like organisms) or, formerly, PPLO (pleuropneumonia-like organisms).

===Important characteristics===

# Cell wall is absent and plasma membrane forms the outer boundary of the cell.
# Due to the absence of cell walls these organisms can change their shape and leads to pleomorphism.
# Lack of nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
# Genetic material is a single DNA duplex and is naked.
# Ribosomes are 70S type.
# Possess a replicating disc at one end which assists replication process and also the separation of the genetic materials.
# Heterotrophic nutrition. Some live as saprophytes but the majority are parasites of plants and animals. The parasitic nature is due to the inability of mycoplasmal bacteria to synthesise the required growth factor.

=== Cell and colony morphology ===
Due to the lack of a rigid cell wall, &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species (like all &quot;Mollicutes&quot;) can contort into a broad range of shapes, from round to oblong. They are pleomorphic and therefore cannot be identified as rods, cocci or spirochetes.

Colonies show the typical &quot;fried egg&quot; appearance (about 0.5 mm in diameter).

=== Reproduction ===
In 1954, using phase-contrast microscopy, continual observations of live cells have shown that &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species (&quot;mycoplasmas&quot;, formerly called pleuropneumonia-like organisms, PPLO, now classified as &quot;Mollicutes&quot;) and L-form bacteria (previously also called L-phase bacteria) do not proliferate by binary fission, but by a uni- or multi-polar budding mechanism. Microphotograph series of growing microcultures of different strains of PPLOs, L-form bacteria and, as a control, a Micrococcus species (dividing by binary fission) have been presented.  Additionally, electron microscopic studies have been performed.

== Taxonomy ==

=== History of taxonomy ===
Previously, &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species (often commonly called &quot;mycoplasmas&quot;, now classified as &quot;Mollicutes&quot;) were sometimes considered stable L-form bacteria or even viruses, but phylogenetic analysis has identified them as bacteria that have lost their cell walls in the course of evolution.


The medical and agricultural importance of members of the genus &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and related genera have led to the extensive cataloging of many of these organisms by culture, serology, and small sub-unit rRNA gene and whole-genome sequencing. A recent focus in the sub-discipline of molecular phylogenetics has both clarified and confused certain aspects of the organization of the class &quot;Mollicutes&quot;.

Taxonomists once classified &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and relatives in the phylum Firmicutes, consisting of low G+C Gram-positive bacteria such as &quot;Clostridium&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus&quot;; but modern polyphasic analyses situate them in the phylum Tenericutes.

By the 1990s, it had become readily apparent that this approach was problematic: the type species, &quot;M. mycoides&quot;, along with other significant mycoplasma species like &quot;M. capricolum&quot;, is evolutionarily more closely related to the genus &quot;Spiroplasma&quot; in the order Entomoplasmatales than to the other members of the genus &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;. As a result, if the group was to be rearranged to match phylogeny, a number of medically important species (e.g. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;M. genitalium&quot;) would have to be put in a different genus, causing widespread confusion in medical and agricultural communities. The genus was discussed multiple times by the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology&#x27;s (ICSB) subcommittee on Mollicutes between 1992 and 2011, to no effect.

Regardless of taxonomy, by 2007 it was solidly known that Molicutes could be divided into four nontaxonomic lineages.
* An &quot;Acholeplasma&quot; group consisting of Acholeplasmatales. This group is non-problematic, as it contains no species classified in what was then &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;.
* A &quot;Spiroplasma&quot; or &quot;mycoides&quot; group containing &quot;M. mycoides&quot; and the aforementioned closely-related species in &quot;Spiroplasma&quot; and Entomoplasmatales.
* A &quot;pneumoniae&quot; group containing &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; and closely-related species (&quot;M. muris&quot;, &quot;M. fastidiosum&quot;, &quot;U. urealyticum&quot;), the currently unculturable haemotrophic mollicutes, informally referred to as haemoplasmas (recently transferred from the genera &quot;Haemobartonella&quot; and &quot;Eperythrozoon&quot;), and &quot;Ureaplasma&quot;. This medically important group contains &quot;M. alvi&quot; (bovine), &quot;M. amphoriforme&quot; (human), &quot;M. gallisepticum&quot; (avian), &quot;M. genitalium&quot; (human), &quot;M. imitans&quot; (avian), &quot;M. pirum&quot; (uncertain/human), &quot;M. testudinis&quot; (tortoises), and &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; (human). Most, if not all, of these species share some otherwise unique characteristics including an attachment organelle, homologs of the &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; cytadherence-accessory proteins, and specialized modifications of the cell division apparatus.
* A &quot;hominis&quot; group containing &quot;M. hominis&quot;, &quot;M. bovis&quot;, and &quot;M. pulmonis&quot; among others.

=== As of 2018 ===
In 2018, Gupta et al. re-circumscribed the genus &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; around &quot;M. mycoides&quot;. A total of 78 species were removed from &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;, creating five new genera and a number of higher taxonomic levels. Under this new scheme, a new family Mycoplasmoidaceae was created to correspond to the &quot;pneumoniae&quot; group, with &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; and related species transferred to a new genus &quot;Mycoplasmoides&quot;. Another new family Metamycoplasmataceae was created to correspond to the &quot;hominis&quot; group. Both families belong to a new order Mycoplasmoitales, distinct from the Mycoplasmatales of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;. The taxonomy was accepted by the ICSB with validation list 184 in 2018 and became the correct name. Both List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) now use the new nomenclature.

Gupta&#x27;s proposed taxonomy, as expected, moved the medically important &quot;pneumoniae&quot; group out of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; into its own genus. As a result, a number of mycoplasmologists petitioned to the ICSB to reject the name in 2019. They argue that although Gupta&#x27;s phylogenetic methods were likely solid, the proposed name changes are too sweeping to be practically adopted, citing some principles of the Code such as &quot;name stability&quot;. Gupta and Oren wrote a rebuttal in 2020, further detailing the pre-existing taxonomic problems. In 2022, the ICSP&#x27;s Judicial Opinion 122 ruled in favor of the name changes proposed by Gupta, meaning they remain valid under the Prokaryotic Code (and for the purpose of the LPSN, they remain the &quot;correct names&quot;). However, the older names also remain valid; their use remains acceptable under the Code.

Gupta &quot;et al.&quot; 2019 performed some uncontroversial sorting of the order Mycoplasmatales.

== Laboratory contaminant ==
&quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species are often found in research laboratories as contaminants in cell culture. Mycoplasmal cell culture contamination occurs due to contamination from individuals or contaminated cell culture medium ingredients. &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; cells are physically small – less than 1  μm, so are difficult to detect with a conventional microscope.

Mycoplasmae may induce cellular changes, including chromosome aberrations, changes in metabolism and cell growth. Severe &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; infections may destroy a cell line. Detection techniques include DNA probe, enzyme immunoassays, PCR, plating on sensitive agar and staining with a DNA stain including DAPI or Hoechst.

An estimated 11 to 15% of U.S. laboratory cell cultures are contaminated with mycoplasma.
A Corning study showed that half of U.S. scientists did not test for &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; contamination in their cell cultures. The study also stated that, in former Czechoslovakia, 100% of cell cultures that were not routinely tested were contaminated while only 2% of those routinely tested were contaminated (study p. 6). Since the U.S. contamination rate was based on a study of companies that routinely checked for &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;, the actual contamination rate may be higher. European contamination rates are higher and that of other countries are higher still (up to 80% of Japanese cell cultures).
About 1% of published Gene Expression Omnibus data may have been compromised. Several antibiotic-containing formulations of antimycoplasmal reagents have been developed over the years.

== Synthetic mycoplasma genome ==

A chemically synthesized genome of a mycoplasmal cell based entirely on synthetic DNA which can self-replicate has been referred to as &quot;Mycoplasma laboratorium&quot;. It is therefore a model for a minimal genome, that is, a genome that is reduced to mostly essential genes.

== Pathogenicity ==

Several &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species can cause disease, including &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;, which is an important cause of atypical pneumonia (formerly known as &quot;walking pneumonia&quot;), and &quot;M. genitalium&quot;, which has been associated with pelvic inflammatory diseases. Mycoplasma infections in humans are associated with skin eruptions in 17% of cases.

=== P1 antigen ===

The P1 antigen is the primary virulence factor of mycoplasma, specifically the Pneumoniae group. P1 is a membrane associated protein that allows adhesion to epithelial cells. The P1 receptor is also expressed on erythrocytes which can lead to autoantibody agglutination from mycobacteria infection.

===Sexually transmitted infections===
&quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and &quot;Ureaplasma&quot; species are not part of the normal vaginal flora. Some Mollicutes species are spread through sexual contact. These species have a negative effect on fertility. Mollicutes species colonizing the human genital tract are:
* &quot;U. urealyticum&quot;
* &quot;M. hominis&quot;
* &quot;M. genitalium&quot;
* &quot;M. penetrans&quot;
* &quot;M. primatum&quot; (considered nonpathogenic)
* &quot;M. spermatophilum&quot; (considered nonpathogenic)

&quot;M. hominis&quot; causes &quot;male sterility/Genitals inflammation&quot; in humans.

&quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species have been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis. &quot;M. genitalium&quot; is found in women with pelvic inflammatory disease. In addition, infection is associated with increased risk of cervicitis, infertility, preterm birth and spontaneous abortion. &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; has developed resistance to some antibiotics.
====Infant disease====

Low birth-weight, preterm infants are susceptible to &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and &quot;Ureaplasma&quot; infections. &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species are associated with infant respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants.

=== Links to cancer ===

Several species of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; are frequently detected in different types of cancer cells. These species are:
* &quot;M. fermentans&quot;
* &quot;M. genitalium&quot;
* &quot;M. hyorhinis&quot;
* &quot;M. penetrans&quot;
* &quot;U. urealyticum&quot;

The majority of these &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species have shown a strong correlation to malignant transformation in mammalian cells &quot;in vitro&quot;.

==== infection and host cell transformation ====

The presence of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; was first reported in samples of cancer tissue in the 1960s. Since then, several studies tried to find and prove the connection between &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and cancer, as well as how the bacterium might be involved in the formation of cancer. Several studies have shown that cells that are chronically infected with the bacteria go through a multistep transformation. The changes caused by chronic mycoplasmal infections occur gradually and are both morphological and genetic. The first visual sign of infection is when the cells gradually shift from their normal form to sickle-shaped. They also become hyperchromatic due to an increase of DNA in the nucleus of the cells. In later stages, the cells lose the need for solid support to grow and proliferate, as well as the normal contact-dependent inhibition cells.

==== Possible intracellular mechanisms====

=====Karyotypic changes related to infections=====

Cells infected with &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; for an extended period of time show significant chromosomal abnormalities. These include the addition of chromosomes, the loss of entire chromosomes, partial loss of chromosomes, and chromosomal translocation. All of these genetic abnormalities may contribute to the process of malignant transformation. Chromosomal translocation and extra chromosomes help create abnormally high activity of certain proto-oncogenes, which caused by these genetic abnormalities and include those encoding c-myc, HRAS, and vav. The activity of proto-oncogenes is not the only cellular function that is affected; tumour suppressor genes are affected by the chromosomal changes induced by mycoplasma, as well. Partial or complete loss of chromosomes causes the loss of important genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Two genes whose activities are markedly decreased during chronic infections with mycoplasma are the Rb and the p53 tumour suppressor genes. Another possible mechanism of carcinogenesis is RAC1 activation by a small GTPase-like protein fragment of Mycoplasma. A major feature that differentiates mycoplasmas from other carcinogenic pathogens is that the mycoplasmas do not cause the cellular changes by insertion of their own genetic material into the host cell. The exact mechanism by which the bacterium causes the changes is not yet known.

=====Partial reversibility of malignant transformations=====

The malignant transformation induced by &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species is also different from that caused by other pathogens in that the process is reversible. The state of reversal is, however, only possible up to a certain point during the infection. The window of time when reversibility is possible varies greatly; it depends primarily on the &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; involved. In the case of &quot;M. fermentans&quot;, the transformation is reversible until around week 11 of infection and starts to become irreversible between weeks 11 and 18. If the bacteria are killed using antibiotics (i.e. ciprofloxacin or Clarithromycin) before the irreversible stage, the infected cells should return to normal.

==== Connections to cancer &quot;in vivo&quot; and future research ====

Epidemiologic, genetic, and molecular studies suggest infection and inflammation initiate certain cancers, including those of the prostate. &quot;M. genitalium&quot; and &quot;M. hyorhinis&quot; induce malignant phenotype in benign human prostate cells (BPH-1) that were not tumorigenic after 19 weeks of exposure.
==== Types of cancer associated ====

Colon cancer: In a study to understand the effects of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; contamination on the quality of cultured human colon cancer cells, a positive correlation was found between the number of &quot;M. hyorhinis&quot; cells present in the sample and the percentage of CD133-positive cells (a glycoprotein with an unknown function).

Gastric cancer: Strong evidence indicates the infection of &quot;M. hyorhinis&quot; contributes to the development of cancer within the stomach and increases the likelihood of malignant cancer cell development.

Lung cancer: Studies on lung cancer have supported the belief that more than a coincidental positive correlation exists between the appearance of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; strains in patients and the infection with tumorigenesis.

Prostate cancer: p37, a protein encoded for by &quot;M. hyorhinis&quot;, has been found to promote the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. The protein also causes the growth, morphology, and gene expression of the cells to change, causing them to become a more aggressive phenotype.

Renal cancer: Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) exhibited a significantly high amount of Mycoplasma sp. compared with the healthy control group. This suggests &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; may play a role in the development of RCC.

<text>Vibrio is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria, possessing a curved-rod (comma) shape, several species of which can cause foodborne infection or soft-tissue infection called Vibriosis. Infection is commonly associated with eating undercooked seafood. Being highly salt tolerant and unable to survive in freshwater, &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp. are commonly found in various salt water environments. &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp. are facultative anaerobes that test positive for oxidase and do not form spores. All members of the genus are motile. They are able to have polar or lateral flagellum with or without sheaths. &quot;Vibrio&quot; species typically possess two chromosomes, which is unusual for bacteria. Each chromosome has a distinct and independent origin of replication, and are conserved together over time in the genus. Recent phylogenies have been constructed based on a suite of genes (multilocus sequence analysis).

O. F. Müller (1773, 1786) described eight species of the genus &quot;Vibrio&quot; (included in Infusoria), three of which were spirilliforms. Some of the other species are today assigned to eukaryote taxa, e.g., to the euglenoid &quot;Peranema&quot; or to the diatom &quot;Bacillaria&quot;. However, &quot;Vibrio&quot; Müller, 1773 became regarded as the name of a zoological genus, and the name of the bacterial genus became &quot;Vibrio&quot; Pacini, 1854. Filippo Pacini isolated micro-organisms he called &quot;vibrions&quot; from cholera patients in 1854, because of their motility. In Latin &quot;vibrio&quot; means &quot;to quiver&quot;.

== Biochemical characteristics of &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp. ==
The genus &quot;Vibrio&quot; contains a large number of species, and these vary somewhat in their biochemical characteristics. Colony, morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of the genus &quot;Vibrio&quot; are shown in the Table below.

Note: Group-1: &quot;Vibrio alginolyticus&quot;; Group-2: &quot;Vibrio natriegens, Vibrio pelagius, Vibrio azureus&quot;; + = Positive; – =Negative; V =Variable (+/–)

==Pathogenic strains==

Several species of &quot;Vibrio&quot; are pathogens. Most disease-causing strains are associated with gastroenteritis, but can also infect open wounds and cause sepsis. They can be carried by numerous marine animals, such as crabs or prawns, and have been known to cause fatal infections in humans after exposure. Risk of clinical disease and death increases with certain factors, such as uncontrolled diabetes, elevated iron levels (cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, hemochromatosis), and cancer or other immunocompromised states. Pathogenic &quot;Vibrio&quot; species include &quot;V. cholerae&quot; (the causative agent of cholera), &quot;V. parahaemolyticus&quot;, and &quot;V. vulnificus.&quot; &quot;V. cholerae&quot; is generally transmitted by contaminated water. Pathogenic &quot;Vibrio&quot; species can cause foodborne illness (infection), usually associated with eating undercooked seafood. When ingested &quot;Vibrio&quot; bacteria can primarily result in watery diarrhea along with other secondary symptoms. The pathogenic features can be linked to quorum sensing, where bacteria are able to express their virulence factor via their signaling molecules.

&quot;V. vulnificus&quot; outbreaks commonly occur in warm climates and small, generally lethal, outbreaks occur regularly. An outbreak occurred in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and several lethal cases occur most years in Florida. As of 2013 in the United States, &quot;Vibrio&quot; infections as a whole were up 43% when compared with the rates observed in 2006–2008. &quot;V. vulnificus&quot;, the most severe strain, has not increased. Foodborne &quot;Vibrio&quot; infections are most often associated with eating raw shellfish.

&quot;V. parahaemolyticus&quot; is also associated with the Kanagawa phenomenon, in which strains isolated from human hosts (clinical isolates) are hemolytic on blood agar plates, while those isolated from nonhuman sources are not hemolytic.

Many &quot;Vibrio&quot; species are also zoonotic. They cause disease in fish and shellfish, and are common causes of mortality among domestic marine life.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Cholera ===
A common sign of &quot;Vibrio&quot; infection is cholera. Cholera primarily presents with rapid water loss by watery diarrhea. Other symptoms include vomiting and muscle cramps. Water loss can lead to dehydration which can be mild to moderate to severe. Moderate to severe dehydration requires immediate treatment. &quot;V. cholerae&quot; is the most common pathogen that causes cholera. The gold standard for detecting cholera is through cultures of stool samples or rectal swabs. Identification is then done through microscopy or by agglutination of antibodies. Cultures are done in thiosulfate citrate bile-salts sucrose agar. &quot;V cholerae&quot; will form yellow colonies.

=== Vibriosis ===
Vibriosis is a sign of a more severe &quot;Vibrio&quot; infection. Common causes of vibriosis include consumption of raw or undercooked seafood, primarily oysters, or wound exposure to sea water. The majority of &quot;V. parahaemolyticus&quot; infections can be self-limiting and symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, headaches, fever and chills. &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; can lead to a more serious disease, particularly in wound infection which can turn into necrotizing fasciitis. &quot;V. parahaemolyticu&quot;s is the most common pathogen in vibriosis, however &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; is more common in people who have certain risk factors like older age, liver disease or diabetes mellitus. Like all vibrio diagnosis, vibriosis can also be determined in stool cultures. &quot;V. parahaemolyticus&quot; and &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; will form green colonies.

== Treatment ==

Medical care depends on the clinical presentation and the presence of underlying medical conditions.

=== &quot;Vibrio&quot; gastroenteritis ===
Because &quot;Vibrio&quot; gastroenteritis is self-limited in most patients, no specific medical therapy is required. Patients who cannot tolerate oral fluid replacement may require intravenous fluid therapy.

Although most &quot;Vibrio&quot; species are sensitive to antibiotics, such as doxycycline or ciprofloxacin, antibiotic therapy does not shorten the course of the illness or the duration of pathogen excretion. However, if the patient is ill and has a high fever or an underlying medical condition, oral antibiotic therapy with doxycycline or ciprofloxacin can be initiated.

=== Non-cholera&quot; Vibrio&quot; infections ===
Patients with non-cholera &quot;Vibrio&quot; wound infection or sepsis are much more ill and frequently have other medical conditions. Medical therapy consists of:
* Prompt initiation of effective antibiotic therapy (doxycycline or a quinolone)
* Intensive medical therapy with aggressive fluid replacement and vasopressors for hypotension and septic shock to correct acid-base and electrolytes abnormalities that may be associated with severe sepsis
* Early fasciotomy within 24 hours after development of clinical symptoms can be life-saving in patients with necrotizing fasciitis.
* Early debridement of the infected wound has an important role in successful therapy and is especially indicated to avoid amputation of fingers, toes, or limbs.
* Expeditious and serial surgical evaluation and intervention are required because patients may deteriorate rapidly, especially those with necrotizing fasciitis or compartment syndrome.
* Reconstructive surgery, such as skin grafts, are used in the recovery phase.

== Prevention ==

=== Cholera ===
The most effective method to prevent cholera is the improvement of water and food safety. This includes the sanitation of water, proper preparation of food and community awareness of outbreaks. Prevention has been most effective in countries where cholera is endemic.

Another method is cholera vaccines. Examples of cholera vaccines include Dukoral and Vaxchora.

=== Vibriosis ===
Prevention of vibriosis is mostly effective in food processing. Food items, mostly seafood, that commonly contain &quot;vibrio&quot; organisms are regularly controlled. The water that seafood is fished or farmed from is analyzed to determine microorganism content. Food processing methods like pasteurization and high pressure are used to eliminate microorganisms and pathogens.

== Other strains ==

&quot;V. harveyi&quot; is a pathogen of several aquatic animals, and is notable as a cause of luminous vibriosis in shrimp (prawns). &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot; (or &quot;V. fischeri&quot;) is known for its mutualistic symbiosis with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which is dependent on microbial luminescence.

==Flagella==
The &quot;typical&quot;, early-discovered &quot;Vibrio&quot; species, such as &quot;V. cholerae&quot;, have a single polar flagellum (monotrichous) with sheath. Some species, such as &quot;V. parahaemolyticus&quot; and &quot;V. alginolyticus&quot;, have both a single polar flagellum with sheath and thin flagella projecting in all directions (peritrichous), and the other species, such as &quot;V. fischeri&quot;, have tufts of polar flagella with sheath (lophotrichous).

=== Structure ===
Typical bacterial flagellum structure contains three components: the basal body, the hook and the filament. Like typical bacteria, &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp, have these three components, but with increased complexity in the basal body. In addition, &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp. use five or six distinct flagellum subunits to construct the flagellar filament, rather than the single flagellin found in many other bacteria. In &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp, most have a single flagellum located on one pole of the bacterium, although some species have additional flagella in peritrichous or lophotrichous arrangements. Another difference is that the gradient used to power the flagellar motor is sodium driven rather than proton driven; this creates greater torque, and &quot;Vibrio&quot; flagella have been shown to rotate over five times faster than the -driven flagella of &quot;E. coli&quot;. The flagellum is also surrounded by a sheath extending from the membrane. The purpose of this sheath has yet to be determined.

=== Effect on Virulence ===
Motility is very important for &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp for infection. Research has shown that a variety of &quot;Vibrios&quot; mutants that are defective in flagella synthesis or non-motile are defective in infection. Loss of motility in &quot;Vibrio&quot; has shown impaired colonization and adherence to host&#x27;s intestines.

==Natural transformation==

Natural transformation is a common bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer that employs numerous bacterial gene products. For a recipient bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must become competent, that is, enter a special physiologic state. The DNA-uptake process of naturally competent &quot;V. cholerae&quot; involves an extended competence-induced pilus and a DNA-binding protein that acts as a ratchet and reels DNA into the periplasm. Natural transformation has also been described for &quot;V. fischeri&quot;, &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; and &quot;V. parahaemolyticus&quot;.

== Small RNA ==
&quot;V. cholerae&quot; has been used in discoveries of many bacterial small RNAs. Using sRNA-Seq and Northern blot candidate sRNAs were identified and characterised as IGR-sRNA (intragenic region), AS-sRNAs (transcribed from the antisense strand of the open reading frame (ORF) and ORF-derived. One of the candidates from this study, IGR 7, was shown to be involved in carbon metabolism and later renamed MtlS RNA. Other sRNAs identified in &quot;V. cholerae&quot; through genetic screens and computational methods include Qrr RNA, Vibrio regulatory RNA of OmpA, MiX sRNA, Vibrio cholerae ToxT activated RNAs, foR RNA, and VqmR sRNA.

<doc id="219947" wikidata="Q180114" url="?curid=219947" title="Ayyubid dynasty">
<text>The Ayyubid dynasty (; ), also known as the Ayyubid Sultanate, was the founding dynasty of the medieval Sultanate of Egypt established by Saladin in 1171, following his abolition of the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish origin, Saladin had originally served the Zengid ruler Nur al-Din, leading the latter&#x27;s army against the Crusaders in Fatimid Egypt, where he was made vizier. Following Nur al-Din&#x27;s death, Saladin was proclaimed as the first Sultan of Egypt by the Abbasid Caliphate, and rapidly expanded the new sultanate beyond the Egypt to encompass most of Syria, in addition to Hijaz, Yemen, northern Nubia, Tripolitania and Upper Mesopotamia. Saladin&#x27;s military campaigns set the general borders and sphere of influence of the sultanate of Egypt for the almost 350 years of its existence. Most of the Crusader states fell to Saladin after his victory at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, but the Crusaders reconquered the Syrian coastlands in the 1190s. 

After Saladin&#x27;s death in 1193, his sons contested control of the sultanate, but Saladin&#x27;s brother al-Adil ultimately became sultan in 1200. All of the later Ayyubid sultans of Egypt were his descendants. In the 1230s, the emirs of Syria attempted to assert their independence from Egypt and the Ayyubid realm remained divided until Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored its unity by subduing most of Syria, except Aleppo, by 1247. By then, local Muslim dynasties had driven out the Ayyubids from Yemen, the Hejaz, and parts of Mesopotamia. After his death in 1249, as-Salih Ayyub was succeeded in Egypt by his son al-Mu&#x27;azzam Turanshah. However, the latter was soon overthrown by his Mamluk generals who had repelled a Crusader invasion of the Nile Delta. This effectively ended Ayyubid power in Egypt. Attempts by the emirs of Syria, led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo, to wrest back Egypt failed. In 1260, the Mongols sacked Aleppo and conquered the Ayyubids&#x27; remaining territories soon after. The Mamluks, who expelled the Mongols, maintained the Ayyubid principality of Hama until deposing its last ruler in 1341.

Despite their relatively short tenure, the Ayyubid dynasty had a transformative effect on the region, particularly Egypt. Under the Ayyubids, Egypt, which had previously been a formally Shi&#x27;a caliphate, became the dominant Sunni political and military force, and the economic and cultural centre of the region, a status that it would retain until it was conquered by the Ottomans in 1517. Throughout the sultanate, Ayyubid rule ushered in an era of economic prosperity, and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in the Islamic world. This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim dominance in the region by constructing numerous &quot;madrasas&quot; (Islamic schools of law) in their major cities.

==Name==
In medieval Islamic sources, the Ayyubids were referred to as &quot;Kurdish Regime/Dynasty&quot; ( ), or &quot;the Dynasty/Regime of the Kurds&quot; ( ). They were also referred to as &quot;Ayyubid Kurds&quot; ( ) and &quot;Kurdish rulers of Egypt&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
The progenitor of the Ayyubid dynasty, Najm ad-Din Ayyub ibn Shadhi, belonged to the Kurdish Rawadiya tribe, itself a branch of the large Hadhabani tribe. Ayyub&#x27;s ancestors settled in the town of Dvin, in northern Armenia. The Rawadiya were part of the political-military elite of the town.

Circumstances became unfavorable in Dvin when Turks seized the town. Shadhi left with his two sons Ayyub and Asad ad-Din Shirkuh. His friend Mujahid ad-Din Bihruz—the military governor of northern Mesopotamia under the Seljuks—welcomed him and appointed him governor of Tikrit. After Shadhi&#x27;s death, Ayyub succeeded him in governance of the city with the assistance of his brother Shirkuh. Together they managed the affairs of the city well, gaining them popularity from the local inhabitants. In the meantime, Imad ad-Din Zangi, the ruler of Mosul, was defeated by the Abbasids under Caliph al-Mustarshid and Bihruz. In his bid to escape the battlefield to Mosul via Tikrit, Zangi took shelter with Ayyub and sought his assistance in this task. Ayyub complied and provided Zangi and his companions boats to cross the Tigris River and safely reach Mosul.

As a consequence for assisting Zangi, the Abbasid authorities sought punitive measures against Ayyub. Simultaneously, in a separate incident, Shirkuh killed a close confidant of Bihruz on charges that he had sexually assaulted a woman in Tikrit. The Abbasid court issued arrest warrants for both Ayyub and Shirkuh, but before the brothers could be arrested, they departed Tikrit for Mosul in 1138. When they arrived in Mosul, Zangi provided them with all the facilities they needed and he recruited the two brothers into his service. Ayyub was made commander of Ba&#x27;albek and Shirkuh entered the service of Zangi&#x27;s son, Nur ad-Din. According to historian Abdul Ali, it was under the care and patronage of Zangi that the Ayyubid family rose to prominence.

===Establishment in Egypt===
In 1164, Nur al-Din dispatched Shirkuh to lead an expeditionary force to prevent the Crusaders from establishing a strong presence in an increasingly anarchic Egypt. Shirkuh enlisted Ayyub&#x27;s son, Saladin, as an officer under his command. They successfully drove out Dirgham, the vizier of Egypt, and reinstated his predecessor Shawar. After being reinstated, Shawar ordered Shirkuh to withdraw his forces from Egypt, but Shirkuh refused, claiming it was Nur al-Din&#x27;s will that he remain. Over the course of several years, Shirkuh and Saladin defeated the combined forces of the Crusaders and Shawar&#x27;s troops, first at Bilbais, then at a site near Giza, and in Alexandria, where Saladin would stay to protect while Shirkuh pursued Crusader forces in Lower Egypt.

Shawar died in 1169 and Shirkuh became vizier, but he too died later that year. After Shirkuh&#x27;s death, Saladin was appointed vizier by the Fatimid caliph al-Adid because there was &quot;no one weaker or younger&quot; than Saladin, and &quot;not one of the emirs obeyed him or served him&quot;, according to medieval Muslim chronicler Ibn al-Athir. Saladin soon found himself more independent than ever before in his career, much to the dismay of Nur al-Din who attempted to influence events in Egypt. He permitted Saladin&#x27;s elder brother, Turan-Shah, to supervise Saladin in a bid to cause dissension within the Ayyubid family and thus undermining its position in Egypt. Nur al-Din satisfied Saladin&#x27;s request that he be joined by his father Ayyub. However, Ayyub was sent primarily to ensure that Abbasid suzerainty was proclaimed in Egypt, which Saladin was reluctant to undertake due to his position as the vizier of the Fatimids. Although Nur al-Din failed to provoke the Ayyubids into rivalry, the extended Ayyubid family, particularly a number of local governors in Syria, did not entirely back Saladin.
Saladin consolidated his control in Egypt after ordering Turan-Shah to put down a revolt in Cairo staged by the Fatimid army&#x27;s 50,000-strong Nubian regiments. After this success, Saladin began granting his family members high-ranking positions in the country and increased Sunni Muslim influence in Shia Muslim-dominated Cairo by ordering the construction of a college for the Maliki school of jurisprudence of Sunni Islam in the city, and another for the Shafi&#x27;i school, to which he belonged, in al-Fustat. In 1171, al-Adid died and Saladin took advantage of this power vacuum, effectively taking control of the country. Upon seizing power, he switched Egypt&#x27;s allegiance to the Baghdad-based Abbasid Caliphate which adhered to Sunni Islam.

===Expansion===
====Conquest of North Africa and Nubia====
Saladin went to Alexandria in 1171–72 and found himself facing the dilemma of having many supporters in the city, but little money. A family council was held there by the Ayyubid emirs of Egypt where it was decided that al-Muzaffar Taqi al-Din Umar, Saladin&#x27;s nephew, would launch an expedition against the coastal region of Barqa (Cyrenaica) west of Egypt with a force of 500 cavalry. In order to justify the raid, a letter was sent to the Bedouin tribes of Barqa, rebuking them for their robberies of travelers and ordering them to pay the alms-tax (&quot;zakat&quot;). The latter was to be collected from their livestock.

In late 1172, Aswan was besieged by former Fatimid soldiers from Nubia and the governor of the city, Kanz al-Dawla—a former Fatimid loyalist—requested reinforcements from Saladin who complied. The reinforcements had come after the Nubians had already departed Aswan, but Ayyubid forces led by Turan-Shah advanced and conquered northern Nubia after capturing the town of Ibrim. Turan-Shah and his Kurdish soldiers temporarily lodged there. From Ibrim, they raided the surrounding region, halting their operations after being presented with an armistice proposal from the Makurian king. Although Turan-Shah&#x27;s initial response was hawkish, he later sent an envoy to Dongola, who upon returning, described the poverty of the city and of Nubia in general to Turan-Shah. Consequently, the Ayyubids, like their Fatimid predecessors, were discouraged from further southward expansion into Nubia due to the poverty of the region, but required Nubia to guarantee the protection of Aswan and Upper Egypt. The Ayyubid garrison in Ibrim withdrew to Egypt in 1175.

Throughout the 1170s, the Ayyubids continued to push west as well. Sharaf al-Din Qaraqush, a commander under al-Muzaffar Taqi al-Din Umar, led most of these expeditions on the frontier. He captured Siwa in 1172 and conquered Cyrenaica before 1174. He subsequently conquered Tripoli with an army of Turks and Kurds, joined by Arab troops from some of the region&#x27;s Bedouin tribes. The exact date of Tripoli&#x27;s capture is uncertain, but happened sometime in the 1170s or early 1180s. While some Ayyubid forces fought the Crusaders in the Levant, Qaraqush&#x27;s forces went on to capture most of Ifriqiya (present-day Tunisia) from the Almohads by 1185–1186. By this point, Qaraqush had also entered into alliance with the Banu Ghaniya, led by Ali ibn Ghaniya, another enemy of the Almohads. The Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur reconquered Ifriqiya from 1187 to 1188, defeating both of them. The Ayyubids made no further attempts to intervene in the Maghreb after this.

====Conquest of Arabia====

In 1173, Saladin sent Turan-Shah to conquer Yemen and the Hejaz. Muslim writers Ibn al-Athir and later al-Maqrizi wrote that the reasoning behind the conquest of Yemen was an Ayyubid fear that should Egypt fall to Nur al-Din, they could seek refuge in a faraway territory. In May 1174, Turan-Shah conquered Zabid and later that year captured Aden. Aden became the principal maritime port of the dynasty in the Indian Ocean and the principal city of Yemen, although the official capital of Ayyubid Yemen was Ta&#x27;iz. The advent of the Ayyubids marked the beginning of a period of renewed prosperity in the city which saw the improvement of its commercial infrastructure, the establishment of new institutions, and the minting of its own coins. Following this prosperity, the Ayyubids implemented a new tax which was collected by galleys.

Turan-Shah drove out the remaining Hamdanid rulers of Sana&#x27;a, conquering the mountainous city in 1175. With the conquest of Yemen, the Ayyubids developed a coastal fleet, &quot;al-asakir al-bahriyya&quot;, which they used to guard the sea coasts under their control and protect them from pirate raids. The conquest held great significance for Yemen because the Ayyubids managed to unite the previous three independent states (Zabid, Aden, and Sana&#x27;a) under a single power. However, when Turan-Shah was transferred from his governorship in Yemen in 1176, uprisings broke out in the territory and were not quelled until 1182 when Saladin assigned his other brother Tughtekin Sayf al-Islam as governor of Yemen. The Ayyubid &quot;na&#x27;ib&quot; (deputy governor) of Yemen, Uthman al-Zandjili, conquered the greater part of Hadramaut in 1180, upon Turan-Shah&#x27;s return to Yemen.

From Yemen, as from Egypt, the Ayyubids aimed to dominate the Red Sea trade routes which Egypt depended on and so sought to tighten their grip over the Hejaz, where an important trade stop, Yanbu, was located. To favor trade in the direction of the Red Sea, the Ayyubids built facilities along the Red Sea-Indian Ocean trade routes to accompany merchants. The Ayyubids also aspired to back their claims of legitimacy within the Caliphate by having sovereignty over the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The conquests and economic advancements undertaken by Saladin effectively established Egypt&#x27;s hegemony in the region.

====Conquest of Syria and Upper Mesopotamia====
Although still nominally a vassal of Nur al-Din, Saladin adopted an increasingly independent foreign policy. This independence became more publicly pronounced after Nur al-Din&#x27;s death in 1174. Thereafter, Saladin set out to conquer Syria from the Zengids; and on November 23 he was welcomed in Damascus by the governor of the city. By 1175, he had taken control of Hama and Homs but failed to take Aleppo after besieging it. Control of Homs was handed to the descendants of Shirkuh in 1179 and Hama was given to Saladin&#x27;s nephew, al-Muzaffar Umar. Saladin&#x27;s successes alarmed Emir Saif al-Din of Mosul, the head of the Zengids at the time, who regarded Syria as his family&#x27;s estate and was angered that it was being usurped by a former servant of Nur al-Din. He mustered an army to confront Saladin near Hama. Although heavily outnumbered, Saladin and his veteran soldiers decisively defeated the Zengids. After his victory, Saladin proclaimed himself king and suppressed the name of as-Salih Ismail al-Malik (Nur al-Din&#x27;s adolescent son) in Friday prayers and Islamic coinage, replacing it with his own name. The Abbasid caliph, al-Mustadi, graciously welcomed Saladin&#x27;s assumption of power and gave him the title of &quot;Sultan of Egypt and Syria&quot;.

In the spring of 1176, another major confrontation occurred between the Zengids and the Ayyubids, this time at the Sultan&#x27;s Mound, from Aleppo. Saladin again emerged victorious, but Saif al-Din managed to narrowly escape. The Ayyubids proceeded to conquer other Syrian cities in the north, namely Ma&#x27;arat al-Numan, A&#x27;zaz, Buza&#x27;a, and Manbij, but failed to capture Aleppo during a second siege. An agreement was laid out, however, whereby Gumushtigin, the governor of Aleppo, and his allies at Hisn Kayfa and Mardin, would recognize Saladin as the sovereign of the Ayyubids&#x27; possessions in Syria, while Saladin allowed for Gumushtigin and as-Salih al-Malik to continue their rule over Aleppo.
While Saladin was in Syria, his brother al-Adil governed Egypt, and in 1174–75, Kanz al-Dawla of Aswan revolted against the Ayyubids with the intention of restoring Fatimid rule. His main backers were the local Bedouin tribes and the Nubians, but he also enjoyed the support of a multitude of other groups, including the Armenians. Coincidental or possibly in coordination, was an uprising by Abbas ibn Shadi who overran Qus along the Nile River in central Egypt. Both rebellions were crushed by al-Adil. For the rest of that year and throughout early 1176, Qaraqush continued his raids in western North Africa, bringing the Ayyubids into conflict with the Almohads who ruled the Maghreb.

In 1177, Saladin led a force of some 26,000 soldiers, according to Crusader chronicler William of Tyre, into southern Palestine after hearing that most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem&#x27;s soldiers were besieging Harem, Syria west of Aleppo. Suddenly attacked by the Templars under Baldwin IV of Jerusalem near Ramla, the Ayyubid army was defeated at the Battle of Montgisard, with the majority of its troops killed. Saladin encamped at Homs the following year and a number of skirmishes between his forces, commanded by Farrukh Shah, and the Crusaders occurred. Undeterred, Saladin invaded the Crusader states from the west and defeated Baldwin at the Battle of Marj Ayyun in 1179. The following year, he destroyed the newly built Crusader castle of Chastellet at the Battle of Jacob&#x27;s Ford. In the campaign of 1182, he sparred with Baldwin again in the inconclusive Battle of Belvoir Castle in Kawkab al-Hawa.

In May 1182, Saladin captured Aleppo after a brief siege; the new governor of the city, Imad al-Din Zangi II, had been unpopular with his subjects and surrendered Aleppo after Saladin agreed to restore Zangi II&#x27;s previous control over Sinjar, Raqqa, and Nusaybin, which would thereafter serve as vassal territories of the Ayyubids. Aleppo formally entered Ayyubid hands on 12 June. The day after, Saladin marched to Harim, near the Crusader-held Antioch and captured the city when its garrison forced out their leader, Surhak, who was then briefly detained and released by al-Muzaffar Umar. The surrender of Aleppo and Saladin&#x27;s allegiance with Zangi II had left Izz al-Din al-Mas&#x27;ud of Mosul the only major Muslim rival of the Ayyubids. Mosul had been subjected to a short siege in the autumn of 1182, but after mediation by the Abbasid caliph an-Nasir, Saladin withdrew his forces. Mas&#x27;ud attempted to align himself with the Artuqids of Mardin, but they became allies of Saladin instead. In 1183, Irbil too switched allegiance to the Ayyubids. Mas&#x27;ud then sought the support of Pahlawan ibn Muhammad, the governor of Azerbaijan, and although he did not usually intervene in the region, the possibility of Pahlawan&#x27;s intervention made Saladin cautious about launching further attacks against Mosul.

An arrangement was negotiated whereby al-Adil was to administer Aleppo in the name of Saladin&#x27;s son al-Afdal, while Egypt would be governed by al-Muzaffar Umar in the name of Saladin&#x27;s other son Uthman. When the two sons were to come of age they would assume power in the two territories, but if any died, one of Saladin&#x27;s brothers would take their place. In the summer of 1183, after ravaging eastern Galilee, Saladin&#x27;s raids there culminated in the Battle of al-Fule in the Jezreel Valley between him and the Crusaders under Guy of Lusignan. The mostly hand-to-hand fighting ended indecisively. The two armies withdrew to a mile from each other and while the Crusaders discussed internal matters, Saladin captured the Golan Plateau, cutting the Crusaders off from their main supplies source. In October 1183 and then on 13 August 1184, Saladin and al-Adil besieged Crusader-held Karak, but were unable to capture it. Afterward, the Ayyubids raided Samaria, burning down Nablus. Saladin returned to Damascus in September 1184 and a relative peace between the Crusader states and the Ayyubid empire subsequently ensued in 1184–1185.

Saladin launched his last offensive against Mosul in late 1185, hoping for an easy victory over a presumably demoralized Mas&#x27;ud, but failed due to the city&#x27;s unexpectedly stiff resistance and a serious illness which caused Saladin to withdraw to Harran. Upon Abbasid encouragement, Saladin and Mas&#x27;ud negotiated a treaty in March 1186 that left the Zengids in control of Mosul, but had to cede the eastern region beyond lesser Zab to Shahrizor to direct Ayyubid control, and under the obligation to supply the Ayyubids with military support when requested.

====Conquest of Palestine and Transjordan====
Saladin besieged Tiberias in the eastern Galilee on 3 July 1187 and the Crusader army attempted to attack the Ayyubids by way of Kafr Kanna. After hearing of the Crusaders&#x27; march, Saladin led his guard back to their main camp at Kafr Sabt, leaving a small detachment at Tiberias. With a clear view of the Crusader army, Saladin ordered al-Muzaffar Umar to block the Crusaders&#x27; entry from Hattin by taking a position near Lubya, while Gökböri and his troops were stationed at a hill near al-Shajara. On 4 July the Crusaders advanced toward the Horns of Hattin and charged against the Muslim forces, but were overwhelmed and defeated decisively. Four days after the battle, Saladin invited al-Adil to join him in the reconquest of Palestine, Galilee and Lebanese coast. On 8 July the Crusader stronghold of Acre was captured by Saladin, while his forces seized Nazareth and Saffuriya; other brigades took Haifa, Caesarea, Sebastia and Nablus, while al-Adil conquered Mirabel and Jaffa. On 26 July, Saladin returned to the coast and received the surrender of Sarepta, Sidon, Beirut, and Jableh. In August, the Ayyubids conquered Ramla, Darum, Gaza, Bayt Jibrin, and Latrun. Ascalon was taken on 4 September. In September–October 1187, the Ayyubids besieged Jerusalem, taking possession of it on 2 October, after negotiations with Balian of Ibelin.

Karak and Mont Real in Transjordan soon fell, followed by Safad in the northeastern Galilee. By the end of 1187 the Ayyubids were in control of virtually the entire Crusader kingdom in the Levant with the exception of Tyre, which held out under Conrad of Montferrat. In December 1187, an Ayyubid army consisting of the garrisons of Saladin and his brothers from Aleppo, Hama, and Egypt besieged Tyre. Half of the Muslim naval fleet was seized by Conrad&#x27;s forces on 29 December, followed by an Ayyubid defeat on the shoreline of the city. On 1 January 1188, Saladin held a war council where a withdrawal from Tripoli was agreed.

====Third Crusade====
Pope Gregory VIII called for a Third Crusade against the Muslims in early 1189. Frederick Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire, Philip Augustus of France, and Richard the Lionheart of England formed an alliance to reconquer Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the Crusaders and the Ayyubids fought near Acre that year and were joined by the reinforcements from Europe. From 1189 to 1191, Acre was besieged by the Crusaders, and despite initial Muslim successes, it fell to Crusader forces. A massacre of 2,700 Muslim prisoners of war ensued, and the Crusaders then made plans to take Ascalon in the south.

As the Ayyubids faced a Crusader naval blockade in Acre and a steady flow of Crusader reinforcements arriving by sea, Saladin sought assistance from the Almohads, who had one of the largest navies in the Mediterranean. In 1189–1190, he sent letters to Yaqub al-Mansur requesting naval support in Palestine, which the Almohad caliph declined. Various explanations for this refusal have been suggest by historians, including the Almohads&#x27; focus on al-Andalus, ideological differences between the two Muslim states, and the distrust caused by Qaraqush&#x27;s invasion of Ifriqiya.

The Crusaders, now under the unified command of Richard, defeated Saladin at the Battle of Arsuf, allowing for the Crusader conquest of Jaffa and much of coastal Palestine, but they were unable to recover the interior regions. Instead, Richard signed a treaty with Saladin in 1192, restoring the Kingdom of Jerusalem to a coastal strip between Jaffa and Beirut. It was the last major war effort of Saladin&#x27;s career, as he died the next year, in 1193.

===Quarrels over the sultanate===

Rather than establishing a centralized empire, Saladin had established hereditary ownership throughout his lands, dividing his empire among his kinsmen, with family members presiding over semi-autonomous fiefs and principalities. Although these princes (&quot;emirs&quot;) owed allegiance to the Ayyubid sultan, they maintained relative independence in their own territories. Upon Saladin&#x27;s death, az-Zahir took Aleppo from al-Adil per the arrangement and al-Aziz Uthman held Cairo, while his eldest son, al-Afdal retained Damascus, which also included Palestine and much of Mount Lebanon. Al-Adil then acquired al-Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), where he held the Zengids of Mosul at bay. In 1193, Mas&#x27;ud of Mosul joined forces with Zangi II of Sinjar and together the Zengid coalition moved to conquer al-Jazira. However, before any major results could be achieved, Mas&#x27;ud fell ill and returned to Mosul, and al-Adil then compelled Zangi to make a quick peace before the Zengids suffered territorial losses at the hands of the Ayyubids. Al-Adil&#x27;s son al-Mu&#x27;azzam took possession of Karak and Transjordan.

Soon, however, Saladin&#x27;s sons squabbled over the division of the empire. Saladin had appointed al-Afdal to the governorship of Damascus with the intention that his son should continue to see the city as his principal place of residence in order to emphasize the primacy of the &quot;jihad&quot; (struggle) against the Crusader states. Al-Afdal, however, found that his attachment to Damascus contributed to his undoing. Several of his father&#x27;s subordinate &quot;emirs&quot; left the city for Cairo to lobby Uthman to oust him on claims he was inexperienced and intended to oust the Ayyubid old guard. Al-Adil further encouraged Uthman to act in order prevent al-Afdal&#x27;s incompetence putting the Ayyubid empire in jeopardy. Thus, in 1194, Uthman openly demanded the sultanate. Uthman&#x27;s claim to the throne was settled in a series of assaults on Damascus in 1196, forcing al-Afdal to leave for a lesser post at Salkhad. Al-Adil established himself in Damascus as a lieutenant of Uthman, but wielded great influence within the empire.
When Uthman died in a hunting accident near Cairo, al-Afdal was again made sultan (although Uthman&#x27;s son al-Mansur was the nominal ruler of Egypt), al-Adil having been absent in a campaign in the northeast. Al-Adil returned and managed to occupy the Citadel of Damascus, but then faced a strong assault from the combined forces of al-Afdal and his brother az-Zahir of Aleppo. These forces disintegrated under al-Afdal&#x27;s leadership and in 1200, al-Adil resumed his offensive. Upon Uthman&#x27;s death, two clans of &quot;mamluks&quot; (slave soldiers) entered into conflict. They were the Asadiyya and Salahiyya, both of which Shirkuh and Saladin had purchased. The Salahiyya backed al-Adil in his struggles against al-Afdal. With their support, al-Adil conquered Cairo in 1200, and forced al-Afdal to accept internal banishment. He proclaimed himself Sultan of Egypt and Syria afterward and entrusted the governance of Damascus to al-Mu&#x27;azzam and al-Jazira to his other son al-Kamil. Also around 1200, a &quot;sharif&quot; (tribal head related to the Islamic prophet Muhammad), Qatada ibn Idris, seized power in Mecca and was recognized as the &quot;emir&quot; of the city by al-Adil.

Al-Afdal attempted unsuccessfully to take Damascus his final time. Al-Adil entered the city in triumph in 1201. Thereafter, al-Adil&#x27;s line, rather than Saladin&#x27;s line, dominated the next 50 years of Ayyubid rule. However, az-Zahir still held Aleppo and al-Afdal was given Samosata in Anatolia. Al-Adil redistributed his possessions between his sons: al-Kamil was to succeed him in Egypt, al-Ashraf received al-Jazira, and al-Awhad was given Diyar Bakr, but the latter territory shifted to al-Ashraf&#x27;s domain after al-Awhad died.

Al-Adil aroused open hostility from the Hanbali lobby in Damascus for largely ignoring the Crusaders, having launched only one campaign against them. Al-Adil believed that the Crusader army could not be defeated in a direct fight. Prolonged campaigns also involved the difficulties of maintaining a coherent Muslim coalition. The trend under al-Adil was the steady growth of the empire, mainly through the expansion of Ayyubid authority in al-Jazira and incorporation of Shah-Armen domains (in eastern Anatolia). The Abbasids eventually recognized al-Adil&#x27;s role as sultan in 1207.

By 1208 Kingdom of Georgia challenged Ayyubid rule in eastern Anatolia and besieged Khilat (possessions of al-Awhad). In response al-Adil assembled and personally led large Muslim army that included the emirs of Homs, Hama and Baalbek as well as contingents from other Ayyubid principalities to support al-Awhad. During the siege, Georgian general Ivane Mkhargrdzeli accidentally fell into the hands of the al-Awhad on the outskirts of Khilat and was released in 1210, only after the Georgians agreed to sign a Thirty Years&#x27; Truce. The truce ended the Georgian menace to Ayyubid Armenia, leaving the Lake Van region to the Ayyubids of Damascus.

A Crusader military campaign was launched on 3 November 1217, beginning with an offensive towards Transjordan. Al-Mu&#x27;azzam urged al-Adil to launch a counter-attack, but he rejected his son&#x27;s proposal. In 1218, the fortress of Damietta in the Nile Delta was besieged by the Crusaders. After two failed attempts, the fortress eventually capitulated on 25 August. Six days later al-Adil died of apparent shock at Damietta&#x27;s loss.

Al-Kamil proclaimed himself sultan in Cairo, while his brother al-Mu&#x27;azzam claimed the throne in Damascus. Al-Kamil attempted to retake Damietta, but was forced back by John of Brienne. After learning of a conspiracy against him, he fled, leaving the Egyptian army leaderless. Panic ensued, but with the help of al-Mu&#x27;azzam, al-Kamil regrouped his forces. By then, however, the Crusaders had seized his camp. The Ayyubids offered to negotiate for a withdrawal from Damietta, offering the restoration of Palestine to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, with the exception of the forts of Mont Real and Karak. This was refused by the leader of the Fifth Crusade, Pelagius of Albano, and in 1221, the Crusaders were driven out of the Nile Delta after the Ayyubid victory at Mansura.

===Disintegration===
====Loss of territories and ceding of Jerusalem====

In the east, the Khwarezemids under Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu captured the town of Khilat from al-Ashraf, while the traditionally loyalist Rasulids began to encroach on Ayyubid holdings in Arabia. In 1222 the Ayyubids appointed the Rasulid leader Ali ibn Rasul as governor of Mecca. Ayyubid rule in Yemen and the Hejaz was declining and the Ayyubid governor of Yemen, Mas&#x27;ud ibn Kamil, was forced to leave for Egypt in 1223. He appointed Nur ad-Din Umar as his deputy governor while he was absent. In 1224 a local dynasty gained control of Hadramaut from the Ayyubids, whose control of it had been weakened due to their troubled situation in Yemen proper. Following Mas&#x27;ud ibn Kamil&#x27;s death in 1229, Nur ad-Din Umar declared his independence and discontinued the annual tribute payment to the Ayyubids in Egypt.

Under Frederick II, a Sixth Crusade was launched, capitalizing on the ongoing strife between al-Kamil of Egypt and al-Mu&#x27;azzam of Syria. Subsequently, al-Kamil offered Jerusalem to Frederick to help prevent a Syrian invasion of Egypt, but Frederick refused. Al-Kamil&#x27;s position was strengthened when al-Mu&#x27;azzam died in 1227 and was succeeded by his son an-Nasir Dawud. Al-Kamil continued negotiations with Frederick in Acre in 1228, leading to a truce signed in February 1229. The agreement gave the Crusaders control over an unfortified Jerusalem for over ten years, but also guaranteed Muslim control over Islamic holy places in the city. Although the treaty held little military significance, an-Nasir Dawud used it as a pretext to provoke the sentiments of Syria&#x27;s inhabitants. A Friday sermon by a popular preacher at the Umayyad Mosque &quot;reduced the crowd to violent sobbing and tears&quot;.

The settlement with the Crusaders was accompanied by a proposed redistribution of the Ayyubid principalities whereby Damascus and its territories would by governed by al-Ashraf, who recognized al-Kamil&#x27;s sovereignty. An-Nasir Dawud resisted, incensed by the Ayyubid-Crusader truce. Al-Kamil&#x27;s forces reached Damascus to enforce the proposed agreement in May 1229. The ensuing siege levied significant pressure on the inhabitants, but they rallied to an-Nasir Dawud, having been supportive of his father&#x27;s stable rule and angered at the treaty with Frederick. After one month, an-Nasir Dawud sued for peace and was granted a new principality, centered around Karak, while al-Ashraf, the governor of Diyar Bakr, assumed the governorship of Damascus.

Meanwhile, the Seljuks were advancing towards al-Jazira. The descendants of Qatada ibn Idris challenged Ayyubid rule in Mecca. The Rasulids took advantage of this to end Ayyubid suzerainty in the Hejaz and bring the region under their control, which they accomplished in 1238 when Nur al-Din Umar captured Mecca.

====Syro-Egyptian divide====

Al-Ashraf&#x27;s rule in Damascus was stable, but he and the other &quot;emirs&quot; of Syria sought to assert their independence from Cairo. Amid these tensions, al-Ashraf died in August 1237 after a four-month illness and was succeeded by his brother as-Salih Ismail. Two months later, al-Kamil&#x27;s Egyptian army arrived and besieged Damascus, but as-Salih Ismail had destroyed the suburbs of the city to deny al-Kamil&#x27;s forces shelter. In 1232, al-Kamil installed his eldest son as-Salih Ayyub to govern Hisn Kayfa, but upon al-Kamil&#x27;s death in 1238, as-Salih Ayyub disputed the proclamation of younger brother al-Adil II as sultan in Cairo. As-Salih Ayyub eventually occupied Damascus in December 1238, but his uncle Ismail retrieved the city in September 1239. Ismail&#x27;s cousin an-Nasir Dawud had Ismail detained in Karak in a move to prevent the latter&#x27;s arrest by al-Adil II. Ismail entered into an alliance with Dawud who released him the following year, allowing him to proclaim himself sultan in place of al-Adil II in May 1240.

Throughout the early 1240s, as-Salih Ayyub carried out reprisals against those who supported al-Adil II, and he then quarreled with an-Nasir Dawud who had reconciled with as-Salih Ismail of Damascus. The rival sultans as-Salih Ayyub and Ismail attempted to ally with the Crusaders against the other. In 1244, the breakaway Ayyubids of Syria allied with the Crusaders and confronted the coalition of as-Salih Ayyub and the Khwarizmids at Hirbiya, near Gaza. A large battle ensued, resulting in a major victory for as-Salih Ayyub and the virtual collapse of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

====Restoration of unity====
In 1244–1245, as-Salih Ayyub had seized the area approximate to the modern-day West Bank from an-Nasir Dawud; he gained possession of Jerusalem, then marched on to take Damascus, which fell with relative ease in October 1245. Shortly afterward, Sayf al-Din Ali surrendered his exposed principality of Ajlun and its fortress to as-Salih Ayyub. The rupture of the alliance between the Khwarizmids and as-Salih Ayyub ended with the virtual destruction of the former by al-Mansur Ibrahim, the Ayyubid &quot;emir&quot; of Homs, in October 1246. With the Khwarizimid defeat, as-Salih Ayyub was able to complete the conquest of southern Syria. His general Fakhr ad-Din went on to subdue an-Nasir Dawud&#x27;s territories. He sacked the lower town of Karak, then besieged its fortress. A stalemate followed with neither an-Nasir Dawud or Fakhr ad-Din strong enough to dislodge the other&#x27;s forces. A settlement was eventually reached whereby an-Nasir Dawud would retain the fortress, but cede the remainder of his principality to as-Salih Ayyub. Having settled the situation in Palestine and Transjordan, Fakhr ad-Din moved north and marched to Bosra, the last place still held by Ismail. During the siege, Fakhr ad-Din fell ill, but his commanders continued the assault against the city, which fell in December 1246.

By May 1247, as-Salih Ayyub was master of Syria south of Lake Homs, having gained control over Banyas and Salkhad. With his fellow Ayyubid opponents subdued, except for Aleppo under an-Nasir Yusuf, as-Salih Ayyub undertook a limited offensive against the Crusaders, sending Fakhr ad-Din to move against their territories in the Galilee. Tiberias fell on 16 June, followed by Mount Tabor and Kawkab al-Hawa soon thereafter. Safad with its Templar fortress seemed out of reach, so the Ayyubids marched south to Ascalon. Facing stubborn resistance from the Crusader garrison, an Egyptian flotilla was sent by as-Salih Ayyub to support the siege and on 24 October, Fakhr ad-Din&#x27;s troops stormed through a breach in the walls and killed or captured the entire garrison. The city was razed and left deserted.

As-Salih Ayyub returned to Damascus to keep an eye on developments in northern Syria. Al-Ashraf Musa of Homs had ceded the important stronghold of Salamiyah to as-Salih Ayyub the previous winter, perhaps to underline their patron-client relationship. This troubled the Ayyubids of Aleppo who feared it would be used as a base for a military take-over of their city. An-Nasir Yusuf found this intolerable and decided to annex Homs in the winter of 1248. The city surrendered in August and an-Nasir Yusuf&#x27;s terms forced al-Ashraf Musa to hand over Homs, but he was allowed to retain nearby Palmyra and Tell Bashir in the Syrian Desert. As-Salih Ayyub sent Fakhr ad-Din to recapture Homs, but Aleppo countered by sending an army to Kafr Tab, south of the city. An-Nasir Dawud left Karak for Aleppo to support an-Nasir Yusuf, but in his absence, his brothers al-Amjad Hasan and az-Zahir Shadhi detained his heir al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa and then personally went to as-Salih Ayyub&#x27;s camp at al-Mansourah in Egypt to offer him control of Karak in return for holdings in Egypt. As-Salih Ayyub agreed and sent the eunuch Badr al-Din Sawabi to act as his governor in Karak.

===Fall===
====Rise of the Mamluks and fall of Egypt====
In 1248, a Crusader fleet of 1,800 boats and ships arrived in Cyprus with the intent of launching a Seventh Crusade against the Muslims by conquering Egypt. Their commander, Louis IX, attempted to enlist the Mongols to launch a coordinated attack on Egypt, but when this failed to materialize, the Crusader force sailed to Damietta and the local population there fled as soon as they landed. When as-Salih Ayyub, who was in Syria at the time, heard of this, he rushed back to Egypt, avoiding Damietta, instead reaching Mansurah. There, he organized an army and raised a commando force which harassed the Crusaders.

As-Salih Ayyub was ill and his health deteriorated further due to the mounting pressure from the Crusader offensive. His wife Shajar al-Durr called a meeting of all the war generals and thus became commander-in-chief of the Egyptian forces. She ordered the fortification of Mansurah and then stored large quantities of provisions and concentrated her forces there. She also organized a fleet of war galleys and scattered them at various strategic points along the Nile River. Crusader attempts to capture Mansurah were thwarted and King Louis found himself in a critical position. He managed to cross the Nile to launch a surprise attack against Mansurah. Meanwhile, as-Salih Ayyub died, but Shajar al-Durr and as-Salih Ayyub&#x27;s Bahri Mamluk generals, including Rukn al-Din Baybars and Aybak, countered the assault and inflicted heavy losses on the Crusaders. Simultaneously, Egyptian forces cut off the Crusader&#x27;s line of supply from Damietta, preventing the arrival of reinforcements. As-Salih Ayyub&#x27;s son and the newly proclaimed Ayyubid sultan al-Mu&#x27;azzam Turan-Shah reached Mansurah at this point and intensified the battle against the Crusaders. The latter ultimately surrendered at the Battle of Fariskur, and King Louis and his companions were arrested.

Al-Mu&#x27;azzam Turan-Shah alienated the Mamluks soon after their victory at Mansurah and constantly threatened them and Shajar al-Durr. Fearing for their positions of power, the Bahri Mamluks revolted against the sultan and killed him in April 1250. Aybak married Shajar al-Durr and subsequently took over the government in Egypt in the name of al-Ashraf II who became sultan, but only nominally.

====Dominance of Aleppo====
Intent on restoring the supremacy of Saladin&#x27;s direct descendants within the Ayyubid family, an-Nasir Yusuf was eventually able to enlist the backing of all of the Syria-based Ayyubid &quot;emirs&quot; in a common cause against Mamluk-dominated Egypt. By 1250, he took Damascus with relative ease and except for Hama and Transjordan, an-Nasir Yusuf&#x27;s direct authority stood unbroken from the Khabur River in northern Mesopotamia to the Sinai Peninsula. In December 1250, he attacked Egypt after hearing of al-Mu&#x27;azzam Turan-Shah&#x27;s death and the ascension of Shajar al-Durr. An-Nasir Yusuf&#x27;s army was much larger and better-equipped than that of the Egyptian army, consisting of the forces of Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and those of Saladin&#x27;s only surviving sons, Nusrat ad-Din and Turan-Shah ibn Salah ad-Din. Nonetheless, it suffered a major defeat at the hands of Aybak&#x27;s forces. An-Nasir Yusuf subsequently returned to Syria, which was slowly slipping out of his control.

The Mamluks forged an alliance with the Crusaders in March 1252 and agreed to jointly launch a campaign against an-Nasir Yusuf. King Louis, who had been released after al-Mu&#x27;azzam Turan-Shah&#x27;s murder, led his army to Jaffa, while Aybak intended to send his forces to Gaza. Upon hearing of the alliance, an-Nasir Yusuf immediately dispatched a force to Tell al-Ajjul, just outside Gaza, in order to prevent the junction of the Mamluk and Crusader armies. Meanwhile, the rest of the Ayyubid army was stationed in the Jordan Valley. Realizing that a war between them would greatly benefit the Crusaders, Aybak and an-Nasir Yusuf accepted Abbasid mediation via Najm ad-Din al-Badhirai. In April 1253, a treaty was signed whereby the Mamluks would retain control over all of Egypt and Palestine up to, but not including, Nablus, while an-Nasir Yusuf would be confirmed as the ruler of Muslim Syria. Thus, Ayyubid rule was officially ended in Egypt. After conflict arose between the Mamluks and the Ayyubids reignited, al-Badhirai arranged another treaty, this time giving an-Nasir Yusuf control of the Mamluks&#x27; territories in Palestine and al-Arish in Sinai. Instead of placing Ayyubids in charge, however, an-Nasir Yusuf handed Jerusalem to a Mamluk named Kutuk while Nablus and Jenin were given to Baibars.

For over a year after the settlement with the Mamluks, calm settled over an-Nasir Yusuf&#x27;s reign, but on 11 December 1256 he sent two envoys to the Abbasids in Baghdad seeking formal investiture from the caliph, al-Musta&#x27;sim, for his role as &quot;Sultan&quot;. This request was connected to an-Nasir&#x27;s rivalry with Aybak, as the title would be useful in future disputes with the Mamluks. However, the Mamluks had sent their envoys to Baghdad previously to precisely ensure that an-Nasir Yusuf would not gain the title, putting al-Musta&#x27;sim in a difficult position.

In early 1257, Aybak was killed in a conspiracy, and was succeeded by his 15-year-old son, al-Mansur Ali, while Saif ad-Din Qutuz held an influential position. Soon after al-Mansur Ali&#x27;s ascendancy rumors of another conspiracy to which an-Nasir Yusuf had an alleged connection emerged. The accused conspirator, al-Mansur Ali&#x27;s vizier, Sharaf ad-Din al-Fa&#x27;izi, was strangled by Egyptian authorities. The Bahri Mamluks in Syria led by Baibars pressured an-Nasir Yusuf to intervene by invading Egypt, but he would not act, fearing the Bahri dynasty would usurp his throne if they gained Egypt.

====Karak asserts independence====
Relations between an-Nasir Yusuf and the Bahri Mamluks grew tense after the former refused to invade Egypt. In October 1257, Baibars and his fellow Mamluks left Damascus or were expelled from the city and together they moved south to Jerusalem. When the governor Kutuk refused to aid them against an-Nasir Yusuf, Baibars deposed him and had al-Mugith Umar, the emir of Karak, pronounced in the &quot;khutba&quot; at the al-Aqsa Mosque; over the years, al-Mugith Umar had allowed the political dissidents of Cairo and Damascus, who sought protection from either the Mamluk and Ayyubid authorities, a safe haven within his territory.

Soon after gaining Jerusalem, Baibars conquered Gaza and an-Nasir Yusuf sent his army to Nablus in response. A battle ensued and the Mamluks ultimately fled across the Jordan River to the Balqa area. From there they reached Zughar at the southern tip of the Dead Sea where they sent their submission to Karak. Al-Mughith Umar&#x27;s new relationship with Baibars solidified his independence from an-Nasir Yusuf&#x27;s Syria. To ensure his independence, al-Mughith Umar began to distribute the territories of Palestine and Transjordan among the Bahri Mamluks. The new allies assembled a small army and headed for Egypt. In spite of initial gains in Palestine and al-Arish, they withdrew after seeing how overwhelmingly outnumbered they were by the Egyptian army. Al-Mughith Umar and Baibars were not discouraged, however, and launched an army 1,500 regular cavalry to Sinai at the beginning of 1258, but again were defeated by the Mamluks of Egypt.

====Mongol invasion and collapse of the empire====

The Ayyubids had been under the nominal sovereignty of the Mongol Empire after a Mongol force targeted Ayyubid territories in Anatolia in 1244. An-Nasir Yusuf sent an embassy to the Mongol capital Karakorum in 1250, shortly after assuming power. These understandings did not last, however, and the Mongol Great Khan, Möngke, issued a directive to his brother Hulagu to extend the realms of the empire to the Nile River. The latter raised an army of 120,000 and in 1258, sacked Baghdad and slaughtered its inhabitants, including Caliph al-Musta&#x27;sim and most of his family after the Ayyubids failed to assemble an army to protect the city. That same year the Ayyubids lost Diyar Bakr to the Mongols.

An-Nasir Yusuf sent a delegation to Hulagu afterward, repeating his protestations to submission. Hulagu refused to accept the terms and so an-Nasir Yusuf called on Cairo for aid. This plea coincided with a successful coup by the Cairo-based Mamluks against the remaining symbolic Ayyubid leadership in Egypt, with strongman Qutuz officially taking power. Meanwhile, an Ayyubid army was assembled at Birzeh, just north of Damascus to defend the city against the Mongols who were now marching towards northern Syria. Aleppo was soon besieged within a week and in January 1260 it fell to the Mongols. The Great Mosque and the Citadel of Aleppo were razed and most of the inhabitants were killed or sold into slavery. The destruction of Aleppo caused panic in Muslim Syria; The Ayyubid emir of Homs, al-Ashraf Musa, offered to ally with Mongols at the approach of their army and was allowed to continue governance of the city by Hulagu. Hama also capitulated without resisting, but did not join forces with the Mongols. An-Nasir Yusuf opted to flee Damascus to seek protection in Gaza.

Hulagu departed for Karakorum and left Kitbuqa, a Nestorian Christian general, to continue the Mongol conquest. Damascus capitulated after the arrival of the Mongol army, but was not sacked like other captured Muslim cities. However, from Gaza, an-Nasir Yusuf managed to rally the small garrison he left in the Citadel of Damascus to rebel against the Mongol occupation. The Mongols retaliated by launching a massive artillery assault on the citadel and when it became apparent that an-Nasir Yusuf was unable to relieve the city with a newly assembled army, the garrison surrendered.

The Mongols proceeded by conquering Samaria, killing most of the Ayyubid garrison in Nablus, and then advanced south, as far as Gaza, unhindered. An-Nasir Yusuf was soon captured by the Mongols and used to persuade the garrison at Ajlun to capitulate. Afterward, the junior Ayyubid governor of Banyas allied with the Mongols, who had now gained control of most of Syria and al-Jazira, effectively ending Ayyubid power in the region. On 3 September 1260, the Egypt-based Mamluk army led by Qutuz and Baibars challenged Mongol authority and decisively defeated their forces in the Battle of Ain Jalut, outside of Zir&#x27;in in the Jezreel Valley. Five days later, the Mamluks took Damascus and within a month, most of Syria was in Bahri Mamluk hands. Meanwhile, an-Nasir Yusuf was killed in captivity.

===Remnants of the dynasty===

Many of the Ayyubid &quot;emirs&quot; of Syria were discredited by Qutuz for collaborating with the Mongols, but since al-Ashraf Musa defected and fought alongside the Mamluks at Ain Jalut, he was allowed to continue his rule over Homs. Al-Mansur of Hama had fought alongside the Mamluks from the start of their conquest and because of this, Hama continued to be ruled by the Ayyubid descendants of al-Muzaffar Umar. After al-Ashraf Musa&#x27;s death in 1262, the new Mamluk sultan, Baibars, annexed Homs. The next year, al-Mughith Umar was tricked into surrendering Karak to Baibars and was executed soon after for having previously sided with the Mongols.

The last Ayyubid ruler of Hama died in 1299 and Hama briefly passed through direct Mamluk suzerainty. However, in 1310, under the patronage of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, Hama was restored to the Ayyubids under the well-known geographer and author Abu al-Fida. The latter died in 1331 and was succeeded by his son al-Afdal Muhammad, who eventually lost the favor of his Mamluk overlords. He was removed from his post in 1341 and Hama was formally placed under Mamluk rule.

In southeastern Anatolia, the Ayyubids continued to rule the principality of Hisn Kayfa and managed to remain an autonomous entity, independent of the Mongol Ilkhanate, which ruled northern Mesopotamia until the 1330s. After the breakup of the Ilkhanate, their former vassals in the area, the Artuqids, waged war against the Ayyubids of Hisn Kayfa in 1334, but were decisively defeated, with the Ayyubids gaining the Artuqids&#x27; possessions on the left bank of the Tigris River. In the 14th century, the Ayyubids rebuilt the castle of Hisn Kayfa which served as their stronghold. The Ayyubids of Hisn Kayfa were vassals of the Mamluks and later the Dulkadirids until being supplanted by the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century.

==Military==
Fundamentally, Saladin&#x27;s army, which grew out of Nur ad-Din&#x27;s army, was mainly based on Kurdo-Turkic troops, alongside some Fatimid and Arab tribal contingents. Kurds made up one-third of Saladin&#x27;s army and were mostly organized in tribal units and corps, such as al-Hakkariyya, al-Mehraniyya (branch of Hadhbāni), al-Humaydiyya and al-Zarzariyya. In 1181, Saladin&#x27;s Egyptian army was composed of 111 amirs, 6,976 &quot;tawashi&quot; (cavalrymen) and 1,153 &quot;qara-ghulam&quot;s (second grade cavalrymen). In addition to the dominant contribution of Egypt, each urban centre in the Levant and the Jazira maintained contingents depending on its resources, which were called by Saladin when needed. The estimated total of 16,000 regular cavalry were directly subject to Saladin’s command, in addition to 4000 troops which the Zengids of Mosul and the other Zengid principalities supplied. It was with the large bulk of this army, some 12,000 cavalrymen, that Saladin defeated the Crusader forces at Hattin and achieved his later victories. 

Not much is known about how the Ayyubids graded their officer corps. A number of military titles appear in inscriptions on some Ayyubid buildings, including &quot;amir&quot;, &quot;amir al-kabir&quot;, &quot;supasalar&quot; and &quot;amir supasalar&quot;. These might refer to different ranks.

The Ayyubid army largely consisted of free-born soldiers, but the sultan, princes and amirs also acquired their own personal Mamluk contingents. These included, for instance, the &quot;Asadiyya&quot; (named after Asad ad-Din Shirkuh), the &quot;Salahiyya&quot; (after Saladin), the &quot;&#x27;Adiliyya&quot; (after Adil I) , the &quot;Kamiliyya&quot; (after al-Kamil), and others. The lack of unity and the rivalries between these contingents eventually weakened the Ayyubid army. Furthermore, a few traces of ethnic hostility may have existed between Kurds, who were free-born, and Turks who generally made up the Mamluk contingents. Although the army was paid by a monthly salary called &quot;jāmakiyya&quot;, the amirs were often assigned an &quot;iqta&#x27;&quot; (fiefdom) by the sultan or other rulers. From the income of these &quot;iqta&quot;, they were required to provide a specific number of fully equipped and trained cavalrymen when the sultan called them to arms.

==Government==
===Structure===
Saladin structured the Ayyubid empire around the concept of collective sovereignty i.e. a confederation of principalities held together by the idea of family rule. Under this arrangement there existed numerous &quot;petty sultans&quot; while one family member, &quot;as-Sultan al-Mu&#x27;azzam&quot;, reigned supreme. After the death of Saladin, this coveted position became open to whoever was strong enough to seize it. Subsequent rivalry between the Ayyubids of Syria and Egypt reached a point where the rulers of each territory would at times collude with Crusaders against the other. Ayyubid rule differed in these two regions. In Syria, each major city was ruled as a relatively independent principality under an Ayyubid family member, while in Egypt the long tradition of centralized rule enabled the Ayyubids to maintain direct control over the province from Cairo. It was Baghdad, seat of the Caliphate, however, that exercised cultural and political hegemony over the Ayyubid territories, particularly those in Southwest Asia. For instance, the &quot;qadi&quot; (&quot;chief justice&quot;) of Damascus was still appointed by the Abbasids during Ayyubid rule.

Political power was concentrated in the Ayyubid household which was not necessarily characterized only by blood relation; slaves and intimates could acquire great, and even supreme power within it. It was a common occurrence for the mothers of young Ayyubid rulers to act as independent powers or in a few cases, rulers in their own right. Eunuchs exercised substantial power under the Ayyubids, serving as attendants and atabegs within the household or as &quot;emirs&quot;, governors, and army commanders outside the household. One of Saladin&#x27;s most important supporters was the eunuch Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad who helped him depose the Fatimids, dispossess their properties, and construct the wall of Cairo&#x27;s citadel. Following the death of al-Aziz Uthman, he became the regent of his son al-Mansur and effectively ruled over Egypt for a short time before the arrival of al-Adil. Later sultans appointed eunuchs as deputy sultans and even awarded them sovereignty over certain cities, such as Shams al-Din Sawab who was given the Jaziran cities of Amid and Diyar Bakr in 1239.

The Ayyubids had three principal means of recruiting the educated elites whom they needed to administer their cities and towns. Some of these local leaders, known as &quot;shaykhs&quot;, entered the service of an Ayyubid ruling household and thus their bids for power were supported from Ayyubid household revenues and influence. Others were paid directly out of revenues made from the &quot;diwan&quot;, a high governmental body of the state. The third method was assignment to the &quot;shaykhs&quot; of the revenues of charitable endowments, known as &quot;waqfs&quot;. The Ayyubids, like their various predecessors in the region, had relatively few state agencies by which they could penetrate their cities and towns. To link themselves with the educated elite of their cities, they relied on the political usage of patronage practices. The assignment of &quot;waqf&quot; revenue to this elite was similar to the assignment of fiefs (&quot;iqta&#x27;at&quot;) to the commanders and generals of the army. In both cases, it enabled the Ayyubids to recruit a dependent, but not administratively subordinate elite.
Following their conquest of Jerusalem in 1187, the Ayyubids under Saladin may have been the first to establish the position of &quot;amir al-hajj&quot; (commander of the pilgrimage) to protect the annual Hajj caravans leaving Damascus for Mecca with the appointment of Tughtakin ibn Ayyub to the office.

===Seat of government===
The seat of Ayyubid government from Saladin&#x27;s rule from the 1170s up to al-Adil&#x27;s reign in 1218 had been Damascus. The city provided a strategic advantage in the constant war with the Crusaders and allowed the sultan to keep an eye on his relatively ambitious vassals in Syria and al-Jazira. Cairo was too remote to serve as a base of operations, but had always served as the economic foundation of the empire. This rendered the city a critical constituent in the repertoire of the Ayyubid possessions. When Saladin was proclaimed sultan in Cairo in 1171, he chose the Fatimid-built Lesser Western Palace (part of a larger palace complex in Cairo isolated from the urban sprawl) as the seat of government. Saladin himself resided in the former Fatimid vizier palace, Turan-Shah took up a former Fatimid prince&#x27;s living quarter, and their father occupied the Pearl Pavilion which was situated outside of Cairo overlooking the city&#x27;s canal. The successive Ayyubid sultans of Egypt would live in the Lesser Western Palace.

After al-Adil I seized the throne in Cairo and with it the sultanate of the Ayyubid oligarchy, the period of rivalry between Damascus and Cairo to become capital of the Ayyubid empire commenced. Under al-Adil and al-Kamil, Damascus continued as an autonomous province whose ruler reserved the right to designate his own heir, but during as-Salih Ayyub&#x27;s rule, military campaigns against Syria reduced Damascus to a vassal of Cairo. In addition, Ayyub established new rules both in administration and government in order to centralize his regime; he conferred the most prominent positions of the state to his close confidants, instead of his Ayyubid relatives. His wife Shajar al-Durr, for example, managed the affairs of Egypt while he was in Syria. Ayyub officially delegated his authority to his dead son Khalil and made al-Durr act formally on Khalil&#x27;s behalf.

===Iqta&#x27; system===

Saladin established the &quot;iqta&#x27;&quot; system that remained in practice until the end of Ayyubid rule. The &quot;iqta&quot; system of the Ayyubids was modeled after the Seljuk system, but was more centralized. An Ayyubid fief holder had two different kinds of fiefs: a special one (&quot;khassa&quot;), for his own personal needs, and another one called &quot;iqta&#x27;&quot;, for the maintenance of his troops. Ayyubid feudalism in Egypt differed from the feudal system in the other parts of the sultanate (Syria and Al-Jazirah), as the Ayyubid feudal lords in Syria had more power and independence than their Egyptian counterparts. The &quot;iqta&quot;&#x27; was held mainly by Ayyubid dynasty members, Kurds or Mamluks. The Kurdish fief holders consisted of four tribes, the al-Hakkariyya, al-Humaydiyya, al-Mihraniyya and al-Zarzariyya. However, during the reign of al-Salih Ayyub, the al-Qaymariyya became the dominant Kurdish tribe within the Ayyubid military oligarchy.

==Demographics==
===Religion, ethnicity and language===
By the 12th century, Islam was the dominant religion in the Middle East. It is not certain, however, if it was the religion of the majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians were speaking Arabic by the time the Ayyubids took power there.

Kurdish was the mother tongue of the Ayyubids, at the time of their departure from Dvin. Sultan Saladin spoke both Arabic and Kurdish, and likely Turkish as well. There was a strong ethnic consciousness between the Ayyubids and other Kurds. According to the historian R. Stephen Humphreys, Saladin obtained the Fatimid vizierate partly on the strength of it. Kurdish ethnic consciousness was reinforced by the existence of ethnic friction. After Shirkuh&#x27;s death, Saladin&#x27;s close associate Diya&#x27; al-Din Isa al-Hakkari, a Kurd, visited the leaders of each faction contending for power to try to win them over to the election of Saladin, and to one Kurdish emir, Qutb al-Din Khusrau ibn al-Talal, he used the following argument: &quot;Verily, everybody is for Saladin except you and al-Yaruqi [a Turkmen amir from the north Syrian Yürük tribe]. What is needed now, above all, is an understanding between you and Saladin, especially because of his Kurdish origin, so that the command does not go from him to the Turks.&quot; Within a few months of Saladin&#x27;s election, all the Turkish amirs had returned to Syria save those in the late Shirkuh&#x27;s Asadiyya corps.

The Ayyubid period represents the climax of Kurdish integration in Egypt and Syria, to the extent that the Ayyubid dynasty appeared as Kurdish dynasty par excellence. the Ayyubids acted as a Kurdish dynasty, functioning as a tribal catalyst. Kurds from various tribes and social status occupied high positions within the Ayyubid realm, from military to religious elites. The Ayyubids reinforced the nexus between the Sultanate and their Kurdish kinsmen, while the Kurds maintained their tribal ethos, solidarities and link to their original homeland. The Ayyubids were referred to as the ‘Kurdish dynasty’ (dawlat al-akrād) in Islamic sources.

According to Yasser Tabbaa, an anthropologist specializing in medieval Islamic culture, the Ayyubid rulers who reigned in the late 12th-century were far removed from their Kurdish origins, and unlike their Seljuq predecessors and their Mamluk successors, they were firmly &quot;Arabized.&quot; Arabic culture and language formed the main component of their identity instead of their Kurdish heritage. Arabic surnames were much more prevalent among the Ayyubids, a tribe that had already been partially assimilated into the Arabic-speaking world before its members came to power, than non-Arabic names. However, the Ayyubids continued their connection with their original homeland, that&#x27;s Iranic culture. As it&#x27;s evidant that Al-Adil along with his son and successor, Al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa spoke Kurdish and perhaps even Persian. As Al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa ordered the translation of Shahnameh into Arabic, the translation was completed in 1224 by the well-known writer Fath ibn Ali al-Bundari. Some Iranic romanticism can be detected in names such as Shahan-Shah, Bahram-Shah, farrukh-Shah and &quot;Turan-Shah. Under the Ayyubids, many scholars note that Kurmanji gained a privileged status but admit that there is a paucity of evidence due to the lack of written Kurmanji documents from the Ayyubid court. Most of the Ayyubid rulers spoke fluent Arabic and a number of them, such as az-Zahir Ghazi, al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa and the minor emirs of Hama, composed Arabic poetry. Al-Salih Ayyub, however, did not write poetry, but was a patron of two great Arab poets, Baha al-Din Zuhayr and Ibn Matrouh.&quot;

Kurds and free born Kurdish mercenaries dominated the cavalry and nomadic Turcomans and Arabs filled the ranks of the infantry. These groups typically settled in the pastoral areas outside of the cities, the centers of cultural life, and as such they were relatively isolated from the Arabic-dominant urban environment. This isolation allowed them to preserve their traditions. Like their Fatimid predecessors, the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt maintained a substantial force of &quot;mamluks&quot; (military slaves). By the first half of the 13th century &quot;mamluks&quot; were mostly drawn from Kipchak Turks and Circassians and there is strong evidence that these forces continued to speak Kipchak Turkish.
In Egypt, there were large communities of Coptic Christians, Melkites, Turks, Armenians, and Black Africans. Coptic Christians, who had formed the majority of Egypt&#x27;s population during the early Islamic period, remained a substantial minority. The native Coptic language had by this point largely ceased to be spoken but continued as a literary and liturgical language. The translation of Coptic literature into Arabic, which had begun in preceding centuries, also accelerated during the 13th century, engendering a &quot;Coptic Renaissance&quot; that enabled Coptic identity to be preserved within a wider Arabic cultural environment. 

Under the Fatimids, non-Muslims in Egypt generally prospered, with the exception of Caliph al-Hakim&#x27;s reign. However, with Shirkuh&#x27;s ascendancy to the vizier position, a number edicts were enacted against the non-Muslim population. With the advent of the Syrian expeditionary force (consisting of Oghuz Turks and Kurds) into Egypt, waves of maltreatment of minorities occurred, irrespective of religion. These incidents occurred while Shirkuh and Saladin were viziers to the Fatimid caliph.

At the beginning of Saladin&#x27;s reign as sultan in Egypt, upon the encouragement of his adviser, Qadi al-Fadil, Christians were prohibited from employment in the fiscal administration, but various Ayyubid emirs continued to allow Christians to serve in their posts. A number of other regulations were imposed, including the bans on alcohol consumption, religious processions, and the ringing of church bells. Conversion of formerly high-ranking Christians and their families to Islam took place throughout the early period of Ayyubid rule. According to historian Yaakov Lev, the persecution of non-Muslims had some permanent effects on them, but nonetheless, the effects were local and contained. To manage Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids permitted Europeans—mainly Italians, but also French and Catalans—to settle in Alexandria in large numbers. However, in the aftermath of the Fifth Crusade, 3,000 merchants from the area were arrested or expelled.

The majority of Syria&#x27;s population in the 12th century consisted of Sunni Muslims, typically from Arab or Kurdish backgrounds. There were also sizable Muslim communities of Twelver Shias, Druzes, and Alawites. The Ismaili presence was small and most were of Persian origin, having migrated from Alamut. They mostly resided in the mountainous area near the northern Syrian coastline. Large Christian communities existed in northern Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and Upper Mesopotamia. They were Aramaic-speaking and indigenous to the area, mostly belonging to the Syriac Orthodox Church. They lived in villages of Christian or mixed Christian and Muslim population, monasteries, and in small towns where they appear to have been on friendly terms with their Muslim neighbors. Ideologically, they were led by the Patriarch of Antioch.

In Yemen and Hadramaut, much of the population adhered to Shia Islam in its Zaydi form. The inhabitants of Upper Mesopotamia were made up of Sunni Muslim Kurds and Turks, although there was a significant Yazidi minority in that region as well. Jews were spread throughout the Islamic world and most Ayyubid cities had Jewish communities due to the important roles Jews played in trade, manufacture, finance, and medicine. In Yemen and some parts of Syria, Jews also lived in rural towns. The Ayyubid &quot;emir&quot; of Yemen in 1197–1202, al-Malik Mu&#x27;izz Isma&#x27;il, attempted to forcibly convert the Jews of Aden, but this process ceased after his death in 1202. Within the Jewish community, particularly in Egypt and Palestine, there existed a minority of Karaites.

The Ayyubids generally employed Kurds, Turks, and people from the Caucasus for the higher-ranking posts of the military and bureaucratic fields. Not much is known about the foot soldiers of the Ayyubid army, but the numbers of cavalrymen are known to have fluctuated between 8,500 and 12,000. The cavalry was largely composed of free-born Kurds and Turks whom Ayyubid &quot;emirs&quot; and sultans purchased as military slaves or &quot;mamluks&quot;; in the early days of the Ayyubids, there was also a large contingent of Turkomans. In addition, there existed Arab auxiliaries, former Fatimid units such as the Nubians, and separate Arab contingents—notably from the Kinaniyya tribe, who were largely devoted to the defense of Egypt. Rivalry between Kurdish and Turkish troops occurred occasionally when leading positions were at stake and towards the end of Ayyubid rule, Turks outnumbered Kurds in the army. Despite their Kurdish background, the sultans remained impartial to both groups.

===Population===
There is no accurate figure for the population of the various territories under Ayyubid rule. Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones suggest that in the 12th century, Syria had a population of 2.7 million, Palestine and Transjordan had 500,000 inhabitants, and Egypt had a population of under 5 million. Josiah C. Russel states that in this same period there were 2.4 million people in Syria living in 8,300 villages, leaving a population of 230,000–300,000 living in ten cities, eight of which were Muslim cities under Ayyubid control. The largest were Edessa (pop. 24,000), Damascus (pop. 15,000), Aleppo (pop. 14,000), and Jerusalem (pop. 10,000). Smaller cities included Homs, Hama, Gaza, and Hebron.

Russel estimated the Egyptian village population to be 3.3 million in 2,300 villages, a high density for rural populations in the time period. He attributes it to the high productivity of Egyptian soil which allowed for increased agricultural growth. The urban population was much lower, 233,100, consisting of 5.7% of the total Egyptian population. The largest cities were Cairo (pop. 60,000), Alexandria (pop. 30,000), Qus (pop. 25,000), Damietta (pop. 18,000), Fayyum (pop. 13,000), and Bilbeis (pop. 10,000). Numerous smaller cities dotted the Nile River. Among the latter were Damanhur, Asyut, and Tanta. Cities in Egypt were also densely populated, mainly because of greater urbanization and industrialization than elsewhere.

==Economy==
Having pushed the Crusaders out of most of Syria, the Ayyubids generally adopted a policy of peace with them. The war with the Crusaders did not prevent Muslims under Ayyubid governance from developing good commercial relations with European states. This led to fruitful interaction between both sides in different fields of economic activity, particularly in agriculture and trade.

Numerous measures were undertaken by the Ayyubids to increase agricultural production. Canals were dug to facilitate the irrigation of agricultural lands throughout the empire. Cultivation of sugarcane was officially encouraged to meet the great demand of it by both the local inhabitants and the Europeans. Meanwhile, as a result of the Crusades, several new plants were introduced to Europe, including sesame, carob, millet, rice, lemons, melons, apricots, and shallots.

The main factor which boosted industry and trade under the Ayyubids was the new interests Europeans developed when they came into contact with the Muslims. Commodities included incense, scents, fragrant oils, and aromatic plants from Arabia and India, as well as ginger, alum, and aloes. Likewise, Europeans developed new tastes in the matter of fashions, clothing, and home furnishing. Rugs, carpets, and tapestries manufactured in the Middle East and Central Asia were introduced to the West through Crusader-Ayyubid interaction. Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem returned with Arab reliquaries for the keeping of relics. In addition, eastern works of art in glass, pottery, gold, silver, etc., were highly prized in Europe.

The European demand for agricultural products and industrial commodities stimulated maritime activity and international trade to an unprecedented extent. The Ayyubids played a leading role in this as they controlled sea-trade routes which passed through the ports of Yemen and Egypt via the Red Sea. The trade policy of the Ayyubids placed them in a position of great advantage; although they cooperated with the Genoans and Venetians in the Mediterranean Sea, they prevented them from having access to the Red Sea. Thus, they kept the trade of the Indian Ocean exclusively in their hands. In the Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids also profited through taxes and commissions levied upon Italian merchants.

Upon the development of international trade, the elementary principles of credit and banking were developed. Both Jewish and Italian merchants had regular banking agents in Syria, who transacted business on behalf of their masters. Bills of exchange were also used by them in their dealings with one another and money was deposited in various banking centers throughout Syria. The encouragement of trade and industry provided the Ayyubid sultans with the funds needed for military expenditure as well as for developmental and everyday lifestyle works. Special attention was made to the economic state of the empire under al-Adil and al-Kamil. The latter maintained a strict control over expenditure; it is said that on his death he left a treasury which was equivalent to the budget of one full year.

===Education===
Being well-educated themselves, the Ayyubid rulers became munificent patrons of learning and educational activity. Different &quot;madrasa&quot;-type schools were built by them throughout the empire, not only for education, but also to popularize knowledge of Sunni Islam. According to Ibn Jubayr, under Saladin, Damascus had 30 schools, 100 baths, and a large number of Sufi &quot;dervish&quot; monasteries. He also built several schools in Aleppo, Jerusalem, Cairo, Alexandria, and in various cities in the Hejaz. Similarly, many schools were built by his successors also. Their wives and daughters, commanders, and nobles established and financed numerous educational institutions as well.

Although the Ayyubids were from the Shafi&#x27;i denomination, they built schools for imparting instruction in all four of the Sunni systems of religious-juridical thought. Before the Ayyubid takeover, there were no schools for the Hanbali and Maliki denominations in Syria, but the Ayyubids founded separate schools for them. In the mid-13th century, Ibn Shaddad counted in Damascus 40 Shafi&#x27;i, 34 Hanafi, 10 Hanbali, and three Maliki schools.

When Saladin restored Sunni orthodoxy in Egypt, 10 &quot;madrasas&quot; were established in Cairo during his reign, and an additional 25 during the entire Ayyubid period of rule. Each of their locations had religious, political, and economic significance, in particular those in al-Fustat. Most of the schools were dedicated to the Shafi&#x27;i denomination, but others belonged to the Maliki and Hanafi &quot;madhabs&quot;. The &quot;madrasas&quot; built near the tomb of Imam al-Shafi&#x27;i were located adjacent to the important centers of pilgrimage and were a major focus of Sunni devotion.

About 26 schools were built in Egypt, Jerusalem and Damascus by high-ranking government officials, and unusual for the time, commoners also founded in Egypt about 18 schools, including two medical institutions. Most schools were residential whereby both teachers and students resided as a rule. The teachers appointed were jurists, theologians, and traditionalists who received their salary from endowments to the institutions they taught in. Each student was offered a lodging where he would resort, a teacher to instruct him in whatever art he requested, and regular grants to cover all his needs. &quot;Madrasas&quot; were considered prestigious institutions in society. Under the Ayyubids, it was not possible to obtain a job in the government without receiving an education from a &quot;madrasa&quot;.

==Science and medicine==
The facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in different branches of knowledge and learning throughout the territories they controlled. They took special interest in the fields of medicine, pharmacology, and botany. Saladin built and maintained two hospitals in Cairo emulating the well-known Nuri Hospital in Damascus which not only treated patients, but also provided medical schooling. Many scientists and physicians flourished in this period in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. Among them were Maimonides, Ibn Jami, Abdul Latif al-Baghdadi, al-Dakhwar, Rashidun al-Suri, and Ibn al-Baitar. Some of these scholars served the Ayyubid household directly, becoming the personal physicians of sultans.

==Architecture==

Military architecture was the supreme expression of the Ayyubid period, as well as an eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, especially in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni &quot;madrasas&quot;. The most radical change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also inherited from the Fatimids like machicolations and round towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.

Muslim women, particularly those from the Ayyubid family, the families of local governors, and the families of the &quot;ulema&quot; (&quot;religious scholars&quot;) took an active role in Ayyubid architecture. Damascus witnessed the most sustained patronage of religious architecture by women. They were responsible for the construction of 15 &quot;madrasas&quot;, six Sufi hospices, and 26 religious and charitable institutions. In Aleppo, the Firdaws Madrasa, known as the most impressive Ayyubid building in Syria, had regent queen Dayfa Khatun as its patron.

In September 1176, construction of the Cairo Citadel began under Saladin&#x27;s orders. According to al-Maqrizi, Saladin chose the Muqattam Hills to build the citadel because the air there was fresher than anywhere else in the city, but its construction was not so much determined by the salubrious atmosphere; rather it was out of defensive necessity and example of existing fortresses and citadels in Syria. The walls and towers of the northern section of the citadel are largely the works of Saladin and al-Kamil. Al-Kamil completed the citadel; he strengthened and enlarged some of the existing towers (such as two of Saladin&#x27;s towers that were enlarged by totally encasing them in semi-circular units), and also added a number of square towers which served as self-contained keeps. According to Richard Yeomans, the most impressive of al-Kamil&#x27;s structures was the series of massive rectangular keeps which straddled the walls of the northern enclosure. All of al-Kamil&#x27;s fortifications can be identified by their embossed, rusticated masonry, whereas Saladin&#x27;s towers have smooth dressed stones. This heavier rustic style became a common feature in other Ayyubid fortifications, and can be seen in the Citadel of Damascus and that of Bosra in Syria.

Aleppo underwent major transformations in the Ayyubid period, specifically during the reign of az-Zahir Ghazi. Ayyubid architectural achievements focused on four areas: the citadel, the waterworks, fortifications, and the extramural developments. The total rebuilding of the city enclosure began when az-Zahir Ghazi removed the vallum of Nur ad-Din—which by then outlived its temporary need—and rebuilt the northern and northwestern walls—the most susceptible to outside attack—from Bab al-Jinan to Bab al-Nasr. He parceled out the building of the towers on this stretch of the wall to his princes and military officers; each tower was identified with a particular prince who inscribed his name into it. Later, az-Zahir Ghazi extended the eastern wall to the south and east, reflecting his desire to incorporate a dilapidated fortress, Qala&#x27;at al-Sharif, outside the city into Aleppo&#x27;s enclosure. Bab Qinnasrin was completely rebuilt by an-Nasir Yusuf in 1256. This gate stands today as a masterpiece of medieval Syrian military architecture. Cumulatively, Ayyubid architecture left a lasting impression in Aleppo. The citadel was rebuilt, the water network was expanded, and streets and quarters were provided fountains and baths. In addition, dozens of shrines, mosques, &quot;madrasas&quot;, and mausoleums were built throughout the city.

The Ayyubid period in Jerusalem following its conquest by Saladin was marked by a huge investment in the construction of houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of the Dome of the Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome&#x27;s drum. The &quot;mihrab&quot; of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.

<doc id="219948" wikidata="Q26372" url="?curid=219948" title="Takeshi Kitano">
<text>, also known as in Japan, is a Japanese comedian, actor, and filmmaker. While he is known primarily as a comedian and TV host in his native Japan, he is better known abroad for his work as a filmmaker and actor as well as TV host.

During his time as a student at Meiji University, he became a comedian at the strip theater France-za in Asakusa, Tokyo. In 1973, he formed a comedy duo called Two Beat with Kiyoshi Kaneko, who later became Beat Kiyoshi. Kitano adopted the stage name Beat Takeshi. Riding the wave of the comedy boom, he gained popularity with satirical and sharp-tongued black humor. In the 1980s, he appeared in TV shows such as &quot;Oretachi Hyōkin-zoku&quot; which recorded the highest viewership rating of 29.1%, and &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; which recorded 24.7%, becoming explosively popular on television. He gained recognition as an actor in director Nagisa Ōshima&#x27;s film &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot; (1983). In 1989, he made his directorial debut with the film &quot;Violent Cop&quot; after Kinji Fukasaku stepped down. He won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for his film &quot;Hana-bi&quot; (1997), becoming the third Japanese director to receive this honor after Akira Kurosawa and Hiroshi Inagaki. In October 2017, Kitano completed his &quot;Outrage&quot; crime trilogy with the release of &quot;Outrage Coda&quot;. He is also known internationally for hosting the game show &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1986–1990) and starring in the film &quot;Battle Royale&quot; (2000).

He has received critical acclaim for his idiosyncratic cinematic work, winning numerous awards with Japanese film critic Nagaharu Yodogawa having once dubbed him &quot;the true successor&quot; to influential filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. Many of Kitano&#x27;s films are dramas about &quot;yakuza&quot; gangsters or the police. Described by critics as using an acting style that is highly deadpan or a camera style that approaches near-stasis, Kitano often uses long takes during which little appears to be happening, or editing that cuts immediately to the aftermath of an event. Many of his films express a bleak worldview, but are also filled with humor and affection for their characters.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Takeshi Kitano was born in Adachi, Tokyo, with two older brothers and an older sister. His father worked as a house painter, with Kitano revealing that he used to live like a yakuza, while his mother was a strict disciplinarian and educator who worked in a factory. In his working-class neighborhood, the children looked up to baseball players and yakuza, with many of his neighbors being the latter. Kitano entered Meiji University and studied engineering, before dropping out at age 19. He went to the Asakusa district in 1972 to become a comedian. While working as an elevator operator at the Asakusa France-za strip club, he became an apprentice of its comedian Senzaburo Fukami and eventually the theater&#x27;s MC.

===Comedy career and success===
In the 1970s, he formed a comedy duo with his friend Nirō Kaneko (also called Kiyoshi Kaneko). They took on the stage names &quot;Beat Takeshi&quot; and &quot;Beat Kiyoshi&quot;; together referring to themselves as . This sort of duo comedy, known as &quot;manzai&quot; in Japan, usually features a great deal of high-speed back-and-forth banter between the two performers. Kiyoshi played the straight man (&quot;tsukkomi&quot;) against Takeshi&#x27;s funny man (&quot;boke&quot;). In 1976, they performed on television for the first time and became a success, propelling their act onto the national stage. The reason for their popularity had much to do with Kitano&#x27;s material, which was much more risqué than traditional &quot;manzai&quot;. The targets of his jokes were often the socially vulnerable, including the elderly, the handicapped, the poor, children, women, the ugly and the stupid. Complaints to the broadcaster led to censorship of some of Kitano&#x27;s jokes and the editing of offensive dialogue. Kitano confirmed in a video interview that he was forbidden to access the NHK studios for five years for having exposed his body during a show when it was totally forbidden.

Although Two Beat was one of the most successful acts of its kind during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Kitano decided to go solo and the duo was dissolved. Together with Sanma Akashiya and Tamori, Kitano is said to be one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; television comedians (&quot;owarai&quot; &quot;tarento&quot;) of Japan. Some autobiographical elements relating to his &quot;manzai&quot; career can be found in his 1996 film &quot;Kids Return&quot;. Beat Kiyoshi has a bit part in Kitano&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Kikujiro&quot;, as &quot;Man at the Bus Stop&quot;. Kitano had also become a popular television host. &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; was a game show hosted by Kitano in the 1980s, featuring slapstick-style physical contests. It was broadcast years later in the United States under the title &quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge&quot;, with Takeshi renamed &quot;Vic Romano&quot;.

Many of Kitano&#x27;s routines involved him portraying a gangster or other harsh characters. Kitano said that after playing comedy clubs he would be invited to drink with yakuza, who would tell him stories about the big crime bosses. His first major film role was in Nagisa Oshima&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot; (cast as a tough POW camp sergeant during World War II opposite Tom Conti, Ryuichi Sakamoto and David Bowie). Kitano said that he was happy with his performance and snuck into a showing of the film to see how the audience would accept him as a serious actor instead of a comedian. He was devastated when the audience burst into laughter upon his appearing on screen, but vowed to stick to serious and dark characters in film.

In 1986, Kitano worked on the Family Computer video game &quot;Takeshi no Chōsenjō&quot; (translated as &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Challenge&quot;), as a consultant and partial designer. He was the first Japanese celebrity to actively contribute to the development of a video game and starred in several commercials promoting its release. Due to the title&#x27;s difficulty and confusing gameplay mechanics, it was placed first in Famitsu magazine&#x27;s &quot;kusoge&quot; (shit game) ranking, and is often referred to as one of the worst video games of all time. &quot;Takeshi no Chōsenjō&quot; and its development was later the subject of the first episode of &quot;GameCenter CX&quot;, a gaming variety show hosted by Osaka comedian Shinya Arino.

In 1988, he published a memoir, &quot;Asakusa Kid&quot;. He has also published a number of novels and other books which have been translated into French. He co-founded the Agency Office Kitano with Masayuki Mori.

After several other acting roles, mostly comedic, in 1989 he was cast as the lead in &quot;Violent Cop&quot;. When director Kinji Fukasaku stepped down over scheduling conflicts with Kitano, due to Kitano&#x27;s TV commitments, the distributor suggested the comedian direct it at his own pace. He also rewrote the script heavily, and this marked the beginning of Kitano&#x27;s career as a filmmaker.

===1990–2000: Film recognition===

Kitano&#x27;s second film as director and first as screenwriter was &quot;Boiling Point&quot; (&quot;3-4X10 October&quot;) released in 1990. Mark Schilling cited it as the film in which Kitano defined his style with long takes, minimal camera movement, brief dialogue, sly humor, and sudden violence.

Kitano&#x27;s third film, &quot;A Scene at the Sea&quot;, was released in 1991. It follows a deaf garbage collector who is determined to learn how to surf after discovering a broken surfboard. Kitano&#x27;s more delicate, romantic side came to the fore here, along with his trademark deadpan approach. The film garnered numerous nominations and awards, including Best Film at the prestigious Blue Ribbon Awards. It also started a long-running collaboration with composer Joe Hisaishi, which would last until 2002.

Although 1993&#x27;s &quot;Sonatine&quot; did poorly in Japan, it received rave reviews in Europe when it was shown at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. Kitano plays a Tokyo yakuza who is sent by his boss to Okinawa to help end a gang war there. He is tired of gangster life, and when he finds out the whole mission is a ruse, he welcomes what comes with open arms. All four of his films were screened at the 1994 London Film Festival.

In August 1994, Kitano was involved in a motorscooter accident and suffered injuries that caused partial paralysis of the right-side of his face. As reported by Dan Edwards, Kitano later said that the accident was an &quot;unconscious suicide attempt&quot;. Kitano made &quot;Kids Return&quot; in 1996, soon after his recovery.

The 1995 release of &quot;Getting Any?&quot; (&quot;Minna Yatteruka!&quot;), which was filmed before the accident, showed Kitano returning to his comedy roots. This &quot;Airplane!&quot;-like assemblage of comedic scenes, all centering loosely around a Walter Mitty-type character trying to have sex in a car, met with little acclaim in Japan. Much of the film satirizes popular Japanese culture, such as &quot;Ultraman&quot; or &quot;Godzilla&quot; and even the Zatoichi character that Kitano himself would go on to play eight years later. That year Kitano also appeared in the film adaptation of William Gibson&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, credited by the mononym &quot;Takeshi&quot;, although his on-screen time was greatly reduced for the American cut of the film.

After his motorscooter accident, Kitano took up painting. His paintings have been published in books, featured in gallery exhibitions, and adorn the covers of many of the soundtrack albums for his films. His paintings were featured prominently in his most critically acclaimed film, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Hana-bi&quot;. Although for years already Kitano&#x27;s largest audience had been the foreign arthouse crowd, &quot;Hana-bi&quot; cemented his status internationally as one of Japan&#x27;s foremost modern filmmakers. Although it was not a big success financially, it won the Golden Lion award at the 1997 Venice Film Festival. Kitano himself said it was not until he won this award that he was accepted as a serious director in Japan; prior his films were looked at as just the hobby of a famous comedian.

Among his most significant acting roles were Nagisa Oshima&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Taboo&quot;, in which he played Captain Hijikata Toshizo of the Shinsengumi. &quot;Kikujiro&quot;, released in 1999 and named after his father, was a semi-comedy featuring Kitano as a ne&#x27;er-do-well crook who winds up paired up with a young boy looking for his mother, and goes on a series of misadventures with him.

He hosted &quot;Koko ga Hen da yo Nihonjin&quot; (English translation, &quot;This doesn&#x27;t make sense, Japanese people!&quot;) which was a Japanese TV show that was broadcast weekly from 1998 to 2002, a talk show on which a large panel of Japanese-speaking foreigners from around the world debate current issues in Japanese society. He currently hosts &quot;Unbelievable&quot;, which was relaunched in 2001, and the weekly television program &quot;Beat Takeshi&#x27;s TV Tackle&quot;. &quot;TV Tackle&quot; is a kind of panel discussion among entertainers and politicians regarding controversial current events. Another of his shows is &quot;Sekai Marumie TV&quot; (&quot;The World Exposed&quot;), a weekly collection of various interesting video clips from around the world, often focusing on the weird aspects of other countries. On this show, he plays a childlike idiot, insulting the guests, and usually appearing wearing strange costumes during the show.

===2000–present===

Kitano played a similarly named character in the controversial 2000 Japanese blockbuster &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, which takes place in a future in which a group of teenagers are randomly selected each year to eliminate each other on a deserted island.

His 2000 film &quot;Brother&quot; was deliberately intended to be a hit abroad. Shot in Los Angeles, it starred Kitano as a deposed and exiled Tokyo yakuza setting up a drug empire in Los Angeles with the aid of a local gangster played by Omar Epps. However, the film met with tepid international response. Although in Japan it did better financially than &quot;Hana-bi&quot;. &quot;Dolls&quot; in 2002 had Kitano directing but not starring in a romantic drama with three different stories about undying love, and was loosely based on a bunraku play.

Following the disappointing response to the film &quot;Brother&quot; and the film &quot;Dolls&quot;, Kitano received a sequence of unsympathetic reviews from the press in the United States. Criticism was less severe in Europe and Asia though many commentators were not as lavish with their praise as they had been with his previous films. 2003&#x27;s &quot;Zatōichi&quot;, directed by and starring Kitano, silenced many of these dissenters. With a new take on the character from Shintaro Katsu&#x27;s long-running film and TV series, &quot;Zatōichi&quot; was Kitano&#x27;s biggest box office success in Japan, did quite well in limited release across the world, and won countless awards at home and abroad, including the Silver Lion award at the Venice Film Festival. Kitano revealed that he was approached by others to create the film and therefore differed from his own techniques and followed the common filmmaking process in order to please them and make a pure-entertainment film.

From April 2005 to 2008, Kitano was an instructor at the Graduate School of Visual Arts, Tokyo University of the Arts.

Kitano&#x27;s film, &quot;Takeshis&#x27;&quot; was released in Japan in November 2005, as the first installment in his surrealist autobiographical series. This was followed in 2007, by his second surrealist autobiographical film &quot;Glory to the Filmmaker!&quot; (appearing as Beat Takeshi), and a third in 2008, titled &quot;Achilles and the Tortoise&quot;. In between these films, Kitano appeared in a number of other television projects and smaller projects. In 2007 he appeared in &quot;Dots and Lines&quot; (a TV mini-series) as Jūtarō Torikai. Also in 2007, Kitano appeared in &quot;To Each His Own Cinema&quot; as the projectionist (in the segment &quot;Rencontre unique&quot;) as Beat Takeshi, and in the TV movie &quot;Wada Akiko Satsujin Jiken&quot;. In 2008, he did the voice-over in &quot;The Monster X Strikes Back: Attack the G8 Summit&quot;, for Take-Majin, a heroic monster based on Kitano.

In 2010, the Fondation Cartier pour l&#x27;art contemporain in Paris held a one-man show displaying his paintings and installations. A room in the basement played a 12-hour loop of his work as a TV host.

Kitano&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;Outrage&quot; was screened at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. He admitted he tried something different for &quot;Outrage&quot; by adding a lot of dialogue, stepping back as the main character to make an ensemble piece, and having the feel of a nature documentary watching the characters kill each other. A sequel, 2012&#x27;s &quot;Outrage Beyond&quot;, was screened in competition at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. He also appeared in Yasuo Furuhata&#x27;s 2012 film, &quot;Dearest&quot;. In September 2012, Takeshi Kitano said that the producers wanted him to make a third &quot;Outrage&quot; film depending on the box office. On 7 March 2013, &quot;Minkei News&quot; of Hong Kong reported that Kitano won the Best Director award for &quot;Outrage Beyond&quot; at the 7th Asian Film Awards in Hong Kong.

On 10 August 2013, in an interview reported by John Bleasdale, Kitano revealed his current plans for a sequel to &quot;Outrage Beyond&quot; and an untitled personal film project. As Kitano stated, &quot;Ideally what would happen would be this: &quot;Outrage Beyond&quot; becomes a huge hit, so huge that my producer allows me to make one film I really want to do and then come back to the sequel after I&#x27;ve made the film I really want to do.&quot;

In September 2015, it was announced that Kitano would be contributing his voice and likeness to the character Toru Hirose in the SEGA video game &quot;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life&quot;. This collaboration marked Kitano&#x27;s first involvement with the video game industry in 30 years since the 1986 release of &quot;Takeshi no Chōsenjō&quot;.

Takeshi co-starred in the live action adaptation of the manga &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, marking his return to American cinema nearly twenty years after &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; in 1995. Although he has expressed his dislike of anime and manga in the past, he accepted the role because &quot;even though this stylish piece of entertainment is totally different from the films I&#x27;ve directed, I thought it was interesting that Aramaki, the role I play, is a character who gives off a peculiar vibe and, in various episodes, is set at the core of the characters&#x27; relationships. I&#x27;m looking forward to see how the movie turns out.&quot;

In 2017, Kitano released the third and final installment in the successful &quot;Outrage&quot; series titled &quot;Outrage Coda&quot;.

He left &quot;Office Kitano&quot; in 2018 and became affiliated with &quot;T.N Gon&quot; jp].

Kitano&#x27;s samurai film &quot;Kubi&quot; about the Honnō-ji Incident premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

On the 29th of April 2022 he received the Golden Mulberry Lifetime Achievement Award at the 24th Far East International Film Festival of Udine 2022, in Italy.

<text>This list of [[oil field]]s includes some major oil fields of the past and present.

The list is incomplete; there are more than 25,000 oil and gas fields of all sizes in the world. However, 94% of known oil is concentrated in fewer than 1,500 giant and major fields. Most of the world&#x27;s largest oilfields are located in the Middle East, but there are also supergiant (&gt;10 billion bbls) oilfields in Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Kazakhstan, and Russia.

Amounts listed below, in billions of barrels, are the estimated ultimate recoverable petroleum resources (proved reserves plus cumulative production), given historical production and current extraction technology. Oil shale reserves (perhaps ) and coal reserves, both of which can be converted to liquid petroleum, are not included in this chart. Other non-conventional liquid fuel sources are similarly excluded from this list.

<text>The College of Saint Benedict and Saint John&#x27;s University are two closely related private, Benedictine liberal arts colleges in Minnesota. The College of Saint Benedict is a college for women in St. Joseph and Saint John&#x27;s University is a university for men in Collegeville. Students at the institutions have a shared curriculum and access to the resources of both campuses. Together, the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John&#x27;s University offer over 70 areas of study to undergraduate students, plus graduate programs in nursing and theology.

== History ==

=== College of Saint Benedict ===
The College of Saint Benedict opened in 1913, with six students enrolled, and grew out of St. Benedict&#x27;s Academy, which was founded by Saint Benedict&#x27;s Monastery in 1889. The Benedictine community incorporated CSB in 1961.

In addition to its undergraduate offerings, CSB offers three graduate nursing tracks that confer Doctor of Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing degrees.

=== Saint John&#x27;s University ===
Saint John&#x27;s University is the oldest continuously operating institution of higher learning in Minnesota. It was founded in 1857 by the Benedictine monks of Saint John&#x27;s Abbey. The Benedictine community incorporated SJU in 2012.

In addition to its undergraduate offerings, SJU includes Saint John&#x27;s School of Theology and Seminary (SOT), a graduate school that confers Master of Divinity and master of arts degrees and also prepares seminarians for the priesthood.

Minnesota Public Radio began on January 22, 1967, when KSJR signed on from the campus of Saint John&#x27;s University. The station&#x27;s director of broadcasting was SJU alumnus Bill Kling.

SJU has produced its own coarse-grained bread, Johnnie Bread, since 1856, and used the proceeds to fund projects such as the Abbey Church.

Saint John&#x27;s University operated St. John&#x27;s Indian Industrial School, a Native American residential school from 1885 to 1896. In 1888, Indigenous residential school students represented 47 percent of the university&#x27;s student population.

=== Institutional partnership ===

Starting in 1955, CSB and SJU began offering joint evening classes, where men and women attend classes together on both campuses. They began sharing a common academic program in the 1960s, and a classes now are co-educational and taught by a shared faculty of approximately 300 professors, mostly full-time, permanent appointees. About 3,000 students are enrolled in CSB and SJU.

Prior to 2022, the two institutions were led by separate presidents. Brian J. Bruess became the first person to serve as president of both the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John&#x27;s University on July 1, 2022, succeeding transitional presidents Laurie Hamen and James Mullen.

== Academics ==

Ninety percent of CSB and SJU graduates finish in four years, 95% of CSB and SJU students receive financial aid, and 95% of CSB and SJU alums rate their college experience as good or excellent.

=== Center for Ethical Leadership in Action ===
In 2017, an anonymous donor provided a $10-million gift to create the Center for Ethical Leadership in Action at the College of Saint Benedict. This gift is now used to fund student experiences and research as well as provide financial assistance for students completing unpaid internships.

== Campus ==

The campuses are located on of forests, prairies, and lakes. Since CSB and SJU are located about three and a half miles apart, a regular inter-campus bus service known as &quot;The Link&quot; connects the campuses.

Marcel Breuer, renowned Brutalist architect, designed several buildings on the Saint John&#x27;s campus in the 1960s, including the Saint John&#x27;s Abbey Church and bell banner; Alcuin Library; Peter Engel Science Center; the Ecumenical Institute, and Saints Thomas, Bernard, Boniface, and Patrick Residence Halls.

The central cores of the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John&#x27;s University are both listed as historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places.

The campus area first appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 Census with a population of 1,585.

=== Sustainability ===
CSB and SJU were listed in &quot;The Princeton Review&#x27;s Guide to 361 Green Colleges: 2016 Edition&quot; as an institution that &quot;demonstrates notable commitments to sustainability in their academic offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and career preparation.&quot; The campuses each have their own sustainability office to foster a strong culture of sustainability among the students and the broader community. The institutions signed the American College and University Presidents&#x27; Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) in 2007, which formalized their goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035. Dramatic steps have been taken by CSB/SJU to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the most recent report, Saint John&#x27;s reported a 56 per cent reduction in emissions since 2008 levels. Both institutions also complete STARS reports on sustainability and are signatories of the Catholic Climate Covenant.

Saint John&#x27;s Abbey Energy Farm. The Saint John&#x27;s Abbey is well known for having one of the largest solar fields in the state. The original 3.9-acre facility was built in 2009, and its tracking panels provide the university with about 4% of its annual energy needs and up to 20% of its real-time needs in peak conditions. In 2014, the Solar Farm was expanded to include 616 additional fixed panels. These new panels will allow the Solar Farm to produce more than 600 kilowatts of electricity—enough energy to power up to 30% of the SJU campus in peak conditions, and 6% of its energy annually. This project creates a research opportunity for students and others to compare the performance differences between the two types of panels.

<text>The Standardbred is an American horse breed best known for its ability in harness racing where they compete at either a trot or pace. Developed in North America, the Standardbred is recognized worldwide, and the breed can trace its bloodlines to 18th-century England. They are solid, well-built horses with good dispositions.

== Characteristics ==
Standardbreds are generally well-muscled and similar to, but a bit heavier than, a Thoroughbred, with a large head often with a Roman nose profile, straight neck, sloping shoulder, defined withers, a deep girth, strong bone (legs) and hard feet. Standardbreds average and typically weigh between . They are most often bay, and less frequently brown, black, chestnut, gray or roan. Standardbreds are considered easy-to-train horses with a willing submissive nature.

=== Gaits ===

Standardbreds race either at a trot or pace. In the trot, the horse&#x27;s legs move in diagonal pairs; when the right foreleg moves forward, so does the left hind leg, and vice versa. In the pace each foreleg moves in unison with the hind leg on the same side. However, the breed is able to perform other horse gaits, including the canter, though this gait is penalized in harness racing.
Pacers still retain the ability to trot and do so regularly; however, they are labeled by the gait they race at. Additionally, some trotters are able to pace, but prefer to race at the trot. Today&#x27;s Standardbreds race in the same gait for their whole career, with rare exception. And although the gaits are similar, the pace is faster than the trot.

Today&#x27;s Standardbreds are commonly bred trotters to trotters, and pacers to pacers. Although it is possible for trotters to produce a pacer, these gait-specific breeding practices are causing Standardbreds to differentiate into two subpopulations based on gait, more distinct than some breeds.

The ability to pace is linked to a single-point mutation in gene &quot;DMRT3&quot;, which is expressed in the I6 subdivision of spinal cord neurons; this area is responsible for coordinating the locomotor network controlling limb movements. The point mutation causes early termination of the gene by coding for a stop codon, thus altering the function of this transcription factor. Uniquely, both pacing and trotting American Standardbreds are fixed for the DMRT3 variant. This suggest that there is at least one additional genetic variant that controls trotting and pacing in Standardbreds. However, European Standardbreds are not yet fixed for this &quot;DMRT3&quot; variant, although homozygous individuals have better performance records.

=== Orthopedic diseases ===

Osteochondrosis (OC), osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD), and other related developmental orthopedic diseases (DOD) appear at a high frequency in Standardbreds. OC/OCD is a moderate to highly heritable condition in Standardbreds and similar breeds, and genetic risk factors have been identified. These findings suggest that a change in breeding practices could lower the prevalence within the breed; however, lesions may resolve on their own or can be surgically corrected.

== Breed history ==
In the 17th century, the first trotting races were held in the Americas, usually in fields on horses under saddle. However, by the mid-18th century, trotting races were held on official courses, with the horses in harness. Breeds that have contributed foundation stock to the Standardbred breed included the Narragansett Pacer, Canadian Pacer, Thoroughbred, Norfolk Trotter, Hackney, and Morgan.

The foundation bloodlines of the Standardbred trace to a Thoroughbred foaled in England in 1780 named Messenger. He was a gray stallion imported to the United States in 1788. He sired a number of flat racing horses, but was best known for his great-grandson, Hambletonian 10, also known as Rysdyk&#x27;s Hambletonian, foaled in 1849 and considered the foundation sire of the breed and from whom all Standardbreds descend. Hambletonian 10 was out of a dam with Norfolk Trotter breeding, and the mare and foal were purchased by William Rysdyk, a farm hand from New York state, who successfully raced the colt as a three-year-old against other horses. The horse went on to sire 1,331 offspring, 40 of whom trotted a mile in under 2 minutes 30 seconds.
Another influential sire was the Thoroughbred Diomed, born in 1777. Diomed&#x27;s Thoroughbred grandson American Star, foaled in 1822, was influential in the development of the breed through the mares of his progeny by American Star 14 being bred to Hambletonian 10. When the sport started to gain popularity, more selective breeding was done to produce the faster harness trotter.

The first national Standardbred breed registry was formed in United States in 1879 by the National Association of Trotting Horse Breeders. The name arose due to the &quot;standard&quot; required of breeding stock, to be able to trot or pace a mile within a certain time limit. Every Standardbred had to be able to trot a mile in less than two minutes and 30 seconds. Today, many Standardbreds are faster than this original standard, with several pacing the mile within 1 min, 50 sec, and trotters only a few seconds slower than pacers. Slightly different bloodlines are found in trotters than in pacers, though both can trace their heritage back to Hambletonian 10.

At the foundation of the United States Trotting Association in 1939, a closed stud book was proposed. The studbook was not officially closed until 1973, however, it is likely that it was effectively closed prior. In 2009, in an effort to reduce the loss of genetic diversity within the breed, the United States Trotting Association capped the studbook for all new sires to 140 mares per year. This went into effect immediately for trotting stallions, and gradually for pacing stallions.

== Uses ==

Standardbreds are primarily used for driving and most start their lives headed to the race track.

=== Harness racing ===
Standardbreds are known for their skill in harness racing, being the fastest trotting horses in the world. Because of their speed, Standardbreds are often used to upgrade other breeds of harness racers around the world, such as the Orlov Trotter and French Trotter. In Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, races are held for both trotters and pacers. In continental Europe, all harness races are conducted between trotters. In 1968, New Zealand-bred Cardigan Bay became the first Standardbred horse ever to win US$1 million, and the ninth horse to do so worldwide—the first eight were Thoroughbreds.

=== Post-racing careers ===
The Amish have been purchasing off-the-track Standardbreds for a long time, and almost all Amish horses were first trained in the racing industry. A horse may have become too slow for racing, but it is not too slow for pulling a buggy. Standardbreds have an easy-going nature and readily take to such an environment. By purchasing ex-racehorses, the Amish don&#x27;t need to have breeding programs or raise young horses—there is a ready supply of mature and trained horses.

There are other organizations, such as the Standardbred Pleasure Horse Organization, working to find new homes and uses for retired racing Standardbreds. However, in order to make a good riding horse, some of the harness race training must be undone. For example, getting a Standardbred to canter might be difficult since they have been rebuked for cantering for years.

<text>The Wendell O. Pruitt Homes and William Igoe Apartments, known together as Pruitt–Igoe (), were joint urban housing projects first occupied in 1954 in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. The complex of 33 eleven-story high rises was designed in the modernist architectural style by Minoru Yamasaki. At the time of opening, it was one of the largest public housing developments in the country. It was constructed with federal funds on the site of a former slum as part of the city&#x27;s urban renewal program. Despite being legally integrated, it almost exclusively accommodated African Americans.

Although initially viewed as an improvement over the tenement housing it replaced, living conditions in Pruitt–Igoe began to deteriorate soon after completion. By the mid-1960s it was plagued by poor maintenance and crime, particularly vandalism and juvenile delinquency. Numerous initiatives to reverse the decline failed, and by 1970 more than two-thirds of the complex was vacant. Demolition of the complex began in 1972 with a televised implosion of several of the buildings. Over the next four years, the rest of the complex was vacated and demolished.

In the aftermath of its demolition, Pruitt–Igoe became a symbol of the failings of the society-changing aspirations of modernist architecture, as the project&#x27;s problems were widely attributed to architectural flaws that created a hostile and unsafe environment. Critic Charles Jencks described its demolition as &quot;the day Modern architecture died&quot;. More recent appraisals have placed a greater emphasis on St. Louis&#x27;s precipitously declining population, and fiscal problems with the local housing authority. &quot;The Architectural Review&quot; states in a summary of the modern consensus that the project was &quot;doomed from the outset&quot;. , a large portion of the Pruitt–Igoe site remains vacant, although new development is pending.

== Description ==
Pruitt–Igoe consisted of 33 eleven-story concrete apartment buildings, clad in brick, on a site, on St. Louis&#x27;s north side, bounded by Cass Avenue on the north, North Jefferson Avenue on the west, Carr Street on the south, and North 20th Street on the east. Each building was long; most contained between 80 and 90 units, although some buildings had up to 150. The complex totaled 2,870 apartments (1,736 in Pruitt and 1,132 in Igoe) housing more than 10,000 people at full occupancy.

The apartments were deliberately small, with undersized kitchen appliances, and few units were designed for larger families. The apartments were not equipped with balconies. &quot;Skip-stop&quot; elevators stopped only at the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth &quot;anchor&quot; floors in an attempt to lessen elevator congestion, forcing many residents to use the stairs. The same anchor floors were equipped with large south-facing communal corridors called &quot;galleries&quot;, as well as laundry rooms and garbage chutes.

== History ==
=== Background ===
During the 1940s, the city of St. Louis was overcrowded, with housing conditions in some areas being said to resemble &quot;something out of a Charles Dickens novel&quot;. Its housing stock had deteriorated by the 1940s, and more than 85,000 families lived in 19th century tenements. An official survey from 1947 found that 33,000 homes had communal toilets. Middle-class, predominantly white, residents were leaving the city, and their former residences became occupied by low-income families. Black slums in the north and white slums in the south were expanding and threatening to engulf the city center. To save central properties from an imminent loss of value, city authorities settled on redevelopment of the inner ring around the central business district. Due to the state of decay, neighborhood gentrification never received serious consideration.

The first generation of St. Louis public housing was enabled by the Housing Act of 1937 and opened in 1942 as two identical but racially segregated low-rise developments: Carr Square in the northwest for African Americans, and Clinton Peabody in the southwest for whites. The projects, intended for the working poor rather than the truly destitute, were successful.

In 1947, St. Louis planners proposed to replace DeSoto-Carr, a run-down neighborhood with many black residents, with new two- and three-story residential blocks and a public park. The plan did not materialize; instead, Democratic mayor Joseph Darst, elected in 1949, and Republican state leaders favored clearing the slums and replacing them with high-rise, high-density public housing. They reasoned that the new projects would help the city through increased revenues, new parks, playgrounds and shopping space. Darst stated in 1951:

We must rebuild, open up and clean up the hearts of our cities. The fact that slums were created with all the intrinsic evils was everybody&#x27;s fault. Now it is everybody&#x27;s responsibility to repair the damage.

In 1948, voters rejected the proposal for a municipal loan to finance urban redevelopment, but soon the situation was changed with the Housing Act of 1949 and Missouri state laws that provided co-financing of public housing projects. The approach taken by Darst, urban renewal, was shared by President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s administration and fellow mayors of other cities overwhelmed by industrial workers recruited during the war. Specifically, the St. Louis Land Clearance and Redevelopment Authority was authorized to acquire and demolish the slums of the inner ring and then sell the land at reduced prices to private developers in the hopes of fostering middle-class development and luring families back from the suburbs. Another agency, the St. Louis Housing Authority, had to clear land to construct public housing for the former slum dwellers.

=== Design and construction ===
By 1950, St. Louis had received a federal commitment under the Housing Act of 1949 to finance 5,800 public housing units. The first large public housing in St. Louis, Cochran Gardens, was completed in 1953. It contained 704 units in a mix of medium- and high-rise buildings. It was followed by three more projects: Pruitt–Igoe, Vaughn, and Darst–Webbe. Pruitt–Igoe was named for St. Louisans Wendell O. Pruitt, an African-American fighter pilot in World War II, and William L. Igoe, a former US Congressman. Originally, the city planned two partitions: Pruitt for black residents and Igoe for whites, as St. Louis public housing was segregated until 1955.

In 1950, the city picked Leinweber, Yamasaki &amp; Hellmuth, an architectural firm based in St. Louis, to design the new public housing complex. The project was led by architect Minoru Yamasaki, then early in his career, and performed under supervision and constraints imposed by the federal authorities. His initial proposal, which included walk-up and mid-rise buildings as well as high-rises, was accepted by the St. Louis authorities, but exceeded the federal cost limits imposed by the Public Housing Administration; the agency intervened and imposed a uniform building height of 11 floors. Shortages of materials caused by the Korean War and tensions in the Congress further tightened federal controls. Overall density was set at a level of 50 units per acre, higher than in downtown slums. Although each row of buildings was supposed to be flanked by a &quot;river of open space&quot;, landscaping was omitted from the final plan and few trees were planted.

Construction began in 1951. Pruitt accepted its first tenants in November 1954, Igoe in July 1955. When the two projects opened, they were one of the largest public housing developments in the country. Even under federal cost-cutting regulations, Pruitt–Igoe initially cost $36 million, 60 percent above the national average for public housing; one factor was the installation of an expensive heating system. Despite the poor build quality, material suppliers cited Pruitt–Igoe in their advertisements to capitalize on the national exposure of the project.

=== Early years ===
Pruitt–Igoe was initially seen as a breakthrough in urban renewal. One early resident described her 11th floor apartment as a &quot;poor man&#x27;s penthouse&quot;. Pruitt–Igoe was officially desegregated by a Supreme Court decision in 1954, and as many as 40 percent of the initial tenants were white, but by the mid 1960s it had become exclusively African American.

=== Decline ===
By 1958, just four years after the opening of the project, deteriorating conditions were already evident. Elevator breakdowns and vandalism were cited as major problems—Yamasaki later lamented that he &quot;never thought people were that destructive&quot;. Ventilation was poor during St. Louis&#x27;s hot and humid summers. Meanwhile, the St. Louis Housing Authority was in the midst of a decades-long problem with inefficient and costly maintenance of its buildings, partly attributed to the power of labor unions. The stairwells and corridors attracted muggers, a situation exacerbated by the skip-stop elevators. Its location in &quot;a sea of decaying and abandoned buildings&quot; and limited access to shopping and recreation (ground-floor businesses had been eliminated from the design to save money, and the complex had no public mailbox) contributed to its problems. The huge, 11-story buildings of the development were reportedly a magnet for criminals and vagrants from the surrounding low-rise slums; a 1959 audit reported that most of the vandalism was done by transients rather than residents, and a 1967 report similarly found that a &quot;relatively large proportion&quot; of crimes were committed by outsiders. Large criminal gangs were not common in the project.

The Recession of 1958 led to increased crime, vacancy, and rent delinquency in the development, which cut into the housing authority&#x27;s revenue. In response, the authority reduced maintenance by 10 percent, and the reduction in maintenance coupled with a grand jury report that criticized crime levels in Pruitt–Igoe caused a significant drop in applications to the development. Increasing vacancy rates set off a feedback loop where the loss of revenue from rent forced the housing authority to curtail maintenance, further reducing the project&#x27;s desirability. Occupancy at both Pruitt and Igoe peaked in the first years, at 95 and 86 percent, respectively. In the 1960s, Pruitt remained about 75 percent full and Igoe 65 percent. In 1969, those numbers fell to 57.1 percent and 48.9 percent; at one point the vacancy rate was higher than any other public housing complex in the country. The annual turn-over rate was 20 percent.

After 1960, the rental income from Pruitt–Igoe failed to cover the cost of operation, forcing the housing authority to tap into its reserves and causing cutbacks at other developments, which were themselves profitable. Attempts by local authorities to improve living conditions were handicapped by lack of resources, though numerous programs, including the hiring of private security, rent incentives to attract new tenants, and grants for academic studies, were tried. As the financial position of the authority worsened, it raised the minimum rent from $20 a month in 1952, to $32 in 1958, $43 in 1962, and $58 in 1968. The increases forced some families to devote as much as 75 percent of their income to rent. In addition to the rent increases, tenants were charged for basic services like replacing fuses and door locks. The rent increases were a major factor in a nine-month rent strike by tenants in 1969. The strike began on February 2 at other public housing projects in the city and spread to Pruitt–Igoe by April 1. It ended with a settlement under which the board of commissioners of the housing authority resigned and tenant organizations were granted more influence.

In 1965, the project received a federal grant to improve the physical condition of the buildings and establish social programs for residents, but the grant failed to reverse the decline. Between 1963 and 1966 it was the subject of a sociological study by Lee Rainwater. In 1966, the Pruitt–Igoe Neighborhood Corporation commissioned a survey of the housing project that catalogued numerous issues with its maintenance, security, and management. Basic services like elevators and heating often failed, and maintenance sometimes took years to respond to tenant requests.

The withdrawal in 1967 of a private security force that patrolled the buildings led to a further escalation in crime and vandalism, which was partially attributed to the large number of juveniles in single-parent households; a census undertaken in September 1965 found that 69.2 percent of inhabitants were minors, and less than 30 percent of households with children had both parents present. Teenage pregnancy and juvenile delinquency were considered major problems by the residents. Families at Pruitt–Igoe were large: the average household had four minors. Nearly half of births (and 73 percent of first-born children) were out of wedlock, though this statistic was no higher in Pruitt–Igoe than in nearby private housing.

In spite of the widespread issues, most inhabitants of Pruitt–Igoe continued to live ordinary lives, and, according to Rainwater and activist Joan Miller, &quot;the vast majority... responded to their sick society in a healthy manner.&quot; 78 percent of residents reported that they were satisfied with their apartment, and 80 percent said that Pruitt–Igoe met their needs &quot;a little better&quot; or &quot;much better&quot; than their previous place of residence. The project contained isolated pockets of well-being throughout its worst years, and apartments clustered around small, two-family landings with tenants working to maintain and clear their common areas were often relatively successful.

=== Demolition ===
In 1968, the federal Department of Housing of Urban Development (HUD) began encouraging the remaining residents to leave Pruitt–Igoe. A 1970 report assessed the extent of the physical damage to the buildings as &quot;nearly unbelievable&quot; and far worse than in the other St. Louis projects. Many buildings had been practically ransacked, with broken windows and doors, walls stripped for wire and pipe, and garbage strewn about the site. Only 10 of the original 33 buildings were still occupied. In December 1971, state and federal authorities agreed to demolish two of the Pruitt–Igoe buildings. They hoped that a gradual reduction in population and building density could improve the situation; by this time, Pruitt–Igoe had consumed $57 million, an investment which they felt could not be wholly abandoned. Authorities considered different possibilities for rehabilitating Pruitt–Igoe, including conversion to a low-rise neighborhood by collapsing the towers down to a few floors to reduce the density. After 1971, most tenants were consolidated into the Igoe section. Despite the impending demolition, more than $1 million was spent on renovation in the 1970s, mainly funded by grants from the federal government.

After months of preparation, the first building was demolished with explosives on March 16, 1972. More buildings followed on April 21, June 9, and July 15. HUD announced in August 1973 their decision to demolish the rest of the complex. A last-minute attempt to purchase and rehabilitate a few of the buildings by a neighborhood community development corporation was rejected by HUD. The last tenant moved out in May 1974, and the project was fully cleared by 1976 at a total cost of $3.5million – becoming the first major housing projects in the United States to be demolished. Footage of the demolition was featured in the film &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;.

=== Site ===
Since Pruitt–Igoe&#x27;s demolition, various plans have been put forth for the use of its site, including a golf course, a business park, and a 50-story tower. An elementary school was built on part of the site in 1995, but a significant part of it remains vacant, even as adjacent lots have been redeveloped.

In 2020, Ponce Health Sciences University announced its intention to construct an $80 million facility on the site. When completed, the facility is planned to house the Ponce Health Sciences University School of Medicine in St. Louis. In 2021, a developer submitted zoning applications for the construction of office buildings and a hotel on the site. An urgent care center named after the former Homer G. Phillips Hospital was built in 2022, but restrictions related to the construction of a new headquarters for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency on an adjacent lot were reportedly stalling the redevelopment of the site.

== Legacy ==
Pruitt–Igoe has received extensive commentary in the architectural literature; architect William Ramroth describes it as &quot;the most infamous public housing disaster in American history&quot; and a &quot;poster child&quot; for the failures of public housing projects. Nonetheless, the initial reception of Pruitt–Igoe was positive, although contrary to popular belief the project never won any architectural awards. In 1951, before construction had finished, an &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; article lauded Yamasaki&#x27;s original proposal, praising the layout as &quot;vertical neighborhoods for poor people&quot;, and Yamasaki biographer Paul Kidder appraised it as &quot;an amazingly ambitious effort to turn the embarrassment of tenement squalor in a great American city into something decent and good&quot;.

Although Yamasaki&#x27;s design followed modernist conventions and was influenced by Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;ville radieuse&quot; concept, many design decisions were imposed by federal authorities, including vetoing the original proposal of a mix of structures of different heights. Even before the completion of the project, Yamasaki was skeptical that high-rise buildings would be beneficial to tenants, stating that &quot;The low building with low density is unquestionably more satisfactory than multi-story living.&quot; Nonetheless, he defended the high-rise design as a practical necessity for clearing slums.

Criticism of the project&#x27;s architectural design began in the 1960s. The skip-stop elevators forced many residents to use the stairwells, where muggings were frequent. The galleries, which were unpainted, unfurnished, and dimly-lit, served as hang-outs for criminal gangs rather than communal spaces. The landscaping intended to make Pruitt–Igoe &quot;towers in the park&quot; was cut from the final plan, and the surrounding area subsequently turned to wasteland. In addition to the architectural flaws, the overall quality of construction was extremely poor: the buildings were described by housing researcher Eugene Meehan as &quot;little more than steel and concrete rabbit warrens, poorly designed, badly equipped, inadequate in size, badly located, unventilated, and virtually impossible to maintain&quot;.

After the demolition of the first buildings in 1972, Pruitt–Igoe received wider attention and began to be perceived as a failure of modernist architecture as a whole. By the late 1970s, this view had coalesced into &quot;architectural dogma&quot;, especially for the nascent movements of postmodern architecture and environment and behavior architecture. Postmodern architectural historian Charles Jencks called its destruction &quot;the day Modern architecture died&quot; and considered it a direct indictment of the society-changing aspirations of the International school of architecture and an example of modernists&#x27; intentions running contrary to real-world social development.

Pruitt–Igoe served as a case study for Oscar Newman&#x27;s concept of defensible space, in which structures are laid out so that residents have control and responsibility over their surroundings. Newman criticized the large spaces shared by dozens of families as &quot;anonymous public spaces [that] made it impossible for even neighboring residents to develop an accord about acceptable behavior&quot;, and attributed Pruitt–Igoe&#x27;s social problems to its high-rise design and lack of defensible space, contrasting it unfavorably with the adjacent Carr Village, a low-rise area with a similar demographic makeup that remained fully occupied and largely trouble-free in the same period. Newman&#x27;s analysis was one of the most influential in attributing the project&#x27;s failure to &quot;environmentally determined architecture&quot;.

Other critics argue that the Pruitt–Igoe&#x27;s architecture has been overemphasized compared to political and social factors, a view prominently advanced by Katharine Bristol (at the time a doctoral student in architecture) in a 1991 article titled &quot;The Pruitt–Igoe Myth&quot;. While acknowledging flaws in the project&#x27;s design, Bristol cited the underfunding of public housing and consequent inability for the housing authority to properly maintain the buildings and the deleterious effects of poverty and racial discrimination on its residents as crucial factors in Pruitt–Igoe&#x27;s decline. The steep fall in St. Louis&#x27;s population exacerbated the project&#x27;s vacancy problem—instead of growing from 850,000 in the 1940s to 1 million in 1970 as projected, the city lost 30 percent of its residents in that timespan due to suburbanization and white flight, as well as 11,000 manufacturing jobs in an overall shift from a blue collar to white collar economy. &quot;The Pruitt-Igoe Myth&quot;, a 2011 documentary film, largely followed Bristol&#x27;s view.

In his book-length study of St. Louis public housing policy, Eugene Meehan assessed the root cause as &quot;a set of policies programmed for failure&quot;, in particular the requirement of the Housing Act of 1949 that local housing authorities pay their expenses from rental income, which made them vulnerable to fiscal problems. The &quot;mindless concentration on dollar costs&quot; and &quot;voracious and inefficient&quot; local construction industry also contributed to the project&#x27;s maintenance woes. Widespread voter opposition to public housing, both locally and nationally, created a &quot;hostile climate&quot; that limited financial assistance from the government; in turn, the eventual failure of the project contributed to the further unpopularity of public housing, both locally and nationally. According to &quot;The Architectural Review&quot;, the modern consensus is that the underfunded project was &quot;doomed from the outset&quot;.

The failure and demolition of Pruitt–Igoe damaged Yamasaki&#x27;s reputation as an architect, and he personally regretted designing the buildings.

<text>In numerical integration, Simpson&#x27;s rules are several approximations for definite integrals, named after Thomas Simpson (1710–1761).

The most basic of these rules, called Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule, or just Simpson&#x27;s rule, reads
formula_1

In German and some other languages, it is named after Johannes Kepler, who derived it in 1615 after seeing it used for wine barrels (barrel rule, ). The approximate equality in the rule becomes exact if is a polynomial up to and including 3rd degree.

If the 1/3 rule is applied to &quot;n&quot; equal subdivisions of the integration range [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], one obtains the [[Simpson&#x27;s rule|composite Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule]]. Points inside the integration range are given alternating weights 4/3 and 2/3.

[[Simpson&#x27;s rule|Simpson&#x27;s 3/8 rule]], also called Simpson&#x27;s second rule, requires one more function evaluation inside the integration range and gives lower error bounds, but does not improve the order of the error.

If the 3/8 rule is applied to &quot;n&quot; equal subdivisions of the integration range [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], one obtains the [[Simpson&#x27;s rule|composite Simpson&#x27;s 3/8 rule]].

Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 and 3/8 rules are two special cases of closed Newton–Cotes formulas.

In naval architecture and ship stability estimation, there also exists &quot;Simpson&#x27;s third rule&quot;, which has no special importance in general numerical analysis, see Simpson&#x27;s rules (ship stability).

== Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule ==
Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule, also simply called Simpson&#x27;s rule, is a method for numerical integration proposed by Thomas Simpson. It is based upon a quadratic interpolation and is the composite Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule evaluated for formula_2. Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule is as follows:
formula_3
where formula_4 is the step size for formula_2.

The error in approximating an integral by Simpson&#x27;s rule for formula_2 is
formula_7
where formula_8 (the Greek letter xi) is some number between formula_9 and formula_10.

The error is asymptotically proportional to formula_11. However, the above derivations suggest an error proportional to formula_12. Simpson&#x27;s rule gains an extra order because the points at which the integrand is evaluated are distributed symmetrically in the interval formula_13.

Since the error term is proportional to the fourth derivative of formula_14 at formula_8, this shows that Simpson&#x27;s rule provides exact results for any polynomial formula_14 of degree three or less, since the fourth derivative of such a polynomial is zero at all points. Another way to see this result is to note that any interpolating cubic polynomial can be expressed as the sum of the unique interpolating quadratic polynomial plus an arbitrarily scaled cubic polynomial that vanishes at all three points in the interval, and the integral of this second term vanishes because it is odd within the interval.

If the second derivative formula_17 exists and is convex in the interval formula_18, then
formula_19

=== Derivations ===
==== Quadratic interpolation ====
One derivation replaces the integrand formula_20 by the quadratic polynomial (i.e. parabola) formula_21 that takes the same values as formula_20 at the end points formula_9 and formula_10 and the midpoint formula_25, where formula_26. One can use Lagrange polynomial interpolation to find an expression for this polynomial,
formula_27

By making the substitution formula_28, one can calculate:

formula_29

Because of the formula_30 factor, Simpson&#x27;s rule is also referred to as &quot;Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule&quot; (see below for generalization).

==== Averaging the midpoint and the trapezoidal rules ====
Another derivation constructs Simpson&#x27;s rule from two simpler approximations: the midpoint rule
formula_31
and the trapezoidal rule
formula_32

The errors in these approximations are
formula_33
and
formula_34
respectively, where formula_35 denotes a term asymptotically proportional to formula_12. The two formula_35 terms are not equal; see Big O notation for more details. It follows from the above formulas for the errors of the midpoint and trapezoidal rule that the leading error term vanishes if we take the weighted average
formula_38
This weighted average is exactly Simpson&#x27;s rule.

Using another approximation (for example, the trapezoidal rule with twice as many points), it is possible to take a suitable weighted average and eliminate another error term. This is Romberg&#x27;s method.

==== Undetermined coefficients ====
The third derivation starts from the &quot;ansatz&quot;
formula_39

The coefficients , and can be fixed by requiring that this approximation be exact for all quadratic polynomials. This yields Simpson&#x27;s rule. (This derivation is essentially a less rigorous version of the quadratic interpolation derivation, where one saves significant calculation effort by guessing the correct functional form.)

=== Composite Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule ===
If the interval of integration formula_40 is in some sense &quot;small&quot;, then Simpson&#x27;s rule with formula_2 subintervals will provide an adequate approximation to the exact integral. By &quot;small&quot; we mean that the function being integrated is relatively smooth over the interval formula_40. For such a function, a smooth quadratic interpolant like the one used in Simpson&#x27;s rule will give good results.

However, it is often the case that the function we are trying to integrate is not smooth over the interval. Typically, this means that either the function is highly oscillatory or lacks derivatives at certain points. In these cases, Simpson&#x27;s rule may give very poor results. One common way of handling this problem is by breaking up the interval formula_40 into formula_44 small subintervals. Simpson&#x27;s rule is then applied to each subinterval, with the results being summed to produce an approximation for the integral over the entire interval. This sort of approach is termed the &quot;composite Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule&quot;, or just &quot;composite Simpson&#x27;s rule&quot;.

Suppose that the interval formula_40 is split up into formula_46 subintervals, with formula_46 an even number. Then, the composite Simpson&#x27;s rule is given by

Dividing the interval formula_40 into formula_46 subintervals of length formula_4 and introducing the points formula_51 for formula_52 (in particular, formula_53 and formula_54), we have
formula_55
This composite rule with formula_2 corresponds with the regular Simpson&#x27;s rule of the preceding section.

The error committed by the composite Simpson&#x27;s rule is
formula_57
where formula_8 is some number between formula_9 and formula_10, and formula_4 is the &quot;step length&quot;. The error is bounded (in absolute value) by
formula_62

This formulation splits the interval formula_40 in subintervals of equal length. In practice, it is often advantageous to use subintervals of different lengths and concentrate the efforts on the places where the integrand is less well-behaved. This leads to the adaptive Simpson&#x27;s method.

== Simpson&#x27;s 3/8 rule ==
Simpson&#x27;s 3/8 rule, also called Simpson&#x27;s second rule, is another method for numerical integration proposed by Thomas Simpson. It is based upon a cubic interpolation rather than a quadratic interpolation. Simpson&#x27;s 3/8 rule is as follows:
formula_64
where formula_65 is the step size.

The error of this method is
formula_66
where formula_8 is some number between formula_9 and formula_10. Thus, the 3/8 rule is about twice as accurate as the standard method, but it uses one more function value. A composite 3/8 rule also exists, similarly as above.

A further generalization of this concept for interpolation with arbitrary-degree polynomials are the Newton–Cotes formulas.

=== Composite Simpson&#x27;s 3/8 rule ===
Dividing the interval formula_40 into formula_46 subintervals of length formula_4 and introducing the points formula_51 for formula_52 (in particular, formula_53 and formula_54), we have
formula_77

While the remainder for the rule is shown as
formula_78
we can only use this if formula_46 is a multiple of three. The 1/3 rule can be used for the remaining subintervals without changing the order of the error term (conversely, the 3/8 rule can be used with a composite 1/3 rule for odd-numbered subintervals).

== Alternative extended Simpson&#x27;s rule ==
This is another formulation of a composite Simpson&#x27;s rule: instead of applying Simpson&#x27;s rule to disjoint segments of the integral to be approximated, Simpson&#x27;s rule is applied to overlapping segments, yielding
formula_80

The formula above is obtained by combining the composite Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule with the one consisting of using Simpson&#x27;s 3/8 rule in the extreme subintervals and Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule in the remaining subintervals. The result is then obtained by taking the mean of the two formulas.

=== Simpson&#x27;s rules in the case of narrow peaks ===
In the task of estimation of full area of narrow peak-like functions, Simpson&#x27;s rules are much less efficient than trapezoidal rule. Namely, composite Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule requires 1.8 times more points to achieve the same accuracy as trapezoidal rule. Composite Simpson&#x27;s 3/8 rule is even less accurate. Integration by Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule can be represented as a weighted average with 2/3 of the value coming from integration by the trapezoidal rule with step &quot;h&quot; and 1/3 of the value coming from integration by the rectangle rule with step 2&quot;h&quot;. The accuracy is governed by the second (2&quot;h&quot; step) term. Averaging of Simpson&#x27;s 1/3 rule composite sums with properly shifted frames produces the following rules:
formula_81
where two points outside of the integrated region are exploited, and 
formula_82
where only points within integration region are used. Application of the second rule to the region of 3 points generates 1/3 Simpson&#x27;s rule, 4 points - 3/8 rule.

These rules are very much similar to the alternative extended Simpson&#x27;s rule. The coefficients within the major part of the region being integrated are one with non-unit coefficients only at the edges. These two rules can be associated with Euler–MacLaurin formula with the first derivative term and named First order Euler–MacLaurin integration rules. The two rules presented above differ only in the way how the first derivative at the region end is calculated. The first derivative term in the Euler–MacLaurin integration rules accounts for integral of the second derivative, which equals the difference of the first derivatives at the edges of the integration region. It is possible to generate higher order Euler–Maclaurin rules by adding a difference of 3rd, 5th, and so on derivatives with coefficients, as defined by Euler–MacLaurin formula.

== Composite Simpson&#x27;s rule for irregularly spaced data ==
For some applications, the integration interval formula_83 needs to be divided into uneven intervals – perhaps due to uneven sampling of data, or missing or corrupted data points. Suppose we divide the interval formula_84 into an even number formula_85 of subintervals of widths formula_86. Then the composite Simpson&#x27;s rule is given by
formula_87
where
formula_88
are the function values at the formula_89th sampling point on the interval formula_84.

In case of an odd number formula_85 of subintervals, the above formula is used up to the second to last interval, 
and the last interval is handled separately by adding the following to the result:
formula_92
where
formula_93

<doc id="219965" wikidata="Q44784" url="?curid=219965" title="Manzai">
<text>is a traditional style of comedy in Japanese culture comparable to double act comedy.

 usually involves two performers ()—a straight man () and a funny man ()—trading jokes at great speed. Most of the jokes revolve around mutual misunderstandings, double-talk, puns and other verbal gags.

In recent times, has often been associated with the Osaka region, and comedians often speak in the Kansai dialect during their acts.

In 1933, Yoshimoto Kogyo, a large entertainment conglomerate based in Osaka, introduced Osaka-style to Tokyo audiences and coined the term &quot;&quot; (one of several ways of writing the word in Japanese; see below). In 2015, Matayoshi Naoki&#x27;s manzai novel, , won the Akutagawa Prize. A was released on Netflix in 2016.

==History==
Originally based around a festival to welcome the New Year, traces its origins back to the Heian period. The two performers came with messages from the &quot;kami&quot; and this was worked into a standup routine, with one performer showing some sort of opposition to the word of the other. This pattern still exists in the roles of the and the .

Continuing into the Edo period, the style focused increasingly on the humor aspects of stand-up, and various regions of Japan developed their own unique styles of , such as , , and . With the arrival of the Meiji period, began to implement changes that would see it surpass in popularity the styles of the former period, although at the time was still considered the more popular form of entertainment.

With the end of the Taishō period, Yoshimoto Kōgyō—which itself was founded at the beginning of the era, in 1912—introduced a new style of lacking much of the celebration that had accompanied it in the past. This new style proved successful and spread all over Japan, including Tokyo. Riding on the waves of new communication technology, quickly spread through the mediums of stage, radio, and eventually, television, and video games.

==Etymology==
The kanji for have been written in various ways throughout the ages. It was originally written as , using rather than the alternative form of the character, , and the simpler form for (which also can be used to write a word meaning &quot;talent, ability&quot;). The arrival of brought another character change, this time changing the first character to .

== and ==
Similar in execution to the concepts of &quot;funny man&quot; and &quot;straight man&quot; in double act comedy (e.g. Abbott and Costello), these roles are a very important characteristic of . comes from the verb which carries the meaning of &quot;senility&quot; or &quot;air headed-ness&quot; and is reflected in the &#x27;s tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. The word refers to the role the second comedian plays in &quot;butting in&quot; and correcting the &#x27;s errors. In performances it is common for the to berate the and hit them on the head with a swift smack; one traditional prop often used for this purpose is a pleated paper fan called a . Another traditional prop is a small drum, usually carried (and used) by the . A Japanese bamboo and paper umbrella is another common prop. These props are usually used only during non-serious routines as traditional requires there to be no props in terms of routine and in competitions. The use of props would put the comedy act closer to a &quot;conte&quot; rather than &quot;manzai&quot;.

The tradition of and is often used in other Japanese comedy, although it may not be as obviously portrayed as it usually is in .

<text>John G. Hayes, Sr. (July 17, 1919 – December 8, 1998), was a harness racing driver, trainer, and owner who was inducted into the Canadian and American harness racing halls of fame.

Born in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, Hayes was the son of a dairy farmer, and went on to become a prominent figure in harness racing and the first Canadian to be selected to the Little Brown Jug&#x27;s Wall of Fame. His greatest accomplishment was in training horses in particular when he developed the great champion, Strike Out.

A longtime director of the Canadian Trotting Association, for ten years Hayes served as its president. Hayes was also vice-chairman of the Ontario Racing Commission.

It had been Hayes&#x27; lifelong dream to win the Little Brown Jug, and was famous for having told a newspaper reporter: &quot;I&#x27;d rather win the Little Brown Jug than go to heaven.&quot; When he died in 1998, the Little Brown Jug itself, won by Strike Out in 1972, was placed at the head of his casket.

John Hayes was inducted into the Little Brown Jug Wall of Fame in 1990, the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1991, and the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Beejay Stable== 
The Beejay Stable was a harness racing stable and breeding business owned by John Hayes as managing partner in a partnership formed in 1959 with Montreal&#x27;s Shapiro brothers, Conrad, Leo, and Robert. Among the horses owned by the partnership were Sharp &#x27;n&#x27; Smart, Penn Hanover, Keystone Pat, Alley Fighter, and their most successful, the hall-of-fame pacer, Strike Out. Twenty-five years after the partnership was first formed, they established the Quarter Century Club as a vehicle for investments in various racing stock such as a share in sire Albatross and businesses including Castleton Farm and the Tattersalls Sales Company in Lexington, Kentucky.

<text>The Little Brown Jug is a harness race for three-year-old pacing standardbred horses hosted by the Delaware County Agricultural Society since 1946 at the Delaware County Fairgrounds racetrack in Delaware, Ohio. The race takes place every year on the third Thursday after Labor Day.

Along with the Hambletonian, a race for trotters, it is one of the two most coveted races for standardbreds. The event is named after Little Brown Jug, a pacer, who won nine consecutive races and became a USTA Hall of Fame Immortal in 1975.

The race is the counterpart to the Jugette for three-year-old fillies.

==History==
It began in 1937 when the Delaware County Agricultural Society&#x27;s members, at their annual meeting, voted to move the County Fair, held since its inception at Powell, to Delaware on a tract of land at the northern edge of the city. Two years later a half-mile track was built and provided the stage for harness racing. R.K. McNamara, a local contractor, designed and built the lightning fast track. Enter attorney Joe Neville, whose family had been identified with the standardbred sport for many years, and his friend, Henry C. &quot;Hank&quot; Thomson, sports editor of &quot;The Delaware Gazette&quot;. Neville, who had campaigned horses on the Grand Circuit and was familiar with its officers and stewards, was successful in obtaining Grand Circuit dates for the new Delaware track. Neville, concerned over the years by the emphasis placed on the trotter, turned his efforts toward showcasing the pacers, particularly the 3-year-olds. The Little Brown Jug Society was formed to stage the Grand Circuit meeting. Neville headed the organization with Thomson as secretary-treasurer. Then came the birth of the Little Brown Jug, named through a newspaper contest won by Major Lanning Parsons, with its previews in 1944 and 1945. The initial Jug in 1946, with a purse of $35,358, was won by Ensign Hanover with Delaware&#x27;s Wayne &quot;Curly&quot; Smart driving. Smart, a successful trainer-driver on the Grand Circuit, was later to become an integral part of the Jug&#x27;s operation as the track superintendent. Over the years the track monopolized the half-mile record section with world standard performances, mainly through Smart&#x27;s skill in maintaining the fastest racing strip of its size in the country.

Through its humble beginnings, the Jug grew slowly to become perhaps the most traditional stake on the pacing gait. In 1956 the Jug provided the anchor for the newly designated Triple Crown of Pacing to go along with the Cane Pace (currently held at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey) and the Messenger Stakes (currently held at Yonkers Raceway in Yonkers, New York).

In 2023, the total purse of the race (including the purses of the heats) was increased to $1,000,000 for the first time.

===Race Structure===
The Little Brown Jug is contested in heats. Up until 2016, a horse had to win 2 heats in order to be crowned the winner of the Little Brown Jug. The first heat is split into several divisions, with the top finishers in each division returning to contest the second heat. A horse wins the Little Brown Jug by winning both heats. If a horse does not win both heats, a race off is conducted between the first heat division winners, and the winner of the second heat, to determine the champion. Starting in 2017, the first heat is still split into several divisions (usually 2, sometimes 3) and the top finishers in each division still return to the second heat - however the winner of the second heat is now considered the winner of the Little Brown Jug regardless of if the horse won a division in the first heat. 

Ever since 1946 the administrators of the Little Brown Jug have glazed the winners of the horse race on a jug. In 2005, they ran out of room on the first jug and had to make another one. This time, instead of making it out of clay, they made it out of plastic so it would be lighter.

==Records==
; Most wins by a driver:
* 5 – Billy Haughton (1955, 1964, 1968, 1969, 1974) 
* 5 – Michel Lachance (1988, 1989, 1994, 1997, 2001)

<text>Poti ( ; Mingrelian: ფუთი; Laz: ჶაში/Faşi or ფაში/Paşi) is a port city in Georgia, located on the eastern Black Sea coast in the region of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti in the west of the country. Built near the site of the ancient Greek colony of Phasis and deriving its name from the same, the city has become a major port city and industrial center since the early 20th century. It is also home to a main naval base and the headquarters of the Georgian Navy.

==Etymology==
The name Poti is linked to Phasis, but the etymology is a matter of a scholarly dispute. &quot;Phasis&quot; () is first recorded in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; (c. 700 BC) as a name of the river, not a town. Since Erich Diehl, 1938, first suggested a non-Hellenic origin of the name and asserted that Phasis might have been a derivative of a local hydronym, several explanations have been proposed, linking the name to the Proto-Georgian-Zan &quot;*Poti&quot;, Svan &quot;*Pasid&quot;, and even to a Semitic word, meaning &quot;a gold river&quot;.

== History ==
===Ancient and medieval history===

The recorded history of Poti and its environments spans over 26 centuries. In Classical antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the area was occupied by the Greek polis of Phasis which was established by the colonists from Miletus led by one Themistagoras at the very end of the 7th, and probably at the beginning of the 6th century BC. The famed Greek semi-mythological voyage of Jason and the Argonauts in search of the Golden Fleece would have entered Georgia at this port and traveled up the river to what is today Kutaisi.

After many years of uncertainty and academic debate, the site of this settlement now seems to be established, thanks to underwater archaeology under tough conditions. Apparently, the lake which the well-informed Ancient Greek author Strabo reported as bounding one side of Phasis has now engulfed it, or part of it. Yet, a series of questions regarding the town’s exact location and identification of its ruins remain open due largely to the centuries-long geomorphological processes of the area as the lower reaches of the Rioni are prone to changes of course across the wetland. Phasis appears to have been an important center of trade and culture in Colchis throughout the Classical period. The section along the river Phasis was a vital component of the presumed trade route from India to the Black Sea, attested by Strabo and Pliny.

Between the 6th and 2nd centuries BC, the town played an active role in these contacts. During the Third Mithridatic War, Phasis came under Roman control. It was where the Roman commander-in-chief Pompey, having crossed into Colchis from Iberia, met the legate Servilius, the admiral of his Euxine fleet in 65 BC. After the introduction of Christianity, Phasis was a seat of a Greek diocese, one of whose bishops, Cyrus, became a Patriarch of Alexandria between 630 and 641 AD. During the Lazic War between the Eastern Roman and Sassanid Iranian empires (542-562), Phasis was attacked, unsuccessfully, by Iranian soldiers.

In the 8th century, the name Poti entered Georgian written sources. It remained a place of maritime trade within the Kingdom of Georgia and was known to medieval European travelers as Fasso. In the 14th century, the Genoese established a trading factory, which proved to be short-lived.

=== Modern history ===
In 1578, Poti was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The Turks, who knew the town as Faş, heavily fortified it and made it into one of their Caucasian outposts which were also home to a great slave market. A combined army of the western Georgian princes recovered Poti in 1640, but the town fell under the Ottoman sway again in 1723. Another futile attempt to dispossess the Ottomans of Poti was made by Russo-Georgian forces in 1770 and 1771. Once Russia took control of most of the principal Georgian lands in the 1800s, it again attempted to evict the Turkish garrison from Poti and succeeded in doing so with the help of Georgian auxiliaries under the command of Nino, Princess of Mingrelia in 1809, but was coerced to return the fortress to the Ottomans in the Treaty of Bucharest (1812). The next Russo-Turkish War resulted in the capture of Poti by Russia in 1828. (See Russian conquest of the Caucasus#Black Sea Coast.) The town was subordinated to the Governorate of Kutais and granted the status of a port town in 1858. The seaport was reconstructed between 1863 and 1905. In 1872, the town became the terminus of the Transcaucasus Railway, whence the line led directly to Tiflis (Tbilisi).
Poti particularly grew in size and importance during the mayorship of Niko Nikoladze between 1894 and 1912. Considered to be the founding father of modern Poti, Nikoladze presided over a series of modernizing and construction projects, including a theater, a large cathedral, two gymnasia, a power station, an oil refinery, etc. By 1900, Poti had become one of the major ports on the Black Sea, exporting most of Georgia’s manganese and coal. During the First Russian Revolution, Poti became a scene of workers&#x27; strikes and barricade fighting in December 1905. At the beginning of World War I, on November 7, 1914, the Ottoman SMS &quot;Breslau&quot; appeared off the port of Poti and subjected the railway yards there to a bombardment that lasted three-quarters of an hour, without any direct results.

During a brief period of independence in 1918–1921, Poti was Georgia’s principal window to Europe, also serving as the portal of entry for successive German and British expeditionary forces. On May 28, 1918, a German-Georgian preliminary treaty of alliance was signed at Poti. On March 14, 1921, Poti was occupied by the invading Red Armies of Soviet Russia which installed a Soviet government in Georgia. During the Soviet era, Poti retained its principal function as a seaport and the town was further industrialized and militarized.

During the 2008 war with Russia, Russian warplanes attacked the port. Although a ceasefire was declared on August 12, the Russian troops continued to occupy the environs of the city until being withdrawn the next month.

==Politics==

Poti City Assembly (Georgian: ფოთის საკრებულო) is the representative body in Poti City, consisting of 35 members, which is elected every four years. The last election was held in October 2021. Beka Vacharadze of Georgian Dream was elected mayor through the 2nd round against a candidate of the United National Movement.

== Geography and climate ==
Poti is situated west of Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi, in a marshy delta created by the major river of western Georgia, the Rioni, at its entrance into the Black Sea. The city lies at an altitude of above sea level. A portion of Poti&#x27;s environs recovered from the marshes now accommodate citrus plantation. The city is surrounded by the Kolkheti National Park. It is flanked by the small river Kaparchina to the south-east and Lake Paliastomi to the south-west. Some to the south is the village Maltaqva, a local beach resort. 

The city&#x27;s climate is humid subtropical (Köppen:&quot;Cfa&quot;, Trewartha:&quot;Cf&quot;) with cool winters and hot summers. Average annual precipitation is , with the highest recorded value of daily precipitation being on 23 June 2008. Only in 2.6 days per year snow cover is observed.

Highest recorded temperature: on 30 July 2000


== Economy ==

The service and food industries represent the most important sectors of the economy. The Poti Sea Port (7.7 million tons per annum) is operational. The railway to Tbilisi makes this a more useful port than the natural harbor at Batumi.

In April 2008, Georgia sold a 51% stake of the Poti port to the Investment Authority of the UAE’s Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) emirate to develop a free industrial zone (FIZ) in a 49-year management concession, and to manage a new port terminal. The creation of a new FEZ was officially inaugurated by the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili on April 15, 2008.

As of November 2009, there were plans for a Kerch–Poti ferry route.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s main football team is Kolkheti 1913 Poti who play at the multi-use Fazisi Stadium.

== Fiber optic network ==
A long haul submarine communications cable - Bulgaria–Georgia communications cable - stretching from Varna, Bulgaria across the Black Sea to Poti Georgia was laid during the month of July 2008 onboard the American cable ship CS &quot;Tyco Decisive&quot;, just a couple of weeks prior to the Russo-Georgian War. This cable system will be Georgia&#x27;s first privately owned fiber-optic system for the citizens of Georgia. Instead of paying high prices for internet/TV/phone usage through Turkey, Georgians will now be able to pay much less for their own private high-speed fiber optic cable internet cable system usage.

== Military ==

The Poti naval base was organized by the Soviet government in July 1941, a month after the German invasion during World War II. Commanded by Major-General Mikhail Kumanin, the base operated as a part of the Black Sea Fleet and included two submarine divisions, a torpedo boat division, coastal guard boat division, two minesweepers, four coastal and six missile batteries, etc. After the German capture of Sevastopol and Novorossiysk in 1942, several destroyers were transferred to be based at Poti which, together with another Georgian port city, Batumi, functioned as a secondary harbor in the Black Sea Campaigns (1941–44). By the early 1990s, the Poti base had accommodated several smaller units of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, but became essentially defunct after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In December 1992, Russia withdrew all its vessels and ammunition from the Poti naval base, but an ethnic Georgian commander of one landing ship refused to obey Moscow’s order and displayed a Georgian flag. At almost the same time, the Georgian government created a Joint Naval Brigade, consisting of several boats, a battalion of marines, an artillery division, and a communication detachment. Since then, the Brigade has been enlarged and reequipped with the help of the NATO-member states.

On October 9, 1993, a war-torn Georgia had to legalize the Russian military presence in the country, and lease, among other military facilities, the Poti base to the Russian navy. However, Georgia continued, though fruitlessly, to claim the vessels formerly stationed at Poti as a part of a tripartite Russo-Ukrainian-Georgian dispute over the Soviet Black Sea Fleet shares. By September 1998, the Russian military personnel had been withdrawn from Poti to the Russian base at Batumi under a Russo-Georgian agreement signed earlier that year.

Currently, Poti is a military facility assignment to several of Georgia’s units. These are the headquarters and main base of the Georgian navy, a primary naval logistic support base, a station of a naval squadron, and barracks for a separate light infantry battalion of the Georgian Armed Forces.

<text>Iwi () are the largest social units in New Zealand Māori society. In Māori, roughly means or , and is often translated as &quot;tribe&quot;. The word is both singular and plural in the Māori language, and is typically pluralised as such in English.

 groups trace their ancestry to the original Polynesian migrants who, according to tradition, arrived from Hawaiki. Some cluster into larger groupings that are based on (genealogical tradition) and known as (literally , with reference to the original migration voyages). These super-groupings are generally symbolic rather than logistical. In pre-European times, most Māori were allied to relatively small groups in the form of () and (). Each contains a number of ; among the of the Ngāti Whātua iwi, for example, are Te Uri-o-Hau, Te Roroa, Te Taoū, and Ngāti Whātua-o-Ōrākei. Māori use the word &quot;rohe&quot; for the territory or boundaries of iwi.

In modern-day New Zealand, can exercise significant political power in the management of land and other assets. For example, the 1997 Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the New Zealand Government and Ngāi Tahu compensated that for various losses of the rights guaranteed under the Treaty of Waitangi of 1840. the tribe has collective assets under management of $1.85 billion. affairs can have a real impact on New Zealand politics and society. A 2004 attempt by some to test in court their ownership of the seabed and foreshore areas polarised public opinion (see New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy).

== Naming ==
In Māori and many other Polynesian languages, literally means , derived from Proto-Oceanic *&quot;suRi&quot;₁, meaning . Māori may refer to returning home after travelling or living elsewhere as &quot;going back to the bones&quot; – literally to the burial areas of the ancestors. Māori author Keri Hulme&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bone People&quot; (1985) has a title linked directly to the dual meaning of bone and &quot;tribal people&quot;.

Many names begin with or with (from and respectively, both meaning roughly ). has become a productive morpheme in New Zealand English to refer to groups of people: examples are Ngāti Pākehā (Pākehā as a group), Ngāti Poneke (Māori who have migrated to the Wellington region), and Ngāti Rānana (Māori living in London). Ngāti Tūmatauenga (&quot;Tribe of Tūmatauenga&quot;, the god of war) is the official Māori-language name of the New Zealand Army.

In the southern dialect of Māori, Ngāti and Ngāi become and , terms found in such iwi names as Kāti Māmoe and Kāi Tahu (also known as Ngāi Tahu).

== Structure ==
Each has a generally recognised territory (), but many of these overlap, sometimes completely. This has added a layer of complication to the long-running discussions and court cases about how to resolve historical Treaty claims. The length of coastline emerged as one factor in the final (2004) legislation to allocate fishing-rights in settlement of claims relating to commercial fisheries.

=== Self-determination ===
 can become a prospective vehicle for ideas and ideals of self-determination and/or . Thus does Te Pāti Māori mention in the preamble of its constitution &quot;the dreams and aspirations of to achieve self-determination for , and within their own land&quot;. Some Tūhoe envisage self-determination in specifically -oriented terms.

===Iwi identity===
Increasing urbanisation of Māori has led to a situation where a significant percentage do not identify with any particular . The following extract from a 2000 High Court of New Zealand judgment discussing the process of settling fishing rights illustrates some of the issues:
... 81 per cent of Maori now live in urban areas, at least one-third live outside their tribal influence, more than one-quarter do not know their iwi or for some reason do not choose to affiliate with it, at least 70 per cent live outside the traditional tribal territory and these will have difficulties, which in many cases will be severe, in both relating to their tribal heritage and in accessing benefits from the settlement. It is also said that many Maori reject tribal affiliation because of a working-class unemployed attitude, defiance and frustration. Related but less important factors, are that a hapu may belong to more than one iwi, a particular hapu may have belonged to different iwi at different times, the tension caused by the social and economic power moving from the iwi down rather than from the hapu up, and the fact that many iwi do not recognise spouses and adoptees who do not have kinship links.
In the 2006 census, 16 per cent of the 643,977 people who claimed Māori ancestry did not know their . Another 11 per cent did not state their , or stated only a general geographic region, or merely gave a name. Initiatives like the Iwi Helpline are trying to make it easier for people to identify their , and the proportion who &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot; dropped relative to previous censuses.

===Pan-tribalism===
Some established pan-tribal organisations may exert influence across divisions. The Rātana Church, for example, operates across divisions, and the Māori King Movement, though principally congregated around Waikato/Tainui, aims to transcend some functions in a wider grouping.

==Iwi radio==

Many operate or are affiliated with media organisations. Most of these belong to (the National Māori Radio Network), a group of radio stations which receive contestable Government funding from Te Māngai Pāho (the Māori Broadcast Funding Agency) to operate on behalf of and . Under their funding agreement, the stations must produce programmes in the local Māori language and actively promote local Māori culture.

A two-year Massey University survey of 30,000 people published in 2003 indicated 50 per cent of Māori in National Māori Radio Network broadcast areas listened to an station. An Auckland University of Technology study in 2009 suggested the audience of radio stations would increase as the growing New Zealand Māori population tried to keep a connection to their culture, family history, spirituality, community, language and .

The Victoria University of Wellington Te Reo Māori Society campaigned for Māori radio, helping to set up Te Reo o Poneke, the first Māori-owned radio operation, using airtime on Wellington student-radio station Radio Active in 1983. Twenty-one radio stations were set up between 1989 and 1994, receiving Government funding in accordance with a Treaty of Waitangi claim. This group of radio stations formed various networks, becoming .

<text>Seljuk (died or 1009), variously romanized, was an Oghuz Turk warlord. He was the eponymous founder of the Seljuk dynasty and the namesake of Selçuk, the modern town near the ruins of ancient Ephesus in Turkey.

== Name ==
The warlord&#x27;s personal name is Selçuk () in modern Turkish, a name sometimes anglicized to Selcuk. His name varies in different sources and languages. The form (&quot;Selcuk&quot; or &quot;Selcük&quot;, or ) appears in Mahmud al-Kashgari&#x27;s 10721074 Karakhanid Turkish &quot;Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk&quot; and in the anonymous 13th15th-century Old Anatolian Turkish &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;. It appears in Arabic and Persian sources as , , , , and . Romanizations include Seljuk ( or ), Seljuq, Selcük, Seldjuk, Seldjuq, and Saljūq. His name is sometimes given the title bey, also variously romanized.

There are different theories about the etymology of Seljuk:
* &quot;selçük&quot;, meaning &quot;small flood&quot;
* &quot;salçuk&quot;, meaning &quot;little raft&quot;
* &quot;salçığ&quot;, meaning &quot;disputant&quot;

According to Caferoğlu, the name was derived from the root &quot;sil-&quot; in Old Uyghur, meaning &quot;clean&quot;. Although, the root of &quot;sil-&quot; was transformed as i &gt; e, and that the name was created by adding the diminutive of &quot;-çük&quot;. The meaning of the word could be interpreted as &quot;pure&quot;, &quot;clean&quot;, &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;a man of his word&quot;. It is argued that it was a unisex name, given both to boys as well as girls in the past and that some of these traits were sought in women, thus it would make more sense to name girls after some of these qualities.

According to Hungarian Turkologist László Rásonyi, his name should be read as Selcik. Josef Markwart proposed that the name should be read as Salçuk. Peter Benjamin Golden suggested the vocalization Salçuq ~ Saljuq, based on the Islamic and Syriac transcriptions and saw a connection with root &quot;sal-&quot; &quot;to move (something), to put into motion with some implication of violent motion&quot;, an etymology consistent with contemporary Turkic anthroponymy.

==Life==
===Origin===
Seljuk was the son of Tuqaq or Tuqaq Beg (دوقاق دمور یالیق &quot;Dûqâq Demur Yalığ&quot;)&quot;,&quot; known as &quot;Temür Yalığ&quot; (meaning &quot;iron bow&quot;) because of his skills in his works. In Oghuz culture, arrow and bow are considered as a sign of sovereignty and considering Duqaq&#x27;s nickname, he wasn&#x27;t an ordinary soldier, but a &quot;sü-başı&quot; (commander-in-chief). According to various sources, Duqaq was a powerful statesman and possessed great power and influence in the Oghuz Yabgu State and died around 924.

===Immigration to Jand===

Seljuk had great power and influence among the people of his tribe who lived within the territory of the Oghuz Yabgu State. The relationship between Seljuk and Oghuz Yabgu was overshadowed by an incident that is not well known because of lack of reliable sources. Nonetheless, Seljuk left the Oghuz Yabgu State and immigrated with his tribe, to the town of Jand, located on the left bank of the Syr Darya. It is rumored that there were 100 horseman, 1,500 camels and 50,000 sheep with Seljuk Beg during this migration. If each horseman equates to a family, the Seljuks who migrated to Jand were likely a small nomadic community of about 500 people.

Jand was an important border town in the steppes during the X to XIII centuries. This town, inhabited by both nomadic and sedentary people, served as gateway to the steppes. Jand was a relatively popular destination for Muslims and religious propagandists from Transoxiana as well as merchants from various places. There, Seljuk and his Oghuz tribe accepted Islam. This event took place after Seljuk had migrated to Jand in 985-986, and before Seljuk left for Transoxiana to help the Samanians in 992.

After accepting Islam, Seljuk expelled the officials sent by the Oghuz Yabgu to Jand to collect the annual tax, saying &quot;Muslims will not pay tribute to the unbelievers&quot;, and set up a war against the non-Muslim Turks. This may well be proved by Al-Bayhaqi who calls Seljuk Beg as &quot;al-Malik al-Ghâzî Seljuk&quot; (meaning &quot;ruler and religious fighter Seljuk&quot;).

The most important event that took place during this period was the death of Seljuk&#x27;s elder son Mikâ&#x27;îl, who was the father of Tughrul Beg and Chaghri Beg, founders of the Great Seljuk Empire. After this incident, the wife of Mikâ&#x27;îl (Tughril and Chaghri&#x27;s mother) married Yusuf, the other son of Seljuk. According to the old Turkic traditions (the reason for such a tradition was that someone could use a widowed noblewoman to gain strength among the tribe/country), while two of his sons, Tughrul and Chaghri, were raised by their grandfather Seljuk Beg.

===Relations with Samanids===

Seljuk, who gained power with his war activities in Jand and its vicinity, gradually became involved in politics in Transoxiana. After the Kara-khanid ruler Hasan b. Sulayman Bughra Khan captured the Samanid city of Bukhara, the Samanids asked Seljuk for aid against Bughra Khan. Upon this, Seljuk sent his eldest son Arslân (&quot;Isrâ&#x27;il&quot;) to Transoxiana.

Since Seljuk was getting old in this period, the administration was now actually in the hands of Arslân. In the meantime, the Samanid state, which thoroughly lost its power, was subjected to frequent renewed attacks by the Kara-khanids, which gave Arslan the opportunity to prove his military prowess. In a period when the Samanid state was shaken by the internal turmoil caused by Fâ&#x27;ik, Abû &#x27;Alî Simcûr, and Bek-tüzün, and the Kara-khanids who entered Transoxiana and seized Bukhara for the second time (999), the Seljuks under Arslân provided military assistance to Abû İbrâhîm İsma&#x27;îl al-Muntasir (1000–1005), the last member of the Samani dynasty (1003). Although al-Muntasir gained some success against the Kara-khanid army under the command of Ilig Khan Nasr with the support he received from the Seljuks, he couldn&#x27;t prevent the collapse of the Samanid state. Arslân himself was taken prisoner in 1025 by Mahmud the Ghaznavid. After this incident, all of Transoxiana came under the Kara-khanid rule and the Seljuks had to submit to the Kara-khanids.

===Relationship with Khazars===
It is speculated that according to some sources, Seljuk began his career as an officer in the Khazar army. These sources provide information about the ancestors of the Seljuks, records that Duqaq is connected to Khazar Melik. The fact that these records, which appear ambiguous in &quot;Melik-nâme&quot;, was repeated by Ibn Hassûl who wrote his work during the time of Tughrul Beg, does not leave any doubt about the Seljuk&#x27;s relationship with the Khazars. Due to a lack of resources, it is not possible to reveal the nature of this relationship nor to fully define its framework, yet it is difficult to say whether this relationship was done via Oghuz Yabgu state or independent. However, if political contact has been established between the ancestors of the Seljuks and the Khazars, the most appropriate date for this must be the middle of the second quarter of the X. century, when the Khazar Khaganate needed military help. As a result, it is possible that Duqaq had political and military relations with the Khazars during their collapse either directly or through the Oghuz Yabgu State, and that these memories could only be spoken verbally in the family reflect only the vague records of the Seljuk histories written about one hundred and fifty years later.

===Founding of the Seljuk dynasty===
Under Mikâîl&#x27;s sons Tughrul and Chaghri, the Seljuks migrated into Khurasan. Ghaznavid attempts to stop Seljuks raiding the local Muslim populace led to the Battle of Dandanaqan on 23 May 1040. Victorious Seljuks became masters of Khurasan, expanding their power into Transoxiana and across Iran. By 1055, Tuğrul had expanded his control all the way to Baghdad, setting himself up as the champion of the Abbasid caliph, who honored him with the title &quot;sultan&quot;. Earlier rulers may have used this title but the Seljuks seem to have been the first to inscribe it on their coins.

===Death===
Seljuk Beg died in Jand at the age of about a hundred towards the year 1009. After his death, Arslân, one of his three surviving sons, took over the administration under the old Oghuz traditions. His son Arslân, who had the title of yabgu, was assisted by Yusuf, who had the title of inal and Mûsâ, who had the title of inanç from his brothers. Meanwhile, Mikâ&#x27;îl&#x27;s sons Tughrul and Chaghri took their place in the administration as &quot;beg&quot; at the age of 14-15. Although Arslan Yabgu was the head of the family, the sons and grandchildren of Seljuk ruled the Turkoman Begs and other forces affiliated to them in a semi-connected manner in the line with the old Oghuz traditions.

==Family==
According to various sources, Seljuk had four or five sons: Isrâ&#x27;îl (&quot;Israel, Arslân)&quot;, Mikâ&#x27;îl (&quot;Michael&quot;), Mûsâ (&quot;Moses&quot;), Yusuf (&quot;Joseph&quot;) and/or Yûnus (&quot;Jonah&quot;). All five names mentioned are related to Judaism. Some researchers who pointed out the religious status of the names have concluded that the Seljuk family was either Khazar Judaic or Nestorian Christian before accepting Islam. However, given that the names of these individuals are widely used in the Islamic world, Turkish historians state that such an interpretation cannot be solely based on names.

<text>Adjudication is the legal process by which an arbiter or judge reviews evidence and argumentation, including legal reasoning set forth by opposing parties or litigants, to come to a decision which determines rights and obligations between the parties involved.

Adjudication can also refer to the processes at dance competitions, in television game shows and at other competitive forums, by which competitors are evaluated and ranked and a winner is found.

==Legal processes==
Adjudication may be defined as &quot;the legal process of resolving a dispute. The formal giving or pronouncing of a judgment or decree in a court proceeding; also the judgment or decision given. The entry of a decree by a court in respect to the parties in a case. It implies a hearing by a court, after notice, of legal evidence on the factual issue(s) involved; it may be equivalent to a determination. It indicates that the claims of all the parties there to have been considered and set at rest.&quot; In some cases, an application for adjudication is an alternative legal process instead of applying for a court hearing.

==Construction law==
===Australia===
Each state and territory has enacted security of payment legislation which provide for adjudication of progress construction claims, starting with New South Wales in 1999. There is very little harmony between the legislation in each jurisdiction regarding the scope of contract covered and the adjudication procedure. However, in all jurisdictions, adjudications are interim pending final resolution of the dispute under the relevant terms of the contract.

====New South Wales====
The &quot;Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999&quot; came into effect in New South Wales on 26 March 2000 and applies to all construction contracts commenced on or after that date. It is not possible to contract out of the legislation. Amendments to the Act made in 2013 are not retrospective, however, earlier amendments are. The Act does not apply to mining work, however, construction work ancillary to the operation of a mine is covered. The Act also does not apply to work undertaken for a resident owner within the meaning of the &quot;Home Building Act 1989&quot;.

In NSW, the 2016 case of &quot;Probuild Constructions (Aust) Pty Ltd v Shade Systems Pty Ltd&quot; has allowed an adjudicator&#x27;s determination for a non-jurisdictional error to be overturned through judicial review. The case went against &quot;Brodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport&quot; (2004), which had held that judicial intervention was limited to cases of a breach of essential and basic requirements.

====Queensland ====
The Building and Construction Industry Payments Act 2004 (BCIPA) came into effect in Queensland in October, 2004. Through a statutory-based adjudication process a claimant can seek to resolve payment on account disputes. The act covers construction, and related supply of goods and services, contracts, whether written or verbal. BCIPA is regulated by the Building and Construction Industry Payments Agency, a branch of the Queensland Building Services.

====Victoria ====
Adjudication is a relatively new process introduced by the government of Victoria, Australia, to allow for the rapid determination of progress claims under building contracts or sub-contracts and contracts for the supply of goods or services in the building industry. This process was designed to ensure cash flow to businesses in the building industry, without parties getting tied up in lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration. It is regulated by the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2002.

Builders, sub-contractors and suppliers need to carefully choose a nominating authority to which they make an adjudication application.

===United Kingdom===
The relevant legislation in regard to construction in the United Kingdom is the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 (1996 Chapter 53), later amended by Part 8 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009.

Any party to a construction contract has the right to refer a dispute arising under the contract to a third party for adjudication, whose decision shall be binding unless the courts or an arbitrator have already made a determination on the referred issue. The Act does not define &quot;adjudication&quot; or an &quot;adjudicator&quot;, but an adjudicator&#x27;s obligation is to act &quot;impartially&quot; (section 108(2)(e)). The parties can agree between themselves who will undertake the adjudication, but where they cannot agree, either party may ask an Adjudicator Nominating Body (ANB) to appoint one. The &quot;Scheme for Construction Contracts&quot; set up under the Scheme for Construction Contracts (England and Wales) Regulations 1998 contains a set of adjudication provisions which are to apply to a construction contract unless the contract itself includes arrangements for adjudication which comply in full with statutory requirements.

 In Scotland, the Scheme for Construction Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 1998 apply.

For there to be a dispute capable of being addressed by adjudication, &quot;it must be clear that a point has emerged from the process of discussion or negotiation that has ended and that there is something which needs to be decided&quot;.

Section 108(3) of the 1996 Act and paragraph 23(2) of the Scheme for Construction Contracts state that &quot;the decision of the adjudicator shall be binding on the parties, and they shall comply with it until the dispute is finally determined by legal proceedings, by arbitration ... or by agreement between the parties&quot;. In the case of &quot;Aspect Contracts (Asbestos) Limited (Respondent) v Higgins Construction Plc (Appellant)&quot;, heard in 2015, the Supreme Court of England and Wales argued that the wording would have been clearer if had said &quot;unless and until&quot; instead of merely &quot;until&quot;.

The phrase &quot;true value adjudication&quot; is sometimes used in relation to the role of an adjudicator, meaning that the adjudicator is asked to determine the true value of a completed construction where this may be different from the value claimed by the contractor and/or paid by the client. The term &quot;smash and grab&quot; claim refers to the practice of submitting a large interim payment application at the end of the construction phase of a project, but before completion of the final account, and the term &quot;&#x27;smash and grab&#x27; adjudication&quot; has been used in relation to several adjudication decisions regarding liability for interim payment of such claims.

====Selected cases====
In a 2010 case involving two consecutive adjudications in relation to a construction contract for homeowner Charles Wishart, the High Court allowed the second adjudicator&#x27;s ruling on an issue which the first adjudicator had commented on and purported to have resolved, but which was not part of, and &quot;wholly unnecessary&quot; to resolve as far as the initial adjudication was concerned. In other circumstances, an adjudicator&#x27;s ruling is binding and a point which has been resolved cannot be raised again, but where the adjudicator went outside the scope of the adjudication referred to them, their comments were not a binding part of the ruling.

In relation to a 2012 case, &quot;Herbosh-Kiere Marine Contractors Ltd v Dover Harbour Board&quot;, Matt Molloy notes that there can be a distinction between &quot;statutory adjudication&quot;, applying the processes set out in legislation, and &quot;contractual adjudication&quot;, where a complainant exercises a right provided for in their contract. In this case, which related to a wreck-removal agreement requiring the contractor to remove the remains of a boat sunk to stop torpedoes being fired into Dover Harbour during World War I, the court determined that the adjudicator had exceeded his jurisdiction and the adjudicator&#x27;s ruling was therefore not upheld.

In the same case, reference is made to a 2006 Court of Appeal ruling, &quot;Carillion Construction v Devonport Royal Dockyard&quot;, in which Lord Justice Chadwick reminded litigants that in the UK context, &quot;the majority of adjudicators are not chosen for their expertise as lawyers. Their skills are as likely (if not more likely) to lie in other disciplines. The task of the adjudicator is not to act as arbitrator or judge. The time constraints within which he is expected to operate are proof of that. The task of the adjudicator is to find an interim solution which meets the needs of the case.&quot;

==Healthcare==

&quot;Claims adjudication&quot; is a phrase used in the insurance industry to refer to the process of paying claims submitted or denying them after comparing claims to the benefit or coverage requirements. The adjudication process consists of receiving a claim from an insured person and then utilizing software to process claims and make a decision or doing so manually. If it is done automatically using software or a web-based subscription, the claim process is called auto-adjudication. Automating claims often improve efficiency and reduce expenses required for manual claims adjudication. Many claims are submitted on paper and are processed manually by insurance workers.

After the claims adjudication process is complete, the insurance company often sends a letter to the person filing the claim describing the outcome. The letter, which is sometimes referred to as remittance advice, includes a statement as to whether the claim was denied or approved. If the company denied the claim, it has to provide an explanation for the reason why under regional laws. The company also often sends an explanation of benefits that includes detailed information about how each service included in the claim was settled. Insurance companies will then send out payments to the providers if the claims are approved or to the provider&#x27;s billing service.

The process of claims adjudication, in this context, is also called &quot;medical billing advocacy&quot;.

==Background investigations (employment)==

In the United States, adjudication is the process directly following a background investigation where the investigation results are reviewed to determine whether a candidate should be awarded a security clearance, or is suitable for a public trust position, which is a job that requires a very knowledgeable and responsible person, often related to national security. It may be determined that the person is not suitable for a public trust position, but is suitable for a non-sensitive position. However, a person may be deemed unsuitable for any position.

From the United States Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility: &quot;Adjudication is the review and consideration of all available information to ensure an individual&#x27;s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that entrusting an individual with national security information or assigning an individual to sensitive duties is clearly in the best interest of national security.&quot;

==Emergency response ==
Adjudication is the &quot;process of identifying, with reasonable certainty, the type or nature of material or device that set off an alarm and assessing the potential threat that the material or device might pose with corresponding implications for the need to take further action.&quot;

==Referring to a minor==
Referring to a minor, the term adjudicated can refer to children who are under a court&#x27;s jurisdiction, usually as a result of having engaged in delinquent behavior and not having a legal guardian that could be entrusted with being responsible for him or her. A child dependency or neglect adjudication can also result in a determination that a child is in need of services. Different US states have different processes for declaring a child as adjudicated. Arizona state law defines a dually adjudicated child as &quot;a child who is found to be dependent or temporarily subject to court jurisdiction pending an adjudication of a dependency petition and who is alleged or found to have committed a delinquent or incorrigible act&quot;. According to Illinois state law, &quot;adjudicated&quot; means that the Juvenile Court has entered an order declaring that a child &quot;is neglected, abused, dependent, a minor requiring authoritative intervention, a delinquent minor or an addicted minor&quot;.

<doc id="219995" wikidata="Q189545" url="?curid=219995" title="Zengid dynasty">
<text>The Zengid or Zangid dynasty, also referred to as the Atabegate of Mosul, Aleppo and Damascus (Arabic: أتابكة الموصل وحلب ودمشق), or the Zengid State (Old Anatolian: , Modern Turkish: ; ) was initially an &quot;Atabegate&quot; of the Seljuk Empire created in 1127. It formed a Turkoman dynasty of Sunni Muslim faith, which ruled parts of the Levant and Upper Mesopotamia, and eventually seized control of Egypt in 1169. In 1174 the Zengid state extended from Tripoli to Hamadan and from Yemen to Sivas. Imad ad-Din Zengi was the first ruler of the dynasty.

The Zengid &quot;Atabegate&quot; became famous in the Islamic world for its successes against the Crusaders, and for being the &quot;Atabegate&quot; from which Saladin originated. Following the demise of the Seljuk dynasty in 1194, the Zengids persisted for several decades as one of the &quot;Seljuk successor-states&quot; until 1250.

==History==

In 1127, following the murder of Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, &quot;atabeg&quot; of Mosul, the Seljuk Empire decided to name Zengi, son of Aq Sunqur al-Hajib, Seljuk Governor of Aleppo, as the new Seljuk atabeg of Mosul. Before this nomination, Zengi had been a successful Seljuk general in Iraq, where he had become &quot;shihna&quot;, or Governor for the whole region.

Zengi quickly became the chief Turkic potentate in Northern Syria and Iraq, taking Aleppo from the squabbling Artuqids in 1128 and capturing the County of Edessa from the Crusaders after the siege of Edessa in 1144. This latter feat made Zengi a hero in the Muslim world, but he was assassinated by a slave two years later, in 1146. On Zengi&#x27;s death, his territories were divided, with Mosul and his lands in Iraq going to his eldest son Saif ad-Din Ghazi I, and Aleppo and Edessa falling to his second son, Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo.

===Conflict with the Crusaders===
Nur ad-Din proved to be as competent as his father. In 1146 he defeated the Crusaders at the Siege of Edessa. In 1149, he defeated Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, at the battle of Inab, and the next year conquered the remnants of the County of Edessa west of the Euphrates. In 1154, he capped off these successes by his capture of Damascus from the Turkic Burid dynasty that ruled it.

Now ruling from Damascus, Nur ad-Din&#x27;s success continued. Another Prince of Antioch, Raynald of Châtillon was captured, and the territories of the Principality of Antioch were greatly reduced.

===Conquests===

After the defeats of the Seljuk Empire in Khorasan and the death of the Seljuk ruler Ahmad Sanjar in 1157, the Zengids remained nominally under Seljuk suzerainty, but in practice became essentially independent.

In the 1160s, Nur ad-Din&#x27;s attention was mostly held by a competition with the King of Jerusalem, Amalric of Jerusalem, for control of the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt. From 1163 to 1169, Shirkuh, a military commander in the service of the Zengid dynasty, took part in a series of campaigns in Fatimid Egypt, on the pretext to help the Fatimid vizier Shawar regain his throne from his rival Dirgham, and in opposition to the Crusader invasions of Egypt. In 1164, Latin Patriarch of Antioch Aimery of Limoges sent a letter to King Louis VII of France, in which he described the events in the Crusader States: &quot;[Shirkuh] having gotten possession of Damascus, the latter entered Egypt with a great force of Turks, in order to conquer the country.&quot;

In 1163, the vizier to the Fatimid caliph al-Adid, Shawar, had been driven out of Egypt by his rival Dirgham, a member of the powerful Banu Ruzzaik tribe. He asked for military backing from Nur ad-Din, who complied and, in 1164, sent Shirkuh to aid Shawar in his expedition against Dirgham. Shirkuh&#x27;s nephew Saladin, at age 26, went along with them. After Shawar was successfully reinstated as vizier, he demanded that Shirkuh withdraw his army from Egypt for a sum of 30,000 gold dinars, but Shirkuh refused, insisting it was Nur ad-Din&#x27;s will that he remain.
In 1167, the Zengids engaged in a new campaign in Egypt. They sacked Bilbais, and the Crusader-Egyptian force and Shirkuh&#x27;s army were to engage in the Battle of al-Babein on the desert border of the Nile, just west of Giza. The Crusader force enjoyed early success against Shirkuh&#x27;s troops, but the terrain was too steep and sandy for their horses, and commander Hugh of Caesarea was captured while attacking Saladin&#x27;s unit. The battle ended in a Zengid victory, one of the &quot;most remarkable victories in recorded history&quot;, according to Ibn al-Athir. Saladin and Shirkuh moved towards Alexandria where they were welcomed, given money and arms, and provided a base. Faced by a superior Crusader–Egyptian force attempting to besiege the city, Shirkuh split his army. He and the bulk of his force withdrew from Alexandria, while Saladin was left with the task of guarding the city.
In 1168, the Zengid army was called for a third time in Egypt, as the Crusaders were besieging Cairo. The Crusaders lifted the siege and left. In 1169, Shirkuh lured the vizier into an ambush and killed him after which he seized Egypt in the name of his master Nur ad-Din, becoming the new Fatimid vizier and &quot;amir al-juyush&quot; with the approval of Caliph al-Adid, and therefore bringing Egypt under formal Zengid dominion. Shirkuh died the same year and was replaced by his nephew Saladin as vizier.

During the reign of Nur al-Din (1146–1174), Tripoli, Yemen and the Hejaz were added to the state of the Zengids. The Artuqids became vassals of the Zengids. Nur ad-Din also took control of Anatolian lands up to Sivas. His state extended from Tripoli to Hamadan and from Yemen to Sivas.

Shirkuh&#x27;s nephew Saladin was appointed vizier by the last Fatimid caliph al-Adid and Governor of Egypt, in 1169. Al-Adid died in 1171, and Saladin took advantage of this power vacuum, effectively taking control of the country. Upon seizing power, he switched Egypt&#x27;s allegiance to the Baghdad-based Abbasid Caliphate which adhered to Sunni Islam, rather than traditional Fatimid Shia practice.

===Loss of Egypt and Syria to Saladin (1175–1176)===

In the early summer of 1174, Nur ad-Din was mustering an army, sending summons to Mosul, Diyar Bakr, and the Jazira in an apparent preparation of an attack against Saladin&#x27;s Egypt. The Ayyubids held a council upon the revelation of these preparations to discuss the possible threat and Saladin collected his own troops outside Cairo.

On 15 May 1174, Nur ad-Din died after falling ill the previous week and his power was handed to his eleven-year-old son as-Salih Ismail al-Malik. His death left Saladin with political independence and in a letter to as-Salih, he promised to &quot;act as a sword&quot; against his enemies and referred to the death of his father as an &quot;earthquake shock&quot;. In the wake of Nur ad-Din&#x27;s death, Saladin was tempted to annex Syria before it could possibly fall into the hands of a rival, but he feared that attacking a land that formerly belonged to his master —forbidden in the Islamic principles in which he believed— could portray him as hypocritical, thus making him unsuitable for leading the war against the Crusaders.

As-Salih took refuge in Aleppo in August 1174, which he ruled until 1181, when he died of illness and was replaced by his cousin Imad al-Din Zengi II. Gumushtigin, the emir of the city and a captain of Nur ad-Din&#x27;s veterans assumed guardianship over him. The emir Gumushtigin prepared to unseat all his rivals in Syria and the Jazira, beginning with Damascus. In this emergency, the emir of Damascus appealed to Saif ad-Din of Mosul (a cousin of Gumushtigin) for assistance against Aleppo, but he refused, forcing the Syrians to request the aid of Saladin, who complied. Saladin rode across the desert with 700 picked horsemen, passing through al-Kerak then reaching Bosra. According to his own account, he was joined by &quot;emirs, soldiers, and Bedouins—the emotions of their hearts to be seen on their faces.&quot; On 23 November, he arrived in Damascus amid general acclamation and rested at his father&#x27;s old home there, until the gates of the Citadel of Damascus, whose commander Raihan initially refused to surrender, were opened to Saladin four days later, after a brief siege by his brother Tughtakin ibn Ayyub. He installed himself in the castle and received the homage and salutations of the inhabitants.

Leaving his brother Tughtakin ibn Ayyub as Governor of Damascus, Saladin proceeded to reduce other cities that had belonged to Nur ad-Din, but were now practically independent. His army conquered Hama with relative ease, but avoided attacking Homs because of the strength of its citadel. Saladin moved north towards Aleppo, besieging it on 30 December after Gumushtigin refused to abdicate his throne. As-Salih, fearing capture by Saladin, came out of his palace and appealed to the inhabitants not to surrender him and the city to the invading force. One of Saladin&#x27;s chroniclers claimed &quot;the people came under his spell&quot;.

Meanwhile, Saladin&#x27;s rivals in Syria and Jazira waged a propaganda war against him, claiming he had &quot;forgotten his own condition [servant of Nur ad-Din]&quot; and showed no gratitude for his old master by besieging his son, rising &quot;in rebellion against his Lord&quot;. Soon, Saladin entered Homs and captured its citadel in March 1175, after stubborn resistance from its defenders.

====Battle of the Horns of Hama (1175)====

Saladin&#x27;s successes alarmed Saif ad-Din, Zengid ruler of Mosul. As head of the Zengids, he regarded Syria and Mesopotamia as his family estate and was angered when Saladin attempted to usurp his dynasty&#x27;s holdings. Saif ad-Din mustered a large army and dispatched it to Aleppo, whose defenders anxiously had awaited them. The combined forces of Mosul and Aleppo marched against Saladin in Hama. Heavily outnumbered, Saladin initially attempted to make terms with the Zengids by abandoning all conquests north of the Damascus province, but they refused, insisting he return to Egypt. Seeing that confrontation was unavoidable, Saladin prepared for battle, taking up a superior position at the Horns of Hama, hills by the gorge of the Orontes River. On 13 April 1175, the Zengid troops marched to attack his forces, but soon found themselves surrounded by Saladin&#x27;s Ayyubid veterans, who crushed them. The battle ended in a decisive victory for Saladin, who pursued the Zengid fugitives to the gates of Aleppo, forcing as-Salih&#x27;s advisers to recognize Saladin&#x27;s control of the provinces of Damascus, Homs, and Hama, as well as a number of towns outside Aleppo such as Ma&#x27;arat al-Numan.
After his victory against the Zengids, Saladin proclaimed himself king and suppressed the name of as-Salih in Friday prayers and Islamic coinage. From then on, he ordered prayers in all the mosques of Syria and Egypt as the sovereign king and he issued at the Cairo mint gold coins bearing his official title —&quot;al-Malik an-Nasir Yusuf Ayyub, ala ghaya&quot; &quot;the King Strong to Aid, Joseph son of Job; exalted be the standard.&quot; The Abbasid caliph in Baghdad graciously welcomed Saladin&#x27;s assumption of power and declared him &quot;Sultan of Egypt and Syria&quot;. The Battle of Hama did not end the contest for power between the Ayyubids and the Zengids, with the final confrontation occurring in the spring of 1176. Saladin had gathered massive reinforcements from Egypt while Saif ad-Din was levying troops among the minor states of Diyarbakir and al-Jazira. When Saladin crossed the Orontes, leaving Hama, the sun was eclipsed. He viewed this as an omen, but he continued his march north. He reached the Sultan&#x27;s Mound, roughly from Aleppo, where his forces encountered Saif ad-Din&#x27;s army. A hand-to-hand fight ensued and the Zengids managed to plough Saladin&#x27;s left-wing, driving it before him when Saladin himself charged at the head of the Zengid guard. The Zengid forces panicked and most of Saif ad-Din&#x27;s officers ended up being killed or captured—Saif ad-Din narrowly escaped. The Zengid army&#x27;s camp, horses, baggage, tents, and stores were seized by the Ayyubids. The Zengid prisoners of war, however, were given gifts and freed. All of the booty from the Ayyubid victory was accorded to the army, Saladin not keeping anything himself.

Saladin continued towards Aleppo, which still closed its gates to him, halting before the city. On the way, his army took Buza&#x27;a and then captured Manbij. From there, they headed west to besiege the fortress of A&#x27;zaz on 15 May. A&#x27;zaz capitulated on 21 June 1176, and Saladin then hurried his forces to Aleppo to punish Gumushtigin. His assaults were again resisted, but he managed to secure not only a truce, but a mutual alliance with Aleppo, in which Gumushtigin and as-Salih were allowed to continue their hold on the city, and in return, they recognized Saladin as the sovereign over all of the dominions he conquered. The Artuqid &quot;emirs&quot; of Mardin and Keyfa, the Muslim allies of Aleppo, also recognised Saladin as the King of Syria. When the treaty was concluded, the younger sister of as-Salih came to Saladin and requested the return of the Fortress of A&#x27;zaz; he complied and escorted her back to the gates of Aleppo with numerous presents.

The Zengis ruler As-Salih Ismail al-Malik continued to rule Aleppo as a vassal of Saladin until 1181, when he died of illness and was replaced by his cousin Imad al-Din Zengi II.

===Loss of Jazira to Saladin (1182)===

The Zengid ruler Sayf al-Din Ghazi II died in June 1181 and his brother Izz ad-Din inherited the leadership of Mosul. On 4 December, the crown prince of the Zengids, as-Salih, died in Aleppo. Prior to his death, he had his chief officers swear an oath of loyalty to Izz ad-Din, as he was the only Zengid ruler strong enough to oppose Saladin. Izz ad-Din was welcomed in Aleppo, but possessing it and Mosul put too great of a strain on his abilities. He thus, handed Aleppo to his brother Imad ad-Din Zangi, in exchange for Sinjar. Saladin offered no opposition to these transactions in order to respect the treaty he previously made with the Zengids.

Following the Zengid defeat at Hama, and the continuing lack any unifying figure in the mould of Nur ad-Din, Kukbary (Muzaffar ad-Din Gökböri), the Zengid ruler of Harran, realised that Zengid power was on the wane in Syria and the Jazira and he made the momentous decision to defect to Saladin in 1182. He invited Saladin to occupy the Jazira region, making up northern Mesopotamia. Saladin complied and the truce between him and the Zengids officially ended in September 1182. Prior to his march to Jazira, tensions had grown between the Zengid rulers of the region, primarily concerning their unwillingness to pay deference to Mosul. Before he crossed the Euphrates, Saladin besieged Aleppo for three days, signaling that the truce was over.

Once Saladin reached Bira, near the river, he was joined by Kukbary and Nur ad-Din of Hisn Kayfa and the combined forces captured the cities of Jazira, one after the other. First, Edessa fell, followed by Saruj, then Raqqa, Qirqesiya and Nusaybin. Raqqa was an important crossing point and held by Qutb ad-Din Inal, who had lost Manbij to Saladin in 1176. Upon seeing the large size of Saladin&#x27;s army, he made little effort to resist and surrendered on the condition that he would retain his property. From Raqqa, Saladin moved to conquer al-Fudain, al-Husain, Maksim, Durain, &#x27;Araban, and Khabur—all of which swore allegiance to him.

Saladin proceeded to take Nusaybin which offered no resistance. A medium-sized town, Nusaybin was not of great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. Meanwhile, in Aleppo, the &quot;emir&quot; of the city Zangi raided Saladin&#x27;s cities to the north and east, such as Balis, Manbij, Saruj, Buza&#x27;a, al-Karzain. He also destroyed his own citadel at A&#x27;zaz to prevent it from being used by the Ayyubids if they were to conquer it.

===Battle for Mosul (1182–1183)===

As Saladin approached Mosul, he faced the issue of taking over a large city and justifying the action. The Zengids of Mosul appealed to an-Nasir, the Abbasid caliph at Baghdad whose vizier favored them. An-Nasir sent Badr al-Badr (a high-ranking religious figure) to mediate between the two sides. Saladin arrived at the city on 10 November 1182. Izz ad-Din would not accept his terms because he considered them disingenuous and extensive, and Saladin immediately laid siege to the heavily fortified city.

After several minor skirmishes and a stalemate in the siege that was initiated by the caliph, Saladin intended to find a way to withdraw without damage to his reputation while still keeping up some military pressure. He decided to attack Sinjar, which was held by Izz ad-Din&#x27;s brother Sharaf ad-Din. It fell after a 15-day siege on 30 December. Saladin&#x27;s soldiers broke their discipline, plundering the city; Saladin managed to protect the governor and his officers only by sending them to Mosul. After establishing a garrison at Sinjar, he awaited a coalition assembled by Izz ad-Din consisting of his forces, those from Aleppo, Mardin, and Armenia. Saladin and his army met the coalition at Harran in February 1183, but on hearing of his approach, the latter sent messengers to Saladin asking for peace. Each force returned to their cities and al-Fadil wrote: &quot;They [Izz ad-Din&#x27;s coalition] advanced like men, like women they vanished.&quot;
From the point of view of Saladin, in terms of territory, the war against Mosul was going well, but he still failed to achieve his objectives and his army was shrinking; Taqi ad-Din took his men back to Hama, while Nasir ad-Din Muhammad and his forces had left. This encouraged Izz ad-Din and his allies to take the offensive. The previous coalition regrouped at Harzam some 140 km from Harran. In early April, without waiting for Nasir ad-Din, Saladin and Taqi ad-Din commenced their advance against the coalition, marching eastward to Ras al-Ein unhindered. By late April, after three days of &quot;actual fighting&quot;, according to Saladin, the Ayyubids had captured Amid. He handed the city to Nur ad-Din Muhammad together with its stores, which consisted of 80,000 candles, a tower full of arrowheads, and 1,040,000 books. In return for a diploma—granting him the city, Nur ad-Din swore allegiance to Saladin, promising to follow him in every expedition in the war against the Crusaders, and repairing the damage done to the city. The fall of Amid, in addition to territory, convinced Il-Ghazi of Mardin to enter the service of Saladin, weakening Izz ad-Din&#x27;s coalition.

Saladin attempted to gain the Caliph an-Nasir&#x27;s support against Izz ad-Din by sending him a letter requesting a document that would give him legal justification for taking over Mosul and its territories. Saladin aimed to persuade the caliph claiming that while he conquered Egypt and Yemen under the flag of the Abbasids, the Zengids of Mosul openly supported the Seljuks (rivals of the caliphate) and only came to the Caliph when in need. He also accused Izz ad-Din&#x27;s forces of disrupting the Muslim &quot;Holy War&quot; against the Crusaders, stating &quot;they are not content not to fight, but they prevent those who can&quot;. Saladin defended his own conduct claiming that he had come to Syria to fight the Crusaders, end the heresy of the Assassins, and stop the wrong-doing of the Muslims. He also promised that if Mosul was given to him, it would lead to the capture of Jerusalem, Constantinople, Georgia, and the lands of the Almohads in the Maghreb, &quot;until the word of God is supreme and the Abbasid caliphate has wiped the world clean, turning the churches into mosques&quot;. Saladin stressed that all this would happen by the will of God, and instead of asking for financial or military support from the Caliph, he would capture and give the Caliph the territories of Tikrit, Daquq, Khuzestan, Kish Island, and Oman.

===Fall of Zengid Aleppo (1183)===

Saladin turned his attention from Mosul to Aleppo, sending his brother Taj al-Muluk Buri to capture Tell Khalid, 130 km northeast of Aleppo. A siege was set, but the governor of Tell Khalid surrendered upon the arrival of Saladin himself on 17 May before a siege could take place. According to Imad ad-Din, after Tell Khalid, Saladin took a detour northwards to Aintab, but he gained possession of it when his army turned towards it, allowing him to quickly move backward another c. 100 km towards Aleppo. On 21 May, he camped outside the city, positioning himself east of the Citadel of Aleppo, while his forces encircled the suburb of Banaqusa to the northeast and Bab Janan to the west. He stationed his men dangerously close to the city, hoping for an early success.

Zangi did not offer long resistance. He was unpopular with his subjects and wished to return to his Sinjar, the city he governed previously. An exchange was negotiated where Zangi would hand over Aleppo to Saladin in return for the restoration of his control of Sinjar, Nusaybin, and Raqqa. Zangi would hold these territories as Saladin&#x27;s vassals in terms of military service. On 12 June, Aleppo was formally placed in Ayyubid hands. The people of Aleppo had not known about these negotiations and were taken by surprise when Saladin&#x27;s standard was hoisted over the citadel. Two &quot;emir&quot;s, including an old friend of Saladin, Izz ad-Din Jurduk, welcomed and pledged their service to him. Saladin replaced the Hanafi courts with Shafi&#x27;i administration, despite a promise that he would not interfere in the religious leadership of the city. Although he was short of money, Saladin also allowed the departing Zangi to take all the stores of the citadel that he could travel with and to sell the remainder—which Saladin purchased himself. In spite of his earlier hesitation to go through with the exchange, he had no doubts about his success, stating that Aleppo was &quot;the key to the lands&quot; and &quot;this city is the eye of Syria and the citadel is its pupil&quot;. For Saladin, the capture of the city marked the end of over eight years of waiting since he told Farrukh-Shah that &quot;we have only to do the milking and Aleppo will be ours&quot;.

===Final decline (1183–1250)===

Saladin conquered Aleppo in 1183, ending Zengid rule in Syria. Saladin launched his last offensive against Mosul in late 1185, hoping for an easy victory over the presumably demoralized Zengid Emir of Mosul Mas&#x27;ud, but failed due to the city&#x27;s unexpectedly stiff resistance and a serious illness which caused Saladin to withdraw to Harran. Upon Abbasid encouragement, Saladin and Mas&#x27;ud negotiated a treaty in March 1186 that left the Zengids in control of Mosul, but under the obligation to supply the Ayyubids with military support when requested.

In 1204, Saladin&#x27;s brother and successor, the Ayyubid ruler Al-Adil I, dispatched an army under the leadership of his own son al-Ashraf of Harran, accompanied by his brother Al-Awhad Ayyub, to relieve the Zengid &quot;emir&quot; of Sinjar, Qutb al-Din, from an assault by his cousin Nur ad-Din Arslan Shah I of Mosul, the chief Zengid &quot;emir&quot;. In April 1204 the Ayyubid coalition swiftly defeated Nur ad-Din&#x27;s forces at Nusaybin, chasing them back to Mosul where they attacked several of the surrounding villages. By September the Ayyubids had established a peace with Nur ad-Din.

In 1207, the Ayyubids under Al-Awhad Ayyub, starting from their base in Mayyafariqin, captured Akhlat in Anatolia, putting an end to the Ahlatshahs.
Al-Adil I again attempted to annex the Zengid states in 1209, and besieged Sinjar. The Zengid ruler of Mosul Nur al-Din Arslan Shah I allied with Muzzafar al-Din Kukburi, ruler of Erbil, and resisted the Ayyubid offensive. They reached a truce, according to which al-Adid could retain the lands he conquered in Sinjar (thereafter ruled by the &quot;Ayyubids of Mayyafariqin &amp; Jabal Sinjar&quot;, the sons of al-Adid al-Ashraf and Al-Awhad Ayyub), and Arslan Shah would recognize Ayyubid suzerainty on his coinage. As Arslan Shah&#x27;s health was declining, and his sons were still young, he chose his Commander of the Army Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; as protector of his sons and promoted him to &quot;atabeg&quot; upon his death in 1211. The son and two grandsons of Arslan Shah continued to rule as children in Northern Iraq as Emirs of Mosul and Sinjar until 1234, when Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; formally took over, possibly after assassinating the last Zengid Emir of Mosul Nasir ad-Din Mahmud. He ruled in his own name from 1234 until his death in 1259, accepting Mongol suzerainty after 1243.

Northern Iraq (al-Jazira region), continued to be under Zengid rule until 1250, with its last Emir Mahmud al-Malik al-Zahir (1241–1250, son of Mu&#x27;izz al-Din Mahmud). In 1250, al-Jazira fell under the domination of An-Nasir Yusuf, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, marking the end of Zengid rule.

The next period would be marked by the arrival of the Mongols: in 1262 Mosul was sacked by the Mongols of Hulagu, following a siege of almost a year, which put an end to the short rule of the sons of Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;.

==Military==
The military of the Zengids, like that of the other &quot;Atabegates&quot;, continued the traditions of the Seljuk Empire. Professional &quot;Askar&quot; and &quot;Ghulam&quot; troops were combined with mercenaries and auxiliary Turcoman &amp; Kurdish tribal elements. The best description of these troops appears in the mid-13th century &quot;Warqa wa Gulshah&quot;, where numerous weapons are depicted, such as javelins, spears, swords, bows, maces and lassos. The protective equipment can be quite heavy, including helmets and hauberk. Bows and arrows were used extensively, and dense volleys could pierce armour or even stop a Crusader charge on occasion. Against regular armies, Turcoman harassment techniques were extensively used.

The Zengids in particular played a major military role against Crusaders, led by such major military figures as Imad al-Din Zengi or Nur al-Din Zengi. Nur al-Din&#x27;s army mainly consisted in Turcoman horse archers and Kurd spear-armed horsemen, in addition to professional &quot;ghulams&quot;, and Bedouin auxiliary cavalry, as well as large infantry elements. They were also skilled in siege warfare. Numbers were not very large, the ruler&#x27;s &quot;askar&quot; troops numbering from 1,000 to 3,000, to which were added auxiliary troops numbering from 10,000 to 15,000. The Zengid model was also used by Saladin and his successors.

==Metalwork==
In the 13th century, Mosul had a flourishing industry making luxury brass items that were ornately inlaid with silver. Many of these items survive today; in fact, of all medieval Islamic artifacts, Mosul brasswork has the most epigraphic inscriptions. However, the only reference to this industry in contemporary sources is the account of Ibn Sa&#x27;id, an Andalusian geographer who traveled through the region around 1250. He wrote that &quot;there are many crafts in the city, especially inlaid brass vessels which are exported (and presented) to rulers&quot;. These were expensive items that only the wealthiest could afford, and it wasn&#x27;t until the early 1200s that Mosul had the demand for large-scale production of them. Mosul was then a wealthy, prosperous capital city, first for the Zengids and then for Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;.

The origins of Mosul&#x27;s inlaid brasswork industry are uncertain. The city had an iron industry in the late 10th century, when al-Muqaddasi recorded that it exported iron and iron goods like buckets, knives and chains. However, no surviving metal objects from Mosul are known before the early 13th century. Inlaid metalworking in the Islamic world was first developed in Khurasan in the 12th century by silversmiths facing a shortage of silver. By the mid-12th century, Herat in particular had gained a reputation for its high-quality inlaid metalwork. The practice of inlaying &quot;required relatively few tools&quot; and the technique spread westward, perhaps by Khurasani artisans moving to other cities.
By the turn of the 13th century, the silver-inlaid-brass technique had reached Mosul. A pair of engraved brass &quot;flabella&quot; found in Egypt and possibly made in Mosul are dated by a Syriac inscription to the year 1202, which would make them the earliest known Mosul brasses with a definite date (although they are not inlaid with anything). One extant item may be even older: an inlaid ewer by the master craftsman Ibrahim ibn Mawaliya is of an unknown date, but D.S. Rice estimated that it was made around 1200. Production of inlaid brasswork in Mosul may have already begun before the turn of the century.

The body of Mosul metalwork significantly expands in the 1220s - several signed and dated items are known from this decade, which according to Julian Raby &quot;probably reflects the craft&#x27;s growing status and production.&quot; In the two decades from roughly 1220 to 1240, the Mosul brass industry saw &quot;rapid innovations in technique, decoration, and composition&quot;. Artisans were inspired by miniature paintings produced in the Mosul area.

Mosul seems to have become predominant among Muslim centers of metalwork in the early 13th century. Evidence is partial and indirect - relatively few objects which directly state where they were made exist, and in the rest of cases it depends on &quot;nisbah&quot;s. However, al-Mawsili is by far the most common &quot;nisbah&quot;; only two others are attested: al-Is&#x27;irdi (referring to someone from Siirt) and al-Baghdadi. There are, however, some scientific instruments inlaid with silver that were made in Syria during this period, with the earliest being 1222/3 (619 AH).

Instability after the death of Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; in 1259, and especially the Mongol siege and capture of Mosul in July 1262, probably caused a decline in Mosul&#x27;s metalworking industry. There is a relative lack of known metalwork from the Jazira in the late 1200s; meanwhile, an abundance of metalwork from Mamluk Syria and Egypt is attested from this same period. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that production in Mosul ended, though, and some extant objects from this period may have been made in Mosul.

==Literature==
The area including Syria, Jazira and Iraq saw an &quot;explosion of figural art&quot; from the 12th to 13th centuries, particularly in the areas of decorative art and illustrated manuscripts. This occurred despite religious condemnations against the depiction of living creatures, on the grounds that &quot;it implies a likeness to the creative activity of God&quot;.

The origins of this new pictorial tradition are uncertain, but Arabic illustrated manuscripts such as the &quot;Maqamat al-Hariri&quot; shared many characteristics with Christian Syriac illustrated manuscripts, such as Syriac Gospels (British Library, Add. 7170). This synthesis seems to point to a common pictorial tradition that existed since circa 1180 CE in the region, which was highly influenced by Byzantine art.

The manuscript &quot;Kitâb al-Diryâq&quot; (, &quot;The Book of Theriac&quot;), or &quot;Book of anditodes of pseudo-Galen&quot;, is a medieval manuscript allegedly based on the writings of Galen (&quot;pseudo-Galen&quot;). It describes the use of Theriac, an ancient medicinal compound initially used as a cure for the bites of poisonous snakes. Two editions are extant, adorned with beautiful miniatures revealing of the social context at the time of their publication. The earliest manuscript was published in 1198–1199 CE in Mosul or the Jazira region, and is now in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (MS. Arabe 2964).

The &quot;Kitab al-Aghani&quot; was created in 1218–1219 in Mosul at the time of the Zengid &quot;atabegate&quot; of Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; (40 years old at the time), and has several frontispieces richly illustrated with court scenes.

==Architecture==
The Zengids are known for numerous constructions from Syria to northern Iraq. The Citadel of Aleppo was fortified by the Zengids during the Crusades. Imad ad-Din Zengi, followed by his son Nur ad-Din (ruled 1147–1174), unified Aleppo and Damascus and held back the Crusaders from their repeated assaults on the cities. In addition to his many works in both Aleppo and Damascus, Nur ad-Din rebuilt the Aleppo city walls and fortified the citadel. Arab sources report that he also made several other improvements, such as a high, brick-walled entrance ramp, a palace, and a racecourse likely covered with grass. Nur ad-Din additionally restored or rebuilt the two mosques and donated an elaborate wooden mihrab (prayer niche) to the Mosque of Abraham. Several famous crusaders were imprisoned in the citadel, among them Count of Edessa, Joscelin II, who died there, Raynald of Châtillon, and the King of Jerusalem, Baldwin II, who was held for two years.

The Nur al-Din Madrasa is a funerary madrasa in Damascus, Syria. It was built in 1167 by Nūr ad-Dīn Zangī, atabeg of Syria, who is buried there. The complex includes a mosque, a madrasa, and the mausoleum of the founder. It was the first such complex to be built in Damascus. The Nur al-Din Bimaristan is a large Muslim medieval &quot;bimaristan&quot; (&quot;hospital&quot;) in Damascus, Syria. It was built and named after the Nur ad-Din Zangi in 1154.

The Great Mosque of al-Nuri, Mosul was also built by Nur ad-Din Zangi in 1172–1173, shortly before his death.

==Christianity under the Zengids==
Christianity in the Middle East continued to suffer a general decline within a context of Arabization and Islamization, as well as the conflict of the Crusades. Still, Syriac Christianity remained active under the Zengids, and even went through a phase of &quot;Syriac Renaissance&quot; in which discriminatory rules against Christians were lifted, especially after the death of the conservative Nur al-Din Zengi in 1174. Several important Christian manuscripts were created in Mosul during the late Zengid period, especially under the atabagate of Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; (1211–1234), and later during his independent reign (1234–1259). One of them, the Jacobite-Syrian Lectionary of the Gospels, was created at the Mar Mattai Monastery 20 kilometers northeast of the city of Mosul, c.1220 (Vatican Library, Ms. Syr. 559). This Gospel, with its depiction of many military figures in armour, is considered as a useful reference of the military technologies of classical Islam during the period. Another such gospel is Ms. Additional 7170, British Library, also created circa 1220 in the Mosul region.

==Zengid rulers==
The Zengids branched out in several regions between Syria and Iraq.

===Zengid Atabegs and Emirs of Mosul===

* Zengi, 1127–1146
* Sayf al-Din Ghazi I, son of Zengi, 1146–1149
* Qutb al-Din Mawdud, son of Zengi, 1149–1170

<text>Wakeskating is a water sport and an adaptation of wakeboarding that employs a similar design of board manufactured from maple or fibreglass. Unlike wakeboarding, the rider is not bound to the board in any way, similar to the skateboard, from which the name derives.

== Design ==
Fins are constructed of plastic, fiberglass or aluminum. Shorter fins must be deeper to get the same amount of tracking. A shallower fin does not track as well as a deeper one. But a deeper fin has more drag in the water, and does not release from the water as fast.

Wakeskating shoes are designed with quick drying materials and drainage channels. The drainage channels are a system of holes in the sole and channels through the midsole.
Most wakeskate boards are made with grip tape on the upper side like skateboards. The grip tape is like sandpaper; it helps the rider to stay on the board and provides good traction, and is the main reason why rider wears shoes. Some boards are made with a foam instead of grip-tape, and can be ridden barefoot; the foam is easier on the skin than grip tape in case of a fall.

== History ==
Wakeskating was pioneered by Thomas Horrell in the United States. Wakeskating has become urbanized due to the advent of the &quot;winch&quot;, a mechanical device with a small horizontal shaft engine that holds a spool of rope and pulls the rope at riding speed.

Wakeskates are characterised by five parameters: size, material, deck shape, deck surface and rocker type.

==Size==

The appropriate length for a wakeskate depends on the rider&#x27;s weight. A 39-inch wakeskate is suitable for a 180-pound rider. A wakeskate 41 or more inches long is best for a riders weighing 250 pounds or more. Shorter, lighter wakeskates are easy to maneuver and can be easily flicked, but they are comparatively unstable as the rider lands on the surface of the water. Larger wakeskates with more surface area are more stable.

==Material==

Wakeskate may be made of wood, or a composite material. A wood wakeskate consists of a wooden skate coated with marine-grade epoxy that gives it a finished look and prolongs its life. However, wooden wakeskates do not last as long as composite ones as the wood degrades with constant exposure to water, and do not usually have a manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.

More expensive composite wakeskates, made of synthetic materials that do not degrade quickly with exposure to water, are more popular especially among professional riders because of their lighter weight and longer life.

<text>The Eurasian bittern or great bittern (Botaurus stellaris) is a wading bird in the bittern subfamily (Botaurinae) of the heron family Ardeidae. There are two subspecies, the northern race (&quot;B. s. stellaris&quot;) breeding in parts of Europe and across the Palearctic, as well as on the northern coast of Africa, while the southern race (&quot;B. s. capensis&quot;) is endemic to parts of southern Africa. It is a secretive bird, seldom seen in the open as it prefers to skulk in reed beds and thick vegetation near water bodies. Its presence is apparent in the spring, when the booming call of the male during the breeding season can be heard. It feeds on fish, small mammals, fledgling birds, amphibians, crustaceans and insects.

The nest is usually built among reeds at the edge of bodies of water. The female incubates the clutch of eggs and feeds the young chicks, which leave the nest when about two weeks old. She continues to care for them until they are fully fledged some six weeks later.

With its specific habitat requirements and the general reduction in wetlands across its range, the population is thought to be in decline globally. However the decline is slow, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its overall conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;. Nevertheless, some local populations are at risk and the population of the southern race has declined more dramatically and is cause for concern. In the United Kingdom it is one of the most threatened of all bird species.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
This species was first described as &quot;Ardea asteria sive stellaris&quot; as early as 1603 by Ulisse Aldrovandi in his Ornithologiae. In 1660 the ornithologist Thomas Browne referred to it as &quot;Ardea stellaris botaurus&quot; and then the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; of 1758 named it again as &quot;Ardea stellaris&quot;. It is placed in the subfamily Botaurinae, and its closest relatives are the American bittern (&quot;Botaurus lentiginosus&quot;), the pinnated bittern (&quot;Botaurus pinnatus&quot;) and the Australasian bittern (&quot;Botaurus poiciloptilus&quot;). Two races of Eurasian bittern are recognised; the nominate subspecies &quot;B. s. stellaris&quot; has a palearctic distribution and occurs across a broad swathe of Europe, North Africa and Asia, while the other subspecies, &quot;B. s. capensis&quot;, occurs only in southern Africa. The name &quot;capensis&quot; was used for species found in the Afrotropics for which no exact range was known.

The generic name &quot;Botaurus&quot; was given by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens, and is derived from Medieval Latin &quot;butaurus&quot;, &quot;bittern&quot;, itself constructed from the Middle English name for the bird, &quot;botor&quot;. Pliny gave a fanciful derivation from &quot;Bos&quot; (ox) and &quot;taurus&quot; (bull), because the bittern&#x27;s call resembles the bellowing of a bull. The species name &quot;stellaris&quot; is Latin for &quot;starred&quot;, from &quot;stella&quot;, &quot;star&quot;, and refers to the speckled plumage.

Its folk names, often local, include many variations on the themes of &quot;barrel-maker&quot;, &quot;bog-bull&quot;, &quot;bog hen&quot;, &quot;bog-trotter&quot;, &quot;bog-bumper&quot;, &quot;mire drum[ble]&quot;, &quot;butter bump&quot;, &quot;bitter bum&quot;, &quot;bog blutter&quot;, &quot;bog drum&quot;, &quot;boom bird&quot;, &quot;bottle-bump&quot;, &quot;bull of the bog&quot;, &quot;bull of the mire&quot;, &quot;bumpy cors&quot;, and &quot;heather blutter&quot;. Most of these were onomatopoeic colloquial names for the bird; the call was described as &quot;bumping&quot; or &quot;booming&quot;. Mire and bog denote the bird&#x27;s habitat.

==Description==

Bitterns are thickset herons with bright, pale, buffy-brown plumage covered with dark streaks and bars. As its alternative name suggests, this species is the largest of the bitterns, with males being rather larger than females. The Eurasian or great bittern is in length, with a wingspan and a body mass of .

The crown and nape are black, with the individual feathers rather long and loosely arranged, tipped with buff narrowly barred with black. The sides of the head and neck are a more uniform tawny-buff, irregularly barred with black. The mantle, scapulars and back are of a similar colour but are more heavily barred, the individual feathers having black centres and barring. The head has a yellowish-buff superciliary stripe and a brownish-black moustachial stripe. The sides of the neck are a rusty-brown with faint barring. The chin and throat are buff, the central feathers on the throat having longitudinal stripes of rusty-brown. The breast and belly are yellowish-buff, with broad stripes of brown at the side and narrow stripes in the centre. The tail is rusty-buff with black streaks in the centre and black mottling near the edge. The wings are pale rusty-brown irregularly barred, streaked and mottled with black. The plumage has a loose texture, and elongated feathers on the crown, neck and breast can be erected. The powerful bill is greenish-yellow with a darker tip to the upper mandible. The eye has a yellow iris and is surrounded by a ring of greenish or bluish bare skin. The legs and feet are greenish, with some yellow on the tarsal joint and yellow soles to the feet. Juveniles have similar plumage to adults but are somewhat paler with less distinct markings.

==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding range of &quot;B. s. stellaris&quot; extends across temperate parts of Europe and Asia from the British Isles, Sweden and Finland eastwards to Sakhalin Island in eastern Siberia, Korea and Hokkaido Island in Japan. The bird&#x27;s northern extent of occurrence is around 57°N in the Ural Mountains and 64°N in eastern Siberia. Its southern limit is the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, Iran, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Hebei Province in northern China. Small resident populations also breed in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. It typically inhabits reed beds (&quot;Phragmites&quot;) and swamps, as well as lakes, lagoons and sluggish rivers fringed by rank vegetation. It sometimes nests by ponds in agricultural areas, and even quite near habitations where suitable habitat exists, but for preference, chooses large reed beds of at least in which to breed.

Some populations are sedentary and stay in the same areas throughout the year. More northerly populations usually migrate to warmer regions but some birds often remain; birds in northern Europe tend to move south and west to southern Europe, northern and central Africa, and northern Asian birds migrate to parts of the Arabian peninsula, the Indian sub-continent, and the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Inner Mongolia in eastern China. Outside the breeding season it has less restrictive habitat requirements, and as well as living in reed beds, it visits rice fields, watercress beds, fish farms, gravel pits, sewage works, ditches, flooded areas and marshes.

The subspecies &quot;B. s. capensis&quot; is endemic to southern Africa, where it is found sparingly in marshes near the east coast, the Okavango Delta and the upland foothills of the Drakensberg Mountains. This population is sedentary..In November 2024 it was seen in Wular Lake for the first time in The history of Kashmir.

==Behaviour==

Usually solitary, the Eurasian bittern forages in reed beds, walking stealthily or remaining still above a body of water where prey may occur. It is a shy bird, and if disturbed, often points its bill directly upwards and freezes in that position, causing its cryptic plumage to blend into the surrounding reeds, an action known as &quot;bitterning&quot;. While in this position, the shield of elongated feathers on throat and breast droop downwards and hide the neck, so that the outline of the head and body is obscured. Sometimes it resorts to applying powder down produced by patches of specialist down feathers at the side of its breast. This white dusty material seems to help it to rid its head and neck of slime after feeding on eels. It then removes the excess powder by scratching vigorously before applying preen oil from the gland at the base of its tail.

The bird has a secretive nature, keeping largely hidden in the reeds and coarse vegetation. Occasionally, especially in hard winter weather, it stands in the open beside the water&#x27;s edge, although usually close to cover to facilitate a hasty retreat. In flight, its wings can be seen to be broad and rounded, and its legs trail behind it in typical heron fashion. Its neck is extended when it takes off, but is retracted when it has picked up speed. It seldom flies however, except when feeding young, preferring to move through the vegetation stealthily on foot. Its gait is slow and deliberate and it can clamber over reeds by gripping several at a time with its toes. It is most active at dawn and dusk, but also sometimes forages by day.

Eurasian bitterns feed on fish, small mammals, amphibians and invertebrates, hunting along the reed margins in shallow water. British records include eels up to and other fish, mice and voles, small birds and fledglings, frogs, newts, crabs, shrimps, molluscs, spiders and insects. In continental Europe, members of over twenty families of beetle are eaten, as well as dragonflies, bees, grasshoppers and earwigs. Some vegetable matter such as aquatic plants is also consumed.

Males are polygamous, mating with up to five females. The nest is built in the previous year&#x27;s standing reeds and consists of an untidy platform some across. It may be on a tussock surrounded by water or on matted roots close to water and is built by the female using bits of reed, sedges and grass stalks, with a lining of finer fragments. The eggs average in size and are non-glossy, olive-brown, with some darker speckling at the broader end. Four to six eggs are laid in late March and April and incubated by the female for about twenty-six days. After hatching, the chicks spend about two weeks in the nest before leaving to swim amongst the reeds. The female rears them without help from the male, regurgitating food into the nest from her crop, the young seizing her bill and pulling it down. They become fully fledged at about eight weeks.

===Voice===

The mating call or contact call of the male is a deep, sighing fog-horn or bull-like &quot;boom&quot; with a quick rise and an only slightly longer fall, easily audible from a distance of on a calm night. The call is mainly given between January and April during the mating season. Surveys of Eurasian bitterns are carried out by noting the number of distinct male booms in a given area. Prior to modern science, it was unknown how such a small bird produced a call so low-pitched: common explanations included that the bird made its call into a straw or that it blew directly into the water. It is now known that the sound is produced by expelling air from the oesophagus with the aid of powerful muscles surrounding it.

==Status==

The Eurasian bittern has a very wide range and a large total population, estimated to be 110,000 to 340,000 individuals. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its overall conservation status as being of &quot;least concern because although the population trend is downward, the rate of decline is insufficient to justify rating it in a more threatened category. The chief threat the bird faces is destruction of reed beds and drainage and disturbance of its wetland habitats. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. The southern race has suffered catastrophic decline during the 20th century due to wetland degradation and, unlike the northern race, is of high conservation concern.

In the United Kingdom the species became extinct in the late 1800s, and was not recorded to successfully breed again until 1911. The population increased to c.70 pairs in the 1950s, before dwindling to less than 20 pairs in the late 1990s. In 1997 there were 11 males and by 2007 an estimated 44 breeding pairs, concentrated mainly in Lancashire and East Anglia. In 2021, 228 breeding males were counted in the United Kingdom, an increase of 19 birds since 2019. The Lancashire population at Leighton Moss RSPB reserve declined in recent decades, while bitterns have been attracted to new reed beds in the West Country. After extensive reedbed restoration, nesting and breeding was observed in north Wales, while in 2020, two pairs successfully bred at Newport Wetlands in Gwent, south Wales. These were the first bitterns to breed in the county in some 250 years. In the 21st century, bitterns are regular winter visitors to the London Wetland Centre, enabling city dwellers to view these scarce birds. In Ireland, it died out as a breeding species in the mid-19th century, but in 2011 a single bird was spotted in County Wexford and there have been a number of subsequent sightings.

==In literature==

Thomas Bewick records that the bittern &quot;was formerly held in much estimation at the tables of the great&quot;.

===Booming===

The Eurasian bittern is proposed as one of rational explanations behind the drekavac, a creature of the graveyard and darkness originating in south Slavic mythology. It is mentioned in the short story &quot;Brave Mita and Drekavac from the Pond&quot; by Branko Ćopić.

The 18th-century Scottish poet James Thomson refers to the bittern&#x27;s &quot;boom&quot; in his poem &quot;Spring&quot; (written 1728), published as part of his &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1735):

The species is mentioned in George Crabbe&#x27;s 1810 narrative poem &quot;The Borough&quot;, to emphasise the ostracised, solitary life of the poem&#x27;s villain, Peter Grimes:

The Irish poet Thomas MacDonagh translated the Gaelic poem &quot;The Yellow Bittern&quot; (&quot;An Bonnán Buí&quot; in Irish) by Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna. His friend, the poet Francis Ledwidge, wrote a &quot;Lament for Thomas MacDonagh&quot; with the opening line &quot;He shall not hear the bittern cry&quot;.

In the Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the naturalist Stapleton proposes the boom of a bittern as an explanation for the howl attributed to the mystical hound.

Because of its secretive and skulking nature, it was for long unclear exactly how the bittern produced its distinctive booming call. A Mediaeval theory held that the bittern thrust its beak into the boggy ground of the marsh in which it lived, making its vocalization which was amplified and deepened as it reverberated through the water. A reference to this theory appears in 1476 in Chaucer&#x27;s The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale, lines 972-73: 

The English 17th century physician Sir Thomas Browne disputed this claim, stating in his &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;, Book III, Ch.27: &quot;That a Bittor maketh that mugient noise, or as we term it Bumping, by putting its bill into a reed as most believe, or as &quot;Bellonius&quot; and &quot;Aldrovandus&quot; conceive, by putting the same in water or mud, and after a while retaining the air by suddenly excluding it again, is not so easily made out. For my own part, though after diligent enquiry, I could never behold them in this motion&quot;. Browne even kept a captive bittern to discover how its &quot;boom&quot; was produced.

===Camouflage===
The artist Abbott Handerson Thayer argued in &quot;Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom&quot; that animals were concealed by a combination of countershading and disruptive coloration, which together &quot;obliterated&quot; their self-shadowing and their shape. However, Thayer&#x27;s conclusions have been disputed.

The zoologist Hugh Cott, in his classic 1940 study of camouflage, &quot;Adaptive Coloration in Animals&quot;, cites William Palmer&#x27;s account of seeing a bittern:

<text>The United States Social Security Administration (SSA) is an independent agency of the U.S. federal government that administers Social Security, a social insurance program consisting of retirement, disability and survivor benefits. 
The Social Security Administration was established by the Social Security Act of 1935 and is codified in (). It was created in 1935 as the &quot;Social Security Board&quot;, then assumed its present name in 1946. Its current leader is Leland Dudek (acting).

SSA offers its services to the public through 1,200 field offices, a website, and a national toll-free number. Field offices, which served 43 million individuals in 2019, were reopened on April 7, 2022 after being closed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

SSA is headquartered in Woodlawn, Maryland, just to the west of Baltimore, at what is known as Central Office. In addition to its 1,200 field offices, the agency includes 10 regional offices, eight processing centers, and 37 Teleservice Centers. , about 60,000 people were employed by SSA. Headquarters non-supervisory employees of SSA are represented by American Federation of Government Employees Local 1923.

SSA operates the largest government program in the United States. In fiscal year (FY) 2022, the agency expects to pay out $1.2 trillion in Social Security benefits to 66 million individuals. In addition, SSA expects to pay $61 billion in SSI benefits to 7.5 million low-income individuals in FY 2022.

To qualify for most of these benefits, most workers pay Social Security taxes on their earnings; the claimant&#x27;s benefits are based on the wage earner&#x27;s contributions. Otherwise benefits such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are given based on need.

== History ==

The Social Security Act created a Social Security Board (SSB), to oversee the administration of the new program. It was created as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal with the signing of the Social Security Act of 1935 on August 14, 1935. The Board consisted of three presidentially appointed executives, and started with no budget, no staff, and no furniture. It obtained a temporary budget from the Federal Emergency Relief Administration headed by Harry Hopkins. The first counsel for the new agency was Thomas Elliott, one of Felix Frankfurter&#x27;s &quot;happy hot dogs&quot;.

The first Social Security office opened in Austin, Texas, on October 14, 1936. Social Security taxes were first collected in January 1937, along with the first one-time, lump-sum payments. The first person to receive monthly retirement benefits was Ida May Fuller of Brattleboro, Vermont. Her first check, dated January 31, 1940, was in the amount of US$22.54.

In 1939, the Social Security Board merged into a cabinet-level Federal Security Agency, which included the SSB, the U.S. Public Health Service, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and other agencies. In January 1940, the first regular ongoing monthly benefits began. 
In 1946, the SSB was renamed the Social Security Administration under President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s Reorganization Plan.

In 1953, the Federal Security Agency was abolished and SSA was placed under the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, which became the Department of Health and Human Services in 1980. In 1994, Congress amended non-positive law and returned SSA to the status of an independent agency in the executive branch of government. In 1972, Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) were introduced into SSA programs to deal with the effects of inflation on fixed incomes.

In 1960, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Flemming v. Nestor&quot; that the Social Security is not a system of &#x27;accrued property rights&#x27; and that those who pay into the system have no contractual right to receive what they have paid into it.

== Headquarters ==

SSA was one of the first federal agencies to have its national headquarters outside of Washington, D.C., or its adjacent suburbs. It was located in Baltimore initially due to the need for a building that was capable of holding the unprecedented amount of paper records that would be needed. Nothing suitable was available in Washington in 1936, so the Social Security Board selected the Candler Building on Baltimore&#x27;s harbor as a temporary location. Soon after locating there, construction began on a permanent building for SSA in Washington that would meet their requirements for record storage capacity. However, by the time the new building was completed, World War II had started, and the building was commandeered by the War Department. By the time the war ended, it was judged too disruptive to relocate the agency to Washington. The Agency remained in the Candler Building until 1960, when it relocated to its newly built headquarters in Woodlawn.
The road on which the headquarters is located, built especially for SSA, is named Security Boulevard (Maryland Route 122) and has since become one of the major arteries connecting Baltimore with its western suburbs. Security Boulevard is also the name of SSA&#x27;s exit from the nearby Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695). A nearby shopping center has been named Security Square Mall, and Woodlawn is often referred to informally as &quot;Security.&quot; Interstate 70, which runs for thousands of miles from Utah to Maryland, terminates in a park and ride lot that adjoins the SSA campus.

Due to space constraints and ongoing renovations, many headquarters employees work in leased space throughout the Woodlawn area. Other SSA components are located elsewhere. For example, the headquarters (also known as Central Office) of SSA&#x27;s Office of Disability Adjudication and Review is located in Falls Church, Virginia.

== Field offices ==
SSA has a network of more than 1,200 community-based field offices. In fiscal year 2019, 43 million individuals visited these field offices to apply for benefits, get an original or replacement Social Security card, or receive other services. Field offices reopened in April 2022, after being closed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

SSA provides a field office locator service, where members of the public can find office phone numbers and addresses.

SSA also provides services through a national toll-free number (1-800-772-1213) and a website. Retirement and disability benefits can be applied for online. For survivor benefits, however, members of the public must call or visit SSA in person to apply. In most states, individuals seeking a replacement Social Security card can apply for one online.

Members of the public can also apply for Supplemental Security Income at SSA&#x27;s field offices. Field office staff will also assist SSI applicants with an application for food assistance through the SNAP program.

== Program Service Centers ==


Much of the actual processing of initial benefits and subsequent adjustments to benefits is done in six large Program Service Centers located around the country.

The two main positions in Program Service Centers have long been Claims Authorizers and Benefits Authorizers. Claims Authorizers, now sometimes called claims specialists, establish initial benefits for program recipients. Benefits Authorizers process complicated changes of entitlements to existing beneficiaries, including life events, overpayments, underpayments, and so forth. The claims position is the higher-ranking of the two and initially required a college degree whereas the post-entitlement position did not. For decades, post-entitlement actions have been processed through a system known as Manual Adjustment, Credit and Award Processes (MADCAP).

The six service centers are:

* Northeastern Program Service Center, Jamaica, Queens, New York (as of late 1980s; previously in Rego Park, Queens and College Point, Queens)
* Mid-Atlantic Program Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
* Southeastern Program Service Center, Birmingham, Alabama
* Great Lakes Program Service Center, Chicago, Illinois
* Mid-America Program Service Center, Kansas City, Missouri
* Western Program Service Center, Richmond, California (as of mid 1970s; previously in San Francisco)

They have been located in these six cities going back to at least the early 1950s.
The origins of the payment centers date back to 1942, when they were known as Area Offices. The first one was established in Philadelphia, with ones in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and New Orleans, Louisiana, soon following.

In addition, there are specialized processing centers for the Office of Earnings and International Operations and the Office of Disability Operations, both located in Baltimore.


Before the mid-1970s, the Program Service Centers were called Payment Centers. By the late 1960s, the Payment Centers had acquired a reputation as sources of poor bureaucratic performance that people did not want to work in, and a reorganization under a modules system was undertaken during the 1970s in an effort to improve matters. Each module would be assigned a certain block of social security numbers and it would process all aspects of a claim, from initial entitlement through various changes, notifications to beneficiaries, and so forth. Decades later, the modules system was still seen as one of the great improvements in SSA processing.

The centers have each employed around two thousand people or more, giving them a major local economic impact, and even relocations within the same metropolitan area have created political conflict.
When in the early 1970s, SSA and the General Services Administration said it intended to move payment center operations out of San Francisco and across the East Bay to Richmond, the move was opposed by San Francisco-representing Congressman Phillip Burton. 
Burton&#x27;s efforts were in vain, however, as construction in a redevelopment area in Richmond commenced and the move was made around 1975.

Similarly, in the late 1970s, SSA, the General Services Administration, and the Carter administration devised a plan to move the program service center from its main location, in two leased buildings on Horace Harding Expressway in Lefrak City in Rego Park, to a new federal building planned for a revitalization zone in the center of the Jamaica area of Queens. The move was championed by Congressman Joseph P. Addabbo, who represented Jamaica and whose district would gain the over 2,000 federal workers involved, but was opposed by Congressman Benjamin Rosenthal, whose district would lose them. According to Rosenthal, the potential negative impact of the move affected the Elmhurst and Corona neighborhoods most strongly.
The move was also supported by Representative Geraldine Ferraro, another powerful Queens figure, who sat on the House Public Works Committee.
The dispute was aired in Congressional hearings and embroiled Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and developer Richard Lefrak, supporting and opposing the move respectively, as well.
In the event, the move went forward and the new, 11-story building in Jamaica – by then named the Joseph P. Addabbo Federal Building, as the congressman had died in the interim – opened in 1988.

== Coverage ==

Initially, only 56 percent of the jobs in the United States were covered by Social Security. Today, the system is nearly universal, with 94 percent of individuals in paid employment in the United States working in covered employment.

State and local government workers are not required to participate in the Social Security program if they participate in a public retirement system through their employers. However, state and local governments, through agreements known as Section 218 agreements, may elect to participate in the program. Of the 23.2 million state and local workers in the United States, about 6.6 million are not covered by Social Security. Other workers not covered by Social Security include federal employees hired before 1984, railroad workers, some family employees, some students, and some members of the clergy.

If a job is not covered by Social Security, workers and employers do not pay Social Security payroll taxes. Social Security retirement and disability benefits are not payable unless individuals have sufficient work in Social Security covered employment. Individuals who work part of their careers in covered employment and part of their careers in non-covered employment and who receive pensions from non-covered employment may have their Social Security benefits reduced through the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) or the Government Pension Offset (GPO). 

Railroad workers were covered by the Railroad Retirement Board before Social Security was founded. Today, they still are, though a portion of each railroad pension is designated as &quot;equivalent&quot; to Social Security. Railroad workers also participate in Medicare. All state and local government employees hired since 1986, or who are covered by Section 218 Agreements, participate in Medicare even if not covered for purposes of Social Security benefits.

=== Old age, survivors and disability ===
SSA administers the retirement, survivors, and disabled social insurance programs, which can provide monthly benefits to aged or disabled workers, their spouses and children, and to the survivors of insured workers. In 2010, more than 54 million Americans received approximately $712 billion in Social Security benefits. The programs are primarily financed by taxes which employers, employees, and the self-insured pay annually. These revenues are placed into a special trust fund. These programs are collectively known as Retirement, Survivors, Disability Insurance (RSDI).

SSA administers its disability program partly through its Office of Hearing Operations (OHO), which has regional offices and hearing offices across the United States. OHO processes claims that have been appealed from the first (in prototype states) or second unfavorable determination through the state-based Disability Determination Services (DDS) who develop and process claims at the initial and reconsideration levels of review. OHO runs offices for the approximately 1,200 Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) who develop, evaluate, and adjudicate appellate claims and provide substantive hearings for claimants to obtain testimony and expert evidence prior to issuing a hearing decision with findings of fact and law regarding each claim. OHO publishes a procedural manual called the Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual (HALLEX) which &quot;defines procedures for carrying out policy and provides guidance for processing and adjudicating claims&quot; for OHO, the Appeals Council (AC), the Division of Civil Actions (DCA) levels. &quot;It also includes policy statements resulting from Appeals Council &quot;en banc&quot; meetings under the authority of the Appeals Council Chair.&quot;

The RSDI program is the primary benefits program administered by the U.S. federal government, and for some beneficiaries is the vital source of income. Increasing access to this benefit program for low-income or homeless individuals is one of SSA&#x27;s goals. SSA is a member of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and works with other municipal, county, state, local and federal partners to increase access and approval for SSI/SSDI benefits who are eligible.

=== Supplemental Security Income (SSI) ===
SSA also administers the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which is needs-based, for the aged, blind, or disabled. Prior to the 1972 Amendments to the Social Security Act, low-income aged, blind, or disabled persons received benefits from state-run programs called Old-Age Assistance, Aid to the Blind, and Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled. These programs received federal funding, but varied in terms of eligibility requirements and benefit payments. The 1972 Amendments replaced these programs with the SSI program. SSA was assigned responsibility for the SSI program and began operations in 1974. Federal benefit payments up to $943 for an SSI individual and $1,371 for an SSI couple are available from the program. SSI benefits are paid out of the general revenue of the United States of America. Some states supplement the federal amount. 

Because SSI is needs-based, eligibility is restricted to persons with limited income and resources. In addition, eligibility is generally restricted to U.S. citizens, nationals, and some other groups (such as some refugees) who reside in one of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, or the Northern Mariana Islands. U.S. citizens and nationals who reside in American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are not eligible for SSI. In 2019, 8 million individuals received SSI, including 1.1 million disabled children, 4.6 million disabled adults, and 2.3 million persons 65 or older.

In some cases, individuals may be eligible for Social Security (RSDI) benefits and SSI benefits. For example, a disabled individual who worked in Social Security-covered employment and who has limited income and resources may receive a Social Security disability benefit (due to employment prior to disability) and a partial SSI benefit (due to limited income and resources). SSA refers to these beneficiaries as &quot;concurrent&quot; beneficiaries.

===Medicare===
The administration of the Medicare program is a responsibility of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but SSA offices are used for determining initial eligibility, some processing of premium payments, and for limited public contact information. They also administer a financial needs-based program called Extra Help, which helps beneficiaries pay the premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance associated with prescription drug coverage under Part D of Medicare. Benefits under this program are estimated to be worth about $5,000 per year. Individuals may apply online for the Extra Help program or by calling SSA.

==Operations==
To ensure consistent and efficient treatment of Social Security beneficiaries across its organization, SSA has compiled a book known as the Program Operations Manual System (POMS) which governs practically all aspects of SSA&#x27;s internal operations. POMS describes, in detail, a variety of situations regularly encountered by SSA personnel, and the exact policies and procedures that apply to each situation.

===Automation===

While the establishment of Social Security predated the invention of the modern digital computer, punched card data processing was a mature technology, and the Social Security system made extensive use of automated unit record equipment from the program&#x27;s inception. This allowed the Social Security Administration to achieve a high level of efficiency. SSA expenses have always been a small fraction of benefits paid. As a percentage of assets, the administration costs are 0.39%.

===Adjudication===
SSA operates its own administrative adjudication system, which has original jurisdiction when claims are denied in part or in full. SSA decisions are issued by Administrative Law Judges and Senior Attorney Adjudicators (supported by about 6,000 staff employees) at locations throughout the United States of the U.S. Office of Hearing Operations, formerly Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR), who hear and decide challenges to SSA decisions. Dissatisfied claimants can appeal to ODAR&#x27;s Appeals Council, and if still dissatisfied can appeal to a U.S. District Court.

Over the years, OHO aka ODAR has developed its own procedural system, which is documented in the Hearings and Appeals Litigation Law Manual (HALLEX)
(HALLEX). ODAR was formerly known as the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) and, prior to the 1970s, the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. The name was changed to ODAR in 2007 to reflect the fact that about 75% of the agency&#x27;s docket consists of disability cases. OHO aka ODAR also adjudicates disputes relating to retirement claims and has jurisdiction when the paternity of a claimant or the validity of a marriage is at issue when a claim is filed for benefits under the earnings record of a spouse or parent. The agency also adjudicates a limited number of Medicare claim issues, which is a residual legacy from when SSA was part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

===Statistical publications===
Each year, just before Mother&#x27;s Day, SSA releases a list of the names most commonly given to newborn babies in the United States in the previous year, based on applications for Social Security cards. The report includes the 1,000 most common names for both genders. The Popular Baby Names page on the SSA website provides the complete list and allows searches for past years and particular names. For privacy reasons, SSA does not publish data for names with fewer than five occurrences in any given year.

<text>Bitterns are birds belonging to the subfamily Botaurinae of the heron family Ardeidae. Bitterns tend to be shorter-necked and more secretive than other members of the family. They were called &quot;hæferblæte&quot; and various iterations of &quot;raredumla&quot; in Old English; the word &quot;bittern&quot; came to English from Old French &quot;butor&quot;, itself from Gallo-Roman &quot;butitaurus&quot;, a compound of Latin &quot;būtiō&quot; (buzzard) and &quot;taurus&quot; (bull).

Bitterns usually frequent reed beds and similar marshy areas and feed on amphibians, reptiles, insects, and fish.

Bitterns, like herons, egrets, and pelicans, fly with their necks retracted, unlike the cranes, storks, ibises and spoonbills, and geese which fly with necks extended and outstretched. The genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was recently found to be paraphyletic with the &quot;Botaurus&quot; genus, and &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was then merged into &quot;Botaurus&quot;.

== Species ==
There are currently 14 extant species divided into two genera within Botaurinae:

<doc id="220011" wikidata="Q7984306" url="?curid=220011" title="West American Digest System">
<text>The West American Digest System is a system of identifying points of law from reported cases and organizing them by topic and key number. The system was developed by West Publishing to organize the entire body of American law. This extensive taxonomy makes the process of doing case law legal research less time consuming as it directs the researcher to cases that are similar to the legal issue under consideration.

==History==

The problem of finding cases on a particular topic was a large problem for the rapidly growing American legal system of the 19th century. John B. West, the founder of West Publishing, described this problem in his article &quot;A multiplicity of reports&quot;. To solve the problem, he developed a system with two major parts. First, his company began to regularly publish cases from many American jurisdictions in bound volumes called reporters (the West National Reporter System now covers all state and federal appellate courts, as well as certain trial courts). Second, he put together a classification system in which he divided the law into major categories which he called topics (such as &quot;Contracts&quot;). He then created hundreds of subcategories. To save space in printing, these were given a number called a key number. He then applied this &quot;topic and key number&quot; system to the cases he published. The key number is identified in the books with a key number and a key symbol graphic. 

John West was not the original creator of the digest system which now bears his name; it predates the creation of the National Reporter System. In 1847, Little, Brown and Company started to publish the &quot;United States Digest&quot;, a digest of all state and federal case law since 1790. In 1870, Little, Brown hired brothers Benjamin and Austin Abbott to start over and prepare a new series of the &quot;United States Digest&quot; from scratch. Then in 1889, West Publishing Company acquired Abbott&#x27;s &quot;United States Digest&quot; from Little, Brown, renamed it the &quot;American Digest&quot; in 1890, and hired John A. Mallory to &quot;build upon Abbott&#x27;s improvements in law digesting&quot;. In 1909, West Publishing began to aggressively market its system of topic and key numbering as the West Key Number System.
Since then, to reinforce how West digests and reporters are intended to be used together for legal research, the printed volumes of reporters in the National Reporter System are traditionally marked by a &quot;West Key Number System&quot; logo on their spines. (The key depicted is somewhat cartoonish, in that it has too many teeth to be used in a typical pin tumbler lock.)

At the encouragement of the American Bar Association, West also licensed the West Key Number System &quot;to nearly every independently published state digest&quot;, and invited writers of treatises and textbooks to include West key numbers in their publications.

==How it works==
Each case published in a West reporter is evaluated by a West &quot;attorney-editor&quot; who identifies and summarizes the points of law cited or explained in the case. The attorney-editor places the summaries of the points of law covered in the case at the beginning of the case. These summaries are usually a paragraph long, and are called headnotes. Each headnote is then assigned a topic and key number. The headnotes are arranged according to their topic and key number in multi-volume sets of books called Digests. A digest serves as a subject index to the case law published in West reporters. Headnotes are merely editorial guides to the points of law discussed or used in the cases, and the headnotes themselves are not legal authority.

West publishes &quot;West&#x27;s Analysis of American Law&quot;, which is a complete guide to the topic and key number system, and it is revised periodically.

==Print digest==
In print, a digest works like an encyclopedia, in that the topics are listed in alphabetical order and printed on the spines. The &quot;Descriptive Word Index&quot; provides guidance as to the proper topics and key numbers.

The digest system includes digests for the individual states (except for Delaware, Nevada and Utah). The U.S. Supreme Court, the Court of Federal Claims, bankruptcy courts, and military courts each have an individual digest, and all their decisions are also included in the Federal Practice Digest together with the notes of decisions from the federal District Courts and Courts of Appeals. Digests are also published for West&#x27;s National Reporter System. Specialty subject digests exist, such as the Education Law Digest, and the Social Security Digest.

For nationwide research, about once a month, West publishes a General Digest volume, which incorporates classified digest notes from all reporters of the West National Reporter System. These are then cumulated into a Decennial Digest. Decennial implies that this occurs every ten years, but in the past several decades, there have been Decennial Digest Parts I and II (the 11th Series now has Part III, so the cumulation is now more frequent. However, the various Decennial Digests are not cumulated. Thus, completing such a search over several decades requires consulting the Decennial Digests, and then updating that work with the most recent series of the General Digest.

Some of the state and topical digests are revised to include the first cases in the jurisdiction, while the spines of the books of some of the other digests indicate that they are from &quot;1933 to date,&quot; for instance, indicating that one must consult a prior series for references to earlier cases. The state, federal, regional, and topical digests are updated by interim pamphlets, pocket parts, replacement volumes, or a new series.

==The Digest on Westlaw==
Researchers can also search the digest electronically using Westlaw:
* with the &quot;Key Number Search Tool&quot;, which uses a word search to identify up to five key numbers,
* with the &quot;Key Numbers and Digest&quot; feature (browse by subject using an expandable tree – no search terms required),
* by a key number search using the &quot;Terms and Connectors&quot; method (with a known topic and key number – in the form of 134k261; topic 134 is Divorce and the key number is 261 for &quot;Enforcement, In general&quot;),
* by using the KeySearch feature (a menu of hierarchical links that automatically generates a search without the need to see the key numbers or the terms and connectors query), or 
* by finding a relevant case using keyword searching and then using the key number hyperlinks in the document to find related cases.

Most secondary sources published by Thomson West, such as &quot;Corpus Juris Secundum&quot; and &quot;American Jurisprudence&quot;, also have key number hyperlinks in their online Westlaw versions.

The &quot;Key Numbers and Digest&quot; feature and the hyperlinks create a &quot;Custom Digest&quot;.

The Custom Digest allows:
* selection of the jurisdiction of interest (so that headnotes from cases in that jurisdiction will appear in the results);
* limiting the time frame of the search; and 
* adding additional search terms.

Selecting key numbers and jurisdictions in the &quot;Key Number Search Tool&quot; results in a similar display of digest headnotes.
Since all West headnote annotations are merged on Westlaw into a single database from which each Custom Digest is generated, there is no need to consult each separate series of the hard copy Decennial Digest. Full text of the cases may be accessed from the Custom Digest by clicking or activating the hyperlinks on the case citations. This will cause Westlaw to retrieve selected cases from a case law database, as long as the database is part of the user&#x27;s regular subscription plan.

== Other digest systems ==
Other digest systems exist, including Butterworth&#x27;s Digest for the United Kingdom (also containing references to cases decided in other Commonwealth countries), the Canadian Abridgment, digests associated with official state reports, such as in California and Wisconsin, and digests associated with topical reporters, such as the Uniform Commercial Code Case Digest. Most of these use a topic and section format, while some, like the U.C.C. Case Digest, use a section format based on the statute or rules being annotated. The A.L.R. Digest, accompanying the &quot;American Law Reports&quot;, formerly had its own classification system, but was replaced in 2004 by &quot;West&#x27;s American Law Reports Digest,&quot; which follows West&#x27;s topic and key number system.

<doc id="220016" wikidata="Q105967" url="?curid=220016" title="La Gomera">
<text>La Gomera () is one of Spain&#x27;s Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa. With an area of , it is the third-smallest of the archipelago&#x27;s eight main islands. It belongs to the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. La Gomera is the third least populous of the eight main Canary Islands, with 22,361 inhabitants at the start of 2023. Its capital is San Sebastián de La Gomera, where the &quot;cabildo insular&quot; (island council) is located.

==Political organisation==
La Gomera is part of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. It is divided into six municipalities:

The island government (&quot;cabildo insular&quot;) is in the capital, San Sebastián.

==Geography==
The island is of volcanic origin and roughly circular; it is about in diameter. It is very mountainous and steeply sloping and rises to at its highest peak, Alto de Garajonay. Its shape is rather like an orange that has been cut in half and then split into segments, which has left deep ravines or &quot;barrancos&quot; between them.

===Climate===
The lower altitudes of La Gomera fall into the desert climate zone, while the higher mountainous areas fall into the Mediterranean climate zone.
==Ecology==

The uppermost slopes of these &quot;barrancos&quot;, in turn, are covered by the &quot;laurisilva&quot; – or laurel rain forest, where up to 50 inches of precipitation fall each year.

The upper reaches of this densely wooded region are almost permanently shrouded in clouds and mist, and as a result are covered in lush and diverse vegetation. This area forms the protected environment of Spain&#x27;s Garajonay National Park, which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. The slopes are criss-crossed by trails of varying difficulty, offering views of the surrounding area.

The central mountains trap the moisture from the trade wind clouds and yield a temperate cloud forest climate, which contrasts with the warmer, sun-baked cliffs near sea level.

Between these extremes is a variety of microclimates. For centuries, La Gomera&#x27;s inhabitants have farmed the lower levels by channelling runoff water to irrigate their vineyards, orchards and banana groves.

==Natural symbols==

The official natural symbols associated with La Gomera are &quot;Columba junoniae&quot; (paloma rabiche) and &quot;Persea indica&quot; (viñátigo).

==Culture==
The local wine is distinctive and often accompanied with a &quot;tapa&quot; (snack) of local cheese, roasted pork, or goat meat. Other culinary specialities include almogrote, a cheese spread, miel de palma, a syrup extracted from palm trees, and &quot;escaldón&quot;, a porridge made with gofio flour.

La Gomera&#x27;s inhabitants have an ancient way of communicating across deep ravines by means of a whistled speech called &quot;Silbo Gomero&quot;, which can be heard two miles away. This whistled language is indigenous to the island, and its existence has been documented since Roman times. Invented by the original inhabitants of the island, the Guanches, &quot;Silbo Gomero&quot; was adopted by the Spanish settlers in the 16th century and survived after the Guanches were entirely assimilated. When it was threatened with extinction at the dawn of the 21st century, the local government required all children to learn it in school. Marcial Morera, a linguist at the University of La Laguna, has said that the study of silbo may help understand how languages are formed.

In the mountains of La Gomera, its original inhabitants worshipped their god, whom they called Orahan. The summit and centre of the island served as their sanctuary. Many natives took refuge in this sacred territory in 1489 as they faced imminent defeat at the hands of the Spaniards, and it was there that the conquest of La Gomera ended. Archaeologists have found ceremonial stone constructions there that appear to represent sacrificial altar stones, slate hollows, or cavities. It was there that the Guanches built pyres upon which to make offerings of goats and sheep to Orahan, who was known on La Palma as Abora and on Tenerife and Gran Canaria as Arocan. The Guanches also interred their dead in caves. Today, saints, who are worshipped through village festivals, are principally connected with Christianity. But in some aspects, the Guanches&#x27; godlike idealising of Gomeran uniqueness plays a role as well besides their pre-Christian and pre-colonial implication and shows strong local differences.

Christopher Columbus made La Gomera his last port of call before crossing the Atlantic in 1492 with his three ships, stopping to replenish his crew&#x27;s food and water supplies, intending to stay only four days. Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, the Countess of La Gomera and widow of Hernán Peraza the Younger, offered him vital support in preparations of the fleet, and he ended up staying one month. When he finally set sail on 6 September 1492, she gave him cuttings of sugarcane, which became the first to reach the New World. After his first voyage of Discovery, Columbus again provisioned his ships at the port of San Sebastián de La Gomera in 1493 on his second voyage to the New World, commanding a fleet of 17 vessels. He visited La Gomera for the last time in 1498 on his third voyage to the Americas. The house in San Sebastián in which he is reputed to have stayed is now a tourist attraction.

==Festivals==

The festival of the Virgin of Guadalupe, patron saint of the island, is the Monday following the first Saturday of October.

Every five years (most recently in 2023) is celebrated the &quot;Bajada de la Virgen de Guadalupe&quot; (the Bringing the Virgin) from her hermitage in Puntallana to the capital. She is brought by boat to the beach of San Sebastián de La Gomera, where several people host her, and transported throughout the island for two months.

<text>Thomas Sheraton (1751 – 22 October 1806) was a furniture designer, one of the &quot;big three&quot; English furniture makers of the 18th century, along with Thomas Chippendale and George Hepplewhite. Sheraton gave his name to a style of furniture characterized by a feminine refinement of late Georgian styles and became the most powerful source of inspiration behind the furniture of the late 18th century.

==Biography==
Sheraton was born in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, England - where nowadays there is a pub named after him. He was one of the leaders and preachers of the Stockton Baptist church and also preached elsewhere on his travels. He was apprenticed to a local cabinet maker and continued working as a journeyman cabinet maker until he moved to London in 1790, aged 39. There he set up as professional consultant and teacher, teaching perspective, architecture, and cabinet design for craftsmen. It is not known how he gained either the knowledge or the reputation which enabled him to do this but he appears to have been moderately successful.

Starting in 1791 he published in four volumes &quot;The Cabinet Maker&#x27;s and Upholsterer&#x27;s Drawing Book&quot;. At least six hundred cabinet makers and joiners subscribed to his book and it was immediately widely influential over a large part of the country. During this period he did not have a workshop of his own and it is believed that Sheraton himself never made any of the pieces shown in his books. No pieces of furniture have ever been traced to him directly. So a piece of furniture described as being &quot;by Sheraton&quot; refers to the design and not to the maker of the piece.

In 1803 he published &quot;The Cabinet Dictionary,&quot; a compendium of instructions on the techniques of cabinet and chair making. Then a year before his death, in 1805 he published the first volume of &quot;The Cabinet Maker, Upholsterer and General Artist&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot;.

Sheraton&#x27;s name is associated with the styles of furniture fashionable in the 1790s and early 19th century. Many of the designs are based on classical architecture, knowledge of which was an essential part of a designer&#x27;s technical education. Not all of the drawings are of his own design – he acknowledged that some of them came from works in progress in the workshops of practicing cabinet makers – but he was a superb draughtsman and he set his name on the style of the era.

<doc id="220021" wikidata="Q1138599" url="?curid=220021" title="Court of Cassation (France)">
<text>The Court of Cassation ( ) is the supreme court for civil and criminal cases in France. It is one of the country&#x27;s four superior courts, along with the Council of State, the Constitutional Council and the Jurisdictional Disputes Tribunal.

It primarily hears appeals against the decisions of courts of assizes and courts of appeal (appeals-in-cassation). The Court only reviews questions of law (but not questions of fact) and bears ultimate responsibility for a uniform interpretation and application of statutory law throughout France. It also filters out appeals challenging the constitutionality of statutes before forwarding them to the Counstitutional Council, reviews lower court verdicts on request of the European Court of Human Rights and hears several other types of cases.

The Court is organized into three civil chambers, a commerce chamber, a labour chamber, a criminal chamber, a prosecutorial service and various other bodies. The Court usually rules in panels of three or five judges; the most significant cases are adjudicated by plenary sessions. 

The Court was established in 1790 as the Tribunal of Cassation during the French Revolution; its original purpose was to act as a court of error with revisory jurisdiction over lower provincial prerogative courts (&quot;parlements&quot;). However, much about the Court continues the earlier Paris Parlement. Several other countries have courts of cassation based on the French model.

The Court is located in the Palace of Justice in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.

==Composition==

The Court is made up of justices, the Public prosecutor&#x27;s office, . In addition, a separate bar of specially certified barristers exists for trying cases at the French Court.

===Judges and divisions===
Overall, the Court consists of nearly 85 trial judges (&quot;conseillers&quot;) and about 40 deputy judges (&quot;conseillers référendaires&quot;), each divided among six different divisions (&quot;chambres&quot;):
*First Civil Division (&quot;première chambre civile&quot;) deals with contractual liability, international private law, arbitration, consumer law, family law, successions (wills), child custody, professional discipline, individual rights 
*Second Civil Division (&quot;deuxième chambre civile&quot;) handles civil procedural issues, torts, insurance law, social insurance law and electoral matters
*Third Civil Division (&quot;troisième chambre civile&quot;) (or &quot;Land Court&quot;) for immovable property (real estate), housing, commercial leases, construction law, urban planning law, environmental law
*Commercial Division (&quot;chambre commerciale, financière et économique&quot;) handles corporate law, bankruptcy, commercial law, business contracts, competition law, financial law and intellectual property rights
*Labor Division (&quot;chambre sociale&quot;) handles labor disputes, worker compensation.
*Criminal Division (&quot;chambre criminelle&quot;) deals with criminal cases and criminal procedural rules

Each division is headed by a presiding justice referred to in French as a &quot;président&quot;, or President of Division. The Chief Justice bears the title of the &quot;premier président&quot;, or President of the Court, who supervises the presiding justices of the various divisions. The Chief Justice is the highest-ranking judicial officer in the country and is responsible for administration of the Court and the discipline of justices. The current Chief Justice is . The Court also includes 12 masters (&quot;auditeurs&quot;), the lowest rank of justice, who are primarily concerned with administration.

There is, in addition to the abovementioned six divisions, a separate organization known as the Divisional Court (&quot;chambre mixte&quot;). The Divisional Court adjudicates where the subject matter of an appeal falls within the purview of multiple divisions. The Bench of the Divisional Court seats the Chief Justice and a number of other judges from at least three other divisions relevant to a given case. Any participating division is represented by its Presiding Justice and two puisne judges.

Finally, a full court (&quot;Assemblée plénière&quot;) is called, presided over by the Chief Justice or, if he is absent, by the most senior presiding justice. It also seats all divisional presiding justices and senior justices, assisted by a &quot;puisne&quot; judge from each division. The full court is the highest level of the Court.

===Office of the Prosecutor===

The prosecution, or &quot;parquet général&quot;, is headed by the Chief Prosecutor (&quot;procureur général&quot;). The Chief Prosecutor is a judicial officer, but does not prosecute cases; instead, his function is to advise the Court on how to proceed, analogous to the Commissioner-in-Council&#x27;s role within the Conseil d&#x27;État (lit. Council of State, but function may vary). Duties include filing motions to bring cases before the Court &quot;in the name of the law&quot; and bringing cases before the French Court of Justice (&quot;Cour de justice de la République&quot;), which tries government officials for crimes committed while in office. The Chief Prosecutor is assisted by two Chief Deputy Prosecutors (&quot;premiers avocats généraux&quot;) and a staff of about 22 deputy prosecutors (&quot;avocats généraux&quot;), and two assistant prosecutors (&quot;substituts&quot;).

===Supreme Court bar===
Barristers (&quot;avocats&quot;), though not technically officers of the court, play an integral role in the justice system. Except for a few types of actions, advocate counsel in the form of a barrister is mandatory for any case heard at the Court or Council of State. Barristers with exclusive rights of audience and admitted to practice law in either senior court are titled &quot;avocat au Conseil d&#x27;État et à la Cour de Cassation&quot;, or &quot;avocats aux Conseils&quot; (&quot;Counsel at Senior Court&quot;) for short. Admission to the Supreme Court bar is particularly difficult, requiring special training and passing a notoriously stringent examination. Once admitted, bar members can advise litigants on whether their actions are justiciable, that is, issuable and exceeding de minimis requirements—an important service since the court hears appeals only on points of law and not issues of fact. Membership is restricted to 60 total positions and is considered a public office.

===General counsel===
In May 2019, Jean-François Ricard was appointed General Counsel at the Court of Cassation to exercise the function of anti-terrorism public prosecutor at the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris, heading a new National Terrorism Prosecution Office (; PNAT), beginning on 25 June 2019. He leads a team of 25 magistrates.

==Proceedings==
The Court&#x27;s main purpose is to review lower court rulings on the grounds of legal or procedural error. As the highest court of law in France, it also has other duties.

===Appeals===
The Court has inherent appellate jurisdiction for appeals (called &quot;pourvois en cassation&quot;) from courts of appeal or, for certain types of small claims cases not appealable to appellate courts, from courts of record. The Supreme Court reviews the appeal on the record and may affirm or set aside lower court rulings; if set aside, the ruling is said to be &quot;cassé&quot; (French for &quot;quashed&quot;), hence the French name of &quot;Cour de cassation&quot;, or &quot;Quashing Court&quot;. The Court adjudicates by strict appeal, or appeal &quot;stricto sensu&quot;, which is limited to review of the decision and of the decision-making process on a point of law, and may only allow the appeal in cases of serious error; fresh evidence is not admissible. The typical outcome of a successful appeal is setting aside of the lower court&#x27;s decision and remittal for reconsideration.

An intermediate appellate court, the Cour d&#x27;appel, hears general appeals &quot;de novo&quot; on points of law and procedure as well as errors of fact and reasoning. The Court of Cassation only decides matters of points of law or procedure on the record, as opposed to factual errors. Lower courts may petition the Court for an interlocutory order during the proceedings on any new and complex point of law; any such order, however, is not final or conclusive.

===Appeal procedure===
A case is heard by a bench of three or five relevant divisional justices. For either civil or criminal appeals, the bench seats by three judges unless the Chief Justice or the divisional presiding justice orders a full bench of five judges. Furthermore, any one of the three judges originally assigned to the bench may order it expanded to five. If the case falls in the legal areas handled by more than one division, the Chief Justice may order the divisional court, rather than a Bench, to consider the case.

The Court can affirm a decision from below by dismissing the appeal (&quot;rejet du pourvoi&quot;) or overturn or amend the decision by allowing the appeal (&quot;accueil du pourvoi&quot;). If it finds that the lower court erred, it sets aside the lower court decision and remits the case with its opinion to an appellate court for reconsideration (&quot;cassation avec renvoi&quot;). If only a portion of a ruling is overturned, it is called &quot;cassation partielle&quot;, or partial setting aside. Sometimes, the Court may overturn a lower court ruling and judge the case &quot;ex proprio motu&quot; without being petitioned (&quot;cassation sans renvoi&quot;), as long as the merits and facts of the case are on record.

When overturned, the case is remanded to a second appellate court, in other words not the appellate court whose decision is being appealed; never to the same judges. The decision of the Bench of the Court of Cassation or Divisional Court is not binding on the lower court, and the appellate court has full discretion to decide the case, but the higher court&#x27;s ruling has persuasive authority. The appellate court&#x27;s ruling may again be appealed to the Court of Cassation. If so, the Full Court hears and judges the case. It may, again, uphold an earlier decision or reverse it and remand the case to another appellate court. In the latter case, the determination of the Full Court is binding; the facts, however, may be reviewed by the court retrying the case.

Published judgments are extremely brief, containing a statement of the case—citing relevant statutory authorities—and a summary of ruling. The ruling does not contain a ratio decidendi in the style of common-law jurisdictions. Instead, it is left to legal experts to explain the importance of rulings. The Court often drastically changes the way the Civil Code or other statutory laws are interpreted. Legal digests, such as the &quot;Recueil Dalloz&quot;, and treatises written by legal scholars analyze and explain rulings through precedents. Much of this information is available through online databases.

Unlike common-law jurisdictions, there is no doctrine of binding precedent (stare decisis) in France. Therefore, previous decisions of higher courts do not bind lower courts in the same hierarchy, though they are often followed and have persuasive authority. Instead, the French legal system subscribes to the legal doctrine of &quot;jurisprudence constante&quot; according to which courts should follow a series of decisions that are in accord with each other and judges should rule on their own interpretation of the law.

====Criminal appeals====
Major felonies (indictable offences), called &quot;crimes&quot; in French, are tried by jury in a county Court of Assizes. In the past, their decisions were not open to appeal in an intermediate appellate court, and before 2001, could only be appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court would review the case on points of procedure and law only, and when handing down a reversal, which was uncommon except for capital punishment cases, vested a second Court of Assizes to retry the case. An argument in favor of this system was that allowing appeals to be tried by active judges after having been decided by a jury would in essence deny popular sovereignty. Since 2001, Assize court rulings may be appealed on points of fact to a Court of Assizes in another county, vested by the Court, and before a larger jury. The case is then fully retried. For procedural issues, appeals to the Supreme Court are still possible since assize courts, which operate by jury trial, would not be competent to hear them.

====Certified questions====
Where no appeal has been made but the government disagrees with the lower court&#x27;s interpretation of the law, it may order the Chief Prosecutor to &quot;lay an appeal before the Court in the interest of law&quot; (&quot;former un pourvoi dans l&#x27;intérêt de la loi&quot;), i.e., appeal to certify a question of general public importance. The Chief Prosecutor may do so &quot;sua sponte&quot; or at the Court&#x27;s behest in either civil or criminal cases. The Court will then issue an advisory opinion which has no bearing on the lower court&#x27;s ruling since it was satisfactory to all parties involved and no motion was made to appeal. If the government is dissatisfied with the law as stated by the courts, it may ask Parliament to rewrite the law, as long as no constitutional issue is involved.

===Other duties===
The Court publishes an annual report on the French court system. The report includes a section with suggested changes to laws concerning the legal system, including criminal procedure. The Court awards damages to defendants exonerated after incarceration. Some high-level members of the court are ex officio members of special ad hoc courts; the investigatory commission of the High Court of Justice (&quot;Haute Cour de Justice&quot;), which may be convened to try the French President for high treason; the French Court of Justice (&quot;Cour de Justice de la République&quot;), which may be convened to try current or former cabinet ministers for crimes committed while in office; and the National Judicial Council (&quot;Conseil supérieur de la magistrature&quot;), which serves as a court of judicial discipline and disciplinary counsel. The High Court of Justice has never been convened during the Fifth Republic and the French Court of Justice, only rarely.

==Other related courts==
The Court is not the only court of last resort in France. Cases involving claims against government bodies, local authorities, or the central government, including all delegated legislation (e.g., statutory instruments, ministerial orders), are heard by the administrative courts, for which the court of last resort is the Conseil d&#x27;État. In cases where there appears to be concurrent jurisdiction or a conflict of laws between the judicial and administrative courts, whether both retain jurisdiction (&quot;positive dispute&quot;) or decline jurisdiction (&quot;negative dispute&quot;), the Jurisdictional Disputes Court (&quot;Tribunal des Conflits&quot;) decides the issue. The Court is composed of 4 members from both senior courts and occasionally, to break a tie, the justice minister who, if present, presides.

Neither court has the power to strike down primary legislation, such as acts of Parliament. The courts can, however, refuse to apply any statutory provision they consider inconsistent with France&#x27;s international treaty obligations. Constitutional review lies in the Constitutional Council, which can strike down any law that it deems unconstitutional. Before a law is enacted, the French President, the speaker of either house of Parliament, or, more commonly, 60 parliamentarians from the same house may petition the Council for review. Some laws, mostly constitutional laws (&quot;loi organique&quot;), come before the Constitutional Council for review without first being petitioned. Courts may adopt a restrictive approach to applying statute. A 2009 reform, effective on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial to question the constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as &quot;question prioritaire de constitutionnalité&quot;, is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, it is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, Cour de Cassation for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law is unconstitutional, the law is struck down and no longer has legal force; this decision applies to everybody and not just the appelant in the case at hand.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has jurisdiction over claims of government violations in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights in any ECHR member country, which includes all EU member countries. Before the ECtHR grants appeal, a claimant must have exhausted all available judicial recourse in the violating country; in France this means following the appeals process to either of the senior courts. Even so, the ECtHR has original jurisdiction, not appellate jurisdiction.

Additionally, French courts may petition the European Court of Justice to certify a question of law concerning EU law.

<text>The American Arbitration Association (AAA) is a non-profit organization focused in the field of alternative dispute resolution, providing services to individuals and organizations who wish to resolve conflicts out of court, and one of several arbitration organizations that administers arbitration proceedings. The AAA also administers mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. It is headquartered at the Equitable Building in New York City.

The AAA also administers International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR), established in 1996 and overseas international arbitration proceedings initiated under AAA rules. ICDR currently () has offices in New York City, Mexico City, Singapore, and Bahrain.

== History ==
The AAA was founded in 1926 by the merger of the Arbitration Society of America and the Arbitration Foundation to provide dispute resolution and avoid civil court proceedings.

Many contracts include an arbitration clause naming the AAA as the organization that will administer arbitration between the parties. The AAA does not itself arbitrate disputes, but provides administrative support to arbitrations before a single arbitrator or a panel of three arbitrators. Under its rules, the AAA may appoint an arbitrator in some circumstances, for example, where the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator or a party fails to exercise its right to appoint an arbitrator.

In July 2009, the AAA stopped accepting consumer debt collection cases, after the National Arbitration Forum was forced to do so after questions arose about the fairness of its process.

In April 2013, the New York State Department of Financial Services hired the AAA to host mediation sessions between insurance companies and Hurricane Sandy victims.

<doc id="220044" wikidata="Q6934941" url="?curid=220044" title="Multiple granularity locking">
<text>In computer science, multiple granularity locking (MGL) is a locking method used in database management systems (DBMS) and relational databases.

In multiple granularity locking, locks are set on objects that contain other objects. MGL exploits the hierarchical nature of the &quot;contains&quot; relationship. For example, a database may have files, which contain pages, which contain records. This can be thought of as a tree of objects, where each node contains its children. A lock on this structure (such as a shared or exclusive lock) locks the targeted node as well as all of its descendants.

Multiple granularity locking is usually used with non-strict two-phase locking to guarantee serializability.

==Lock modes==
In addition to shared (S) locks and exclusive (X) locks from other locking schemes, like strict two-phase locking, MGL also uses intentional &quot;locks&quot;, which do not directly lock a node, but instead denote the existence, or intent to add, a lock of the specified type lower in the node hierarchy. Intentional locks include &quot;intention shared&quot; (IS), &quot;intention exclusive&quot; (IX), and the combined &quot;shared and intention exclusive&quot; (SIX) locks. IS locks conflict with X locks, while IX locks conflict with S and X locks. The null lock (NL) is compatible with everything.

To lock a node in S (or X), MGL has the transaction lock on all of its ancestors with IS (or IX), so if a transaction locks a node in S (or X), no other transaction can access its ancestors in X (or S and X). This protocol is shown in the following table:

Determining what level of granularity to use for locking is done by locking the finest level possible (i.e., at the lowest leaf), and then escalating these locks to higher levels in the file hierarchy to cover more records or file elements as needed in a process known as &quot;lock escalation&quot;. MGL locking modes are compatible with each other as defined in the following matrix.
Following the locking protocol and the compatibility matrix, if one transaction holds a node in S mode, no other transactions can have locked any ancestor in X mode.
