She has also had an extensive career on stage, making her Broadway debut as a replacement in the comedy&quot; Cactus Flower&quot; in 1968. She starred in a 1999 revival of &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; in London, and received a Grammy nomination for Best Comedy Album for the 2000 recording.

==Career==
After seeing her 1973 film debut in &quot;Blume in Love&quot;, Neil Simon cast Mason in his Broadway play &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Mason and Simon, a widower, fell in love and got married. That same year, Mason co-starred opposite James Caan in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot;, which netted her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. In 1977, Mason&#x27;s performance in Simon&#x27;s smash hit film, &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;, won her a second Best Actress Academy Award nomination. In 1979, Simon successfully cast Mason as Jennie MacLaine in the screen adaptation of his hit play &quot;Chapter Two&quot;, which was based on Mason&#x27;s relationship with Simon up to their marriage. The film proved to be another big hit, garnering her a third Oscar nomination for Best Actress. 

In 1981, Mason starred along with Kristy McNichol, James Coco, and Joan Hackett in &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot;, Simon&#x27;s film adaptation of his Broadway comedy-drama &quot;The Gingerbread Lady&quot;; it was another box-office success. For her performance as Georgia Hines, Mason was highly praised and earned a fourth Best Actress Oscar nomination. 

Mason&#x27;s &quot;Max Dugan Returns&quot; (1983), also written by Simon, grossed a modest $17.6 million at the box office. Despite a stellar cast led by Mason, Donald Sutherland, Jason Robards and Matthew Broderick, the film was a slow starter, becoming more popular after premiering on cable TV and VHS. By this time, Mason and Simon had divorced, and her film career lost momentum. She co-starred with Clint Eastwood in the 1986 film &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot;, which was fairly well received and a commercial success. Mason also played a supporting role in the 1990 motion picture &quot;Stella&quot; starring Bette Midler, a remake of the 1937 film &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;. 

Mason played in a New York production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Old Times.&quot; She next directed the play &quot;Juno&#x27;s Swans&quot; (1986), by E. Katherine Kerr, at the Second Stage Theatre in Los Angeles.

Her stage credits include Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Deer Park,&quot; Israel Horovitz&#x27;s &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot;, Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; and Joseph Papp&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Richard III&quot; at the Lincoln Center. Mason starred on Broadway in a revival of &quot;Night of the Iguana&quot; in 1996, and the following year in Michael Cristofer&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. Mason reunited with &quot;Goodbye Girl&quot; co-star Richard Dreyfuss and writer Neil Simon in Duncan Weldon and Emanuel Azenberg&#x27;s production of &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; in 1999, which was performed at the L.A. Theatre Works shortly after a revival in London&#x27;s West End. She earned a Grammy nomination in comedy.
She appeared in Charles L. Mee&#x27;s &quot;Wintertime&quot; at the Second Stage theatre in New York. In August 2005 Mason starred as Hecuba at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater and on Broadway in &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;, with Delta Burke, Frances Sternhagen, Rebecca Gayheart, Lily Rabe and Christine Ebersole. She appeared in &quot;A Feminine Ending&quot; at Playwrights Horizons, and in the Shakespeare Theater Company&#x27;s performance of &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; in Washington, D.C. Recently, she starred in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; at Arena Stage in Washington, DC and off-Broadway in the Irish Repertory Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Little Gem&quot; which earned her an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Play. 

Mason&#x27;s television work includes guest roles on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot;, and &quot;Army Wives&quot;. Mason starred in her own series, &quot;Sibs&quot;, which ran from 1991 to 1992. In 1997 and 1998, she had a recurring role on the TV show &quot;Frasier&quot; as Sherry Dempsey, Martin Crane&#x27;s flamboyant girlfriend. She received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. In February 2010, she co-starred in &quot;California Suite&quot; at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles.

Mason played Patricia Heaton&#x27;s mother in the ABC comedy series &quot;The Middle&quot; from 2010 to its conclusion in 2018. Other recent TV roles have included &quot;Grace &amp; Frankie&quot;, &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; and &quot;The Good Wife&quot;.

In April 2010, Mason co-starred with Keir Dullea and Matt Servitto in an Off-Broadway production of &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot;. For her performance as Margaret Garrison, Mason received good reviews.

During the Pandemic, she appeared in zoom productions of &quot;Dear Liar&quot; with Brian Cox for Bucks County Playhouse and opposite Richard Dreyfus in &quot;The Letters of Noel Coward&quot; for Bay Street Playhouse in Sag Harbor, NY.

As a director, Mason has helmed productions of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Chapter Two&quot; and Robert Harling&#x27;s &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; at the Bucks County Playhouse; the first female version of &quot;An Act of God&quot; with Paige Davis at Arizona Theatre Company; &quot;Juno Stories&quot; for Second Stage in NYC; the world premiere of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Talisman Roses&quot; with Amanda Plummer for the Tennessee Williams Festival in Provincetown, Mass.; and a benefit production of &quot;The Man Who Came To Dinner&quot; starring Walter Bobbie and Brooke Shields for Bucks County Playhouse.

<text>Cinderella Liberty is a 1973 American drama film adapted by Daryl Ponicsan from his 1973 novel of the same title. The film tells the story of a sailor who falls in love with a prostitute and becomes a surrogate father for her 10-year-old mixed race son. The film stars James Caan, Marsha Mason and Eli Wallach, and was produced and directed by Mark Rydell.

The title is derived from the plot point that the sailor, while receiving medical treatment at the Navy base&#x27;s medical facility, is given what is called a &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot; pass which allows him to freely leave the naval base as long as he is back by midnight curfew. The movie was filmed in Seattle, Washington.

The film is one of two 1973 film adaptations of Ponicsan&#x27;s novels based on his experiences in the U.S. Navy; the other being &quot;The Last Detail&quot;.

==Plot==
John J. Baggs, Jr., a U.S. Navy sailor and Vietnam veteran, checks into the Seattle naval base medical facility for treatment of a pilonidal cyst. His medical test results are delayed, preventing him from rejoining his ship when it sails. He gets a clean bill of health, but must wait at the base for reassignment to another ship, and is given a &quot;Cinderella liberty&quot; pass that allows him to come and go from the base until the midnight curfew. Shortly thereafter, the base loses his records, making him unable to be reassigned or receive pay or benefits, and keeping him stuck at the base on &quot;Cinderella liberty&quot; until his records are found.

On his first night in a bar, he is racing the clock to find a woman before midnight, and is attracted to Maggie, a prostitute hustling sailors at a pool table. He challenges her at pool, and later goes to her tenement apartment for a sexual encounter, discovering that she lives with her bi-racial 11-year-old son Doug. Baggs later finds Doug out drinking beer, and lectures Maggie about her lack of motherly oversight towards her son. Noticing that Doug is often left to fend for himself, Baggs begins spending time with him, while also developing a relationship with Maggie, with whom he is falling in love. The couple almost break up when Baggs learns Maggie is pregnant by a man she knew before she met Baggs, but they reconcile and Baggs accepts responsibility for the unborn child as well.

At the base, Baggs runs into his former training instructor, an older sailor named Forshay, who treated Baggs brutally. After an initial fistfight, Baggs learns that Forshay has been demoted and is being discharged due to his mistreatment of recruits, one of whom had political connections. Forshay&#x27;s love of the Navy has been the only constant in his life and Forshay has no family or relationships outside the Navy. Baggs feels sorry for him and becomes his friend, while not wanting to repeat the same pattern in his own life. After his discharge, Forshay loses his pension and is forced to take a menial job as a strip show barker.

Baggs attempts to create a normal family life for Maggie and Doug, and succeeds for a while despite the obstacles presented by his lack of pay and benefits. He and Maggie marry, but due to his lost records, the Navy refuses to recognize the marriage or grant Maggie and Doug the normal privileges given to a sailor&#x27;s family. Doug, suspicious and cynical at first, bonds with Baggs, who manages to get Doug&#x27;s painfully decayed teeth fixed at the naval base by an unqualified dental assistant. Maggie gives birth prematurely to a son, whom she names after Baggs, but the baby dies soon after birth, causing a distraught Maggie to return to prostitution in order to distract herself from her grief. The Navy finally locates Baggs&#x27; records and reassigns him to a new ship, also giving him $1400 in back pay. When he goes to tell Maggie, he finds she has departed for New Orleans with another man, and left Doug behind for Baggs to look after. In order to stay with Doug, Baggs gets Forshay to change places with him and ship out under his name. After waving goodbye to a happy Forshay, Baggs and Doug then head for New Orleans to look for Maggie.

He and Mason reunited on &quot;Chapter Two&quot;.

<doc id="225474" wikidata="Q256898" url="?curid=225474" title="White Anglo-Saxon Protestants">
<text>In the United States, White Anglo-Saxon Protestants or Wealthy Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASP) is a sociological term which is often used to describe white Protestant Americans of English, or more broadly British, descent who are generally part of the white dominant culture or upper-class and historically often the Mainline Protestant elite. Some sociologists and commentators use &quot;WASP&quot; more broadly to include all White Protestant Americans of Northwestern European and Northern European ancestry. It was seen to be in exclusionary contrast to Catholics, Jews, Irish, immigrants, southern or eastern Europeans, and the non-White. WASPs have dominated American society, culture, and politics for most of the history of the United States. Critics have disparaged them as &quot;The Establishment&quot;. Although the social influence of wealthy WASPs has declined since the 1960s, the group continues to play a central role in American finance, politics, and philanthropy.

&quot;WASP&quot; is also used for similar elites in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The 1998 &quot;Random House Unabridged Dictionary&quot; says the term is &quot;sometimes disparaging and offensive&quot;.

==Naming and definition==
In the early Middle Ages Anglian and Saxon kingdoms were established over most of England, (&#x27;land of the Angles&#x27;). After the Norman conquest in 1066, &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; refers to the pre-invasion English people. Political scientist Andrew Hacker used the term &quot;WASP&quot; in 1957, with &quot;W&quot; standing for &#x27;wealthy&#x27; rather than &#x27;white&#x27;. The &quot;P&quot; formed a humorous epithet to imply &quot;waspishness&quot; or someone likely to make sharp, slightly cruel remarks. Describing the class of Americans that held &quot;national power in its economic, political, and social aspects&quot;, Hacker wrote:

An earlier usage appeared in the African-American newspaper &quot;The New York Amsterdam News&quot; in 1948, when author Stetson Kennedy wrote:

The term was later popularized by sociologist and University of Pennsylvania professor E. Digby Baltzell, himself a WASP, in his 1964 book &quot;The Protestant Establishment: Aristocracy and Caste in America&quot;. Baltzell stressed the closed or caste-like characteristic of the group by arguing that &quot;There is a crisis in American leadership in the middle of the twentieth century that is partly due, I think, to the declining authority of an establishment which is now based on an increasingly castelike White-Anglo Saxon-Protestant (WASP) upper class.&quot;

Citing Gallup polling data from 1976, Kit and Frederica Konolige wrote in their 1978 book &quot;The Power of Their Glory&quot;, &quot;As befits a church that belongs to the worldwide Anglican Communion, Episcopalianism has the United Kingdom to thank for the ancestors of fully 49 percent of its members. ... The stereotype of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) finds its fullest expression in the Episcopal Church.&quot;

&quot;WASP&quot; is also used in Australia and Canada for similar elites. WASPs traditionally have been associated with Episcopal (or Anglican), Presbyterian, United Methodist, Congregationalist, and other mainline Protestant denominations; however, the term has expanded to include other Protestant denominations as well.

===&quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; in modern usage===
The concept of Anglo-Saxonism, and especially Anglo-Saxon Protestantism, evolved in the late 19th century, especially among American Protestant missionaries eager to transform the world. Historian Richard Kyle says:

Protestantism had not yet split into two mutually hostile camps – the liberals and fundamentalists. Of great importance, evangelical Protestantism still dominated the cultural scene. American values bore the stamp of this Anglo-Saxon Protestant ascendancy. The political, cultural, religious, and intellectual leaders of the nation were largely of a Northern European Protestant stock, and they propagated public morals compatible with their background.

Before &quot;WASP&quot; came into use in the 1960s, the term &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; served some of the same purposes. Like the newer term &quot;WASP&quot;, the older term &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; was used derisively by writers hostile to an informal alliance between Britain and the U.S. The negative connotation was especially common among Irish Americans and writers in France. &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot;, meaning in effect the whole Anglosphere, remains a term favored by the French, used disapprovingly in contexts such as criticism of the Special Relationship of close diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the UK and complaints about perceived &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; cultural or political dominance. In December 1918, after victory in the World War, President Woodrow Wilson told a British official in London: &quot;You must not speak of us who come over here as cousins, still less as brothers; we are neither. Neither must you think of us as Anglo-Saxons, for that term can no longer be rightly applied to the people of the United States...There are only two things which can establish and maintain closer relations between your country and mine: they are community of ideals and of interests.&quot; The term remains in use in Ireland as a term for the British or English, and sometimes in Scottish Nationalist discourse. Irish-American humorist Finley Peter Dunne popularized the ridicule of &quot;Anglo-Saxons&quot;, even calling President Theodore Roosevelt one. Roosevelt insisted he was Dutch. &quot;To be genuinely Irish is to challenge WASP dominance&quot;, argues California politician Tom Hayden. The depiction of the Irish in the films of John Ford was a counterpoint to WASP standards of rectitude. &quot;The procession of rambunctious and feckless Celts through Ford&#x27;s films, Irish and otherwise, was meant to cock a snoot at WASP or &#x27;lace-curtain Irish&#x27; ideas of respectability.&quot;

In Australia, &quot;Anglo&quot; or &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; refers to people of English descent, while &quot;Anglo-Celtic&quot; includes people of Irish, Welsh, and Scottish descent.

In France, &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; refers to the combined impact of Britain and the United States on European affairs. Charles de Gaulle repeatedly sought to &quot;rid France of Anglo-Saxon influence&quot;. The term is used with more nuance in discussions by French writers on French decline, especially as an alternative model to which France should aspire, how France should adjust to its two most prominent global competitors, and how it should deal with social and economic modernization.

Outside of Anglophone countries, the term &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; and its translations are used to refer to the Anglophone peoples and societies of Britain, the United States, and countries such as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Variations include the German , French , Spanish &quot;anglosajón&quot;, Dutch &#x27; and Italian &#x27;.

===Anglo-Saxonism in the 19th century===
In the nineteenth century, Anglo-Saxons was often used as a synonym for all people of English descent and sometimes more generally, for all the English-speaking peoples of the world. It was often used in implying superiority, much to the annoyance of outsiders. For example, American clergyman Josiah Strong boasted in 1890:

In 1700 this race numbered less than 6,000,000 souls. In 1800, Anglo-Saxons (I use the term somewhat broadly to include all English-speaking peoples) had increased to about 20,500,000, and now, in 1890, they number more than 120,000,000.

In 1893, Strong envisioned a future &quot;new era&quot; of triumphant Anglo-Saxonism:

Is it not reasonable to believe that this race is destined to dispossess many weaker ones, assimilate others, and mould the remainder until... it has Anglo-Saxonized mankind?

===Other European ethnicities===
The popular and sociological usage of the term WASP has sometimes expanded to include not just &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; or English-American elites but also American people of other Protestant Northwestern European origin, including Protestant Dutch Americans, Scottish Americans, Welsh Americans, German Americans, Ulster Scots or &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot; Americans, and Scandinavian Americans. A 1969 &quot;Time&quot; article stated, &quot;purists like to confine Wasps to descendants of the British Isles; less exacting analysts are willing to throw in Scandinavians, Netherlanders and Germans.&quot; The sociologist Charles H. Anderson writes, &quot;Scandinavians are second-class WASPs&quot; but know it is &quot;better to be a second-class WASP than a non-WASP&quot;.

Sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey described the further expansion of the term&#x27;s meaning:

The term &quot;WASP&quot; has many meanings. In sociology it reflects that segment of the U.S. population that founded the nation and traced their heritages to...Northwestern Europe. The term...has become more inclusive. To many people, WASP now includes most &#x27;white&#x27; people who are not ... members of any minority group.

Apart from Protestant English, British, German, Dutch, and Scandinavian Americans, other ethnic groups frequently included under the label &quot;WASP&quot; include Americans of French Huguenot descent, Protestant Americans of Germanic European descent in general, and established Protestant American families of a &quot;mix&quot; of or of &quot;vague&quot; Germanic Northwestern European heritages.

==Culture==
Historically, the early Anglo-Protestant settlers in the seventeenth century were the most successful group, culturally, economically, and politically, and they maintained their dominance until the late twentieth century at the earliest. Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families, such as Boston Brahmin, First Families of Virginia, Old Philadelphians, Tidewater, and Lowcountry gentry or old money, were WASPs. Commitment to the ideals of the Enlightenment meant that they sought to assimilate newcomers from outside of the British Isles, but few were interested in adopting a Pan-European identity for the nation, much less turning it into a global melting pot. However, in the early 1900s, liberal progressives and modernists began promoting more inclusive ideals for what the national identity of the United States should be. While the more traditionalist segments of society continued to maintain their Anglo-Protestant ethnocultural traditions, universalism and cosmopolitanism started gaining favor among the elites. These ideals became institutionalized after the Second World War, and ethnic minorities started moving towards institutional parity with the once dominant Anglo-Protestants.

===Education===

Some of the first colleges and universities in America, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Rutgers, Columbia, Dartmouth, Pennsylvania, Duke, Boston University, Williams, Bowdoin, Middlebury, and Amherst, all were founded by mainline Protestant denominations.

Expensive, private prep schools and universities have historically been associated with WASPs. Colleges such as the Ivy League, the Little Ivies, and the Seven Sisters colleges are particularly intertwined with the culture. Until roughly World War II, Ivy League universities were composed largely of white Protestants. While admission to these schools is generally based upon merit, many of these universities give a legacy preference for the children of alumni in order to link elite families (and their wealth) with the school. These legacy admissions have allowed for the continuation of WASP influence on important sectors of the US.

Members of Protestant denominations associated with WASPs have some of the highest proportions of advanced degrees. Examples include the Episcopal Church, with 76% of those polled having some college education, and the Presbyterian Church, with 64%.

According to &quot;Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States&quot; by Harriet Zuckerman, between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize laureates have come from a Protestant background, mostly from Episcopalian, Presbyterian or Lutheran background, while Protestants made up roughly 67% of the US population during that period. Of Nobel prizes awarded to Americans between 1901 and 1972, 84.2% of those in Chemistry, 60% in Medicine, and 58.6% in Physics were awarded to Protestants.

===Religion===
The White Anglo-Saxon Protestant upper class has largely held church membership in the mainline Protestant denominations of Christianity, chiefly the Presbyterian, Episcopalian, and Congregationalist traditions.

Citing Gallup polling data from 1976, Kit and Frederica Konolige wrote in their 1978 book &quot;The Power of Their Glory&quot;, &quot;As befits a church that belongs to the worldwide Anglican Communion, Episcopalianism has the United Kingdom to thank for the ancestors of fully 49 percent of its members. ... The stereotype of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) finds its fullest expression in the Episcopal Church.&quot;

===Politics===
From 1854 until about 1964, white Protestants were predominantly Republicans. More recently, the group is split more evenly between the Republican and Democratic parties.

===Wealth===
Episcopalians and Presbyterians are among the wealthiest religious groups and were formerly disproportionately represented in American business, law, and politics. Old money in the United States was typically associated with WASP status, particularly with the Episcopal and Presbyterian Church. Some of the wealthiest and most affluent American families such as the Vanderbilts, Astors, Rockefellers, Du Ponts, Roosevelts, Forbes, Fords, Mellons, Whitneys, Morgans, and Harrimans are white primarily mainline Protestant families.

According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Episcopalians ranked as the third wealthiest religious group in the United States, with 35% of Episcopalians living in households with incomes of at least $100,000. Presbyterians ranked as the fourth most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 32% of Presbyterians living in households with incomes of at least $100,000.

===Location===
The &quot;Boston Brahmins&quot;, who were regarded as the nation&#x27;s social and cultural elites, were often associated with the American upper class, Harvard University, and the Episcopal Church.

Like other sociological groups, WASPs tend to concentrate within close proximity to each other. These areas are often exclusive and associated with top schools, high incomes, well-established church communities, and high real-estate values. For example, in the Detroit area, WASPs predominantly possessed the wealth that came from the new automotive industry. After the 1967 Detroit riot, they tended to congregate in the Grosse Pointe suburbs. In the Chicago metropolitan area, white Protestants primarily reside in the North Shore suburbs, the Barrington area in the northwest suburbs, and in Oak Park and DuPage County in the western suburbs. Traditionally, the Upper East Side in Manhattan has been dominated by wealthy White Anglo-Saxon Protestant families.

===Social values===
David Brooks, a (Jewish) columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; who attended an Episcopal prep school, writes that WASPs took pride in &quot;good posture, genteel manners, personal hygiene, pointless discipline, the ability to sit still for long periods of time.&quot; According to the essayist Joseph Epstein, WASPs developed a style of understated quiet leadership.

A common practice of WASP families is presenting their daughters of marriageable age (traditionally at the age of 17 or 18 years old) at a débutante ball, such as the International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City.

===&quot;Social Register&quot;===
America&#x27;s social elite was a small, closed group. The leadership was well-known to the readers of newspaper society pages, but in larger cities it was hard to remember everyone, or to keep track of the new debutantes and marriages. The solution was the &quot;Social Register&quot;, which listed the names and addresses of about 1 percent of the population. Most were WASPs, and they included families who mingled at the same private clubs, attended the right teas and cotillions, worshipped together at prestige churches, funded the proper charities, lived in exclusive neighborhoods, and sent their daughters to finishing schools and their sons away to prep schools. In the heyday of WASP dominance, the &quot;Social Register&quot; delineated high society. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, its influence had faded by the late 20th century:

===Fashion===
In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that there was a rising interest in the WASP culture. In their review of Susanna Salk&#x27;s &quot;A Privileged Life: Celebrating WASP Style&quot;, they stated that Salk &quot;is serious about defending the virtues of WASP values, and their contribution to American culture.&quot;

By the 1980s, brands such as Lacoste and Ralph Lauren and their logos became associated with the preppy fashion style which was associated with WASP culture.

==Social and political influence==
The term &quot;WASP&quot; became associated with an upper class in the United States due to over-representation of WASPs in the upper echelons of society. Until the mid–20th century, industries such as banks, insurance, railroads, utilities, and manufacturing were dominated by WASPs.

The Founding Fathers of the United States were mostly educated, well-to-do, of British ancestry, and Protestants. According to a study of the biographies of signers of the Declaration of Independence by Caroline Robbins:

The Signers came for the most part from an educated elite, were residents of older settlements, and belonged with a few exceptions to a moderately well-to-do class representing only a fraction of the population. Native or born overseas, they were of British stock and of the Protestant faith.

Catholics in the Northeast and the Midwest—mostly immigrants and their descendants from Ireland and Germany as well as southern and eastern Europe—came to dominate Democratic Party politics in big cities through the ward boss system. Catholic politicians were often the target of WASP political hostility.

Political scientist Eric Kaufmann argues that &quot;the 1920s marked the high tide of WASP control&quot;. In 1965, Canadian sociologist John Porter, in &quot;The Vertical Mosaic&quot;, argued that British origins were disproportionately represented in the higher echelons of Canadian class, income, political power, the clergy, the media, etc. However, more recently, Canadian scholars have traced the decline of the WASP elite.

===Post–World War II===
According to Ralph E. Pyle:

Many reasons have been given for the decline of WASP power, and books have been written detailing it. Self-imposed diversity incentives opened the country&#x27;s most elite schools. The GI Bill brought higher education to new ethnic arrivals, who found middle class jobs in the postwar economic expansion. Nevertheless, white Protestants remain influential in the country&#x27;s cultural, political, and economic elite. Scholars typically agree that the group&#x27;s influence has waned since 1945, with the growing influence of other ethnic groups.

After 1945, Catholics and Jews made strong inroads in getting jobs in the federal civil service, which was once dominated by those from Protestant backgrounds, especially the Department of State. Georgetown University, a Catholic school, made a systematic effort to place graduates in diplomatic career tracks. By the 1990s, there were &quot;roughly the same proportion of WASPs, Catholics, and Jews at the elite levels of the federal civil service, and a greater proportion of Jewish and Catholic elites among corporate lawyers.&quot; The political scientist Theodore P. Wright Jr., argues that while the Anglo ethnicity of the U.S. presidents from Richard Nixon through George W. Bush is evidence for the continued cultural dominance of WASPs, assimilation and social mobility, along with the ambiguity of the term, has led the WASP class to survive only by &quot;incorporating other groups [so] that it is no longer the same group&quot; that existed in the mid-20th century.

Very few Jewish lawyers were hired by White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (&quot;WASP&quot;) upscale white-shoe law firms, but they started their own. The WASP dominance in law ended when a number of major Jewish law firms attained elite status in dealing with top-ranked corporations. Most white-shoe firms also excluded Roman Catholics. As late as 1950 there was not a single large Jewish law firm in New York City. However, by 1965 six of the 20 largest firms were Jewish; by 1980 four of the ten largest were Jewish.

Two famous confrontations signifying a decline in WASP dominance were the 1952 Senate election in Massachusetts, in which John F. Kennedy, a Catholic of Irish descent, defeated WASP Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., and the 1964 challenge by Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater—an Episcopalian who had solid WASP credentials through his mother, but whose father was Jewish, and was seen by some as part of the Jewish community—to Nelson Rockefeller and the Eastern Republican establishment, which led to the liberal Rockefeller Republican wing of the party being marginalized by the 1980s, overwhelmed by the dominance of Southern and Western conservatives. However, asking &quot;Is the WASP leader a dying breed?&quot;, journalist Nina Strochlic in 2012 pointed to eleven WASP top politicians, ending with Republicans George H. W. Bush, elected in 1988, his son George W. Bush, elected in 2000 and 2004, and John McCain, who was nominated but defeated in 2008. Mary Kenny argues that Barack Obama, although famous as the first Black president, exemplifies highly controlled &quot;unemotional delivery&quot; and &quot;rational detachment&quot; characteristic of WASP personality traits. Indeed, he attended upper class schools such as Columbia and Harvard, and was raised by his WASP mother Ann Dunham and the Dunham grandparents in a family that dates to Jonathan Singletary Dunham, born in Massachusetts in 1640. Inderjeet Parmar and Mark Ledwidge argue that Obama pursued a typically WASP-inspired foreign policy of liberal internationalism.
In the 1970s, a &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine study found one-in-five of the country&#x27;s largest businesses and one-in-three of its largest banks was run by an Episcopalian. More recent studies indicate a still-disproportionate, though somewhat reduced, influence of WASPs among economic elites.

The reversal of WASP fortune was exemplified by the Supreme Court. Historically, the great majority of its justices were of WASP heritage. The exceptions included seven Catholics and two Jews. Since the 1960s, an increasing number of non-WASP justices have been appointed to the Court. From 2010 to 2017, the Court had no Protestant members, until the appointment of Neil Gorsuch in 2017.

The University of California, Berkeley, once a WASP stronghold, has changed radically: only 30% of its undergraduates in 2007 were of European origin (including WASPs and all other Europeans), and 63% of undergraduates at the university were from immigrant families (where at least one parent was an immigrant), especially Asian. Once also a WASP bastion, as of 2010 Harvard University enrolled 9,289 non-Hispanic white students (44%, of which approximately 30% were Jewish), 2,658 Asian American students (13%), 1,239 Hispanic students (6%), and 1,198 African American students (6%).

A significant shift of American economic activity toward the Sun Belt during the latter part of the 20th century and an increasingly globalized economy have also contributed to the decline in power held by Northeastern WASPs. James D. Davidson et al. argued in 1995 that while WASPs were no longer solitary among the American elite, members of the Patrician class remained markedly prevalent within the current power structure.

Other analysts have argued that the extent of the decrease in WASP dominance has been overstated. In response to increasing claims of fading WASP dominance, Davidson, using data on American elites in political and economic spheres, concluded in 1994 that, while the WASP and Protestant establishment had lost some of its earlier prominence, WASPs and Protestants were still vastly overrepresented among America&#x27;s elite.

In August 2012 the &quot;New York Times,&quot; reviewed the religion of the fifteen top national leaders: the presidential and vice-presidential nominees, the Supreme Court justices, the House Speaker, and the Senate majority leader. There were nine Catholics (six justices, both vice-presidential candidates, and the Speaker), three Jews (all from the Supreme Court), two Mormons (including the Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney) and one African-American Protestant (incumbent President Barack Obama). There were no white Protestants.

===Hostile epithet===
Sociologist John W. Dykstra in 1958 described the &quot;white Anglo-Saxon Protestant&quot; as &quot;Mr. Bigot&quot;. Historian Martin Marty said in 1991 that WASPs &quot;are the one ethnoreligioracial group that all can demean with impunity.&quot;

In the 21st century, &quot;WASP&quot; is often applied as a derogatory label to those with social privilege who are perceived to be snobbish and exclusive, such as being members of restrictive private social clubs. Kevin M. Schultz stated in 2010 that WASP is &quot;a much-maligned class identity...Today, it signifies an elitist snoot.&quot; A number of popular jokes ridicule those thought to fit the stereotype.

Occasionally, a writer praises the WASP contribution, as conservative historian Richard Brookhiser did in 1991, when he said the &quot;uptight, bland, and elitist&quot; stereotype obscures the &quot;classic WASP ideals of industry, public service, family duty, and conscience to revitalize the nation.&quot; Likewise, conservative writer Joseph Epstein praised WASP history in 2013 and asked, &quot;Are we really better off with a country run by the self-involved, over-schooled products of modern meritocracy?&quot; He deplores how the WASP element lost its self-confidence and came under attack as &quot;The Establishment&quot;.

==In media==
American films, including &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, have used the conflicts between WASP families and urban Jewish families for comedic effect.

The 1939 Broadway play &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;, later adapted into a Hollywood film released in 1944, ridiculed the old American elite. The play and film depict &quot;old-stock British Americans&quot; a decade before they were tagged as WASPS.

The playwright A. R. Gurney (1930–2017), himself of WASP heritage, has written a series of plays that have been called &quot;penetratingly witty studies of the WASP ascendancy in retreat&quot;. Gurney told the &quot;Washington Post&quot; in 1982:

In Gurney&#x27;s play &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot; (1988), a lead character tells her playwright son that theater critics &quot;don&#x27;t like us... They resent us. They think we&#x27;re all Republicans, all superficial and all alcoholics. Only the latter is true.&quot;

Filmmaker Whit Stillman, whose godfather was E. Digby Baltzell, has made films dealing primarily with WASP characters and subjects. Stillman has been called the &quot;WASP Woody Allen&quot;. His debut 1990 film &quot;Metropolitan&quot; tells the story of a group of college-age Manhattan socialites during débutante season. A recurring theme of the film is the declining power of the old Protestant élite.

<text>The Way We Were is a 1973 American romantic drama film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford. Arthur Laurents adapted the screenplay from his own 1972 novel of the same name, which was based on his college days at Cornell University and his experiences with the House Un-American Activities Committee.

A box-office success, the film was nominated for several awards and won the Academy Awards for Best Original Dramatic Score and Best Original Song for the theme song &quot;The Way We Were&quot;. It ranked at number six on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions survey of the top 100 greatest love stories in American cinema. &quot;The Way We Were&quot; is considered one of the great romantic films.

The soundtrack album became a gold record and hit the Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while the title song became a gold single, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and selling more than two million copies. &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;The Way We Were&quot; as the number 1 pop hit of 1974. In 1998, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and finished at number eight on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years... 100 Songs&quot; list of top tunes in American cinema in 2004. It also was included in the list of Songs of the Century, by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.

==Plot==
Katie Morosky and Hubbell Gardiner are two college students with immensely different lives in 1937. Katie is a staunch Marxist Jew with strong anti-war opinions, while Hubbell is a carefree WASP with no particular political bent. As their paths cross, Katie admires Hubbell&#x27;s good looks and his excellent writing; Hubbell is charmed by Katie&#x27;s steadfast commitment to social causes. His snobbish friends mock Katie and her passionate political stances. They briefly dance at the senior prom, then part ways.

The two meet again in New York City near the end of World War II: Katie juggles multiple jobs, and Hubbell is back from active duty as a naval officer in the South Pacific. The unlikely pair fall in love. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt dies, Katie is incensed when Hubbell&#x27;s friends make disparaging jokes. She rejects Hubbell&#x27;s indifference towards their insensitivity and dismissive political engagement. Hubbell is frustrated by Katie&#x27;s bluntness and strong opinions; he ends their relationship, but they eventually reconcile.

Hubbell receives an offer to adapt his novel into a screenplay, but Katie is concerned his talent will be wasted in Hollywood. Despite her apprehensions, they move to Malibu, where Hubbell&#x27;s studio contract offers an affluent lifestyle. As the Hollywood blacklist grows and McCarthyism encroaches on their lives, Katie&#x27;s political activism resurfaces, potentially jeopardizing Hubbell&#x27;s reputation and livelihood.

Katie and others publicly confront the government over personal privacy and free speech. Her involvement strains the marriage, and Hubbell becomes alienated over Katie&#x27;s persistent political combativeness. Although Katie is now pregnant, Hubbell has an affair with his former college girlfriend. Katie realizes Hubbell is not the man she idealized and that he will always choose the easiest path. Hubbell is emotionally exhausted and unable to live up to Katie&#x27;s expectations of him. After their daughter&#x27;s birth, Katie and Hubbell divorce.

Years later, Katie and Hubbell meet by chance in front of the Plaza Hotel in New York City, where Katie is demonstrating to &quot;Ban the Bomb&quot;. A taxi interrupts their reunion, but they ultimately part with a tender, bittersweet farewell.

==Production==
In 1937, while an undergraduate at Cornell, Arthur Laurents was introduced to political activism by a student who became the model for Katie Morosky, a member of the Young Communist League and an outspoken opponent of Francisco Franco and his effort to take control of Spain via the Spanish Civil War. The fiery campus radical organized rallies and a peace strike, and the memory of her fervour remained with Laurents long after the two lost touch.

Laurents decided to develop a story with a similar character at its centre, but was unsure what other elements to add. He recalled a creative writing instructor named Robert E. Short, who felt he had a good ear for dialogue and had encouraged him to write plays. His first instinct was to create a crisis between his leading lady and her college professor, but he decided her passion needed to be politics, not writing. What evolved was a male character who had a way with words, but no strong inclination to apply himself to a career using them.

Because of his own background, Laurents felt it was important for his heroine to be Jewish and share his outrage at injustice. He also thought it was time a mainstream Hollywood film had a Jewish heroine, and because Barbra Streisand was the industry&#x27;s most notable Jewish star, he wrote the role of Katie Morosky for her. Laurents had known Streisand for some time, having cast her in his 1962 Broadway musical &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot;. Hubbell Gardiner, initially a secondary character, was drawn from several people Laurents knew. The first name was borrowed from urbane television producer Hubbell Robinson, who had hired Laurents to write an episode of &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;. The looks and personality came from two primary sources - writer Peter Viertel and a man Laurents referred to only as &quot;Tony Blue Eyes&quot;, an acquaintance who inspired the scene where the creative writing instructor reads Hubbell&#x27;s short story to his class.

Laurents wrote a lengthy treatment for Ray Stark, who read it on a transcontinental flight and called the screenwriter the moment he arrived in Los Angeles to greenlight the project. Laurents had been impressed with &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; and suggested Sydney Pollack to direct. Streisand was impressed that he had studied with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in Manhattan and seconded the choice. Stark was less enthusiastic, but agreed because Pollack assured him he could deliver Robert Redford for the role of Hubbell, which Laurents had written with Ryan O&#x27;Neal in mind. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s affair with Streisand was at its end, and Stark wanted to avoid conflicts between the leads.

Laurents ultimately regretted recommending Pollack. The director demanded the role of Hubbell be made equal to that of Katie and throughout filming, for unexplained reasons, he kept Laurents away from Redford. What was intended to be the final draft of the screenplay was written by Laurents and Pollack at Stark&#x27;s condominium in Sun Valley, Idaho. Laurents, dismayed to discover very little of his work remained when it was completed, left the project. Over time, 11 writers, including Dalton Trumbo, Alvin Sargent, Paddy Chayefsky, and Herb Gardner, contributed to the script. The end result was a garbled story filled with holes that neither Streisand nor Redford liked. Laurents was asked to return and did so only after demanding and receiving an exorbitant amount of money. 

Because the film&#x27;s start date was delayed while it underwent numerous rewrites, Cornell was lost as a shooting location; filming instead took place at Union College in Schenectady, New York. Other locations included the village of Ballston Spa in upstate New York; Central Park; the beach in Malibu, California; and Union Station in Los Angeles, the latter for a scene Laurents felt was absurd and fought to have deleted, without success.

Laurents was horrified when he saw the first rough cut of the film. He thought it had a few good scenes, and some good moments in bad scenes, but overall, he thought it was a badly photographed, jumbled mess lacking coherence. Both stars appeared to be playing themselves more often than their characters, and Streisand often used a grand accent that Laurents felt hurt her performance. Pollack admitted the film was not good, accepted full responsibility for its problems, and apologized for his behavior. The following day, he retreated to the editing room to improve it as much as possible. Laurents felt the changes made it better, but never as good as it could have been.

A decade after the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, contacted him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project and eventually the two settled on a sequel to &quot;The Way We Were&quot;. In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet, but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed they did not want Pollack to be part of the equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script, but aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written and decided she wanted to produce and direct it, as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good as he remembered it being and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring Kathie Lee Gifford. Laurents declined and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo.

==Soundtrack==

The musical score for &quot;The Way We Were&quot; was composed by Marvin Hamlisch. A soundtrack album was released in January 1974 to much success. At the time of its initial release, the album peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On October 19, 1993, it was re-released on CD by Sony. It includes Streisand&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Way We Were&quot;, which at the time of the film&#x27;s release was a commercial success and her first number-one single in the United States. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in November 1973 and charted for 23 weeks, eventually selling over a million copies and was number one for three non-consecutive weeks in February 1974. On the Adult Contemporary chart, it was Streisand&#x27;s second top hit, following &quot;People&quot; a decade earlier. It was the title track of a Streisand album that reached number one.

==Reception==
In North America, the film was a massive commercial success, grossing $49,919,870. It was the fifth-high-grossing film of the year, earning an estimated $10 million in North American rentals in 1973, and a total of $22,457,000 in its theatrical run.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Way We Were&quot; was featured on the Top Ten Films of 1973 by the National Board of Review. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and called it &quot;essentially just a love story, and not sturdy enough to carry the burden of both radical politics and a bittersweet ending.&quot; He added &quot;It&#x27;s easy to forgive the movie a lot because of Streisand. She&#x27;s fantastic. She&#x27;s the brightest, quickest female in movies today, inhabiting her characters with a fierce energy and yet able to be touchingly vulnerable...The Redford character perhaps in reaction to the inevitable Streisand performance, is passive and without edges. The primary purpose of the character is to provide someone into whose life Streisand can enter and then leave. That&#x27;s sort of thankless, but Redford handles it well.&quot; Ebert further added &quot;Instead, inexplicably, the movie suddenly and implausibly has them fall out of love - and they split up without resolving anything, particularly the plot.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that &quot;with Streisand as the film&#x27;s intellectual mouthpiece—and listen, as a singer, God bless her—there is no way that the film&#x27;s ideas are going to come off as anything but patronizing and tinged with comedy.&quot;
In her review, Pauline Kael noted, &quot;the decisive change in the characters&#x27; lives which the story hinges on takes place suddenly and hardly makes sense.&quot; She was not the only critic to question the gap in the plot. Of the scene in the hospital shortly after Katie gives birth and they part indefinitely, Molly Haskell wrote, &quot;She seems to know all about it, but it came as a complete shock to me.&quot; In his review, critic John Simon wrote: &quot;Some things, I suppose, never change, like the necktie Redford wears in two scenes that take place many years apart.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a distended, talky, redundant, and moody melodrama&quot; and adds, &quot;but Robert Redford has too little to work with in the script,&quot; and &quot;The overemphasis on Streisand makes the film just another one of those Streisand vehicles where no other elements ever get a chance.&quot; &quot;Time Out London&quot; observed &quot;[W]ith the script glossing whole areas of confrontation (from the Communist &#x27;30s to the McCarthy witch-hunts), it often passes into the haze of a nostalgic fashion parade. Although Streisand&#x27;s liberated Jewish lady is implausible, and emphasises the period setting as just so much dressing, Redford&#x27;s Fitzgerald-type character...is an intriguing trailer for his later &quot;Great Gatsby&quot;. It&#x27;s a performance that brings more weight to the film than it deserves, often hinting at depths that are finally skated over.&quot;

Conversely, &quot;TV Guide&quot; awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it &quot;an engrossing, if occasionally ludicrous, hit tearjerker&quot; and &quot;a great campy romance.&quot;

The film holds a rating of 64% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews. The site’s critics consensus states: &quot;&quot;The Way We Were&quot; isn&#x27;t politically confrontational enough for its story of ideological opposites falling in love to feel authentic, but Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford&#x27;s beaming star power gives this melodrama romantic lift.&quot;

===50th Anniversary Extended Cut===
Barbra Streisand&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Name is Barbra&quot; contains an account of her efforts to release an extended cut of &quot;The Way We Were&quot; on its 50th anniversary release in 2023. Two key scenes are included in an alternate version of the film on Blu-ray. One has Hubbell telling Katie that her college comrade in the Young Communists League has informed on her to the HUAC committee. Although Hubbell expresses he will stand up for Katie in the scene, she realizes that she must divorce him in order to save his career. She asks him only to stay with her until their child is born.

In the second scene, Katie drives through the UCLA campus and sees a young woman, much like herself in her college days, giving a speech against the college demanding loyalty oaths from their professors. Katie at first is elated and then, after the crowd mocks the young speaker, she is in tears, realizing how much she has strayed from her activist roots under the same kind of ridicule.

As Streisand tells it, Pollack was under pressure from Columbia to tone down the political theme of the film. Richard Nixon, who had been involved in the HUAC hearings, was president at the time, and the studio thought the political plot would jeopardize the commercial success of the film. Pollack and Streisand talk about the deleted scenes in a 1999 documentary about the making of the film, &quot;The Way We Were: Looking Back&quot;, in which the scenes are shown.

===Awards and nominations===
==Pop culture==
The 1979 comedy &quot;The Jerk&quot; includes Marie (Bernadette Peters) distressed over the demise of her relationship, sharing that she &quot;just heard a song on the radio that reminded me of the way we were.&quot; When asked the song title, she sobbingly confirms &quot;The Way We Were.&quot;

In Gilda Radner&#x27;s 1980 concert film &quot;Gilda Live&quot;, the character Lisa Loopner performs &quot;The Way We Were&quot; on the piano. Loopner says of the film &quot;It&#x27;s about a Jewish woman with a big nose and her blond boyfriend who move to Hollywood, and it&#x27;s during the blacklist and it puts a strain on their relationship.&quot;

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has evoked the film in three episode titles: &quot;The Way We Was&quot; (1991), &quot;The Way We Weren&#x27;t&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Wayz We Were&quot; (2021).

In season one of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, Lorelei attempts to guess Dean&#x27;s darkest secret is that he secretly wanted Robert Redford to dump his wife and children for Barbra Streisand. Dean admits that he has not seen &quot;The Way We Were&quot;. In another episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, Lorelei tells Sookie that she is reminded of &quot;The Way We Were&quot; because she hid from Luke the fact that she had lunch with Christopher. In season five of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, Lorelei calls Luke after they have broken up and tells him that she was thinking about &quot;The Way We Were&quot; and reminded him of how Katie called Hubbell after they had broken up and asked him to come sit with her because he was her best friend and she needed her best friend.

On the show &quot;Friends&quot;, Rachel Green lists &quot;The Way We Were&quot; as the most romantic movie of all time.

In &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, Carrie uses &quot;The Way We Were&quot; as an analogy for her relationship with Big. The girls proceed to sing the film&#x27;s theme song, and later, when Carrie bumps into Big outside his engagement party, she quotes a line from the film.

The Way We Were features in the 2024 movie &quot;This Is Me... Now: A Love Story&quot;, a movie created and written by Jennifer Lopez and Matt Walton and released alongside album of similar titled album also released in 2024 &quot;This Is Me... Now&quot; and directed by Dave Meyers (director).

<text>Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams is a 1973 American Technicolor drama film directed by Gilbert Cates and written by Stewart Stern, starring Joanne Woodward, Martin Balsam, and Sylvia Sidney. It tells the story of a New York City housewife who rethinks her relationships with her husband, her children, and her mother.

&quot;Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams&quot; garnered two nominations at the 46th Academy Awards – Best Actress (Woodward) and Best Supporting Actress (Sidney).

==Plot==
Rita Walden is a depressed, middle-aged New Yorker. Always tired, Rita is prone to nightmares, and when she does dream more pleasant thoughts, they are of her childhood on the family farm. In her mind, she settled for second best when she married her ophthalmologist husband, Harry, as she still thinks about what life would have been like with the older farm boy on whom she had a crush at age 12½. She is constantly bickering with her mother, her sister Betty, and her grown-up daughter Anna, who has issues of her own. Rita is estranged from her son Bobby; she is in denial about his homosexual orientation. After Rita&#x27;s mother dies suddenly, Rita is on the verge of a nervous breakdown in dealing with her mother&#x27;s estate, especially when the family talks about selling her beloved farm, which she still intends to pass on to Bobby. Harry thinks that a European vacation would help Rita clear her mind, with the possibility of visiting Bobby, who is currently living in Amsterdam. Although Rita faces some crises on the trip, many of her conflicts do ease after she sees Harry revisit Bastogne for the first time since his days in World War II.

<doc id="225481" wikidata="Q916431" url="?curid=225481" title="Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore">
<text>Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore is a 1974 American romantic comedy drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Robert Getchell. It stars Ellen Burstyn as a widow who travels with her preteen son across the Southwestern United States in search of a better life. Kris Kristofferson, Billy &quot;Green&quot; Bush, Diane Ladd, Valerie Curtin, Lelia Goldoni, Vic Tayback, Jodie Foster, Alfred Lutter, and Harvey Keitel appear in supporting roles.

The film premiered at the 27th Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or, and it was released theatrically on December 9, 1974, by Warner Bros. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $21 million on a $1.8 million budget. At the 47th Academy Awards, Burstyn won Best Actress, and Ladd and Getchell were nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Best Original Screenplay.

==Plot==
In Socorro, New Mexico, Alice Hyatt&#x27;s husband, Donald, a Coca-Cola delivery driver, is killed on the job in a traffic accident. A former singer, Alice sells most of her belongings, intending to take her son, Tommy, to her childhood home of Monterey, California, where she hopes to pursue the singing career she abandoned when she married Donald.

Their financial situation forces them to take temporary lodgings in Phoenix, Arizona, where she finds work as a lounge singer. She meets Ben, a younger, seemingly unmarried man who charms her into a sexual relationship that comes to a sudden end when his wife, Rita, confronts Alice. Ben breaks into Alice&#x27;s apartment while Rita is there and physically assaults Rita in front of Alice. He also threatens Alice and smashes up her apartment. Fearing for their safety, Alice and Tommy quickly leave town.

Having spent most of what little money they had on their escape, Alice takes a job as a waitress in Tucson, Arizona, at a local diner owned by Mel. There, she bonds with her fellow servers—independent, no-nonsense, outspoken Flo and quiet, timid, incompetent Vera—and meets divorced local rancher David. He quickly becomes enamored of Alice, who is wary of pursuing another relationship but begins to warm to him as he establishes a paternal relationship with Tommy.

Their relationship is threatened when David uses physical force to discipline Tommy. Although Alice still dreams of going to Monterey, they reconcile. David offers to sell his ranch and move to Monterey, but in the end, Alice decides to stay in Tucson with him.

==Production==
Ellen Burstyn was still in the midst of filming &quot;The Exorcist&quot; when Warner Bros. executives expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn recalled: &quot;It was early in the woman&#x27;s movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different ... I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman&#x27;s point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; ... When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Bros. and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn&#x27;t know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said &#x27;Go look at a movie called &quot;Mean Streets&quot; and see what you think.&#x27; It hadn&#x27;t been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what ... &quot;Alice&quot; needed, because [it] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty.&quot;

Burstyn described her collaboration with Scorsese, making his first Hollywood studio production, as &quot;one of the best experiences I&#x27;ve ever had&quot;. He agreed with her that the film should have a message. &quot;It&#x27;s a picture about emotions and feelings and relationships and people in chaos,&quot; he said. &quot;We felt like charting all that and showing the differences and showing people making terrible mistakes ruining their lives and then realizing it and trying to push back when everything is crumbling – without getting into soap opera. We opened ourselves up to a lot of experimentation.&quot;

The part of Alice was offered to Shirley MacLaine, who turned it down. In a 2005 interview, she said she regretted that decision.

Scorsese&#x27;s casting director auditioned 300 boys for the role of Tommy before they discovered Alfred Lutter. &quot;I met the kid in my hotel room and he was kind of quiet and shy,&quot; Scorsese said. But when he paired him with Burstyn and suggested she deviate from the script, he held his own. &quot;Usually, when we were improvising with the kids, they would either freeze and look down or go right back to the script. But this kid, you couldn&#x27;t shut him up.&quot;

The film was shot on location predominantly in and around Tucson, but some scenes were shot in Amado, Arizona, and Phoenix. A Mel&#x27;s Diner still exists in Phoenix.

The soundtrack includes &quot;All the Way from Memphis&quot; by Mott the Hoople; &quot;Roll Away the Stone&quot; by Leon Russell; &quot;Daniel&quot; by Elton John; &quot;Jeepster&quot; by T-Rex; and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; by Dolly Parton. During her lounge act, Alice sings &quot;Where or When&quot; by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart; &quot;When Your Lover Has Gone&quot; by Einar Aaron Swan; &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Allie Wrubel and Herb Magidson; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Crush on You&quot; by George and Ira Gershwin. In a film clip from &quot;Coney Island&quot;, Betty Grable is heard singing &quot;Cuddle Up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine&quot; by Otto A. Harbach and Karl Hoschna; and in a film clip from &quot;Hello Frisco, Hello&quot;, Alice Faye performs &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot; by Harry Warren and Mack Gordon.

The opening of the film was shot in one day using a set that cost $85,000 to build.

The first cut of the film was three hours and sixteen minutes long.

==Reception==
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;fine, moving, frequently hilarious tale&quot;, and wrote that &quot;the center of the movie and giving it a visible sensibility is Miss Burstyn, one of the few actresses at work today ... who is able to seem appealing, tough, intelligent, funny, and bereft, all at approximately the same moment ... Two other performances must be noted, those of Diane Ladd and Valerie Curtin ... Their marvelous contributions in small roles are a measure of the film&#x27;s quality and of Mr. Scorsese&#x27;s fully realized talents as one of the best of the new American filmmakers.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called the film &quot;one of the most perceptive, funny, occasionally painful portraits of an American woman I&#x27;ve seen.&quot; He wrote: &quot;The movie has been both attacked and defended on feminist grounds, but I think it belongs somewhere outside ideology, maybe in the area of contemporary myth and romance.&quot; Ebert placed the film third of his list of the best films of 1975 (even though it was released in December 1974).

Judith Crist praised Burstyn for &quot;making us care about her in all her incredibilities, stripping the character to its essential warmth as a woman, concerns as a mother, dependencies as a wife, and yearnings as an individual.&quot; But she criticized Scorsese&#x27;s direction, writing that he was &quot;putting on a camera show of his own, the handheld pursuit of the image lending an exhausting freneticism to what is melodrama enough on its own.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Alice&quot; is thoroughly enjoyable: funny, absorbing, intelligent even when you don&#x27;t believe in what&#x27;s going on—when the issues it raises get all fouled up.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; rated the film three out of four stars, calling it &quot;effective but uneven&quot; with performances that &quot;cannot conceal the storyline&#x27;s shortcomings.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a distended bore&quot;, adding that it &quot;takes a group of well-cast film players and largely wastes them on a smaller-than-life film—one of those &#x27;little people&#x27; dramas that makes one despise little people.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars out of four, writing, &quot;[t]he characters aren&#x27;t real, the situations in which they are placed aren&#x27;t real, and, as a result, one cares little how the alleged relationships develop.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Burstyn&#x27;s performance &quot;highly charged and sympathetic&quot;, and Ladd &quot;wonderful&quot;. But he felt the film was &quot;seemingly uncertain whether to be a stylized and updating revision of the romantic comedy modes of the late &#x27;30s or a rough-and-tumble piece of social realism flavored with bitter comedy.&quot; Similarly, Molly Haskell of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; felt the film was inconsistent in its attempt to &quot;make a &#x27;woman&#x27;s picture&#x27; that will satisfy contemporary audiences&#x27; hunger for a heroine of some stature and significance, while at the same time allowing Scorsese to pay ironic tribute to the tear-jerkers and spunky showbiz sagas of the past and such demigoddesses as Alice Faye and Betty Grable.&quot; Overall, she felt, &quot;the fault is largely that too many cooks have been allowed to contribute their ingredients (they&#x27;re called &#x27;life moments&#x27; and the result is inorganic soup), without a guiding intelligence.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92%, based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; finds Martin Scorsese wielding a somewhat gentler palette than usual, with generally absorbing results.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Television adaptation==

The film inspired the sitcom &quot;Alice&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS from 1976 to 1985. The only member of the film cast to reprise his role was Vic Tayback as Mel (though his diner was moved to Phoenix). Lutter portrayed Tommy in the pilot episode but was replaced by Philip McKeon for the series. Ladd joined the show later in its run, but in a different role than she played in the film (Ladd replaced the Flo character in the series as a character named Belle). Linda Lavin took the role of Alice in the series after Burstyn said she wouldn&#x27;t do television. Beth Howland played Vera in the series. The character of Flo was later spun off into yet another series, &quot;Flo&quot;.

==Home media==
Warner Home Video released the film on Region 1 DVD on August 17, 2004. It is in anamorphic widescreen with audio tracks in English and French and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Bonus features include commentary by Scorsese, Burstyn, and Kristofferson, and &quot;Second Chances&quot;, a background look at the making of the film.

==Book==
In 2019, BearManor published &quot;Media Alice: Life Behind the Counter in Mel&#x27;s Greasy Spoon (A Guide to the Feature Film, the TV Series, and More)&quot;, a book chronicling the development of the film and its spin-off television series.

<doc id="225482" wikidata="Q230015" url="?curid=225482" title="Jennie Garth">
<text>Jennifer Eve Garth (born April 3, 1972) is an American actress. She is known for starring as Kelly Taylor throughout the &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; franchise and Val Tyler on the sitcom &quot;What I Like About You&quot; (2002–06). In 2012, she starred in her own reality show, &quot;Jennie Garth: A Little Bit Country&quot; on CMT. Her memoir titled &quot;Deep Thoughts From a Hollywood Blonde&quot; was published by New American Library on April 1, 2014. 

==Early life==
Garth was born in Urbana, Illinois, to John and Carolyn Garth. The youngest of seven children (though their only child together), Garth spent much of her youth on a 25-acre horse ranch between Sadorus and Arcola, Illinois. For a time, the family stayed in Tuscola, Illinois; but eventually, they settled in Glendale, Arizona, when Garth was around 13 years old. She studied dance and modeled, and was soon discovered at a local talent competition by Randy James, a Hollywood scout and manager. She attended Greenway High School as a freshman and transferred to Apollo High School in her sophomore year. Determined to become an actress, Garth would receive audition materials from Los Angeles that she would work on with Jean Fowler, a local acting coach. She left school during her junior year to work in Los Angeles with James and later obtained her high school diploma in California.

==Career==

=== 1989–2001: Career beginnings and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; ===
In 1990, she landed the role of Kelly Taylor in the series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Throughout the series, Garth&#x27;s character went through occasional rough times and dealt with difficult issues in her personal life and with her family. Garth appears in all ten seasons of the show. She directed two episodes which was the second most of any cast member, and was the only female cast member of the show to direct. She won a Young Artist Award and was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for the role. She was also instrumental in launching the spin-offs &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and &quot;90210&quot;, with the character of Kelly becoming a continuity icon by appearing in most franchise episodes. In 1993, she released a workout video titled &quot;Body In Progress&quot;.

Her successful role on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; opened the door to several lead roles in made-for-TV films in the 1990s, including &quot;Danielle Steel&#x27;s Star&quot; (1993), &quot;Without Consent&quot; (1994), &quot;Lies of the Heart: The Story of Laurie Kellogg&quot; (1994), &quot;Falling for You&quot; (1995), and &quot;An Unfinished Affair&quot; (1996). She also had minor and supporting roles in the theatrical films &quot;Telling You&quot; (1998), &quot;My Brother&#x27;s War&quot; (1997), and &quot;Power 98&quot; (1996). Garth also appeared at the WWF&#x27;s WrestleMania X pay-per-view in 1994 as the guest timekeeper for the show&#x27;s main event.

Garth ranked No. 59 on the &quot;FHM&quot; 100 Sexiest Women of 2000, and #93 on the magazine&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Women of 2001.

=== 2002–2013: Continued television success with &quot;What I Like About You&quot; ===
In 2002, Garth co-starred with Amanda Bynes in the WB sitcom &quot;What I Like About You&quot; as Valerie Tyler. She and Bynes appeared on the show for all four seasons. The show centered around the Tyler sisters&#x27; relationships, friendships, and romances. In 2003, she starred in the television movies &quot;The Last Cowboy&quot; and the Christmas family drama &quot;Secret Santa&quot;, playing a journalist.

==Personal life==
Garth was married to musician Daniel B. Clark from 1994 to 1996.

In 1995, Garth met her second husband, actor Peter Facinelli, while filming the movie &quot;An Unfinished Affair&quot;. Garth and Facinelli married on January 20, 2001, in a traditional Roman Catholic wedding mass. They have three daughters; born in 1997, 2002, and 2006. In March 2012, Facinelli filed for divorce. The divorce was finalized in June 2013. Although there was no requirement to do so, Garth had converted to Catholicism when she married Facinelli.

Garth began dating actor David Abrams in the fall of 2014, starting with a blind date. They got engaged in April 2015, and married on July 11, 2015. Garth and Abrams separated in 2017.

In 2002, at age 30, Garth was diagnosed with a mitral valve prolapse and leaky heart valve, a condition she stated would require monitoring for the rest of her life. She revealed the diagnosis in 2009. &quot;Down the road it’s something that could get more complicated or it could not,&quot; she commented. &quot;People have had valve replacements and that kind of thing … but I’m prepared, that’s the key.&quot; She revealed in her memoir that she started suffering from anxiety at age 19, saying &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say that I ever stepped over the line into full-blown agoraphobia, but I would say I definitely came close.&quot;

<text>Diahann Carroll ( ; born Carol Diann Johnson; July 17, 1935 – October 4, 2019) was an American actress, singer, model, and activist. Carroll was the recipient of numerous nominations and awards for her stage and screen performances, including a Tony Award in 1962, Golden Globe Award in 1968, and five Emmy Award nominations.

Carroll rose to prominence in some of the earliest major studio films to feature black casts, including the classic movie musicals &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954) and &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1959). She received an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for her title role in the romantic comedy-drama film &quot;Claudine&quot; (1974). Carroll&#x27;s other notable film credits include &quot;Paris Blues&quot; (1961), &quot;The Split&quot; (1968), &quot;Eve&#x27;s Bayou&quot; (1997), and &quot;Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters First 100 Years&quot; (1999).

She starred in the title role in &quot;Julia&quot; (1968-1971), for which she received a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Star – Female. The series was the first on American television to star a black woman in a non-stereotypical role. In the show Carroll played a nurse and single mother. She played the role of Dominique Deveraux, a mixed-race diva, in the prime time soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; from 1984 to 1987. She also had roles in &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot;, and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

Carroll made her Broadway debut playing Ottilie Alias Violet in the musical &quot;House of Flowers&quot; (1954). She became the first African-American woman to win the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role as Barbara Woodruff in the musical &quot;No Strings&quot; (1962).

== Early years ==

Carol Diann Johnson was born in the Bronx, New York City, on July 17, 1935, to John Johnson, a subway conductor, and Mabel (Faulk), a nurse. While Carroll was still an infant, the family moved to Harlem, where she grew up except for a brief period in which her parents had left her with an aunt in North Carolina. She attended Music and Art High School, and was a classmate of Billy Dee Williams. In many interviews about her childhood, Carroll recalls her parents&#x27; support, and their enrolling her in dance, singing, and modeling classes. By the time Carroll was 15, she was modeling for &quot;Ebony&quot;. &quot;She also began entering television contests, including &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts,&quot; under the name Diahann Carroll.&quot; After graduating from high school, she attended New York University, where she majored in sociology, &quot;but she left before graduating to pursue a show-business career, promising her family that if the career did not materialize after two years, she would return to college.&quot;

== Career ==
Carroll&#x27;s big break came at the age of 18, when she appeared as a contestant on the DuMont Television Network program, &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot;, hosted by Dennis James. On the show, which aired January 8, 1954, she took the $1,000 top prize for a rendition of the Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein song, &quot;Why Was I Born?&quot; She went on to win the following four weeks. Engagements at Manhattan&#x27;s Café Society and Latin Quarter nightclubs soon followed.

Carroll&#x27;s film debut was a supporting role in &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954), as a friend to the sultry lead character played by Dorothy Dandridge. That same year, she starred in the Broadway musical, &quot;House of Flowers&quot;. A few years later, she played Clara in the film version of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1959), but her character&#x27;s singing parts were dubbed by opera singer Loulie Jean Norman. The following year, Carroll made a guest appearance in the series &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, in the episode &quot;Sing a Song of Murder&quot; (1960). In the next two years, she starred with Sidney Poitier, Paul Newman, and Joanne Woodward in the film &quot;Paris Blues&quot; (1961) and won the 1962 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical (the first time for a Black woman) for portraying Barbara Woodruff in the Samuel A. Taylor and Richard Rodgers musical &quot;No Strings&quot;. Twelve years later, she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her starring role alongside James Earl Jones in the film &quot;Claudine&quot; (1974), which part had been written specifically for actress Diana Sands (who had made guest appearances on &quot;Julia&quot; as Carroll&#x27;s cousin Sara), but shortly before filming was to begin, Sands learned she was terminally ill with cancer. Sands attempted to carry on with the role, but as filming began, she became too ill to continue and recommended her friend Carroll take over the role. Sands died in September 1973, before the film&#x27;s release in April 1974.
Carroll is known for her titular role in the television series &quot;Julia&quot; (1968–71), which made her the first African-American actress in a television series starring role that was not of a domestic worker. That role won her the Golden Globe Award for Best TV Star – Female for its first year, and a nomination for an Primetime Emmy Award in 1969. Some of Carroll&#x27;s earlier work also included appearances on shows hosted by Johnny Carson, Judy Garland, Merv Griffin, Jack Paar, and Ed Sullivan, and on &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; variety show. In 1984, Carroll joined the nighttime soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; at the end of its fourth season as the mixed-race jet set diva Dominique Deveraux, Blake Carrington&#x27;s half-sister. Her high-profile role on &quot;Dynasty&quot; also reunited her with her schoolmate Billy Dee Williams, who briefly played her onscreen husband Brady Lloyd. Carroll remained on the show and made several appearances on its short-lived spin-off, &quot;The Colbys&quot; until she departed at the end of the seventh season in 1987. In 1989, she began the recurring role of Marion Gilbert, Whitley Gilbert&#x27;s mother, in &quot;A Different World&quot;, for which she received her third Emmy nomination that same year.

In 1991, Carroll portrayed Eleanor Potter, the doting, concerned, and protective wife of Jimmy Potter (portrayed by Chuck Patterson), in the musical drama film &quot;The Five Heartbeats&quot; (1991), also featuring actor and musician Robert Townsend and Michael Wright. She reunited with Billy Dee Williams again in 1995, portraying his character&#x27;s wife Mrs. Greyson in &quot;Lonesome Dove: The Series&quot;. The following year, Carroll starred as the self-loving,egotistical,corrupt,manipulative and deceptive silent movie star Norma Desmond in the Canadian production of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical version of the film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. In 2001, Carroll made her animation debut in &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot;, in which she voiced Queen La, ruler of the ancient city of Opar.

In 2006, Carroll appeared in several episodes of the television medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; as Jane Burke, the demanding mother of Dr. Preston Burke. From 2008 to 2014, she appeared on USA Network&#x27;s series &quot;White Collar&quot; in the recurring role of June, the savvy widow who rents out her guest room to Neal Caffrey. In 2010, Carroll was featured in UniGlobe Entertainment&#x27;s breast cancer docudrama titled &quot;1 a Minute,&quot; and appeared as Nana in two Lifetime movie adaptations of Patricia Cornwell novels: &quot;At Risk&quot; and &quot;The Front&quot;.

In 2013, Carroll was present on stage at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards to briefly speak about being the first African-American nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. She was quoted as saying about Kerry Washington, nominated for &quot;Scandal&quot;, &quot;she better get this award.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Carroll was married four times. Her father boycotted the ceremony for her first wedding in 1956, to record producer Monte Kay, which was presided over by Adam Clayton Powell Jr. at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. The marriage ended in 1962. Carroll gave birth to her daughter, Suzanne Kay (born September 9, 1960), who became a journalist and screenwriter.

In 1959, Carroll began a nine-year affair with the married actor Sidney Poitier. In her autobiography, Carroll said Poitier persuaded her to divorce her husband and said he would leave his wife to be with her. While she proceeded with her divorce, Poitier did not keep his part of the bargain. Eventually he divorced his wife. According to Poitier, their relationship ended because he wanted to live with Carroll for six months without her daughter present so he would not be &quot;jumping from one marriage straight into another.&quot; She refused.
Carroll dated and was engaged to British television host and producer David Frost from 1970 until 1973. In February 1973, Carroll surprised the press by marrying Las Vegas boutique owner Fred Glusman. After four months of marriage, Glusman filed for divorce in June 1973. Carroll filed a response, but did not contest the divorce, which was finalized two months later. Glusman was reportedly physically abusive.

On May 25, 1975, Carroll, then aged 39, married Robert DeLeon (1950–1977), the 24-year-old managing editor of &quot;Jet&quot; magazine in New York City. They met when DeLeon assigned himself to a cover story on Carroll about her 1975 Oscar nomination for &quot;Claudine&quot;. DeLeon had a daughter, Monica, from a previous marriage. Carroll moved to Chicago where &quot;Jet&quot; was headquartered, but DeLeon soon quit his job so the couple relocated to Oakland. Carroll was widowed when DeLeon was killed in a car crash in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1977. Carroll&#x27;s fourth and final marriage was to singer Vic Damone in 1987. The union, which Carroll admitted was turbulent, had a legal separation in 1991, reconciliation, and divorce in 1996.

=== Charitable work ===
Carroll was a founding member of the Celebrity Action Council, a volunteer group of celebrity women who served the women&#x27;s outreach of the Los Angeles Mission, working with women in rehabilitation from problems with alcohol, drugs, or prostitution. She helped to form the group along with other female television personalities including Mary Frann, Linda Gray, Donna Mills, and Joan Van Ark.

== Illness, death, and memorial ==
Carroll was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. She said the diagnosis &quot;stunned&quot; her, because there was no family history of breast cancer, and she had always led a healthy lifestyle. She underwent nine weeks of radiation therapy and had been clear for years after the diagnosis. She frequently spoke of the need for early detection and prevention of the disease. She died from natural causes at her home in West Hollywood, California, on October 4, 2019, at the age of 84. Carroll also suffered from another form of cancer and dementia at the time of her death, which was unrelated, though actor Marc Copage, who played her character&#x27;s son on &quot;Julia&quot;, said that she did not appear to show serious signs of cognitive decline as of late 2017.

<doc id="225485" wikidata="Q313311" url="?curid=225485" title="Brian Austin Green">
<text>Brian Austin Green (born Brian Green; July 15, 1973) is an American actor, best known for his portrayal of David Silver on the television series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1990–2000). Green was also a series regular on television shows &quot;Freddie&quot; (2005–2006), &quot;&quot; (2008–2009), &quot;Wedding Band&quot; (2012–2013), and &quot;Anger Management&quot; (2012–2014).

==Early life==
Green was born in Van Nuys, California, the son of Joyce and George Green. He has some Scottish ancestry. His middle name, &quot;Austin&quot;, was added to differentiate himself from another actor when he joined the Screen Actor&#x27;s Guild as a child.

==Career==
Prior to his role on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, Green had a recurring role for three seasons (1986–1989) on the CBS primetime soap opera &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, playing the role of Brian Cunningham, the son of Abby Cunningham Ewing (Donna Mills). He reprised his role in the television miniseries &quot;Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac&quot; (1997). He appeared in the 1987 pilot of &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; as Adam Montcrief.

Producer Aaron Spelling stated that Green was cast as David Silver because of their similar personalities. The character was often scripted to reflect Green&#x27;s own interests. As the series progressed, the character began to experiment with hip hop music and DJing, as did Green himself. In 1996, Green dropped &quot;Austin&quot; from his professional name and attempted a career as a rapper, releasing one album, &quot;One Stop Carnival&quot;, produced by The Pharcyde member Slimkid3. In the 1990s, Green was a guest star on &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Mad TV&quot;, &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot;, &quot;Malibu Shores&quot;, &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; and &quot;Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac&quot;.

Green appeared briefly in the multiple award-winning Showtime drama series &quot;Resurrection Blvd.&quot; as Luke Bonner (2001–2004), a police officer attending law school. He had a cameo on &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; where he met Megan Fox; they started dating in 2004. He appeared on the ABC sitcom &quot;Freddie&quot; (2005) starring Freddie Prinze, Jr. He was a guest star on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He also appeared alongside former &quot;90210&quot; cast member Ian Ziering in the Tony Scott film &quot;Domino&quot; as parodies of themselves.
Green appeared in a horror short called &quot;Grace&quot;, which was set around a miscarriage gone bad, and features &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; actress Liza Weil as his love interest. It premiered at the Fangoria Weekend of Horrors on June 2, 2006, and was reworked as a full-length feature film (2009). He was a guest star on &quot;George Lopez&quot; in 2006 as Chris.

Green played Derek Reese in &quot;&quot;, a Resistance fighter sent to the past by the future John Connor. The character is the older brother of Kyle Reese (John Connor&#x27;s father) and paternal uncle of John. Green was a recurring character in season 1 but became a regular at the start of season 2, following a positive response from critics and fans. His character is killed by a Terminator in the penultimate episode, but another Derek from an alternate timeline is introduced in the series finale and would have remained on the show if it had been renewed for a third season.
Green guest-starred on the season 7 finale of &quot;&quot; as Anthony Green. Green was cast in The CW&#x27;s new drama pilot &quot;Body Politic&quot;, along with Minka Kelly, Gabrielle Union, and Jason Dohring. The series was not picked up for fall 2009. Green said in an interview that he was co-producing a big screen adaptation of &quot;Fathom&quot;, starring Megan Fox. On September 27, 2009, Green made a guest appearance on the television series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in a skit involving girlfriend (later his wife) Megan Fox. In the skit Green played a version of the Transformer Bumblebee in which Bumblebee is merely a man wearing a Bumblebee mask. Green was cast as Clay in &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;″s seventh season. Green then left the cast because of scheduling conflicts and the role was then given to Robert Buckley; Green instead starred as superhero Callan in the Patrick Durham-directed movie &quot;Cross&quot;, which was released to DVD and download in May 2011.

In 2009, Green was cast as Metallo in &quot;Smallville&quot;. He appeared in three episodes in the ninth season between 2009 and 2010, the first being the ninth-season premiere episode &quot;Savior&quot;. The character is a war-time reporter, similar to the Silver Age John Corben. As a back-story for this version, he had been recently stationed in Afghanistan. When he meets Lois Lane, he expresses his distaste for vigilantes, particularly &quot;the Blur&quot; (Clark Kent) due to the hero saving a prison bus only for a convict to escape and slay his sister. After being struck in a hit and run, Corben awoke to find himself possessing cybernetic enhancements - including an artificial heart powered by kryptonite. After kidnapping Lois Lane as bait, the villain was confronted and defeated by Clark Kent. It was subsequently revealed in the episode &quot;Conspiracy&quot; that Zod&#x27;s disciples were behind Corben&#x27;s revival. Corben is &quot;reactivated&quot; in the episode &quot;Upgrade&quot; after Luthorcorp scientists are able to correct the initial design flaw in the Kryptonite heart that causes an adrenal overload and resulting psychosis. Though Green had expressed willingness to reprise the character in the 10th and final season, the character was portrayed by a body double for his final appearance in the episode &quot;Prophecy&quot; - presumably due to budget and the cameo nature of the appearance. Green&#x27;s likeness would be used however for the character&#x27;s appearance in the Season Eleven comic continuation.

In 2010, Green appeared in a multi-episode story arc on the ABC series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. He played Keith Watson, Bree&#x27;s contractor and lover for the first part of the season.

In 2012, Green had a guest appearance in the sitcom &quot;Anger Management&quot; playing Sean, the boyfriend of Charlie&#x27;s ex-wife, Jen in the first episode of the show. This episode broke a ratings record with 5.74 million viewers on its series debut night and ranks as the most-watched sitcom premiere in cable history. He returned to the show in the episode &quot;Charlie Breaks Up With Kate&quot;, and was promoted to series regular in June 2013.

Green was a guest star in the finale episode of the second season of &quot;Happy Endings&quot;. He played Chris, who meets dateless Penny via Skype. He returned in the third-season premiere &quot;Cazsh Dummy Spillionaires&quot;. In the same year, Green starred in the television series &quot;Wedding Band&quot;, about a group of friends who perform at weddings. In the TBS comedy, Green plays Tommy, the frontman for Mother of the Bride, a group of four buddies who aren&#x27;t ready to give up the dream of being rock stars. On January 22, 2013, TBS cancelled the series after one season because of low ratings.

In 2020, Green competed in season four of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Giraffe&quot;. He was eliminated in his second appearance. Robin Thicke joined him in his encore of Kool and the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Get Down on It&quot;. He also served as a panelist on its spin-off series &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot;. In 2023, Green competed on the fifth season of the Australian version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Crash Test Dummy&quot;. He was eliminated in the premiere episode.

In September 2021, Green was announced as one of the celebrities competing on season 30 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Green&#x27;s dance partner was his girlfriend, Sharna Burgess. He was the third celebrity to be eliminated from the show, ultimately placing 13th.

==Personal life==
Green won the celebrity portion of the Grand Prix of Long Beach in early 2010.

In April 2017, Green created a podcast titled &quot;With Brian Austin Green&quot;. The show went on indefinite hiatus in 2022, with Green signing an exclusive deal with iHeart Radio to start a new podcast &quot;Old-ish&quot; in 2023 alongside Burgess and Randy Spelling.

In June 2022, Green revealed that he has suffered from ulcerative colitis.

===Relationships===

Green dated his &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; co-star Tiffani Thiessen from 1992 to 1995.

In 1999, Green started dating his &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; castmate Vanessa Marcil, whom he met on set. The two became engaged in July 2001 and had a son born in 2002. They planned to wed that year, but ended their relationship in 2003.

In 2004, Green began dating actress Megan Fox, having first met on the set of &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; when he was 30 years old and she was 18. Fox said Green was initially hesitant to enter a relationship with her due to the age difference. Fox said, &quot;I had to convince him that I was slightly more responsible and well-spoken and had other things to bring to the table besides being 18.&quot; They became engaged in 2006 but broke off their engagement in February 2009. Later that year, their home was targeted by a group of fashion-motivated criminals known as &quot;The Bling Ring&quot;, who initially targeted them to steal Fox&#x27;s designer clothes.

In June 2010, Green and Fox announced they were engaged again, and several days later on June 24, the two wed at the Four Seasons resort on the island of Hawaii. They have three sons together, born in 2012, 2014, and 2016. Fox filed for divorce from Green on August 21, 2015, a few days after the couple announced their separation. They reconciled in early 2016. On April 25, 2019, Fox filed to dismiss the divorce in Los Angeles, California. In May 2020, Green announced that he and Fox had separated after nearly 10 years of marriage. In November 2020, Fox filed for divorce from Green for a second time. They finalized their divorce on October 15, 2021.

Green has been dating Australian professional dancer Sharna Burgess since October 2020. They announced they were expecting their first child together on February 4, 2022. Their son was born on June 28, 2022. On September 22, 2023, the couple announced their engagement.

===Philanthropy===
Both Green and ex-wife Megan Fox are supporters of Generosity Water, and have funded the creation of over ten water wells for the organization.

Through his podcast, Green organized a charity event to benefit the organization on September 1, 2018. A second charity event took place on August 31, 2019 - and was attended by many of Green&#x27;s former &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; co-stars.

In 2021, Green and girlfriend Sharna Burgess took part in the &quot;Search4Smiles&quot; campaign supporting the Trueheart Search Engine, which donates 80% of their profits to charity.

===Paparazzi lawsuit===
In March 2012, photographer Delbert Shaw sued Green and ex-wife Fox in Los Angeles County Superior Court for allegedly assaulting him after he took photographs of the couple while Green and Fox were vacationing in Hawaii in 2010. In June 2012, Green said he was defending himself against Shaw and that Fox should not be included in the lawsuit.

<doc id="225487" wikidata="Q1440046" url="?curid=225487" title="Claudine (film)">
<text>Claudine is a 1974 American romantic comedy-drama film, directed by John Berry. &quot;Claudine&quot; was written by Lester Pine and Tina Pine, produced by Third World Cinema, and distributed by 20th Century Fox, starring James Earl Jones, Diahann Carroll, and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs. The film was released on April 22, 1974, grossing about $6 million, a modest hit for the times. It was praised for showing a new dimension in black cinema during the height of blaxploitation.

==Plot==
The film tells the story of Claudine Price, a single black Harlem mother, living on welfare with six children, who finds love with a garbage collector, Rupert &quot;Roop&quot; Marshall. The pair&#x27;s relationship is complicated by their poverty, the restrictions of the welfare system and the hostility of her children, particularly eldest son Charles, who believes that Roop will leave their mother just like her previous husbands had.
When Rupert is invited inside Claudine&#x27;s shabby apartment, the children are rude and vulgar towards him.

Throughout the film, Miss Kabak, a social worker, visits Claudine at her home and asks her if she is employed and if she is dating anyone. Claudine always claims to be unemployed and single, to make sure to get the maximum amount of benefits, which she desperately needs. If Claudine has a job or dates anyone and receives gifts from her boyfriend, the social worker has to deduct any money or gifts from her benefits, forcing Claudine to lie. Having a husband would be even worse, and cause her to lose her benefits altogether. Claudine does have a job as a housekeeper, but her meager wages will not support the family without the welfare benefits. Adding to Claudine&#x27;s stress and financial woes, her teenage daughter gets pregnant by a young man with no prospects for taking care of her or a baby.

Despite these problems, Claudine and Roop&#x27;s relationship continues and the children warm up to him. Just before he is to announce his engagement to Claudine to the kids, Rupert is served papers for a court order relating to underpayment of child support of his own children; his work wages are garnished to pay the difference. Rupert is so upset that he disappears for a couple of days and loses contact with everyone. He moves out of his apartment, does not show up to work, and does not show up to the Father&#x27;s Day celebration the children had prepared for him. Charles eventually finds Roop drunk at a bar and confronts him. Charles is angry at Rupert because he left his mother without any explanation and the two get into a scuffle at the bar. Later, Rupert shows up outside of Claudine&#x27;s apartment, explains his absence and they reconcile.

After several hardships and debating the financial issues relating to welfare, the couple decide to marry. In the middle of the wedding, Charles runs inside the apartment with the police chasing after him for his activities at a political demonstration. The couple and the rest of the children run after Charles, leaving the ceremony, and board the police wagon. The film ends on a cheery note with the entire family, along with Rupert, walking happily hand in hand through the neighborhood.

==Cast==
==Main characters==
*Claudine Price is played by Diahann Carroll. Claudine is a loving, 36-year-old single mother of six children. She cannot raise her children without the help of the welfare program. Her children are Charles, Charlene, Paul, Patrice, Francis, and Lurlene. Claudine had been married and abandoned twice and dated two men before she meets Rupert. She lives in a small, run-down apartment in Harlem, New York. Claudine works as a housekeeper for a wealthy, older, white woman who does not seem to like Claudine very much and pays her very poorly. Claudine eventually dates Rupert, and toward the end of the movie, they get married.
*Rupert B. Marshall is played by James Earl Jones. Rupert is a cheery garbage collector who lives alone in his apartment. He meets Claudine when he stops at the house where Claudine works to pick up the garbage. He has several children from two previous marriages. He never gets to see his children but he does provide them with as much financial support as his low-paying job allows. With time, he gains the respect and attention of Claudine&#x27;s children and they finally decide to accept him into their family.
*Charles Price is Claudine&#x27;s oldest son and is played by Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs. Charles is a member of a black activist group that fights for positive social change for the black community. Charles disapproves of his mother&#x27;s relationship with Rupert because he thinks that Rupert will get Claudine pregnant and simply leave her, as his own father and others have done. Charles does not even consider the younger children his siblings because he hates the fact that Claudine had several children with different men. Therefore, one day, he confesses to his horrified mother that he has had a vasectomy because he does not want to procreate and be stuck in a situation similar to his mother&#x27;s.
*Charlene Price is Claudine&#x27;s older daughter and is played by Tamu Blackwell. Claudine erupts with violence when she discovers her daughter is concealing her pregnancy, beating with her fists and a hairbrush. Claudine is crushed that Charlene has fallen into the same trap of early pregnancy that has diminished her own life. But her disappointment is soon replaced by compassion and determination to do what is best for her daughter.

==Themes==
=== Welfare and employment ===
In the film, Claudine receives financial aid from state welfare. She receives barely enough money to provide basic necessities for herself and her six children, living in a slum-like neighborhood in Harlem. Claudine works as a housekeeper for an upper-middle class white woman but conceals this so that her benefits will not be reduced. The constant struggle of a family living in poverty is a major theme throughout the movie.

=== Marriage and family life ===
Claudine is forced to choose between the benefits her family desperately needs and her desire to form a new family with Roop. She chooses to be a single mother because of the rules of the government&#x27;s financial aid programs such as the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). Marriage will bring love and stability to herself and her family, but also will mean that her current income will be reduced below what they need. This is a major theme in the movie, which shows that, despite the stereotypes of a &quot;Welfare Queen&quot;, this mother is neither lazy nor promiscuous but rather navigating a difficult situation.

=== Systemic economic inequality ===
The third theme that occurs in the film is welfare and the black community as a whole. The welfare system, sometimes handled comically, sometimes seriously, is a constant topic of conversation in the movie. Even Claudine&#x27;s younger children are aware of what welfare is and ask Rupert if he receives assistance. The one person, other than Rupert, who clearly opposes the welfare system is Charles, Claudine&#x27;s oldest son. Charles is a member of an activist group promoting social justice for black people. Even though he understands that women like his mother face a severe struggle to break free from poverty and dependency, Charles opposes the welfare system because he believes it encourages passivity and discourages self-reliance. Charles believes in the creation of more job opportunities for black people so that they can earn money and leave the welfare system.

==Production==
=== Filming===
Production for the film began in August 1973. The location of this film was in the Harlem area Sugar Hill; Claudine&#x27;s apartment was located near Edgecombe Avenue and 142nd street. The final shot of Claudine and her family walking together with Rupert was filmed several weeks after principal photography ended. Actor Ivan Dixon of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; and &quot;Car Wash&quot; fame can be seen toward the end of the film in the crowd that follows Claudine as she hops into the police truck. He is wearing a red shirt. Dixon was a long time friend of Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones.

===Casting ===
Actress Diana Sands was originally cast as Claudine, but after only a week of filming, Sands fell ill and was not able to continue. Just before her death, Sands called Carroll and insisted that she take the role in her place. Cicely Tyson also turned down the role of Claudine.

===Soundtrack===

Curtis Mayfield wrote and produced the film&#x27;s score and soundtrack, the vocals for which are performed by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. The soundtrack for &quot;Claudine&quot; was released on Buddah Records, the group&#x27;s record label, and &quot;On &amp; On&quot;, the film&#x27;s theme song, was a #5 hit for Knight and the Pips on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart in 1974.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $3 million in North America.

===Critical response===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that while &quot;not very far removed from a typical TV sitcom ... &#x27;Claudine&#x27; is a first-rate American comedy that gives stature to a popular form. The difference between it and dozens of television comedies is the difference between interests, to say nothing of talents. It is also the first major film about black life to consider the hopes, struggles, defeats and frustrations of blacks who aren&#x27;t either supercops, supermusicians, superstuds, superpimps or superpushers.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, &quot;Carroll and Jones are accomplished players and provide the story with life and believability. Theirs is a funny and tender encounter; there&#x27;s no way you can help but want them to stay together.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;an engrossing and effective movie which is somehow able to exist simultaneously as a high-spirited romantic comedy and as a fictionalized documentary grim and angering in its implications.&quot; Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; declared it &quot;a sweet-spirited film, saddened and rollicking, full of courage.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Jones for &quot;a playful, winning performance&quot; but found the film &quot;a mishmash of situation and romantic comedy, domestic and romantic melodrama, and rather grand standing social commentary, with the action interrupted in order to permit one character or another to get a position paper off the writers&#x27; chests.&quot; Tom Milne of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; criticized the film for what he called &quot;its patronising blacks-are-really-just-like-us attitude,&quot; stating, &quot;Substitute white actors for the black cast, tone down the fashionably outspoken situations a little, and it would be just like one of those perennial Disney movies about happy families and the difficulty of living and loving in this problematic world.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Home media==
&quot;Claudine&quot; was released on DVD on January 14, 2003. On October 13, 2020, The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD, touting a new 4K restoration of the film.

<doc id="225488" wikidata="Q235575" url="?curid=225488" title="Gabrielle Carteris">
<text>Gabrielle Carteris ( ) is an American actress and trade union leader. Her best known acting role is as Andrea Zuckerman in &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.

In 2012, Carteris was elected executive vice president of SAG-AFTRA, a trade union representing over 100,000 actors and other professionals mainly in the United States. She assumed the position of acting president of the union following the death of the previous president, Ken Howard, on March 23, 2016. On April 9, 2016, Carteris was elected SAG-AFTRA president by national board to serve out the remainder of Howard&#x27;s term. She was re-elected to the position in August 2017 and August 2019 by full membership vote.

==Early years==
Carteris was born in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Marlene, a realtor, and Ernest J. Carteris, a restaurant owner. She has a twin brother, James. Her father was of Greek ancestry whereas her mother is Jewish. Her parents separated six months after her birth. Carteris&#x27;s mother moved with her children to San Francisco, California, where she set up a children&#x27;s clothing store. While attending Redwood High School in Larkspur, California, she took an interest in the arts, studying ballet and performing as a mime on a European tour at 16 years old. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1983 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in liberal arts.

==Career==
After graduating from Sarah Lawrence College, Carteris&#x27;s early television career found her typically cast as a teenager in such fare as &quot;ABC Afterschool Specials, CBS Schoolbreak Special,&quot; and the long-running soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. This trend of playing significantly younger would continue when, in 1990, Carteris was cast in her best known role as studious school newspaper editor Andrea Zuckerman on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. At age 29, she was the oldest cast member to portray a 15-year-old, lying about her age to get the part. By 1993, while working for the show, her GABCO Productions company signed a deal with Rysher TPE.

Carteris left the series in 1995 and became the host of her own television talk show, entitled &quot;Gabrielle&quot;, which lasted only one season. She worked regularly as an actor and voiceover artist, amassing a considerable amount of post &quot;90210&quot; credits in television, film, and video games. She has gone on to become a mainstay in television films, starring in nearly a dozen such films. Her first, &quot;Seduced and Betrayed&quot;, was released in 1995. She later became a regular presence on network television, appearing in episodes of such television series as &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, and &quot;NCIS&quot;, among others. She has appeared in several feature films. Carteris provided the voice for the Motorola intelligent assistant &quot;Mya&quot;.

In 2019, Carteris appeared on Fox&#x27;s &quot;BH90210&quot; reboot, appearing both as Andrea Zuckerman and herself. The fictionalized version of herself was portrayed as sexually questioning and engaged in a brief relationship with former &quot;90210&quot; guest-star turned fictional Fox executive Christine Elise.

==SAG-AFTRA==
Carteris became the executive vice president of SAG-AFTRA, following the Screen Actors&#x27; Guild (SAG) and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) merger, in 2012. She became acting president of the union following the death of president Ken Howard on March 23, 2016, and was elected president on April 9, 2016, by the national board of the union to complete Howard&#x27;s remainder of his two-year term. In 2020, she was on a third, two-year term as the president after defeating challengers such as Esai Morales in 2017 and Matthew Modine in 2019 both by direct votes of union membership. She also serves as vice president of the California Labor Federation. In August 2020, she announced that there would be sharp cuts, including a raise in the earnings floor to qualify for next year&#x27;s SAG-AFTRA Health Plan due to two consecutive years of deficits and projected losses in years to come. Carteris did not seek re-election in 2021, backing Fran Drescher as her successor instead.

==Personal life==
While filming the pilot of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210,&quot; Carteris began dating Charles Isaacs, a stockbroker. In 1991, Isaacs moved to Los Angeles to be with her. After two years together, they got married on May 3, 1992, at Santa Barbara&#x27;s Four Seasons resort. Carteris and Isaacs have two daughters.

<doc id="225489" wikidata="Q259461" url="?curid=225489" title="Valerie Perrine">
<text>Valerie Ritchie Perrine (born September 3, 1943) is a retired American actress. For her role as Honey Bruce in the 1974 film &quot;Lenny&quot;, she won the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles, the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her other film appearances include &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot; (1979), and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980).

==Early life==
Perrine was born in Galveston, Texas, as the daughter of Winifred &quot;Renee&quot; (nee McGinley), a dancer who appeared in &quot;Earl Carroll&#x27;s Vanities&quot;, and Kenneth I. Perrine, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army. Kenneth I. Perrine was the grandson of Alfred Perrine of Wallkill, N.Y., a descendant of Staten Island Huguenot Daniel Perrin. The Perrine family dates its ancestry to the French family of Perrin, which intermarried with other Normans dating back to William the Conqueror in 1066. Her mother was Scottish (of Irish descent), from Helensburgh in Dunbartonshire.

Owing to her father&#x27;s military career, Perrine lived in many locations as the family moved to different posts.

==Career==
In 1968, Perrine was a showgirl in &quot;Lido de Paris&quot; at Stardust Resort and Casino Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=&quot;lasvegassun/15/4271&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She played soft-core pornography actress Montana Wildhack in the film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1972). Perrine was photographed nude for a pictorial layout in the May 1972 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, later appearing on the cover in August 1981. She then became the first actress to appear nude on American network television by intentionally exposing her breasts during the May 4, 1973, PBS broadcast of Bruce Jay Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Steambath&quot; on &quot;Hollywood Television Theater.&quot; Only a few PBS stations nationwide carried the program. Later in 1973, she appeared in the episode &quot;When the Girls Came Out to Play&quot; of the romantic anthology television series &quot;Love Story&quot; (1973).

In 1975, Perrine was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actress (Drama) and won the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival for her role as comedian Lenny Bruce&#x27;s wife, stripper Honey Bruce, in Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;Lenny&quot; (1974).

She portrayed Carlotta Monti, mistress of W.C. Fields, in the biopic &quot;W.C. Fields and Me&quot; (1976). She played Miss Eve Teschmacher, moll of criminal mastermind Lex Luthor, in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). For this role, she was nominated for the 1979 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She reprised her role as Miss Teschmacher in &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980).

Perrine played Charlotta Steele, ex-wife of a rodeo champion played Robert Redford, in &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot; (1979). Her career grew uneven after an appearance in &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; (1980), for which she was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actress. This film has since become a cult classic. In 1982, she played the role of Marcy, the wife of a corrupt police officer, in &quot;The Border&quot; with Jack Nicholson. In 1986, she starred in the failed CBS comedy series &quot;Leo &amp; Liz in Beverly Hills&quot; with Harvey Korman.

In the years since then, Perrine has worked in lower-profile projects, although she did have a small supporting role in the 2000 Mel Gibson film &quot;What Women Want&quot;. In 1995, Perrine made a guest appearance on the series &quot;&quot;, playing an ex-wife of Richard Belzer&#x27;s character, Detective John Munch.

Stacey Souther directed and produced &quot;Valerie&quot;, a 45 minute documentary about Perrine&#x27;s career and her experience with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. &quot;Valerie&quot; was screened at the Edmonton Film Festival in 2020.

==Personal life==
In 1969, Perrine began dating Hollywood hair stylist Jay Sebring. He invited her to a dinner party in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. She found someone to work for her that night, but at the last minute that person got sick, and Perrine had to show up for work. It turned out that the party she missed was the night when the Manson Family murdered six people at Sharon Tate&#x27;s home, including Sebring.

As of April 2023, Perrine lives in Beverly Hills, California. 

===Health===
Perrine was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2015 and underwent dental surgery in 2017 to restore her teeth after they became damaged due to the medications she had been taking for her illness.

<text>The 38th Canadian Parliament was in session from October 4, 2004, until November 29, 2005. The membership was set by the 2004 federal election on June 28, 2004, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections, but due to the seat distribution, those few changes significantly affected the distribution of power. It was dissolved prior to the 2006 election.

It was controlled by a Liberal Party minority under Prime Minister Paul Martin and the 27th Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the Conservative Party, led by Stephen Harper.

The Speaker was Peter Milliken. See also List of Canadian federal electoral districts for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

There was one session of the 38th Parliament:
The parliament was dissolved following a vote of non-confidence passed on 28 November by the opposition Conservatives, supported by the New Democratic Party and Bloc Québécois. Consequently, a federal election was held on 23 January 2006 to choose the next parliament.

==Party standings==
The party standings as of the election and as of dissolution were as follows:
==Bills of the 38th Parliament==
Important bills of the 38th parliament included:
*Bill C-32 – the Department of Foreign Affairs Act to split DFAIT in two departments, was a surprise defeat for the government
*Bill C-38 – the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, legalized Same-sex marriage across Canada.

<doc id="225494" wikidata="Q229258" url="?curid=225494" title="Gena Rowlands">
<text>Virginia Cathryn &quot;Gena&quot; Rowlands (; June 19, 1930 – August 14, 2024) was an American actress, whose career in film, stage, and television spanned nearly seven decades. She was a four-time Emmy Award and two-time Golden Globe winner, was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

She rose to prominence for her collaborations with her actor-director husband John Cassavetes in ten films, including &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; (1974) and &quot;Gloria&quot; (1980), both of which earned her Oscar nominations. She also won the Silver Bear for Best Actress for &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1977). Her other notable roles included William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot; (1978), Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Another Woman&quot; (1988), Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Night on Earth&quot; (1991), Mira Nair&#x27;s &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot; (2002), her son Nick Cassavetes&#x27;s &quot;The Notebook&quot; (2004).

In 2021, Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said, &quot;The most important and original movie actor of the past half century-plus is Gena Rowlands.&quot; In November 2015, Rowlands received an Honorary Academy Award in recognition of her unique screen performances.

== Early years ==
Rowlands was born on June 19, 1930, in Madison, Wisconsin. Her mother, Mary Allen (&quot;née&quot; Neal), was a housewife who later worked as an actress under the stage name Lady Rowlands. Her father, Edwin Myrwyn Rowlands, was a banker and state legislator. He was a member of the Wisconsin Progressive Party, and was of Welsh descent. She had an elder brother, David Rowlands. 

Her family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1939, when Edwin was appointed to a position in the United States Department of Agriculture; moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1942, when he was appointed branch manager of the Office of Price Administration; and later moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. From 1947 to 1950, she attended the University of Wisconsin, where she was a popular student already renowned for her beauty. While in college, she was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. She left for New York City to study drama at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

== Career ==

=== Early roles (1952–1967) ===
In the early 1950s, Rowlands performed with repertory theatre companies and at the Provincetown Playhouse. She made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; and toured in a national production of the play. In 1956, she starred in the Broadway play &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; opposite Edward G. Robinson.

Rowlands costarred with Paul Stewart in the 26-episode syndicated TV series &quot;Top Secret&quot; (1954–55). She guest-starred on such anthology television series as &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, and &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, all in 1955. In 1959, Rowlands appeared in the Western series &quot;Laramie&quot;, alongside her husband John Cassavetes in the detective series &quot;Johnny Staccato&quot;, and in the Western series &quot;Riverboat&quot;, starring Darren McGavin. In 1961, she appeared in the adventure series &quot;The Islanders&quot;, set in the South Pacific, and in &quot;&quot;, starring Stephen McNally. She guest-starred in &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot;, the detective series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, the Westerns &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;The Virginian&quot;, and &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, all in 1963. In 1964, she guest-starred in the medical drama &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; and in two episodes of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;. She appeared in four episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, three of which were after the series had been renamed &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;. In 1967, she was cast as socialite Adrienne Van Leyden in the prime-time ABC soap opera &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.

Rowlands made her film debut in &quot;The High Cost of Loving&quot; in 1958. In 1962, she starred in director David Miller&#x27;s &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot;, with Kirk Douglas and Walter Matthau. She played the former lover of the Kirk Douglas character, now the wife of the Douglas character&#x27;s best friend.

=== Cassavetes era (1963–1984) ===

Rowlands and Cassavetes made ten films together: &quot;A Child Is Waiting&quot; (1963), &quot;Faces&quot; (1968), &quot;Machine Gun McCain&quot; (1969), &quot;Minnie and Moskowitz&quot; (1971), &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; (1974; nomination for Academy Award for Best Actress), &quot;Two-Minute Warning&quot; (1976), &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1977), &quot;Gloria&quot; (1980; nomination for Academy Award for Best Actress), &quot;Tempest&quot; (1982), and &quot;Love Streams&quot; (1984).

According to Boston University film scholar Ray Carney, Rowlands sought to suppress an early version of Cassavetes&#x27;s first film, &quot;Shadows&quot;, that Carney says he rediscovered after decades of searching. Rowlands also became involved in the screenings of &quot;Husbands&quot; and &quot;Love Streams&quot;, according to Carney. The UCLA Film and Television Archive mounted a restoration of &quot;Husbands&quot;, as it was pruned down (without Cassavetes&#x27;s consent, and in violation of his contract) by Columbia Pictures several months after its release, in an attempt to restore as much of the removed content as possible. At Rowlands&#x27;s request, UCLA created an alternative print with almost ten minutes of content edited out, as Rowlands felt that these scenes were in poor taste. The alternative print is the only one that has been made available for rental.

=== Late career (1985–2014) ===
In 1985, Rowlands played the mother in the critically acclaimed made-for-TV movie &quot;An Early Frost&quot;. She won an Emmy for her portrayal of former First Lady of the United States Betty Ford in the 1987 made-for-TV movie &quot;The Betty Ford Story&quot;.

In 1988, Rowlands starred in Woody Allen&#x27;s dramatic film &quot;Another Woman&quot;. She played Marion Post, a middle-aged professor who is prompted to a journey of self-discovery when she overhears the therapy sessions of another woman (Mia Farrow). The review in &quot;Time Out&quot; described the character&#x27;s trajectory: &quot;Marion gets to thinking, and is appalled to realise that so many assumptions about her own life and marriage are largely unfounded: in her desire for a controlled existence, she has evaded the emotional truth about relationships with her best friend (Sandy Dennis), brother (Harris Yulin) and husband (Ian Holm).&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; praised the &quot;marvellous&quot; performances in the film, adding, &quot;Rowlands&#x27; perfectly pitched approach to a demanding role is particularly stunning.&quot; Film4 called her performance &quot;sublime&quot;, while Roger Ebert noted that it marked a considerable change in tone from her work with Cassavetes, thus showing &quot;how good an actress Rowlands has been all along.&quot;

In 1995, Rowlands appeared as Julia Roberts&#x27;s mother in the comedy-drama film &quot;Something to Talk About&quot;, and in 1998, she played Sandra Bullock&#x27;s mother in the dramatic film &quot;Hope Floats&quot;. In 2002, Rowlands appeared in Mira Nair&#x27;s HBO movie &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot;, for which she won her third Emmy. 

In 2004, she starred as the older version of Rachel McAdams&#x27;s character in the romantic drama film &quot;The Notebook&quot; alongside James Garner as her husband, which was directed by her son Nick Cassavetes. The same year, she won her first Daytime Emmy for her role as Mrs. Evelyn Ritchie in the made-for-TV movie &quot;The Incredible Mrs. Ritchie&quot;. 

In 2005, she appeared opposite Kate Hudson, Peter Sarsgaard, and John Hurt in the gothic thriller &quot;The Skeleton Key&quot;. The next year she appeared as Mrs. Hellman in an episode from the third season of &quot;Numb3rs&quot;. She played a Nazi survivor whose whole family was killed. The family owned a painting that the Nazis confiscated. Later on the painting reappeared. The new owner lent the painting to an art gallery in Los Angeles but while on display it was stolen. FBI agent Don Eppes, played by Rob Morrow, tries to figure out what really happened. Rowlands received positive reviews for this role. She has been a spokesperson for people who were persecuted by the Nazis.

In 2007, she played a supporting role opposite Parker Posey and Melvil Poupaud in &quot;Broken English&quot;, an independent American feature written and directed by her daughter Zoe Cassavetes. In 2009, she appeared on an episode of &quot;Monk&quot; (&quot;Mr. Monk and the Lady Next Door&quot;). On March 2, 2010, she appeared on an episode of &quot;NCIS&quot; as lead character Leroy Jethro Gibbs&#x27;s former mother-in-law, who is embroiled in a murder investigation. In 2014, she starred in the film adaptation of &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks&quot;. In 2015, she described herself as generally retired from acting.

== Personal life ==
Rowlands was married to John Cassavetes from March 9, 1954, until his death on February 3, 1989. They met at the American Academy at Carnegie Hall, where they were both students. They had three children, all actor-directors: Nick, Alexandra, and Zoe.

Rowlands married retired businessman Robert Forrest in 2012.

Rowlands stated that she was a fan of actress Bette Davis while growing up. She played Davis&#x27;s daughter in the 1979 made-for-TV film &quot;&quot;. 

===Illness and death===
On June 24, 2024, Nick Cassavetes announced that his mother had been living with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for the previous five years. Rowlands died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at her home in Indian Wells, California, on August 14, 2024, at the age of 94.

<text>Mino da Fiesole (c. 1429 – July 11, 1484), also known as Mino di Giovanni, was an Italian Renaissance sculptor from Poppi, Tuscany. He is noted for his portrait busts.

==Career==
Mino&#x27;s work was influenced by his master Desiderio da Settignano and by Antonio Rossellino, and is characterized by its sharp, angular treatment of drapery. Unlike most Florentine sculptors of his generation, Mino passed two lengthy sojourns in Rome, from about 1459 to 1464 and again from about 1473/1474 until 1480.

Mino was a friend and fellow-worker of Desiderio da Settignano and Matteo Civitali, all three being about the same age. Mino&#x27;s sculpture is remarkable for its finish and delicacy of details, as well as for its spirituality and strong devotional feeling.

Of Mino&#x27;s earlier works, the finest are in the cathedral of Fiesole, the altarpiece and tomb of Bishop Leonardo Salutati (died 1466)

His most arduous and complicated commissions, which define his intellectual and artistic nature, are an altarpiece and tombs for the church of the Benedictine monastery in Florence known as the Badia. (The monuments have been reinstalled in the rebuilt church.) The first, completed about 1468, was essentially a private commission for the Florentine jurist Bernardo Giugni. 
The second, directly commissioned by the monks and finished in 1481, honored the memory of their founder, the tenth century Ugo, count of Tuscany. 
The wall monuments exercised Mino&#x27;s skills: portraits and bas-reliefs are worked into complex tectonic aedicular structures with elaborate highly individualistic decorative moldings. 
Art historians have revelled in the extraordinary diversity of contemporary and ancient sources that Mino marshaled in these tombs, which distinguish him from other sculptors active in mid quattrocento Florence (Zuraw 1998).
The pulpit in Prato Cathedral, in which he collaborated with Antonio Rossellino, finished in 1473, is very delicately sculpted with bas-reliefs of great minuteness, but somewhat weakly designed.

In 1473 he went to Rome where he remained apparently about six years. It is doubtful if all the monuments there attributed to him are of his own hands; there is no question about the tomb of the Florentine Francesco Tornabuoni in the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the remains of the monument to Pope Paul II in the crypt of St. Peter&#x27;s, and the beautiful little marble tabernacle for the holy oils in St. Maria in Trastevere bears the inscription &quot;Opus Mini&quot;.

Several monuments in Santa Maria del Popolo have at times been attributed to Mino, for example the marble reredos given by Pope Alexander VI. The monuments there of Archbishop of Salerno Pietro Guglielmo Rocca (d. 1482) and Bishop of Burgos Ortega Gomiel (d. 1514), however, have also been attributed to the school of Andrea Bregno.

Some of Mino&#x27;s portrait busts and profile bas-reliefs are preserved in the Bargello at Florence; they are full of life and expression, though without the extreme realism of Verrocchio and other sculptors of his time.

Several museums house Mino&#x27;s work, some of which include Musée du Louvre in Paris, France, Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, Birmingham Museum of Art in Birmingham, Alabama, and National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

His other works include:
*a portrait bust of Piero de Medici (1453), notable as &quot;the oldest authenticated example we have of a post-classical portrait of a living person in the form of a marble bust&quot;.
*a portrait bust of Niccolò Strozzi (1454)
*a bust of Astorgio Manfredi (1455)
*the ciborium over the high altar of Santa Maria Maggiore, in Rome
*a bust of Diotisalvi Neroni, adviser to Piero de Medici (1464)
*companion pieces of &quot;Charity&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;, most probably designed for a wall tomb (1475/1480)

Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot; of Mino da Fiesole in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot; dismisses him as a mere follower of Desiderio da Settignano, his master.

<text>Estelle Louise Fletcher (July 22, 1934 – September 23, 2022) was an American actress. She is best known for her portrayal of the antagonist Nurse Ratched in the film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975), which earned her numerous accolades, including the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. 

Fletcher had a recurring role as the Bajoran religious leader Kai Winn Adami in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993–1999). She was nominated for two Emmy Awards for her roles in the television series &quot;Picket Fences&quot; (1996) and &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; (2004). Her final role was as Rosie in the Netflix series &quot;Girlboss&quot; (2017).

==Early life==
Estelle Louise Fletcher was born on July 22, 1934, in Birmingham, Alabama, the second of four children of Estelle (&quot;&quot; Caldwell) and the Reverend Robert Capers Fletcher, an Episcopal missionary from Arab, Alabama. Her parents were deaf and worked with the deaf/hard-of-hearing, but Fletcher and her siblings, Roberta, John, and Georgianna, were all hearing normally, so the children were sent in turns to live with Estelle&#x27;s hearing sister in Texas for three months at a time to ensure they learned spoken English. Fletcher&#x27;s father founded more than 40 churches for the deaf in Alabama. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in drama from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1957.

==Career==

Fletcher began appearing in several television series including &quot;Lawman&quot; (1958) and &quot;Maverick&quot; (1959). (The &quot;Maverick&quot; episode &quot;The Saga of Waco Williams&quot; with James Garner was the series&#x27;s highest-rated episode.) Also in 1959, she appeared in an episode of the original &quot;Untouchables&quot; TV series starring Robert Stack, &quot;Ma Barker and Her Boys&quot;, as Elouise. Fletcher recalled having greater success being cast in Westerns due to her height:

In 1960, Fletcher made two guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, as defendant Gladys Doyle in &quot;The Case of the Mythical Monkeys&quot;, and as Susan Connolly in &quot;The Case of the Larcenous Lady&quot;. In the summer of 1960, she was cast as Roberta McConnell in the episode &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot; of &quot;Tate&quot;, starring David McLean.

In 1974, Fletcher returned to film in the crime drama &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;, co-produced by her husband Jerry Bick and Robert Altman, who also directed. When the two had a falling out on Altman&#x27;s next project (&quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), Altman decided to cast Lily Tomlin for the role of Linnea Reese, initially created for and by Fletcher. Meanwhile, director Miloš Forman saw Fletcher in &quot;Thieves&quot; and cast her as McMurphy&#x27;s nemesis Nurse Ratched in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975). She based her performance of the character on the paternalistic way she saw white people treat black people in her native Alabama. Fletcher gained international recognition and fame for the role, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as a BAFTA Award and Golden Globe. She was only the third actress ever to win an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award for a single performance, after Audrey Hepburn and Liza Minnelli. When Fletcher accepted her Oscar, she used sign language to thank her parents.

After &quot;Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, Fletcher had mixed success in film. She made several financially and critically successful films, while others were box-office failures. Fletcher&#x27;s film roles were in such features as &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977), &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; (1979), &quot;The Magician of Lublin&quot; (1979), &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1983), &quot;Firestarter&quot; (1984), &quot;Invaders From Mars&quot; (1986), &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; (1987), &quot;Two Moon Junction&quot; (1988), &quot;Best of the Best&quot; (1989), &quot;Blue Steel&quot; (1990), &quot;Virtuosity&quot; (1995), &quot;High School High&quot; (1996), and &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; (1999), as the aunt of Ryan Phillippe&#x27;s Sebastian. Additionally, she played the character Ruth Shorter, a supporting role, in &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot; (2005), alongside Joshua Jackson and Donald Sutherland, and appeared in the Fox Faith film &quot;The Last Sin Eater&quot; (2007).

Fletcher co-starred in TV movies such as &quot;The Karen Carpenter Story&quot; (1989) (as Karen and Richard Carpenter&#x27;s mother, Agnes), &quot;Nightmare on the 13th Floor&quot; (1990), &quot;The Haunting of Seacliff Inn&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Stepford Husbands&quot; (1996). From 1993 to 1999, she held a recurring role in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; as the scheming Bajoran religious leader Kai Winn Adami. She also earned Emmy Award nominations for her guest roles on &quot;Picket Fences&quot; (1996), and later on &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; (2004). In 2009, Fletcher appeared in &quot;Heroes&quot; as the physician mother of character Emma Coolidge. In 2011 and 2012, she appeared on four episodes of &quot;Shameless&quot; as Grammy Gallagher, Frank Gallagher&#x27;s foul-mouthed and hard-living mother, who is serving a prison sentence for manslaughter related to a meth lab explosion. She portrayed the recurring role of Rosie on the series &quot;Girlboss&quot; (2017).

==Personal life==

Fletcher married producer Jerry Bick, divorcing in 1977. The couple had two sons, John Dashiell Bick and Andrew Wilson Bick. Fletcher took an 11-year break from acting to raise them.

Fletcher received an honorary degree from Gallaudet University in 1982.

Fletcher died at her home in Montdurausse, France, on September 23, 2022, at the age of 88.

<text>Lido Anthony &quot;Lee&quot; Iacocca ( ; October 15, 1924 – July 2, 2019) was an American automobile executive who developed the Ford Mustang, Continental Mark III, and Ford Pinto cars while at the Ford Motor Company in the 1960s, and then revived the Chrysler Corporation as its CEO during the 1980s. He was president of Chrysler from 1978 to 1991 and chairman and CEO from 1979 until his retirement at the end of 1992. He was one of the few executives to preside over the operations of two of the United States&#x27; Big Three automakers.

Iacocca authored or co-authored several books, including &quot;&quot; (with William Novak), and &quot;Where Have All the Leaders Gone?.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Iacocca was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on October 15, 1924, to Nicola Iacocca and Antonietta Perrotta, Italian Americans from San Marco dei Cavoti, who settled in the steel producing region of the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania. Members of his family opened a restaurant, Yocco&#x27;s Hot Dogs, which has since grown to include five popular store locations in Allentown and its suburbs. Iacocca was reportedly christened with the unusual name &quot;Lido&quot; because he was conceived during his parents&#x27; honeymoon in the Lido district in Venice. However, he denied the basis for his christened name in his autobiography, calling it romantic but untrue; his father, Iacocca wrote, travelled to Lido long before his marriage with the brother of his future wife.

Iacocca attended Allentown High School in Allentown, where he graduated with honors in 1942. He then attended Lehigh University in neighboring Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a degree in industrial engineering. At Lehigh University, he was a member of Tau Beta Pi, the engineering honor society, and Theta Chi fraternity.

After graduating from Lehigh, he won the Wallace Memorial Fellowship and attended Princeton University, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering in 1946.

==Career==
===Ford Motor Company (1946 to 1978)===
Iacocca joined Ford Motor Company in August 1946 as an engineer. After this brief stint in engineering, he asked to be moved to sales and marketing, where his career flourished. While working in the Philadelphia district as assistant sales manager, Iacocca gained national recognition with his &quot;56 for &#x27;56&quot; campaign, offering loans on 1956 model year cars with a 20% down payment and $56 (~$ in ) in monthly payments for three years. His campaign went national, and Iacocca was called to the Dearborn headquarters, where he quickly moved up through the ranks. On November 10, 1960, Iacocca was named vice-president and general manager of the Ford Division; in January 1965 Ford&#x27;s vice-president, car and truck group; in 1967, executive vice-president; and president on December 10, 1970.

Iacocca participated in the design of several successful Ford automobiles, most notably the Ford Mustang, the Continental Mark III, the Ford Escort and the revival of the Mercury brand in the late 1960s, including the introduction of the Mercury Cougar and Mercury Marquis. He promoted other ideas that did not reach the marketplace as Ford products, including cars ultimately introduced by Chrysler: the K car and the minivan. Iacocca also convinced company boss Henry Ford II to return to racing, claiming several wins at the Indianapolis 500, NASCAR, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Eventually, he became the president of the Ford Motor Company, but he clashed with Henry Ford II. On July 13, 1978, Iacocca was fired from Ford, even though the company posted a $2 billion profit for the year.

====Ford Pinto====

In 1968, Iacocca foresaw the need for domestically produced, small, fuel-efficient vehicles, and proposed a vehicle that weighed less than 2,000 pounds and would be priced at less than $2,000 (~$ in ). Although Ford&#x27;s European subsidiary was already selling such a model, the Ford Escort, a team of Ford designers was assigned to create the exterior and interior of an entirely new car, which would be named Pinto. The Pinto entered production beginning with the 1971 model year. Iacocca was described as the &quot;moving force&quot; behind the Ford Pinto.

In 1977, there were allegations that the Pinto&#x27;s structural design allowed its fuel-tank filler neck to break off and the fuel tank to be punctured in a rear-end collision, resulting in deadly fires. In 1978, all 1971–76 Pintos were recalled and had safety shielding and reinforcements installed to protect the fuel tank.

===Chrysler (1978 to 1992)===

Iacocca was strongly courted by Chrysler at a time when the company appeared to be on the verge of going out of business and had just sold its loss-making Chrysler Europe division to Peugeot in an effort to generate cash because the company was losing millions already in North America. This was partially due to recalls of its Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare, both of which, Iacocca later said, were among the causes for Chrysler&#x27;s woes and customer dissatisfaction. Iacocca joined Chrysler and began rebuilding the entire company from the ground up and bringing in many former associates from Ford.

Also from Ford, Iacocca brought to Chrysler the &quot;Mini-Max&quot; project, which, in 1983, bore fruit in the highly successful Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager. Henry Ford II had wanted nothing to do with the Mini-Max, a restyled version of the minivan, which Toyota was selling in huge numbers in Asia and Latin America, and his opinion doomed the project at Ford. Hal Sperlich, the driving force behind the Mini-Max at Ford, had been fired a few months before Iacocca. He had been hired by Chrysler, where the two would make automotive history together.

Iacocca arrived shortly after Chrysler&#x27;s introduction of the subcompact Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon. Bearing a strong resemblance to the Volkswagen Rabbit, the front-wheel-drive Omni and Horizon became instant hits, selling over 300,000 units each in their debut year, showing what was to come for Chrysler. The Omni was a derivative of Chrysler Europe&#x27;s Chrysler Horizon, one of the first deliberately designed &quot;World Cars&quot;, which resulted in the American and European cars looking nearly identical externally. However, underneath remarkably similar-looking sheetmetal, engines, transmissions, suspensions, bumpers, and interior design were quite different. Initially the U.S. cars even used VW-based engines (while the European models used Simca engines), as American Chrysler did not have an engine of an appropriate size for the Omni until the 2.2L engine from the Chrysler K-Car became available. Ironically, some later year base model U.S. Omnis used a French Peugeot-based 1.6L engine.

====1979 Chrysler bailout====


Realizing that the company would go out of business if it did not receive a large infusion of cash, Chrysler approached the United States Congress in 1979 and requested a loan guarantee. Chairman and CEO John J. Riccardo resigned on September 17, 1979, because he believed that the company would be more likely to receive government aid under new management. His retirement took effect three days later and he was succeeded by Iacocca. Iacocca was able to obtain the guarantee, but Chrysler was required to reduce costs and abandon some longstanding projects, such as the turbine engine, which had been ready for consumer production in 1979 after nearly 20 years of development.

Chrysler released the first of the K-Car line, the Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant, in 1981. Similar to the later minivan, these compact automobiles were based on design proposals that Ford had rejected during Iacocca&#x27;s (and Sperlich&#x27;s) tenure. Released in the middle of the major 1980–1982 recession, the small, efficient, and inexpensive front-wheel drive cars sold rapidly. In addition, Iacocca re-introduced the big Imperial as the company&#x27;s flagship. The new model had all of the newest technologies of the time, including fully electronic fuel injection and all-digital dashboard.

Chrysler introduced the minivan, considered Sperlich&#x27;s &quot;baby&quot;, in late 1983. It led the automobile industry in sales for 25 years. Because of the K-cars and minivans, along with the reforms Iacocca implemented, the company turned around quickly and was able to repay the government-backed loans seven years earlier than expected.

Iacocca led Chrysler&#x27;s acquisition of AMC in 1987, which brought the profitable Jeep division under the corporate umbrella. It created the short-lived Eagle division. By this time, AMC had already finished most of the work on the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which Iacocca wanted. The Grand Cherokee would not be released until 1992 for the 1993 model year, the same year that Iacocca retired.

Throughout the 1980s, Iacocca, with the help of his longtime friend and advertisement executive, Leo-Arthur Kelmenson, appeared in a series of commercials developed by Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt for the company&#x27;s vehicles, employing the ad campaign, &quot;The pride is back,&quot; to denote the turnaround of the corporation. He also voiced what was to become his trademark phrase: &quot;If you can find a better car, buy it.&quot;

Iacocca retired as president, CEO, and chairman of Chrysler at the end of 1992.

===1995 return to Chrysler===

In 1995, Iacocca helped billionaire Kirk Kerkorian attempt a hostile takeover of Chrysler, which was ultimately unsuccessful. The next year, Kerkorian and Chrysler made a five-year agreement which included a gag order preventing Iacocca from speaking publicly about Chrysler.

In July 2005, Iacocca returned to the airwaves as Chrysler&#x27;s pitchman, along with celebrities such as Jason Alexander and Snoop Dogg, to promote Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;Employee Pricing Plus&quot; program; the ads reprise the &quot;If you can find a better car, buy it&quot; line, Iacocca&#x27;s trademark of the 1980s. In return for his services, Iacocca and DaimlerChrysler agreed that his fees, plus a $1 donation per vehicle sold from July 1 through December 31, 2005, would be given to the Iacocca Foundation for type 1 diabetes research.

===Chrysler bankruptcy===

In an April 2009 &quot;Newsweek&quot; interview, Iacocca reflected on his time spent at Chrysler and the company&#x27;s current situation. He said:

Because of the Chrysler bankruptcy, Iacocca lost part of his pension from a supplemental executive retirement plan, and a guaranteed company car during his lifetime. The losses occurred after the bankruptcy court approved the sale of Chrysler to Chrysler Group LLC, with ownership of the new company by the United Auto Workers, the Italian carmaker Fiat and the governments of the United States and Canada.

==Other work and activities==
===Books===
In 1984, Iacocca co-wrote an autobiography with William Novak: &quot;.&quot; It was the best selling non-fiction hardback book of 1984 and 1985. The book used heavy discounting, which would become a trend among publishers in the 1980s. Iacocca donated the proceeds of the book&#x27;s sales to type 1 diabetes research.

In 1988, with Sonny Kleinfeld, Iacocca co-authored &quot;Talking Straight&quot;, a book meant as a counterbalance to Akio Morita&#x27;s &quot;Made in Japan,&quot; a non-fiction book praising Japan&#x27;s post-war hard-working culture. &quot;Talking Straight&quot; praised the innovation and creativity of Americans.

On April 17, 2007, Simon &amp; Schuster published Iacocca&#x27;s book, &quot;Where Have All the Leaders Gone?&quot;, co-written with Catherine Whitney.

===Businesses===
Iacocca partnered with producer Pierre Cossette to bring a production of &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot; to Branson, Missouri, in 1994. He also invested in Branson Hills, a 1,400-acre housing development.

In 1993, he had joined the board of MGM Grand, led by his friend Kirk Kerkorian. He started a merchant bank to fund ventures in the gaming industry, which he called &quot;the fastest-growing business in the world&quot;. In 1995, he sold his interests in several Indian gaming projects to Full House Resorts, a casino operator led by his friend Allen Paulson, becoming a major shareholder and later a member of the board of directors.

Iacocca founded Olivio Premium Products in 1993. Olivio&#x27;s signature product was an olive oil-based margarine product. Iacocca appeared in commercials for Olivio.

Iacocca joined the board of restaurant chain Koo Koo Roo in 1995. In 1998, he stepped up to serve as acting chairman of the troubled company, and led it through a merger with Family Restaurants (owner of Chi-Chi&#x27;s and El Torito). He sat on the board of the merged company until stepping down in 1999.

In 1997, Iacocca founded Iacocca, a company formed to develop and market electric bikes with a top speed of 15 mph and a range of 20 miles between recharging at wall outlets. They produced E-Bike SX, which became the first widely popular electric bicycle in the US. In 1999, Iacocca became the head of EV Global Motors.

===Activism and philanthropy===
In May 1982, President Ronald Reagan appointed Iacocca to head the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, which was created to raise funds for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty and the renovation of Ellis Island. Iacocca continued to serve on the board of the foundation until his death.

Following the death of Iacocca&#x27;s wife Mary from type 1 diabetes, he became an active supporter of research for the disease. He was one of the main patrons of the research of Denise Faustman at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 2000, Iacocca founded Olivio Premium Products, which manufactures the Olivio line of food products made from olive oil. He donated all profits from the company to type 1 diabetes research. In 2004, Iacocca launched Join Lee Now, a national grassroots campaign, to bring Faustman&#x27;s research to human clinical trials in 2006.

Iacocca was an advocate of &quot;Nourish the Children&quot;, an initiative of Nu Skin Enterprises, since its inception in 2002, and served as its chairman. He helped donate a generator for the Malawi VitaMeal plant.

Iacocca led the fundraising campaign to enable Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to adapt and use vacant buildings formerly owned by Bethlehem Steel, including Iacocca Hall on the Mountaintop Campus at the university. These structures currently house the College of Education, the biology and chemical engineering departments, and The Iacocca Institute, which is focused on global competitiveness.

===Acting===
Iacocca played Park Commissioner Lido in &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;, the 44th episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, which premiered on May 9, 1986. The name of the character is his birth name, which was not used in the public sphere due to the trouble of mispronunciation or misspelling.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and family===
Iacocca married Mary McCleary on September 29, 1956. They had two daughters. Iacocca&#x27;s wife died from type 1 diabetes on May 15, 1983. Before her death, Iacocca became a strong advocate for better medical treatment of type 1 diabetes patients, who frequently faced debilitating and fatal complications, and he continued this work after her death.

Iacocca&#x27;s second marriage was to Peggy Johnson. They married on April 17, 1986, but in 1987, after nineteen months, Iacocca had the marriage annulled. He married for the third time in 1991 to Darrien Earle. They were divorced three years later.

Iacocca resided in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles in his later years.

==Death==
On July 2, 2019, Iacocca died at his home in Bel Air, at the age of 94, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. 

His funeral mass was held on July 10, 2019, at St. Hugo of the Hills Catholic Church and he was buried at White Chapel Memorial Cemetery in Troy, Michigan.

==Politics==

In his 2007 book, &quot;Where Have All the Leaders Gone?&quot;, Iacocca described how he considered running for president in 1988 and was in the planning stages of a campaign with the slogan &quot;I Like I&quot;, before ultimately being talked out of it by his friend Tip O&#x27;Neill.

Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey discussed with Iacocca an appointment to the U.S. Senate in 1991 after the death of Senator John Heinz, but Iacocca declined.

Politically, Iacocca supported the Republican Party candidate George W. Bush in the 2000 U.S. presidential election. In the 2004 U.S. presidential election, he endorsed Bush&#x27;s Democratic Party opponent, John Kerry. In the 2006 Michigan gubernatorial election, Iacocca appeared in televised political ads endorsing Republican candidate Dick DeVos, who lost. Iacocca endorsed New Mexico governor Bill Richardson for President in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. In the 2012 U.S. presidential election, he endorsed Mitt Romney for president.

On December 3, 2007, Iacocca launched a website to encourage open dialogue about the challenges of contemporary society. He introduced topics such as health care costs, and the United States&#x27; lag in developing alternative energy sources and hybrid vehicles. The site also promotes his book &quot;Where Have All the Leaders Gone&quot;. It provides an interactive means for users to rate presidential candidates by the qualities Iacocca believes they should possess: curiosity, creativity, communication, character, courage, conviction, charisma, competence and common sense.

==In popular culture==
The high amount of publicity that Iacocca received during his turnaround of Chrysler made him a celebrity and gave him a lasting impact in popular culture. In addition to his acting role in &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, Iacocca also made appearances on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Late Night With David Letterman&quot; and the 1985 Bob Hope TV special &quot;Bob Hope Buys NBC?&quot; while concurrently it was common to see depictions of elderly, bespectacled businessmen with charismatic, salesman-like personas, such as in an ad campaign by the Rainier Brewing Company. Iacocca&#x27;s success serving as Chrysler&#x27;s pitchman influenced other companies to feature executives in their marketing, such as how fast food chain Wendy&#x27;s has successfully utilized company founder Dave Thomas as a corporate mascot since the early 1990s. Iacocca&#x27;s image was also invoked by rival automaker Ford in the marketing campaign for the 1993 Mercury Villager minivan, which depicted a competing car company led by an unhappy boss with a physical resemblance to Iacocca viewing the Villager with consternation because it is outselling their minivan. Fictional businessmen and middle managers, such as Michael Scott on &quot;The Office&quot;, have been shown reading Iacocca&#x27;s books and attempting to emulate his methods. In a manner similar to Ronald Reagan, period pieces produced in subsequent decades have used images of Iacocca and the Chrysler K-car to invoke the 1980s. The 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, which is set in an alternative history 1985, took this in a unique direction by showing Iacocca (portrayed by Walter Addison) being assassinated by the film&#x27;s antagonists, which has been said to have angered Iacocca when he learned about it.
In Ordinary People, a song from Neil Young released in &quot;Chrome Dreams II&quot; and &quot;Bluenote Café&quot;, Lee Iacocca is quoted in the lyrics as a notable representative of the capitalistic world.

Iacocca, portrayed by Jon Bernthal, is a major character in the 2019 film &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;, which is a dramatization of the 1960s Ford GT40 program. The film was released shortly after Iacocca&#x27;s death.

Tom Paxton wrote a song about the bailouts called &quot;I Am Changing My Name To Chrysler,&quot; which mentions Iacocca prominently in the chorus. It was critical of the bailout for serving corporate interests ahead of supposed good business or capitalist principles.

He was also portrayed by Phil Hartman on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

He is also referenced in The Arrogant Worms&#x27; ode to a Chrysler vehicle, &quot;Horizon.&quot;

==Awards==
In 1985, Iacocca received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

<text>General Hospital was a British daytime soap opera produced by ATV that ran on ITV from 1972 to 1979. General Hospital was an attempt to replicate the success of one of British television&#x27;s first major soap operas, &quot;Emergency Ward 10&quot;. The original theme music was &quot;Girl in the White Dress&quot; by the Derek Scott Orchestra which was used until 1975, when it was replaced by Johnny Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Red Alert&quot; for the 60-minute episodes.

==History==

In 1972, ITV started to broadcast programmes on weekday afternoons, triggering a new wave of productions to fill in the extended schedules. Among the first of these shows, which were aimed at giving advertisers access to housewives, were the long-running rural soap &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; (YTV) and the twice-weekly medical drama &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

Set in a fictional Midlands town, the series followed the romantic and professional lives of its doctors and nurses. While the location and the characters names had been changed, in most other respects &quot;General Hospital&quot; was almost identical to its predecessor, &quot;Emergency Ward 10&quot;, a deliberate attempt to recreate its success.

In 1975, after 270 twice-weekly episodes, &quot;General Hospital&quot; was given a prime time slot on Friday evening. The move saw the episode lengths double from 30 to 60 minutes, with each episode being more self-contained, while on-screen medical procedures, including detailed scenes of surgery, became more prominent.

Amongst the regular cast of the series was actor Tony Adams who played Doctor Neville Bywaters; he also appeared as Adam Chance in &quot;Crossroads&quot;. Among the other familiar faces to appear was Lynda Bellingham, who later was later cast as the mother in a series of commercials for Oxo stock cubes, and later as Helen Herriot in the series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, based on the books by James Herriot. Other regulars included Carmen Munroe, who was also a regular presenter in the &quot;Play School&quot; children&#x27;s programme team; and a young Sally Knyvette, who went on to appear in &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;.

By 1979, the &quot;homely&quot; feel of &quot;General Hospital&quot; was considered to be old-fashioned in the wake of newer, grittier dramas, and it was cancelled. Many episodes are missing from television archives.

<doc id="225501" wikidata="Q280851" url="?curid=225501" title="Piero di Cosimo">
<text>Piero di Cosimo (2 January 1462 – 12 April 1522), also known as Piero di Lorenzo, was an Italian Renaissance painter, who continued to use an essentially Early Renaissance style into the 16th century.

He is most famous for the mythological and allegorical subjects he painted in the late Quattrocento; he is said to have abandoned these to return to religious subjects under the influence of Savonarola, the preacher who exercised a huge sway in Florence in the 1490s, and had a similar effect on Botticelli. The High Renaissance style of the new century had little influence on him, and he retained the straightforward realism of his figures, which combines with an often whimsical treatment of his subjects to create the distinctive mood of his works. 

Vasari has many stories of his eccentricity, and the mythological subjects have an individual and quirky fascination. He trained under Cosimo Rosselli, whose daughter he married, and assisted him in his Sistine Chapel frescos. 

He was also influenced by Early Netherlandish painting, and busy landscapes feature in many works, often forests seen close at hand. Several of his most striking secular works are in the long &quot;landscape&quot; format used for paintings inset into cassone wedding chests or spalliera headboards or panelling. He was apparently famous for designing the temporary decorations for Carnival and other festivities.

==Biography==

The son of a goldsmith, Lorenzo di Piero, Piero was born in Florence and apprenticed under the artist Cosimo Rosseli, from whom he derived his popular name and whom he assisted in the painting of the Sistine Chapel in 1481.

In the first phase of his career, Piero was influenced by the Netherlandish naturalism of Hugo van der Goes, whose &quot;Portinari Triptych&quot; (now at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence) helped to lead the whole of Florentine painting into new channels. From him, most probably, Cosimo acquired the love of landscape and the intimate knowledge of the growth of flowers and of animal life. The manner of Hugo van der Goes is especially apparent in the &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;, at the Berlin Museum.

He journeyed to Rome in 1482 with his master, Rosselli. He proved himself a true child of the Renaissance by depicting subjects of Classical mythology in such pictures as &quot;Venus, Mars, and Cupid&quot;, &quot;The Death of Procris&quot;, the Perseus and Andromeda series, at the Uffizi, and many others. Inspired to the Vitruvius&#x27; account of the evolution of man, Piero&#x27;s mythical compositions show the bizarre presence of hybrid forms of men and animals, or the man learning to use fire and tools. The multitudes of nudes in these works shows the influence of Luca Signorelli on Piero&#x27;s art.

During his lifetime, Piero acquired a reputation for eccentricity—a reputation enhanced and exaggerated by later commentators such as Giorgio Vasari, who included a biography of Piero di Cosimo in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;. Reportedly, he was frightened of thunderstorms, and so pyrophobic that he rarely cooked his food; he lived on a diet of hard-boiled eggs, which he prepared 50 at a time while boiling glue for his artworks. He also resisted any cleaning of his studio, or trimming of the fruit trees of his orchard; he lived, wrote Vasari, &quot;more like a beast than a man&quot;.

If, as Vasari asserts, he spent the last years of his life in gloomy retirement, the change was probably due to preacher Girolamo Savonarola, under whose influence he turned his attention once more to religious art. The death of his master Roselli may also have affected Piero&#x27;s morose elder years. The &quot;Immaculate Conception with Saints&quot;, at the Uffizi, and the &quot;Holy Family&quot;, at Dresden, illustrate the religious fervour to which he was stimulated by Savonarola.

With the exception of the landscape background in Rosselli&#x27;s fresco of the &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot;, in the Sistine Chapel, there is no record of any fresco work from his brush. On the other hand, Piero enjoyed a great reputation as a portrait painter: the most famous of his work is in fact the portrait of a Florentine noblewoman, &quot;Simonetta Vespucci&quot;, mistress of Giuliano de&#x27; Medici. According to Vasari, Piero excelled in designing pageants and triumphal processions for the pleasure-loving youths of Florence, and gives a vivid description of one such procession at the end of the carnival of 1507, which illustrated the triumph of death. Piero di Cosimo exercised considerable influence upon his fellow pupils Albertinelli and Bartolomeo della Porta, and was the master of Andrea del Sarto.

Vasari gave Piero&#x27;s date of death as 1521, and this date is still repeated by many sources, including the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. However, contemporary documents reveal that he died of plague on 12 April 1522. He is featured in George Eliot&#x27;s novel &quot;Romola&quot;.

== Biography ==
Ann-Margret Olsson was born on 28 April 1941, in Valsjöbyn, Krokom Municipality, Jämtland County, Sweden, to Anna Regina () and Carl Gustav Olsson, a native of Örnsköldsvik. She described Valsjöbyn as a small town of &quot;lumberjacks and farmers high up near the Arctic Circle&quot;. Her father had emigrated to the United States, but returned to Sweden in 1937 and married Anna Aronsson. After Ann-Margret&#x27;s birth, Gustav wanted to emigrate again with the family.

After World War II, his wife hesitated and Gustav emigrated alone, but was joined by his wife and daughter in 1946. In 1949, Ann-Margret became a naturalized American citizen.

Ann-Margret took her first dance lessons at the Marjorie Young School of Dance, showing natural ability from the start, easily mimicking all the steps. Her parents were supportive, and her mother made all of her costumes by hand. To support the family, Ann-Margret&#x27;s mother became a funeral parlor receptionist after her husband suffered a severe injury on his job. While a teenager, Ann-Margret appeared on the Morris B. Sachs &quot;Amateur Hour&quot;, &quot;Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club&quot;, and Ted Mack&#x27;s &quot;Amateur Hour&quot;. She continued to star in theater as she attended New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois. (Two fellow movie stars Charlton Heston and Rock Hudson, had graduated from the school many years earlier.)

She was part of a group known as the Suttletones, which went to the Dunes hotel and casino in Las Vegas, which also headlined Tony Bennett and Al Hirt at the time. George Burns heard of her performance, and she auditioned for his annual holiday show, for which she and Burns performed a softshoe routine. &quot;Variety&quot; proclaimed that &quot;George Burns has a gold mine in Ann-Margret... she has a definite style of her own, which can easily guide her to star status&quot;.

Ann-Margret is a stepmother of three children of her husband Roger Smith, an actor, who later became her manager. She and Smith were married for 50years from 8May 1967 until his death on 4June 2017. Before this, she dated Eddie Fisher and was romantically linked to Elvis Presley when they co-starred in the film &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; in 1964.

A keen motorcyclist, Ann-Margret rode a 500 cc Triumph T100C Tiger in &quot;The Swinger&quot; (1966) and used the same model, fitted with a nonstandard electric starter, in her stage show and her TV specials. She was featured in Triumph Motorcycles&#x27; official advertisements in the 1960s. She suffered three broken ribs and a fractured shoulder when she was thrown off a motorcycle in rural Minnesota in 2000.

In a 2012 interview, she stated, &quot;All my life I&#x27;ve had this feeling, deep, deep, deep inside of me...my faith and my feelings...I mean you go outside and you see flowers. You see the trees. You see all your loved ones, you see...and then you think of Who created it all.&quot; She described her relationship with God, and with Jesus Christ as &quot;something which is really important to me. If I thought that I would never see my mother and father again, I couldn&#x27;t make it. I could not go a step further.&quot;

On 14 May 2022, she was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in Humane Letters by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

==Career==
===Music career===

Ann-Margret began recording for RCA Victor in 1961, first recording &quot;Lost Love&quot;. Her debut album &quot;And Here She Is ... Ann-Margret&quot; was recorded in Hollywood, arranged and conducted by Marty Paich. Later albums were produced in Nashville with Chet Atkins on guitar, the Jordanaires (Elvis Presley&#x27;s backup singers), and the Anita Kerr Singers, with liner notes by mentor George Burns. She had a sexy, throaty contralto singing voice, and RCA Victor attempted to capitalize on the &quot;female Elvis&quot; comparison by having her record a version of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; and other songs stylistically similar to Presley&#x27;s. She scored a minor success with &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; (from her second LP), which entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 in August 1961 and stayed six weeks, peaking at number 17; the song was later performed by the Beatles in 1963. In 1962, Ann-Margret was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.

Her only charting album was &quot;Beauty and the Beard&quot; (1964), on which she was accompanied by trumpeter Al Hirt. Other career highlights included appearing on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; in 1961 and singing the &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot; theme at the 34th Academy Awards in 1962. Her contract with RCA Victor ended in 1966. In 1963, &quot;Life Magazine&quot; mentioned that her recordings had sold in excess of half a million units.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she had hits on the dance charts, the most successful being 1979&#x27;s &quot;Love Rush&quot;, which peaked at number eight on the disco/dance charts. In 2001, working with Art Greenhaw, she recorded the album &quot;God Is Love: The Gospel Sessions&quot;. The album went on to earn a Grammy nomination (forty years after her first) and also a Dove Award nomination for gospel album of the year. Her album &quot;Ann-Margret&#x27;s Christmas Carol Collection&quot;, also produced and arranged by Greenhaw, was recorded in 2004. 2011 saw the release of &quot;&quot;God is Love: The Gospel Sessions 2&quot;

In 2023, she went back into the studio to record a full-length album of new recordings for Cleopatra Records. &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; featured 13 covers including &quot;Splish Splash&quot;, &quot;Earth Angel&quot;, &quot;Son of A Preacher Man&quot;, and a new take on &quot;Teach Me Tonight&quot;&quot; featuring Pat Boone. Other guest performers included Pete Townshend, The Fuzztones, Paul Shaffer, The Oak Ridge Boys, and more. The album was released on 14 April 2023, on vinyl, compact disc, and on all streaming platforms.

===Rapid rise to Hollywood stardom (1961–64)===
In 1961, Ann-Margret filmed a screen test at 20th Century Fox and was signed to a seven-year contract. She made her film debut in a loan-out to United Artists in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; with Bette Davis; it is a remake of Capra&#x27;s own &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; (1933). For her performance Ann-Margret was awarded her first Golden Globe, for New Actress of the Year alongside Jane Fonda and Christine Kaufmann.

Then came a 1962 remake of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s musical &quot;State Fair&quot;, in which she played the &quot;bad girl&quot; role of Emily opposite Bobby Darin and Pat Boone. She had previously tested for the part of Margie, the &quot;good girl&quot;, but the studio bosses deemed her too seductive for that role. In her autobiography, Ann-Margret wrote that the two roles seemed to represent the two sides of her real-life personality. She was shy and reserved offstage but wildly exuberant and sensuous onstage, transforming &quot;from Little Miss Lollipop to Sexpot-Banshee&quot;, in her words. In a 2021 retrospective of Ann-Margret&#x27;s career for &quot;FilmInk&quot;, Stephen Vagg argued &quot;she wasn&#x27;t that well cast as a bad girl. Because she had so much energy and shape, producers thought she was; but she was more effective in parts closer to what she was in real life: an energetic good girl with a twinkle in the eye.&quot;

Her performance as the all-American teenager Kim in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (1963) made her a major star. Its premiere at Radio City Music Hall, 16 years after her first visit to the famed theater, was the highest first-week grossing film to date at the Music Hall. &quot;Life&quot; magazine put her on the cover for the second time and announced that the &quot;torrid dancing almost replaces the central heating in the theater.&quot; Her performance earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. She was then asked to sing &quot;Baby Won&#x27;t You Please Come Home&quot; at President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s private birthday party at the Waldorf Astoria New York, one year after Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s famous &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;. A few months later, Ann-Margret voiced an animated version of herself, named &quot;Ann-Margrock&quot;, on the television series &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. She sang the ballad &quot;The Littlest Lamb&quot; as a lullaby as well as the rocker, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Be a Fool&quot;.

Ann-Margret met Elvis Presley on the MGM soundstage when the two filmed &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; (1964). &quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;She had so much energy and pep that she had blown her previous three male co-stars off screen, but Elvis could match her. He was the best on-screen partner she ever had, and she was his.&quot; She recorded three duets with Presley for the film: &quot;The Lady Loves Me&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Boss&quot;, and &quot;Today, Tomorrow, and Forever&quot;; only &quot;The Lady Loves Me&quot; made it into the final film and none of them were commercially released until years after Presley&#x27;s death, due to concerns by Colonel Tom Parker that Ann-Margret&#x27;s presence threatened to overshadow Elvis. Choreographer David Winters was hired because Ann-Margret was his dance student and recommended him for the job. It was Winters&#x27; first choreographer credit on film. He would go on to become a common collaborator for both Presley and Ann-Margret.

===Decline in fortunes and European sojourn (1965–69)===
&quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; and &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; had established Ann-Margret as Hollywood&#x27;s biggest new star, but a string of box-office flops followed until October 1965. The first, &quot;Kitten with a Whip&quot;, saw Ann-Margret give a &quot;balls-to-the-wall performance&quot; as a juvenile delinquent who entraps a politician. She followed up with &quot;The Pleasure Seekers&quot;, yet another musical romantic comedy. Ann-Margret was excited to do her next project, &quot;Bus Riley&#x27;s Back in Town&quot;; its writer William Inge had penned her favorite film &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961). However Inge was so infuriated by the result that he took his name off the credits of &quot;Bus Riley&quot;. She then featured in &quot;Once a Thief&quot;, a crime film intended to be a star-making vehicle for French actor Alain Delon in the United States. The actress learned decades later that during this time she had been offered the title role in &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;, a critically acclaimed box-office smash that the American Film Institute ranked as the tenth greatest Western film of all time. Her agent had turned down the role without telling her. Ann-Margret broke her flop streak with &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot;, in which she played a femme fatale opposite Steve McQueen. It was her first hit since &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, but her role was not a large one.

While she was working on &quot;Once a Thief&quot;, she met her future husband Roger Smith, who after his successful run on the private-eye television series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, was performing a live club show at the hungry i on a bill with Bill Cosby and Don Adams. That meeting began their courtship, which was met with resistance from her parents.

Ann-Margret starred in four films in 1966. &quot;Made in Paris&quot;, the first of these, was a fashion-focused romantic comedy in which Ann-Margret received top billing. &quot;FilmInk&quot; attributes its box office failure to &quot;dodgy writing and uninspiring male leads&quot;. A month after its release, she teamed up with entertainers Chuck Day and Mickey Jones for a USO tour to entertain U.S. servicemen in South Vietnam and other parts of South-East Asia. A moderately successful remake of the classic John Ford Western &quot;Stagecoach&quot; followed, with Ann-Margret essaying the role of a prostitute. She then starred in the &quot;hopelessly confused&quot; sex comedy &quot;The Swinger&quot; which, in Stephen Vagg&#x27;s words, &quot;came close to killing her Hollywood career more than any other [film] by virtue of its sheer incompetence.&quot; Ann-Margret ended 1966 by featuring in the hit Dean Martin–starrer &quot;Murderers&#x27; Row&quot;, a spy spoof. Looking at Ann-Margret&#x27;s uneven draw at the box office, Vagg points out that after &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, her roles in hit films &quot;had been parts any girl could have played&quot; but the star vehicles that were tailored for her were all flops.

During a lull in her film career in July 1967, Ann-Margret gave her first live performance in Las Vegas, with her husband Roger Smith (whom she had married that May) taking over as her manager after that engagement. Elvis Presley and his entourage came to see her during the show&#x27;s five-week run and celebrate backstage. According to Ann-Margret&#x27;s autobiography, Presley sent her a guitar-shaped floral arrangement for each of her Vegas openings. After the first Vegas run ended, she followed with a CBS television special &quot;The Ann-Margret Show&quot;, produced and directed by David Winters on 1 December 1968, with guest-stars Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Danny Thomas, and Carol Burnett. Then, she returned to Saigon as part of Hope&#x27;s Christmas show. A second CBS television special followed, &quot;Ann-Margret: From Hollywood With Love&quot;, produced, directed and choreographed by David Winters, with guest-stars Dean Martin and Lucille Ball. David Winters and the show were nominated for a Primetime Emmy in Outstanding Choreography.

===Critical acclaim in supporting roles (1970s)===
In 1970, she returned to films with &quot;R. P. M.&quot;, where she starred alongside Anthony Quinn, and &quot;C.C. and Company&quot; with Joe Namath as a biker and her portraying a fashion journalist.

In 1971, she starred in &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; by director Mike Nichols, playing the girlfriend of a neglectful, arguably abusive character played by Jack Nicholson. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. &quot;Filmink&quot; argued this amounted to a comeback &quot;in a way...because she never really regained her former status as an above-the-title star of feature films – her follow-up movies were &#x27;girl&#x27; parts... the seventies were tough times for female stars who were not Barbra Streisand.&quot;

On the set of &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; in Durango, Mexico, in June 1972, she told Nancy Anderson of Copley News Service that she had been on the &quot;grapefruit diet&quot; and had lost almost 20 pounds (134 to 115) eating unsweetened citrus.

On Sunday, 10 September 1972, while performing at Lake Tahoe, she fell from an elevated platform to the stage and suffered injuries including a broken left arm, cheekbone, and jawbone. She required meticulous facial reconstructive surgery that required wiring her mouth shut and putting her on a liquid diet. Unable to work for ten weeks, she returned to the stage almost back to normal.

Throughout the 1970s, Ann-Margret balanced her live musical performances with a string of dramatic film roles that played against her glamorous image. In 1973, she starred with John Wayne in &quot;The Train Robbers&quot;. Then came the musical &quot;Tommy&quot; in 1975, for which she received her second Oscar nomination, this time for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In addition, she has been nominated for ten Golden Globe Awards, winning five, including her Best ActressMotion Picture Comedy or Musical for &quot;Tommy.&quot; 
On 17 August 1977, Ann-Margret and Roger Smith traveled to Memphis to attend Elvis Presley&#x27;s funeral. Three months later, she hosted &quot;Memories of Elvis&quot; featuring abridged versions of the &quot;Elvis&quot; 1968 TV and &quot;Aloha from Hawaii&quot; specials.

Other notable films she co-starred in during the late 1970s include &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; (1977), &quot;The Last Remake of Beau Geste&quot; (1977), the horror/suspense thriller &quot;Magic&quot; (1978) with Anthony Hopkins. She had a cameo in &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978).

Ann-Margret was an early choice of Allan Carr&#x27;s to play the role of Sandy Dumbrowski in the 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot;. At 36 years of age when filming commenced, she was ultimately determined to be too old to convincingly play the role of a high school student. Twenty-eight-year-old Olivia Newton-John got the role instead, and the character was renamed &quot;Sandy Olsson&quot; (after Ann-Margret&#x27;s birth surname) in her honor.

For her contributions to the film industry, Ann-Margret received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1973. Her star is located at 6501 Hollywood Boulevard.

===Television-movie era (1980s)===
Ann-Margret starred opposite Bruce Dern in &quot;Middle Age Crazy&quot; (1980). In 1982, she co-starred with Walter Matthau and Dinah Manoff in the film version of Neil Simon&#x27;s play &quot;I Ought to Be in Pictures&quot;. That same year also saw the release of &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot;, filmed two years prior in 1980, in which she co-starred with Jon Voight and played the mother of a five-year-old Angelina Jolie in Jolie&#x27;s screen debut. To round out 1982, she appeared alongside Alan Bates, Glenda Jackson, and Julie Christie in the film adaptation of &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot;. She also starred in the TV movies &quot;Who Will Love My Children?&quot; (1983) and a remake of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1984), winning Golden Globe Awards for both performances.

After Barbara Stanwyck won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie in 1983 for her role in &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, she mentioned Ann-Margret&#x27;s performance in &quot;Who Will Love My Children?&quot;, stating at the podium &quot;I would like to pay a personal tribute at this time to a lady who is a wonderful entertainer...I think she gave one of the finest, most beautiful performances I have ever seen...Ann-Margret, you were superb.&quot;

In &quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot; (1985) Ann-Margret portrayed a waitress for whom Gene Hackman&#x27;s character left his wife. The next year she appeared as the wife of Roy Scheider&#x27;s character in the crime thriller &quot;52 Pick-Up&quot;. In 1987 she co-starred with Elizabeth Ashley (and also with Claudette Colbert, in the last on-screen role of the film legend&#x27;s career) in the NBC two-part series &quot;The Two Mrs. Grenvilles&quot;. It earned Ann-Margret another Emmy Award nomination, this time for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Mini Series or a Special.

In 1989, an illustration of Oprah Winfrey appeared on the cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, and although the head was Oprah&#x27;s, the body was from a 1979 publicity shot of Ann-Margret. The illustration was rendered so tightly in color pencil by freelance artist Chris Notarile that most people thought it was a composite photograph.

===Continuing film and television career (1990–present)===
In 1991, she starred in the TV film &quot;Our Sons&quot; opposite Julie Andrews as mothers of sons who are lovers, one of whom is dying of AIDS. In 1992, she co-starred with Robert Duvall and Christian Bale in the Disney musical &quot;Newsies&quot;. In 1993, Ann-Margret starred in the hit comedy &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; reuniting with Matthau and Jack Lemmon. Her character returned for &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot; (1995), the equally successful sequel which this time co-starred Sophia Loren.

Ann-Margret published an autobiography in 1994 titled &quot;Ann-Margret: My Story&quot;, in which she publicly acknowledged her battle with and ongoing recovery from alcoholism. She played Belle Watling in &quot;Scarlett&quot; (1994), a television miniseries loosely based on the 1991 book of the same name written by Alexandra Ripley as a sequel to Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked her tenth on its list of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history.

She also filmed &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; (1999) for director Oliver Stone, portraying the mother of football team owner Cameron Diaz. She filmed a cameo appearance for &quot;The Limey&quot;, but her performance was cut from the movie.

Ann-Margret also starred in several television films, including &quot;&quot; (1993), &quot;Following Her Heart&quot; (1994), and &quot;Life of the Party&quot; (1999), the latter of which she received nominations for an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

In 2000, she recorded the theme song, a modified version of the &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; theme, to the live-action film &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot;.

She made guest appearances on the television show &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; in 2000 and three episodes of &quot;Third Watch&quot; in 2003. In 2001, she made her first appearance in a stage musical, playing the character of brothel owner Mona Stangley in a new touring production of &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;. The production co-starred Gary Sandy and Ed Dixon. She played Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s mother in the 2004 comedy &quot;Taxi&quot;, co-starring Queen Latifah. In 2001, Ann-Margret worked with Art Greenhaw on the album &quot;God Is Love: The Gospel Sessions&quot;. The project resulted in her second Grammy Award nomination and first Dove Award nomination for Best Album of the Year in a Gospel category. They teamed up again in 2004 for the album &quot;Ann-Margret&#x27;s Christmas Carol Collection&quot;. She performed material from the album at two auditorium church services at Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California, and broadcast worldwide on the program &quot;Hour of Power&quot;.

In November 2005, Ann-Margret reunited with Chuck Day and Mickey Jones for an encore of their 1966 USO tour for veterans and troops at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.

In 2006, Ann-Margret had supporting roles in the box-office hits &quot;The Break-Up&quot; with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, and &quot;The Santa Clause 3&quot; with Tim Allen. She also starred in several independent films, such as &quot;Memory&quot; (2006) with Billy Zane and Dennis Hopper. In 2009, she appeared in the comedy &quot;Old Dogs&quot; with John Travolta and Robin Williams.

Ann-Margret guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Bedtime&quot;, which first aired on 31March 2010, on NBC.

In 2014, she began appearing in a recurring role in the Showtime original series &quot;Ray Donovan&quot;. On 1 October 2018, it was announced that she had joined the second season of the Syfy series &quot;Happy!&quot; in a recurring role.

<doc id="225505" wikidata="Q920218" url="?curid=225505" title="The Story of Adele H.">
<text>The Story of Adèle H. () is a 1975 French historical drama film directed by François Truffaut, and starring Isabelle Adjani, Bruce Robinson, and Sylvia Marriott. Written by Truffaut, Jean Gruault, and Suzanne Schiffman, the film is about Adèle Hugo, the daughter of writer Victor Hugo, whose obsessive unrequited love for a military officer leads to her downfall. The story is based on Adèle Hugo&#x27;s diaries. Filming took place on location in Guernsey and Senegal.

20-year-old Isabelle Adjani received much critical acclaim for her performance as Hugo, garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role, making her the youngest Best Actress nominee ever at the time. &quot;The Story of Adèle H.&quot; also won the National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics Award for Best Film, and the Cartagena Film Festival Special Critics Award.

==Plot==
In 1863, the American Civil War is raging, and Great Britain and France have yet to enter into the conflict. For the past year, British troops have been stationed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, carefully checking European passengers disembarking from foreign ships. The beautiful Adèle Hugo, the second daughter of Victor Hugo, makes it through and takes a carriage into Halifax. Traveling under the assumed name of Miss Lewly, Adèle finds accommodations at a boarding house run by Mr. and Mrs. Saunders.

Adèle finds a notary and inquires about a British officer, Lieutenant Albert Pinson, with whom she&#x27;s had a relationship. Later that day Adèle sees Pinson at a book shop. When she learns that Mr. Saunders will be attending a military dinner which Pinson is likely to attend, Adèle asks him to deliver a letter from her—a love letter announcing her arrival. While showing some old photographs to Mrs. Saunders, she talks about her older sister Léopoldine Hugo, who died in a drowning accident at the age of 19 many years before, just after being married. When Mr. Saunders returns from the dinner, he tells her that he gave Pinson her letter but he did not reply. That night, Adèle has nightmares about drowning.

The next day, Adèle writes to her parents, telling them that she must be with her beloved Pinson and that they are planning to marry, but she will wait for their formal consent. She spends her evenings writing in her journal about her life and her love for Pinson. &quot;I&#x27;ll be able to win him over through gentleness&quot;, she writes. Pinson goes to the boarding house, where he tells Adèle that she must leave Halifax and must stop following him. Adèle believes that if they marry, all his concerns will be resolved. Pinson knows that her parents do not approve of him and his heavy gambling debts. Adèle tries to persuade him, telling him that she&#x27;s rejected another marriage proposal, threatens to expose him and ruin his military career, and even offers him money for his gambling debts, but he remains unmoved.

In the coming days, Adèle continues writing in her journal, convinced that she is Pinson&#x27;s wife in spirit. She tries to conjure the ghost of her dead sister to help her. One night, she follows Pinson to the home of his much older mistress, where she watches them having sex. Undeterred, Adèle continues her writing, and her behavior becomes more eccentric. Mr. Whistler, the kind bookseller who provides her with writing paper, shows an interest in her. As she leaves his book shop, she faints from exhaustion. Mr. Whistler visits her at the boarding house and brings her paper, but she refuses to see him. Doctor Murdock visits and diagnoses a mild case of pleurisy. He notices one of her letters is addressed to Victor Hugo and informs Mrs. Saunders of the true identity of her boarder.

Adèle&#x27;s obsession grows stronger. One day, she writes to her parents telling them that she has married Pinson and that from now on, she should be addressed as Madame Pinson. Upon receiving the news, Victor Hugo posts an announcement of the marriage in his local paper. The news reaches Pinson&#x27;s colonel. After Pinson writes Victor Hugo to explain that he never will marry Adèle, Hugo writes to his daughter, urging her to return home to Guernsey. Adèle responds to her father&#x27;s letter with more fantasy, urging her parents to accept Pinson.

Having learned of Adèle&#x27;s identity, Mr. Whistler offers her a gift of her father&#x27;s books. She responds in anger and paranoia. She hires a prostitute as a gift for Pinson. She follows him to a theater to see a hypnotist, where she is inspired to think that she can hypnotize Pinson into loving her; she is forced to abandon this plan once she learns that the hypnosis was faked. Adèle begins to go mad with despair. She goes to the father of Pinson&#x27;s fiancée and claims that he is married to her and that she is carrying his child. The father ends the engagement. She finds Pinson once more, and he again rebukes her, calling her ridiculous. After leaving the boarding house, Adèle continues to deteriorate. She wanders the streets in torn clothes, talking to herself.

In February 1864, Pinson is shipped out to Barbados, and a destitute Adèle follows him. Now married, Pinson learns that Adèle is in Barbados claiming to be his wife. Concerned for her, Pinson searches for her and finds her wandering the streets in rags. When he tries to confront her, Adèle does not acknowledge or recognize him. Helped by a kind former slave, Adèle returns to Paris, where the French Third Republic has been established. Her father places her in an asylum in Saint-Mandé, where she lives for the next 40 years. She gardens, plays the piano and writes in her journal. Adèle Hugo dies in Paris in 1915 at the age of 85.

==Cast==
François Truffaut has a brief, wordless cameo in the film as an officer Adele mistakes for Pinson in Halifax.

==Production==
Writing about the film, François Truffaut observed:
Truffaut had to get the rights from Jean Hugo, Victor Hugo&#x27;s direct descendant. He gave his consent after reading a treatment on the condition that Victor Hugo did not appear on screen.

Finance was originally sought from Warner Bros but they turned it down as being too literary. The film was financed by United Artists. The original budget was five million francs so the script was simplified to focus more on Adèle.

Although Truffaut had once promised the role of Adèle to Catherine Deneuve, he decided he wanted a new star to play the lead. He screen tested Stacey Tendeter, who had co-starred in his 1971 film &quot;Two English Girls&quot;, but, after seeing Isabelle Adjani&#x27;s performances in &quot;La Gifle&quot; (1974) and on stage, he then decided to cast her. At that time, Adjani was under contract as a stage actress to the Comédie-Française, which refused to release her from her contract. There was a legal dispute, but, in the end, Adjani was able to play the part.

===Filming locations===
Most of the film&#x27;s exterior scenes were shot on location in Guernsey, Channel Islands, and many of the film extras were well-known locals. Both Raymond Falla (who portrayed Judge Johnstone) and Sir Cecil de Sausmarez (who portrayed Lenoir, the notary) were, at the time of filming, prominent island politicians. Scenes set in Halifax were mainly interiors created in a house in St. Peter Port, Guernsey. No filming took place in Halifax. The scenes set in Barbados were shot on the island of Gorée off the coast of Senegal.

As was his custom, Truffaut fell for his leading lady during the shoot. However, Adjani rebuffed his advances. She did not like to rehearse, and filming in Guernsey was an intense emotional experience for most of the crew. Truffaut later wrote to a friend:
You mention the pleasure I must have directing Isabelle A. It&#x27;s the opposite of pleasure, it&#x27;s daily suffering for me, and almost an agony for her. For her profession is her religion, and because of that our shoot is a trial for everyone. It would be too easy to say she is difficult, she is not. She is different from all the women in this profession and since she isn&#x27;t even 20, add to all this (to her genius, let&#x27;s not be afraid of words), an unawareness of others and their vulnerability, which creates an unbelievable tension.

The film was shot in both English and French.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
In her book &quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot;, the American film critic Pauline Kael gave the film a very positive review: 
In his review in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, calling it &quot;a strange, moody film that belongs very much with the darker side of [Truffaut&#x27;s] work.&quot; Ebert continued:
In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby called the film &quot;profoundly beautiful&quot;, and Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;most severe, most romantic meditation upon love.&quot; Canby continued:
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 93% positive rating based on reviews from 27 top film critics, with an average score of 8.1/10.

===Box office===
&quot;The Story of Adèle H.&quot; was a modest financial success in France, where it sold 752,160 tickets, but it was considered a box office disappointment.

<text>Stockwell Burt Day Jr. (born August 16, 1950) is a former Canadian politician who served as leader of the Canadian Alliance from 2000 to 2001 and later as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.

A provincial cabinet minister from Alberta, Day served as minister of labour, minister of social services, and treasurer under Premier Ralph Klein. He successfully ran for leader of the newly formed Canadian Alliance against former Reform Party leader Preston Manning, winning that position on July 8, 2000. Following his election as leader, Day won the by-election to become the member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Okanagan—Coquihalla in British Columbia. In the 2000 federal election, the Alliance under Day only made modest gains, increasing their seat count from 58 to 66. A breakthrough in the East did not happen, and the Liberal Party under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien won a third consecutive majority government.

After the election, Day&#x27;s leadership of the party was met with criticism, with a caucus revolt taking place. Following the election, Day lost his role as leader, but continued to serve as an MP. He then held several cabinet portfolios under Prime Minister Stephen Harper and was widely seen as a prominent voice for social conservatives within the Conservative Party. Day did not seek re-election in the 2011 federal election.

== Early life and career ==
Day was born in Barrie, Ontario, the son of Gwendolyn &quot;Gwen&quot; (née Gilbert) and Stockwell Day Sr. He lived in a number of places in Canada during his youth, including Atlantic Canada; Ottawa, where he attended Ashbury College; and Montreal, where he graduated from Westmount High School. He attended the University of Victoria and Vanguard College, then known as Northwest Bible College, in Edmonton, Alberta, but did not graduate from either.

His father, who was born in Montreal, was long associated with the Social Credit Party of Canada. In the 1972 federal election, he was the Social Credit candidate running against New Democratic Party leader Tommy Douglas in the riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan—The Islands. Day Sr. supported Doug Christie and was a member of the Western Canada Concept.

From 1978 to 1985, Day was assistant pastor and school administrator at the Bentley Christian Centre in Bentley, Alberta. His school taught the Accelerated Christian Education curriculum.

==Career in provincial politics==
In 1986, Day was elected to represent Red Deer North in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Progressive Conservative (PC), a position that he held until 2000.

In December 1992, newly elected Alberta premier Ralph Klein brought Day into his cabinet as his minister of labour, a position in which he oversaw controversial changes in his ministry, including layoffs in the civil service. In this role, Day was credited with working with all of Alberta&#x27;s Public Service Unions to achieve an unprecedented five per cent voluntary reduction in their collective agreements. While Day was minister of labour, Alberta had the lowest number of days lost due to labour disputes of any province. As Minister Responsible for the Worker&#x27;s Compensation Board, Day oversaw the elimination of the Compensation Board&#x27;s unfunded liability of $600 million. This led to a general reduction in premiums for businesses and a general increase in workers&#x27; benefits.

In October 1994, Government House Leader was added to his responsibility. In May 1996, Day was made Minister of Social Services and, in March 1997, he became Treasurer. As Treasurer, Day oversaw a continued paying down of Alberta&#x27;s debt while he cut taxes, instituting a flat tax rate in 1999.

In April 1999, while Day was still Treasurer, he wrote a letter criticizing Red Deer lawyer and public school board trustee Lorne Goddard for representing a defendant who was ultimately convicted on charges of possessing child pornography. In the letter, Day suggested that Goddard&#x27;s argument in court that the Canadian Constitution protected his client&#x27;s right to possess child pornography implied that he himself believed that pedophiles have the right to own such materials and that this further implies that he also must believe that teachers should have the right to pornographic images of their students.

In response, Goddard sued Day for defamation. The suit was eventually settled on December 22, 2000, in the plaintiff&#x27;s favour. According to an adjudication order from the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta, the total settlement cost for the suit was $792,064.40, including $60,000 in damages paid to the plaintiff, costs that were paid by Alberta taxpayers. However, Day eventually paid back the Alberta Government the $60,000 in damages out of his own pocket. Additionally, Day later wrote a letter to a local paper in his riding as a member of Parliament expressing deep regret &quot;that my former friend Lorne Goddard and his family, have been personally hurt.&quot;

== Leadership of the Canadian Alliance ==

In 2000, Day decided to run for leader of the newly formed Canadian Alliance party. After a heavily publicized campaign, Day came in first on the June 24 first ballot of the leadership election with about 44 per cent of the vote, in front of former Reform Party leader Preston Manning and Ontario PC strategist Tom Long. In the following runoff election against Manning, held on July 8, 2000, Day received 63.4 per cent.

Looking for a way to get into Parliament, Day decided against running in his hometown riding of Red Deer, even though it was comfortably safe for the Alliance. Instead, he ran in a by-election in the equally safe riding of Okanagan—Coquihalla, British Columbia after incumbent Reform/CA MP Jim Hart stood down in his favour—a standard practice in most parliamentary systems when a newly elected leader doesn&#x27;t have a seat in Parliament. Day won the by-election on September 11, 2000, arriving at his first news conference on a Jet Ski wearing a wetsuit.

===2000 election===

A few weeks after Day entered the House of Commons, Jean Chrétien called a snap election for November 27, 2000, which would not give the newly formed Canadian Alliance time to consolidate itself. Nonetheless, the new party went into the election with high hopes, as Day was expected to appeal far more to the crucial Ontario voters than his predecessors.

There were few, if any, important issues when the election was called; nonetheless, the Liberals frequently alleged that Day had a hidden agenda, identifying Day with the Christian right, and drawing attention to his past comments about homosexuality and abortion.

In an interview published in the alternative weekly &quot;Montreal Mirror&quot; on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a &quot;mental disorder&quot;. He acknowledged having gay staff working on his campaign: &quot;First of all, as far as my campaign, I don&#x27;t ask people if they&#x27;re homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn&#x27;t mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they&#x27;re saying we think you can take this Alliance to the next step and we think you&#x27;d be good for Canada. So I don&#x27;t ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign.&quot; But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day&#x27;s acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied &quot;Yes, and the reason I say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow for the use of the Notwithstanding Clause. That&#x27;s because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue.&quot;

Liberal activist Warren Kinsella mocked Day&#x27;s belief in young Earth creationism by pulling out a Barney doll during a television interview and stating that &quot;this was the only dinosaur ever to be on Earth with humans&quot;. Media covering the Day campaign bus, nicknamed &quot;Prayer Force One&quot;, hummed &quot;The Flintstones&quot; theme song to mock the idea that humans and dinosaurs co-existed.

During the 2000 election, the CBC ran an extended documentary purporting to review Day&#x27;s religious beliefs. In this documentary the CBC interviewed Professor Pliny Hayes, Chair of the Department of Natural Sciences at Red Deer College, who reported that Day said in a speech at the college that there is scientific proof that the world is about 6,000 years old and that early man co-existed with dinosaurs. Day filed a complaint with the CBC for the fact that he was at no time asked for comment on the matter.

When subsequently asked by reporters about his beliefs, Day said he didn&#x27;t think his beliefs &quot;should be used in any kind of detrimental way in an election campaign.&quot; Day&#x27;s spokesman Phil Von Finckenstein said the Alliance believes that other theories of creation should be taught alongside evolution in schools, but he also recognizes education is a provincial jurisdiction.

The Alliance&#x27;s direct democracy proposals, which would have required a referendum on any proposal supported by a petition signed by three per cent of Canadian voters, were also frequently targeted as a suggestion of a hidden agenda. Some asserted that &quot;special interest&quot; groups would use the low requirements to put contentious subjects to a national referendum. Day himself never did support the threshold, explaining that he would need to consult with Canadians over what the threshold should be. The proposal was satirized by Rick Mercer of &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, where he proposed a national petition for a referendum to demand that Day change his first name to Doris, which reached the threshold advocated by The Alliance.

Another gaffe took place when the Day campaign used the hit single &quot;Ordinary Day&quot; by Great Big Sea at a rally without permission. The band demanded that Day&#x27;s campaign cease using the song for campaigning purposes.

Day was also a victim of an incident during the election. When making a &quot;grand entrance&quot; for a speech at Conestoga College, activist Julian Ichim splashed him with two litres of chocolate milk from the front of the stage, saying he did it to protest Day&#x27;s &quot;homophobic, anti-immigrant and anti-poor agenda&quot;. Afterward, again on &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, actress Mary Walsh jokingly offered Day chocolate milk, saying: &quot;All they had was homo, and I knew [Day] wouldn&#x27;t like that.&quot;

Day stumbled during two campaign appearances in the first week. A photo-op at a technology firm meant to illustrate a &quot;brain drain&quot; to the US was undermined when the owner reported that he had moved &quot;to&quot; Canada from the United States eight years earlier. The next day, at Niagara Falls, Day remarked that Canadian jobs were flowing south &quot;just like the Niagara River&quot;, when in fact the river flows north. In mid-campaign, the Alliance candidate in Winnipeg South Centre, Betty Granger, was quoted as voicing concerns about an &quot;Asian invasion&quot; in Canada. And in the televised leaders&#x27; debate, Day held up a handwritten sign saying &quot;NO 2-TIER HEALTHCARE&quot; in large letters to counter a newspaper headline in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; earlier in the campaign. As props were against the rules, he claimed it was his briefing notes. Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark retorted, &quot;Mr. Day appears to be running for office as some kind of game show host.&quot; The debate went poorly for Day, with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; describing him as &quot;the big loser&quot; of the night.

At one point, the Alliance was at 30.5 per cent in the polls, and some thought they could win a minority government. On election night, the Alliance increased their seats over Reform totals from 60 to 66 and kept Reform&#x27;s strong representation in western Canada, but the hoped-for breakthrough in Ontario did not occur, with the party electing just two MPs in that province. However, the Alliance increased their overall vote totals by over one million and reduced the Progressive Conservatives to 12 seats in the House of Commons. The Liberals&#x27; attacks on Day ended up decimating the NDP and Progressive Conservatives, as many voters who would otherwise have supported those parties voted strategically for the Liberals to prevent an Alliance victory.

===Post-election===

Further controversies plagued Day following the election. While he had been a government minister in Alberta he wrote a letter to the editor of the &quot;Red Deer Advocate&quot; in April 1999 in which he criticized Lorne Goddard, a lawyer and Red Deer school trustee, for defending a man accused of possessing child pornography. In it he alleged that Goddard himself supported child pornography. When Goddard sued for libel, the Alberta government covered Day&#x27;s legal bills. In December, the government lawyers settled out of court, but the legal costs and settlement totalled $792,000. A citizen&#x27;s fund was set up on behalf of taxpayers to cover the lawyers&#x27; charges. Even though thousands of dollars began coming in from across the country, Alberta&#x27;s Ethics Commissioner ruled that the voluntary fund could not be used. Day was criticized for the costs and eventually re-paid the province $60,000, the settlement amount excluding legal fees. Further controversy ensued in February when it was reported that Bennett Jones, the law firm that had represented Day at taxpayer expense, donated $70,000 to the Canadian Alliance Fund shortly after Day settled. The Alliance launched an internal review that determined that nothing inappropriate had occurred.

In April, it was reported that Day had approved the hiring of a private investigator to dig up dirt to smear the Liberals. After confirming that he had met the man on April 7, Day denied this on the 8th, claiming on the 9th that he had read of the meeting in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and had assumed that it was correct. Day later made it clear that he never did hire or approve of the hiring of an investigator.

Given the string of negative stories, many Alliance members became increasingly critical of Day&#x27;s leadership. In late April, several members of Day&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet, including deputy leader Deborah Grey, resigned their posts. In the following months, Grey and eleven other MPs either resigned or were suspended from caucus for criticizing Day. This group, led by Chuck Strahl and Grey, formed the &quot;Independent Alliance Caucus&quot; during the summer. Day offered an amnesty, but seven of them turned it down and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus, led by Strahl and Grey. The DRC entered a short-lived coalition agreement with the Tories, which was seen as an attempt by PC leader Joe Clark to reunite the Canadian right on his terms.

== Political career after leadership ==

In the fall of 2001, Day agreed to step aside and re-contest the leadership, and in the March 2002 Alliance leadership election, Day was defeated by Stephen Harper on the first ballot. As a concession to Day, Harper appointed him as foreign affairs critic. Five of the seven DRC MPs (all except Inky Mark and Jim Pankiw) rejoined the Alliance caucus on April 10.

In March 2003, Day and Harper co-wrote a letter to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in which they condemned the Canadian government&#x27;s unwillingness to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Day later appeared as a speaker at a &quot;Canadians for Bush&quot; rally in the Niagara region, organized by controversial right-wing minister Tristan Emmanuel.

In December 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party merged to become the Conservative Party of Canada. Day did not run for the leadership of the new party but remained the party&#x27;s foreign affairs critic. He was re-elected to Parliament in the 2004, 2006, and 2008 elections.

In November 2004, Day provoked controversy by not offering condolences to Palestinians after the death of PLO leader Yasser Arafat. The controversy was heightened when it was leaked to the media that Day had attempted to justify his actions to his party colleagues by circulating an article by David Frum that suggested that Arafat had died of AIDS.

In March 2007, the federal Liberals accused former Alliance MP Jim Hart of having accepted a payment of $50,000 to step aside in favour of Day before the 2000 byelection. Contacted at his home in the Republic of Georgia, Hart—in a brief email statement to the CBC—did not deny the allegations or impeach the authenticity of the evidence the Liberals had obtained. The entire matter was investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who found no evidence of wrongdoing.

On March 23, 2008, Stockwell Day signed the Canada-Israel &#x27;Declaration of Intent&#x27; on &#x27;public safety&#x27; and security cooperation between the two countries, as Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. It was co-signed in Tel-Aviv by Israel&#x27;s Minister of Public Security, Avi Dichter. Months later in May 2008, Day attended and participated in the 1st International Security Forum of Ministers of Interior and
Homeland Security in Jerusalem.

In August 2010, Day caused some controversy when he stated the government was &quot;very concerned ... about the increase in the amount of unreported crimes that surveys clearly show are happening&quot;. Critics question the supporting evidence of the minister as data pertaining to unreported crimes for 2009 had not yet been released.

On March 12, 2011, Day announced that he would not be seeking re-election in the 2011 federal election.

===Minister of Public Safety (February 2006-October 2008)===

On February 6, 2006, Day was promoted to the Minister of Public Safety in the Conservative government and was sworn into the Privy Council. When, in May 2008, Israeli Ambassador Alan Baker warned that Canada&#x27;s Muslim population would influence its policies, Day responded by saying that Canada was proud of its multicultural composition.

===Minister of International Trade (October 2008-January 2010)===

On October 30, 2008, Day was sworn in as Minister of International Trade in the Conservative Government. He was also appointed the Minister for the Asia–Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative.

===President of Treasury Board (January 2010-March 2011)===

Day was appointed president of the Treasury Board by Stephen Harper on January 19, 2010.

During the controversy over the Harper government&#x27;s decision to eliminate the mandatory long-form census, Day defended the move by implying that online web searches are as effective as the national census: &quot;We live in an information age where any 12-year-old kid can push any button on the Internet and find out any information he or she wants without threatening a citizen that they&#x27;re going to go to jail.&quot;

In March 2011, Day announced that he would not seek re-election in the next federal elections.

== Post-political career ==
After retiring from politics Day started a government relations firm, called Stockwell Day Connex. On June 14, 2011, the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada appointed Day as a Distinguished Fellow and he remained in this role until 2016. Day also currently holds a position on the board of directors for the Canada China Business Council. He also previously sat on the boards of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs and the Canada-India Business Council.

Day was a member of the board of directors of Telus and a senior strategic advisor to Canadian law firm McMillan LLP from 2011 to June 2020, when he resigned from both positions after comments he made on CBC News Network&#x27;s &quot;Power &amp; Politics&quot; amidst the George Floyd protests triggered strong social media reaction including the threat of a boycott of Telus if he did not resign. In the televised debate, Day&#x27;s comments included deploring the murder of George Floyd, supporting the right of people to protest and opposing the riots and destruction in US cities. Day had said that systemic racism did not exist in Canada and referenced his experience of being bullied as a child for wearing glasses, suggesting it was the same as having to endure racism. Day noted the difference between the Floyd family asking for the violence to stop with the reaction of a number of celebrities who were not condemning the violence and offering to pay the bill of arrested people. Day also said that while Canada has some &quot;idiot racists&quot;, he felt that most Canadians are not racist. Day disagreed with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s claim that Canada is a &quot;systematically racist&quot; country, while noting improvements can always be made. Day apologized the next day to those who had been hurt by any of his comments and vowed to continue the fight against racism in all its forms.

Since October 2021, Day has served as the interim president of the King&#x27;s College, a small Christian liberal arts college in New York City, located in the financial district. King&#x27;s College accepted a $2 million loan from billionaire owner of Primacorp Ventures, Peter Chung, in April 2021. Day has previously worked as a consultant for Chung, and was appointed to the College&#x27;s executive as part of the deal - a move students and staff raised alarms about at the time. Additionally, Peter Chung&#x27;s career is rife with investments into institutions that soon afterwards failed - notably, Wilshire Computer College in California, a case in which he refused to pay students of the institution a court-ordered $12 million in compensation. Other failed investments include Quest University in British Columbia (which ceased operations in April 2023) and CDI College across Canada, which has been criticized for falsely advertising its accreditation status and job placement rates.

== AWZ Ventures ==
From 2015 to 2017, Day was a Director at AWZ Ventures, a Canadian private investment company which invests in Israeli cybersecurity, intelligence, and physical security technologies.

<doc id="225514" wikidata="Q2559966" url="?curid=225514" title="Hedda (1975 film)">
<text>Hedda is a 1975 film adaptation of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s 1891 play &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, written for the screen and directed by Trevor Nunn, and starring Glenda Jackson, Timothy West, Peter Eyre, Patrick Stewart (in his screen debut), and Jennie Linden. The plot involves the experiences of the title character, Hedda (Jackson), the daughter of a general, who is trapped in a marriage and a house that she does not want.

This film was the first (and, as of 2023, the only) major theatrical film version of the play in English. Other productions of the play in English with sound have been made for television.

&quot;Hedda&quot; earned Jackson her fourth and final nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as a third nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. It was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film. The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn&#x27;t entered into the main competition.

* Timothy West - Judge Brack

==Reception==
===Reaction===
AllMovie rated the film 3-stars-out-of-5 and described it as &quot;a tasteful, literate cinematic translation of the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby praised Jackson&#x27;s performance: &quot;This version of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; is all Miss Jackson&#x27;s Hedda and, I must say, great fun to watch ... Miss Jackson&#x27;s technical virtuosity is particularly suited to a character like Hedda. Her command of her voice and her body,&quot; and concluded, &quot;the physical production is handsome, and Mr. Nunn is most successful in preserving the claustrophobic nature of the play without creating a static film. &quot;Hedda&quot; is an imaginative, intelligent film version of a play that I wasn&#x27;t breathlessly waiting to see at this moment.&quot;

Judith Crist of &quot;Saturday Review&quot; wrote: &quot;a startlingly fresh and perceptive version written and directed by Trevor Nunn and ingeniously interpreted by Jackson. Seldom has a classic been so well served.&quot; J.C. Trewin wrote in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;: &quot;No Hedda, seeking an object she cannot determine, has been more infinitely bored, or more dangerous.&quot; Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of &quot;Spirituality &amp; Practice&quot; called the film &quot;A fine screen interpretation of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play&quot; and singled out Jackson&#x27;s performance for praise: &quot;Glenda Jackson&#x27;s Hedda battles with the trolls in her heart. She is quite believable as a woman who wants more than anything else the power over other people&#x27;s lives. When she is denied this right — traditionally a male reserve in her society — the results are grim.&quot;

<doc id="225516" wikidata="Q687182" url="?curid=225516" title="Whistler's Mother">
<text>Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1, best known under its colloquial name Whistler&#x27;s Mother or Portrait of Artist&#x27;s Mother, is a painting in oils on canvas created by the American-born painter James McNeill Whistler in 1871. The subject of the painting is Whistler&#x27;s mother, Anna McNeill Whistler. The painting is , displayed in a frame of Whistler&#x27;s own design. It is held by the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris, having been bought by the French state in 1891. It is one of the most famous works by an American artist outside the United States. It has been variously described as an American icon and a Victorian &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;.

==History==

Anna McNeill Whistler posed for the painting while living in London with her son at 96 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea.

Several unverifiable stories relate to the painting of the work; one is that Anna Whistler acted as a replacement for another model who could not make the appointment. Whistler originally envisioned painting the model standing up. However, his mother was too uncomfortable to pose standing for an extended period.

The work was shown at the 104th Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Art in London (1872), after coming within a hair&#x27;s breadth of rejection by the academy. This episode worsened the rift between Whistler and the British art world; &quot;Arrangement&quot; was the last painting he submitted for the academy&#x27;s approval (although his etching of Old Putney Bridge was exhibited there in 1879). Vol. VIII of &quot;The Royal Academy of Arts: A Complete Dictionary of Contributors and their work from its foundation in 1769 to 1904&quot; (by Algernon Graves, F.S.A., London 1906) lists the 1872 exhibit as no. 941, &quot;Arrangement in Grey and Black: Portrait of the Painter&#x27;s mother&quot;, and gives Whistler&#x27;s address as The White House, Chelsea Embankment.

The sensibilities of a Victorian era viewing audience would not accept what was a portrait exhibited as an &quot;arrangement&quot;, hence the addition of the explanatory title &quot;Portrait of the Painter&#x27;s mother&quot;. From this, the work acquired its enduring nickname of simply &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;. After Thomas Carlyle viewed the painting, he agreed to sit for a similar composition, this one titled &quot;Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 2&quot;. Thus the previous painting became, by default, &quot;Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 1&quot;.


Whistler eventually pawned the painting, acquired in 1891 by Paris&#x27;s Musée du Luxembourg. Whistler&#x27;s works, including this one, had attracted several imitators. Numerous similarly posed and restricted-colour palette paintings soon appeared, particularly by American expatriate painters. For Whistler, having one of his paintings displayed in a major museum helped attract wealthy patrons. In December 1884, Whistler wrote:

As a proponent of &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;, Whistler professed to be perplexed and annoyed by the insistence of others upon viewing his work as a &quot;portrait&quot;. In his 1890 book &quot;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&quot;, he wrote:

Both &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot; and &quot;Thomas Carlyle&quot; were engraved by the English engraver Richard Josey. The image has been used since the Victorian era as an icon for motherhood, affection for parents, and &quot;family values&quot; in general, especially in the United States. For example, in 1934, the U.S. Post Office Department issued a stamp engraved with the portrait detail from &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;, bearing the slogan &quot;In memory and in honor of the mothers of America.&quot; In the Borough of Ashland, Pennsylvania, an eight-foot-high statue based on the painting was erected as a tribute to mothers by the Ashland Boys&#x27; Association in 1938, during the Great Depression.

In summing up the painting&#x27;s influence, art historian Martha Tedeschi has stated:

==Exhibitions in America==
&quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot; has been exhibited several times in the United States, notably at the Century of Progress world&#x27;s fair in Chicago in 1933–34. It was shown at the Atlanta Art Association in the fall of 1962, the National Gallery of Art in 1994, and the Detroit Institute of Arts in 2004. It was exhibited at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1983 in an exhibition called &quot;A New World: Masterpieces of American Painting 1760- 1910.&quot;

From May 22 to September 6, 2010, it was shown at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. The painting was exhibited at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California, from March 27 to June 22, 2015, at the Colby College Museum of Art in Maine, and then the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 2016 . It was shown at the Art Institute of Chicago from March 4 to May 21, 2017. From 10 June to 29 October 2023, it was on display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

==In popular culture==

The painting has been featured or mentioned in numerous works of fiction and within pop culture. These include films such as &quot;Sing and Like It&quot; (1934), the Donald Duck shorts &quot;Early to Bed&quot; (1941) &amp; &quot;Donald&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1954), &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot; (1966), &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; (1986), &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot; (1991), &quot;Bean&quot; (1997), &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; (2000), &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003), &quot;I Am Legend&quot; (2007), and &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&quot; (2013).

It has been mentioned in television episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Rosebud&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Trillions&quot;, and &quot;The Burns and the Bees&quot;).

The painting is mentioned in Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;Lolita.&quot;

The painting is central to the plot of the 1997 comedy film &quot;Bean&quot;, in which Mr. Bean accidentally defaces it during its repatriation to the United States and secretly replaces it with a poster.

Actor Hurd Hatfield toured internationally several times with the play &quot;Son of Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot; by playwright Maggie Williams.

Between 1959 and 2021, the Douglas A-26 Invader serial number 41-39401 was either flown or displayed with the name of &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;. It featured a reproduction of the painting on the nose.

==In music==
Whistler, and particularly this painting, had a profound effect on Claude Debussy, a contemporary French composer. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist Eugène Ysaÿe describing his &quot;Nocturnes&quot; as &quot;an experiment in the different combinations that can be obtained from one color – what a study in grey would be in painting.&quot; Whether Debussy used the term &quot;color&quot; to refer to orchestration or harmony, critics have observed &quot;shades&quot; of a particular sound quality in his music.

in the popular standard You&#x27;re the Top by Cole Porter the painting is listed as &quot;You&#x27;re Whistler&#x27;s mama&quot;.

The subject of the painting is referenced as &quot;Mama Whistler&quot; in the lyrics of the Neil Diamond song Done Too Soon.

<text>The Domus Aurea (Latin, &quot;Golden House&quot;) was a vast landscaped complex built by the Emperor Nero largely on the Oppian Hill in the heart of ancient Rome after the great fire in 64 AD had destroyed a large part of the city.

It replaced and extended his Domus Transitoria that he had built as his first palace complex on the site.

==History==

Construction began after the great fire of 64 and was nearly completed before Nero&#x27;s death in 68, a remarkably short time for such an enormous project. Nero took great interest in every detail of the project, according to Tacitus, and oversaw the engineer-architects, Celer and Severus, who were also responsible for the attempted navigable canal with which Nero hoped to link Misenum with Lake Avernus.

Emperor Otho and possibly Titus allotted money to finish at least the structure on the Oppian Hill; this continued to be inhabited, notably by emperor Vitellius in 69 but only after falling ill, until it was destroyed in a fire under Trajan in 104.

A symbol of decadence that caused severe embarrassment to Nero&#x27;s successors, the Domus Aurea was stripped of its marble, jewels, and ivory within a decade. Although the Oppian villa continued to be inhabited for some years, soon after Nero&#x27;s death other parts of the palace and grounds, encompassing 2.6 km2 (c. 1 mi2), were filled with earth and built over: the Baths of Titus were already being built on part of the site, probably the private baths, in 79 AD. On the site of the lake, in the middle of the palace grounds, Vespasian built the Flavian Amphitheatre, which could be flooded at will, with the Colossus of Nero beside it. The Baths of Trajan, and the Temple of Venus and Roma were also built on the site. Within 40 years, the palace was obliterated. Paradoxically, this ensured the wall paintings&#x27; survival by protecting them from moisture.

===Rediscovery===

When a young Roman inadvertently fell through a cleft in the Esquiline hillside at the end of the 15th century, he found himself in a strange cave or grotto filled with painted figures. Soon the young artists of Rome were having themselves let down on boards knotted to ropes to see for themselves. The Fourth Style frescoes that were uncovered then have faded now, but the effect of these freshly rediscovered grotesque decorations () was electrifying in the early Renaissance, which was just arriving in Rome. 

When Raphael and Michelangelo crawled underground and were let down shafts to study them, the paintings were a revelation of the true world of antiquity. Beside the graffiti signatures of later tourists like Casanova and the Marquis de Sade scratched into a fresco inches apart, are the autographs of Domenico Ghirlandaio, Martin van Heemskerck, and Filippino Lippi.

Four of the frescos were removed in 1668; the only known surviving fresco of these is currently in the possession of the Ashmolean Museum (not currently on display).

The frescoes&#x27; effect on Renaissance artists was instant and profound (it can be seen most obviously in Raphael&#x27;s decoration for the loggias in the Vatican), and the white walls, delicate swags, and bands of frieze—framed reserves containing figures or landscapes—have returned at intervals ever since, notably in late 18th century Neoclassicism, making Famulus one of the most influential painters in the history of art.

===20th century to present===

Discovery of the pavilion led to the arrival of moisture starting the slow, inevitable process of decay; humidity sometimes reaches 90% inside the Domus. Heavy rain was blamed for the collapse of a chunk of ceiling. The presence of trees in the park above was causing further damage.

The weight of earth on the Domus was also causing a problem. Increasing concerns about the condition of the building resulted in its closing at the end of 2005 for further restoration work. The complex was partially reopened in 2007, but closed in 2008 because of safety concerns.

On March 30, 2010, of the vault of a gallery collapsed.

The Domus reopened in 2014.

==Construction==


Suetonius claims this of Nero and the Domus Aurea:
When the edifice was finished in this style and he dedicated it, he deigned to say nothing more in the way of approval than that he had at last begun to live like a human being.

The Domus Aurea complex covered parts of the slopes of the Palatine, Oppian, and Caelian hills, with an artificial lake in the marshy valley. The area of the estate can only be approximated, as much of it has not been excavated. Some scholars place it at more than , while others estimate its size to have been less than . Suetonius describes the complex as &quot;ruinously prodigal&quot; as it included groves of trees, pastures with flocks, vineyards, and an artificial lake—&quot;rus in urbe&quot;, &quot;countryside in the city&quot;.
Nero&#x27;s main residence remained the imperial palaces of the Palatine, while the pavilion on the Oppian was used when he preferred to remain in the &quot;horti&quot;, and the buildings with &quot;vestibulum&quot; and &quot;stagnum&quot; were used for feasts, where he received the people of Rome.

To supply his lake in the valley between the Palatine, Oppian, and Caelian, Nero diverted water from the Aqua Claudia by a specially built branch aqueduct known as the &quot;Arcus Neroniani&quot;. This extended 2 km west from the Claudia to the southern side of the Caelian Hill.

He also built a &quot;nymphaeum&quot; on the eastern side of the Caelian, visible across the valley from the pavilion, and against the eastern wall of the unfinished Temple of Claudius. The &quot;nymphaeum&quot; was made up of tiered columns and semicircular and rectangular niches; it would have contained a large sculptural group at the centre. Archaeological excavations confirm that the water cascaded from the top of the &quot;nymphaeum&quot; down into 4 basins. The aqueduct fed the nymphaeum and ultimately the lake.

Nero also commissioned from the Greek Zenodorus a colossal 35.5 m (120 RF) high bronze statue of him, the &quot;Colossus Neronis.&quot; Pliny the Elder, however, puts its height at only 30.3 m (106.5 RF). The statue was placed just outside the main palace entrance at the terminus of the Via Appia in a large atrium of porticoes that divided the city from the private villa. This statue may have represented Nero as the sun god Sol, as Pliny saw some resemblance. This idea is widely accepted among scholars, but some are convinced that Nero was not identified with Sol while he was alive. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero&#x27;s death during Vespasian’s reign to make it truly a statue of Sol. Hadrian moved it, with the help of the architect Decrianus and 24 elephants, to a position next to the Flavian Amphitheater. This building took the name &quot;Colosseum&quot; in the Middle Ages, after the statue nearby, or, as some historians believe, because of the sheer size of the building.

===Palace on the Palatine===

The main part of the palace was probably on the Palatine Hill and a large and brilliantly decorated set of rooms has been located in the central part of the hill under the Palace of Domitian. This site was excavated in 1721 when considerable damage was done during the excavations. The lower floors contained sunken gardens, two pavilions and an art gallery.

In one of these rooms is a rich marble floor found under the oval fountain room of Domitian&#x27;s Cenatio Iovis, and a rich nymphaeum with marble columns and bronze capitals. Today one corner of the nymphaeum has been rebuilt.

The cryptoporticus of Nero that connected the palace with the nearby Domus Tiberiana was also part of the complex. It is 130 m long with mosaic floors and elaborate stucco ceiling decoration with vegetal elements and cupids. It lies beneath the Horti Farnesiani along one side of the Domus Tiberiana.

The possible remains of Nero&#x27;s rotating banquet hall and its underlying mechanism were unveiled by archaeologists on September 29, 2009.

Today, one of the best-preserved parts of the palace is the block of 50 communal toilets which would have been used by slaves and workers in Nero&#x27;s time.

=== Pavilion on the Oppian Hill===


The Golden House building (pavilion) on the Oppian Hill (part of the Esquiline Hill) was extended from Nero&#x27;s earlier Domus Transitoria and designed mainly as a place of entertainment, as shown by the presence of 300 rooms with few sleeping quarters.

Rooms sheathed in dazzling polished white marble with paintings above had richly varied floor plans, complete with niches and exedras that concentrated or dispersed the daylight. There were pools in the floors and fountains splashing in the corridors.

The building plan is divided into two parts: the western one is simple and classic in design, characterised by perpendicular axes and built around a large rectangular courtyard, which opened towards the valley and the lake. The eastern part is of a much richer design with two of the principal dining rooms flanking an octagonal court, surmounted by a dome with a giant central oculus to let in light. It was an early use of Roman concrete construction.

It also had an upper floor on the same level as the hill against which it rested (to the north). The surviving parts of this floor are preserved only to a height of 30/60 cm, and the thickness of the walls was also reduced to 40/50 cm so that it was a much less monumental body than the lower floor.

During renovation works at the end of 2018, experts discovered a barrel-vaulted room (room 72) richly decorated with panthers, centaurs, the god Pan, and a sphinx, believed to have been built between 65 and 68 AD. The frescoes were of similar style to those in the cryptoporticus (room 92) which allows attribution to the so-called &quot;A&quot; workshop.
====The octagonal room====

The octagonal room was a masterpiece of Roman architecture and overlooked a &quot;xystus&quot; a track to watch gymnastic competitions, and the immense park. The lower part of the dome follows a pattern of octagonal segments (like Brunelleschi &#x27;s dome of S. Maria del Fiore in Florence), while the upper part assumes a circular shape.

This domed room was a &quot;triclinium&quot;, where the emperor manifested himself as divine, through the effects of light that the dome filtered, assimilating himself to the god Apollo. It was built on the model of the &quot;cenatio praecipua rotunda&quot; (dining room whose ceiling constantly revolved like the heavens) which Carandini and Fraioli position in the pavilion. The ceiling of the octagonal hall could probably rotate by means of a mechanism created by Celer and Severus and similar to a millstone which, hooked to the uncovered tracks along the edge of the central opening, was moved by slaves. Perfume was sprayed and rose petals were dropped on the assembled diners. According to some accounts, perhaps embellished by Nero&#x27;s political enemies, on one occasion such quantities of rose petals were dropped that one unlucky guest was asphyxiated (a similar story is told of the emperor Elagabalus).

On the sides of the octagonal room there were two apartments: the &quot;room of Achilles in Skyros&quot; and the &quot;room of Hector and Andromache&quot;, judged from their paintings. The side spaces served both as passageways and as buttress elements for the dome; These spaces were accessed through large openings surmounted by brick courses. This was probably one of the models from which the famous dome of the Pantheon drew inspiration: it is in fact an early example of the use of the cementitious technique, which had been developed by the Romans from the second century BC for the development of large and articulated interior spaces.

===Decoration===
The extensive gold leaf that gave the palace its name was not the only extravagant element of its decor: stuccoed ceilings were faced with semi-precious stones and ivory veneers, while the walls were frescoed, coordinating the decoration into different themes in each major group of rooms. Pliny the Elder watched it being built and mentions it in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;.

One innovation was destined to have an enormous influence on the art of the future: Nero placed mosaics, previously restricted to floors and gardens, in the vaulted ceilings. Only fragments have survived, but that technique was to be copied extensively, eventually ending up as a fundamental feature of Christian art: the apse mosaics that decorate so many churches in Rome, Ravenna, Sicily, and Constantinople.

Frescoes covered every surface that was not more richly finished. The main artist was Famulus (or Fabulus, or Amulius according to some sources). Fresco technique, working on damp plaster, demands a speedy and sure touch: Famulus and assistants from his studio covered a spectacular amount of wall area with frescoes. Pliny, in his &quot;Natural History&quot;, recounts how Famulus went for only a few hours each day to the Golden House, to work while the light was best. He wrote:More recently, lived Amulius, a grave and serious personage, but a painter in the florid style. By this artist there was a Minerva, which had the appearance of always looking at the spectators, from whatever point it was viewed. He only painted a few hours each day, and then with the greatest gravity, for he always kept the toga on, even when in the midst of his implements. The Golden Palace of Nero was the prison-house of this artist&#x27;s productions, and hence it is that there are so few of them to be seen elsewhere.

<text>Hester Street is a street in the Lower East Side of the New York City borough of Manhattan. It stretches from Essex Street to Centre Street, with a discontinuity between Chrystie Street and Forsyth Street for Sara Delano Roosevelt Park. There is also a discontinuity at Allen Street, which was created in 2009 with the rebuilding of the Allen Street Mall. At Centre Street, Hester Street shifts about to the north and is called Howard Street to its far western terminus at Mercer Street. 

Historically a center for Ashkenazi Jewish immigrant culture, more recently it has been absorbed by Chinatown, although some kosher and Jewish-owned stores remain. 

==History==

Hester Street was named after Hester Leisler, the daughter of Elsje Tymens and the insurrectionist Jacob Leisler, who was burned at the stake. Through her mother she was related to prominent Dutch families of the Hudson Valley, including the Bayards and the Van Cortlandts. She married Barent Rynders, Jr, a New York merchant, in 1696. She was the great-great-grandmother of Gouverneur Morris, a Founding Father of the United States.

In November 1851, the assistant board of aldermen of New York City voted in favor of removing a liberty pole at the junction of Hester Street and Division Street. The Franklin Building Association held its second regular monthly meeting at Washington Hall, on December 3, 1851. The building was located at the corner of Bowery. On April 15, 1912, an investigator reported that a parlor house on Hester Street had three &quot;inmates&quot; (prostitutes) who were waiting to entertain customers.

70 Hester Street was home to the First Roumanian-American Synagogue from 1881 to 1902, after which it moved a short distance to Rivington Street, where it remained until a 2006 fire.

As part of an experiment, in 1948, Hester Street was converted to a one-way eastbound street during the afternoon rush hour; it carried one-way westbound traffic at other times.

At the east end of Hester Street, an open-air market called the Hester Street Fair currently runs on weekends from April through October. The market is on a parcel of land owned by Seward Park Co-op and is run by MTV News Correspondent SuChin Pak, her brother Suhyun Pak, Adam Zeller, and Ron Castellano.

==In popular culture==
Hester Street is featured in Abraham Cahan&#x27;s 1896 novel &quot;&quot;, and is the title of the 1974 period film &quot;Hester Street&quot;, adapted from Cahan&#x27;s novel. 

The street is mentioned in the first stanza of Lola Ridge&#x27;s 1918 poem, &quot;The Ghetto&quot;:

Cool, inaccessible air&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Is floating in velvety blackness shot with steel-blue lights,&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;But no breath stirs the heat&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Leaning its ponderous bulk upon the Ghetto&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;And most on Hester street...

The first chapter of the 1925 novel &quot;Bread Givers&quot; by Jewish-American author Anzia Yezierska is called “Hester Street”. The novel tells the story of a young girl growing up in an immigrant Jewish household in the Lower East Side of New York City in the 1920s.

Al Stewart references Hester Street as part of the immigrant experience in his song &quot;Murmansk Run/Ellis Island&quot; on his 1980 album &quot;24 Carrots&quot;, in part as follows:&quot;Well you wake up in the morning on Hester Street and run to the factory, You can&#x27;t afford to be late&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Working every morning, every evening, every day for your money, Yet there&#x27;s nothing to save&quot;

==Notable people==
The sculptor Jacob Epstein was raised at 102 Hester Street.

<doc id="225524" wikidata="Q3141064" url="?curid=225524" title="Internationalization">
<text>In economics, internationalization or internationalisation is the process of increasing involvement of enterprises in international markets, although there is no agreed definition of internationalization. Internationalization is a crucial strategy not only for companies that seek horizontal integration globally but also for countries that addresses the sustainability of its development in different manufacturing as well as service sectors especially in higher education which is a very important context that needs internationalization to bridge the gap between different cultures and countries. There are several internationalization theories which try to explain why there are international activities.

== Entrepreneurs and enterprises ==
Those entrepreneurs who are interested in the field of internationalization of business need to possess the ability to think globally and have an understanding of international cultures. By appreciating and understanding different beliefs, values, behaviors and business strategies of a variety of companies within other countries, entrepreneurs will be able to internationalize successfully. Entrepreneurs must also have an ongoing concern for innovation, maintaining a high level of quality, be committed to corporate social responsibility, and continue to strive to provide the best business strategies and either goods or services possible while adapting to different countries and cultures.

== Trade theories ==

=== Absolute cost advantage ===

Adam Smith claimed that a country should specialise in, and export, commodities in which it had an absolute advantage. An absolute advantage existed when the country could produce a commodity with less costs per unit produced than could its trading partner. By the same reasoning, it should import commodities in which it had an absolute disadvantage.

While there are possible gains from trade with absolute advantage, comparative advantage extends the range of possible mutually beneficial exchanges. In other words, it is not necessary to have an absolute advantage to gain from trade, only a comparative advantage.

=== Comparative cost advantage ===

David Ricardo argued that a country does not need to have an absolute advantage in the production of any commodity for international trade between it and another country to be mutually beneficial. Absolute advantage meant greater efficiency in production, or the use of less labor factor in production. Two countries could both benefit from trade if each had a relative advantage in production. Relative advantage simply meant that the ratio of the labor embodied in the two commodities differed between two countries, such that each country would have at least one commodity where the relative amount of labor embodied would be less than that of the other country.

=== Gravity model of trade ===

The gravity model of trade in international economics, similar to other gravity models in social science, predicts bilateral trade flows based on the economic sizes of (often using GDP measurements) and distance between two units. The basic theoretical model for trade between two countries takes the form of:

:formula_1

with:

:formula_2: Trade flow

:formula_3: Country i and j

:formula_4: Economic mass, for example GDP

:formula_5: Distance

:formula_6: Constant

The model has also been used in international relations to evaluate the impact of treaties and alliances on trade, and it has been used to test the effectiveness of trade agreements and organizations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

=== Heckscher–Ohlin model ===

The Heckscher–Ohlin model (H–O model), also known as the &quot;factors proportions development&quot;, is a general equilibrium mathematical model of international trade, developed by Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin at the Stockholm School of Economics. It builds on David Ricardo&#x27;s theory of comparative advantage by predicting patterns of commerce and production based on the factor endowments of a trading region. The model essentially says that countries will export products that utilize their abundant and cheap of production and import products that utilize the countries&#x27; scarce .

The results of this work have been the formulation of certain named conclusions arising from the assumptions inherent in the model. These are known as:

* Heckscher–Ohlin theorem
* Rybczynski theorem
* Stolper–Samuelson theorem
* Factor-Price Equalization theorem

=== Leontief paradox ===

Leontief&#x27;s paradox in economics is that the country with the world&#x27;s highest capital-per worker has a &quot;lower&quot; capital:labour ratio in exports than in imports.

This econometric find was the result of Professor Wassily W. Leontief&#x27;s attempt to test the Heckscher-Ohlin theory empirically. In 1954, Leontief found that the U.S. (the most capital-abundant country in the world by any criteria) exported labor-intensive commodities and imported capital-intensive commodities, in contradiction with Heckscher-Ohlin theory.

=== Linder hypothesis ===

The Linder hypothesis (demand-structure hypothesis) is a conjecture in economics about international trade patterns. The hypothesis is that the more similar are the demand structures of countries the more they will trade with one another. Further, international trade will still occur between two countries having identical preferences and factor endowments (relying on specialization to create a comparative advantage in the production of differentiated goods between the two nations).

=== Location theory ===

Location theory is concerned with the geographic location of economic activity; it has become an integral part of economic geography, regional science, and spatial economics. Location theory addresses the questions of what economic activities are located where and why. Location theory rests — like microeconomic theory generally — on the assumption that agents act in their own self-interest. Thus firms choose locations that maximize their profits and individuals choose locations, that maximize their utility.

=== Market imperfection theory ===

In economics, a market failure is a situation wherein the allocation of production or use of goods and services by the free market is not efficient. Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals&#x27; pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that can be improved upon from the societal point of view. The first known use of the term by economists was in 1958, but the concept has been traced back to the Victorian philosopher Henry Sidgwick.

Market imperfection can be defined as anything that interferes with trade. This includes two dimensions of imperfections. First, imperfections cause a rational market participant to deviate from holding the market portfolio. Second, imperfections cause a rational market participant to deviate from his preferred risk level. Market imperfections generate costs which interfere with trades that rational individuals make (or would make in the absence of the imperfection).

The idea that multinational corporations (MNEs) owe their existence to market imperfections was first put forward by Stephen Hymer, Charles P. Kindleberger and Caves. The market imperfections they had in mind were, however, &quot;structural&quot; imperfections in markets for final products.

According to Hymer, market imperfections are structural, arising from structural deviations from perfect competition in the final product market due to exclusive and permanent control of proprietary technology, privileged access to inputs, scale economies, control of distribution systems, and product differentiation, but in their absence markets are perfectly efficient.

By contrast, the insight of transaction costs theories of the MNEs, simultaneously and independently developed in the 1970s by McManus (1972), Buckley and Casson (1976), Brown (1976) and Hennart (1977, 1982), is that &quot;market imperfections&quot; are inherent attributes of markets, and MNEs are institutions to bypass these imperfections. Markets experience natural imperfections, i.e. imperfections that are because the implicit neoclassical assumptions of perfect knowledge and perfect enforcement are not realized.

=== New Trade Theory ===

New Trade Theory (NTT) is the economic critique of international free trade from the perspective of increasing returns to scale and the network effect. Some economists have asked whether it might be effective for a nation to shelter infant industries until they had grown to a sufficient size large enough to compete internationally.

New Trade theorists challenge the assumption of diminishing returns to scale, and some argue that using protectionist measures to build up a huge industrial base in certain industries will then allow those sectors to dominate the world market (via a network effect).

=== Specific factors model ===

In this model, labour mobility between industries is possible while capital is immobile between industries in the short-run. Thus, this model can be interpreted as a &#x27;short run&#x27; version of the Heckscher-Ohlin model.

== Traditional approaches ==
=== Diamond model ===

The diamond model is an economical model developed by Michael Porter in his book &quot;The Competitive Advantage of Nations&quot;, where he published his theory of why particular industries become competitive in particular locations.

The diamond model consists of six factors:

* Factor conditions
* Demand conditions
* Related and supporting industries
* Firm strategy, structure and rivalry
* Government
* Chance

The Porter thesis is that these factors interact with each other to create conditions where innovation and improved competitiveness occurs.

=== Diffusion of innovations ===

Diffusion of innovation is a theory of how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technology spread through cultures. Everett Rogers introduced it in his 1962 book, &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot;, writing that &quot;Diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.&quot;

=== Eclectic paradigm ===

The eclectic paradigm is a theory in economics and is also known as the OLI-Model. It is a further development of the theory of internalization and published by John H. Dunning in 1993. The theory of internalization itself is based on the transaction cost theory. This theory says that transactions are made within an institution if the transaction costs on the free market are higher than the internal costs. This process is called &quot;internalization&quot;.

For Dunning, not only the structure of organization is important. He added three additional factors to the theory:

* Ownership advantages (trademark, production technique, entrepreneurial skills, returns to scale)
* Locational advantages (existence of raw materials, low wages, special taxes or tariffs)
* Internalisation advantages (advantages by producing through a partnership arrangement such as licensing or a joint venture)

=== Foreign direct investment theory ===

Foreign direct investment (FDI) in its classic form is defined as a company from one country making a physical investment into building a factory in another country. It is the establishment of an enterprise by a foreigner. Its definition can be extended to include investments made to acquire lasting interest in enterprises operating outside of the economy of the investor. The FDI relationship consists of a parent enterprise and a foreign affiliate which together form a multinational corporation (MNC). In order to qualify as FDI the investment must afford the parent enterprise &quot;control&quot; over its foreign affiliate. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) defines control in this case as owning 10% or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an incorporated firm or its equivalent for an unincorporated firm; lower ownership shares are known as portfolio investment.

=== Monopolistic advantage theory ===

The monopolistic advantage theory is an approach in international business which explains why firms can compete in foreign settings against indigenous competitors and is frequently associated with the seminal contribution of Stephen Hymer.

Prior to Stephen Hymer’s doctoral thesis, The International Operations of National Firms: A Study of foreign direct Investment, theories did not adequately explain why firms engaged in foreign operations.
Hymer started his research by analyzing the motivations behind foreign investment of US corporations in other countries. Neoclassical theories, dominant at the time, explained foreign direct investments as capital movements across borders based on perceived benefits from interest rates in other markets, there was no need to separate them from any other kind of investment (Ietto-Guilles, 2012).
He effectively differentiated Foreign Direct Investment and portfolio investments by including the notion of control of foreign firms to FDI Theory, which implies control of the operation; whilst portfolio foreign investment confers a share of ownership but not control. Stephen Hymer focused on and considered FDI and MNE as part of the theory of the firm. (Hymer, 1976: 21)
He also dismissed the assumption that FDIs are motivated by the search of low costs in foreign countries, by emphasizing the fact that local firms are not able to compete effectively against foreign firms, even though they have to face foreign barriers (cultural, political, lingual etc.) to market entry. He suggested that firms invest in foreign countries in order to maximize their specific firm advantages in imperfect markets, that is, markets where the flow of information is uneven and allows companies to benefit from a competitive advantage over the local competition.
Stephen Hymer also suggested a second determinant for firms engaging in foreign operations, removal of conflicts. When a rival company is operating in a foreign market or is willing to enter one, a conflict situation arises. Through FDI, a multinational can share or take complete control of foreign production, effectively removing conflict. This will lead to the increase of market power for the specific firm, increasing imperfections in the market as a whole (Ietto-Guilles, 2012)
A final determinant for multinationals making direct investments is the distribution of risk through diversification. By choosing different markets and production locations, the risk inherent to foreign operations are spread and reduced.
All of these motivations for FDI are built on market imperfections and conflict. A firm engaging in direct investment could then reduce competition, eliminate the conflicts and exploit the firm specific advantages making them capable of succeeding in a foreign market.
Stephen Hymer can be considered the father of international business because he effectively studied multinationals from a different perspective than the existing literature, by approaching multinationals as national companies with international operations, regarded as expansions from home operations. He analyzed the activities of the MNEs and their impact on the economy, gave an explanation for the large flow of foreign investments by US corporations at a time where they were incomplete, and envisioned the ethical conflicts that could arise from the increase in power of MNEs.

=== Non-availability approach ===

The non-availability explains international trade by the fact that each country imports the goods that are not available at home. This unavailability may be due to lack of natural resources (oil, gold, etc.: this is &quot;absolute&quot; unavailability) or to the fact that the goods cannot be produced domestically, or could only be produced at prohibitive costs (for technological or other reasons): this is &quot;relative&quot; unavailability. On the other hand, each country exports the goods that are available at home.

=== Technology gap theory of trade ===

The technology gap theory describes an advantage enjoyed by the country that introduces new goods in a market. As a consequence of research activity and entrepreneurship, new goods are produced and the innovating country enjoys a monopoly until the other countries learn to produce these goods: in the meantime they have to import them. Thus, international trade is created for the time necessary to imitate the new goods (&quot;imitation lag&quot;).

=== Uppsala model ===

The Uppsala model is a theory that explains how firms gradually intensify their activities in foreign markets. It is similar to the POM model. The key features of both models are the following: firms first gain experience from the domestic market before they move to foreign markets; firms start their foreign operations from culturally and/or geographically close countries and move gradually to culturally and geographically more distant countries; firms start their foreign operations by using traditional exports and gradually move to using more intensive and demanding operation modes (sales subsidiaries etc.) both at the company and target country level.

=== Updated Uppsala model ===

The Updated Uppsala model is a further progression of the original Uppsala model. Like the Uppsala model, the Updated Uppsala model is a theory that explains firm internationalization as a process of gradual commitment. However, instead of an increased commitment to other markets, the theory posits that firms commit to business networks. Firms thereby utilize the established relationships with other firms to internationalize within their network, e.g. by localizing production at a foreign production site of the client.

=== Learning portal model ===
The Learning Portal Model is a new theory that was originally developed to explain the emergence and catch-up of multinational firms from the emerging markets. The theory explains that latecomer firms (from both, advanced and emerging markets) can use springboarding strategies to leapfrog certain technological development stages and accelerate their catch‐up with incumbent leading firms in their industry. To do so, the catching-up firms establish learning portals in knowledge hubs to acquire knowledge and assets, which they exploit to compete in global markets.

== Further theories ==

=== Contingency theory ===

Contingency theory refers to any of a number of management theories. Several contingency approaches were developed concurrently in the late 1960s. They suggested that previous theories such as Weber&#x27;s bureaucracy and Frederick Winslow Taylor&#x27;s scientific management had failed because they neglected that management style and organizational structure were influenced by various aspects of the environment: the contingency factors. There could not be &quot;one best way&quot; for leadership or organization.

=== Contract theory ===

In economics, contract theory studies how economic actors can and do construct contractual arrangements, generally in the presence of asymmetric information. Contract theory is closely connected to the field of law and economics. One prominent field of application is managerial compensation.

=== Economy of scale ===

Economies of scale, in microeconomics, are the cost advantages that a business obtains due to expansion. They are factors that cause a producer’s average cost per unit to fall as output rises. Diseconomies of scale are the opposite. Economies of scale may be utilized by any size firm expanding its scale of operation.

=== Internalisation theory ===
=== Product life-cycle theory ===

As first articulated by Raymond Vernon in 1966, a product goes through a life cycle consisting of four stages: &quot;new product&quot;, &quot;growth product&quot;, &quot;maturity product&quot; and &quot;obsolescence product&quot;. The conditions in which a product is sold change over time and must be managed as it moves through this succession of stages. This is called product life cycle management. 

=== Transaction cost theory ===

The theory of the firm consists of a number of economic theories which describe the nature of the firm, company, or corporation, including its existence, its behaviour, and its relationship with the market.

Ronald Coase set out his transaction cost theory of the firm in 1937, making it one of the first (neo-classical) attempts to define the firm theoretically in relation to the market. Coase sets out to define a firm in a manner which is both realistic and compatible with the idea of substitution at the margin, so instruments of conventional economic analysis apply. He notes that a firm’s interactions with the market may not be under its control (for instance because of sales taxes), but its internal allocation of resources are: “Within a firm, ... market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the entrepreneur ... who directs production.” He asks why alternative methods of production (such as the price mechanism and economic planning), could not either achieve all production, so that either firms use internal prices for all their production, or one big firm runs the entire economy. 

=== Theory of the growth of the firm ===

While at Johns Hopkins, Penrose participated in a research project on the growth of firms. She came to the conclusion that the existing theory of the firm was inadequate to explain how firms grow. Her insight was to realise that the &#x27;Firm&#x27; in theory is not the same thing as &#x27;flesh and blood&#x27; organizations that businessmen call firms. This insight eventually led to the publication of her second book, &quot;The Theory of the Growth of the Firm&quot; in 1959.

<text>Marie-Christine Barrault (born 21 March 1944) is a French actress. She is best known for her performance in &quot;Cousin Cousine&quot; (1975) for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 2010, she released her autobiography, titled &quot;This Long Way to Get to You&quot;.

==Life and career==
Marie-Christine Barrault was born in Paris, France, the daughter of Martha (née Valmier) and Max-Henri Barrault. Her parents later divorced. Barrault&#x27;s father, who worked in the theatre, died while she was a teenager. With no support, her mother was unable to care for her and her brother, Alain. Barrault was raised by her grandmother, Felicite. She was mentored in acting by her aunt and uncle, French performers Jean-Louis Barrault and Madeleine Renaud. They initially did not support her dreams of becoming an actress. She performed in plays in secondary school and then enrolled in an acting conservatory. 

Barrault got her start on television in &quot;L&#x27;oeuvre&quot; (1967). She made her feature film debut in Éric Rohmer&#x27;s &quot;My Night at Maud&#x27;s&quot; (1969). In 1970 Barrault was featured along with Pierre Richard in the comedy film &quot;Le Distrait&quot;. In 1975 Barrault starred in &quot;Cousin Cousine&quot;, for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She worked with Rohmer once again in 1978, in the role of Guinevere in &quot;Perceval le Gallois&quot; and she also has a cameo in his &quot;Chloe in the Afternoon&quot;.

Barrault is not fluent in English and therefore has generally turned down offers to appear in English-language films. However, in 1980 she accepted an offer from Woody Allen to appear in his film &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;. In 1988 she was nominated for a Genie Award for her performance in &quot;No Blame&quot;. In 1991 she portrayed Marie Curie in a television mini-series. In her later career, she has preferred acting on the stage in France. In 2015, she came to Los Angeles on tour to perform in the play &quot;Les Yeux Ouverts&quot;, in which she portrays French author Marguerite Yourcenar.

Barrault&#x27;s first husband was producer Daniel Toscan du Plantier, whom she married in 1965. With him, she had two children, David and Ariane. Barrault was married to director Roger Vadim from 1990 until his death from cancer in 2000. She herself is a breast cancer survivor.

<doc id="225534" wikidata="Q3274942" url="?curid=225534" title="Languages of East Asia">
<text>The languages of [[East Asia]] belong to several distinct language families, with many common features attributed to interaction. In the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, Chinese varieties and languages of southeast Asia share many areal features, tending to be analytic languages with similar syllable and tone structure. In the 1st millennium AD, Chinese culture came to dominate East Asia, and Classical Chinese was adopted by scholars and ruling classes in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. As a consequence, there was a massive influx of loanwords from Chinese vocabulary into these and other neighboring Asian languages. The Chinese script was also adapted to write Vietnamese (as Chữ Nôm), Korean (as Hanja) and Japanese (as Kanji), though in the first two the use of Chinese characters is now restricted to university learning, linguistic or historical study, artistic or decorative works and (in Korean&#x27;s case) newspapers, rather than daily usage.

== Language families ==

The Austroasiatic languages include Vietnamese and Khmer, as well as many other languages spoken in areas scattered as far afield as Malaya (Aslian) and central India (Korku), often in isolated pockets surrounded by the ranges of other language groups. Most linguists believe that Austroasiatic languages once ranged continuously across southeast Asia and that their scattered distribution today is the result of the subsequent arrival of other language groups.

One of these groups were the Tai–Kadai languages such as Thai, Lao and Shan. These languages were originally spoken in southern China, where the greatest diversity within the family is still found, and possibly as far north as the Yangtze valley. As Chinese civilization expanded southward from the North China Plain, many Tai–Kadai speakers became sinicized, while others were displaced to Southeast Asia. With the exception of Zhuang, most of the Tai–Kadai languages still remaining in China are spoken in isolated upland areas.

The Miao–Yao or Hmong–Mien languages also originated in southern China, where they are now spoken only in isolated hill regions. Many Hmong–Mien speakers were displaced into Southeast Asia during the Qing Dynasty in the 18th and 19th centuries, triggered by the suppression of a series of revolts in Guizhou.

The Austronesian languages are believed to have spread from Taiwan to the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, as well as some areas of mainland southeast Asia.

The varieties of Chinese are usually included in the Sino-Tibetan family, which also includes Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in Tibet, southwest China, northeast India, Burma and neighbouring countries.

To the north are the Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic language families, which some linguists had grouped as an Altaic family, sometimes also including the Korean and Japonic languages, but is now seen as a discredited theory and is no longer supported by specialists in these languages. The languages tend to be atonal, polysyllabic and agglutinative, with subject–object–verb word order and some degree of vowel harmony. Critics of the Altaic hypothesis attribute the similarities to intense language contact between the languages that occurred sometime in pre-history.

Chinese scholars often group Tai–Kadai and Hmong–Mien with Sino-Tibetan, but Western scholarship since the Second World War has considered them as separate families. Some larger groupings have been proposed, but are not widely supported. The Austric hypothesis, based on morphology and other resemblances, is that Austroasiatic, Austronesian, often Tai–Kadai, and sometimes Hmong–Mien form a genetic family. Other hypothetical groupings include the Sino-Austronesian languages and Austro-Tai languages. Linguists undergoing long-range comparison have hypothesized even larger macrofamilies such as Dené–Caucasian, including Sino-Tibetan and Ket.

== Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area ==

The Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area stretches from Thailand to China and is home to speakers of languages of the Sino-Tibetan, Hmong–Mien (or Miao–Yao), Tai-Kadai, Austronesian (represented by Chamic) and Austroasiatic families. Neighbouring languages across these families, though presumed unrelated, often have similar typological features, which are believed to have spread by diffusion.

Characteristic of many MSEA languages is a particular syllable structure involving monosyllabic morphemes, lexical tone, a fairly large inventory of consonants, including phonemic aspiration, limited clusters at the beginning of a syllable, plentiful vowel contrasts and relatively few final consonants. Languages in the northern part of the area generally have fewer vowel and final contrasts but more initial contrasts.

A well-known feature is the similar tone systems in Chinese, Hmong–Mien, Tai languages and Vietnamese. Most of these languages passed through an earlier stage with three tones on most syllables (apart from checked syllables ending in a stop consonant), which was followed by a tone split where the distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants disappeared but in compensation the number of tones doubled.
These parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages, until Haudricourt showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature, by demonstrating that Vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the Mon–Khmer family, and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin.

MSEA languages tend to have monosyllabic morphemes, though there are exceptions. Most MSEA languages are very analytic, with no inflection and little derivational morphology. Grammatical relations are typically signalled by word order, particles and coverbs or adpositions. Modality is expressed using sentence-final particles. The usual word order in MSEA languages is subject–verb–object. Chinese and Karen are thought to have changed to this order from the subject–object–verb order retained by most other Sino-Tibetan languages.
The order of constituents within a noun phrase varies: noun–modifier order is usual in Tai languages, Vietnamese and Miao, while in Chinese varieties and Yao most modifiers are placed before the noun. Topic-comment organization is also common.

Languages of both eastern and southeast Asia typically have well-developed systems of numeral classifiers. The other areas of the world where numerical classifier systems are common in indigenous languages are the western parts of North and South America, so that numerical classifiers could even be seen as a pan-Pacific Rim areal feature. However, similar noun class systems are also found among most Sub-Saharan African languages.

== Influence of Literary Chinese ==

For most of the pre-modern period, Chinese culture dominated East Asia. Scholars in Vietnam, Korea and Japan wrote in Literary Chinese and were thoroughly familiar with the Chinese classics. Their languages absorbed large numbers of Chinese words, known collectively as Sino-Xenic vocabulary, i.e. Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean and Sino-Vietnamese. These words were written with Chinese characters and pronounced in a local approximation of Middle Chinese.

Today, these words of Chinese origin may be written in the traditional Chinese characters (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), simplified Chinese characters (Chinese, Japanese), a locally developed phonetic script (Korean hangul, Japanese kana), or a Latin alphabet (Vietnamese). The Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages are collectively referred to as CJKV, or just CJK, since modern Vietnamese is no longer written with Chinese characters at all.

In a similar way to the use of Latin and ancient Greek roots in English, the morphemes of Classical Chinese have been used extensively in all these languages to coin compound words for new concepts. These coinages, written in shared Chinese characters, have then been borrowed freely between languages. They have even been accepted into Chinese, a language usually resistant to loanwords, because their foreign origin was hidden by their written form.

=== Topic–comment constructions ===
In topic–comment constructions, sentences are frequently structured with a topic as the first segment and a comment as the second. This way of marking previously mentioned vs. newly introduced information is an alternative to articles, which are not found in East Asian languages. The Topic–comment sentence structure is a legacy of Classical Chinese influence on the grammar of modern East Asian languages. In Classical Chinese, the focus of the phrase (i.e. the topic) was often placed first, which was then followed by a statement about the topic. The most generic sentence form in Classical Chinese is &quot;A B 也&quot;, where &quot;B&quot; is a comment about the topic &quot;A&quot;.

==Politeness systems==

Linguistic systems of politeness, including frequent use of honorific titles, with varying levels of politeness or respect, are well-developed in Japanese and Korean. Politeness systems in Chinese are relatively weak, having simplified from a more developed system into a much less predominant role in modern Chinese. This is especially true when speaking of the southern Chinese varieties. However, Vietnamese has retained a highly complex system of pronouns, in which the terms mostly derive from Chinese. For example, &quot;bác&quot;, &quot;chú&quot;, &quot;dượng&quot;, and &quot;cậu&quot; are all terms ultimately derived from Chinese and all refer to different statuses of &quot;uncle&quot;.

In many of the region&#x27;s languages, including Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Malay/Indonesian, new personal pronouns or forms of reference or address can and often do evolve from nouns as fresh ways of expressing respect or social status. Thus personal pronouns are open class words rather than closed class words: they are not stable over time, not few in number, and not clitics whose use is obligatory in grammatical constructs. In addition to Korean honorifics that indicate politeness toward the subject of the speech, Korean speech levels indicate a level of politeness and familiarity directed toward the audience.

With modernization and other trends, politeness language is evolving to be simpler. Avoiding the need for complex polite language can also motivate use in some situations of languages like Indonesian or English that have less complex respect systems.

<text>Cousin Cousine is a 1975 French romantic comedy film directed by Jean-Charles Tacchella and starring Marie-Christine Barrault, Victor Lanoux, Marie-France Pisier, Guy Marchand and Ginette Garcin. Written by Tacchella and Danièle Thompson, the film is about two cousins by marriage who meet at a wedding and develop a close friendship. After their spouses prove unfaithful, the cousins&#x27; friendship leads to a passionate love affair.

&quot;Cousin Cousine&quot; received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, a César Award nomination for Best Film and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and was selected by the National Board of Review Award as one of the Top Five Foreign Films of 1976. An English-language remake, &quot;Cousins&quot;, was released in 1989.

==Plot==
Two cousins related by marriage, Marthe and Ludovic, meet at a family wedding for the first time. Marthe is the bride&#x27;s daughter, and Ludovic is the groom&#x27;s nephew. After a raucous wedding reception with plenty of dancing and drinking, Marthe and Ludovic are left waiting for their respective spouses, Pascal and Karine, who are off having sex. While they wait, they get to know each other: Marthe is a secretary, and Ludovic is a dance instructor who changes his occupation every three years. They later dance together. Eventually, Pascal and Karine show up, slightly disheveled, and the couples part.

Ludovic meets Marthe for lunch and tells her that her husband is having an affair with his wife. Later, Pascal informs her that he has broken off all of his affairs and that, from now on, she will be the only one. When Marthe tells him she knows about Karine, he says he only had her &quot;three times in the bushes&quot;.

Some time later at a family gathering at Marthe&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house, Ludovic&#x27;s teenage daughter, Nelsa, shows slides she took at the wedding—including compromising photos of Pascal and Karine. During the slideshow, Marthe&#x27;s mother&#x27;s new husband dies. At the funeral, Ludovic&#x27;s father arrives and extends his condolences; he too lost his spouse recently. On the way back from the cemetery, Marthe and Ludovic become better acquainted, with Marthe revealing that she enjoys swimming and singing.

Later that week, Marthe and Ludovic meet for lunch, buy bathing suits, and go swimming in a public pool. They enjoy each other&#x27;s company so much that they decide to take the rest of the day off together to go shopping and see a film. Although their relationship is platonic, Pascal and Karine begin to grow jealous. Marthe and Ludovic playfully arrange to meet by chance at a restaurant with their respective families, to see how Pascal and Karine react. Later that week, Marthe and Ludovic meet again at the swimming pool and acknowledge that their relationship is special and must remain that way, even if platonic.

At another family wedding, with Pascal and the groom&#x27;s father fighting over a business deal gone wrong, Marthe and Ludovic decide to leave and spend the day together. They return to find a drunken Pascal harassing the guests, and soon they all leave the disastrous wedding and bring Pascal home. Marthe&#x27;s mother and Ludovic&#x27;s father develop a close friendship and plan to spend time at his vineyard. Marthe and Ludovic discuss their own relationship and decide that it is absurd to keep it platonic. For once, they will do something for themselves, and not for their spouses and families.

That Saturday, Marthe and Ludovic meet and spend the day together having sex. The following morning, they extend their stay another day, having sex, exchanging recipes, and bathing together.

In the coming days, Pascal reverts to his philandering ways, Karine leaves Ludovic and then returns, and Marthe&#x27;s mother and Ludovic&#x27;s father discover they are not as compatible as they thought. Marthe and Ludovic&#x27;s relationship, however, continues to grow. At a Christmas family gathering at Marthe&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house, Marthe and Ludovic lock themselves in a bedroom and have sex throughout the evening while their families eat, drink, watch Midnight Mass, and exchange gifts. The couple finally emerges from the bedroom, says goodbye to their families, and rides off into the night together.

<doc id="225536" wikidata="Q1247736" url="?curid=225536" title="Ann Veronica">
<text>Ann Veronica is a New Woman novel by H. G. Wells published in 1909. It describes the rebellion of Ann Veronica Stanley, a 21-year-old woman , against her middle-class father&#x27;s stern patriarchal rule. The novel dramatizes the contemporary problem of the New Woman. It is set in Edwardian era London and environs, except for an Alpine excursion. &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; offers vignettes of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in Great Britain and features a chapter inspired by the 1908 attempt of suffragettes to storm Parliament.

==Plot==

Mr. Stanley forbids his adult daughter, a biology student at Tredgold Women&#x27;s College and the youngest of his five children, to attend a fancy dress ball in London, causing a crisis. Ann Veronica is planning to attend the dance with friends of a down-at-heel artistic family living nearby and has been chafing at other restrictions imposed on her for no apparent reason. After her father resorts to force to stop her from attending the ball, she leaves her home in the fictional south London suburb of Morningside Park in order to live independently in an apartment &quot;in a street near the Hampstead Road&quot; in North London. Unable to find appropriate employment, she borrows forty pounds from Mr. Ramage, an older man, without realizing she is compromising herself.

With this money, Ann Veronica is able to devote herself to study in the biological laboratory of the Central Imperial College (a constituent college of London University) where she meets and falls in love with Capes, the laboratory&#x27;s &quot;demonstrator.&quot; But Mr. Ramage loses little time in trying to take advantage of the situation, precipitating a crisis. Distraught after Ramage tries to force himself on her, Ann Veronica temporarily abandons her studies and devotes herself to the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage; she is arrested storming Parliament and spends a month in prison.

Sobered by the experience, Ann Veronica convinces herself of the necessity of compromise. She returns to her father&#x27;s home and engages herself to marry an admirer she does not love, Hubert Manning. But she soon changes her mind, renounces the engagement, and boldly tells Capes she loves him.

Though he returns Ann Veronica&#x27;s love, at first the thirty-year-old Capes insists on the impossibility of the situation: he is a married (albeit separated) man with a sullied reputation because of an affair that became public. They can only be friends, he declares. But Ann Veronica is undeterred by his confession and his prudence, and finally Capes&#x27;s resistance buckles: &quot;She stood up and held her arms toward him. &#x27;I want you to kiss me,&#x27; she said. . . . &#x27;I want you. I want you to be my lover. I want to give myself to you. I want to be whatever I can to you.&#x27; She paused for a moment. &#x27;Is that plain?&#x27; she asked.&quot;

Capes decides to throw over his employment at the college in order to live with Ann Veronica, and they enjoy a glorious &quot;honeymoon&quot; in the Alps. A final chapter shows the happy couple four years and four months later living in London. Capes has become a successful playwright, and Ann Veronica is pregnant and has reconciled with her family.

==Reception==

&quot;Ann Veronica&quot; created a sensation when published in the autumn of 1909 because of the feminist sensibilities of the heroine and also because of the affair Wells was having with Amber Reeves, the woman who inspired the novel&#x27;s eponymous character.

Although the novel now seems very tame, &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; was considered a scandalous work by many in its day and was denounced as &quot;capable of poisoning the minds of those who read it&quot; by &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

&quot;Ann Veronica&quot; was included in the Modern Library in 1917, the year the publishing company was founded. Subsequent Modern Library editions were published in 1926, 1928, and 1933.

&quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; published in 1930 a review by Frederick P. Mayer, in which he compared &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; to Maxim Gorky&#x27;s novel &quot;Bystander&quot;, and wrote that &quot;&quot;Ann Veronica&quot; is the type outline, not the individual story, of a young woman rebel... [Wells] preach[es] sermons, and ... debate[s]. But [he] ha[s] no artistic community with the novelist as an artist&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Television===
It was filmed for television in 1952 with Margaret Lockwood in the title role. In 1964 it was adapted again by the BBC as a four-part series &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; starring Rosemary Nicols.

===Musical===
&quot;Ann Veronica&quot; was made into a musical in 1969; both the musical and one of the numbers within are titled &quot;Ann Veronica&quot;.

===Radio===
The book was recorded for BBC Radio 4 in two episodes, with Amy Hoggart as Ann Veronica and Geoffrey Whitehead playing Mr Stanley. It was broadcast again on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 5 and 6 January 2021.

<doc id="225537" wikidata="Q3940786" url="?curid=225537" title="Scientific romance">
<text>Scientific romance is an archaic, mainly British term for the genre of fiction now commonly known as science fiction. The term originated in the 1850s to describe both fiction and elements of scientific writing, but it has since come to refer to the science fiction of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, primarily that of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Arthur Conan Doyle. In recent years the term has come to be applied to science fiction written in a deliberately anachronistic style as a homage to or pastiche of the original scientific romances.

==History==

===Early usages===
The earliest use of the term &quot;scientific romance&quot; is thought to have been in 1845, when critics applied it to Robert Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;, a speculative natural history published in 1844. It was used again in 1851 by the &quot;Edinburgh Ecclesiastical Journal and Literary Review&quot; in reference to Thoman Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Panthea, or the Spirit of Nature&quot;. In 1859 the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; referred to Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Ursule Mirouët&quot; as &quot;a scientific romance of mesmerism&quot;. In addition, the term was sometimes used to dismiss a scientific principle considered by the writer to be fanciful, as in &quot;The Principles of Metaphysical and Ethical Science&quot; (1855), which stated that &quot;Milton&#x27;s conception of inorganic matter left to itself, without an indwelling soul, is not merely more poetical, but more philosophical and just, than the scientific romance, now generally repudiated by all rational inquirers, which represents it as necessarily imbued with the seminal principles of organization and life, and waking up by its own force from eternal quietude to eternal motion.&quot; Then, in 1884, Charles Howard Hinton published a series of scientific and philosophical essays under the title &quot;Scientific Romances&quot;.

===20th century===
&quot;Scientific romance&quot; is now commonly used to refer to science fiction of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as in the anthologies &quot;Under the Moons of Mars: A History and Anthology of &quot;The Scientific Romance&quot; in the Munsey Magazines, 1912–1920&quot; and &quot;Scientific Romance in Britain: 1890–1950&quot;. One of the earliest writers to be described in this way was the French astronomer and writer Camille Flammarion, whose &quot;Recits de l&#x27;infini&quot; and &quot;La fin du monde&quot; have both been described as scientific romances. The term is most widely applied to Jules Verne, as in the 1879 edition of the &quot;American Cyclopædia&quot;, and H. G. Wells, whose historical society continues to refer to his work as &quot;scientific romances&quot; today. Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; (1912) is also sometimes seen as a major work of scientific romance, and Sam Moskowitz referred to him in 1958 as &quot;the acknowledged master of the scientific romance,&quot; though the scholar E. F. Bleiler views Burroughs as a writer involved in the &quot;new development&quot; of pulp science fiction that arose in the early 20th century. The same year as &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle published &quot;The Lost World&quot;, which is also commonly referred to as a scientific romance.

1902 saw the cinematic release of Georges Méliès&#x27;s film &quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune&quot; (&quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;); the time period and the fact that it is based partially on works by Verne and Wells has led to its being labelled as a scientific romance as well.

===Modern revival===
In recent years the term &quot;scientific romance&quot; has seen a revival, being self-applied in works of science fiction that deliberately ape previous styles. Examples include Christopher Priest&#x27;s &quot;The Space Machine: A Scientific Romance&quot;, published in 1976, Ronald Wright&#x27;s Wells pastiche &quot;A Scientific Romance: A Novel&quot;, published in 1998, and the 1993 tabletop roleplaying game &quot;Forgotten Futures.&quot; Though it uses the term, Dennis Overbye&#x27;s novel &quot;Einstein in Love: A Scientific Romance&quot; does not imitate science fiction of the past in the manner of the other novels mentioned.

==Definitions==

Brian Stableford has argued, in &quot;Scientific Romance in Britain: 1890–1950&quot;, that early British science-fiction writers who used the term &quot;scientific romance&quot; differed in several significant ways from American science fiction writers of the time. Most notably, the British writers tended to minimise the role of individual &quot;heroes&quot;, took an &quot;evolutionary perspective&quot;, held a bleak view of the future, and had little interest in space as a new frontier. Regarding &quot;heroes&quot;, several novels by H. G. Wells have the protagonist as nameless, and often powerless, in the face of natural forces. The evolutionary perspective can be seen in tales involving long time periods, such as &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by Wells, or &quot;Star Maker&quot; by Olaf Stapledon. Even in scientific romances that did not involve vast stretches of time, the issue of whether mankind was just another species subject to evolutionary pressures often arose, as can be seen in parts of &quot;The Hampdenshire Wonder&quot; by J. D. Beresford and several works by S. Fowler Wright. Regarding space, C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; took the position that &quot;as long as humanity remains flawed and sinful, our exploration of other planets will tend to do them more harm than good&quot;; and most scientific romance authors had not even that much interest in the topic. As for bleakness, it can be seen in many of the works by all the authors already cited, who deemed humanity flawed — either by original sin or, much more often, by biological factors inherited from our ape ancestors. Stableford also notes that some of the British scientific romances were saved from &quot;being entirely gloomy&quot; by their philosophical speculation (calling them works of &quot;modest armchair philosophizing&quot;). He cites E. V. Odle&#x27;s &quot;The Clockwork Man&quot;, John Gloag&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Yesterday&quot; and Murray Constantine&#x27;s &quot;Proud Man&quot; as examples of this type of scientific romance.

Nonetheless, not all British science fiction from that period comports with Stableford&#x27;s thesis. Some, for example, revelled in adventures in space and took an optimistic view of the future. By the 1930s there were British authors such as Eric Frank Russell who were intentionally writing &quot;science fiction&quot; for American publication. At that point British writers who used the term &quot;scientific romance&quot; did so either because they were unaware of science fiction or because they chose not to be associated with it.

After the Second World War the influence of American science fiction caused the term &quot;scientific romance&quot; to lose favour, a process accelerated by the fact that few writers of scientific romance considered themselves &quot;scientific romance&quot; writers, instead viewing themselves as just writers who occasionally happened to write scientific romances. Even so, the influence of the scientific romance era persisted in British science fiction. John Wyndham&#x27;s work has been cited as providing &quot;a bridge between traditional British scientific romance and the more varied science fiction which has replaced it&quot;. Some commentators believe scientific romance had some impact on the American variety.

<text>Talia Rose Shire (née Coppola; born April 25, 1946) is an American actress, best known for her roles as Connie Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy and Adrian Pennino Balboa in the &quot;Rocky&quot; series. For her work in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and &quot;Rocky&quot;, Shire was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress, respectively, and for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama for her role in &quot;Rocky&quot;.

== Early life and family ==

Shire was born Talia Rose Coppola in the Woodhaven section of Queens, New York, in 1946.
Her paternal grandparents came to the United States from Bernalda, Basilicata. Her maternal grandfather, popular Italian composer Francesco Pennino, emigrated from Naples, Italy. 

Shire is the only daughter of Italia (née Pennino) and arranger/composer Carmine Coppola. She is the sister of director and producer Francis Ford Coppola, and of the academic August Coppola, the aunt of actor Nicolas Cage, and of director Sofia Coppola, and the niece of composer and conductor Anton Coppola.

At a young age her family moved to Lake Success on Long Island, New York, where she lived through high school.

She has three children. Her son Matthew Orlando Shire is the child of her first marriage to composer David Shire, and is an accomplished TV writer and film producer. Her other sons, actors/musicians Jason and Robert, are from her second marriage, to the film producer Jack Schwartzman.

== Career ==

Shire portrayed Connie Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot; and its sequels and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974). For her portrayal of Adrian Pennino, the love interest of Rocky Balboa in &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), she won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress, the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress, and was nominated for both the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actress. In addition to reprising her Adrian role in four &quot;Rocky&quot; sequels, Shire has appeared in such films as &quot;Kiss the Bride&quot; (2002), &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004), and &quot;Homo Erectus&quot; (2007).

<text>Carol Elaine Channing (January 31, 1921 – January 15, 2019) was an American actress, comedian, singer and dancer who starred in Broadway and film musicals. Each of her characters typically possessed a fervent expressiveness and an easily identifiable voice.

Channing originated the lead roles in &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; in 1949 and &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; in 1964, winning the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for the latter. She revived both roles several times throughout her career, playing Dolly on Broadway for the final time in 1995. She was nominated for her first Tony Award in 1956 for &quot;The Vamp&quot;, followed by a nomination in 1961 for &quot;Show Girl&quot;. She received her fourth Tony Award nomination for the musical &quot;Lorelei&quot; in 1974.

As a film actress, she won the Golden Globe Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Muzzy in &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967). Her other film appearances include &quot;The First Traveling Saleslady&quot; (1956) and &quot;Skidoo&quot; (1968). On television, she appeared as an entertainer on variety shows. She performed The White Queen in the TV production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1985), and she had the first of many TV specials in 1966, titled &quot;An Evening with Carol Channing&quot;.

Channing was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1981 and received a Lifetime Achievement Tony Award in 1995. She continued to perform and make appearances well into her 90s, singing songs from her repertoire and sharing stories with fans, cabaret-style. She was one of the &quot;legends&quot; interviewed in the award-winning documentary, &quot;&quot;. She released her autobiography, &quot;Just Lucky I Guess&quot;, in 2002, and &quot;Larger Than Life&quot;—a documentary film about her life and career—was released in 2012.

==Early life==
Channing was born in Seattle, Washington, on January 31, 1921, the only child of Adelaide (née Glaser; 1886–1984) and George Channing (1888–1957). Adelaide Channing was of German Jewish ancestry. George Channing, born George Christian Stucker, changed his surname for religious reasons before Carol&#x27;s birth. His birth certificate described him as &quot;colored&quot;; his mother was Black, and his father was German-American. George Channing became a Christian Science practitioner, editor, and teacher. A city editor at &quot;The Seattle Star&quot;, he took a job at &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot;; the family moved to California when Carol Channing was two years old. Carol Channing was raised in the Christian Science church.

During a 1994 interview, Channing revealed that she first wanted to perform on stage as a singer when she was in the fourth grade. She recalled being emotionally drawn to the stage after seeing Ethel Waters perform. Channing has said that in the fourth grade she ran for and was elected class secretary: &quot;I stood up in class and campaigned by kidding the teachers. The other kids laughed. I loved the feeling — it was a very good feeling; it still is.&quot; She read the class minutes every Friday, often impersonating the children who were discussed. Her election to class secretary continued through grammar and high school: &quot;It was very good training—like stock.&quot; She also considered the fact that she was able to see plays while very young to have been an important inspiration:

Channing attended Aptos Junior High School and Lowell High School in San Francisco, graduating in 1938. She won the Crusaders&#x27; Oratorical Contest and a free trip to Hawaii with her mother in June 1937. When she was 17, Channing left home to attend Bennington College in Vermont, and her mother told her for the first time that her father had Black ancestry. Her mother felt that the time was right to tell Carol this since she was going off to college; she did not want Carol to be surprised if she ever had a Black baby. Channing wrote: Channing publicly revealed her African-American ancestry in 2002.

Channing majored in drama and dance at Bennington. She would entertain every Friday night. During her junior year, she began trying out for acting parts on Broadway. After playing a small part in the revue, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; noted her performance: &quot;You&#x27;ll be hearing more from a comedienne named Carol Channing.&quot; The inspiration she received from that brief notice made her decide to quit school. However, it was four years before she found another acting job. During that period, she performed at small functions or benefits, including some in the Catskill resorts. She also worked in a Macy&#x27;s bakery.

==Career==
===Stage===
Channing was introduced to the stage while helping her mother deliver newspapers to the backstage of theatres.

Her first job on stage in New York City was in Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s &quot;No for an Answer,&quot; starting January 1941, at the Mecca Temple (later New York City Center). She was 19. She moved to Broadway for &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It!&quot;, where she was an understudy for Eve Arden, who was 13 years older than Channing. Much later, in 1966, Arden was hired for the title role in &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; in a road company when Channing left to star in the film &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;. Channing won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago&#x27;s theatres in 1966 (Eve Arden won the next year).
Five years later, Channing had a featured role in &quot;Lend an Ear&quot; (1948), for which she received her Theatre World Award and launched her as a star performer. She credited illustrator Al Hirschfeld for helping make her a star when he put her image in his widely published illustrations. She said that his drawing of her as a flapper was what helped her get the lead in her next play, the Jule Styne and Anita Loos musical &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;. From that role, as Lorelei Lee, she gained recognition, with her signature song from the production, &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend,&quot; among the most widely known.

In January 1950, &quot;Time&quot; magazine ran a cover story about her becoming a new star on Broadway, followed by cover stories in &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1955 and 1964.

In 1956, Channing married her manager and publicist Charles Lowe. During the 1950s, he produced the Burns and Allen comedy show, which starred George Burns and Gracie Allen. When Allen was forced to discontinue performing due to heart ailments, she saw that Burns needed a partner to play against on stage since he was best as a straight man. She remembered that Channing, like she, had one of the most distinctive and recognizable voices in show business, and Lowe asked Channing if she would perform with Burns. She accepted immediately, and Channing worked on and off with Burns through the late 1950s. Burns also appeared in her TV special, &quot;An Evening with Carol Channing&quot;, in 1966.

In 1961, Channing became one of the few performers nominated for a Tony Award for work in a revue (rather than a traditional book musical); she was nominated for Best Actress in a Musical for the short-lived revue &quot;Show Girl&quot;.
Channing came to national prominence as the star of Jerry Herman&#x27;s &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1964). Her performance as Dolly Levi won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. She recalled that playwright Thornton Wilder so loved the musical, which was based on his play, &quot;The Matchmaker&quot;, that he came once a week. He also planned to rewrite his 1942 play &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, with Channing playing the parts of both Mrs. Antrobus and Sabina but died before he could finish it.

Approval of her performance in the 1960s meant she was often invited to major events, including those at the White House, where she might sing. Channing was a registered Democrat and was invited to the Democratic convention in 1964 in Atlantic City, New Jersey where she sang &quot;Hello, Lyndon&quot; for Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s campaign. She was a favorite of Lady Bird Johnson, who once gave her a huge bouquet after a show. In 1967, she also became the first celebrity to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show.

The old-fashioned plot of &quot;Hello, Dolly&quot;, when first described, might seem uninspired, says columnist Dick Kleiner:

The show had first opened on Broadway on January 16, 1964, and by the time the show closed in late December 1970, it had become the longest-running musical in Broadway history, with nearly 3,000 performances. Besides Channing, six other stars played the title role during those seven years: Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, Betty Grable, Pearl Bailey, Phyllis Diller and Ethel Merman.

Al Hirschfeld&#x27;s illustration of her was printed on the front page of the &quot;Sunday Theatre&quot; section of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She felt that this image captured the essence of her character, having posited in writing, &quot;How did the great Hirschfeld know precisely what I was thinking? ... To be Hirschfelded is an eerie experience. You better not have anything to hide, because he&#x27;ll expose it like a neon sign&quot; ... The illustration was also printed on the cover of magazines, including &quot;Horizon&quot;. She later appeared in the movie biography about his life, &quot;The Line King&quot;, in 1996.

Channing reprised her role of Lorelei Lee when the musical &quot;Lorelei&quot;, directed by Robert Moore and choreographed by Ernest O. Flatt, premiered in 1973 at the Oklahoma City (6000 seat) Civic Center Music Hall and broke all box office records after six days&#x27; worth of performances sold out within 24 hours.

To commemorate this record event, the street running in front of the Music Hall was renamed Channing Square Drive in her honor. Also in the cast were Peter Palmer, Brandon Maggart, Dody Goodman, and Lee Roy Reams. For nearly a year, the stage musical then toured 11 cities across the country. &quot;Lorelei&quot; had earned a hefty profit by the time it opened on Broadway at the Palace Theatre on January 27, 1974, and ran for a total of 320 performances. Channing also appeared in two New York City revivals of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, and toured with it extensively throughout the United States.

She performed songs from &quot;Hello, Dolly&quot; during a special television show in London in 1979.

===Film===
Channing also appeared in a number of films, including &quot;The First Traveling Saleslady&quot; (1956), in which she gave future star Clint Eastwood his first onscreen kiss; the cult film &quot;Skidoo&quot;; and &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (starring Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, John Gavin, and Beatrice Lillie). For &quot;Millie&quot; she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and was awarded a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture. Channing said she was especially grateful to Andrews for helping her develop her character: &quot;She will forever be my angel,&quot; she says.

Due to her success on Broadway in &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; and her co-starring role in &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;, Channing attracted the attention of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, who were interested in starring her in a sitcom. Directed and produced by Arnaz and written by Bob Carroll Jr. and Madelyn Davis (who co-wrote &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;), &quot;The Carol Channing Show&quot; starred Channing as Carol Hunnicut, a small-town girl trying and failing to make it in New York City show business. Character actors Richard Deacon and Jane Dulo were in the supporting cast. The pilot was filmed in front of a live audience (with a laugh track added) at Desilu in 1966 but did not sell as a series.
During her film career, Channing also made some guest appearances on television sitcoms and talk shows, including &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; where she appeared in 11 episodes from 1962 to 1966. Channing did voice-over work in cartoons, most notably as Grandmama in an animated version of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; from 1992 to 1995.

===Television===
During most of her career, Channing was asked to perform in various skits or appear as a guest on regular shows. In the 1960s, she was on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. In 1974, she participated in the television special &quot;Free to Be... You and Me,&quot; based on Marlo Thomas&#x27; best-selling album of 1972, in which Channing also appeared. &quot;Free...&quot; won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Special and The Peabody Award. In 1980, she guest starred on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; where she participated in several skits, performed a medley of Jeepers Creepers, and sang her signature song, Diamonds are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend, as a duet with Miss Piggy. In 1985, she played the role of the White Queen in the television special &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. In 1986, Channing appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and sang a parody of the song &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; called &quot;Hello, Sammy!&quot;, a love song being sung by Carol to a character known as Sammy the Snake (as voiced by Muppets creator Jim Henson). Carol, in this parody segment, serenades Sammy telling him just how much she loves and adores him while Sammy coils himself around Carol&#x27;s arms. Carol&#x27;s song includes lyrics such as: &quot;So..turn on your charm, Sammy/Coil yourself around my arm, Sammy/Sammy the Snake, I&#x27;ll stake a claim on you&quot;. Songwriter Jule Styne, who wrote the score for &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, invited her on his television special in 1987 where she performed another one of her signature songs, &quot;Little Girl from Little Rock&quot;.

In 1993, she poked fun at herself in an episode of &quot;The Nanny&quot;. The episode &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Lies&quot; shows the producer auditioning for a new musical, and Channing, playing herself, is trying out. Just after the producer announces he wants a stage presence that is instantly recognizable to the entire country, Channing begins with her signature &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, but he stops her with a resounding &quot;Next!&quot;.

In January 2003, Channing recorded the audiobook of her best-selling autobiography &quot;Just Lucky, I Guess: A Memoir of Sorts&quot;, directed and produced by Steve Garrin at VideoActive Productions in New York City. It was during the recording sessions that she received a phone call from her childhood sweetheart Harry Kullijian that rekindled their romance and led to their marriage a few months later. In January 2008, the documentary &quot;Carol Channing: Larger Than Life&quot; (which chronicles Channing&#x27;s life and career) was released.

==Personal life==
Channing was married four times. Her first husband was Theodore Naidish, whom she married in 1941 when she was 20. He was a writer who in 1944 wrote &quot;Watch Out for Willie Carter&quot;, but during the nearly five years of their marriage, earned little income: &quot;There was no money for food, clothing or housing.&quot; Still, Channing adored his émigré Jewish family, stating in her memoir, &quot;There is nothing so safe and secure as an immigrant, foreign-language-speaking family all around you. It was a dream come true for me. They look after you, you look after them. They make chick&#x27;n in the pot if you&#x27;re sick. You learn marvelous new-sounding words every minute.&quot; Channing and Naidish lived near his grandparents in Brighton Beach in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. She remembered his grandfather Sam Cohen introducing her to some of his neighborhood friends, who were amazed that she enjoyed hearing their funny stories. &quot;They were delighted that I almost ate them up alive,&quot; she wrote, &quot;because they were so funny, especially since such appreciation was coming from what we all thought then was a shiksa (me).&quot; She learned to speak fluent Yiddish from &quot;Grandpa Cohen&quot;, a skill that helped her understand the boardwalk conversations that went on around her in town.

Channing&#x27;s second husband, Alexander F. Carson, known as Axe, or &quot;The Murderous Ax&quot;, played center for the Ottawa Rough Riders Canadian football team and was also a private detective. They married in 1950 and divorced in September 1956. They had one son, Channing Carson.

In September 1956, &quot;immediately following the entry of the divorce decree&quot; from Carson, Channing married her manager and publicist Charles Lowe. In 1960, Carson&#x27;s parental rights to the couple&#x27;s son were severed due to his abandonment, and his and Channing&#x27;s son took his stepfather&#x27;s surname. As the judge stated, &quot;The differences in environment and miles would result in a gross injustice in itself to the child, who at this very tender stage does not even know what his real father looks like. He probably doesn&#x27;t even realize that the present husband of Mrs. Channing is not his father.&quot; Channing Lowe publishes his cartoons as Chan Lowe. Channing filed for divorce from Lowe in 1998, but her estranged husband died before the divorce was finalized.

After Lowe&#x27;s death and until shortly before her fourth marriage, Channing&#x27;s companion was Roger Denny, an interior designer.

In 2003, while recording the audiobook of her autobiography &quot;Just Lucky, I Guess&quot;, at VideoActive Productions, NYC, produced and directed by Steve Garrin, Channing rekindled her romance with her junior high school sweetheart, Harry Kullijian, and they married on May 10, 2003. They later performed at their old junior high school in a benefit for the school. They also promoted arts education in California schools through their &quot;Dr. Carol Channing and Harry Kullijian Foundation&quot;. They resided in both Modesto, California, and Rancho Mirage, California. They would also spent some of their time in Palm Springs. Harry Kullijian died on December 26, 2011, the eve of his 92nd birthday.

Channing had unique dietary habits. In 1978, she said she had not eaten restaurant food in 15 years and preferred only organic food. When invited to restaurants, she brought several sealed containers with her own food, such as zucchini or chopped celery, and simply asked for an empty plate and glass. For dessert, she ate seeds. By 1995, Channing had resumed eating food served by restaurants. However, she did not drink alcoholic beverages of any kind.

Channing was a Christian Scientist and a survivor of ovarian cancer.

Channing died from natural causes on January 15, 2019, at her home in Rancho Mirage, California, at the age of 97, 16 days before her 98th birthday. On January 16, 2019, the lights on Broadway were dimmed in her honor. A crowd congregated outside the St. James Theatre, as it had also been the anniversary of the opening of the original Broadway production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;. Betty Buckley dedicated the January 15, 2019 performance of the national tour of the revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; in San Diego to Channing following her death. Channing&#x27;s ashes were scattered between the Curran Theatre and the Geary Theater in San Francisco.

<text>The Albany Congress (June 19 – July 11, 1754), also known as the Albany Convention of 1754, was a meeting of representatives sent by the legislatures of seven of the British colonies in British America: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Those not in attendance included Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Representatives met daily at the City Hall () in Albany, New York, from June 19 to July 11, 1754, to discuss better relations with the Native American tribes and common defensive measures against the French threat from Canada in the opening stage of the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War between Great Britain and France.

Delegates did not have the goal of creating an American nation; rather, they were colonists with the more limited mission of pursuing a treaty with the Mohawks and other major Iroquois tribes. This was the first time that American colonists had met together, and it provided a model that came into use in setting up the Stamp Act Congress in 1765, as well as the First Continental Congress in 1774, which were preludes to the American Revolution.

== Overview ==
The Albany Congress was the first time in the 18th century that American colonial representatives met to discuss some manner of formal union. In the 17th century, some New England colonies had formed a loose association called the New England Confederation, principally for purposes of defense, as raiding was frequent by French and allied Indian tribes. In the 1680s, the British government created the Dominion of New England as a unifying government over the colonies between the Delaware River and Penobscot Bay, but it was dissolved in 1689. Jacob Leisler summoned an intercolonial congress which met in New York on May 1, 1690 to plan concerted action against the French and Indians, but he attracted only the colonies as far south as Maryland.

== History ==
The Albany delegates spent most of their time debating Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s Albany Plan of Union to create a unified level of colonial government. The delegates voted approval of a plan that called for a union of 11 colonies, with a president appointed by the British Crown. Each colonial assembly would send 2 to 7 delegates to a &quot;grand council,&quot; which would have legislative powers. The Union would have jurisdiction over Indian affairs.

The plan was rejected by the colonies&#x27; legislatures, which were protective of their independent charters, and by the Colonial Office, which wanted a military command. Many elements of the plan were later the basis for the American government established by the Articles of Confederation of 1777 (which formally went into effect in 1781) and the Constitution of 1787. Franklin speculated in 1789 that the colonies might not have separated from England so soon if the 1754 plan had been adopted:

The Congress and its Albany Plan have achieved iconic status as presaging the formation of the United States of America in 1776. It is often illustrated with Franklin&#x27;s famous snake cartoon &quot;Join, or Die&quot;.

=== Plan of Union ===

Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s plan to unite the colonies exceeded the scope of the congress, which had been called to plan a defense against the French and Indian threat. The original plan was heavily debated by all who attended the conference, including the young Philadelphia lawyer Benjamin Chew. Numerous modifications were also proposed by Thomas Hutchinson, who later became Governor of Massachusetts. The delegates passed the plan unanimously. They submitted it with their recommendations, but the legislatures of the seven colonies rejected it, as it would have removed some of their existing powers. The plan was never sent to the Crown for approval, although it was submitted to the British Board of Trade, which also rejected it.

The Plan of Union proposed to include all the British North American colonies, although none of the colonies south of Maryland sent representatives to the Albany Congress. (Note that the &quot;Lower Counties on the Delaware&quot; were then administered by Pennsylvania, and Georgia Colony was slow to start.) The plan called for a single executive (President-General) to be appointed by the King, who would be responsible for relations with the Indians, military preparedness, and execution of laws regulating various trade and financial activities. It called for a Grand Council to be selected by the colonial legislatures, with the number of delegates to be apportioned according to the taxes paid by each colony. The colonial assemblies rejected the plan, although delegates forming the government after the Revolution incorporated some features in the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution.

== Participants ==
Twenty-one representatives attended the Congress from New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire. New York Governor James DeLancey was host governor and Chairman. Peter Wraxall served as Secretary to the Congress.

Delegates included:
* Connecticut: William Pitkin‡, Roger Wolcott, Elisha Williams

<doc id="225550" wikidata="Q944717" url="?curid=225550" title="Virginia Declaration of Rights">
<text>The Virginia Declaration of Rights was drafted in 1776 to proclaim the inherent rights of men, including the right to reform or abolish &quot;inadequate&quot; government. It influenced a number of later documents, including the United States Declaration of Independence (1776) and the United States Bill of Rights (1789).

==Drafting and adoption==

The Declaration was adopted unanimously by the Fifth Virginia Convention at Williamsburg, Virginia on June 12, 1776, as a separate document from the Constitution of Virginia which was later adopted on June 29, 1776. In 1830, the Declaration of Rights was incorporated within the Virginia State Constitution as Article I, but even before that Virginia&#x27;s Declaration of Rights stated that it was &#x27;&quot;the basis and foundation of government&quot; in Virginia. A slightly updated version may still be seen in Virginia&#x27;s Constitution, making it legally in effect to this day.

Ten articles were initially drafted by George Mason , 1776; three other articles were added in committee, seen in the original draft in the handwriting of Thomas Ludwell Lee, but the author is unknown.
James Madison later proposed liberalizing the article on religious freedom, but the larger Virginia Convention made further changes. It was later amended by Committee and the entire Convention, including the addition of a section on the right to a uniform government (Section 14). Patrick Henry persuaded the convention to delete a section that would have prohibited bills of attainder, arguing that ordinary laws could be ineffective against some terrifying offenders.

Edmund Pendleton proposed the line &quot;when they enter into a state of society&quot; which allowed slave holders to support the declaration of universal rights which would be understood not to apply to slaves as they were not part of civil society. Mason owned over 100 slaves at the time.

Mason based his initial draft on the rights of citizens described in earlier works such as the English Bill of Rights (1689) and the writings of John Locke. The Declaration can be considered the first modern Constitutional protection of individual rights for citizens of North America. It rejected the notion of privileged political classes or hereditary offices such as the members of Parliament and House of Lords described in the English Bill of Rights.

The Declaration consists of sixteen articles on the subject of which rights &quot;pertain to [the people of Virginia] ... as the basis and foundation of Government.&quot; In addition to affirming the inherent nature of rights to life, liberty, property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety, the Declaration both describes a view of Government as the servant of the people, and enumerates its separation of powers into the administration, legislature, and judiciary. Thus, the document is unusual in that it not only prescribes legal rights, but it also describes moral principles upon which a government should be run. The paper the Declaration is written on bears a watermark of the coat of arms of British king George III, possibly necessary to comply with the Stamp Act imposed on the American colonies.

Articles 1–3 address the subject of rights and the relationship between government and the governed. Article 1 states that &quot;all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights of which ... they cannot deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety,&quot; a statement later made internationally famous in the second paragraph of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, as &quot;we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;

Articles 2 and 3 state the concept that &quot;all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people ...&quot; and that &quot;whenever any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.&quot;

Article 4 asserts the equality of all citizens, rejecting the notion of privileged political classes or hereditary offices – another criticism of British institutions such as the House of Lords and the privileges of the peerage: &quot;no set of men, are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services; which, not being descendible, neither ought the offices of magistrate, legislator, or judge be hereditary.&quot;

Articles 5 and 6 recommend the principles of separation of powers and free elections, &quot;frequent, certain, and regular&quot; of executives and legislators: &quot;That the legislative and executive powers of the state should be separate and distinct from the judicative; and, that the members of the two first ... should, at fixed periods, be reduced to a private station, return into that body from which they were originally taken ... by frequent, certain, and regular elections.&quot;

Articles 7–16 propose restrictions on the powers of the government, declaring the government should not have the power of suspending or executing laws, &quot;without consent of the representatives of the people&quot;; establishing the legal rights to be &quot;confronted with the accusers and witnesses, to call for evidence in his favor, and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage,&quot; and to prevent a citizen from being &quot;compelled to give evidence against himself.&quot; protections against &quot;cruel and unusual punishments&quot;, baseless search and seizure, and the guarantees of a trial by jury, freedom of the press, freedom of religion (&quot;all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion&quot;), and &quot;the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free state&quot; rested in a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, that standing armies in time of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; Article 8 protects a person against &quot;being deprived of his liberty except by the law of the land&quot; which later evolved into the due process clause in the federal Bill of Rights. Article 12 is the first ever codification of the right to a free press and was an important precursor to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==Text==
The following is the complete text of the Virginia Declaration of Rights:

The committee draft was written chiefly by George Mason, and the final version was adopted by the Virginia Convention with significant amendments by Robert C. Nicholas and James Madison on June 12, 1776.

==Influence==
The Virginia Declaration of Rights heavily influenced later documents. The Committee of Five is thought to have drawn on it when they drafted the United States Declaration of Independence in the same month (June 1776). James Madison was also influenced by the Declaration while drafting the Bill of Rights (introduced September 1789, ratified 1791).

The Virginia Declaration of Rights was one of the earliest documents to emphasize the protection of individual rights, rather than protecting only members of Parliament or consisting of simple laws that can be changed as easily as passed. For instance, it was the first declaration of rights to call for a free press.

Virginia&#x27;s western counties cited the Declaration of Rights as a justification for rejecting the state&#x27;s Ordinance of Secession before the American Civil War. The delegates to the Wheeling Convention argued that under the Declaration of Rights, any change in the form of government had to be approved by a referendum. Since the Secession Convention had not been convened by a referendum, the western counties argued that all of its acts were void. This set in motion the chain of events that ultimately led the western counties to break off as the separate state of West Virginia.

<text>The German People&#x27;s Party (German: , DVP) was a conservative-liberal political party during the Weimar Republic that was the successor to the National Liberal Party of the German Empire. Along with the left-liberal German Democratic Party (DDP), it represented political liberalism in Germany between 1918 and 1933.

The party&#x27;s best known politician was its founding chairman and later Chancellor and Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann. With the exception of two short-lived cabinets in 1921 and 1922, the DVP was represented in all Weimar governments from 1920 to 1931. In the late 1920s it turned more to the right politically but could not compete with other nationalist parties. By 1932 the DVP&#x27;s share of the vote had shrunk to barely over one percent, and it disbanded shortly after the Nazi seizure of power in 1933.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
Following the end of World War I and the collapse of the German Empire, the party system in Germany remained largely in place because the groups with a common religion, social status, culture, etc. had for the most part survived. In the political center, there were strong efforts in both the Progressive People&#x27;s Party (FVP) and the National Liberal Party (NLP) to overcome the historical split between &quot;democrats&quot; (more left-liberal, as the FVP) and &quot;liberals&quot; (more to the right, as the NLP) and to form a large middle class democratic party. Economist and banker Hjalmar Schacht, economist and sociologist Alfred Weber and journalist and editor Theodor Wolff were the driving forces.

At the beginning of the 1918 November Revolution that brought down the German Empire, party leaders Gustav Stresemann (National Liberals) and Otto Fischbeck (Progressive Liberals) also discussed such possibilities. Negotiations between the two parties began on 15 November 1918, and on the same day they agreed on a program that required significant concessions from the National Liberals, including a commitment to a republic as the future form of government. On 16 November representatives of both parties issued an &quot;Appeal for the Formation of a German Democratic Party&quot;. For the first time it seemed possible to unite the middle class non-sectarian forces in Germany. When Stresemann asked Alfred Weber whether he could be admitted to the executive committee of the new party, the latter expressed reservations because during World War I Stresemann had become known as an annexationist, i.e., someone who favored increasing Germany&#x27;s power by annexing land either in Europe or as overseas colonies. Weber did not, however, object to collaboration with Stresemann or to his candidacy for the Weimar National Assembly.

Further negotiations on the merger on 18 and 19 November ultimately failed because the majority of National Liberal board members were not prepared to lose their political head and most gifted speaker. As a result, on 20 November Stresemann and three other leading National Liberals drew up an appeal for the formation of the German People&#x27;s Party. It was founded provisionally on 22 November 1918 and permanently on 15 December 1918 by a resolution of the central executive committee of the former National Liberal Party. They stressed the importance of members viewing the action not as the foundation of a new party but rather as a reorganization of the old National Liberal Party. The executive committee&#x27;s resolution was approved only narrowly, by a vote of 33 to 28. 

Most of the National Liberal Party&#x27;s center and right wing joined the DVP. Between 22 November and 15 December there were additional attempts to reach an agreement with the new German Democratic Party (DDP), which had been formed out of the Progressive People&#x27;s Party and the more left-leaning members of the National Liberal Party, but these failed. Stresemann remained chairman of the DVP until his death in 1929.

=== Establishment and consolidation ===
Although the DVP initially rejected the Weimar Constitution, it participated in almost all Reich governments from 1920 to 1931. This was primarily due to Stresemann. Although he was at heart a monarchist, he recognized that a return to monarchy could only be achieved through a coup followed by civil war, a path he firmly rejected. At the party congress in Jena on 13 April 1919, he said: &quot;We must not proceed from one bloodbath to another. ... The path to domestic peace can only be on the basis of a republican form of government. That is why we are working for it.&quot;

Initially, this balancing act – cooperation in forming the new state despite rejection of the Republic – was successful. The party criticized the Treaty of Versailles and the enormous burdens associated with it as well as the tax policy of Finance Minister Matthias Erzberger of the Catholic Centre Party, which especially affected the middle class. Unlike the nationalist-conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), the DVP was not directed destructively against the Weimar Republic but combined its criticisms with proposals for reform that stayed within the system. During the 1920 Kapp Putsch, however, the party, like its chairman Stresemann, played a role that was less than friendly to the Republic. At first they openly tolerated the putsch, which attempted to overthrow the Republic and set up an autocratic state in its place, although they opposed the use of violence. Only when the failure of the putsch was obvious did they attempt to mediate between the putschists and the Reich government.

In the 1920 German federal election, the DVP was able to improve its percentage of the vote by almost ten points, to 13.9%. The Weimar coalition made up of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Centre Party and DDP lost the overwhelming majority it had from the 1919 election, falling from 76% to 44%. At the time of the election, the DVP had about 800,000 members.

In June 1920, the German People&#x27;s Party for the first time participated in a Reich government, the Fehrenbach cabinet. The SPD, the leading party in founding the Republic, had suffered significant losses in the election and withdrew into opposition even though it was still the strongest force in the Reichstag at 22% (down from 38%). Its previous coalition partners, the Centre Party and the left-liberal DDP, which had also lost a considerable number of votes to right-wing parties, formed a minority government with the DVP. The SPD decided to accept it on the condition that the DVP protect the Republic. There were three DVP members in the new cabinet: Rudolf Heinze as justice minister and vice chancellor, Ernst Scholz as economics minister, and Hans von Raumer as treasury minister. In May 1921 the DVP left the Reich government when the Fehrenbach cabinet fell, but in the Reichstag it supported on a case-by-case basis the government of Centre Party politician Joseph Wirth, under whom the Weimar coalition had been revived. When the &quot;Cabinet of the Economy&quot; was formed under the nonpartisan Wilhelm Cuno in November 1922, the DVP again participated in the government, with Rudolf Heinze as minister of justice and Johann Becker the economics minister.

The minority government – the parties represented in the government held only 172 of the 459 Reichstag seats – was from the outset under strong pressure from the right and the left, especially since the political situation – the occupation of the Ruhr by France and Belgium in January 1923 and the hyperinflation which peaked in November 1923 – made it difficult for it to govern. After Cuno&#x27;s government broke up under the strain of the Ruhr occupation, Stresemann and the DVP, together with the SPD, Centre Party and DDP, formed their first grand coalition on 13 August 1923. It was the only Reich government led by the German People&#x27;s Party. This basic constellation of the four parties made up the majority of the governments during the short-lived Republic. Although Stresemann was only able to lead the government for three months, since he also was voted out of office due to the Ruhr crisis, the first steps toward consolidating the Weimar Republic were taken during the short period. In spite of fierce attacks from the opposition DNVP, passive resistance to the Ruhr occupation was abandoned and the inflation of 1914 to 1923 was fought successfully with the introduction of the Rentenmark on 15 November 1923.

Although the DVP was unable to maintain its 1920 results of 13.9% of the total votes, it received between 8.7 and 10.1 percent in the three Reichstag elections between 1924 and 1928. Despite Stresemann&#x27;s brief time in office, the German People&#x27;s Party had become fully a part of the Weimar Republic and went on to be one of it mainstays. Stresemann was foreign minister in all subsequent cabinets until his death in October 1929. He made a sustained effort to end Germany&#x27;s foreign policy isolation and to revise the Treaty of Versailles by peaceful means. His involvement was central to the realization of both the 1924 Dawes Plan, which resolved the issue of German payment of war reparations for the short term, and the Locarno Treaties of 1925 which contributed to Germany&#x27;s admission to the League of Nations in 1926. Stresemann, along with his French counterpart Aristide Briand, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926 for their work on the Locarno Treaties.

While the initial cabinets that the DVP participated in were middle class cabinets in which, in addition to the DVP, the Centre, DDP and Bavarian People&#x27;s Party, the DNVP was also sometimes represented, the German People&#x27;s Party also participated in the second cabinet of the Social Democrat Hermann Müller from 1928 to 1930. In foreign policy the DVP was in favor of an understanding with the Western powers and thus of a typically republican foreign policy. After Stresemann&#x27;s death in October 1929, Julius Curtius, the previous economics minister, succeeded him in the foreign office and took a more demanding stance. Stresemann&#x27;s approach, which had been directed towards rapprochement, gave way, according to historian Andreas Rödder, to one of negotiation that nevertheless still pursued its goals peacefully.

=== National Liberal Reich Party ===

The DVP&#x27;s more conservative members never really trusted Stresemann, especially when he became more supportive of the Republic. Even in the early 1920s there was internal opposition to Stresemann, centered especially around the industrial magnate and DVP member Hugo Stinnes. This element sought much closer cooperation with the DNVP but was initially unable to achieve it because of the close ties between the DVP and the Republic. In 1924 former Reich Minister of Economics Johann Becker, together with other representatives of the right wing such as the entrepreneur Albert Vögler, left the DVP and founded the National Liberal Reich Party, which joined the DNVP in 1925. 

=== Downturn and end ===
After Stresemann&#x27;s death in October 1929, Ernst Scholz became party chairman, and the DVP tended more to the right. In Thuringia, for example, it participated in the Baum-Frick government, the first state government with Nazi Party (NSDAP) participation. Although the DVP was represented in Heinrich Brüning&#x27;s first cabinet, its downturn had begun. The Reichstag election of 14 September 1930 sent the DVP back to the low level of 1919, with just 4.5% of the votes and a loss of 15 seats. The moderate party leader Scholz, who was in poor health, had to resign, making way in November 1930 for Eduard Dingeldey. As a representative of the younger generation, he tried to mediate between the party&#x27;s wings in order to make a political comeback with a united DVP.

The elections of 1932 showed that the DVP was unable to compete with the DNVP and the NSDAP when it came to the national consciousness they emphasized. It sank to insignificance, with just 1.2% of the vote and 7 seats in the Reichstag. It joined lists with the DNVP for the Reichstag elections in November and gained four seats. But many representatives of the liberal wing left the party, as did a large number of the members of the German National Association of Commercial Employees () who had chosen the DVP because of their dislike of Alfred Hugenberg of the DNVP.

In the spring of 1933 Otto Hugo, the deputy chairman of the DVP, demanded that the party be completely merged into the NSDAP, but Dingeldey refused. Only after the National Socialists threatened him with personal consequences, did the National Executive Committee () disband the party on 27 June.

== Ideological foundations and program ==
The party was generally thought to represent the interests of German industrialists. Its platform stressed Christian family values, secular education, lower tariffs, opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsidies, and hostility to socialism (Communists and Social Democrats).

The liberal concept of the people which shaped political thinking in the DVP was fed off impulses from Romanticism and Idealism (see Bildungsbürgertum). Like the National Liberal Party of the German Empire, it saw itself primarily as a liberal rather than a democratic party. This was expressed in the fact that in its politics the freedom of the individual from state intervention was more important than the enforcement of majority decisions against the interests of individuals. Its concept of man was shaped by the view that the individual who justifies himself through self-acquired education and property knows better what is important for himself and thus for society as a sum of all its individuals than do the purely quantitative masses. On the other hand, it called on the intellectual and economic elites to have their actions measured against moral standards and to place themselves at the service of society out of a sense of responsibility to it.

Only from these principles can it be understood why the DVP, which as a supporter of a constitutional monarchy had rejected the Weimar Constitution, sided completely with the Republic after the failure of the Kapp Putsch. Stresemann made this clear in a speech on 25 October 1923, in which, as Chancellor, he explained in the face of hyperinflation and the Ruhr struggle: &quot;In the distress of the present, I call &#x27;national&#x27; the man who, when the cart is in the mud, lends a hand to pull it out, but not the man who stands by and says, &#x27;After all, it won&#x27;t help, and you are not the right men to do it.&#x27;&quot;

== Members and representatives ==
The members and representatives of the DVP, who were primarily committed, principled scholars and civil servants, belonged to the middle and upper classes. They represented the wealthy educated middle class which had come together in the National Liberal Party during the Empire. After 1922 there was a party-affiliated student association, the Reich-Committee of University Groups of the German People&#x27;s Party (), whose influence in the predominantly right-wing student body remained comparatively small.

== Voter base ==
The DVP had its voter base predominantly in large and mid-sized cities: in the 1920 Reichstag elections, for example, it won an average of 13.2% of the vote in cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants, while it received only 7.2% of the vote in small communities with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants.

The DVP was also a predominantly Protestant party. In areas with a very high proportion of Catholic voters, the DVP&#x27;s share of the vote always fell far short of its Reich average. In contrast, the lower the proportion of Catholics, the greater the percentage of DVP votes.

The DVP&#x27;s voter structure thus resembled that of the former National Liberal Party in its distribution by denomination and urban versus rural.

===Prussia State elections===
== Support in the press ==
In contrast to the German Democratic Party, which was openly sponsored by the major liberal papers in Berlin (including the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;), the DVP received support only from the &quot;Kölnischen Zeitung&quot; (Cologne), the &quot;Magdeburg Zeitung&quot;, the &quot;Tägliche Rundschau&quot; from Berlin, and the &quot;Königsberger Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. The other major parties of the Weimar Republic were also better positioned in terms of the media. The SPD had its own newspapers, the ideas of the Centre Party were promoted by the Catholic papers and the DNVP had Hugenberg&#x27;s opinion empire behind it.

== Finances ==

Even though the DVP was considered the party of big industrial capital, it always struggled with financial problems. The DDP was able to rely primarily on Berlin and Hamburg businesses, especially in the early days of the Weimar Republic, while the DNVP was mainly supported by Rhenish-Westphalian heavy industry. Hugo Stinnes and Albert Vögler were the only two business barons who were on the side of the German People&#x27;s Party. Stinnes&#x27; death and Vögler&#x27;s resignation from the party, both in 1924, considerably reduced the DVP&#x27;s base of donations. Smaller amounts were contributed by the Kali-Society and the companies of the Hansabund, an anti-monopolistic economic-political interest group led by DVP politician Rießer.

<doc id="225554" wikidata="Q322572" url="?curid=225554" title="Autumn Sonata">
<text>Autumn Sonata () is a 1978 drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, and starring Ingrid Bergman (in her final film role), Liv Ullmann and Lena Nyman. Its plot follows a celebrated classical pianist and her neglected daughter who meet for the first time in years, and chronicles their painful discussions of how they have hurt each other. It was the only collaboration between Ingrid Bergman and Ingmar Bergman (who were not related).

&quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; was the last of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s films to be made for theatrical exhibition; all of his films made after it, even those screened in theatres, were television productions.

==Plot==
Eva, the wife of Viktor, the village pastor, invites her mother Charlotte for a visit to her village after seven years of separation. Charlotte is a world-renowned pianist, somewhat eccentric, aging, and has survived several husbands. Eva is not as talented as the mother (despite having written two books and playing the piano passably), but she takes pride in her life as a wife, mother, and caretaker of her disabled sister Helena, whom she has taken out of the hospital into her own home. Helena&#x27;s condition has left her paralyzed, and Eva is the only one who can understand her limited speech ability. In her everyday life, Eva also struggles with her marriage to Viktor, whom she respects but does not love, and is still deeply affected by the tragic drowning of their son Erik, just one day short of his fourth birthday.

The presence of Helena in Eva&#x27;s house is shocking to the aging mother. She makes a gift of her own wristwatch to Helena, and listens to Eva playing Prelude No. 2 in A minor by Chopin. She immediately re-performs the prelude, offering her own interpretation of the music. Before going to bed, Charlotte decides to make a gift of her own car to her daughter. She plans to take a flight home, and buy a new car for herself, as a measure of her altruism. At night, Charlotte wakes up from a nightmare: it seems that one of her daughters is choking her. She goes into the living room followed by Eva, who had heard her mother screaming from the nightmare.

Mother and daughter begin an impassioned rediscovery of their past relationship. Their conversation turns into a heated confrontation as Eva accuses Charlotte of prioritizing her career and social life over motherhood, undermining her self-worth, and forcing her to have an abortion during a pregnancy with another man—Viktor overhears this but chooses not to intervene. Eva reveals how this neglect devastated Helena as well, leading to her health decline. Charlotte initially defends herself, but eventually admits that she has never truly loved anyone and pointlessly begs Eva for forgiveness. As the argument continues, Helena painfully drags herself out of her bed and crawls toward the stairs leading to the living room where Eva and Charlotte are. Once she reaches the landing, she helplessly calls out, &quot;Mama, come!&quot;

In the morning, Charlotte departs on a train accompanied by her agent and reflects on her unsettling encounter with Helena, asking, &quot;Why couldn&#x27;t she die?&quot; At home, Viktor desperately tries to ease Helena&#x27;s severe emotional breakdown, while Eva visits the grave of her deceased son, grappling with suicidal thoughts. Eva eventually returns home and writes an apology letter to her mother, which Viktor reads aloud. The scene briefly shifts to a different setting, where Eva appears to read the letter to Charlotte, before returning to Viktor, who seals it, leaving its fate uncertain.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Background===
Due to his battle with the Swedish tax authorities at the time, Ingmar Bergman produced &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; through his West German company, Personafilm GmbH, with main financing from Lew Grade&#x27;s British ITC Film, and shot the film in an old film studio outside Oslo in Norway. Although formally a German production (with the German title, &quot;Herbstsonate&quot;, being the official original title), the dialogue is in Swedish, most of the crew and actors were Swedish, and the world premiere was in Stockholm.

Peter Cowie, in the notes to the Criterion DVD edition of the film, summarizes the production, stating: &quot;Shot in Norway, with British and American backing, and featuring Swedish dialogue, &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; emerged from one of the darkest spells in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s life. In 1976 he had gone into voluntary exile in Munich after being accused of evading tax on the income from certain films... Autumn Sonata... marks the swan song of Ingrid Bergman’s career, fulfilled her long-held desire to make a film with her namesake.&quot;

The piano piece in the film is Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Prelude No. 2 in A minor played by Käbi Laretei, whose hands are shown whenever Ingrid Bergman is depicted playing the piano.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
In the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, Dave Kehr opined that &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; &quot;makes good chamber music: it&#x27;s a crafted miniature with Bergman&#x27;s usual bombast built, for once, into the plot requirements.&quot; Conversely, Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that its story was &quot;a dubious variation on familiar neurotic themes&quot; in Bergman&#x27;s work, but also wrote that &quot;one can be impressed by Bergman&#x27;s instrumentalists while rejecting his composition. ... &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; enjoys instant status as an acting showcase.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert ranked the film at No. 5 in his list of &quot;10 Best Films of 1978&quot;.

Retrospective evaluation is favorable. In 2002, Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;When it was released in 1978, Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; received positive to indifferent reviews, written off by many as a minor work from a great director. ... With the burden of high expectations lifted, &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; can finally be seen as an austerely beautiful meditation on death and the not-always-realized possibility of reconciliation across generations.&quot; The film has an 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 33 reviews with the consensus: &quot;A melancholy meditation on the unresolvable tension between parent and child, &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; is a fitting swan song for the great Ingrid Bergman.&quot;

<text>The German Democratic Party (, DDP) was a liberal political party in the Weimar Republic, considered centrist or centre-left. Along with the right-liberal German People&#x27;s Party (, DVP), it represented political liberalism in Germany between 1918 and 1933. It was formed in 1918 from the Progressive People&#x27;s Party and the liberal wing of the National Liberal Party, both of which had been active in the German Empire.

After the formation of the first German state to be constituted along pluralist-democratic lines, the DDP took part as a member of varying coalitions in almost all Weimar Republic cabinets from 1919 to 1932. Before the Reichstag elections of 1930, it united with the , which was part of the national liberal Young German Order (). From that point on the party called itself the German State Party (, DStP) and retained the name even after the Reich Association left the party. Because of the connection to the Reich Association, members of the left wing of the DDP broke away from the party and toward the end of the Republic founded the Radical Democratic Party, which was unsuccessful in parliament. Others joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).

After the National Socialists took power, the German State Party was dissolved on 28 June 1933 as part of the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (coordination) by means of which the Nazis established totalitarian control over German society.

==History==
===Background===
The German Empire had a series of major liberal parties, including the National Liberal Party (NLP). The German Progress Party and Liberal Union merged into the German Free-minded Party. Friedrich Naumann&#x27;s National-Social Association merged into the Free-minded Union in 1903. Theodor Barth and his supporters broke away into the Democratic Union in 1908, and maintained their independence until joining the DDP in 1918. The other liberal parties united into the left-liberal Progressive People&#x27;s Party (FVP) in 1910. The FVP received 1.5 million votes in the 1912 election, the last one before the outbreak of World War I.

===Foundation and rise===


A proposal to merge the NLP and FVP was made in the waning days of World War I, but faced opposition from the NLP&#x27;s right-wing and FVP&#x27;s left-wing. The formation of the German Democratic Party was announced on 16 November. Among the founding members were , Richard Witting, , Hjalmar Schacht, and Kurt von Kleefeld. The group contacted Theodor Wolff, the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;, about how to organize the party. It was named the Democratic Party at Wolff&#x27;s insistence. On 16 November 1918, one week after the November Revolution, an appeal for the founding of a new democratic party was written by Wolff and signed by 60 people. An almost identical statement was published at the same time by the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; (Voss&#x27;s Newspaper). The FVP, NLP&#x27;s left-wing, and DDP merged together on 20 November. Right-wing members of the NLP formed the German People&#x27;s Party (DVP).

The FVP raised 26,000 RM in 1911, and had 1,054 individual contributors in 1912. The DDP raised millions in the leadup to the 1919 election and had over one million members by January 1919. The party won 75 seats in the election and became the third-largest party in the Weimar National Assembly, but their support halved in the 1920 election and their seat total fell to 39.

The DDP was a member of the Scheidemann cabinet, but left in June 1919 in response to the Treaty of Versailles before returning to the coalition in October. Friedrich von Payer resigned as chair of the DDP&#x27;s legislative caucus after voting in favor of the treaty. It was heavily involved with the creation of the Weimar Constitution. The document was drafted by Preuß, Weber influenced the section covering the presidency, and Erich Koch-Weser wrote the section covering referendums.

Naumann served as the first chair of the party until his death in 1919. His faction and ideological allies included Gertrud Bäumer, , , Theodor Heuss, Carl Wilhelm Petersen, and Gustav Stolper. This group held positions of high leadership within the party for the entirety of its history. Petersen served as chair until 1924, when he resigned after his election as mayor of Hamburg.

The &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;, &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;, and &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; were among the leading newspapers that supported the party. Rudolf Oeser, an editor at &quot;FZ&quot;, became a cabinet member. Support for the DDP from these newspapers waned as the party went rightward.

The DDP initially voted against joining the First Wirth cabinet, but later joined it. It left the Wirth cabinet after the partition of Upper Silesia.

===Decline===
20,000 people attended the first national convention of the Young Democratic Organization, but active membership declined to a few thousand members as the 1920s continued and 2,000 people attended the 1929 convention.

The party&#x27;s membership fell from around 800,000 one year after its foundation to 117,000 by 1927. In spite its steadily dwindling size, the DDP played an important political role in the early years of the Republic. For one, its position between the SPD and the Centre Party helped stabilize the Weimar Coalition nationwide and especially in Prussia. Wilhelm Abegg, for example, the state secretary in the Prussian Ministry of the Interior, reorganized and modernized the Prussian police. In addition, members of the DDP formed an important reservoir of personnel for high positions in public administration. No other party was able to provide to a similar extent civil servants who both possessed the professional training and were loyal to the democratic system of the Weimar Republic, something that was not the case with the mostly monarchist and anti-democratic civil servants inherited from the Empire.

In 1920, the DDP had already lost votes, in large measure to the German People&#x27;s Party, German National People&#x27;s Party, and to parties focused on single issues. This was due to disagreements within the DDP over how to deal with the Versailles Peace Treaty, of which some deputies approved. The loss of votes was accompanied by a simultaneous loss of members, finances and journalistic support. Important newspapers such as the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; and the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; held views that were close to those of the DDP, but the party was never able to establish an important party paper of its own such as the SPD&#x27;s &quot;Vorwärts&quot; or later the Nazis&#x27; &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;. The prejudice that the DDP was the &#x27;party of big capital&#x27; held credence among part of the public, a prejudice that was factually false and charged with anti-Semitism. In later years, the Nazi Party exploited this by defaming the DDP as &#x27;the Jewish party&#x27;.

Another reason for the decline was their program of &#x27;social capitalism&#x27; in which workers and owners mutually recognized &quot;duty, right, performance and profit&quot; and where solidarity was to prevail between employees, workers and owners. This visionary idea was out of touch with the reality of rising unemployment and economic difficulties under the pressure of the Treaty of Versailles.

=== Renaming to the German State Party ===
In July 1930, the DDP united with the People&#x27;s National Reich Association (VNR) to form the German State Party, initially for the upcoming Reichstag elections. This brought fierce conflicts within the party, as the VNR was the political arm of Artur Mahraun&#x27;s national liberal Young German Order. After the merger, many members of the left wing, including Ludwig Quidde and Hellmut von Gerlach, left the party and founded the Radical Democratic Party in 1930, which was largely unsuccessful politically. The Young German Order broke away from the DDP immediately after the Reichstag elections, but the DDP nevertheless formally reorganized itself the German State Party (DStP) on 8 November 1930.

The party received 1.3 million votes and 20 seats in the 1930 election. Its electoral performance continued to decline in the 1930s. Its seat total declined by sixteen in the July 1932 election, where it received 371,000 votes. Hermann Dietrich called for the party to be dissolved after these results. Its seat total fell to two after the November 1932 election. Hermann von Richthofen, Peter Reinhold, and others left the party after failing to convince its leadership to dissolve it. It gained three seats in the March 1933 election, but its share of the vote declined. The DStP obtained these five seats with the help of a combined list with the SPD.

The DStP deputies, as opposed to the SPD, voted for the Nazi-sponsored Enabling Act, which effectively disempowered the Reichstag. Their &quot;yes&quot; to the Enabling Act was justified by the deputy Reinhold Maier. The final sentence of his speech read: &quot;In the interest of the people and the Fatherland and in the expectation of lawful developments, we will put aside our serious misgivings and agree to the Enabling Act.&quot;

The DStP deputies in the Landtag of Prussia were removed as they worked with the SDP in their election and was banned from engaging in political activity in Prussia in June. Since the mandates of the DStP’s Reichstag deputies had been won by means of nominations from the Social Democratic Party, they expired in July 1933 based on a provision of the Gleichschaltung Law of 31 March 1933. The self-dissolution of the DStP, forced by the Nazis, took place on 28 June 1933. The law against the formation of new parties enacted on 14 July codified the existence of a single party in the Nazi state and any activity on behalf of other parties was made a punishable offense.

===Resistance to National Socialism===

Individual members of the DStP participated in the resistance to National Socialism. The only left-liberal resistance group, the Robinsohn-Strassmann group, consisted mainly of former DDP/DStP members. A middle-class resistance circle with about sixty members was the Sperr Circle in Bavaria. It consisted of the diplomat Franz Sperr as well as the former Weimar Reich ministers and DDP members Otto Geßler and Eduard Hamm. Many former members of the DDP and Radical Democratic Party also found themselves forced into exile either because of their stance against the regime or their pacifist attitudes, among them Ludwig Quidde and Wilhelm Abegg. Others were murdered by the National Socialists, including Fritz Elsas.

== DDP politicians after World War II ==
After World War II, former members of the DDP were instrumental in founding both the West German Free Democratic Party (FDP) – for example Theodor Heuss, Thomas Dehler and Reinhold Maier – and the East German Liberal Democratic Party (LDPD) – including Wilhelm Külz, Eugen Schiffer and Waldemar Koch – while others such as Ernst Lemmer, Ferdinand Friedensburg and August Bach went to the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), or the Social Democratic Party, including Erich Lüth. Otto Nuschke became leader of the East German CDU.

The youth organization Young Democrats (), which had been close to the DDP, continued to exist until 2018.

==Political positions==
The program of the DDP was a synthesis of liberal and social ideas. Naumann attempted this fusion in the pre-war period. Supporters and members of the party were recruited primarily from the &quot;Bildungsbürgertum&quot;. It was also supported by executives and civil servants, industrialists mainly from the chemical and electrical industries and liberal Jews. More Jews voted for the DDP than for any other party. It was therefore dubbed the &quot;party of Jews and professors&quot;.

The DDP was divided between supporting a centralized or federal system. Weber and Preuß supported a centralized system and breaking up Prussia into multiple states. Otto Fischbeck, Conrad Haußmann, and Payer supported the continued existence of the Prussian state.

The party was divided over changing the flag. Democrats in the north supported maintaining the imperial flag while those in the south supported changing it. The party&#x27;s deputies voted 43 to 14 against the new flag. Bernhard Dernburg, Fischbeck, Georg Gothein, Koch-Weser, Naumann, Petersen, and Schiffer opposed changing the flag while , Haussmann, Nuschke, Payer, and Quidde supported changing it.

The Bavarian affiliate of the DDP, which the DVP merged into, supported anti-clericalism.

The party never accepted the eastern boundaries of Weimar Germany. It supported returning the Free City of Danzig to Germany and uniting Germany and Austria into one country. It initially supported the League of Nations, but this waned due to rulings that did not benefit Germany.

<text>Same Time, Next Year is a 1975 romantic comedy play by Bernard Slade. The plot focuses on two people, married to others, who meet for a romantic tryst once a year for two dozen years.

==Plot==
New Jersey accountant George Peters and Oakland housewife Doris meet at a Northern California inn in February 1951. They have an affair, and agree to meet once a year, despite the fact both are married to others and have six children between them.

There are six scenes over the course of the next 24 years which develop an emotional intimacy deeper than what one would expect to find between two people meeting for a clandestine relationship just once a year. During the time they spend with each other, they discuss the births, deaths, and marital problems each is experiencing at home, while they adapt themselves to the social changes affecting their lives. Between the six scenes are tapes (speeches, songs, sports broadcasts) of that time period that have impacted the characters.

==Productions==
The Broadway production opened on March 14, 1975, at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre with Ellen Burstyn as Doris and Charles Grodin as George and direction by Gene Saks. It transferred to the Ambassador Theatre on May 16, 1978 and remained there until it closed on September 3 the same year. It played a total of 1,453 performances during its run.

Burstyn and Grodin both gave their last performances on October 18, 1975. They were succeeded by Joyce Van Patten and Conrad Janis, who lasted through Nov. 29, 1975, before headlining the show&#x27;s first national tour, which lasted from December 2, 1975 through May 8, 1976. Next up were Loretta Swit and Ted Bessell, who began their run on December 2, 1975. While Swit&#x27;s last performance was on June 19, 1976, Bessell continued with the play until March 6, 1977. His next leading lady was Sandy Dennis, who began her run on June 21, 1976 and lasted until May 29, 1977. By the time Dennis&#x27; run was complete, she was acting opposite Don Murray, who joined the play on March 8, 1977, and lasted until January 1, 1978. Following Dennis was Hope Lange, whose run spanned May 31 to October 22, 1977. After Lange came Betsy Palmer, who played Doris from October 24, 1977 until the September 3, 1978 closing date. In addition to Murray, Palmer acted opposite Monte Markham from January 3 to July 6, 1978, and Charles Kimbrough from July 7 to September 3, 1978.

A second national tour, spanning August 3, 1976 through January 28, 1978, and including a six-month engagement in Chicago, starred Barbara Rush and Tom Troupe. A Los Angeles production from April 12, 1977 to July 2, 1977 was first headlined by Carol Burnett and Dick Van Dyke, then Diahann Carroll and Cleavon Little. Finally, a bus and truck tour from January 13, 1978 to April 22, 1978 starred Kathryn Crosby and Tony Russel.

The original London production opened in 1976, starring Michael Crawford and Frances Cuka at the Prince of Wales Theatre.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Clive Barnes wrote: &quot;Do not put off till tomorrow what you can do today. Get tickets for &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot;... It is the funniest comedy about love and adultery to come Broadway&#x27;s way in years.&quot;

Author Bernard Slade was surprised by the play&#x27;s international popularity. &quot;I felt I was writing a fantasy. Then I started to get letters from people that had had this sort of relationship...The curious thing is how successful it was in other countries. I saw the French production, the Spanish production. In France--where how excited could they get about an extramarital affair?--the only thing they didn&#x27;t quite understand were the psychiatric references.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==

===Original Broadway production===
==Film adaptations==
A 1978 film adaptation directed by Robert Mulligan starred Ellen Burstyn and Alan Alda. The Philadelphia Lantern Theater Company incorporated different photo and music montages of social events 1951-1984 instead of 1951-1977 in the movie.

The play also served as the basis for &quot;I for You&quot;, a 1994 film directed by Hong Kong filmmaker Clifton Ko.

It also served as a basis for the German TV drama &quot;Jedes Jahr im Juni&quot;.

==Sequel==
A two-act sequel, &quot;Same Time, Another Year,&quot; was first produced in 1996 at the Pasadena Playhouse, directed by the author and starring Nancy Dussault and Tom Troupe. It opens on the couple&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 1976 and continues through their February anniversaries of 1980, 1981, 1986, 1992, and 1993. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s review stated, &quot;Through illnesses, career successes and setbacks, second marriages, second families, divorces and grandchildren, Doris and George meet each year to renew their affair, which itself seems forever changing and dynamic.&quot; As for the production &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;a few wonderful comedic moments and some memorable one-liners, but this production is generally flat, overlong and never manages to soar as high as the original.&quot;

<doc id="225560" wikidata="Q514626" url="?curid=225560" title="Tubuai">
<text>Tupuai ( ) is the main island of the Austral Island group, located south of Tahiti. In addition to Tubuai, the group of islands include Rimatara, Rurutu, Raivavae, Rapa and the uninhabited Îles Maria. They are part of the Austral Islands in the far southwest of French Polynesia in the south Pacific Ocean. Tubuai island sustains a population of 2,185 people on 45 km2 of land. Due to its southerly position, Tubuai has notably cooler weather than Tahiti.

The island is ringed by a lagoon formed by an encircling coral reef. A break in the reef that enables passage for ships is located on the north side of the island. Tubuai has two lava domes, with its highest point, Mt Taita&#x27;a, being 422 meters. Six or seven islets or &quot;motu&quot;s lie along the reef rim that encircles the island. These were described in the late 1700s as having an abundance of toa trees (&quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot;), which the indigenous peoples used in house building and to make war clubs and spears due to the wood&#x27;s density.

The islanders speak the Tupuai dialect of the Austral language, which has absorbed significant Tahitian vocabulary.

==History==

===Early Polynesia===
The island has been inhabited since at least 1215CE. In the ancient past a road was built that encircled the island. There exists on the island today the stone ruins of a &quot;great number of structures, house platforms, marae complexes, and cemeteries...&quot; According to David Stanley&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific Handbook&quot;:

&quot;The Austral islands were one of the great art areas of the Pacific, represented today in many museums. The best-known artifacts are tall sharkskin drums, wooden bowls, fly-whisks, and tapa cloth.&quot;
===Arrival of &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers===

Tubuai was first viewed by Europeans when it was mapped by James Cook in 1777, although his party did not disembark. Cook discovered the island&#x27;s name, &quot;Toobouai&quot;, from the natives who surrounded his ship in their canoes; a Tahitian named Omai, who was part of Cook&#x27;s group, translated.

The next Europeans to arrive were the mutineers of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; in 1789. Mutineer Fletcher Christian, in looking for an island on which to permanently hide, had &quot;scoured&quot; William Bligh&#x27;s maps and nautical charts and decided on Tubuai.

Upon arrival at Tubuai, a conflict arose while the mutineers were still on their ship and several islanders were killed in their canoes. The site of this event in the lagoon on the north side of the island is called &quot;Baie Sanglant&quot; &quot;Bloody Bay&quot;.

Mutineer James Morrison wrote: &quot;The Island is full of Inhabitants for its size and may contain 3000 souls.&quot; After only ten days on the island, the mutineers sailed for Tahiti to get women and livestock in which they were only nominally successful. When they returned to Tubuai, they built a fort on the northeast part of the island at Ta&#x27;ahueia, manned with cannon and swivel gun which they named Fort George. The mutineer leader, Fletcher Christian, knew that settling on Tahiti was sure to mean the mutineers&#x27; eventual discovery and arrest, so despite being viewed as intruders, Christian was reluctant to view permanent settlement on Tubuai as unfeasible. Christian favoured using diplomacy over time to eventually obtain wives, but many of the other mutineers insisted on raiding parties to take wives by force.

The islanders of Tubuai did not want to allow their women to stay at the mutineer camp or to allow them to become wives. They also were not disposed to trade food. It was not long before armed parties of mutineers started burning houses and desecrating marae during skirmishes to obtain women. More battles ensued and more natives were killed. One mutineer, the heavily tattooed Thomas Burkett (who was later tried and hanged in England for mutiny), was speared in the side by one of the islanders during one of the skirmishes.

After only two months since their first arrival on Tubuai, the mutineers left for good.

===19th century===
Increased contact with Europeans also meant more exposure to diseases to which the islanders had no immunity. This proved particularly devastating to the population of Tubuai. At some point during the 30 years from when the mutineers left the island on September 17, 1789, and the early 1820s when accounts by Christian missionaries began to be recorded, the population that was estimated by the mutineer Morrison to be 3000 was now reduced to no more than 300 people. One Protestant minister when visiting a congregation on Tubuai on January 3, 1824, wrote that several islanders were still suffering from a devastating illness. He described the symptoms and noted that several hundred had died within the previous four years.

On April 30, 1844, four early missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints arrived in Tubuai. Spearheaded by Addison Pratt, the missionaries baptized 60 residents in the first year. In the coming years, this number would grow to hundreds of baptisms.

==Geography==
Tupua&#x27;i is located just north of the Tropic of Capricorn. The island is at the centre of the Austral Islands, located 195 km from Ra&#x27;ivāvae, 210 km from Rurutu, 700 km from Rapa Iti and 640 km south of Tahiti.

It consists of two former sets of volcanic peaks on Mount Taita&#x27;a () which are separated by the collar of Huahine (). Its area is , surrounded by a large lagoon, the largest of the Austral Islands.

The coral reef that surrounds it in effect creates a lagoon of , an area almost double that of the island. It sometimes reaches wide. Its depth is low, leading to a characteristic colour of turquoise or jade. For a large part, its depth is around . However, it can reach up to in some parts of the south-east. The waters are constantly replenished via a rather strong and fairly constant ocean current, contributing to the preservation of the lagoon habitat and the health of the coral in the reef. The generally cooler waters and until recently very low pollution have also helped sustain this environment.

Many small streams run through the island, though they often empty into swamps rather than the sea. These swamps represent a fairly large portion of the island. Only the river Vaiohuru has any real flow.

Eight offshore &quot;motu&quot; surround the main island (with an additional 0.4 km2):

*Motu One (also known as &quot;îlot de sable&quot; (Sandly Islet) in the North)
*Motu Rautaro
*Motu Toena
*Motu Roa (also called Motu Tāpapatava&#x27;e)
*Motu Mitihā (originally Motiha&#x27;a)
*Motu &#x27;Ōfa&#x27;i (also called &quot;îlot caillou&quot; (Rock Island))
*&#x27;Iri&#x27;iriroa 
*Îlot plat (Flat Island)

The islets above are listed in clockwise direction from the north of the island. The last two islands are often submerged and hence not visible.

The motu &#x27;Ōfa&#x27;i is itself the only island that has not formed through coral because it is composed of basalt, hence its name. It is also the only outcrop of volcanic land other than the main island.

==Climate==
The climate of Tubuai is cooler than Tahiti, with temperatures averaging . The island has hot, muggy summers and warm, humid winters with ample precipitation all year. The lowest temperature measured on the island was on 31 August 1951. The highest was on 25 March 1980. The lagoon waters typically reach in summer but only drop a few degrees in winter.

Rainfall is high, averaging about 2000 mm (78 inches) per year with about 1700 mm (67 inches) per year for the years 2006 and 2007. The highest recorded rainfall 2839 mm (112 inches) in 1962 and the lowest was 1186 mm (47 inches) 1952. The record for rainfall in a day is in turn 191 mm (8 inches) on 23 April 1942.

Hours of sunlight is about average for the Australs and is around 1970 hours per year, one of the lowest levels in Polynesia. The humidity is lower in contrast to Tahiti in the order of a few percent, mainly due to its higher latitude and its lower altitude (thus retaining fewer clouds).

The trade winds coming from southeast are the prevailing winds. Those coming from the North or Northwest are synonymous with a change towards more sunny days. The maximum recorded wind speeds, however, never exceeded 45 m/s.

The island has also been the scene of several cyclones, though they are not very frequent and are often weakened before reaching landfall (as with Cyclone Meena in 2005). However, much bigger cyclones occasionally hit the island. As such, on 5 February 2010, Tupua&#x27;i found itself in the path of Cyclone Oli with winds averaging 160 km/h (gusting nearly 220 km/h).

Average weather records on Tupua&#x27;i:
==Demographics==
Since the 1990s, the island&#x27;s population has stabilised to approximately 2000 inhabitants.

==Administration==
Tubuai is the administrative capital of the Austral Islands, and the commune consists solely of this one island, including the six or seven motus surrounding it. Tubuai was annexed by France in 1881. The commune itself consists of the following associated communes:

*Mahu
*Mataura
*Taahuaia

<text>Jill Clayburgh (April 30, 1944 – November 5, 2010) was an American actress known for her work in theater, television, and cinema. She received the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her breakthrough role in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; (1978). She received a second consecutive Academy Award nomination for &quot;Starting Over&quot; (1979) as well as four Golden Globe nominations for her film performances.

==Early life==
Clayburgh was born in New York City, the daughter of a Protestant mother and a Jewish father. Her mother, Julia Louise (née Dorr), was an actress and theatrical production secretary for producer David Merrick. Her father was Albert Henry &quot;Bill&quot; Clayburgh, a manufacturing executive. Her paternal grandmother was concert and opera singer Alma Lachenbruch Clayburgh (1881-1958). Her brother, Jim Clayburgh, is a scenic designer. 

Clayburgh reportedly never talked about her religious background and was not raised in the faith of either of her parents. Clayburgh never got along with her parents and began therapy at an early age: &quot;I was very rebellious as a teenager, aside from having an unhappy, neurotic childhood. But I just can&#x27;t go into it. I think I had a lot of energy and undirected need so I just kind of rebelled in a general fashion. I got myself in terrible, very personal trouble. Therapy has helped me a lot in my life.&quot;

As a child, Clayburgh was inspired to become an actress when she saw Jean Arthur as &quot;Peter Pan&quot; on Broadway in 1950. She was raised on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, where she attended the all-girls Brearley School. She then attended Sarah Lawrence College, where she studied religion, philosophy and literature, but ultimately decided to be an actress. She received her acting training at HB Studio.

==Career==
===Early career===
Clayburgh began acting as a student in summer stock and, after graduating, joined the Charles Street Repertory Theater in Boston, where she met another up-and-coming actor and future Academy Award-winning star, Al Pacino, in 1967. They met after starring in Jean-Claude Van Itallie&#x27;s play &quot;America, Hurrah&quot;. They had a five-year romance and moved back together to New York City.

In 1968, Clayburgh debuted off-Broadway in the double bill of Israel Horovitz&#x27;s &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Called the Sugar Plum&quot;, also starring Pacino. Clayburgh and Pacino were cast in &quot;Deadly Circle of Violence&quot;, an episode of the ABC television series &quot;NYPD&quot;, premiering November 12, 1968. Clayburgh at the time was also appearing on the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, playing the role of Grace Bolton. Her father would send the couple money each month to help with finances.

She eventually made her Broadway debut in 1968 in &quot;The Sudden and Accidental Re-Education of Horse Johnson&quot;, co-starring Jack Klugman, which ran for 5 performances. In 1969, she starred in an off-Broadway production of the Henry Bloomstein play &quot;Calling in Crazy&quot;, at the Andy Warhol-owned Fortune theatre. She was in a TV pilot that did not sell, &quot;The Choice&quot; (1969) and appeared off Broadway in &quot;The Nest&quot; (1970).

In 1969, Clayburgh made her screen debut in &quot;The Wedding Party&quot;, written and directed by Brian De Palma. &quot;The Wedding Party&quot; was filmed in 1963 (during which Clayburgh was at Sarah Lawrence) but not released until six years later. The film focuses on a soon-to-be groom and his interactions with various relatives of his fiancée and members of the wedding party; Clayburgh played the bride-to-be. Her co-stars included Robert De Niro, in one of his early film roles, and Jennifer Salt. In his review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Howard Thompson wrote, &quot;As the harassed engaged couple, two newcomers, Charles Pfluger and Jill Clayburgh, are as appealing as they can be.&quot;

===Broadway success===

Clayburgh attracted attention when she appeared in the Broadway musical &quot;The Rothschilds&quot; (1970–72) which ran for 502 performances. She then went on to play Desdemona opposite James Earl Jones in the 1971 production of &quot;Othello&quot; in Los Angeles, and had another Broadway success with &quot;Pippin&quot; (1972–75), which ran for 1,944 performances. Clive Barnes of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found Clayburgh to be &quot;all sweet connivance as the widow out to get her man.&quot;

During this time, Clayburgh had a string of brief character parts in film and television. Some of these include &quot;The Telephone Book&quot; (1971), &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; (1972), &quot;The Thief Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; (1974), opposite George Segal.

After guest-starring on an episode of &quot;The Snoop Sisters&quot;, Clayburgh played Ryan O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s ex-wife in &quot;The Thief Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1973) and starred in a TV pilot that was not picked up, &quot;Going Places&quot; (1973). She also guest starred on &quot;Medical Center&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. She hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on February 28, 1976 (Season 1, Episode 15) with musical guest, Leon Redbone. She later returned to Broadway for Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Jumpers&quot;, which ran for 48 performances. Despite her success on Broadway, it was film acting that really excited Clayburgh: &quot;One of the things I like about the movies is the adventure of it,&quot; she said. &quot;I like going to different places and I like doing a different scene every day.&quot;

Clayburgh was praised for her performances in the TV movies &quot;Hustling&quot; (1975), in which she played a prostitute, and &quot;The Art of Crime&quot; (1975). &quot;Hustling&quot; was a departure for her: &quot;Before I did &quot;Hustling&quot; I was always cast as a nice wife. I wasn&#x27;t very good at it. Then with &quot;Hustling&quot;, it was a nice role and it was a departure. People saw a different dimension.&quot; Her performance in the TV film eventually earned her an Emmy nomination; she later said it revitalised her career. &quot;It changed my career,” Clayburgh said. “It was a part that I did well, and suddenly people wanted me. Sidney Furie saw me, and wanted me for &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot;.&quot;

===&quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; and film stardom===
Clayburgh was cast as Carole Lombard in the 1976 biopic &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot; with James Brolin as Clark Gable. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a film with many major assets, not the least of which is the stunning and smashing performance of Clayburgh as Carole Lombard&quot; and &quot;Time Out London&quot; felt she &quot;produced a very modern version of the Lombard larkishness.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that her performance &quot;comes off better&quot; than Brolin&#x27;s Gable, as &quot;she appears to be creating a character whenever the fearfully bad screenplay allows it.&quot; Despite this, he felt both actors were miscast as the famous couple, writing further, &quot;Miss Clayburgh could be an interesting actress, but there are always problems when small performers try to portray the kind of giant legends that Gable and Lombard were. Because both Gable and Lombard are still very much alive in their films on television and in repertory theaters, there is difficulty in responding to Mr. Brolin and Miss Clayburgh in any serious way.&quot;

She starred in the acclaimed TV movie &quot;Griffin and Phoenix&quot; (1976) co-starring with Peter Falk. It tells the story of two ill-fated middle-aged characters who both face a terminal cancer diagnosis and have months left to live. Notably, Clayburgh developed the same type of cancer her character had in this film, succumbing to it in 2010. Also in 1976, she had her first big box office success playing the love interest of Gene Wilder&#x27;s character in the comedy-mystery &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, also starring Richard Pryor. Critics felt Clayburgh had little to do in &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;an actress of too much intelligence to be able to fake identification with a role that is essentially that of a liberated ingenue.&quot;

In 1977, she had another hit with &quot;Semi-Tough&quot;, a comedy set in the world of American professional football, which also starred Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristofferson. Clayburgh played Barbara Jane Bookman, who has a subtle love triangle relationship with both Reynolds and Kristofferson&#x27;s characters. Vincent Canby liked her performance, writing, &quot;Miss Clayburgh, who&#x27;s been asked to play zany heroines in &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot; and &quot;Silver Streak&quot; by people who failed to provide her with material, has much better luck this time. She&#x27;s charming,&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; enjoyed her chemistry with Reynolds: &quot;Reynolds and Clayburgh look wonderful together. They seem to harmonize in a way that would only be more apparent - and make their eventual recognition of being in love seem more appropriate.&quot; Both &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; and &quot;Silver Streak&quot; earned her a reputation &quot;as a popular modern stylist of screwball comedy&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted how Clayburgh &quot;had the kind of warmth and witty sophistication barely seen in Hollywood since Carole Lombard and Jean Arthur&quot;.

Clayburgh&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1978 when she received the first of her two Academy Award for Best Actress nominations for Paul Mazursky&#x27;s &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;. In what would be her career-defining role, Clayburgh was cast as Erica, the courageous abandoned wife who struggles with her new &#x27;single&#x27; identity after her stockbroker husband leaves her for a younger woman. Upon release, &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; drew praise and was popular at the box office, briefly making Clayburgh, at 34, a star. Clayburgh&#x27;s performance garnered some of the best reviews of her career: Roger Ebert called the film &quot;a journey that Mazursky makes into one of the funniest, truest, sometimes most heartbreaking movies I&#x27;ve ever seen. And so much of what&#x27;s best is because of Jill Clayburgh, whose performance is, quite simply, luminous. Clayburgh takes chances in this movie. She&#x27;s out on an emotional limb. She&#x27;s letting us see and experience things that many actresses simply couldn&#x27;t reveal&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Miss Clayburgh is nothing less than extraordinary in what is the performance of the year to date. In her we see intelligence battling feelingreason backed against the wall by pushy needs.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, veteran critic Pauline Kael noted: 

In addition to her Oscar nomination, Clayburgh also earned her first Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (both of which she lost to Jane Fonda for &quot;Coming Home&quot;) and won the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival, which she and Isabelle Huppert shared.

During this time, she turned down the lead in &quot;Norma Rae&quot;, a film that earned Sally Field her first Oscar. Still, in 1979, Clayburgh had a career peak after starring in two movies that garnered her widespread acclaim. The first was Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;La Luna&quot; (1979), which she made in Italy. The film presents an incestuous relationship between a mother and her drug-addicted son, and was poorly received at the time. Clayburgh agreed to star in this film because she felt that &quot;most great roles explore something that is socially taboo.&quot; Bertolucci was especially impressed with her work, having complimented her ability &quot;to move from one extreme to the other in the same shot, be funny and dramatic within the same scene.&quot; Despite the film&#x27;s controversy, Clayburgh&#x27;s performance as a manipulative opera singer was generally praised: Critic Richard Brody called it &quot;her most extravagant role&quot; and a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt she was &quot;extraordinary under impossible circumstances.&quot; Also, in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, Angela Carter wrote, &quot;Jill Clayburgh, seizing by the throat the opportunity of working with a great European director, gives a bravura performance: she is like the life force in person&quot;.

Her second and last film of 1979 was Alan J. Pakula&#x27;s &quot;Starting Over&quot;, a romantic comedy with Burt Reynolds and Candice Bergen. Pakula hired her because, “the extraordinary thing is that she’s so many people. In a Jill Clayburgh movie you don’t know what you’re going to get.&quot; As a nursery-school teacher who falls reluctantly in love with Reynolds’s divorced character, her performance was lauded by &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Miss Clayburgh delivers a particularly sharp characterization that&#x27;s letter-perfect during the first part of the story and unconvincing in the second, through no fault of her own.&quot; &quot;Starting Over&quot; earned her a second Oscar and Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. Also that year, she later returned to the stage with &quot;In the Boom Boom Room&quot; as a go-go dancer. She had wanted to play this role since 1972 when the play originally premiered on Broadway, but she lost the role to Madeline Kahn. Although she wasn&#x27;t cast in David Rabe’s play, she later married him in 1979.

Her back-to-back success with &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; and &quot;Starting Over&quot; led writer Mel Gussow to suggest that Clayburgh was one of the few &quot;stars for the 80&#x27;s, fresh, natural anti‐ingenues&quot; alongside Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, adding, &quot;These are stage actresses who have become movie stars on their own terms, free of “glamour,” ready to clown as well as to play heroines.&quot; In 1980, she was cast opposite Michael Douglas in a romantic comedy, &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn&quot;, in which she teaches the proof of the snake lemma. Novelist Eleanor Bergstein, who had written the screenplay, was delighted with Clayburgh&#x27;s casting. “To me,” says Bergstein, “Jill is one of the few actresses who looks like she has imagined her life, made her life happen. I think that divides women in a way, women whose intelligence animates their faces. They have willed themselves to be beautiful, to be exactly who they are. Their minds inform their faces. I think Jill is like that. Lots of actresses are just the opposite.” Clayburgh herself was attracted to the part because “Kate is the closest person to myself that I have ever played. People always say, ‘Oh, &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;, that’s you.&#x27; But really, of course, it’s not.” The following year, she was a conservative Supreme Court justice in &quot;First Monday in October&quot;, a comedy with Walter Matthau. Her performance was praised and earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical.

===Career setbacks and TV films===
By the mid-1980s, Clayburgh appeared in fewer and less successful films, despite turning to more dramatic material. She played a valium addict and documentarist in &quot;I&#x27;m Dancing as Fast as I Can&quot; (1981), written by David Rabe, her husband. &quot;I guess people look at me and they think I&#x27;m a ladylike character,&quot; said Clayburgh, &quot;but it&#x27;s not what I do best. I do best with characters who are coming apart at the seams.&quot; The film received negative reviews, but Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; liked Clayburgh&#x27;s performance and wrote that she played her high-powered career woman &quot;earnestly and vigorously.&quot; In the controversial &quot;Hanna K.&quot; (1983), she was a court-appointed Israeli-American lawyer assigned to defend a Palestinian man for director Costa-Gavras. The film was a box office failure and hurt her career. Upset by the film&#x27;s reception, Clayburgh gave up cinema for three years, during which time she was busy bringing up her children.

Alongside then-rising stars Raúl Julia and Frank Langella, Clayburgh returned to Broadway for a revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1984–85), directed by George C. Scott, which ran for 245 performances. Writing for the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, John Beaufort wrote, &quot;Jill Clayburgh&#x27;s Gilda is not merely sexy and volatile. She can be sweetly feminine. She is a woman struggling both to find herself and to discover where she belongs in this triangle. In more than one respect, Miss Clayburgh grasps the deeper as well as the more superficially amusing aspects of her dilemma.&quot;

As her feature film career waned, Clayburgh began accepting roles in television films, including &quot;Where Are the Children?&quot; (1986) as a divorcée who gets revenge on her ex-spouse, and &quot;Miles to Go...&quot; (1986). She returned to film in 1987 when she drew praise for portraying a shallow, sophisticated Manhattan magazine writer in Andrei Konchalovsky&#x27;s little-seen independent film &quot;Shy People&quot;; although the film flopped, this was her most substantial film role after &quot;Hanna K&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; found her &quot;amusing&quot; while Ebert called Clayburgh&#x27;s work &quot;sadly overlooked&quot; and her &quot;other best role&quot; after &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;.

After &quot;Shy People&quot;, Clayburgh took on a series of roles in the television films &quot;Who Gets the Friends?&quot; (1988) and &quot;Fear Stalk&quot; (1989), in which she portrayed a budding cartoonist and a strong-willed soap opera producer, respectively. She then played an investigator studying a child-abuse case in &quot;Unspeakable Acts&quot; (1990). In 1991, Clayburgh earned decent reviews for her role as English actress and singer Jill Ireland in the television biopic &quot;Reason for Living: The Jill Ireland Story&quot; (1991), which detailed Ireland&#x27;s struggle to beat cancer and to help her adopted son get past his heroin addiction. Although Clayburgh never met Ireland, she read her book and listened to taped interviews with her in preparation. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Clayburgh&#x27;s accent in &quot;Reason for Living&quot;, writing, &quot;Quite aside from her smooth assurance, Clayburgh pulls off Ireland&#x27;s English accent without calling attention to herself.&quot; This performance led &quot;The New York Times&quot; to write that her small-screen work was &quot;a sign of the times: older actresses accustomed to playing strong roles are finding their best work [in film] on television.&quot;

Gradually, Clayburgh shifted into being more of a supporting character actress in the 1990s, taking on roles as diverse as an antagonistic judge in &quot;Trial: The Price of Passion&quot; (1992) and the interfering wife of Alan Alda&#x27;s character in &quot;Whispers in the Dark&quot; (1992). After appearing in Ben Gazzara&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Ocean&quot; (1990), which was shot in Bali, and the unreleased &quot;Pretty Hattie&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1991), she became typecast as an attractive maternal figure: she was the long-missing matriarch in &quot;Rich in Love&quot; (1992), a wheelchair-user mother in &quot;Firestorm: 72 Hours in Oakland&quot; (1993), and Eric Stoltz&#x27;s single mother in &quot;Naked in New York&quot; (1993). A review in &quot;People&quot; magazine felt Clayburgh &quot;[did] her best as the footloose mother&quot; in &quot;Rich in Love&quot;, while Roger Ebert praised her casting in &quot;Naked in New York&quot; as &quot;exactly on target&quot;. She also played Kitty Menendez, who was murdered by her sons, in &quot;Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders&quot; (1993), a role which &quot;Variety&quot; perceived to be &quot;incomplete, but that has more to do with the script than Clayburgh’s performance.&quot; She continued to play concerned, protective mothers in &quot;For the Love of Nancy&quot; (1994), &quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot; (1995), &quot;Going All the Way&quot; (1997), &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; (1997), &quot;When Innocence Is Lost&quot; (1997) and &quot;Sins of the Mind&quot; (1997), and was in &quot;good form&quot; as the forceful, pushy stage mother in &quot;Crowned and Dangerous&quot; (1997).

In the late 1990s, Clayburgh guest-starred on episodes of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;, and starred in another short-lived sitcom, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Relative&quot; (1999), and a short-lived series, &quot;Trinity&quot; (1999).

===Later career and final roles===
After appearing in &quot;My Little Assassin&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; (2000), she had her first prominent lead role since &quot;Hanna K.&quot; and &quot;Shy People&quot; in Eric Schaeffer&#x27;s comedy &quot;Never Again&quot; (2001). Roger Ebert praised Clayburgh &quot;for do[ing] everything humanly possible to create a character who is sweet and believable&quot; and called it &quot;a reminder of Clayburgh&#x27;s gifts as an actress&quot;, while Stephen Holden of the &quot;New York Times&quot; credited her for lending &quot;emotional weight&quot; to the part of &quot;a desperately lonely 54-year-old single mother.&quot; Also in 2001, she appeared in &quot;Falling&quot; and had a semi-recurring role on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; as Ally&#x27;s mother and on &quot;The Practice&quot;, before becoming a regular in another short-lived show, &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; (2002).

She returned to off-Broadway as a falsely convicted mother-of-two in Bob Balaban&#x27;s production of &quot;The Exonerated&quot; (2002–04) with Richard Dreyfuss. Writing for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, Charles Isherwood commended Clayburgh for playing her part &quot;with clear-eyed dignity.&quot; She then appeared in &quot;Phenomenon II&quot; (2003) and received an Emmy nomination for guest appearances in the series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; in 2005. That year she continued her resurgent stage career in &quot;A Naked Girl on the Appian Way&quot;, which ran for 69 performances. More successful was &quot;The Busy World is Hushed&quot; (2005–06) on off-Broadway, where she replaced Christine Lahti and played a widowed Episcopal minister and scholar. &quot;Variety&quot; critic David Rooney praised Clayburgh&#x27;s &quot;wisdom and quiet humor while refusing to define Hannah’s questionable behavior and convictions as right or wrong, sound or unsound&quot; and her &quot;embrace of the woman’s uncertainties, mak[ing] her all the more human.&quot;

In 2006, she appeared on Broadway in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; with Patrick Wilson and Amanda Peet; she played Peet&#x27;s mother, a role originated by Mildred Natwick. It ran for 109 performances and was met with mixed reviews. Still, Clayburgh&#x27;s performance drew praise and the &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Ben Brantley lauded &quot;her winning way with dialogue that can make synthetic one-liners sound like filigree epigrams. Trim and dazzlingly blond, she is a glamorous eyeful in Isaac Mizrahi&#x27;s rich dowager costumes.&quot; She returned to the screen that same year as a therapist&#x27;s eccentric wife in Ryan Murphy&#x27;s all-star ensemble dramedy &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;, an autobiographical tale of teenage angst and dysfunction based on the book by Augusten Burroughs; also starring Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow and Evan Rachel Wood, Clayburgh&#x27;s supporting performance earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination by the St. Louis Gateway Film Critics Association. By the end of 2006, Clayburgh played a wistful eccentric in what was her last stage appearance, &quot;The Clean House&quot; (2006–07) on off-Broadway, and was praised for her &quot;goofy lightness&quot; by &quot;The Post Gazette&quot;.

During 2007–2009, Clayburgh appeared in the ABC television series &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot;, playing the wealthy socialite Letitia Darling. She then played Jake Gyllenhaal&#x27;s mother in Edward Zwick&#x27;s &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot; (2010) and Kristen Wiig&#x27;s mother in Paul Feig&#x27;s acclaimed blockbuster comedy &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; (2011), which was the last film that Clayburgh completed.

==Death==
Clayburgh died at her home in Lakeville, Connecticut, on November 5, 2010, after privately battling chronic lymphocytic leukemia for more than two decades.

==Personal life==
As a teenager, Clayburgh had two back-alley abortions, which she chronicled in the 1991 book &quot;The Choices We Made: Twenty-Five Women and Men Speak Out About Abortion&quot;. Clayburgh dated actor Al Pacino from 1967 to 1972. She married screenwriter and playwright David Rabe in 1979. They had two children: a son, Michael Rabe, and a daughter, the actress Lily Rabe.

<text>GoboLinux is a Linux distribution whose most prominent feature is a reorganization of the traditional Linux file system. Rather than following the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard like most Unix-like systems, each program in a GoboLinux system has its own subdirectory tree, where all of its files (including settings specific for that program) may be found. Thus, a program &quot;Foo&quot; has all of its specific files and libraries in codice_1, under the corresponding version of this program at hand. For example, the commonly known GCC compiler suite version 8.1.0, would reside under the directory codice_2.

According to the GoboLinux developers, this results in a cleaner system.

== Overview ==
The GoboLinux hierarchy represents a radical departure from the filesystem traditionally employed by most UNIX-like operating systems where specific types of files are stored together in common standard subdirectories (such as codice_3 for executables and codice_4 for configuration files) and where package managers are used to keep track of what file belongs to which program. In GoboLinux, files from each program are placed under their respective program&#x27;s own dedicated subdirectory. The makers of GoboLinux have said that &quot;the filesystem is the package manager&quot;, and the GoboLinux package system uses the filesystem itself as a package database. This is said to produce a more straightforward, less cluttered directory tree. GoboLinux uses symlinks and an optional kernel module called &quot;GoboHide&quot; to achieve all this while maintaining full compatibility with the traditional Linux filesystem hierarchy.

The creators of GoboLinux have stated that their design has other &quot;modernisms&quot;, such as the removal of some distinctions between similar traditional directories (such as the locations of executables codice_3, codice_6, and codice_7). GoboLinux designers have claimed that this results in shell scripts breaking less often than with other Linux distributions. This change, introduced by GoboLinux in 2003, has only been adopted by other distributions much later: Fedora merged /bin and /usr/bin in 2012; Debian enabled the /usr merge by default in 2018.

GoboLinux also allows the user to have different versions of the same program installed concurrently (and even run them concurrently). Furthermore, it has been claimed that the package management index could never become unsynchronized with the filesystem, because references to nonexistent files simply become broken links, and thus become inactive. GoboLinux&#x27;s filesystem changes also allow other innovations, such as an entirely different scripts-based boot system that does not use System V or BSD style init systems or one of their replacements.

== File hierarchy ==
The design of GoboLinux was influenced by earlier systems such as NeXTSTEP, AtheOS, and BeOS, all of which adopted original filesystem structures while still maintaining a considerable degree of compatibility with Unix. At the root of the GoboLinux tree, there are five directories: Programs, Users, System, Data, and Mount.

== &quot;Compile&quot; program==

Compile is a program that downloads, unpacks, compiles source code tarballs, and installs the resulting executable code, all with a single command (such as codice_8) using simple compilation scripts known as &quot;recipes&quot;.

The Compile system is somewhat similar to Gentoo&#x27;s system, which is based on the FreeBSD Ports collection. However, Portage is made for a traditional filesystem hierarchy, compatible with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, while Compile extends the capability of GoboLinux&#x27;s distinctive filesystem hierarchy into the area of package management. Thus, in GoboLinux, the filesystem itself serves naturally as a kind of package manager database.

The Compile program was introduced in GoboLinux version 011. Before that, there were discussions about porting Gentoo&#x27;s Portage system to GoboLinux and developing the port as a SourceForge.net project under the name &quot;GoboPortage&quot;.

Compile&#x27;s other features included:
; The use of each program&#x27;s own download site
: The distribution&#x27;s repository (or one of its mirrors) is only used for downloading recipes. Recipes may be downloaded on-the-fly or in batch.
; Minimalistic and declarative-oriented compilation scripts
: Typical &quot;configure; make; make install&quot; software may be scripted in two lines, greatly easing maintenance.
; Support of GoboLinux-style dependencies
: Software compiled &quot;by hand&quot; by the user is taken into account by a detection mechanism.
; Path-agnosticism
: It also works in a rootless GoboLinux installation (that is, inside a home directory of any other distribution).

== Releases ==
Releases have been numbered using the octal base system. According to the authors, this scheme was chosen because it keeps the typical leading zero that is present in many free software version numbers (since a leading zero often indicates that a number is octal), and it is a play on the &quot;version numbers race&quot; that happened among Linux distributions around 1999. When read as decimal numbers, using octal numbers causes a deterministic &quot;version bump&quot; each eight releases. Up to version 013, GoboLinux made no &quot;point releases&quot;, in order to avoid the implication that some releases were more stable than others. This tradition was broken with version 014.01, an update of 014 focused on bug fixes.

== Ports ==
GoboLinux is currently developed for x86-64. It was officially made for the i686 only until release 015, but at one point an incomplete port to the i386 was made. Ports have also been made to embedded architectures, such as ARM and SuperH; these tasks were achieved with Bootstrap, a tool developed especially to automate making ports.

== Reception ==
LWN.net reviewed GoboLinux 010 in 2004:

Linux.com wrote review about GoboLinux 013:

Jesse Smith from DistroWatch Weekly reviewed GoboLinux 015:

Smith also reviewed GoboLinux 016.

== Name and logo ==
&quot;Gobo&quot; is a fictional character. &lt;q&gt;Not much is known about him, because those who saw him never survived to tell information about him.&lt;/q&gt; He also has a fictional loyal servant named &quot;Fibo&quot;. GoboLinux&#x27;s mascot &quot;Que&quot; is a penguin wearing Fibo&#x27;s clothes.

<text>Naushad Ali (25 December 1919 – 5 May 2006) was an Indian composer for Hindi films. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest and foremost music directors of the Hindi film industry. He is particularly known for popularising the use of classical music in films.

His first film as an independent music director was &quot;Prem Nagar&quot; in 1940. His first musically successful film was &quot;Rattan&quot; (1944), followed by 35 silver jubilee hits, 12 golden jubilee and 3 diamond jubilee mega successes. Naushad was conferred the Dadasaheb Phalke Award and the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and 1992 respectively for his contribution to the Hindi film industry.

==Early life and education==
Naushad Ali was born and raised in Lucknow, a city with a long tradition as a centre of Indian Muslim culture. His father, Wahid Ali, was a munshi (court clerk). As a child, Naushad would visit the annual fair at the Deva Sharif in Barabanki, 25 km from Lucknow, where all the great qawwals and musicians of those days would perform before the devotees. He studied Hindustani music there under Ustad Ghurbat Ali, Ustad Yusuf Ali, Ustad Babban Saheb and others. He also repaired harmoniums.

As a lad, he joined a junior theatrical club and was appointed the club&#x27;s music maestro for their theatrical presentations. He used to watch silent films at the Royal theatre in Lucknow. Theatre owners would hire a team of musicians to play the tabla, harmonium, sitar and violin. The musicians would watch the film first, make notes, finalize the scales required. When the show began in the evening, they would sit in front of the screen and play music for the scenes. This was a great way to be entertained and learn music at the same time. It made him grasp the nuances required in composing a film&#x27;s background music score.

In time Naushad formed his own Windsor Music Entertainers or just Windsor Entertainers, so named because he had seen the word &quot;Windsor&quot; around Lucknow and liked its ring. It led to the Indian Star Theatrical Company in a theatre at Golaganj colony in Lucknow. He was trained under Laddan Khan until he became capable of working independently as a composer. There he also developed the sense to pick rare musical jewels from the folk tradition of Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Saurashtra during the company&#x27;s sojourns in those regions. The travelling players got as far as Viramgam in Gujarat, where they discovered penury, even after selling off theatrical props and musical instruments. The company limped back to Lucknow through the kindness of one of Naushad&#x27;s friends.

Naushad had already become a cinema fan in the silent era and then, in 1931, Indian cinema got voice and music that further fascinated the 13-year-old boy. He learnt classical and folk music against the wishes of his father. He moved to Mumbai in late 1937 for a career as a musician.

==Career==
In Mumbai, he initially stayed with an acquaintance from Lucknow (U.P.) at Colaba and after a while, shifted to Dadar opposite the Broadway theatre where he would sleep on the footpath. He assisted music director Ustad Jhande Khan who was at the peak of his success those days, at a monthly salary of Rs 40.

Then he worked on a film with a Russian producer with the studio located at Chembur. This film could not be completed. Naushad was a piano player so he worked as a pianist in composer Ustad Mushtaq Hussain&#x27;s orchestra. He then polished off an unfinished film score and got a credit as assistant to Mushtaq Hussain. Then the film company collapsed. Composer Khemchand Prakash took him on as his assistant for the film &quot;Kanchan&quot; at Ranjit Studios at a salary of Rs 60 per month, for which Naushad remained extremely grateful and in interviews, he had called Khemchand his guru.

His friend, lyricist D. N. Madhok, trusted Naushad&#x27;s unusual talent for composing music and introduced him to various film producers. Chandulal Shah, the owner of Ranjit Studios, offered to sign Naushad for one of his forthcoming films. Naushad composed a thumri for this film, &quot;Bata de koi kaun gali gaye Shyam&quot;, but the film never went into production. He was assistant music director for the Punjabi film &quot;Mirza Sahib&quot; (1939).

He composed for his first independent film &quot;Prem Nagar&quot; in 1940 that had a story set in Kutch for which he did a lot of research into the folk music of the area. With A.R. Kardar&#x27;s film &quot;Nayi Duniya&quot; (1942), he got first credit as &quot;music director&quot; and he began to work regularly for Kardar Productions. He, however, had a flexibility that he could work outside Kardar Productions and this arrangement continued throughout his career. He first got noticed with A.R. Kardar&#x27;s film &quot;Sharda&quot; (1942) wherein 13-year-old Suraiya debuted with the song &quot;Panchhi Ja&quot; for the playback for heroine Mehtab. It was Rattan (1944) that took Naushad right to the top and enabled him to charge Rs 25,000 a film during those days.

Film expert and author Rajesh Subramanian opines that Kardar productions spent Rupees seventy five thousand in 1944 to make &quot;Rattan&quot;. The music by Naushad saheb was such a phenomenal hit that the company earned Rs 3 lacs as royalty from gramophone sales in the first year.

But his Lucknow-based family remained against music and Naushad had to hide from his family the fact that he composed music. When Naushad got married, the band was playing the tunes of the super hit songs of Naushad&#x27;s film &#x27;Rattan&#x27;. While Naushad&#x27;s father and father-in-law were condemning the musician who had composed these songs, Naushad dared not tell them that it was he who had composed the music. Naushad understood Hindu and Muslim culture and the languages of those cultures.

From 1942 until the late 1960s, he was one of the top music directors in Hindi films. While he did 65 films during his lifetime, 26 of those films celebrated Silver jubilees (25 weeks run) – 8 celebrated golden jubilees (50 weeks run) and 4 celebrated diamond jubilees (60 weeks run) – (inclusive count – a diamond jubilee film also celebrates Silver and Golden jubilees).

Naushad worked with several lyricists, including Shakeel Badayuni, Majrooh Sultanpuri, D. N. Madhok, Zia Sarhadi, Yusufali Kechery and Khumar Barabankvi.

Mother India (1957), for which he had composed music, was the first Indian film that got nominated for an Oscar award.

In 1981, Naushad was awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for his lifetime contribution to Indian cinema.

He composed the tunes of &quot;Taj Mahal: An Eternal Love Story&quot; (2005) at the age of 86.

Amongst his assistants, Mohammed Shafi, Jerry Amaldev and Ghulam Mohammed stand out prominently.

The songs Naushad composed for the 1988 Malayalam film Dhwani which were sung by P. Susheela &amp; K. J. Yesudas are evergreen superhits that Malayalis do repeatedly listen to even after 3 decades.

Five films have been made on his life and work. Biographical books published are Dastaan-E-Naushad (Marathi) by Shashikant Kinikar; Aaj Gaawat Man Mero (Gujarati); Hindi and Urdu biographical sketches in Shama &amp; Sushma Magazines respectively, titled &quot;Naushad Ki Kahani, Naushad Ki Zubani&quot;; the last one was translated into Marathi by Shashikant Kinikar. Kinikar also came up with a book titled &quot;Notes of Naushad&quot; which puts together some interesting anecdotes of Naushad&#x27;s life.

Naushad also composed background music for the TV serial &quot;Akbar The Great&quot; telecast in 1988 which was directed by Akbar Khan, brother of Hindi film stars Sanjay Khan and Feroze Khan as was also The Sword of Tipu Sultan produced and directed by Sanjay Khan and Akbar Khan which was telecast in 1990 and became very popular.

===Death and legacy===
Naushad died on 5 May 2006 in Mumbai due to cardiac arrest at age 86. He was buried at the Juhu Muslim cemetery.

He is survived by six daughters Zubeda, Fehmida, Farida, Sayeeda, Rashida, and Waheeda and three sons Rehman Naushad, Raju Naushad &amp; Iqbal Naushad. Rehman Naushad being the eldest of all assisted him in some of his films. Also, Naushad composed music for two movies directed by Rahman Naushad, &quot;My Friend&quot; (1974) and &quot;Teri Payal Mere Geet&quot; (1989).

Naushad was ranked as one of the most respected and successful music directors of Indian Film Industry.

Naushad had requested the Maharashtra State Government to sanction a plot for an institution for promoting Hindustani music. This was sanctioned during his lifetime and the &#x27;Naushad Academy of Hindustani Sangeet&#x27; was formed.

==Writer==
Naushad was also a respected and published poet and formally launched his book of Urdu poetry entitled Aathwaan Sur (&quot;The Eighth Note&quot;) and the Navras label&#x27;s album titled &quot;Aathwan Sur – The Other Side of Naushad&quot; having 8 ghazals as part of Hounslow&#x27;s book fair and festival &quot;Bookmela&quot; in November 1998. The album has lyrics and composition by Naushad, arranged by Uttam Singh.

==Music style==
Naushad gave a new trend to popular film music by basing his tunes on classical music ragas and folk music. Bhairavi (Hindustani) is his favourite Raga Naushad was known for his skillful adaptation of the classical musical tradition for movie songs. Among all contemporary singer, Naushad Ali gave numbers of the songs to Mohammad Rafi. Most of Naushad Ali popular songs are sung by Mohammad Rafi.
For some movies like &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot;, he composed all scores in classical raga modes and arranged for the well-known vocalist Amir Khan to be a music consultant for this film. Naushad could easily work with Western instruments, including the clarinet, the mandolin and the accordion. He could incorporate Western musical idioms in his compositions and compose for Western-style orchestras.

During the early 1940s, recordings were done in quiet parks and gardens after midnight because the studios did not have sound-proof recording rooms. In the gardens, there would be no echo and disturbances, unlike the studios where the sound reverberated because of the tin roofs.

For films like &#x27;Uran Khatola&#x27; and &#x27;Amar&#x27;, he recorded the voice of a particular artiste on a scale of 90, then recorded it on 70, then on 50 and so on. After the complete recording, it was played for the scene and the impact it created was terrific.

He was one of the first to introduce sound mixing and the separate recording of voice and music tracks in playback singing. He was the first to combine the flute and the clarinet, the sitar and mandolin. He also introduced the accordion to Hindi film music and was among the first to focus on background music to extend characters&#x27; moods and dialogue through music. But perhaps his greatest contribution was to bring Indian classical music into the film medium. Many of his compositions were inspired by ragas and he even used distinguished classical artistes like Amir Khan and D.V. Paluskar in &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot; (1952) and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan in &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960). &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot; (1952) demonstrated Naushad&#x27;s grasp of classical music and his ability to bring it to the masses, for which he won the first Filmfare Best Music Director Award in 1954.

Naushad commented on a pre-release meeting about &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot;:
&quot;When people heard that the film would be full of classical music and ragas, they protested, &#x27;People will get a headache and they will run away.&#x27; I was adamant. I wanted to change public taste. Why should people be fed what they like all the time? We presented them with music from our culture and it worked&quot;.

For Aan (1952), he was the first to use a 100-piece orchestra. He was the first composer to have developed the system of western notation in India. The notation for the music of the film &#x27;Aan&#x27; was published in book form in London.

In Uran Khatola (1955), he recorded an entire song without the use of orchestra, having replaced the sound of musical instruments with choral sound of humming.

For Mughal-e-Azam (1960) song Ae Mohabbat Zindabad, he used a chorus of 100 persons.

For Ganga Jamuna (1961), he used lyrics in chaste Bhojpuri dialect.

He used just six instruments in the title song of Mere Mehboob (1963).

In 2004, a colorized version of the classic Mughal-e-Azam (1960) was released, for which Naushad had the orchestral music specially re-created (in Dolby Digital) by today&#x27;s industry musicians, while maintaining all the solo vocals from the original soundtrack. To elaborate, the playback vocals (though not the chorus) recorded four decades ago are mixed with orchestra tracks created in the present millennium.

As Indian film music gradually assumed a Western bend starting in the late 1960s, Naushad came to be considered old-fashioned. Composers who could compose rock-and-roll and disco-inflected music started getting increasingly popular. Naushad was still esteemed as a maestro, but his talents were sought mostly for historical movies where traditional scores were appropriate. It can be said of Naushad that in the early days of popular cinema music in the thirties and forties he set the standards for classical and folk music that resonated with the idea of India. In short he brought out the beauty of Indian music in a short film song of a few minutes which was not an easy feat. The composers who followed him were inspired by this aspect of his compositions.

<text>The Republic Aviation Corporation was an American aircraft manufacturer based in Farmingdale, New York, on Long Island. Originally known as the Seversky Aircraft Company, the company was responsible for the design and production of many important military aircraft, including its most famous products: World War II&#x27;s P-47 Thunderbolt fighter, the F-84 Thunderjet and F-105 Thunderchief jet fighters.

==History==

===Seversky Aircraft===
The Seversky Aircraft Company was founded in 1931 by Alexander de Seversky, a Russian expatriate and veteran World War I pilot who had lost a leg in the war. In the beginning, many of Seversky Aircraft&#x27;s designers were Russian and Georgian engineers, including Michael Gregor and Alexander Kartveli, who would go on to design many of Republic&#x27;s most famous aircraft.

After several failed attempts, Seversky Aircraft finally won a design competition for a new United States Army Air Corps fighter, and was awarded its first military contract in 1936 for the production of its Seversky P-35.

In 1939, Seversky Aircraft again entered in a military fighter competition, this time with the much-improved AP-4. While the contract was awarded to the Curtiss P-40, the USAAC was impressed with the high-altitude performance of the AP-4 and ordered 13 additional aircraft for testing, as the XP-43.

By April 1939, the Seversky Aircraft Corporation had lost $550,000, and Seversky was forced out of the company he had founded. The board, led by financier Paul Moore, voted W. Wallace Kellett to replace him as president, and in September 1939 the company was reorganized as the Republic Aviation Corporation. Seversky continued to fight for his company, and the matter was not resolved to his satisfaction until September 1942.

Meanwhile, Seversky&#x27;s AP-4 continued in development, finally going into production as the P-43 Lancer. 272 P-43s were eventually produced, with 108 of them being sent to China to be used against the Japanese. Many passed through the hands of the AVG Flying Tigers, whose pilots were pleased with the plane&#x27;s performance at altitudes up to , while their P-40s were ineffective at altitudes over . Perhaps Claire Chennault disliked the early P-43&#x27;s lack of self-sealing fuel tanks and armor. He declined to retain the plane for his crews.

In 1939, both Republic and Curtiss participated in an Army competition to develop a lightweight interceptor. Curtiss submitted a lightweight version of the P-40 designated the XP-46 while Republic submitted a similar design designated the XP-47. Both designs were based on a lightweight aircraft built around an Allison V-1710 V-12 engine, with the Republic design using a turbosupercharger. In the end, neither design showed a significant improvement over the P-40, and neither was produced.

Further development of the P-43 continued in the form of a lightweight version using a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2180 radial engine. The resulting aircraft was known as the XP-44. When the R-2180 did not produce the expected horsepower, Republic switched to the Wright R-2600. Despite possessing , this engine could not be turbo-supercharged and Republic finally modified the design again, this time to accommodate the enormous Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engine, which produced . The resulting aircraft, now known as the P-44, was truly impressive. Capable of speeds of at , and a climb rate of per minute, the aircraft would have been an exceptional interceptor. Unfortunately, it was capable of carrying no more fuel than the P-43, and the Double Wasp engine was far more thirsty, significantly limiting the aircraft&#x27;s range.

As the air war in Europe progressed, the Army was discovering that what it really needed was a long-range fighter capable of escorting bombers into Germany. Alexander Kartveli was called to the Army&#x27;s Experimental Aircraft division and told of the new requirements, and that the P-44 would not be ordered in its current configuration. This was a devastating setback for Kartveli and Republic Aircraft because Kartveli knew the XP-44 could not be redesigned to meet these new requirements. On the train back to New York City, he began sketching a new design. This aircraft would become the P-47 Thunderbolt.

===P-47 Thunderbolt===
The USAAF refused to give Republic any money for the development of the new XP-47B, so Republic paid for the construction of the first mock-up, reusing the cockpit area of the P-43. By the time the prototype was ready for testing, it weighed over 12,550 lb, over the Army&#x27;s limit for the new fighter design, and far more than any single-engine fighter ever developed. It also could carry only 298 gallons of fuel, 17 gallons less than the requirement, but the Army was generally pleased with its performance, achieving speeds of at , and overlooked these issues.

The U.S. entry into the war in December 1941 rapidly increased the need for the XP-47B and work on the plane progressed quickly. In June 1942, the Army took delivery of its first P-47Bs. They soon placed an order that required Republic Aviation to quadruple the size of their factory and build three new runways at the Farmingdale, New York factory. Eventually this proved inadequate, and in November 1942, the Army authorized the construction of a new factory adjacent to the Evansville, Indiana airport.

Throughout the war, the P-47 would undergo constant development. A bubble canopy was added to increase rearward visibility. The final version of the P-47 would be the P-47N, a long-range version with longer wings and fuselage, and an increased fuel capacity. The P-47N was designed to escort B-29s on long missions to Japan for a planned invasion of the Japanese homeland that never came. Production of all versions ended in November 1945. By then, 15,660 P-47s had been built, making it the most produced U.S. fighter of the war. Of those, 1,816 would be the long-range P-47N model. This model would continue to serve with Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units until the mid-1950s. Republic ranked 24th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.

===RC-3 Seabee===
In 1946, Republic temporarily left the field of military contracts to produce the Republic RC-3 Seabee, an unusual all-metal amphibian. The Seabee was the brainchild of Percival &quot;Spence&quot; Spencer, a former Republic P-47 test pilot. He convinced the Republic board of the need for a light sport plane to meet a demand for private aircraft from pilots returning from World War II. The expected sales of 5,000 Seabees a year never materialized, as most returning pilots never flew again, though Republic did manage to sell 1,060 Seabees in two years of production. This was a respectable number at a time when many small aircraft manufacturers were producing only a handful of aircraft before going bankrupt. Much of this was due to the Seabee&#x27;s remarkably low price of just $3,500 to $6,000.

===F-84 family===
In 1946, Republic again turned its attention to military contracts, developing a single-engine jet fighter to meet an Army requirement for a fighter with a top speed of . The first YP-84A Thunderjet flew on February 28, 1946, but the aircraft was plagued with so many developmental problems that the first F-84B didn&#x27;t enter Air Force service until 1949. The straight-wing F-84D would go on to become an important aircraft during the Korean War, flying 86,408 missions. In 1949, a swept-wing version, the F-84F Thunderstreak, was developed but additional development and engine problems resulted in the aircraft not entering service until 1954. A photo-reconnaissance version known as the RF-84F Thunderflash was developed from the F-84F, and 715 were produced. The final straight-wing version, known as the F-84G, was a holdover design for Republic while the J-65 engine for the swept wing F-84F was still being developed. The F-84F would continue in service with Air National Guard units until 1971, when corrosion forced them to be withdrawn from U.S. service. The F-84F and RF-84F were both used by several foreign operators including Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Denmark (one squadron of RF-84F that were phased out in 1971). The F-84F continued to serve in European air forces until the 1980s.

===F-105 Thunderchief===
In 1951, Alexander Kartveli began to design a replacement for the F-84 Thunderjet. The new aircraft would be a single-engine fighter, but larger than any single-engine fighter ever designed for the Air Force. By the time the mock-up was completed in October 1953, the aircraft had grown so large that a more powerful engine was needed; the Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 was finally selected. On June 28, 1954, the Air Force placed an order for 15 of the new F-105A Thunderchief. The aircraft weighed , but could carry up to of bombs and missiles, and could fly at Mach 1 at sea level and Mach 2 at altitude. Although it had only one engine, the F-105 could carry a larger bomb load than a four-engine World War II bomber, and travel a greater distance at much higher speed. The F-105 would become the primary ground attack aircraft of the Vietnam War, flying over 20,000 missions until replaced by the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in November 1970. Of the 833 F-105s produced, 397 were lost during the Vietnam War. Seventeen were shot down by North Vietnamese MiGs, while most of the rest were lost to ground fire. The F-105 was Republic Aviation&#x27;s last independent design.

A two-seat version, the F-105G, known as &quot;Wild Weasel&quot;, was later developed to replace the &quot;Wild Weasel&quot; version of the F-100. The first F-105G flew on January 15, 1966, and deliveries began arriving in Southeast Asia in June 1966. This version continued operating in theater long after the ground attack versions had been withdrawn and was still in service at the end of the war.

===The final years===
In December 1957, Republic developed a helicopter division, building the French Aérospatiale Alouette II helicopter under license, with marginal sales success.

In an effort to keep the company going, Republic proposed converting a wartime-developed four-engine reconnaissance aircraft (the XF-12 Rainbow) into a transport aircraft. The aircraft would be very fast for a prop plane, but interest from airlines was not sufficient to continue development of the aircraft and the project was cancelled.

Republic Aviation made one last attempt to survive by returning to military contracts. In 1960, Republic Aviation acquired a minority interest in the Dutch aircraft company Fokker, and attempted to market a Fokker-designed attack plane (Fokker/Republic D-24 Alliance variable sweep wing VTOL) to the Air Force, but the Air Force showed little interest in the foreign design and no contracts were offered.

In the early 1960s, the aerospace company Fairchild, owned by Sherman Fairchild, began purchasing Republic&#x27;s stock and finally acquired Republic Aviation in July 1965. In September, Republic became the Republic Aviation Division of Fairchild Hiller and ceased to exist as an independent company.

Republic&#x27;s naming system was carried forward by Fairchild Hiller with the A-10 Thunderbolt II, which first flew in May 1972.

===Legacy===
In addition to the continued front-line use of the A-10, a number of flying and static restorations have served to sustain public awareness of Republic&#x27;s role in aviation history. The American Airpower Museum, which is based on the former Republic factory site in Farmingdale, New York, maintains a collection of Republic artifacts, historic facilities, and an array of aircraft spanning the history of the company. The museum counts itself among the few worldwide that actually maintain and fly historic aircraft, and it counts an original Republic P-47D fighter among its airworthy fleet. The museum&#x27;s static displays include a Republic F-84 first generation jet fighter, an F-84F swept-wing fighter, a rare example of the RF-84F reconnaissance variant, and an F-105 Thunderchief. In 2014, the museum added an A-10 Warthog, completing the collection of Republic fighters. The museum&#x27;s volunteer corps includes both former Republic line workers and Air Force veterans with direct Republic Aviation flight experience.

During the fall of 1987, Fairchild Corporation (then Republic&#x27;s parent company) destroyed Republic&#x27;s corporate archives. Joshua Stoff, the curator of the Cradle of Aviation Museum on Long Island, wrote in &quot;Air &amp; Space Magazine&quot; that, upon being invited to have a last look at the archives, he surreptitiously took one document with him. That lone surviving document was a contract for 225 P-47Bs from Republic for the US Army Air Corps at a cost of $16,275,657.50 (War Department Contract #15850, dated September 13, 1940). It is now housed at the museum.

The Long Island Republic Airport Historical Society, housed in the lobby of the Republic Airport Main Terminal building, maintains several photo exhibits on Republic aviation and Republic aircraft. It also maintains an extensive collection of archival photos, artifacts, corporate documents, and news articles on Republic.

<text>Libranet was an operating system based on Debian.

The last version (as of April 25, 2005) released is Libranet 3.0, which cost about $90 in US dollars for new users, or $65 for existing Libranet users. The previous version, Libranet 2.8.1, became free to download.

Development of Libranet has been discontinued.

==History==
The name comes from &quot;Libra Computer Systems&quot; (a company owned by the founder) and the fact that &quot;libra.com&quot; was taken.

The first release of Libranet was in 1999. Most Linux distributions of this time were very difficult to install, and were considered either for programmers or those who wanted a low cost server. Libranet attempted to put out and sell a distribution that was easy to install, and meant for desktop use. Corel likewise attempted this with Corel Linux, but abandoned this and refocused on software for Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. Libranet, however, continued, and developed some recognition for having a Linux distribution that was good for desktop users. Corel sold the rights to their Linux operating system to Xandros, which later released their own offering of a Linux desktop.

From 1999 to 2003, most Linux distributions with comparable desktop usability to Libranet were also priced similarly. This began to change, however, in 2004. Linux as whole had advanced, and many distributions were now reasonably easy to install, with a relatively user-friendly desktop. Some distributions such as MEPIS were competitive and far less expensive. Others such as Knoppix were offered at no cost.

Libranet attempted to carve a niche as the user-friendly Linux distro, with extensive support (termed &quot;up and running support&quot;), which, of all the desktop distros, was the most compatible with the Debian release of the time (Woody). The support offered was truly extensive: Jon Danzig, the founder, would often personally answer people&#x27;s inquiries. This helped make people who had chosen Libranet be even more loyal to it.

However, with the release of Debian &quot;Sarge&quot; in 2005, along with the emergence of Ubuntu (a Debian-based distro offered at no cost, with the option to purchase support), Libranet received less attention. Debian itself revamped their installer making it easier to use (before this, a good reason to use a Debian-based distribution was that Debian&#x27;s own installer was not user-friendly).

Libranet released version 3.0, which received good reviews, but the market had changed for desktop distributions. Various other commercial vendors had released free versions of their distributions, such as SUSE, which released OpenSUSE, and Red Hat, which released Fedora. Whereas Libranet sold their distribution, and then gave free extensive support, many distributors chose to give away their distribution and sell support, and/or sell proprietary software enhancements.

Jon Danzig, the founder of Libranet, died on June 1, 2005. His son Tal had taken over the leadership of the development team, but then stated that he would stop maintaining Libranet. Daniel de Kok, the other remaining employee, went on to become a developer for CentOS.

==Cancellation of OpenLibranet 3.1==

There were many users who were interested in seeing Libranet, and the Libranet Adminmenu software, continue to be available. Adminmenu was an operating system setup and configuration tool. It was unique in that it also contained a user-friendly kernel compiling tool. So a team including Daniel de Kok proposed to opensource Libranet and release OpenLibranet 3.1. But after failing to obtain definitive permission for this plan from Tal Danzig, the owner, the plan was dropped.

<doc id="225573" wikidata="Q2277762" url="?curid=225573" title="Bamboozled">
<text>Bamboozled is a 2000 American satirical black comedy-drama film written and directed by Spike Lee about a modern televised minstrel show featuring black actors donning blackface makeup and the resulting violent fallout from the show&#x27;s success. It features an ensemble cast including Damon Wayans, Jada Pinkett Smith, Savion Glover, Tommy Davidson, and Michael Rapaport.

The film was given a limited release by New Line Cinema during the fall of 2000 and was released on DVD the following year. Critical reception was mixed, and the film was unsuccessful financially, becoming a box office bomb. Despite its initial reception, &quot;Bamboozled&quot; later achieved cult film status for its satirical look at stereotypical depictions of black people in both historical and contemporary American film and television productions.

In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

== Plot ==

Pierre Delacroix (real name Peerless Dothan) is an uptight, Harvard-educated African-American man in the employment of television network CNS. At work, he endures torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) and the word &quot;nigger&quot; repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children with her, he is more black than Delacroix and thus can say &quot;nigger&quot;. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix&#x27;s scripts for series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as &quot;Cosby clones.&quot;

In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloan Hopkins. &quot;Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show&quot; features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped animated cartoons. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished homeless street performers, Manray and Womack, to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills.

To Delacroix&#x27;s horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as it premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as satire. Delacroix quickly embraces the fame and recognition he receives while Hopkins becomes ashamed of her association with it. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins&#x27;s older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the show&#x27;s content. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program&#x27;s live band position, the group plans to end the show using violence.

Womack quits, fed up with the show and Manray&#x27;s increasing ego. Manray and Hopkins grow closer, despite Delacroix&#x27;s attempts to sabotage their relationship. Delacroix confronts Hopkins, and when she lashes back at him, he fires her. She then shows him a videotaped montage she created of racist footage culled from assorted media to shame Delacroix into stopping production of the show, but he refuses to watch it. After an argument with Delacroix, Manray realizes he is being exploited and defiantly announces that he will no longer wear blackface. He appears in front of the studio audience, who are all in blackface, and does his dance number in his regular clothing. The network executives immediately turn against Manray, and Dunwitty fires him.

The Mau Maus kidnap Manray and announce his public execution via live webcast. The authorities work feverishly to track down the source of the internet feed, but Manray is nevertheless assassinated while doing his famous tap dancing. At his office, Delacroix (now in blackface himself, mourning Manray&#x27;s death) fantasizes that the various black-themed antique collectibles in his office are staring him down and coming to life; in a rage, he destroys many of the items. The police kill all the members of the Mau Maus except for One-Sixteenth Blak, a white member who demands to die with the others.

Furious, Hopkins confronts Delacroix at gunpoint and demands that he play her tape. As he does so, Hopkins reminds him of the lives that were ruined because of his actions. During a struggle over the gun, Delacroix is shot in the stomach. Hopkins flees while proclaiming that it was Delacroix&#x27;s own fault that he got shot. Delacroix, holding the gun in his hands to make his wound appear self-inflicted, watches the tape as he lies dying on the floor. The film concludes with a full reveal of the tape&#x27;s contents; a long montage of racially insensitive and demeaning clips of African-American characters from Hollywood films of the first half of the 20th century. Delacroix reflects on the words of James Baldwin that &quot;People pay for what they do, and still more for what they have allowed themselves to become, and they pay for it, very simply, by the lives they lead.&quot; and then reflects on his father telling him to “always keep ‘em laughing”. Afterwards, Manray is shown doing his last &quot;Mantan&quot; sequence on stage as an unseen audience laughs hysterically.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
Most of the film was shot on Mini DV digital video, using the Sony VX 1000 camera, and later converted to film format. This kept the budget limited to $10 million and allowed the use of multiple cameras to simultaneously capture masters, two-shots and close-ups to save time. The &quot;Mantan: New Millenium Minstrel Show&quot; sequences, and their sponsor ads, were shot on Super 16 film stock.

In a 2015 interview, Spike Lee credited &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; with inspiring him to make &quot;Bamboozled&quot;.

== Soundtrack ==
Bamboozled is the soundtrack album to Spike Lee&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Bamboozled&quot;. Motown Records released the album on September 26, 2000. It peaked at number 60 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Six tracks on the album were performed by future Grammy award winner India.Arie in what were her first official appearances on an album.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 53% based on reviews from 106 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;Bamboozled is too heavy-handed in its satire and comes across as more messy and overwrought than biting.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 54% based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot;

Among those who gave positive reviews to the film were CNN correspondent Dennis Michael, who compared the film favorably to Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Producers&quot; and praised Glover&#x27;s performance in the lead role, Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who described the film as &quot;savage, abrasive, audacious and confrontational&quot; and &quot;the work of a master provocateur&quot;, and Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who described the film as &quot;an almost oxymoronic entity, an important Hollywood movie.&quot; It was not reviewed as favorably by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;&#x27; Roger Ebert, who gave the film 2 stars out of a possible 4, writing that the film was &quot;perplexing,&quot; raising important issues but handling them poorly. &quot;The film is a satirical attack on the way TV uses and misuses African-American images, but many viewers will leave the theater thinking Lee has misused them himself.&quot;

By the time of its twentieth anniversary, &quot;Bamboozled&quot; had been reappraised as an underappreciated work of Lee&#x27;s. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fear noted that &quot;the really scary thing is that, 20 years on, &quot;Bamboozled&quot; feels incredibly contemporary. It doesn&#x27;t look so extreme after all...and when you consider the content of this film, that&#x27;s a very troubling thing.”

=== Box office ===
The film grossed $2,463,650 at the box office on a $10 million budget.

<text>The swordfish (Xiphias gladius), also known as the broadbill in some countries, are large, highly migratory predatory fish characterized by a long, flat, pointed bill. They are a popular sport fish of the billfish category. Swordfish are elongated, round-bodied, and lose all teeth and scales by adulthood. These fish are found widely in tropical and temperate parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and can typically be found from near the surface to a depth of , and exceptionally up to depths of 2,234 m. They commonly reach in length, and the maximum reported is in length and in weight.

They are the sole member of their family, Xiphiidae.

== Taxonomy and etymology==
The swordfish is named after its long pointed, flat bill, which resembles a sword. The species name, &quot;Xiphias gladius&quot;, derives from Greek (&quot;xiphias&quot;, &quot;swordfish&quot;), itself from (&quot;xiphos&quot;, &quot;sword&quot;) and from Latin (&quot;sword&quot;). This makes it superficially similar to other billfish such as marlin, but upon examination, their physiology is quite different and they are members of different families.

Several extinct genera are known, such as a large sized &quot;Xiphiorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Aglyptorhynchus&quot;. Unlike modern taxa these have equally long lower jaws.

==Description==
They commonly reach in length, and the maximum reported is in length and in weight. The International Game Fish Association&#x27;s all-tackle angling record for a swordfish was a specimen taken off Chile in 1953. Females are larger than males, and Pacific swordfish reach a greater size than northwest Atlantic and Mediterranean swordfish.

They reach maturity at 4–5 years of age and the maximum age is believed to be at least 9 years. The oldest swordfish found in a recent study were a 16-year-old female and 12-year-old male. Swordfish ages are derived, with difficulty, from annual rings on fin rays rather than otoliths, since their otoliths are small in size.

=== Temperature regulation ===
Swordfish are ectothermic animals. Along with some species of sharks, they have special organs next to their eyes called heater cells which function to heat their eyes and brains. Their eyes are heated to temperatures measured between 10 and 15 °C (18 and 27 °F) above the surrounding water temperature; this heating greatly improves their vision and, consequently, their predatory efficacy.

The swordfish is one of 22 species of fish – including the marlin, tuna, and some sharks – known to have a heat-conservation mechanism.

== Behavior and ecology ==
=== Movements and feeding ===
The popular image of the swordfish skewering its prey with its nose is based on little evidence. In a typical environment, swordfish most likely use their noses to slash at prey and inflict weakening injuries. The hypothesis that they may use their noses as spears in a defensive capacity against sharks and other predators is still under review.

Mainly, the swordfish relies on its great speed and agility in the water to catch its prey. It is no doubt among the fastest fish, but the basis for the frequently-quoted speed of is unreliable. Research on related marlin (&quot;Istiophorus platypterus&quot;) suggest a maximum value of is more likely.

Swordfish are not schooling fish. They swim alone or in very loose aggregations, separated by as much as from a neighboring swordfish. They are frequently found basking at the surface, airing their first dorsal fin. Boaters report this to be a beautiful sight, as is the powerful jumping for which the species is known. This jumping, also called breaching, may be an effort to dislodge pests, such as remoras or lampreys.

Swordfish prefer water temperatures between , but have the widest tolerance among billfish, and can be found from . This highly migratory species typically moves towards colder regions to feed during the summer. Swordfish feed daily, most often at night, when they rise to surface and near-surface waters in search of smaller fish. During the day, they commonly occur to depths of and have exceptionally been recorded as deep as . Adults feed on a wide range of pelagic fish, such as mackerel, barracudinas, silver hake, rockfish, herring, and lanternfishes, but they also take demersal fish, squid, and crustaceans. In the northwestern Atlantic, a survey based on the stomach content of 168 individuals found 82% had eaten squid and 53% had eaten fish, including gadids, scombrids, butterfish, bluefish, and sand lance. Large prey are typically slashed with the sword, while small are swallowed whole.

=== Threats and parasites ===
Almost 50 species of parasites have been documented in swordfish. In addition to remoras, lampreys, and cookiecutter sharks, this includes a wide range of invertebrates, such as tapeworms, roundworms, Myxozoans and copepods. A comparison of the parasites of swordfish in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean indicated that some parasites, particularly Anisakis spp. larvae identified by genetic markers, could be used as biological tags and support the existence of a Mediterranean swordfish stock.

Fully adult swordfish have few natural predators. Among marine mammals, killer whales sometimes prey on adult swordfish. It is believed that sperm whales may also prey on swordfish on rare occasions. The shortfin mako, an exceptionally fast species of shark, sometimes take on swordfish; dead or dying shortfin makos have been found with broken-off swords in their heads, revealing the danger of this type of prey. Juvenile swordfish are far more vulnerable to predation, and are eaten by a wide range of predatory fish. Intensive fishery may be driving swordfishes and sharks into harder competition for reduced amounts of prey and therefore pitting them to fight more.

Human fishery is a major predator of swordfishes. The annual reported catch in 2019 of the North Atlantic swordfish amounted to a total of .

=== Breeding ===
In the North Pacific, batch spawning mainly occurs in water warmer than during the spring and summer, and year-round in the equatorial Pacific. In the North Atlantic, spawning is known from the Sargasso Sea, and in water warmer than and less than deep. Spawning occurs from November to February in the South Atlantic off southern Brazil. Spawning is year-round in the Caribbean Sea and other warm regions of the west Atlantic.

Large females can carry more eggs than small females, and between 1 million and 29 million eggs have been recorded. The pelagic eggs measure in diameter and days after fertilization, the embryonic development occurs. The surface-living and unique-looking larvae are long at hatching. The bill is evident when the larvae reach in length.

==Fisheries==
Swordfish were harvested by a variety of methods at small scale (notably harpoon fishing) until the global expansion of long-line fishing. They have been fished widely since ancient times in places such as the Strait of Messina, where they are still fished with traditional wooden boats called feluccas and are part of the cuisine in that area.

Swordfish are vigorous, powerful fighters. Although no unprovoked attacks on humans have been reported, swordfish can be very dangerous when harpooned. They have run their swords through the planking of small boats when hurt. In 2015, a Hawaiian fisherman was killed by a swordfish after attempting to spear the animal.

== Recreational fishing ==

Recreational fishing has developed a subspecialty called swordfishing. Because of a ban on long-lining along many parts of seashore, swordfish populations are showing signs of recovery from the overfishing caused by long-lining along the coast.

Various ways are used to fish for swordfish, but the most common method is deep-drop fishing, since swordfish spend most daylight hours very deep, in the deep scattering layer. The boat is allowed to drift to present a more natural bait. Swordfishing requires strong fishing rods and reels, as swordfish can become quite large, and it is not uncommon to use or more of weight to get the baits deep enough during the day, up to is common. Night fishing baits are usually fished much shallower, often less than . Standard baits are whole mackerel, herring, mullet, bonito, or squid; one can also use live bait. Imitation squids and other imitation fish lures can also be used, and specialized lures made specifically for swordfishing often have battery-powered or glow lights. Even baits are typically presented using glow sticks or specialized deepwater-proof battery operated lights.

== As food ==


Swordfish are classified as oily fish. Many sources, including the United States Food and Drug Administration, warn about potential toxicity from high levels of methylmercury in swordfish. The FDA recommends that young children, pregnant women, and women planning to become pregnant not eat swordfish.

The flesh of some swordfish can acquire an orange tint, reportedly from their diet of shrimp or other prey. Such fish are sold as &quot;pumpkin swordfish&quot;, and command a premium over their whitish counterparts.

Swordfish is a particularly popular fish for cooking. Since swordfish are large, meat is usually sold as steaks, which are often grilled. Swordfish meat is relatively firm, and can be cooked in ways more fragile types of fish cannot (such as over a grill on skewers). The color of the flesh varies by diet, with fish caught on the East Coast of North America often being rosier.

===Kashrut===
A dispute exists as to whether swordfish should be considered a kosher fish according to the laws of kashrut. Standard Orthodox opinion is that swordfish is not kosher, while Conservative Judaism does consider swordfish kosher. All kosher fish must have both fins and scales. The Talmud and the Tosefta are believed by some to present swordfish (&quot;achsaftias&quot;) as an example of a kosher fish without scales because swordfish are born with scales they later shed once attaining a length of about 1 meter. The 17th-century Turkish Sephardi halakhic authority Rabbi Chaim ben Yisrael Benvenisti wrote that &quot;It is a widespread custom among all Jews to eat the fish with the sword, known in vernacular as fishei espada, even though it does not have any scales. Because it is said that when it comes out of the water, due to its anger, it shakes and throws off its scales.&quot; A 1933 list of kosher fish published by the Agudas HaRabbonim includes swordfish. The following year, Rabbi Yosef Kanowitz published the same list of kosher fish with swordfish still included. Swordfish was widely considered kosher by halakhic authorities until the 1950s. Orthodox opinion began to shift in 1951, when Rabbi Moshe Tendler examined swordfish and decided it was not kosher due to the lack of scales. Tendler&#x27;s opinion provoked strong debate among halakhic authorities during the 1960s. Among Mediterranean Jews there was a longstanding minhag of considering swordfish kosher. Swordfish was and possibly still is consumed by Jews in Italy, Turkey, Gibraltar, Morocco, Tunisia, and England. Due to Tendler&#x27;s opinion, swordfish are generally not considered kosher by Orthodox Jews in the United States and Israel.

== Conservation status ==

In 1998, the U.S. Natural Resources Defense Council and SeaWeb hired Fenton Communications to conduct an advertising campaign to promote their assertion that the swordfish population was in danger due to its popularity as a restaurant entree.

The resulting &quot;Give Swordfish a Break&quot; promotion was wildly successful, with 750 prominent U.S. chefs agreeing to remove North Atlantic swordfish from their menus, and also persuaded many supermarkets and consumers across the country.

The advertising campaign was repeated by the national media in hundreds of print and broadcast stories, as well as extensive regional coverage. It earned the Silver Anvil award from the Public Relations Society of America, as well as&quot; Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s award for the top five environmental stories of 1998.

Subsequently, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service proposed a swordfish protection plan that incorporated the campaign&#x27;s policy suggestions. Then-US President Bill Clinton called for a ban on the sale and import of swordfish and in a landmark decision by the federal government, of the Atlantic Ocean were placed off-limits to fishing as recommended by the sponsors.

In the North Atlantic, the swordfish stock is fully rebuilt, with biomass estimates currently 5% above the target level. No robust stock assessments for swordfish in the northwestern Pacific or South Atlantic have been made, and data concerning stock status in these regions are lacking. These stocks are considered unknown and a moderate conservation concern. The southwestern Pacific stock is a moderate concern due to model uncertainty, increasing catches, and declining catch per unit effort. Overfishing is likely occurring in the Indian Ocean, and fishing mortality exceeds the maximum recommended level in the Mediterranean, thus these stocks are considered of high conservation concern.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the swordfish to its seafood red list.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Notable incidents ===
In 2007, a fisherman died after being attacked by a swordfish which pierced his eye and its bill penetrated into the man&#x27;s skull.

In 2024, Giulia Manfrini, an Italian surfer died in a rare incident after being struck by a swordfish while surfing off the coast of West Sumatra, Indonesia.

=== In culture ===
The swordfish (&quot;Xiphias&quot;) has been used by astronomers as another name for the constellation of Dorado.

The word swordfish is used as a password in the 1932 Marx Brothers film &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;. It has since appeared as a password in many films, television series, books, and videogames.
