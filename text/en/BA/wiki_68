<text>Armand Marc, Count of Montmorin de Saint Herem (13 October 17452 September 1792) was a French statesman. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Navy under Louis XVI.

==Biography==
He belonged to a junior branch of a noble family of Auvergne. He was gentleman-in-waiting to Louis XVI when dauphin, and was subsequently appointed ambassador to Madrid. From Madrid he was suddenly summoned to the governorship of Brittany, and in 1787 was appointed by the king to succeed Vergennes in the ministry of foreign affairs. Montmorin was a devoted admirer of Jacques Necker, whose influence at court he helped maintain. He retired when Necker was dismissed on 12 July 1789, but on Necker&#x27;s recall after the storming of the Bastille again resumed his office, which he continued to hold till October 1791. Honoré Mirabeau had approached him as early as December 1788, with a plan for the policy to be pursued by the court towards the new states general; but Montmorin, offended by Mirabeau&#x27;s attacks on Necker and by his &quot;Histoire secrete de la cour de Berlin&quot;, refused to see him.

With the progress of the French Revolution, however, this attitude changed. The comte de la Marck was trying to bring Mirabeau into touch with the court, and for this purpose it was important to secure the assistance of Montmorin. The two men were soon on the closest terms. While Montmorin continued as minister in name, Mirabeau became so in fact. Montmorin did not dare to come to a decision without consulting Mirabeau, but neither Mirabeau nor La Marck were under any illusions as to his character. Mirabeau complained bitterly that Montmorin was &quot;slack&quot; (&quot;flasque&quot;) and a &quot;poltroon&quot; (&quot;gavache&quot;). La Marck thought that Montmorin&#x27;s feebleness was occasionally useful in restraining Mirabeau&#x27;s impetuosity.

The death of Mirabeau in April 1791 was a severe blow to Montmorin, the difficulty of whose position was enormously increased after the flight of the royal family to Varennes, to which he was not privy. He was forced to resign office, but still continued to advise Louis, and was one of the inner circle of the king&#x27;s friends, called by the revolutionists &quot;the Austrian Committee.&quot; In June 1792 his papers were seized at the foreign office, without anything incriminating being discovered; in July he was denounced, and after 10 August was proscribed. He took refuge in the house of a washerwoman, but was discovered, taken before the Legislative Assembly, and imprisoned in the Prison de l&#x27;Abbaye, where he perished in the September massacres. His relative, Louis Victor Henri, marquis de Montmorin de Saint Herem, head of the senior branch of the family, also perished in the massacre.

<text>A language code is a code that assigns letters or numbers as identifiers or classifiers for languages. These codes may be used to organize library collections or presentations of data, to choose the correct localizations and translations in computing, and as a shorthand designation for longer forms of language names.

== Difficulties of classification ==
Language code schemes attempt to classify the complex world of human languages, dialects, and variants. Most schemes make some compromises between being general and being complete enough to support specific dialects.

For example, Spanish is spoken in over 20 countries in North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and Europe. Spanish spoken in Mexico will be slightly different from Spanish spoken in Peru. Different regions of Mexico will have slightly different dialects and accents of Spanish. A language code scheme might group these all as &quot;Spanish&quot; for choosing a keyboard layout, most as &quot;Spanish&quot; for general usage, or separate each dialect to allow region-specific variation.

<doc id="221919" wikidata="Q133924" url="?curid=221919" title="Ōita Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located on the island of Kyūshū. Ōita Prefecture has a population of 1,136,245 (1 June 2019) and has a geographic area of 6,340 km2 (2,448 sq mi). Ōita Prefecture borders Fukuoka Prefecture to the northwest, Kumamoto Prefecture to the southwest, and Miyazaki Prefecture to the south.

Ōita is the capital and largest city of Ōita Prefecture, with other major cities including Beppu, Nakatsu, and Saiki. Ōita Prefecture is located in the northeast of Kyūshū on the Bungo Channel, connecting the Pacific Ocean and Seto Inland Sea, across from Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. Ōita Prefecture is famous for its hot springs and is a popular tourist destination in Japan for its &quot;onsen&quot; and &quot;ryokan&quot;, particularly in and around the city of Beppu. It has more &quot;onsen&quot; than any other Japanese prefecture.

== History ==

Around the 6th century, Kyushu consisted of four regions: Tsukushi Province, Hi Province, Kumaso Province and Toyo Province.

Toyo Province was later divided into two regions, upper and lower Toyo Province, called Bungo Province and Buzen Province.

After the Meiji Restoration, districts from Bungo and Buzen provinces were combined to form Ōita Prefecture. These provinces were divided among many local &quot;daimyōs&quot; and thus a large castle town never formed in Ōita. From this time that whole area became known as &quot;Toyo-no-Kuni&quot;, which means &quot;Land of Abundance&quot;.

The origins of the name Ōita are documented in a report from the early 8th century called the . According to the document, when Emperor Keikō visited the Kyushu region, stopping first in Toyo-no-Kuni, he exclaimed that &#x27;This is a vast land, indeed. It shall be known as Okita-Kuni!&#x27; Okita-Kuni, meaning &quot;Land of the Great Fields&quot;, later came to be written as &quot;Ōita&quot;. Present day interpretations based on Ōita&#x27;s topography state that Oita&#x27;s name comes from &quot;Okita&quot;, meaning &quot;many fields&quot;, rather than &quot;vast&quot; or &quot;great&quot; field, because of Ōita&#x27;s complex terrain.

In the Edo period (1603–1867) the town of Hita was the government seat for the entire domain of Kyushu, which was directly controlled by the national government or &quot;shōgun&quot; at that time. The region became well known for the money-lending industry based out of Hita. Merchants in Hita&#x27;s Mameda and Kuma districts worked with the national government to create this money-lending industry known as Hita-kin.

===Shrines and temples===
&quot;Sasamuta-jinja&quot; and &quot;Yusuhara Hachiman-gū&quot; are the chief Shinto shrines (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) in the prefecture.

Usa Jjingū, the head shrine of more than 40,000 Hachiman shrines, is located in Usa, Ōita.

== Geography ==
Ōita Prefecture is on the north-eastern section of the island of Kyūshū. It is from east to west, and from north to south, with a total area of 6,340.71 square kilometers.

Surrounded by the Suo Channel and Honshū Island to the north, the Iyo Channel and Shikoku Island to the east, it is bordered by Miyazaki Prefecture to the south, and Fukuoka Prefecture and Kumamoto Prefecture to the west. It is divided between north and south by a major tectonic line running from Usuki City in Ōita Prefecture to Yatsushiro City in Kumamoto Prefecture, which is to the west of Ōita. There are several other tectonic lines running from east to west through the prefecture. The northern part of the prefecture features granite and metamorphic rocks, while the southern area features limestone, which is the foundation for the Tsukumi cement industry, and several limestone caves. The Kirishima Range is a volcanic belt that runs vertically through the prefecture and contributes to the many hot spring sources that make the region a popular tourist attraction and makes Ōita the prefecture with the largest number of hot springs in the whole country.

The mountain ranges include the peaks of Mount Yufu, Mount Tsurumi, Mount Sobo, Mount Katamuki, and Mount Kujū (which is called the &quot;roof of Kyushu&quot;). These mountain ranges contribute to the fact that 70% of Oita is covered by forests, and the rivers and streams that flow from these ranges give the prefecture rich water sources. The prefecture&#x27;s major water sources are the Yamakuni River (with the Heisei Ozeki Dam and Yabakei Dam on it), Yakkan River, Ōita River, Ōno River (with Hakusui Dam on it), and Banjō River. The coastline features include Beppu Bay and the Bungo Channel. 

Mount Kujū, a volcano, is surrounded by highlands called the Kujū Highlands and the Handa Highlands. The main agriculture activity on the plateau grasslands north and south of Mt. Kujū is dairy farming. There are open plains throughout the prefecture with Nakatsu Plain in the north, Oita Plain in the center, and Saiki Plain in the south. The inland areas consist of basin valleys in Hita, Kusu, Yufuin and Taketa, which were formed by lava buildup in combination with river erosion. 

Ōita has a coastline that has shoals in the north, Beppu Bay in the center, and a jagged or sawtooth &quot;rias coastline&quot; in the south. Sea cliffs, caves, and sedimentary rock formations that can be found in Saiki City&#x27;s Yakata Island are considered very rare outside of coral reef areas. Ōita&#x27;s coastal waters contribute to a prosperous fishing industry.

As of April 1, 2014, 28% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Aso Kujū and Setonaikai National Parks; the Nippō Kaigan, Sobo-Katamuki, and Yaba-Hita-Hikosan Quasi-National Parks; and the Bungo Suidō, Jinkakuji Serikawa, Kunisaki Hantō, Sobo Katamuki, and Tsue Sankei Prefectural Natural Parks.

===Current municipalities===



Currently, the prefecture has 14 cities, 3 districts, 3 towns, and one village. From 2005 to 2006, all municipalities but Beppu, Tsukumi, Himeshima, Hiji, and all towns in Kusu District, were merged, and the total municipalities went down from 58 on December 31, 2004, to 18 after the creation of the city of Kunisaki by merging with 4 towns from Higashikunisaki District on March 31, 2006. As a result, the prefecture became the one with the fewest municipalities within Kyūshū, and the fourth fewest in Japan. However, Ōita Prefecture now has the fewest towns (3) and fewest towns and villages combined (4) in all of Japan.

== Economy ==

Ōita Prefecture&#x27;s industrial activity is centered on agricultural products. Fishery products and manufactured goods rank second and third respectively in terms of Ōita&#x27;s industrial activity.

Ōita is Japan&#x27;s number one producer of the following products:

Kabosu limes: Ōita Prefecture is Japan&#x27;s number one producer of kabosu, a citrus fruit that is similar to a lime. Kabosu are available year-round but peak season for taste and quality is from August to October. Kabosu are rich in vitamin C and contain beneficial acids, such as citric acid. Kabosu have been produced in the Taketa and Usuki areas for many years.

Dried shiitake mushrooms: Ōita is the largest producer of dried shiitake mushrooms in Japan, and the cultivation of shiitake mushrooms is said to have originated in Ōita. Ōita&#x27;s dried shiitake rank number one in Japan in production quantity and quality. Shiitake are said to be beneficial in the prevention of high blood pressure and arterial sclerosis.

Saffron: Saffron has been cultivated in Ōita since the late 19th century, and Ōita&#x27;s Taketa area produces 80% of Japan&#x27;s total amount of saffron, making Ōita the top producer of saffron. The quality of Ōita saffron has gained international acclaim as active component levels are several times higher than foreign saffron. Saffron is said to have many benefits including circulation enhancement and is used as a food coloring and natural medicine.

Galingale: Ōita is Japan&#x27;s top producer of , a kind of rush plant, a grass with a distinctive triangular profile, belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is grown in Kunisaki Peninsula of Ōita Prefecture and is used in the production of Ryukyu-style tatami mats, as it is dust and moisture absorbent and has a pleasant scent.

Madake bamboo: The madake variety of bamboo makes up 60% of Japan&#x27;s cultivated bamboo, and Ōita is Japan&#x27;s top producer. It is the most popular variety of bamboo used in handiwork and traditional crafts since it is very flexible and pressure resistant.

Ōita ranks number one in Japan (and second in the world next to America&#x27;s Yellowstone National Park) for the amount of hot-spring output and geothermal power. Ōita also ranks number one in Japan for the amount of limestone production.

===Other industries===

Seki-aji and seki-saba are mackerels that are well-known seafood products of Ōita. Ōita has gained nationwide recognition for their promotion of &quot;The Oita Brand&quot;, labeling local products with the prefectural name.

Key Ōita Brand products are as follows:

Agricultural products: tomatoes, leeks, strawberries, scallions, kabosu limes, greenhouse tangerines, , roses, chrysanthemums, pears (Hita City, Shonai Town in Yufu City and Kokonoe town in Kusu are all production regions for Japanese pears. Oita pears are shipped nationwide, with large distribution quantities throughout Kyushu), and Bungo beef (the Kujū highlands are a perfect feeding ground for cattle and cattle farmers in Oita are involved in breeding and shipping cattle. Bungo beef is a well known local product.).

Forest products: Dried shiitake mushrooms and Oita-style seasoned timber (Oita is one of the leading production centers for Japanese cedar, ranking second in Japan for amount of lumber reserves and number of cedars produced. Oita cedar producers use a special method for drying the wood which combines benefits of natural and artificial drying to produce cedar that has cracks and retains its natural scent and color.)

Marine products: cultured flatfish, cultured yellow jack, cultured yellowtail, cultured loach, pearl, cultured kuruma prawn, natural kuruma prawn (kuruma ebi), cuttlefish, hairtail, butterfish, blue crab, conger eel, clam, and Japanese mitten crab.

Economic development of Ōita was greatly aided by the One Village One Product movement of long-time governor Morihiko Hiramatsu. This movement has gained international attention and increased international exchange activities between Oita and overseas cities and countries.

The following companies operate factories in Oita: Toshiba Corporation, Nippon Steel Corporation, Canon Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., Sony, Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd., Showa Denko K.K., Kawasumi Laboratories Inc. (川澄化学工業株式会社), CKK, Asahi Kasei Medical Co. Ltd. (旭メディカル), NEC Corporation, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd, Mitsui E&amp;S Corporation.

== Demographics ==

As of October 1, 2008, Ōita&#x27;s total population was 1,201,715. Broken down into age groups, it was determined that 13.3% of the population was between the age of newborn and 14 years old, while 60.6% of the population was between the ages of 15 years and 64 years old, and 25.8% of the population was 65 years old or older.

In 2008, there were 11,034 non-Japanese residents registered in Ōita, that was up 1,684 people from the previous year.

As of December 2009, Ōita was ranked as having the highest number of foreign students relative to population in Japan. Oita has 339.8 foreign students per 100,000 people in the prefecture, where Tokyo, now ranking second has 329.4 foreign students per 100,000 people in the city. This is contributed to the fact that Ritsumeikan Asia-Pacific University (APU) in Beppu accepts many foreign students. As of November 1, 2009, there were 4,160 foreign students in Ōita total, from 101 different countries and territories, with the majority being from Asia (e.g. China and South Korea).

== Culture ==
Oita is in the northeast corner of the island of Kyushu. Its coastal areas, farmland, highland, and mountains lend to a mix of different farming and fishing culture. There are many festivals throughout the year to pray for healthy harvests and abundant crops.

As of May 2006, 146 cultural assets in Ōita were designated by the national government (Agency for Cultural Affairs), four of which are designated as National Treasures. Additionally, the prefecture itself has designated almost 700 traditions, properties, landmarks etc. as cultural assets.

===National treasures===
# Fuki-ji Temple: The only wooden structure in Kyushu to remain intact since the Heian period (794–1192). Fukiji Temple is in Bungotakada.
# The Main Building of Usa Shrine: A building which is said to be a prototype for &quot;hachiman&quot; style architecture located in Usa City.
# Peacock Buddhist Altar Fitting: This is a Buddhist altar fitting called &quot;Kujaku Monkei&quot; with engraved peacocks and an inscription dated 1209. The information on it tells of the relationship between Usa Shrine and the former Mirokuji, a Buddhist temple once connected to the shrine as a jingū-ji.
# Usuki Stone Buddhas: Approximately 60 cliff carvings of Buddha that were crafted between the Heian period (794–1192) and the Kamakura period (1185–1333) are the only rock carvings of their kind to have received a &quot;National Treasure&quot; designation. They are in Usuki City. 

Below are some of Oita&#x27;s cultural traditions that are designated by the Agency for Cultural Affairs as Important Intangible Cultural Properties:

# Shujo Onie Fire Festival: An event held to pray for national security, health, and longevity on the first day of the Chinese New Year at temples of Tendai Buddhist denomination in the Kunisaki Peninsula area. The three temples that continue to hold this event are the Tennenji-temple (Bungotakata City), Iwatoji-temple (Kunisaki Town) and Jobutsuji-temple (Kunisaki Town).
# Koyo Shrine Puppet Show: This is a puppet show also known as &quot;Kitabaru Puppet Show&quot; which uses &quot;kugutsu&quot; puppets that perform dance and sumo wrestling matches. Oita&#x27;s Hachiman Kohyo Shrine is in Nakatsu City.
# Hita&#x27;s Gion Festival: A festival held in Hita City in July with parade floats that are up to 12 meters high. Although the festival only takes place once a year, the magnificent floats are on display year-round at the Gion Festival Float Museum in Kuma Town, Hita City.
# Yoshihiro Gaku Traditional Performing Art: Dance performed along with traditional song and music in Musashi Town in Kunisaki Peninsula
# Manufacturing Process of Sulfur &quot;Flowers&quot; at Myoban Hot Spring: Thatched huts at Myoban Hot Spring are used to produce &quot;yu-no-hana&quot; or sulfur “flowers” which are crystals that develop naturally on the ground around the springs. The manufacturing and collection process of the sulfur flowers has remained largely unchanged since the Edo period and thus the manufacturing process itself is designated as an ethno-cultural asset. The crystals are used as the main component of bath salts sold in Myoban, which are a popular souvenir that is used to help heal skin conditions.

===Dance===
Kagura is a sacred dance performed at festivals and celebrations throughout the prefecture.

Shonai kagura is a festive dance that has been practiced for over 200 years and is representative of Oita Prefecture. Another kagura, the Ondake-style Kagura, was nationally designated as an &quot;Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property&quot; in 2007. There is also traditional song and music known as &quot;gaku&quot; that is performed in the Kunisaki Peninsula Area and is accompanied by characteristic dances such as the &quot;Yoshihirogaku&quot; in Musashi Town. Dancers wear grass skirts and dance with a drum tied to their front and a flag tied to their backs to pray to the Buddhist God Amida Buddha. In the Ono district there are 80 groups of &quot;Shishimai&quot; or dancers who perform a lion dance with roots based on the Ondake-style dance.

===Crafts===
Onta Pottery is the name of a type of stoneware pottery made for everyday usage – typically called &#x27;mingei&#x27; (folk art or craft) in Japanese. The community is situated in the Hiko mountain range, about 17 kilometres from the centre of Hita City, and is said to have been established in 1705 to make large wares – lidded jars for pickled vegetables and fruit, water crocks, ash burners, and pouring vessels with small spouts – for local farmhouses. At the time potters were themselves farmers, who produced pots during the &#x27;off season&#x27; in agriculture. These they fired in a cooperative kiln (kyōdō noborigama). 

Onta pottery is now produced full-time by ten families in Sarayama, five of whom continue to share and fire an eight chambered climbing kiln. The other five households fire independent climbing kilns of four or five chambers, which they fire approximately six times a year. The potters use clays that they dig locally and obtain natural materials (notably, wood ash, rice straw ash, feldspar, iron oxide and, occasionally, copper) with which to mix their glazes. Sarayama is famous for the &#x27;karausu&#x27; clay pounders lining its two streams and powered by the water therein. The fact that the clay pounders prepare only enough clay for two people to work with full-time at the wheel has determined both household structure and the number of houses able to take up pottery in Sarayama.

For anything other than small pots, potters use a kick wheel on which to throw their wares, which they decorate typically with hakeme and tobiganna slipware decoration techniques. In April 1995, the Agency for Cultural Affairs announced the designation of Onta Pottery as an &quot;Important Intangible Cultural Property&quot; in 1995. This designation is for the actual techniques used in making the pottery and not the actual pots themselves. Precisely because the designation is for the process rather than the product, it is regarded as an &quot;intangible&quot; property and is the only stoneware pottery-making process so designated in Japan.

Bamboo Crafts were started in the late 14th century to create baskets for travelling goods salesmen. During the Edo period (1600–1868) Beppu thrived as a tourist town and bamboo baskets and goods were used in the daily lives of the local people for everything from cooking to washing in order to meet the demands of the thriving tourist population. The bamboo items soon became a souvenir that tourists purchased to take home and this solidified making Beppu a center for Bamboo crafts production. In 1903 a training center for bamboo workers was established and present-day visitors to Beppu can enjoy learning about the history of bamboo, and hands-on classes at the Beppu City Traditional Bamboo Crafts Center. Festivals using bamboo shoots as candle holders are carried out yearly in the autumn in Usuki, Taketa, and Hita Cities.

The Kunisaki Peninsula has been called &quot;Buddha&#x27;s Village&quot; and many Buddhist statues and temples fill the areas surrounding Bungotakada and Kunisaki. The most notable of these are the &quot;Rokugō Manzan&quot; (六郷満山) temples. &quot;Shinbutsu-shūgō&quot; (神仏習合), or the syncretism of Buddhism and Shinto, is said to have begun in this region out of the unique &quot;Rokugō Manzan&quot; culture.

Usa Jingū in Usa is the head shrine of Hachiman Shrines in Japan. It is said to be the birthplace of mikoshi.

Mankoji Temple which was founded in 1352 is a place for practicing zen meditation.

===Architecture===
The Agency for Cultural Affairs also designates certain areas for preservation as Groups of Traditional Buildings. The merchant quarter of Hita, Mameda Town, is one of 83 districts (as of April 1, 2009) throughout the country designated as &quot;Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings&quot;. Old samurai residences throughout the prefecture are points of architectural interest. Nioza Historical Road in Usuki is also lined with buildings dating back to the 16th century and also in Usuki the Inaba-Family Villa is a former samurai residence open to the public.

Arata Isozaki is a world-renowned architect who is from Oita. The former Oita Prefectural Library (now Oita Art Plaza) won an award for architectural design in 1967. Other works of his can be found throughout the prefecture including B-con Plaza in Beppu, Bungo-No-Kuni Information Library, the Audio-Visual Center in Oita City, and Yufu Train Station.

== Tourism ==

Ōita Prefecture is famous for its hot springs, particularly those in and around the city of Beppu. The most well-known of Beppu&#x27;s hot springs are known as the Hells of Beppu. These &quot;hells&quot; are for viewing only and cannot be used for bathing. Beppu also has eight major geothermal hotspots known as &quot;Beppu Hattō&quot; (別府八湯). Within the city of Beppu, there are more than 150 individual &quot;onsen&quot; bathing facilities. 

The city&#x27;s ryokans and public onsen are amply supplied by the same volcanic source. When Chiba University and Tokyo&#x27;s Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies compiled a list of prefectures meeting demands for reusable energy, Oita ranked number one with a 25.2% rate of self-sufficiency through the use of geothermal energy and hot spring heat.

The city of Beppu is a busy passenger port with regular ferry links through the inland sea to Osaka and several other destinations, and offers a variety of cultural experiences. For instance, the public aquarium &quot;Umi-tamago&quot; on the shoreline outside Beppu features basketballing sea otters, performing archer fish, and puzzle-solving octopuses, along with more naturalistic displays of freshwater and marine fish from around the world.

Also in Beppu, there is the Kijima Kogen Amusement Park (城島高原パーク). In Hiji, there is a Sanrio theme park called Harmonyland (ハーモニーランド). 

Yufuin is another popular destination for tourists. It is known for its &quot;onsen&quot;, shopping streets, &quot;ryokan&quot;, Mount Yufu (由布岳, &quot;Yufudake&quot;), and Lake Kinrin (金鱗湖, &quot;Kinrin-ko&quot;).

The Kunisaki Peninsula is well-known for its hiking trails, many mountain valleys, and the temples and Buddhist statues located throughout the area.

Another attraction is Mount Takasaki Monkey Park, a park featuring two distinct troupes of wild Japanese macaque monkeys that make regular visits to the feeding grounds. The reserve was initially established to prevent the monkeys from raiding the region&#x27;s fruit crops, a behavior that brought them into conflict with local farmers. The wild macaques can be observed up close in the park during the feeding sessions. 

Previously, Mt. Hachimen in Nakatsu was home to Concert on the Rock, a music festival held as an annual charity event which saw over 30 international acts performing over a weekend in June 2004. The event was held again in 2005 but has since been discontinued.

In 2017, the creators of Pokémon Go held an event from March 4 to 13 featuring newly spawned Pokémon Snorlax for players to check areas hit by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes and help support the local economy. A spokeswoman for the company said that the game event would provide many opportunities for players to come and see the sights. The event followed a similar event that spawned the Pokémon Lapras in the Miyagi Prefecture in November 2016 in areas that were severely damaged by the 2011 earthquake.

==Notable people==
* Ōtomo Sōrin (1530–1587): The Otomo family ruled over the Funai Domain, which is present day Ōita City, in the 16th century. Funai was a very internationalized city which engaged in trade and exchange with other nations. Sōrin, the 21st leader of the Ōtomo clan, embraced Western culture enthusiastically and invited the missionary Francis Xavier to the city to promote Christianity. Sōrin dreamed of creating a Christian nation; he was baptized and given the name &quot;Don Francisco&quot;. Sōrin died in Tsukumi.
* Miura Baien (September 1, 1723 – April 9, 1789): A scholar originally known as Susumu but called Baien after the name of his private school where he educated many scholars. Miura developed his own system of logic and wrote many works including his three famous words, , , and . He also worked in a hospital and had a good knowledge of astronomy. He hand made an astronomical globe that was passed down through many generations. He spent his entire life in Tominaga Village which is the present day area of Aki Town in Kunisaki City. Miura Baien is considered one of Ōita&#x27;s three sages along with Hoashi Banri and Hirose Tansō.
* : Miura Baien&#x27;s pupil who expanded his academic ability into many fields including Confucianism, natural sciences, medicine and language. He taught himself Dutch to reference scientific publications for his eight-volume work &quot;Kyuritsu&quot;, which was considered the top work of Western natural science in Japan at that time. In 1832 he was made Minister for the Feudal Lord to fix the financial problems of the Hiji clan. Banri Hoashi is considered one of Ōita&#x27;s three sages along with Miura Baien and Hirose Tansō.
* : A Confucian scholar, poet and educator from a money-lending family in Hita. Ōita&#x27;s current governor Katsusada Hirose is a descendant of Tansō Hirose. In Edo period Japan, education was limited to samurai families and the rich. However, Hirose Tansō opened a school called meaning &quot;all are welcome&quot; and admitted students regardless of social status, age, or education level. The school&#x27;s methodology of a &quot;self-administered work-study policy&quot; is said to have had great influence on the modern day education system in Japan. Former Prime Minister Kiyoura Keigo was educated here, with other students who went on to become influential scholars, artists and politicians. The school remains were designated a historical site in 1932 and are a couple blocks from the original Hirose family house, now the Hirose Museum. There, Tansō Hirose and other family members’ works are on display, with other original Hirose artifacts, China dolls, tea ceremony utensils and more. Both are in Mameda Town, about a 10-minute walk from Hita Station. Tansō Hirose is considered one of the Oita&#x27;s three sages along with Miura Baien and Hoashi Banri. An asteroid called 10009 Hirosetanso discovered by the University of Tokyo in 1977 was named after Tansō Hirose.
* Fukuzawa Yukichi (1834–1901): Founded Japan&#x27;s oldest institute of higher education, Keio University in Tokyo. Fukuzawa Yukichi grew up in the Nakatsu domain and is pictured on the 10,000 yen bill. He was influential in Japan&#x27;s education system by promoting independence and self-reliance of the Japanese people at his classes as Keio-Gijuku University, known as present day Keio University, originally a school for Western studies. The university now educates in a range of fields and produces influential and prominent alumni.
* Hiroshi Nagahama (born 1970): Veteran anime industry luminary who began his career in 1990 with Madhouse Studio as an animator and went on to direct &quot;Mushishi&quot;, &quot;Detroit Metal City&quot;, &quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot; and &quot;The Reflection&quot;, as well as serving as art director of &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;.
* Yamamoto Tatsuo, once governor of the Bank of Japan from 1898 to 1903, was from here.

<text>Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine (perching) birds known for the often dark, glossy iridescent sheen of their plummage; their complex vocalizations including mimicing; and their distinctive, often elaborate swarming behavior, known as [[Starlings#Murmuration|murmuration]]. 

Starlings belong to the family Sturnidae, common name of Sturnid,The Sturnidae are named for the genus &quot;Sturnus&quot;, which in turn comes from the Latin word for starling, &quot;sturnus&quot;. The family contains 128 species which are divided into 36 genera. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas, as well as North America, Hawaii, and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be invasive species. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific.

Having strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, they eat insects and fruit, and most species nest in holes and lay blue or white eggs. Several species live around human habitation and are effectively omnivores. Many species search for prey such as grubs by &quot;open-bill probing&quot;, that is, forcefully opening the bill after inserting it into a crevice, thus expanding the hole and exposing the prey; this behaviour is referred to by the German verb &quot;zirkeln&quot; (pronounced ).
Starlings have diverse and complex vocalizations and have been known to embed sounds from their surroundings into their own calls, including car alarms and human speech patterns. The birds can recognize particular individuals by their calls and are the subject of research into the evolution of human language.

==Description==

Starlings are medium-sized passerines. The shortest-bodied species is Kenrick&#x27;s starling (&quot;Poeoptera kenricki&quot;), at , but the lightest-weight species is Abbott&#x27;s starling (&quot;Poeoptera femoralis&quot;), which is . The largest starling, going on standard measurements and perhaps weight, is the Nias hill myna (&quot;Gracula robusta&quot;). This species can measure up to , and in domestication they can weigh up to . Rivaling the prior species in bulk if not dimensions, the mynas of the genus &quot;Mino&quot; are also large, especially the yellow-faced (&quot;M. dumontii&quot;) and long-tailed mynas (&quot;M. kreffti&quot;). The longest species in the family is the white-necked myna (&quot;Streptocitta albicollis&quot;), which can measure up to , although around 60% in this magpie-like species is comprised by its very long tail.

Less sexual dimorphism is seen in plumage, but with only 25 species showing such differences between the two sexes. The plumage of the starling is often brightly coloured due to iridescence; this colour is derived from the structure of the feathers, not from any pigment. Some species of Asian starling have crests or erectile feathers on the crest. Other ornamentation includes elongated tail feathers and brightly coloured bare areas on the face. These colours can be derived from pigments, or as in the Bali myna, structural colour, caused by light scattering off parallel collagen fibers. The irises of many species are red and yellow, although those of younger birds are much darker.

==Distribution, habitat and movements==

Starlings inhabit a wide range of habitats from the Arctic Circle to the Equator. The only habitats they do not typically occupy are very dry sandy deserts. The family is naturally absent from the Americas and from large parts of Australia, but it is present over the majority of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The genus &quot;Aplonis&quot; has also spread widely across the islands of the Pacific, reaching Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia (in addition one species in the genus &quot;Mino&quot; has reached the Solomon Islands). Also, a species of this genus is the only starling found in northern Australia.

Asian species are most common in evergreen forests; 39 species found in Asia are predominantly forest birds as opposed to 24 found in more open or human modified environments. In contrast to this, African species are more likely to be found in open woodlands and savannah; 33 species are open-area specialists compared to 13 true forest species. The high diversity of species found in Asia and Africa is not matched by Europe, which has one widespread (and very common) species and two more restricted species. The European starling is both highly widespread and extremely eclectic in its habitat, occupying most types of open habitat. Like many other starling species, it has also adapted readily to human-modified habitat, including farmland, orchards, plantations, and urban areas.

Some species of starlings are migratory, either entirely, like Shelley&#x27;s starling, which breeds in Ethiopia and Somaliland and migrates to Kenya, Tanzania, and Somalia, or like the white-shouldered starling, which is migratory in part of its range, but is resident in others.

The European starling was purposely introduced to North America in the 1870s through the 1890s by multiple acclimatisation societies, organizations dedicated to introducing European flora and fauna into North America for cultural and economic reasons. A persistent story alleges that Eugene Schieffelin, chairman of the American Acclimatization Society, decided all birds mentioned by William Shakespeare should be in North America, leading to the introduction of the starling to the U.S.; however, this claim is more fiction than fact. While Schieffelin and other members of the society did release starlings in Central Park in 1890, the birds had already been in the U.S. since at least the mid-1870s, and Schieffelin was not inspired to do so by Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

==Murmuration==

A highly social bird, most starlings associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year and are widely known for a distinctive, often dramatic swarming behavior known as murmuration — a simultaneously synchronized and seemingly random flock movement characterized by sudden, erratic direction changes without an observable leader.

The sharp pushing, pulling, diving, pulsating and swooping of the flock in response to the individual movements may confuse and discourage predators such as falcons, providing a collective protection. The term &quot;murmuration&quot; derives from the low, indistinct sounds of a dense flock&#x27;s wings — i.e., the &quot;murmor&quot;. 

Initial study by ornithologist Edmund Selous (1887-1934) sought to explain the murmation of starlings through the idea of thought-transference. By 2013, physicists in Italy along with mechanical and aerospace engineers working with Princeton University, determined that no single bird could control a flock, and certainly not the movements of more than a thousand birds. Researchers used a computer simulation to determine that each bird synchronized with its seven closest neighbors, creating overlapping groups that communicated their movements — focusing on three simple parameters: attraction, repulsion and angular alignment. Thus the flock moves as each individual bird synchronizes with its nearest group. Researchers also confirmed that a particular shape to the flock formation worked most efficiently for data accuracy — and specifically in starlings, a pancake shape. Thinner, thicker or spherical shapes did not improve performance, rather optimal performance was related to a pancake flock shape.

They noted that &quot;information moves across the flock very quickly and with nearly no degradation,&quot; describing it as &quot;a high signal-to-noise ratio&quot; enabled by a bird&#x27;s very high temporal resolution: they can receive and process certain information more quickly than humans and can &quot;see faster&quot; than humans.&quot; Unlike the children&#x27;s game of telephone where a message is sequentially passed from person to person and very quickly loses information, researchers determined that almost no information is lost across a starling flock.

Starling murmurations can last from a few seconds up to 45 minutes; can involve few birds or up to tens of thousands; may include other species of starlings or species from other families; and sometimes form abstract dramatic shapes, patterns or subtle gradations. In Denmark, where murmurations have been estimated to involve a million starlings, the phenomenon is called the Black Sun, or &quot;Sort sol&quot; in Danish. In Ireland, starlings’ numbers are boosted during winter, as migrating flocks arrive from breeding grounds around Western Europe and Scandinavia. 

===Behavior===
Starlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15–20 distinct imitations. They also imitate a few sounds other than those of wild birds. The calls of abundant species or calls that are simple in frequency structure and show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated. Dialects of mimicked sounds can be local.

The Starling&#x27;s sociality is particularly evident in their roosting behavior; in the nonbreeding season, some roosts can number in the thousands.

===Diet and feeding===
The diets of the starlings are usually dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds, in Asia and Africa, for example, white sandalwood and Indian banyan. In addition to trees, they are also important dispersers of parasitic mistletoes. In South Africa, the red-winged starling is an important disperser of the introduced &quot;Acacia cyclops&quot;. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, which led to the speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol.

Laboratory experiments on European starlings have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly. In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings also consume nectar. The extent to which starlings are important pollinators is unknown, but at least some are, such as the slender-billed starling of alpine East Africa, which pollinates giant lobelias.

==Systematics==

The starling family Sturnidae was introduced (as Sturnidia) by French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815.
The starlings belong to the superfamily Muscicapoidea, together with thrushes, flycatchers and chats, as well as dippers, which are quite distant relatives, and Mimidae (thrashers and mockingbirds). The latter are apparently the Sturnidae&#x27;s closest living relatives, replace them in the Americas, and have a rather similar but more solitary lifestyle. They are morphologically quite similar too—a partly albinistic specimen of a mimid, mislabelled as to suggest an Old World origin, was for many decades believed to represent an extinct starling (see Rodrigues starling for details).


The oxpeckers are sometimes placed here as a subfamily, but the weight of evidence has shifted towards granting them full family status as a more basal member of the Sturnidae-Mimidae group, derived from an early expansion into Africa.

Usually, the starlings are considered a family, as is done here. Sibley &amp; Monroe included the mimids in the family and demoted the starlings to tribe rank, as Sturnini. This treatment was used by Zuccon et al. However, the grouping of Sibley &amp; Monroe is overly coarse due to methodological drawbacks of their DNA-DNA hybridization technique and most of their proposed revisions of taxonomic rank have not been accepted (see for example Ciconiiformes). The all-inclusive Sturnidae grouping conveys little information about biogeography, and obscures the evolutionary distinctness of the three lineages. Establishing a valid name for the clade consisting of Sibley/Monroe&#x27;s &quot;pan-Sturnidae&quot; would nonetheless be desirable to contrast them with the other major lineages of Muscicapoidea.

Starlings probably originated in the general area of East Asia, perhaps towards the southwestern Pacific, as inferred by the number of plesiomorphic lineages to occur there. Expansion into Africa appears to have occurred later, as most derived forms are found there. An alternative scenario would be African origin for the entire &quot;sturnoid&quot; group, with the oxpeckers representing an ancient relict and the mimids arriving in South America. This is contradicted by the North American distribution of the most basal Mimidae.

As the fossil record is limited to quite Recent forms, the proposed Early Miocene (about 25–20 Mya) divergence dates for the &quot;sturnoids&quot; lineages must be considered extremely tentative. Given the overall evidence for the origin of most Passeri families in the first half of the Miocene, it appears to be not too far off the mark, however.

 recent studies identified two major clades of this family, corresponding to the generally drab, often striped, largish &quot;atypical mynas&quot; and other mainly Asian-Pacific lineages, and the often smaller, sometimes highly apomorphic taxa which are most common in Africa and the Palearctic, usually have metallic coloration, and in a number of species also bright carotinoid plumage colors on the underside. Inside this latter group, there is a clade consisting of species which, again, are usually not too brightly colored, and which consists of the &quot;typical&quot; myna-&quot;Sturnus&quot; assemblage.

The Philippine creepers, a single genus of three species of treecreeper-like birds, appear to be highly apomorphic members of the more initial radiation of the Sturnidae. While this may seem odd at first glance, their placement has always been contentious. In addition, biogeography virtually rules out a close relationship of Philippine creepers and treecreepers, as neither the latter nor their close relatives seem to have ever reached Wallacea, let alone the Philippines. Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Sturnidae is not entirely final and eventually, they may remain a separate family.

Genus sequence follows traditional treatments. This is apparently not entirely correct, with &quot;Scissirostrum&quot; closer to &quot;Aplonis&quot; than to &quot;Gracula&quot;, for example, and &quot;Acridotheres&quot; among the most advanced genera. Too few taxa have yet been studied as regards their relationships, however, thus a change in the sequence has to wait for further studies.

As of 2023, the review by Lovette &amp; Rubenstein (2008) is the most recent work on the phylogeny of the group. This taxonomy is also based on the order of the IOC.


The extinct Mascarene starlings were formerly of uncertain relationships, but are now thought to belong to the Oriental-Australasian clade, being allied with the Bali myna. However, while the two more recent species (&quot;Fregipilus&quot; and &quot;Necropsar&quot;) have been classified, the prehistoric &quot;Cryptopsar&quot; has not.

<text>The mynas (; mynah) are a group of birds in the starling family (Sturnidae). This is a group of passerine birds which are native to Iran and Southern Asia, especially Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Several species have been introduced to areas like North America, Australia, South Africa, Fiji and New Zealand, especially the common myna, which is often regarded as an invasive species. It is often known as &quot;Selarang&quot; and &quot;Teck Meng&quot; in Malay and Chinese respectively in Singapore, due to their high population there.

Mynas are not a natural group; instead, the term &quot;myna&quot; is used for any starling in the Indian subcontinent, regardless of their relationships. This range was colonized twice during the evolution of starlings, first by rather ancestral starlings related to the coleto and &quot;Aplonis&quot; lineages, and millions of years later by birds related to the common starling and wattled starling&#x27;s ancestors. These two groups of mynas can be distinguished in the more terrestrial adaptions of the latter, which usually also have less glossy plumage, except on the heads, and longer tails. The Bali myna, which is critically endangered and nearly extinct in the wild, is highly distinctive.

Some mynas are considered talking birds, for their ability to reproduce sounds, including human speech, when in captivity.

&quot;Myna&quot; is derived from the Hindi/Urdu (मैना / ) &quot;mainā&quot; which itself is derived from Sanskrit &quot;madanā&quot;.

==Characteristics==

Mynas are medium-sized passerines with strong feet. Their flight is strong and direct, and they are gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit.

Plumage is typically dark, often brown, although some species have yellow head ornaments. Most species nest in holes.

Some species have become well known for their imitative skills; the common hill myna is one of these.

==Species==

The following are species of mynas. The coleto and the two &quot;Saroglossa&quot; starlings are included because of their position in the taxonomic list.

<text>Ian Penman (born 1959) is a British writer, music journalist and critic. He began his career as a writer for the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; in 1977, later contributing to various publications including &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, &quot;The Wire&quot;, &quot;The Face&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He is the author of &quot;Vital Signs: Music, Movies, and Other Manias&quot; (1998, Serpent&#x27;s Tail).

==Biography==
Penman was born in Wiltshire, UK, in 1959. He spent much of his childhood abroad in the Middle East and Africa, returning to Norfolk in 1970. Skipping higher education, Penman began writing for prominent British music magazine the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;) in the autumn of 1977. Much of Penman&#x27;s writing reflected his involvement in the nascent post-punk scene developing in London in the late 1970s.

Along with fellow &quot;NME&quot; writers such as Paul Morley and Barney Hoskyns, Penman developed a style of music criticism influenced by critical theory, philosophy and other art mediums that was often experimental in its prose. With their increasingly esoteric writing standing in contrast to the magazine&#x27;s more accessible competitors, such as &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the &quot;NME&quot; began to alienate its readership; it is estimated that within several years, the magazine suffered the loss of half its circulation, in large part due to the new direction of Penman and his colleagues.

Penman continued writing intermittently for the &quot;NME&quot; until 1985, when the magazine began moving in an increasingly commercial direction. He began freelance work for various outlets, including &quot;The Face&quot;, &quot;Arena&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. In the 1990s, he contributed to &quot;The Wire&quot;. In 1998, Penman published a compilation of his work entitled &quot;Vital Signs: Music, Movies, and Other Mania&quot; on Serpent&#x27;s Tail to positive reviews. Julia Kenna reviewed the book for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, commenting, 
Full of contradictions and witty one-liners, Penman uses language as an art form, playing with puns, synonyms, repetition, and punctuation for added effect... Two decades of politics, music and pop culture with a whip-smart wit and wisdom that draws you in and doesn’t let go.

Penman contributed the text to the catalogue of photographer Robert Frank&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Storylines&quot; (Tate Modern. 2004). In recent years, Penman has continued contributing to various publications, such as &quot;The Wire&quot;, &quot;City Journal&quot; and the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, and is working on a book about Britain in the 1970s.

He was joint winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Biography for &quot;Fassbinder Thousands of Mirrors&quot;.

==Influence==
Penman has been cited as an influence by range of writers and theorists, including Simon Reynolds, Kodwo Eshun, and Mark Fisher. In addition, artists such as Simon Raymonde of Cocteau Twins have cited Penman&#x27;s writing as an inspiration.

<text>The oxpeckers are two species of bird which make up the genus Buphagus, and family Buphagidae. The oxpeckers were formerly usually treated as a subfamily, Buphaginae, within the starling family, Sturnidae, but molecular phylogenetic studies have consistently shown that they form a separate lineage that is basal to the sister clades containing the Sturnidae and the Mimidae (mockingbirds, thrashers, and allies). Oxpeckers are endemic to the savanna of Sub-Saharan Africa. 

Both the English and scientific names arise from their habit of perching on large mammals (both wild and domesticated) such as cattle, zebras, impalas, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and giraffes, eating ticks, small insects, botfly larvae, and other parasites, as well as the animals&#x27; blood. The behaviour of oxpeckers towards large mammals was thought to be exclusively mutual, though recent research suggests the relationship can be parasitic in nature as well.

The Swahili name for the red-billed oxpecker is Askari wa kifaru (the rhino&#x27;s guard).

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Buphagus&quot; was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson with the yellow-billed oxpecker as the type species. The name combines the Ancient Greek words &quot;bous&quot; &quot;ox&quot; and &quot;-&quot; &quot;eating&quot;.

According to the more recent studies of Muscicapoidea phylogeny, the oxpeckers are an ancient line related to Mimidae (mockingbirds and thrashers) and starlings but not particularly close to either. Considering the known biogeography of these groups, the most plausible explanation seems that the oxpecker lineage originated in Eastern or Southeastern Asia like the other two. This would make the two species of &quot;Buphagus&quot; something like living fossils, and demonstrates that such remnants of past evolution can possess striking and unique autapomorphic adaptations.

The genus contains two species:



==Distribution and habitat==
The oxpeckers are endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, where they occur in most open habitats. They are absent from the driest deserts and the rainforests. Their distribution is restricted by the presence of their preferred prey, specific species of ticks, and the animal hosts of those ticks. The two species of oxpecker are sympatric over much of East Africa and may even occur on the same host animal. The nature of the interactions between the two species is unknown.

==Behaviour==

===Diet and feeding===
Oxpeckers graze exclusively on the bodies of large mammals. Certain species are seemingly preferred, whereas others, like the Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest or topi are generally avoided. Smaller antelope such as lechwe, duikers and reedbuck are also avoided; the smallest regularly used species is the impala, probably because of the heavy tick load and social nature of that species. In many parts of their range they now feed on cattle, but avoid camels. They feed on ectoparasites, particularly ticks, as well as insects infesting wounds and the flesh and blood of some wounds as well. They are sometimes classified as parasites, because they open wounds on the animals&#x27; backs.

Oxpecker/mammal interactions are the subject of some debate and ongoing research. They were originally thought to be an example of mutualism, but recent evidence suggests that oxpeckers may be parasites instead. Oxpeckers do eat ticks, but often the ticks have already fed on the ungulate host, and no statistically significant link has been shown between oxpecker presence and reduced ectoparasite load. Oxpeckers have been observed to open new wounds and enhance existing ones in order to drink the blood of their perches. Oxpeckers also feed on the earwax and dandruff of mammals; less is known about the possible benefits of this to the mammal, but it is suspected that this is also a parasitic behaviour. Some oxpeckers&#x27; hosts are intolerant of their presence. Elephants and some antelope will actively dislodge the oxpeckers when they land. However there have been noted instances of elephants allowing oxpeckers to eat parasites off of them. Other species tolerate oxpeckers while they search for ticks on their faces, which one author says &quot;appears ... to be an uncomfortable and invasive process.&quot;

===Breeding===

The breeding season of the oxpeckers, in at least one location, is linked to the rainy season, which affects the activity of their mammalian hosts and the tick loads of those hosts. Both courtship and copulation occur on their hosts as well. They nest in holes, usually in trees but sometimes in other types of cavity, including holes in walls. The nests are lined with grasses and often with hair plucked from their hosts and even livestock such as sheep which are not usually used. The typical clutch is between two and three eggs, but the red-billed oxpecker may lay up to five eggs.

== Roosting ==
Red-billed oxpeckers have been known to roost in reeds and trees. Studies of large savanna herbivores using cameras at night have shown that both species of oxpecker (but more often in yellow-billed oxpecker) may also roost on the bodies of herbivores, hanging under the insides of the thighs of giraffe and on top of impala and buffalo.

<text>Pasture (from the Latin &quot;pastus&quot;, past participle of &quot;pascere&quot;, &quot;to feed&quot;) is land used for grazing.

==Types of pasture==

Pasture lands in the narrow sense are enclosed tracts of farmland, grazed by domesticated livestock, such as horses, cattle, sheep, or swine. The vegetation of tended pasture, forage, consists mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants). Pasture is typically grazed throughout the summer, in contrast to meadow which is ungrazed or used for grazing only after being mown to make hay for animal fodder.

Pasture in a wider sense additionally includes rangelands, other unenclosed pastoral systems, and land types used by wild animals for grazing or browsing.
Pasture lands in the narrow sense are distinguished from rangelands by being managed through more intensive agricultural practices of seeding, irrigation, and the use of fertilizers, while rangelands grow primarily native vegetation, managed with extensive practices like controlled burning and regulated intensity of grazing.

Soil type, minimum annual temperature, and rainfall are important factors in pasture management.
Sheepwalk is an area of grassland where sheep can roam freely. The productivity of sheepwalk is measured by the number of sheep per area. This is dependent, among other things, on the underlying rock. Sheepwalk is also the name of townlands in County Roscommon, Ireland, and County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. Unlike factory farming, which entails in its most intensive form entirely trough-feeding, managed or unmanaged pasture is the main food source for ruminants. Pasture feeding dominates livestock farming where the land makes crop sowing or harvesting (or both) difficult, such as in arid or mountainous regions, where types of camel, goat, antelope, yak and other ruminants live which are well suited to the more hostile terrain and very rarely factory-farmed. In more humid regions, pasture grazing is managed across a large global area for free range and organic farming. Certain pasture types suit the diet, evolution, and metabolism of particular animals. Their fertilising and tending of the land may over generations result in the pasture combined with the ruminants in question being integral to a particular ecosystem.

==Examples of pasture habitats==
* Bocage
* Grassland
* Heathland
* Machair
* Maquis
* Moorland
* Pampas
* Potrero (landform)
* Prairie
* Rangeland
* Rough pasture
* Savanna
* Sown biodiverse pasture
* Steppe
* Wood pasture
* Veld

Vaughan was the fastest-growing municipality in Canada between 1996 and 2006 with its population increasing by 80.2% during this time period and having nearly doubled in population since 1991. It is the fifth-largest city in the Greater Toronto Area, and the 17th-largest city in Canada.

==Toponymy==
The township was named after Benjamin Vaughan, a British commissioner who signed a peace treaty with the United States in 1783.

==History==

In the late pre-contact period, the Huron-Wendat people populated what is today Vaughan. The Skandatut ancestral Wendat village overlooked the east branch of the Humber River (Pine Valley Drive) and was once home to approximately 2,000 Huron in the sixteenth century. The site is close to a Huron ossuary (mass grave) uncovered in Kleinburg in 1970, and one kilometre north of the Seed-Barker Huron site.

The first European to pass through Vaughan was the French explorer Étienne Brûlé, who traversed the Humber Trail in 1615. However, it was not until townships were created in 1792 that Vaughan began to see European settlements, as it was considered to be extremely remote and the lack of roads through the region made travel difficult.

Despite the hardships of pioneer life, settlers came to Vaughan in considerable numbers. The population grew from 19 men, 5 women, and 30 children in 1800 to 4,300 in 1840. The first people to arrive were mainly Pennsylvania Germans, with a smaller number of families of English descent and a group of French Royalists. This migration from the United States was by 1814 superseded by immigrants from Britain. While many of their predecessors had been agriculturalists, the newer immigrants were highly skilled tradespeople, useful for a growing community.

Among the facilities established by this group were a number of hamlets, the oldest of which was Thornhill, where a sawmill was erected in 1801, a grist mill in 1815, and had a population of 300 by 1836. Other such enclaves included &quot;Kleinburg, Coleraine, Rupertville&quot;&quot;(Maple), Richmond Hill, Teston, Claireville, Pine Grove, Carrville, Patterson, Burlington, Concord, Edgeley, Fisherville, Elder&#x27;s Mills, Elgin Mills, Jefferson, Nashville, Purpleville, Richvale, Sherwood, Langstaff, Vellore&quot;, and &quot;Burwick (Woodbridge)&quot;.

In 1846, the Township was primarily agricultural but had a population of 4,300. There were six grist mills and 25 saw mills. By 1935, there were 4,873 residents.

However, World War II sparked an influx of immigration, and by 1960, the population stood at 15,957. The ethnocultural composition of the area began to change with the arrival of different groups such as Italians, Jews and Eastern Europeans.

Incorporated in 1850 as &quot;Vaughan Township,&quot; a municipal government was established. Vaughan Road was a historic road constructed in 1850 that linked Vaughan Township with Toronto. It incorporated parts of present-day Dufferin Street north of Eglinton Avenue in Toronto, though all that remains of it today is the separate alignment farther south, running through the eastern half of the former City of York. In 1971, the new regional government of York Region was established, acquiring policing and welfare services from the communities it served; simultaneously, the township merged with the Village of Woodbridge to form the Town of Vaughan. In 1991, it changed its legal status to City of Vaughan.

Two F2 tornadoes tore through the city of Vaughan during the Southern Ontario Tornado Outbreak on August 20, 2009. Premier Dalton McGuinty and Mayor Linda Jackson toured the destruction the next day and reported 200 homes in critical shape and as many as 600 additional homes likely to be demolished. The tornadoes also ripped up trees, flipped cars, and left thousands of people without electricity. Vaughan declared a state of emergency because of the widespread damage. No deaths were reported from the tornadoes, but one man who was injured in the storms suffered a heart attack the following morning.

North American telephone customers placing calls to Vaughan may not recognize the charge details on their billings. Although Vaughan has been a single municipality since 1971, the local incumbent local exchange carrier, Bell Canada, splits the city into three historical rate centres–Kleinburg, Maple and Woodbridge. Part of the Thornhill rate centre extends into Vaughan. Indeed, Vaughan does not even appear in the telephone book.

==Mayor and councillors==
Vaughan is governed by a ten-member council comprising a mayor, four regional councillors, and five local councillors. The mayor, elected at large, is the head of the council and a representative on York Region Council. The four regional councillors are also elected at large, and serve on both the city council and York Regional Council. Five local councillors are also elected, one from each of Vaughan&#x27;s five wards, to represent those wards on Vaughan Council.

City councillors meet at Vaughan City Hall, located in Maple. The city&#x27;s City Hall was opened on September 25, 2011, and is named in memory of late Mayor Lorna Jackson. The new Civic Centre is one of the first in Canada to conform to a LEED Gold Standard, the second highest environmental classification available.

Vaughan is the first municipality in Ontario to have a Youth City Councillor. The youth city councillor is appointed as a non-voting member of Council every six months to represent the youth of Vaughan. Vaughan council originally rejected the proposal of a youth councillor but, after the Vaughan Youth Cabinet amended its proposal, Council accepted the recommendation.

After serving as mayor for nine years, Lorna Jackson saw the Town of Vaughan become incorporated as the City of Vaughan. Following the death of Mayor Lorna Jackson in 2002, Michael Di Biase was appointed mayor by Vaughan council by virtue of his position as one of two regional councillors representing Vaughan, Joyce Frustaglio was the other regional councillor. Gino Rosati, a Vaughan local councillor, was subsequently appointed by Vaughan Council to fill Di Biase&#x27;s position as regional councillor and a by-election was held to fill Rosati&#x27;s local councillor&#x27;s position which was won by Linda Jackson, the daughter of Mayor Jackson. Di Biase first became involved in the city&#x27;s politics in 1985, when he was elected as a local councillor in 1985. Di Biase retained the mayorship in the 2003 municipal election, defeating challenger Robert Craig.

In the municipal election on November 13, 2006, Di Biase was narrowly defeated by Linda Jackson, who was sworn in as mayor on December 4, 2006. On June 18, 2008, an audit of Jackson&#x27;s 2006 campaign finances found that the politician exceeded her legal spending limit of $120,419 by at least $12,356, or 10 per cent. The auditors, LECG Canada Ltd., say that amount could almost double if what they believed to be unreported contributions in kind at various election events but couldn&#x27;t prove are later verified.

They also found other apparent contraventions of the Canada Elections Act, including at least five instances where associated companies made donations that exceeded the normal $750 donation limit per company.

On June 24, 2008, Vaughan Council voted unanimously to hire a special prosecutor to consider laying charges against Mayor Linda Jackson under the Municipal Elections Act in reaction to the auditors&#x27; report. Council hired Timothy Wilkin, &quot;an expert in municipal law&quot; to decide what if any charges are to be laid. If Jackson is charged and found guilty, she would face punishments ranging from fines to removal from office.

Subsequently, an audit was conducted on former Mayor Di Biase&#x27;s 2006 election campaign funds. This exposed 27 contraventions under the Elections Act, along with a $155,000 anonymous cash payment made to his lawyer to cover his legal fees. Di Biase has refused to disclose who made this payment.

On 25 October 2010, longtime MP Maurizio Bevilacqua was elected mayor and he assumed office in December 2010.

On 24 October 2022, former Ontario Liberal Party leader Steven Del Duca was elected mayor; he assumed office on November 15, 2022.

== Geography ==
Vaughan is bounded by Caledon and Brampton to the west, King and Richmond Hill to the north, Markham and Richmond Hill to the east, and Toronto — in the dissolved cities of Etobicoke and North York, to the south.

=== Communities and identity===
The city is made up of nearly a dozen historic communities. Likely as a result of the municipality being established when it was still largely a rural area with scattered settlements, most residents (and even non-residents) identify more with the larger communities than they do with the city as a whole and have greatly expanded their areas, and the City officially designates five in the urban area as major communities, with all of the built-up areas of the city considered as being within one of them. This includes corporations such as Bell Canada, which uses the original community rate centres and lists them separately in the phone book, resulting in local calling areas being different throughout the city.

=== Vaughan Metropolitan Centre ===

The Vaughan Metropolitan Centre is a new 179 hectare (442 acre) city centre under development around the intersection of Highway 7 and Jane Street, at the site of the former hamlet of Edgeley.

When the Township of Vaughan officially became a town in 1971, it was made up four historic communities (Maple, Kleinburg, Thornhill, and Woodbridge) large enough to have their own village or town centres. Vaughan committed to building a new business and commercial core distinct from all of them. This commitment became policy in 1998 when Official Plan Amendment 500 called for the Vaughan Corporate Centre, as it was then branded, to become a focal point for business activity and major commercial development.

It is served by the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre subway station, which is the northwestern terminus of Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway system. It is also a major transit hub for York Region Transit (YRT), as well as Viva and Züm bus rapid transit services.

=== Climate ===
Vaughan, like much of the Greater Toronto Area, features a continental climate &quot;Dfb&quot; and has four distinct seasons.

Vaughan was the largest city in Canada without a hospital until the 2021 opening of Cortellucci Vaughan Hospital on Major Mackenzie Drive north of Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. Its planning began in 2007. The provincial government of Ontario approved construction of the hospital in July 2011, and a tender for bids to construct it was issued in 2014 or 2015. Land preparation for construction began in the summer of 2014. Construction on the grounds began in October 2016. The expected date of completion was late 2020. It is part of a regional hospital system with a &quot;single governance, administration and medical staff&quot; managed by Mackenzie Health. The hospital officially opened on 6 June 2021.

==Archaeology==

The Seed-Barker archeological site is a 16th-century Iroquois village on the Humber River in Vaughan. It has been used as a summer school field trip site since 1976 by the Boyd archeological field summer school for high school students. The school is sponsored by the York Region district school board in co-operation with the Royal Ontario Museum and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). In 1895, a local farmer began finding Iroquoian artifacts in the area. In 1895, Roland Orr recognized the classic ecological features favoured by the Iroquoian people for their villages: floodplains along a river, an easily defensible plateau and nearby forests. The Iroquois used the floodplains to plant maize, beans and squash, known as the three sisters. In the 1950s, University of Toronto professor Norman Emerson and the students excavated artifacts from the Seed-Baker site. Since 1975, more than a million artifacts were discovered and nineteen longhouses were excavated revealing that the village was occupied by the Iroquois from c. 1500 - 1550 AD.

<text>Richmond Hill (2021 population: 202,022) is a city in south-central York Region, Ontario, Canada. Part of the Greater Toronto Area, it is the York Region&#x27;s third most populous municipality and the 27th most populous municipality in Canada. Richmond Hill is situated between the cities of Markham and Vaughan, north of Thornhill, and south of Aurora.

Richmond Hill has seen significant population growth since the 1990s. It became a city in 2019 after being a town since 1957. The city is home to the David Dunlap Observatory telescope, the largest telescope in Canada.
==History==

The village of Richmond Hill was incorporated by a bylaw of the York County Council on June 18, 1872, coming into effect January 1, 1873. In September 1956, the Ontario Municipal Board approved its elevation to Town status, effective January 1, 1957.

The Regional Municipality of York was established by Bill 102 &quot;An Act to Establish the Regional Municipality of York&quot; of the provincial parliament, passed on June 26, 1970, and coming into force on January 1, 1971. The act expanded Richmond Hill&#x27;s borders, annexing parts of Whitchurch Township, Markham Township, Vaughan Township and King Township into Richmond Hill, expanding the area covered from to and the population from a little over 19,000 to some 34,000. Historically the town was bounded along a narrow strip along Yonge Street from Lots 48 to 46 (about Crosby Avenue down to Major Mackenzie Drive), as far east as Church Street and slightly west of Mill Pond (excluding Lot 46 where it ended just north of Arnold Crescent or eastern end of today&#x27;s Don Head Park). The town grew to encompass the communities of Gormley, Dollar, Langstaff, Carrville, Headford, Elgin Mills, Jefferson, Bond Lake, Temperanceville, Lake Wilcox, Oak Ridges and Richvale. While Richmond Hill was a prosperous, well developed town, many of the outlying areas annexed were far more rural, with dirt roads, no water mains or sewers and no streetlights, and the time needed to bring municipal services up in these areas, combined with residual unequal tax assessments caused considerable conflict in the municipal politics. Policing was taken over by the York Regional Police, but fire protection remained with Richmond Hill, whose firefighting force quickly grew. Having hired its first full-time employee in 1967, it had fourteen full-time employees by 1971.

Yonge Street through Richmond Hill expanded from two lanes to four in 1971, relieving congestion on what was known as &quot;Ontario&#x27;s worst stretch of highway&quot;.

The Richmond Hill Dynes Jewellers softball team was the 1972 Softball World Champions. The Royal Canadian Air Farce was recorded at the Curtain Club Theatre in Richmond Hill for its first 5 seasons on radio, beginning in 1973. The Air Farce returned for an anniversary recording in the 1990s. Also in 1973 was the centennial of the town&#x27;s incorporation as a village, and the town set up a number of celebratory activities, including a beard growing contest, commissioning a centennial song, a parade, a street dance and the unveiling of a historic plaque honouring the town&#x27;s founding in front of the municipal offices. June 27 was officially declared Russell Lynett Day, named after the town&#x27;s clerk, only the third in its existence. 1973 also saw the sale of the last of the original rose-growing greenhouses in Richmond Hill. Development had led to increasing property taxes and the H.J. Mills greenhouses relocated to Bayview Avenue and Elgin Mill Road. The site of the greenhouses was developed as a subdivision. The fast-growing town set aside significant areas for parks, with five new parks dedicated in 1973, and two more in 1974. The Richmond Hill Historical Society was founded in 1973. The society was dedicated to preserving the history of Richmond Hill and raising awareness of the town&#x27;s history. Their first action was to restore a 150-year-old house, known as the &quot;Burr House&quot;.

As the 1970s went on, the population growth of Richmond Hill remained large. In 1976, home prices in Richmond Hill were among the highest in Canada. By this time, the town council was split over whether to keep expanding rapidly. The deadlock over a fifty-five house subdivision named &quot;Springmills Estate&quot; led to one councillor saying that it was not the reform council it was dubbed, but a &quot;deformed council&quot;. Other housing projects faced similar problems as councillors debated many things, including the need for affordable housing and the encroachment of homes into the farmland and the Oak Ridges Moraine.

GO train service was extended to Richmond Hill in 1978, officially opened on April 29, 1978, by Bill Davis.

Growth in Richmond Hill slowed towards the end of the 1970s, with M.L. McConaghy Public School closing in 1979 due to dropping enrolment. At the same time, Richmond Hill began to make official plans for future land development. The first official plan concerned a industrial park at Leslie Street and Highway 7 named &quot;Beaver Creek&quot;. A commercial area within the park spread into the hamlet of Dollar. The plan was rejected, however, by the Ontario Municipal Board, and Richmond Hill was the first municipality in Ontario to have its official plan rejected outright by the board. The whole affair was subject to much controversy in the community, although the town council eventually declined to appeal the decision.

When the new council convened in 1980, led by new mayor Al Duffy, the town remained without a development plan. The council hired civic planner Peter Walker to produce a new official plan. By September 1981, the new plan was drafted, with limited development of northern Richmond Hill, industrial development centred in the south-east part of town and commercial centres remaining along Yonge Street. The plan was approved in July 1982 by the Ontario Municipal Board.

A clash over the use of the land in Langstaff, known as the &quot;Langstaff Jail Farm&quot; erupted in 1982 between Richmond Hill and Toronto, which owned the land. The plot of land had been acquired by Toronto in 1911, and was unused in 1982. Toronto&#x27;s plans for development clashed with those of Richmond Hill over the balance of industry and residential development, with Richmond Hill favouring more industrial development.

The rose business left Richmond Hill in June 1982, with the closure of H.J. Mills florists. Mills died in 1980, leaving the company to his son, but the poor economic conditions, combined with increasing property taxes in the growing city made the business unprofitable. A 1984 contest organised by &quot;The Liberal&quot; had readers submit entries for a new town slogan. The town council chose three of the submissions which residents then voted on, and &quot;A little north, a little nicer&quot; became Richmond Hill&#x27;s new town slogan.

Richmond Hill&#x27;s growth continued during the 1990s, fuelled in significant part by immigration, with many businesses opened on Highway 7 around Leslie Street serving the new Chinese Community that formed there. In the early 90s, Statistics Canada named Richmond Hill as Canada&#x27;s fastest-growing community.

On March 25, 2019, the Richmond Hill Council passed a motion to change the title of Richmond Hill from &#x27;town&#x27; to &#x27;city&#x27;.

==Politics==
The city&#x27;s motto is &quot;&quot; (French for &quot;Like the rose, I flourish&quot;), reflecting either the motto of the Duke of Richmond, or the fact that the city was a centre of rose-growing in the early 20th century. At that time, it was known as the &quot;Rose Capital&quot; of Canada. A more recent motto for Richmond Hill is &quot;A little north, a little nicer&quot;.

Richmond Hill is the only municipal Canadian government to have light pollution laws in place, due to the presence of the David Dunlap Observatory.

In June 2013, the city&#x27;s council passed a bylaw to ban the number 4 from new street numbers because it is considered to be bad luck in some East Asian cultures.

===Governance===

The city is governed by the Richmond Hill City Council, which operates on a Mayor-Council system with six Ward Councillors and two Regional Councillors, plus the Mayor. The council serves a four-year term, after which a new council is elected by qualified electors in Richmond Hill.

The council derives its authority primarily from the &quot;Municipal Act&quot; and the amendments of the &quot;Municipal Law Amendment Act, 2006&quot;. Richmond Hill is a Lower-tier municipality and has the roles and responsibilities of that position. The municipality has a wide purview relating to the interests of the municipality and its residents to develop and maintain policies, practices and procedures through the issuing of bylaws relating to highways, transportation systems apart from highways, waste management, public utilities, culture, parks, recreation and heritage, drainage and flood control, parking, animals, economic development and the licensing of business. The city is also responsible for maintaining its finances in order to provide relevant services and for maintaining an official plan to guide development.

===Elections===
Elections for municipal offices are held every four years in conjunction with other municipal elections in Ontario. Elected positions include mayor, regional and local councillors and ward councillors (for six different wards) on the Richmond Hill City Council, as well as trustees for the York Region District School Board, the York Catholic District School Board and for Conseilleres (school trustees) for the Conseil scolaire de district du Centre-Sud-Ouest and Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud. The mayor and regional and local councillors also serve on York Regional Council.

The city also has a total of six public swimming pools, including an indoor wave pool. Each summer, the city features a concert series entitled &quot;Concerts in the Park&quot;, each having a specific theme, such as children&#x27;s music and &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; and are held at Mill Pond Park, with some Sunday concerts at Richmond Green Park.

The city is also home to the Richmond Hill Country Club, Summit Golf and Country Club, and the Bloomington Downs Golf Course.

Richmond Hill was awarded the National Communities in Bloom award in 2003, with a special mention about the city&#x27;s floral displays.

Oak Ridges was annexed by Richmond Hill in 1971. It is largely residential, with most commercial development located along Yonge Street. The city developed around Lake Wilcox, the largest lake in the area and a community within Oak Ridges, and has continued to expand slowly since its annexation. In the 1990s, Oak Ridges experienced moderate growth, which has spurred environmental action and anti-development movements by numerous organizations. Population has grown significantly as a result of development initiatives along Bayview Avenue. The Oak Ridges Community Centre was built and completed in June 2012 to accommodate community demand.

St. George&#x27;s family either died or left Canada for France and was the only member to remain in the area. He died in 1896 and is buried at Temperanceville United Church.

The Windham name would disappear after 1860s as Jefferson and Oak Ridges succeeded as new settlements. French Royalist Park in Jefferson is the only reminder of the French settlers.

==Transportation==
===Road networks===

The city of Richmond Hill is well serviced in terms of transportation facilities for a community of its size. The eastern border of the city is Highway 404, a major highway that leads directly into the core of the City of Toronto via the Don Valley Parkway (DVP). Highway 404 also intersects with Highway 401 in North York, which is one of the most traversed highways on the planet and is the principal east–west route in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The city&#x27;s southern border is defined by the former Highway 7 and a parallel toll expressway, Highway 407. The latter is a toll route and was designed as a bypass for the 401. The combined effect of these highways ensures that Richmond Hill is well integrated into Ontario&#x27;s road network and has easy access for all road vehicles. The ease of accessing the city is threatened by increasing traffic due to growth in the region, as the resulting commutes diminish the usefulness of the road network.

===Public transit===

Public transit within the city of Richmond Hill is on buses co-ordinated by York Region Transit (YRT). In September 2005, YRT unveiled a new rapid transit initiative entitled VIVA which provides enhanced bus service on major routes using vehicles capable of speeding up traffic lights to lessen the time they idle. Viva Blue, Viva Purple, Viva Orange, and Viva Pink have stops in Richmond Hill. In addition, YRT operates several feeder routes on secondary streets in the city.

Commuter train service is provided to the city by GO Transit on the Richmond Hill line with four stations in the city, Bloomington Station, Gormley Station, Richmond Hill Station and Langstaff Station. Langstaff Station is near the new Richmond Hill Centre Terminal of York Region Transit at Highway 7 and Yonge Street, and is connected to it by a pedestrian bridge opened in March 2008. The Richmond Hill Centre Terminal is complete with enclosed heating areas, payphones, and credit card/debit card ticket purchasing machines.

Owing to its proximity to Toronto, there are plans to extend Line 1 Yonge-University of the TTC subway system to the intersection of Yonge and Highway 7. The project is in its preliminary planning, design and engineering (PDE) phase, with funding from the federal and provincial governments.

===Other transportation===
Richmond Hill is minimally serviced by other modes of transportation. Its landlocked situation inhibits any water transportation and it lacks an airport of its own, though it does border on Markham&#x27;s Buttonville Airport. The closest international airport is Pearson International Airport.

==Geography and climate==
Richmond Hill is bounded by Bloomington Rd. (Aurora town limit) to the north, York Regional Road 7 (Vaughan city limit west of Yonge St., Markham city limit east of Yonge St.) to the south, Bathurst St. (Vaughan city limit) to the west, and Ontario Highway 404 (Markham city limit) to the east. Its southern limit is about north of the Toronto city limit, Steeles Avenue, and approximately north of the downtown core of Toronto. The city extends north–south and east–west.

The predominant feature of the city&#x27;s geography, as its name suggests, is its elevation above surrounding regions. Thousands of years ago during the last ice-age, glaciers moving in a southerly direction amassed a considerable amount of earth in front of them which they carried forward as they grew. Gradually, as the temperature increased the growth of the glaciers lessened and eventually they began to recede to what is now the polar ice cap. The earth that had been collected by the glacier&#x27;s movement was left in place and the elevated region that remained comprises modern day Richmond Hill.

The city itself is at a much greater elevation than other communities within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and with the exclusion of areas closely alongside its borders, the constituent of York region with the greatest height above sea level. The uneven melting of the glacier that formed the city has led to an extremely varied geography within the city&#x27;s own borders, leading to such features as kettle lakes, minor tributaries and most notably the Oak Ridges Moraine.

Kettle lakes are the result of glacier water getting caught in water-tight depressions in the land and are sustained by only rainfall in the immediate area. The City of Richmond Hill has many of these water bodies and its three largest in order of decreasing size are Lake Wilcox, Bond Lake and Philips Lake. The kettle lakes are predominantly confined to the northern fringes of the city.

Being elevated above the surrounding region, precipitation in the city tends to flow outwards via the multitude of streams and rivers that flow through the city. Principally water flow is in one of two directions, south to Lake Ontario or north to Lake Simcoe where they join up with larger tributaries that feed into the water bodies. Of note are the Rouge, Humber, and Don rivers, which receive some of their flow from sources in the city.

Perhaps the most important geographical feature of the City of Richmond Hill is the Oak Ridges Moraine. The moraine is a further elevated region of loose soil which comprises a significant portion (roughly the northern third) of the land area of the city. Its porous nature allows the collection and natural filtering of waters that flow through it which are then fed into multiple underground aquifers. While the city receives its water from the City of Toronto, these aquifers are an important source for those with their own wells in addition to surrounding communities. The ability of the soil to hold so much water means that despite Richmond Hill&#x27;s comparatively high elevation, it has a very high water table which poses some problems to construction. The moraine is also host to a staggering amount of biodiversity and in recent years there has been a considerable amount of pressure applied to government to shield the area from development. Consequently, a considerable portion of Richmond Hill is subject to the Ontario Government&#x27;s Greenbelt legislation.

<text>John Gilpin was featured as the subject in a well-known comic ballad of 1782 by William Cowper, entitled &quot;The Diverting History of John Gilpin&quot;. Cowper had heard the story from his friend Lady Austen.

Gilpin was said to be a wealthy draper from Cheapside in London, who owned land at Olney, Buckinghamshire, near where Cowper lived. It is likely that he was a Mr Beyer, a linen draper of the Cheapside corner of Paternoster Row. The poem tells how Gilpin and his wife and children became separated during a journey to the Bell Inn, Edmonton, after Gilpin loses control of his horse which bolts and carries him ten miles farther to the town of Ware.
A number of sites commemorate the exploits of John Gilpin, most notably Gilpin&#x27;s Gallop, a street in the village of Stanstead St Margarets. This was said to have been on the original route taken by the horse and his unfortunate rider.

&quot;John Gilpin&#x27;s Ghost&quot; was a ballad (1795) by John Thelwall. The &quot;John Gilpin&quot; clipper of 1852 was also named after him. A former public house in Cambridge was named John Gilpin. A sculpture by Angela Godfrey, which was inspired by Cowper&#x27;s poem about Gilpin now sits in Fore Street, Edmonton, London.

<text>José Cecilio Díaz del Valle (November 22, 1780 – March 2, 1834) was a philosopher, politician, lawyer, and journalist and one of the most important figures in Central America during the transition from colonial government to independence, displaying a wide-ranging expertise in public administration management.

Valle nicknamed &#x27;The Wise&#x27; was also, one of Central America&#x27;s founding fathers.

==Personal life==

===Early years===
José Cecilio del Valle was born on November 22, 1780, in the village of Choluteca, located near the Choluteca River. This village belonged to the former province of Tegucigalpa (now Honduras), during the Spanish domination. He was the legitimate son of Jose Antonio del Valle and Gertrudis Díaz del Valle. Both members of the most distinguished Spanish families of the Kingdom of Guatemala. who, therefore, have obtained the main political and military jobs. Their wealth consisted mainly of valuable estates of livestock. But that wasn&#x27;t enough to provide their favorite son with a good education. Tegucigalpa lacked good schools, the only ones available were supported by private donations. Given this situation, Jose Antonio del Valle had to move his family to Guatemala City, where he hoped young Jose would be better formed. Jose Cecilio was only 9 years old when he arrived in Guatemala.

==Education==
In Guatemala City he attended the University of San Carlos where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1794. Then in 1799 he earned a degree in civil and canonical law and a licentiate degree in law in 1803. His mentor was Father José Antonio Liendo y Goycochea.

==Politics==
In 1821 he was elected mayor of Guatemala City, position he held until June (1821). The same year Central America became independent from Spanish rule. Jose del Valle was the one who wrote the Act of Independence of Central America. Up to this date, there is a controversy in relation to this document because del Valle did not sign it. Most historians however, agreed that he was not supposed to sign such document. In 1822 Central America became part of the short lived Mexican Empire under Agustin de Iturbide.

Valle was elected a &#x27;Guatemalan Representative&#x27; before the Mexican Congress. On August 27, 1822. Valle was imprisoned along with other representatives on charges of conspiring against the Mexicans.
After months in prison (February 1823), he was released and appointed Foreign Minister for the Mexican Government. The same year Central America gained its independence from Mexico. In January 1824 he returned to Guatemala where was part of the second triumvirate that governed the Provinces of Central America.

In 1825 José del Valle ran for president of the Federal Republic of Central America against Manuel José Arce. Apparently he won the election obtaining more votes. But Congress had a different interpretation. The candidates went to second round and Arce was declared winner. Following his defeat, Valle retired from politics and devoted himself to writing.

In 1830 President Francisco Morazán offered him to be ambassador to France, and or the Vice presidency. He declined both and instead went on to become Director of the Economic Society and Director of San Carlos University&#x27;s Fine Arts department.

==Correspondence==
Jeremy Bentham and Valle corresponded. Before his death, Bentham sent a lock of his hair to Valle.

==Death==
In 1834 he defeated incumbent Francisco Morazán in the general election but never took over the presidency. He died on the road that leads from the farm &quot;La Concepción&quot; to Guatemala City, on March 2, 1834. Where he was supposed to be treated for an illness. The government decreed three days of mourning after his death. His death was marked by national mourning and bells tolling throughout the Republic, as he was one of the few prominent figures respected by Liberals and Conservatives alike.

==Legacy==

The Honduran Government awards a medal for distinguished service named &quot;Orden Civil José Cecilio del Valle&quot;, and there is a University named after him in Tegucigalpa.

The November 22 is holiday because of his Birthday.

Honduras has featured Valle on its 100 Lempira banknote since 1951.

A later family member of Jose Cecilo was Jorge Del Valle Zamora and was ambassador of Honduras to Mexico in the 20th century.

<text>Arne Frode Rinnan is the former captain of the MV Tampa, which in 2001 was refused access to Australia to disembark 433 rescued refugees - in what became known as the Tampa affair. Rinnan and his crew were awarded the Nansen Refugee Award in 2002.

== Early life ==
Rinnan was born on 10 November 1940 in Oslo, Norway) to parents, Louise Mari &quot;Lillemor&quot; Devold and Frode Rinnan, who moved from Ålesund in 1939.

== Career ==

Rinnan worked as the captain of the MV Tampa owned by Norwegian shipping line Wallenius Wilhelmsen.

=== Tampa Affair ===
On 26 August 2001, the MV Tampa was on its way from Fremantle in Australia to Singapore, when the Australian Maritime Safety Authority requested the crew to go to the aid of &quot;The Palapa,&quot; a 25-meter vessel in distress that was transporting 433 refugees. The crew rescued the refugees, most of whom were Hazara Afghans, along with Pakistanis and Sri Lankans. Captain Rinnan directed his ship towards the nearest port, in Indonesia, but some refugees broke into the bridge and forced him to proceed to Christmas Island in Australian waters. The MV Tampa arrived at Christmas Island on August 27, but Australian authorities blocked the refugees from disembarking; the refugees subsequently went on hunger strike. Contrary to instructions from the Australian authorities, Rinnan moved the MV Tampa further into Australian territorial waters. Australian armed forces boarded the vessel and demanded a change of course towards international waters, but Rinnan refused, citing the health needs of the refugees. The Norwegian government publicly rebuked the Australian government for its actions.

On August 30, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson urged the Australian government to allow the disembarkation of the refugees. Australian Prime Minister John Howard robustly rejected the request, but proposed a compromise that saw the refugees being transported to Nauru, via Papua New Guinea. The crisis ended on September 2, 2001.

=== Tampa Affair aftermath ===
In 2001, Rinnan was made a knight of the 1st class of Royal Norwegian Order of Merit and was named &quot;Captain of the Year&quot; by the British Nautical Institute and Lloyds&#x27; List shipping journal. Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet named Rinnan the 2001 &quot;Name of the Year&quot;. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees awarded Rinnan and his crew the Nansen Refugee Prize for 2002.

In 2002, Rinnan his crew were awarded the Norwegian &quot;Medaljen for redningsdåd til sjøs&quot; . (English &quot;Medal for Sea Rescue&quot;)

Arne Rinnan retired from his position as captain in 2002.

== Personal life ==
Rinnan lives with his family in the city of Kongsberg.

<text>The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are referred to as the synoptic Gospels because they include many of the same stories, often in a similar sequence and in similar or sometimes identical wording. They stand in contrast to John, whose content is largely distinct. The term &quot;synoptic&quot; (; ) comes via Latin from the Greek , &quot;synopsis&quot;, i.e. &quot;(a) seeing all together, synopsis&quot;. The modern sense of the word in English is of &quot;giving an account of the events from the same point of view or under the same general aspect&quot;. It is in this sense that it is applied to the synoptic gospels.

This strong parallelism among the three gospels in content, arrangement, and specific language is widely attributed to literary interdependence, though the role of orality and memorization of sources has also been explored by scholars. The question of the precise nature of their literary relationship—the synoptic problem—has been a topic of debate for centuries and has been described as &quot;the most fascinating literary enigma of all time&quot;. While no conclusive solution has been found yet, the longstanding majority view favors Marcan priority, in which both Matthew and Luke have made direct use of the Gospel of Mark as a source, and further holds that Matthew and Luke also drew from an additional hypothetical document, called &quot;Q&quot;.

== Structure ==

=== Common features ===

Broadly speaking, the synoptic gospels are similar to John: all are composed in Koine Greek, have a similar length, and were completed in less than a century after Jesus&#x27; death. They also differ from non-canonical sources, such as the Gospel of Thomas, in that they belong to the ancient genre of biography, collecting not only Jesus&#x27; teachings, but recounting in an orderly way his origins, his ministry, and his passion, and alleged miracles, and resurrection.

In content and in wording, though, the synoptics diverge widely from John but have a great deal in common with each other. Though each gospel includes some unique material, the majority of Mark and roughly half of Matthew and Luke coincide in content, in much the same sequence, often nearly verbatim. This common material is termed the &quot;triple tradition&quot;.

=== Triple tradition ===

The triple tradition, the material included by all three synoptic gospels, includes many stories and teachings:

The triple tradition&#x27;s pericopae (passages) tend to be arranged in much the same order in all three gospels. This stands in contrast to the material found in only two of the gospels, which is much more variable in order.

The classification of text as belonging to the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather on the degree of similarity demanded. Matthew and Mark report the cursing of the fig tree, a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. In Luke, the only parable of the barren fig tree is in a different point of the narrative. Some would say that Luke has extensively adapted an element of the triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.

==== Example ====

An illustrative example of the three texts in parallel is the healing of the leper:

More than half the wording in this passage is identical. Each gospel includes words absent in the other two and omits something included by the other two.

=== Relation to Mark ===

The triple tradition itself constitutes a complete gospel quite similar to the shortest gospel, Mark.

Mark, unlike Matthew and Luke, adds little to the triple tradition. Pericopae unique to Mark are scarce, notably two healings involving saliva and the naked runaway. Mark&#x27;s additions within the triple tradition tend to be explanatory elaborations (e.g., &quot;the stone was rolled back, ) or Aramaisms (e.g., &quot;&quot;Talitha kum&quot;!&quot;). The pericopae Mark shares with only Luke are also quite few: the Capernaum exorcism and departure from Capernaum, the strange exorcist, and the widow&#x27;s mites. A greater number, but still not many, are shared with only Matthew, most notably the so-called &quot;Great Omission&quot; from Luke of .

Most scholars take these observations as a strong clue to the literary relationship among the synoptics and Mark&#x27;s special place in that relationship, though various scholars suggest an entirely oral relationship or a dependence emphasizing memory and tradents in a tradition rather than simple copying. The Gospels represent a Jesus tradition and were enveloped by oral storytelling and performances during the early years of Christianity, rather than being redactions or literary responses to each other. The hypothesis favored by most experts is &quot;Marcan priority&quot;, whereby Mark was composed first, and Matthew and Luke each used Mark, incorporating much of it, with adaptations, into their own gospels. Alan Kirk praises Matthew in particular for his &quot;scribal memory competence&quot; and &quot;his high esteem for and careful handling of both Mark and Q&quot;, which makes claims the latter two works are significantly different in terms of theology or historical reliability dubious. A leading alternative hypothesis is &quot;Marcan posteriority&quot;, with Mark having been formed primarily by extracting what Matthew and Luke shared in common.

=== Double tradition ===

 An extensive set of material—some two hundred verses, or roughly half the length of the triple tradition—are the pericopae shared between Matthew and Luke, but absent in Mark. This is termed the &quot;double tradition&quot;. Parables and other sayings predominate in the double tradition, but also included are narrative elements:
Unlike triple tradition material, double tradition material is structured differently in the two gospels. Matthew&#x27;s lengthy Sermon on the Mount, for example, is paralleled by Luke&#x27;s shorter Sermon on the Plain, with the remainder of its content scattered throughout Luke. This is consistent with the general pattern of Matthew collecting sayings into large blocks, while Luke does the opposite and intersperses them with narrative.

Besides the double tradition proper, Matthew and Luke often agree against Mark within the triple tradition to varying extents, sometimes including several additional verses, sometimes differing by a single word. These are termed the &quot;major and minor agreements&quot; (the distinction is imprecise). One example is in the passion narrative, where Mark has simply, &quot;Prophesy!&quot; while Matthew and Luke both add, &quot;Who is it that struck you?&quot;

The double tradition&#x27;s origin, with its major and minor agreements, is a key facet of the synoptic problem. The simplest hypothesis is Luke relied on Matthew&#x27;s work or vice versa. But many experts, on various grounds, maintain that neither Matthew nor Luke used the other&#x27;s work. If this is the case, they must have drawn from some common source, distinct from Mark, that provided the double-tradition material and overlapped with Mark&#x27;s content where major agreements occur. This hypothetical document is termed &quot;Q&quot;, for the German &quot;Quelle&quot;, meaning &quot;source&quot;.

=== Special Matthew and Special Luke ===

Matthew and Luke contain a large amount of material found in no other gospel. These materials are sometimes called &quot;Special Matthew&quot; or &quot;M&quot; and &quot;Special Luke&quot; or &quot;L&quot;.

Both Special Matthew and Special Luke include distinct opening infancy narratives and post-resurrection conclusions (with Luke continuing the story in his second book Acts). In between, Special Matthew includes mostly parables, while Special Luke includes both parables and healings.

Special Luke is notable for containing a greater concentration of Semitisms than any other gospel material.

Luke gives some indication of how he composed his gospel in his prologue:

Since many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, I too decided, after investigating everything carefully from the very first, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed.

== Synoptic problem ==

The &quot;synoptic problem&quot; is the question of the specific literary relationship among the three synoptic gospels—that is, the question as to the source or sources upon which each synoptic gospel depended when it was written.

The texts of the three synoptic gospels often agree very closely in wording and order, both in quotations and in narration. Most scholars ascribe this to &quot;documentary dependence&quot;, direct or indirect, meaning the close agreements among synoptic gospels are due to one gospel&#x27;s drawing from the text of another, or from some written source that another gospel also drew from.

=== Controversies ===
The synoptic problem hinges on several interrelated points of controversy:
* Priority: Which gospel was written first? (If one text draws from another, the source must have been composed first.)
* Successive dependence: Did each of the synoptic gospels draw from each of its predecessors? (If not, the frequent agreements between the two independent gospels against the third must originate elsewhere.)
* Lost written sources: Did any of the gospels draw from some earlier document which has not been preserved (e.g., the hypothetical &quot;Q&quot;, or from earlier editions of other gospels)?
* Oral sources: To what extent did each evangelist or literary collaborator draw from personal knowledge, eyewitness accounts, liturgy, or other oral traditions to produce an original written account?
* Translation: Jesus and others quoted in the gospels spoke primarily in Aramaic, but the gospels themselves in their oldest available form are each written in Koine Greek. Who performed the translations, and at what point?
* Redaction: How and why did those who put the gospels into their final form expand, abridge, alter, or rearrange their sources?

Some theories try to explain the relation of the synoptic gospels to John; to non-canonical gospels such as Thomas, Peter, and Egerton; to the Didache; and to lost documents such as the Hebrew logia mentioned by Papias, the Jewish–Christian gospels, and the Gospel of Marcion.

=== History ===

Ancient sources virtually unanimously ascribe the synoptic gospels to the apostle Matthew, to Mark, and to Luke—hence their respective canonical names. The ancient authors, however, did not agree on which order the Gospels had been written. For example, Clement of Alexandria held that Matthew wrote first, Luke wrote second and Mark wrote third; on the other hand, Origen argued that Matthew wrote first, Mark wrote second and Luke wrote third; Tertullian states that John and Matthew were published first and that Mark and Luke came later; and Irenaeus precedes all these and orders his famous &#x27;four pillar story&#x27; by John, Luke, Matthew, and Mark.

A remark by Augustine of Hippo at the beginning of the fifth century presents the gospels as composed in their canonical order (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), with each evangelist thoughtfully building upon and supplementing the work of his predecessors—the Augustinian hypothesis (Matthew–Mark).

This view (when any model of dependence was considered at all) seldom came into question until the late eighteenth century, when Johann Jakob Griesbach published in 1776 a &quot;synopsis&quot; of the synoptic gospels. Instead of harmonizing them, he displayed their texts side by side, making both similarities and divergences apparent. Griesbach, noticing the special place of Mark in the synopsis, hypothesized Marcan posteriority and advanced (as Henry Owen had a few years earlier) the two-gospel hypothesis (Matthew–Luke).

In the nineteenth century, researchers applied the tools of literary criticism to the synoptic problem in earnest, especially in German scholarship. Early work revolved around a hypothetical proto-gospel (&quot;Ur-Gospel&quot;), possibly in Aramaic, underlying the synoptics. From this line of inquiry, however, a consensus emerged that Mark itself served as the principal source for the other two gospels—Marcan priority.

In a theory first proposed by Christian Hermann Weisse in 1838, the double tradition was explained by Matthew and Luke independently using two sources—thus, the two-source (Mark–Q) theory—which supplemented Mark with another hypothetical source consisting mostly of sayings. This additional source was at first seen as the &quot;logia&quot; (sayings) spoken of by Papias and thus called &quot;Λ&quot;, but later it became more generally known as &quot;Q&quot;, from the German &quot;Quelle&quot;, meaning &quot;source&quot;. This two-source theory eventually won wide acceptance and was seldom questioned until the late twentieth century; most scholars simply took this new orthodoxy for granted and directed their efforts toward Q itself, and this is largely the case.

The theory is also well known in a more elaborate form set forth by Burnett Hillman Streeter in 1924, which additionally hypothesized written sources &quot;M&quot; and &quot;L&quot; (for &quot;Special Matthew&quot; and &quot;Special Luke&quot; respectively)—hence the influential four-document hypothesis. This exemplifies the prevailing scholarship of the time, which saw the canonical gospels as late products, dating from well into the second century, composed by unsophisticated cut-and-paste redactors out of a progression of written sources, and derived in turn from oral traditions and from folklore that had evolved in various communities. 

In recent decades, weaknesses of the two-source theory have been more widely recognized, and debate has reignited. Many have independently argued that Luke did make some use of Matthew after all. British scholars went further and dispensed with Q entirely, ascribing the double tradition to Luke&#x27;s direct use of Matthew—the Farrer hypothesis of 1955. New attention is also being given (for example, by Robert MacEwen and Alan Garrow) to the Wilke hypothesis of 1838 which, like Farrer, dispenses with Q but ascribes the double tradition to Matthew&#x27;s direct use of Luke (Matthean Posteriority). Meanwhile, the Augustinian hypothesis has also made a comeback, especially in American scholarship. The Jerusalem school hypothesis has also attracted fresh advocates, as has the Independence hypothesis, which denies documentary relationships altogether.

On this collapse of consensus, Wenham observed: &quot;I found myself in the Synoptic Problem Seminar of the Society for New Testament Studies, whose members were in disagreement over every aspect of the subject. When this international group disbanded in 1982 they had sadly to confess that after twelve years&#x27; work they had not reached a common mind on a single issue.&quot;

More recently, Andris Abakuks applied a statistical time series approach to the Greek texts to determine the relative likelihood of these proposals. Models without Q fit reasonably well. Matthew and Luke were statistically dependent on their borrowings from Mark. This suggests at least one of Matthew and Luke had access to the other&#x27;s work. The most likely synoptic gospel to be the last was Luke. The least likely was Mark. While this weighs against the Griesbach proposal and favors the Farrer, he does not claim any proposals are ruled out.

=== Conclusions ===
No definitive solution to the Synoptic Problem has been found yet. The two-source hypothesis, which was dominant throughout the 20th century, still enjoys the support of most New Testament scholars; however, it has come under substantial attack in recent years by a number of biblical scholars, who have attempted to relaunch the Augustinian hypothesis, the Griesbach hypothesis and the Farrer hypothesis.

In particular, the existence of the Q source has received harsh criticism in the first two decades of the 21st century: scholars such as Mark Goodacre and Brant Pitre have pointed out that no manuscript of Q has ever been found, nor is any reference to Q ever made in the writings of the Church Fathers (or any ancient writings, in fact). This has prompted E. P. Sanders and Margaret Davies to write that the Two-sources hypothesis, while still dominant, &quot;is least satisfactory&quot; and Fr. Joseph Fitzmyer to state that the Synoptic Problem is &quot;practically insoluble&quot;.

=== Theories ===

Nearly every conceivable theory has been advanced as a solution to the synoptic problem. The most notable theories include:

<text>Getting There is a 2002 American adventure comedy film starring Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

==Plot==
Taylor (Ashley Olsen) and Kylie Hunter (Mary-Kate Olsen) are celebrating their 16th birthday and are licensed to drive. They plan a trip to Salt Lake City, Utah with their friends for the 2002 Winter Olympics. When they stop at a local restaurant on the way, their car is stolen and next they board the wrong plane to San Diego. Determined to make it to Utah in time for the Olympics, the teenagers take a coach from LA to Vegas, but get separated at a gas station. Kylie and half of the gang makes it to Vegas, where they end up taking part in a Vegas wedding, whilst Taylor and the other half of the gang are stranded in a one horse town.

While trying to get ahold of her sister, Taylor meets Charly, a girl her age with a pick-up truck who offers to give her and her friends a ride to Vegas, but her truck breaks down. Charly reveals that she, who seemed like a humble farm girl, actually lives in a mansion and owns a private jet. Her dad offers to fly all of the teens to Salt Lake City.

Taylor and Kylie arrive in Utah too late for the Olympics. Taylor is upset because she would have liked to see her favourite Athlete, Alex Reisher, compete. Nonetheless, the friends decide to have fun by holding their own Olympics. Taylor meets a young man and they end up spending the day skiing together, but she never sees his face.

<doc id="221970" wikidata="Q234746" url="?curid=221970" title="Sarah Siddons">
<text>Sarah Siddons (&quot;née&quot; Kemble; 5 July 1755 – 8 June 1831) was a Welsh actress, the best-known tragedienne of the 18th century. Contemporaneous critic William Hazlitt dubbed Siddons as &quot;tragedy personified&quot;.

She was the elder sister of John Philip Kemble, Charles Kemble, Stephen Kemble, Ann Hatton, and Elizabeth Whitlock, and the aunt of Fanny Kemble. She was most famous for her portrayal of the Shakespearean character Lady Macbeth, a character she made her own.

The Sarah Siddons Society, founded in 1952, continues to present the Sarah Siddons Award annually in Chicago to a distinguished actress.

== Background ==
The 18th-century marked the &quot;emergence of a recognisably modern celebrity culture&quot; and Siddons was at the heart of it. Portraits depicted actresses in aristocratic dress, the recently industrialised newspapers spread actresses&#x27; names and images and gossip about their private lives spread through the public. Though few people had actually seen Siddons perform, her name had been circulated to such an extent that when it was announced &quot;the crowd behaved as if they knew her already&quot;. 

Actresses playing and acting like aristocrats decreased the difference in the public&#x27;s eyes between actresses and aristocrats and many earned large amounts of money. Despite this giving actresses a larger amount of control, women were still viewed as &quot;extreme representations of femininity - they were good or bad, comic or tragic, prostitutes or virgins, mistresses or mothers&quot;. Their on-stage roles and personal biographies blurred - leading many actresses to use these extreme representations of femininity to create a persona that could be viewed both on and off stage.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Siddons was born Sarah Kemble in Brecon, Brecknockshire, Wales, the eldest daughter of Roger Kemble, a Roman Catholic, and Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Ward, a Protestant. Sarah and her sisters were raised in their mother&#x27;s faith and her brothers were raised in their father&#x27;s faith. Roger Kemble was the manager of a touring theatre company, the Warwickshire Company of Comedians.

Although the theatre company included most members of the Kemble family, Siddons&#x27; parents initially disapproved of her choice of profession. At that time, acting was only beginning to become a respectable profession for a woman.

From 1770 until her marriage in 1773, Siddons served as a lady&#x27;s maid and later as companion to Lady Mary Bertie Greatheed at Guy&#x27;s Cliffe near Warwick. Lady Greatheed was the daughter of the Duke of Ancaster; her son, Bertie Greatheed, was a dramatist who continued the family&#x27;s friendship with Siddons.

===Early career: Before success in London ===

In 1774, Siddons won her first success as Belvidera in Thomas Otway&#x27;s &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot;. This brought her to the attention of David Garrick, who sent his deputy to see her as Calista in Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Fair Penitent&quot;, the result being that she was engaged to appear at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Owing to inexperience as well as other circumstances, her first appearances as Portia and in other parts were not well received and she received a note from the manager of Drury Lane stating that her services would not be required. She was, in her own words, &quot;banished from Drury Lane as a worthless candidate for fame and fortune&quot;.

After she was released from Drury Lane, Siddons was immediately engaged by Richard Yates, manager of the Theatre Royal Birmingham. During the summer of 1776, John Henderson would see Siddons perform. He was immediately struck with her excellence, and pronounced that she would never be surpassed. He did more than this; he wrote directly to Palmer, manager of the Theatre Royal Bath, to advise an engagement of her without delay. Due to there being no available roles for Siddons at the time of Henderson&#x27;s letter, Palmer could not immediately attend to his advice.

In 1777, she went on &quot;the circuit&quot; in the provinces. For the next six years she worked in provincial companies, in particular York and Bath. Her first appearance at Bath&#x27;s Old Orchard Street Theatre was in autumn 1778 at a salary of £3 per week (, or approximately $). This amount grew as her performances became better known, and as she began to appear in Bristol at the Theatre Royal, King Street (which now houses the Bristol Old Vic), also run by John Palmer. Siddons lived with her husband and children in a Georgian house at 33 The Paragon in Bath, until her final performance there in May 1782.

To say farewell to Bristol and Bath, Siddons presented her famous &#x27;three reasons&#x27; speech. In a speech of her own writing, Siddons literally presented her three children as her three reasons for leaving. She said &#x27;These are the moles that bear me from your side; / Where I was rooted - where I could have died. / Stand forth, ye elves, and plead your mother&#x27;s cause&#x27; The full speech was published in the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette, 4th July 1782. 

The presentation of her own motherhood was something she used throughout her career, notably when she performed her next Drury Lane appearance, on 10 October 1782, which could not have been more different from her debut performances. She was an immediate sensation playing the title role in Garrick&#x27;s adaptation of a play by Thomas Southerne, &quot;Isabella, or, The Fatal Marriage&quot;. So good was she that &quot;Her pathetic embodiment of domestic woe created a sensation, flooding the audience with tears and exciting critics to hyperbolic praise.&quot;

=== Mid-career: Notable roles ===
Siddons continued to act in the provinces, appearing at The Theatre, Leeds, in 1786 and consistently brought a thorough understanding to each of her roles. It was through her portrayals of Lady Macbeth and Isabella, particularly, that Siddons offered a new way of approaching character. Siddons has been credited for inventing and promoting textual accuracy above the theatrical traditions of her time: &quot;Siddons was unique for making herself familiar with the entire script, sitting offstage in order to hear the full play, and paying careful attention to her scene partners and to textual clues that could aid performance.&quot;

Her most famous role was that of Lady Macbeth, which she first performed on 2 February 1785. She spellbound her audience through the grandeur of her emotions as she expressed Lady Macbeth&#x27;s murderous passions. Rather than portraying Lady Macbeth as a murderous evil queen, Siddons depicted her with a strong sense of maternity and a delicate femininity. 

As she noted in her own &quot;Remarks to the character of Lady Macbeth&quot;, Siddons found an unearthed fragility in this role. &quot;She read, in the &#x27;I have given suck&#x27; soliloquy, a &#x27;tender allusion [to] the maternal mother yearning for her babe&#x27;; it is therefore in Lady Macbeth that Siddons found the highest and best scope for her acting abilities. She was tall and had a striking figure, brilliant beauty, powerfully expressive eyes, and solemn dignity of demeanour which enabled her to claim the character as her own.&quot;

After Lady Macbeth she played Desdemona, Rosalind, Ophelia, and Volumnia, all with great success; but it was as Queen Catherine in &quot;Henry VIII&quot; that she discovered a part almost as well adapted to her acting powers as that of Lady Macbeth. She once told Samuel Johnson that Catherine was her favourite role, as it was the most natural.

====The role of Hamlet====
Sarah Siddons played the role of Hamlet multiple times over three decades. By the early nineteenth century, &quot;Hamlet had become arguably Shakespeare&#x27;s most iconic character&quot;. Her choice to tackle this role was fascinating as cross gendered roles were &quot;generally more difficult and demanding than a breeches role&quot;. The performer would need to sustain the illusion for the whole duration of the play as opposed to a breeches role which is much more brief and gained comedic success from the character&#x27;s poor delivery at representing the opposite sex. 

Far from a one-off curiosity, &quot;Siddons played Hamlet repeatedly, if sporadically, for three decades, always in the provinces and never in London, until she reached the age of fifty&quot;. Sarah Siddons first played Hamlet in Worcester in 1775 and then in Manchester opposite her brother John Philip Kemble as Laertes March 1777. At the Bristol theatre, she played Hamlet in 1781. She went on to repeat the role in Liverpool. In Dublin, she played Hamlet during the season of 1802-03 and once more in 1805. She proposed that last performance to her friend and fellow actor William Galindo as a revival of their successful 1802 performance, with herself as Hamlet and Galindo as Laertes. This 1805 revival production made enough of an impression to be caricatured in The Dublin Satirist five years later in 1810.

=== Celebrity status ===

==== Celebrity persona and the &quot;Female Star&quot; ====
It was the beginning of twenty years in which she became the undisputed Queen of Drury Lane. Her celebrity status was called &quot;mythical&quot; and &quot;monumental&quot;, and by the mid-1780s Siddons had established herself as a cultural icon. Yet her iconography and the fashioning of her celebrity differed greatly in comparison to her female counterparts. Siddons, according to Laura Engel, invented a new category of femininity for actresses: the &quot;Female Star&quot;. By &quot;cleverly blurring the distinction between the characters she played on stage with representations of herself offstage (as much portraiture of the period invokes)&quot; Siddons was able to present a duality to her admirers. At once she would project both the &quot;divine and the ordinary, domestic and authoritative, fantastic and real&quot;.

She avoided claims of sexual licentiousness, and the only damage to her career was faced toward its end, when caricatures and satirical prints emerged detailing the physical decline and stoutness of her body. Shearer West, in an analysis of the collapse of Siddons&#x27; private and public personas, wrote that Siddons&#x27; brother, the actor-manager John Philip Kemble, &quot;substantially rewrote passages in some of the plays in order to temper any indelicacy [and] transcend sexual indiscretions&quot; that could harm her reputation of feminine propriety.

Siddons had a unique ability to control her own celebrity persona and &quot;manipulate her public image through a variety of visual materials&quot;. Some scholars believe that although Siddons&#x27; fame and success appeared effortless, it was in fact &quot;a highly constructed process&quot;. This left her successful, yet fatigued as she was &quot;always aware of the ultimate power of her audiences to approve of her or destroy her&quot;. In being aware of her position in the public eye, Siddons &quot;carefully selected the roles in which she appeared and assiduously cultivated her domestic image&quot;. 

She would only choose roles which could aid her popularity and protect her image. By cleverly blurring the distinction between the characters she played on stage and her presentation offstage, Siddons combined her maternal persona with depictions of British femininity. This allowed her to avoid the same reproach and scandal as other actresses of the time. For example, Siddons used her role of Isabella, a sacrificing mother, to frame her &quot;rise to stardom in terms of her maternal roles on stage and off stage&quot;. 

In performing these domestic moments with the result of public triumph, Siddons was able to reiterate the characteristics that made her such a popular celebrity and icon; &quot;her devotion to her family and her humble, behind-the-scenes existence&quot;. Siddons&#x27; role off stage, then, appears to be that of the ordinary wife and mother and this was crucial in a time when women were expected to stay at home, rather than provide for their family. Overall, her choice of roles and carefully constructed persona meant Siddons was able to live out the entirety of her career with little to no public scandal.

==== Acting power ====
Theatre biographer Henry Barton Baker wrote: 

On the night of 2 May 1797, Sarah Siddons&#x27;s character of Agnes in George Lillo&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Curiosity&quot; suggested murder with &quot;an expression in her face that made the flesh of the spectator creep.&quot; In the audience was Henry Crabb Robinson, whose respiration grew difficult. Robinson went into a fit of hysterics and was nearly ejected from the theatre. This &#x27;Siddons Fever&#x27; was a common occurrence with Richards even suggesting it was part of the amusement: &quot;The theatrical vogue for the audience to shriek whatever the heroine did originated with Sarah. The &#x27;Siddons fever&#x27;, which &#x27;raised the price of salts and hartshorn&#x27;, often included fits of fainting, hysterics and physical paroxysms as part of the enjoyment.&quot;

Siddons occasionally gave public readings of plays, and the Scottish poet/playwright Joanna Baillie recorded her thoughts of several performances given in 1813. Despite her reservations about Siddon&#x27;s &quot;frequent bursts of voice beyond what natural passion warranted,&quot; Baillie wrote to Sir Walter Scott, &quot;take it all in all was fine &amp; powerful acting; and when it has ceased &quot;we&quot; of this generation can never look to see the like again.&quot;

==== Portrait as &quot;The Tragic Muse&quot; ====
Commissioned and completed in 1784, Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27; portrait, &quot;Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse&quot;, is characterized by Reynolds&#x27; inspiration, contextualisation of the Muse, and distinctive brush work and paint palette. This portrait, as Heather McPherson writes, became the known depiction of tragedy, infused with contemporary ideas about acting and representation of the passions in Siddons&#x27; melancholy expression and deportment. Mary Hamilton&#x27;s correspondence with her fiancé illuminated its seamless transition from &quot;the artist&#x27;s studio to the theatrical stage&quot;, practical venues that interlocked in the eighteenth century and formed a large part in creating the very idea of celebrity. The interest in the portrait was so great that William Smith&#x27;s house was transformed into a quasi-public gallery following his acquisition of the painting.

William Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Siddons and Her Son, in The Tragedy of Isabella&quot; gained much traction due to the mutually beneficial relationship between painter and actress. Hamilton had sold his painting for £150 before it was exhibited at the Royal Academy, though kept the painting there for over a week and placed advertisements in at least three leading newspapers inviting the public to view it. A contemporary biographer recalled &quot;carriages thronged to the artist&#x27;s door; and, if every fine lady who stepped out of them did not actually weep before the painting, they had all of them, at least their white handkerchiefs ready for that demonstration of sensibility&quot;.

=== Late career and retirement: Physical decline ===

As noted in Campbell&#x27;s biography, Siddons returned to the role some six years later, and in 1802 she left Drury Lane for its rival establishment, Covent Garden. It was there, on 29 June 1812, after 57 performances that season, that she gave what was credited as perhaps the most extraordinary farewell performance in theatre history. The audience refused to allow &quot;Macbeth&quot; to continue after the end of the sleepwalking scene. Eventually, after tumultuous applause from the pit, the curtain reopened and Siddons was discovered sitting in her own clothes and character – whereupon she made an emotional farewell speech to the audience. Some records stated that her farewell lasted eight minutes, others suggested ten, all indicating that she was visibly distraught.

Siddons formally retired from the stage in 1812, but reappeared on special occasions. An 1816 request by Princess Charlotte of Wales to see Lady Macbeth brought Siddons out of retirement. Much older, Siddons was visibly weak, overweight, and was considered by some a &quot;grotesque effigy of her former self.&quot; William Hazlitt, in his later accounts, stated that her performances lacked the grandeur they had shown in 1785: the &quot;machinery of her voice is slow, there is too long a pause between each sentence [and the] sleeping scene was more laboured and less natural&quot;. As a result, according to Lisa Freeman, Siddons&#x27; &quot;iconic status came into conflict with the aesthetic of authenticity that she cultivated&quot;. Her last appearance was on 9 June 1819 as Lady Randolph in John Home&#x27;s play &quot;Douglas&quot;.

=== Marriage and children ===
In 1773, at the age of 18, she married William Siddons, an actor. After 30 years, the marriage became strained and informally ended with their separation in 1804. William died in 1808.

Sarah Siddons gave birth to seven children, five of whom she outlived:
* Henry Siddons (1774–1815), an actor and theatre manager in Edinburgh
* Sarah Martha (Sally) Siddons (1775–1803)
* Maria Siddons (1779–1798)
* Frances Emilia Siddons (b. 1781), died in infancy
* Elizabeth Ann Siddons (1782–1788), died in childhood
* George John Siddons (1785–1848), a Customs official in India
* Cecilia Siddons (1794–1868), who married George Combe in 1833 and lived in Edinburgh

Siddons regularly performed on stage while visibly pregnant, which often elicited sympathy for her character. As Lady Macbeth, her pregnancy not only provided &quot;a further reminder of the domestic life of both the actress and the character&quot;, adding a maternal aspect to her portrayal, but also created &quot;a new level of tension in the play not present if the couple is perceived as barren.&quot;

Her descendants include John Siddons Corby, who invented the Corby gentleman&#x27;s trouser press, and his children, Peter Corby (inventor of the modern trouser press) and Jane Beadon (socialite and actress).

== Legacy ==
=== Death and burial ===
Sarah Siddons died in 1831 in London. She was interred in Saint Mary&#x27;s Cemetery at Paddington Green. The churchyard was converted into a public park (St Mary&#x27;s Gardens) in 1881, and most stones were cleared at that time. Siddons&#x27; gravestone was one of the few to be preserved, and it remains in good condition beneath a wrought iron canopy, despite some erosion and the modern addition of a protective cage.

Five thousand people attended her funeral. Newspapers mourned her death, publishing long obituaries. One wrote: &quot;This lady, who, at no very distant period, was not less eminent for the splendour of her mental endowments, than for the towering majesty of her person and demeanour, paid the great debt of nature on Wednesday morning, at nine o&#x27;clock.&quot; She was described as a goddess, a royal, majestic. The extent of her celebrity reaches forward to today.

=== In popular culture ===
Siddons&#x27;s portrayal of the prostitute Millwood in a 1796 production of &quot;The London Merchant&quot; inspired the novel &quot;George Barnwell&quot; by Thomas Skinner Surr.

American director Joseph L. Mankiewicz used the 1784 portrait by Reynolds extensively in his film &quot;All About Eve&quot;, winner of the 1950 Academy Award for Best Picture. The portrait is seen at the top of an entrance staircase in Margo Channing&#x27;s apartment, appearing throughout a party scene, and emphasized by a close-up with which the scene ends. Mankiewicz also invented the (then) fictitious Sarah Siddons Society for the film, along with its award, a statuette modelled upon the Reynolds painting. The film opens with a close-up of the statuette, and ends with a character holding it.

Actress Bette Davis, who played Margo Channing in the film, posed as Siddons in a 1957 re-creation of the Reynolds portrait staged as part of the Pageant of the Masters.

In April 2010, BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour Drama&quot; presented &quot;Sarah Siddons: Life in Five Sittings&quot;, a radio drama by David Pownall about the long relationship between Siddons and artist Thomas Lawrence, in five 15-minute parts, whilst she is the central character in &quot;The Divine Mrs S.&quot;, a 2024 play by April De Angelis.

=== Sarah Siddons Award ===

When the film &quot;All About Eve&quot; was released in 1950, the &quot;Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement&quot; depicted in its opening scene was a purely fictitious award. However, in 1952, a small group of distinguished Chicago theatergoers formed the Sarah Siddons Society, and began to give a genuine award by that name. The now-prestigious Sarah Siddons Award is presented annually in Chicago, with a trophy modelled on the statuette of Siddons awarded in the film. Past honorees include Bette Davis and Celeste Holm, who were previously the cast of &quot;All About Eve&quot;.

=== Portraits and statues ===
Siddons sat for numerous artists, and her portraits include many that depict her in costume portraying a theatrical role.

* Sir Thomas Lawrence first painted Siddons at Bath in 1782, and produced at least fourteen portraits of her over the next 22 years. The last of these, an 1804 full-length portrait, is on display at Tate Britain.
* Sir Joshua Reynolds painted his famous portrait, &quot;Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse&quot;, in 1784. He told her that he had signed it on the hem of her dress because he had &quot;resolved to go down to posterity on the hem of your garment.&quot; It now hangs at The Huntington in San Marino, California.
* A 1785 portrait by Thomas Gainsborough is displayed in London&#x27;s National Gallery.
* A portrait of Siddons is displayed in the church hall of St Mary on Paddington Green, near Siddons&#x27; grave in the former churchyard (now St Mary&#x27;s Gardens).
* Also on Paddington Green, the &quot;Statue of Sarah Siddons&quot; overlooks the Harrow Road. Designed by Léon-Joseph Chavalliaud, it was unveiled in 1897 by Henry Irving
* A statue of Siddons by sculptor Thomas Campbell stands in the chapel of St Andrew in Westminster Abbey. The statue holds a scroll, and the inscription reads: &quot;Sarah Siddons. Born at Brecon July 5, 1755. Died in London June 8, 1831.&quot;
* A bust by James Smith, created in 1813 was placed in the Green Room at Drury Lane Theatre and contemporary adverts described it as the only bust &quot;taken from life&quot;

* Siddons Tower, a folly tower erected on the water&#x27;s edge at Rostellan near Cork Harbour in Ireland, was named in Siddons&#x27; honour by Murrough O&#x27;Brien, Lord Inchiquin, after he had entertained the actress at Rostellan House.
* Siddons Lane, a small street in Marylebone near the site of a house in which she once lived, was named after her.
* Siddons&#x27; birthplace, an inn in Brecon, Wales, is now known as The Sarah Siddons Inn. In 1755, when Siddons was born in lodgings on an upper floor, it was a tavern called The Shoulder of Mutton.
* Sarah Siddons&#x27; House (the Old House) in Lower Lydbrook, Gloucestershire is reputedly her childhood home.
* In 1923, London&#x27;s Metropolitan Railway brought into service an electric locomotive named &quot;Sarah Siddons&quot;, No. 12. The locomotive remained in service along with others like it on the London Underground Metropolitan line until 1961. Painted a maroon colour, she is now the only one of the original twenty locomotives to remain preserved in working order.
* In 1961, the Sarah Siddons Comprehensive School (later the Sarah Siddons Girls&#x27; School) opened in North Wharf Road, Paddington. It was officially opened the following year by the actress Dame Peggy Ashcroft. Women&#x27;s achievement was celebrated in the girls-only secondary school, with houses named after famous English women. In 1980, it became part of the North Westminster Community School, then in 2006 it was closed before the site was sold for residential development. In 2019, a &#x27;Remembering Sarah Siddons Comprehensive School&#x27; Facebook group had more than 540 members.

<doc id="221971" wikidata="Q377977" url="?curid=221971" title="Thorvald Stoltenberg">
<text>Thorvald Stoltenberg (8 July 1931 – 13 July 2018) was a Norwegian politician and diplomat. He served as Minister of Defence from 1979 to 1981 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1987 to 1989 and again from 1990 to 1993 in two Labour governments. 

From 1989 to 1990, Stoltenberg served as the Norwegian ambassador to the United Nations. In 1990, he became the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, serving for one year after which he rejoined the Norwegian government. In 1992, Stoltenberg, together with nine Baltic ministers of foreign affairs and an EU commissioner, founded the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the EuroFaculty. In 1993, he was appointed Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for the former Yugoslavia and U.N. Co-Chairman of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia. Thorvald Stoltenberg was also the UN witness at the signing of Erdut Agreement. 

In 2003 he was appointed chairman of the board of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA). Between 1999 and 2008, he was President of the Norwegian Red Cross, the only president to serve three terms. He was also a member of the Trilateral Commission, and held a seat on their executive committee.

At the local level, Stoltenberg was elected to the Oslo City Council in 2015.

==Youth==
Stoltenberg was born in Oslo, the son of Ingeborg (b. Andresen, 1905-1993) and Theodor Emil Stoltenberg (1900-1998). In his mid-20s, Stoltenberg became heavily involved in the organization of Hungarian refugees fleeing the invading Soviet Army in 1956. While evacuating refugees by boat in the middle of the night, he jumped into the strong currents, risking his own life to save one of the boats. One of the other rescuers, American journalist Barry Farber described witnessing the incident in December 2006 on the Norwegian talk-show &quot;Først &amp; sist&quot;.

==Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG)==
&quot;[In] May 1993, the UN&#x27;s co-chair at the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia, Th. Stoltenberg was appointed Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG). As such, he acted as head of the UN mission in the former Yugoslavia and served as the first point of contact for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York. All contacts between UNPROFOR in Zagreb and the UN in New York had to run via his office (...) Mr Stoltenberg was responsible for the coordination of all UNPROFOR operations, which also entailed assessments of the political implications of operational decisions as well as the actions of the conflicting parties. In practice, this combination of tasks was impossible to juggle. A serious conflict is said to have occurred between Thorvald Stoltenberg and General Wahlgren&#x27;s successor, General J. Cot of France&quot;.

Cot disagreed with Stoltenberg about the latter&#x27;s role as SRSG, and at the end of 1993 the two tasks were again split up. Stoltenberg stayed on as co-chair of the peace negotiations in Geneva on behalf of the UN, and on 1 January 1994 the Japanese diplomat Y. Akashi was appointed SRSG responsible for all UNPROFOR operations in the former Yugoslavia. It was he who negotiated with the authorities of the conflicting parties.

==Political views==
===Lobbying for changes in drug policy===
In 2010, Stoltenberg led a commission whose primary purpose was to recommend changes in Norwegian drug policy to improve the situation of hard drug addicts. The question of heroin prescription was one of the most controversial topics evaluated by the commission set up by Bjarne Håkon Hanssen. The commission concluded in June 2010 that Norway should start trials with heroin prescription, in addition to making several other changes to its drug policy. He also joined an international campaign for a less punitive drug policy, the Global Commission on Drug Policy, consisting of, among others, former Latin American leaders.

===Sanctions against Israel===
In 2010, together with 25 other statesmen, Stoltenberg sent a letter to EU leaders and the heads of government of the EU countries, demanding sanctions against Israel for its violations of international law. His co-signatories included Javier Solana, Felipe González, Romano Prodi, Lionel Jospin and Mary Robinson.

==Private life==
He married Karin Heiberg (1931–2012) in 1955. Their son, Jens Stoltenberg (born 1959), followed him into politics and served as Prime Minister of Norway from 2000 to 2001 and from 2005 to 2013, and as NATO Secretary-General from 2014 to 2024. They also had two daughters, Camilla (born 1958), a medical researcher and administrator, and Nini (1963–2014) whose heroin addiction has been much publicized. 

Thorvald Stoltenberg died on 13 July 2018 at the age of 87 after a short illness.

<doc id="221983" wikidata="Q6146651" url="?curid=221983" title="USS Topeka (CL-67)">
<text>USS &quot;Topeka&quot; (CL-67), a light cruiser in service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1949. From 1957 to 1960, she was converted to a guided missile cruiser and redesignated CLG-8. The cruiser served again from 1960 to 1969 and was finally scrapped in 1975.

==Construction and commissioning==
She was laid down on 21 April 1943 by the Bethlehem Steel Company yard located at Quincy, Massachusetts, launched on 19 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Frank J. Warren, and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 23 December 1944, Captain Thomas L. Wattles in command.

==Service history==
===1940s===
After shakedown in the West Indies and post-shakedown repairs, &quot;Topeka&quot; departed Boston on 10 April 1945 for duty with the Pacific Fleet. The following day she joined , and steamed via Culebra Island and Guantánamo Bay to the Panama Canal. They transited the canal on 19 April and reported for duty on the 20th. The next day, &quot;Topeka&quot; and her steaming mate headed for Pearl Harbor, where they arrived on 2 May. Following almost three weeks of gunnery exercises in the Hawaiian Islands, the cruiser sailed west from Pearl Harbor as the flagship of Cruiser Division 18. She entered Ulithi in the Western Carolines on 1 June and, after three days in the anchorage, put to sea with , &quot;Oklahoma City&quot;, , and to rendezvous with Task Force 38.

On her first cruise with the fast carriers, she screened them against enemy air attack while their planes made three raids against targets in the enemy&#x27;s home islands and the Ryukyu Islands. On 8 June, TF 38 aircraft hit Kanoya on Kyūshū, the home of Japanese naval aviation. The next day, they struck Okino Daito in the Ryukyus, located a little over 200 miles west of Okinawa. The third and final strike of her first combat cruise came on 10 June and provided the cruiser with her initial opportunity to join the fray. While TG 38.1 aircraft bombed and strafed the airfield on Minami Daito, the ships in the screen, &quot;Topeka&quot; among them, moved in and took the other installations under fire. At the conclusion of that action, &quot;Topeka&quot; moved off with the rest of TG 38.1 bound for San Pedro Bay, Leyte.

After spending the latter half of June at Leyte for relaxation and replenishment, the light cruiser returned to sea on 1 July with TF 38 for the final six-week carrier sweep of the Japanese home islands. The task force made a fueling rendezvous on the 8th and then began a run-in toward Tokyo which the American planes bombed on 10 July. Next, the ships moved north to Honshū and Hokkaidō for a two-day antishipping sweep of the area around Hakodate and Muroran. They retired from the area for another fueling rendezvous on the 16th, but returned to the vicinity of southern Honshū and resumed the aerial blitz of Tokyo on the 17th–18th. On the night of the latter date, &quot;Topeka&quot; had another opportunity to strike the enemy directly when she joined , , &quot;Oklahoma City&quot;, and the destroyers of DesRon 62 in an antishipping sweep of the entrance to Sagami Nada near the sea approaches to Tokyo. During that sweep, she fired her guns at Japanese installations located on Nojima Zaki, the point of land which marks the eastern terminus of the entrance into Sagami Nada. Completing another replenishment retirement from 19 to 23 July, the task force resumed its air raids on central Japan with two extensive forays against shipping in the Inland Sea on the 24th and 28th, respectively.

A typhoon at the end of July forced the task force to take evasive action and postpone further air operations until the second week in August. At that time, &quot;Topeka&quot; steamed north with TF 38 while the carriers moved into position to send sortie after sortie against heavy concentrations of enemy aircraft on northern Honshū. Those raids, launched on 9–10 August, proved eminently successful, wiping out what was later learned to be the transportation for 2,000 shock troops being assembled for a one-way, suicide mission to destroy the B-29 Superfortress bases on Tinian. The carrier planes paid return visits to Tokyo on the 12th–13th and were taking off to repeat those attacks when a message arrived on the 15th, telling of Japan&#x27;s capitulation.

&quot;Topeka&quot; patrolled Japanese waters until mid-September, at which time she entered Tokyo Bay. She remained there until 1 October, the day she began her homeward voyage to the United States. The cruiser stopped briefly at Okinawa on the 4th to embark 529 veterans and resumed her eastern progress on the 5th. On 19 October, she arrived in Portland, Oregon, and disembarked her passengers. Ten days later, she steamed south to San Pedro, Los Angeles, for overhaul. On 3 January 1946, the warship put to sea to return to the Far East. She reached Yokosuka on the 24th and began duty supporting American occupation forces in Japan, China, and in the Central Pacific islands. During that tour of duty, which lasted until the following fall, she called at Sasebo, Japan, Tsingtao and Shanghai in China; Manila in the Philippines; and Guam in the Mariana Islands. The cruiser returned to San Pedro on 20 November.

Following an overhaul and operations along the west coast, she headed back to the Orient on 22 September 1947. Upon her arrival at Yokosuka, Japan, on 10 October, she became a unit of TF 71. Operating from bases at Shanghai and Tsingtao. the warship patrolled the north China coast while civil war raged on shore between Nationalist and communist factions. She concluded that duty early in March and entered Nagasaki, Japan, on the 8th. Following visits to Sasebo and Kure, &quot;Topeka&quot; sailed for the United States on 25 April and arrived in Long Beach, California, on 7 May. Later that month, she moved to Pearl Harbor for a four-month overhaul at the completion of which she returned to the west coast. Late in October, the warship resumed local operations out of Long Beach and out of San Diego. She remained so occupied until February 1949. On 25 February, she arrived in San Francisco to prepare for inactivation. &quot;Topeka&quot; was decommissioned there on 18 June 1949, and berthed with the local group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===1950s===
Early in 1957, &quot;Topeka&quot; was towed from San Francisco to the New York Naval Shipyard, which she entered on 15 April to begin conversion to a guided missile light cruiser. On 23 May, she was officially redesignated CLG-8. During the almost three years it took to convert her, the cruiser was extensively modified. She retained only half her original gun battery, losing her two after 6 inch triple turrets and her three after 5 inch double mounts. The removal of these guns made room for the installation of her twin Terrier surface-to-air missile launcher and related ancillary equipment.

===1960s===

On 26 March 1960, &quot;Topeka&quot; was recommissioned, Captain Frank L. Pinny, Jr., in command. In July, she made the passage from New York to the west coast. From August to October, the refurbished cruiser conducted shakedown training in the southern California operating area and then reported for duty at her home port, Long Beach. During the ensuing three years, &quot;Topeka&quot; alternated two peacetime deployments to the western Pacific with repair periods and local operations on the west coast. Her two tours in the Orient were characterized by visits to such places as Hong Kong, the Philippines, Okinawa, and a number of ports in Japan as well as exercises with other ships of the 7th Fleet and of Allied navies. When not deployed to the Far East, she conducted training operations, upkeep, and repairs.

In March 1964, she embarked upon her third deployment to the western Pacific since being recommissioned. That deployment began routinely enough with fleet exercises in May and calls at Japanese, Taiwanese, Malaysian, and Philippine ports. However, in August, North Vietnamese torpedo-boats attacked on the 2nd and then returned to attack &quot;Maddox&quot; and . This action, known as the Gulf of Tonkin incident, gave the remaining part of &quot;Topeka&quot;″s deployment a more wartime character. &quot;Topeka&quot; cruised the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin while American involvement in the Vietnam War began to gather momentum. It was more than a year, though, before she steamed into war in earnest. Late in October, she started for home and reentered Long Beach near the end of the second week of November. For the next 12 months, she viewed the developing war from afar-operating out of west coast ports, undergoing repairs and modifications, and conducting exercises with the 1st Fleet.

On 29 November 1965, however, she headed back to the western Pacific for the first deployment during which her primary mission was to support the American and South Vietnamese forces fighting the communists. On that tour of duty, she served as the flagship for the Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group, 7th Fleet. In that capacity the ship operated in the South China Sea and in the Gulf of Tonkin providing naval gunfire support for the troops ashore and supporting carrier air operations by conducting search and rescue missions for downed aircrews. She punctuated tours of duty in the combat zone with port visits to Yokosuka, Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippine ports of Manila, Davao City, and Subic Bay. Her six-month deployment ended on 28 May 1966, when &quot;Topeka&quot; reentered Long Beach.

Five months of normal west coast operations followed. On 31 October, the guided missile cruiser entered the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco for an overhaul during which her weapons systems were updated, and her engineering plant was overhauled. On 13 March 1967, she completed the yard overhaul and began sea trials and, later refresher training. She finished those evolutions early in June and resumed local operations. On 1 August, the warship put to sea from Long Beach for her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. She stopped at Norfolk, Virginia, on 12–13 August to embark the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 12, and his staff and then sailed for Palma de Majorca on the 14th. On the 20th, &quot;Topeka&quot; joined the 6th Fleet and, on the 22nd, relieved as flagship for TG 60.2. During her five months with the 6th Fleet, she ranged the length of the &quot;middle sea.&quot; In late September and early October, the warship participated in NATO exercise Eager Beaver, conducted in the eastern end of the Mediterranean. In mid-October, she conducted operations in the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas on her way back to the western end.
In January 1968, she concluded her first tour of duty in the Mediterranean with another NATO exercise, this one an amphibious operation. On the 12th, she was relieved by at Rota, Spain. The cruiser then headed back to the United States. After stops at Puerto Rico and in the Panama Canal Zone, &quot;Topeka&quot; reentered Long Beach on 29 January.

On 2 February, the warship began a five-week availability at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. The guided missile cruiser departed Long Beach again on 15 March, bound for her new home port, Mayport, Florida. After arriving at her destination on 21 March, &quot;Topeka&quot; remained in port for upkeep until 6 May, when she returned to sea for refresher training at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Returning to Mayport on the 26th, the ship began preparations for another deployment to the Mediterranean, the last deployment of her career.

&quot;Topeka&quot; departed Mayport on 29 June and, after gunnery exercises at Culebra Island near Puerto Rico, she headed across the Atlantic. On 9 July, she relieved &quot;Columbus&quot; at Málaga, Spain, and began 6th Fleet operations. The warship&#x27;s final deployment proved to be routine in nature. She visited ports all along the Mediterranean littoral and conducted operations in all portions of the middle sea from the Aegean and Ionian Seas in the east to the French Riviera ports in the west. Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and France, as well as the islands of Malta, Crete, and Majorca, provided her with interesting ports of call. &quot;Topeka&quot; concluded her assignment with the 6th Fleet on 9 December at Rota when she was relieved once again by &quot;Columbus&quot;. That same day, she headed for Mayport, arriving 10 days later.

On 30 January 1969, &quot;Topeka&quot; steamed out of Mayport and proceeded north for inactivation. After a stop at Yorktown, Virginia, to off-load her ordnance, she arrived in Boston on 5 February. There, she completed inactivation preparations; and, on 5 June, &quot;Topeka&quot; was placed out of commission. The warship was towed to Philadelphia and was berthed with the reserve fleet group there.

On 1 December 1973, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and on 20 March 1975 she was sold to the Southern Scrap Material Company, Ltd., for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;Topeka&quot; was awarded two battle stars for her World War II service and three battle stars for her Vietnam service.

<doc id="221985" wikidata="Q1422563" url="?curid=221985" title="Stewart Home">
<text>Kevin Llewellyn Callan (born 24 March 1962), better known as Stewart Home, is an English artist, filmmaker, writer, pamphleteer, art historian, and activist. His novels include the non-narrative &quot;69 Things to Do with a Dead Princess&quot; (2002), and the re-imagining of the 1960s in &quot;Tainted Love&quot; (2005). Earlier parodistic pulp fictions work includes &quot;Pure Mania&quot;, &quot;Red London&quot;, &quot;No Pity&quot;, &quot;Cunt&quot;, and &quot;Defiant Pose&quot; which pastiche the work of 1970s British skinhead pulp novel writer Richard Allen and combine it with pornography, political agit-prop, and historical references to punk rock and avant-garde art.

==Life and work==
Home was born in Wimbledon, (then in Surrey) South London. His mother, Julia Callan-Thompson, was a model who was associated with the radical arts scene in Notting Hill Gate.

In the 1980s and 1990s, he exhibited art and also wrote a number of non-fiction pamphlets, magazines, and books, and edited anthologies. They chiefly reflected the politics of the radical left, punk culture, the occult, the history and influence of the Situationists – of whom he is a severe critic – and other radical left-wing 20th century anti-art avant-garde movements. In Home&#x27;s earlier work, the focus of these reflections was often Neoism, a subcultural network of which he had been a member, and from which he derived various splinter projects. Typical characteristics of his activism in the 1980s and 1990s included use of group identities (such as Monty Cantsin) and collective monikers (e.g. &quot;Karen Eliot&quot;); overt employment of plagiarism; pranks and publicity stunts.

===1970s===

As a youth Home was drawn first to music and bohemianism, and then to radicalism. He attended meetings of many different leftist groups including several organised by the Trotskyist Socialist Youth League and even two editorial meetings of &quot;Anarchy Magazine&quot;. He did not join these organisations and later repudiated them as reactionary, instead professing autonomous communist political positions after going to the London Workers Group. In the late seventies Home produced his first punk (music) fanzines, including early issues of &quot;Down in the Street&quot; which had run to seven numbers by the time he stopped publishing it in 1980. At the end of the seventies Home also made his first public appearances as a musician as bassist with revolutionary ska band The Molotovs.

===1980s===

From 1982 to 1984, Home operated as a one-person-movement &quot;Generation Positive&quot;, and having already founded a punk band called White Colours (named after an experimental novel by R. D. Reeve) in 1980, he started a new group with the same name in 1982. He also published an art fanzine &quot;SMILE&quot;, the name of which was a play on the Mail Art zines &quot;FILE&quot; and &quot;VILE&quot; (which in turn parodied the graphic design of LIFE magazine). The concept was that many other bands in the world should call themselves &quot;White Colours&quot;, and many other underground periodicals should call themselves &quot;SMILE&quot;, too. Home&#x27;s early &quot;SMILE&quot; magazines mostly contained art manifestos for the &quot;Generation Positive&quot;, which in their rhetoric resembled those of 1920s Berlin Dadaist manifestos.

In April 1984, Home got in touch with the originally American subcultural artistic network of Neoism, and participated in the eighth Neoist Apartment Festival in London. Since Neoism operated with multiple identities, too, and called upon all its participants to adopt the name Monty Cantsin, Home decided to give up the &quot;Generation Positive&quot; in favor of Neoism, and make &quot;SMILE&quot; and White Colours part of Neoism as well. According to Florian Cramer (who didn&#x27;t come into contact with Neoism until the late eighties) one year later, Home took a sleep-deprivation prank played with him at a Neoist Festival in Italy as the reason to declare his split from Neoism; Home insists he decided to break with Neoism before going to Italy. Shortly before, a conflict between him and Neoism founder Istvan Kantor had escalated and led to their alienation.

Home&#x27;s &quot;SMILE&quot; no 8, which appeared in 1985, reflected the split with Neoism by proposing a &quot;Praxis&quot; movement to replace Neoism, with Karen Eliot as its new multiple name. This and the following three &quot;SMILE&quot; issues otherwise featured an eclectic mixture of manifesto-style writing, political reflections on radical left-wing anti-art movements from the Lettrist International, the Situationists, Fluxus, Mail Art, individuals such as Gustav Metzger and Henry Flynt, and short parodistic skinhead pulp prose in the style of his then unwritten early novels.
Many texts included in Home&#x27;s &quot;SMILE&quot; issues plagiarised other, especially Situationist, writing, simply replacing terms like &quot;spectacle&quot; with &quot;glamour&quot;.

At the same time Home was involved in a series of collective installations including &quot;Ruins of Glamour&quot; (Chisenhale Studios, London 1986), &quot;Desire in Ruins&quot; (Transmission Gallery, Glasgow 1987), &quot;Refuse&quot; (Galleriet Läderfabriken, Malmö 1988) and &quot;Anon&quot; (33 Arts Centre, Luton 1989) which generated serious art world interest and art publication reviews and even coverage in British newspapers such as &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot;. Those Home worked closely with on these shows included Hannah Vowles and Glyn Banks (collectively known as Art in Ruins), Ed Baxter and Stefan Szczelkun.

Following on from this and drawing on 1980s American appropriation art, Home&#x27;s concept of plagiarism soon developed into a proposed movement and a series of &quot;Festivals of Plagiarism&quot; in 1988 and 1989, which themselves plagiarised the Neoist apartment festivals and 1960s Fluxus festivals. Home combined the plagiarism campaign with a call for an Art Strike between 1990 and 1993. Unlike earlier art-strike proposals such as that of Gustav Metzger in the 1970s, it was not intended as an opportunity for artists to seize control of the means of distributing their own work, but rather as an exercise in propaganda and psychic warfare aimed at smashing the entire art world rather than just the gallery system.

The Art Strike campaign caused something of a rumpus in the contemporary London art world (Home got to talk about the Art Strike at venues such as the Institute of Contemporary Art and Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as on national BBC Radio arts programmes and London area television arts programmes), but was more seriously discussed in subcultural art networks, especially in Mail Art. Consequently, mail artists made up a reasonable proportion of the participants at the Festivals of Plagiarism, and Mail Art publications disseminated the Art Strike campaign.

In the 1980s Home was also a regular contributor to the anarcho-punk/cultural magazine &quot;VAGUE&quot;.

===1990s===

In 1993 Home officially resurfaced, having meanwhile gained an influence and reputation in American counter-culture comparable to writers like Hakim Bey and Kathy Acker. Aside from reassessments of his earlier engagement with Neoism, the Situationists, punk, and the plagiarism and Art Strike campaigns, and, as his source of income, the continued pulp-novel writing.

In the post-Art Strike years, he had for the first time publicly occupied himself with hermeticism and the occult. The Neoist Alliance, his third one-person-movement after The Generation Positive and Praxis, served simultaneously as a tactical reappropriation of the Neoism label for self-promotional purposes, and as a corporate identity for pamphlets that satirically advocated a combination of artistic avant-garde, the occult, and politics into an &quot;avant-bard&quot;.

Higgs included Home in group shows he curated – such as &quot;Imprint 93&quot; at City Racing (London June–July 95), &quot;Multiple Choice&quot; at Cubitt Gallery (London March–April 96) and &quot;A to Z&quot; at Approach Gallery (London 1998) – as well issuing a pamphlet and later a badge by Home as part of his prestigious edition of Imprint 93 multiples. At this time uber curator Hans Ulrich Obrist also included Home in his survey of young British art &quot;Life/Live&quot; Musée d’art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (October 96- January 97, subsequently toured). In the mid-nineties Home was also appearing regularly as a live artist at &quot;Disobey&quot; events organised by Paul Smith and featuring music from the likes of techno acts Panasonic and Aphex Twin.

===2000s===

Aware of the marked decline in countercultural activities throughout the urban centres in which he operated, Home shifted gear in this area of his work in the new millennium, upping his level of Internet activities; web work had been only a minor part of his repertoire in the 1990s.

Home&#x27;s novels in this period no longer incorporated subcultural elements and instead focused on issues of form and aesthetics: &quot;69 Things to Do with a Dead Princess&quot; contains capsule reviews of dozens of obscure books as well as elaborate descriptions of stone circles, while in &quot;Down and Out in Shoreditch &amp; Hoxton&quot; every paragraph is exactly 100 words long. At times in this period Home&#x27;s film making also became radically non-representational, and rarely required any original cinematography whatsoever; for example his 2002 fiftieth anniversary English language colour re-make of Guy Debord&#x27;s &quot;Screams in Favour of De Sade&quot;, and 2004 &quot;Eclipse &amp; Re-Emergence of the Oedipus Complex&quot;, the latter consists solely of still photographs of his mother with a narration scripted by Home but delivered by Australian actress Alice Parkinson.

This tendency towards abstraction was already evident in some of Home&#x27;s work of the 1990s, particularly sound pieces such as the cut up radio play &quot;Divvy&quot;, but in the 2000s it became increasingly central to his output.

Art School Orgy

Despite having a lengthy publishing record with established publishers, Home still had difficulties, in recent years, finding publishers for his work, notably &quot;Art School Orgy&quot;, on account of the central character sharing the name with living artist David Hockney. The book depicts Hockney participating in scenes of extreme BDSM. During 2021, Home promoted the book via social media, predominantly via Facebook, and a series of YouTube videos featuring Home with an inflatable doll named David Hockney. The book was eventually published in January 2023 by Loughborough-based online record label, New Reality Records, and sold via their Bandcamp page.

==Neoist Alliance==
The Neoist Alliance was a moniker used by Home between 1994 and 1999 for his mock-occult psychogeographical activities. According to Home, the alliance was an occult order with himself as the magus and only member. The manifesto called for &quot;debasement in the arts&quot; and in a parodic manner plagiarized a 1930s British fascist pamphlet on cultural politics. Alliance activities mainly consisted of the publication of a newsletter &quot;Re-action&quot; which appeared in ten issues.

In 1993, the Neoist Alliance staged a prank against a concert by composer Karlheinz Stockhausen in Brighton by announcing its intention to levitate the concert hall by magical means during the concert. This was an homage to the 1965 anti-art picketing of a Stockhausen concert in New York by Fluxus members Henry Flynt and George Maciunas.

Alliance activities ran parallel and were closely related to those of the revived London Psychogeographical Association and the Italian-based Luther Blissett project.

Despite its name, the Neoist Alliance had no affiliation with the international Neoist network which had been active since 1980. Stewart Home had previously become a member and activist of that network in 1984, but renounced it one year later and subsequently worked under the collective monikers of &quot;Praxis&quot;, later &quot;plagiarism&quot; and the Art Strike movement.

Despite its highly personal perspective and agenda, &quot;The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War&quot; (Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London, 1988) is considered a useful art-history work, providing an introduction to a range of cultural currents which had, at that time at least, been under-documented. The work has, however, been highly criticised for deficiencies in its view of utopian currents, including its personal biases, by such writers as Bob Black.

&quot;Pure Mania&quot;, Home&#x27;s first novel from 1989, took the recipe of the Richard Allen parodies from &quot;SMILE&quot; and turned them into a recipe for much of his subsequent novel writing of the 1990s (there are exceptions such as the non-linear &quot;Come Before Christ &amp; Murder Love&quot;). The book &quot;Neoist Manifestos/The Art Strike Papers&quot; featured, on its first part, abridged versions of Home&#x27;s manifesto-style writings from &quot;SMILE&quot;, and a compilation of writings and reactions regarding the Art Strike from various authors and sources, mainly Mail Art publications.

His 1995 novel &quot;Slow Death&quot; fictionalises and ridicules this process of the historification of Neoism (including the planting of archives at the National Art Library in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Home&#x27;s novel &quot;Cunt&quot; was rejected by several publishers before being published by Do-Not Press in 1999. Its plot, which satirises travel writing, the picaresque novel and the publishing industry, centres on David Kelso, an author attempting to write a trilogy recounting his sexual experiences. &quot;Confusion Incorporated: A Collection of Lies, Hoaxes and Hidden Truths&quot;, published in the same year, is a collection of fictional interviews, reviews and essays. A third 1999 publication, the pamphlet &quot;Repetitions: A Collection of Proletarian Pleasures Ranging from Rodent Worship to Ethical Relativism Appended with a Critique of Unicursal Reason&quot;, consists of letters, prefaces and introductions.

===Repression in Russia===

Alex Kervey of T-ough Press, publishers of the Russian edition of &quot;Come Before Christ and Murder Love&quot; has reported repression of the book as &quot;pornography and insulting Christian values&quot;. Kervey says this is happening in the context of a campaign run by such far-right groups as the National Bolsheviks against Home, which has included arson attacks against T-ough Press alongside state censorship.

<doc id="221987" wikidata="Q926534" url="?curid=221987" title="Evil Empire (album)">
<text>Evil Empire is the second studio album by the American rock band Rage Against the Machine, released on April 16, 1996, by Epic Records. It debuted at number 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with first week sales of 249,000 copies, and the song &quot;Tire Me&quot; won a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance; &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; and &quot;People of the Sun&quot; were nominated for Grammys for Best Hard Rock Performance. On May 24, 2000, the album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

The album&#x27;s title is a reference to a term used in the early 1980s by President Ronald Reagan and many American conservatives to describe the Soviet Union.

==Background==
According to MTV News, &quot;The title &#x27;Evil Empire&#x27; is taken from what Rage Against The Machine see as Ronald Reagan&#x27;s slander of the Soviet Union in the eighties, which the band feels could just as easily apply to the United States.&quot;

Before the May 27, 1996, performance of &quot;Without a Face&quot; that is featured on the band&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Live &amp; Rare&quot; album, Zack de la Rocha said: &quot;It seems as if soon as the... the wall in Germany fell, that the US government was busy building another one on the border between the US and Mexico. Since 1986, as a result of a lot of the hate talk and hysteria that the government of the United States has been speaking, 1,500 bodies have been found on the border. We wrote this song in response to it.&quot;

&quot;Year of tha Boomerang&quot; had previously been included in the film &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, though its title was written as &quot;Year of the Boomerang&quot; on the packaging of the film&#x27;s soundtrack, as well as that of the song&#x27;s promotional single.

==Packaging==
The cover of the album features an altered version of a painting of the 1940s–1950s comic book hero Crimebuster done by Mel Ramos, with the emblem on the boy&#x27;s costume changed from a &quot;c&quot; to a lowercase &quot;e&quot;, the caption &quot;Crime Buster&quot; changed to the album&#x27;s title, and the color of the star in the background changed. The boy on the cover was author and businessman Ari Meisel when he was 11 years old. Meisel told &quot;Kerrang!&quot; that the original painting was a birthday present from Ramos. Additional artwork for the album was created by Barbara Kruger, some of which appears in the video for &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot;.

The album&#x27;s CD booklet includes a picture of a pile of various political and philosophical books, which include:

* &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; by Howard Zinn
* &quot;Capital, Volume I&quot; by Karl Marx 
* &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; by James Joyce

* &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; by Frantz Fanon
* &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; by Arthur Koestler
* &quot;Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media&quot; by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky
* &quot;Live from Death Row&quot; by Mumia Abu-Jamal
* &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; by Dalton Trumbo

* &quot;Another Country&quot; by James Baldwin

==Promotion==
In 1995, the band sent a free 7″ record to everyone who signed up for the fan club promoted in the liner notes of their debut. Doubling as an apology to those who had received nothing and a promotion for the upcoming album, it came in a plain cardboard-colored fold-out with a black-and-white American flag on the cover alongside the band&#x27;s name and &quot;Evil Empire&quot; in capital letters. On the back cover was a UPC with marker scribble on the barcode. The A-side was a reissue of the &quot;Evening Session&quot;-version of &quot;Bombtrack&quot; first broadcast on June 7, 1993 (listed as &quot;Bombtrack (Live on the BBC)&quot;), and the B-side was a then-unreleased cover of N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot; that was recorded live on August 13, 1995, at a benefit concert for Mumia Abu-Jamal at the Capitol Ballroom in Washington, D.C. 

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;This music isn&#x27;t supposed to be fun,&quot; and continued: &quot;Rage Against the Machine have jacked up the sociopolitical siege mentality in their metallic hip – hop to such a dogmatic degree – and honed their sound to such maniacally shrill perfection – that the band and the roaring joys of its harangue &#x27;n&#x27; roll seem virtually sexless.&quot;

The album was said to have cemented Rage Against the Machine as &quot;an important force in the rap-rock style.

<doc id="221998" wikidata="Q411046" url="?curid=221998" title="Thiomersal">
<text>Thiomersal (INN), or thimerosal (USAN, JAN), also sold under the name merthiolate is an organomercury compound. It is a well-established antiseptic and antifungal agent.

The pharmaceutical corporation Eli Lilly and Company named it Merthiolate. It has been used as a preservative in vaccines, immunoglobulin preparations, skin test antigens, antivenins, ophthalmic and nasal products, and tattoo inks. In spite of the scientific consensus that fears about its safety are unsubstantiated, its use as a vaccine preservative has been called into question by anti-vaccination groups. 

A 1999 statement issued in CDC&#x27;s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report announced that &quot;the Public Health Service (PHS), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and vaccine manufacturers agree that thimerosal-containing vaccines should be removed as soon as possible&quot; and that these groups would collaborate to replace them while manufacturers committed &quot;to eliminate or reduce as expeditiously as possible the mercury content of their vaccines.&quot; 

It remains in use as a preservative for certain annual flu vaccines, mostly those stored in multi-dose vials. Single-dose vial flu shots are an option for those who prefer vaccines with no thiomersal, although no scientific data supports claims that there is any link between thiomersal and autism.

==History==
Morris Kharasch, a chemist then at the University of Maryland filed a patent application for thiomersal in 1927; Eli Lilly later marketed the compound under the trade name Merthiolate. In vitro tests conducted by Lilly investigators H. M. Powell and W. A. Jamieson found that it was forty to fifty times as effective as phenol against &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. It was used to kill bacteria and prevent contamination in antiseptic ointments, creams, jellies, and sprays used by consumers and in hospitals, including nasal sprays, eye drops, contact lens solutions, immunoglobulins, and vaccines. Thiomersal was used as a preservative (bactericide) so that multidose vials of vaccines could be used instead of single-dose vials, which are more expensive. By 1938, Lilly&#x27;s assistant director of research listed thiomersal as one of the five most important drugs ever developed by the company.

== Structure ==
Thiomersal features mercury(II) with a coordination number 2, i.e. two ligands are attached to Hg, the thiolate and the ethyl group. The carboxylate group confers solubility in water. Like other two-coordinate Hg(II) compounds, the coordination geometry of Hg is linear, with a 180° S-Hg-C angle. Typically, organomercury thiolate compounds are prepared from organomercury chlorides.

==Uses==
=== Antiseptic/antifungal ===
Thiomersal&#x27;s main use is as an antiseptic and antifungal agent, due to its oligodynamic effect. In multidose injectable drug delivery systems, it prevents serious adverse effects such as the &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; infection that, in one 1928 incident, killed 12 of 21 children vaccinated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Unlike other preservatives at the time, such as phenol and cresol, thiomersal does not reduce the potency of the vaccines that it protects. Bacteriostatics such as thiomersal are not needed in single-dose injectables.

In the United States, the European Union, and a few other affluent countries, thiomersal is no longer used as a preservative in routine childhood vaccination schedules. In the U.S., all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger are available in formulations that do not contain thimerosal. Two vaccines (a TD and the single-dose version of the trivalent influenza vaccine Fluvirin) may contain a trace of thiomersal from steps in manufacture, but less than 1 microgram of mercury per dose. The &quot;multi-dose&quot; versions of some trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines can contain up to 25 micrograms of mercury per dose from thiomersal. Also, four rarely used treatments for pit viper, coral snake, and black widow venom contain thiomersal.

Outside North America and Europe, many vaccines contain thiomersal; the World Health Organization reported no evidence of toxicity from thiomersal in vaccines and no reason on safety grounds to change to more expensive single-dose administration. The United Nations Environment Program backed away from an earlier proposal of putting thiomersal on the list of banned vaccine compounds as part of its campaign to reduce mercury exposure. It stated that eliminating it in multi-dose vaccines, primarily used in developing countries, would lead to high cost and a refrigeration requirement that developing countries could ill afford. At the Minamata Convention on Mercury in 2013 thiomersal was excluded from the treaty.

==Toxicology==
===General toxicity===
Thiomersal is very toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and in contact with skin (EC hazard symbol T+), with a danger of cumulative effects. It is also very toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in aquatic environments (EC hazard symbol N).

In the body, it is metabolized or degraded to ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate.

Cases have been reported of severe mercury poisoning by accidental exposure or attempted suicide, with some fatalities. Animal experiments suggest that thiomersal rapidly dissociates to release ethylmercury after injection; that mercury&#x27;s disposition patterns are similar to those after exposure to equivalent doses of ethylmercury chloride; and that the central nervous system and the kidneys are targets. Loss of motor coordination is a common sign. Similar signs and symptoms have been observed in accidental human poisonings. The mechanisms of toxic action are unknown.

Fecal excretion accounts for most of the elimination from the body. Ethylmercury clears from blood with a half-life of about 18 days in adults by breakdown into other chemicals, including inorganic mercury. The half-life of ethylmercury in the brains of infant monkeys is 14 days. Risk assessment for effects on the nervous system have been made by extrapolating from dose-response relationships for methylmercury. Methylmercury and ethylmercury distribute to all body tissues, crossing the blood–brain barrier and the placental barrier, and ethylmercury also moves freely throughout the body.

Concerns based on extrapolations from methylmercury caused thiomersal to be removed from U.S. childhood vaccines, starting in 1999. Later it was reported that ethylmercury is eliminated from the body and the brain significantly faster than methylmercury, so the late-1990s risk assessments turned out to be overly conservative. Though inorganic mercury metabolized from ethylmercury has a much longer half-life in the brain, at least 120 days, it appears to be much less toxic than the inorganic mercury produced from mercury vapor, for reasons not yet understood.

===As an allergen===
Thiomersal is used in patch testing for people who have dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and other potentially allergic reactions. A 2007 study in Norway found that 1.9% of adults had a positive patch test reaction to thiomersal; a higher prevalence of contact allergy (up to 6.6%) was observed in German populations. Thiomersal-sensitive individuals can receive intramuscular rather than subcutaneous immunization, though there have been no large sample sized studies regarding this matter to date. In real-world practice on vaccination of adult populations, contact allergy does not seem to elicit clinical reaction.

Thiomersal allergy has decreased in Denmark, probably because of its exclusion from vaccines there. In a recent study of Polish children and adolescents with chronic/recurrent eczema, positive reactions to thiomersal were found in 11.7% of children (7–8 y.o.) and 37.6% of adolescents (16–17 y.o.). This difference in the sensitization rates can be explained by changing exposure patterns: The adolescents received six thiomersal-preserved vaccines during their life course, with the last immunization taking place 2–3 years before the study. Younger children received only four thiomersal-preserved vaccines, with the last one applied five years before the study, while further immunizations were performed with thiomersal-free vaccines.

===Removal from vaccines===
The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the FDA initiated a formal risk assessment of thiomersal in vaccines beginning in 1998. After determining the levels of ethylmercury exposure from the currently recommended vaccine schedule, the CBER found these amounts exceeded new standards for methylmercury exposure recently established by the Environmental Protection Agency. On July 7, 1999, both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Public Health Service issued a statement calling for the removal of thiomersal-containing vaccines “as expeditiously as possible.” By March 2001, thiomersal-free versions of all the recommended childhood vaccines for children up to age 6 were available in the United States following the introduction of the new DtAP vaccine.

===Disproven autism hypothesis===

Following the phasing out of thiomersal from most U.S. and European vaccines, some parents saw the action to remove thiomersal—in the setting of a perceived increasing rate of autism as well as increasing number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule—as indicating that the preservative was the cause of autism. The scientific consensus is that no evidence supports these claims, while the rate of autism continued to climb in children who did not take the thiomersal-preserved childhood vaccines. 

Scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization, as well as governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Unconvinced parents attempted to treat their autistic children with unproven and possibly dangerous treatments, and refused to vaccinate them due to fears about thiomersal toxicity. Studying thiomersal potentially diverts resources away from research into more promising areas for autism. Thousands of lawsuits have been filed in U.S. federal court to seek damages from allegedly toxic vaccines, including those purportedly caused by thiomersal.

<doc id="222004" wikidata="Q1149225" url="?curid=222004" title="Euler's four-square identity">
<text>In mathematics, Euler&#x27;s four-square identity says that the product of two numbers, each of which is a sum of four squares, is itself a sum of four squares.

==Algebraic identity==
For any pair of quadruples from a commutative ring, the following expressions are equal:

formula_1

Euler wrote about this identity in a letter dated May 4, 1748 to Goldbach (but he used a different sign convention from the above). It can be verified with elementary algebra. 

The identity was used by Lagrange to prove his four square theorem. More specifically, it implies that it is sufficient to prove the theorem for prime numbers, after which the more general theorem follows. The sign convention used above corresponds to the signs obtained by multiplying two quaternions. Other sign conventions can be obtained by changing any formula_2 to formula_3, and/or any formula_4 to formula_5.

If the formula_2 and formula_4 are real numbers, the identity expresses the fact that the absolute value of the product of two quaternions is equal to the product of their absolute values, in the same way that the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci two-square identity does for complex numbers. This property is the definitive feature of composition algebras.

Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem states that an identity of form,

formula_8

where the formula_9 are bilinear functions of the formula_10 and formula_11 is possible only for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 4, or 8.

===Proof of the identity using quaternions===
Comment: The proof of Euler&#x27;s four-square identity is by simple algebraic evaluation. Quaternions derive from the four-square identity, which can be written as the product of two inner products of 4-dimensional vectors, yielding again an inner product of 4-dimensional vectors: . This defines the quaternion multiplication rule , which simply reflects Euler&#x27;s identity, and some mathematics of quaternions. Quaternions are, so to say, the &quot;square root&quot; of the four-square identity. But let the proof go on: 

Let formula_12 and formula_13 be a pair of quaternions. Their quaternion conjugates are formula_14 and formula_15. Then

formula_16

and

formula_17

The product of these two is formula_18, where formula_19 is a real number, so it can commute with the quaternion formula_20, yielding

formula_21

No parentheses are necessary above, because quaternions associate. The conjugate of a product is equal to the commuted product of the conjugates of the product&#x27;s factors, so

==Pfister&#x27;s identity==
Pfister found another square identity for any even power: 

If the formula_9 are just rational functions of one set of variables, so that each formula_9 has a denominator, then it is possible for all formula_36.

Thus, another four-square identity is as follows:
formula_37

where formula_38 and formula_39 are given by 
formula_40

Incidentally, the following identity is also true: 

formula_41

<text>Letino (Campanian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; and small village in the province of Caserta, in Campania, southern Italy.

It was one of the villages liberated by the Italian Libertarian Communist Insurrection of 1877 by Errico Malatesta, Carlo Cafiero, Pietro Cesare Ceccarelli, the Russian Stepniak and 30 other comrades. Another village in the same province, Gallo Matese, was also involved.

<doc id="222016" wikidata="Q562405" url="?curid=222016" title="Priest (manhwa)">
<text>Priest (Hangul: 프리스트) is a manhwa (Korean comic) series created by Hyung Min-woo. It fuses the Western genre with supernatural horror and dark fantasy themes and is notable for its unusual, angular art style. An interview with Hyung in &quot;Priest: Volume 3&quot; states that the comic was based on the computer game &quot;Blood&quot; by Monolith Productions, which featured a similar horror-Western aesthetic and undead protagonist. He has also cited the comic as a mishmash of influences from other books, movies and games, elements from a culture that he felt was underground in Korea at the time.
&quot;Priest&quot; was published in English by Tokyopop. The manhwa was loosely adapted into the 2011 American horror film of the same name.

==Story==
Priest tells the story of humanity&#x27;s battle against 12 fallen angels. The angels descended to Earth to &#x27;play God&#x27; among humans, who build a temple and statues in their honor. For their rebellion against him, God destroyed their temple, imprisoned their souls in statues, and buried the statues underground.

Centuries later, a Holy Knight named Vascar De Gullion loses his family. He &#x27;loses faith&#x27; and wanders the earth in a &#x27;blood rage.&#x27; He discovers a cave containing the statues of the 12 fallen angels. Temozarela convinces Vascar De Gullion to give up his body to the angel to take revenge against God. Vascar De Gullion is discovered by a powerful priest, Betheal. He discovers that Vascar De Gullion is actually Temozarela. Betheal traps their souls within a powerful weapon called the Domas Porada, becoming the demon Belial in the process.

Ivan Isaacs solves the puzzle of the Domas Porada, freeing Temozarela. The angel murders Isaacs&#x27; love, Gena, after escaping. Priest follows Ivan Isaacs&#x27; quest for revenge against the fallen angel, Temozarela, and his 12 angelic disciples, with assistance from Belial and others.

==Characters==
===Main===

====Ivan Isaacs====
The main protagonist of Priest. Ivan lived in an orphanage until Mr. Isaacs, a wealthy farm owner, adopted him after his wife died to be a companion for his daughter. Fond of ancient stories and myths, he spent his time researching in his own library and with Gena Isaacs, whom he eventually falls in love. When Mr. Isaacs finds out, he reprimands Ivan. His father sends him off to a boarding school called Conrad to get him away from Gena. Ivan returns after becoming a priest. An essay he wrote brings him to the attention of an Order of St. Vinetz. They approach him to help unlock the secrets of the Domas Porada, which contains the souls of Temozarela and Belial.

After reading through a book, Ivan finds blood in it and confronts Piestro. He admits his true plan is to let Temozarela free. Temozarela, realizing that Ivan could liberate him, tells Piestro to sacrifice Gena in front of the Domas Porada. During this, Ivan goes into a stupor and attempts to open the Domas Porada. He is transported inside the Domas Porada finding Temozarela imprisoned and Belial standing watch. Belial reprimands Isaac for entering the relic as the archangel breaks free.

Ivan stalks the west as an undead creature sustained solely by his infinite rage; his strength directly related to his anger. He also uses weapons: a Bowie knife he coats with blessed silver, a sawed off shotgun with silver bullets, and a Thompson sub-machine gun.

====Betheal Gavarre (Belial)====
Belial was originally an inquisitor in the medieval church called Betheal. He presided over the case of the possessed Vascar de Guillon. Temozarela, possessing Vascar, influences Betheal&#x27;s adoptive son, Matthew, to slaughter one of the women at the monastery. Temozarela orchestrated this tragedy to shatter Betheal&#x27;s faith. In remorse and enraged, Betheal sacrifices himself, condemns his faith, renounces God, and becomes the devil Belial. Betheal uses his new power to imprison Temozarela and himself in the Domas Porada. After Temozarela is freed, he melds with Ivan&#x27;s body to help him defeat the angels.

====Gena Isaacs====
The natural daughter of Mister Isaacs, a ranch owner who adopted Ivan. Gena eventually falls in love with Ivan despite being his adoptive sister, but is killed by Temozarela&#x27;s minions. The Order of St Vertinez uses her to make Ivan finally snap and release Temozarela. She is killed while calling Ivan&#x27;s name and dies in his arms. He brings Gena&#x27;s body back to the ranch. Belial appears and Ivan leaves her to talk with him. At this time, a servant of Temozarela, appears and raises the dead of a nearby graveyard. Ivan sees them and runs into the house for Gena, finding several zombies feeding on her flesh. Gena comes back to life as a zombie. She pleads with him to love her still, but he refuses at Belial&#x27;s words and stabs her with a scythe. After killing the zombies, he takes her corpse and buries her in a makeshift grave with a cross at the head.

Gena later appears as a visage to Ivan and other characters. Most notably, when Ivan is about to be killed by Achmode. Ivan finally begins to accept death and we see Gena in a field in front of him, before Armandiel saves him. She also appeared as a hallucination to Lizzie, saying nothing and just touching her heart after Lizzie almost succumbs to Temozarela.

====Coburn====
Coburn is a cynical atheist and a federal marshal hired by the government to investigate Ivan and Temozarela. He first appears saving Lizzie from being hung as a witch, then subsequently hires her to help him find Isaac. He reveals to Lizzie how he knew her father. During Ivan&#x27;s battle with Achmode, the group comes across Little Bosack ruined and inhabited by corpses. While Father Lucian stops to pray for the souls, every corpse comes alive and attacks them. Coburn protects the group with two guns and a whip.

Coburn tries to convince the mayor of Windtale that his city is in danger of an attack by Temozarela. His pleas are ignored, and Coburn leaves, remarking &#x27;Either way, this town is doomed&#x27;. Coburn reappears when the village is surrounded by members of St. Vertinez who are about to attack. In the fight, he duels with Joshua. Joshua stabs him above the heart, but Coburn withdraws the sword and gives it back to Joshua, saying &#x27;aim a bit higher.&#x27;

====Lizzie====
Lizzie is the leader of a gang of outlaws. The authorities catches her and places her on a train transporting her to be executed. After the gang massacres most of the train, they try to steal the cargo, but Ivan kills them. She witnesses Ivan&#x27;s battle with Jarbilong. While watching, a zombie bites her. Jarbilong tried to make Lizzie his disciple, but dies before succeeding. After the battle, Ivan visits her and tells her he will kill her unless she commits suicide before the curse takes control. During her recovery, she asks Ivan for help, but he ignores her, saying &#x27;Why do you ask me questions which God himself doesn&#x27;t answer?&#x27; She cuts her long hair and recruits a mysterious clan to help her quest against Ivan.

====Father Lucian====
The Vatican assigned Father Lucian to Coburn as a religious assistant in his pursuit of Ivan and Temozarela. He is calm and collected, preferring pacifism to violence. When Lizzie catches the plague, he heals her temporarily with holy water and prayer. After they find Ivan Isaacs, he reveals to Coburn that Betheal Gavarre is controlling Ivan. Lucian later appears with Coburn and attempts to persuade the townsfolk of Windtale to allow federal government into their town. When the Order of St. Vertinez surrounds Windtale, Lucian warns the mayor of Windtale about the impending danger. He notices the hanging body of Netraphim and speculates the town is going to Hell.

====Cairo====
Cairo is an Indigenous American (possibly of the Apache tribe) traveling with Coburn. He is skilled with knives, and throws them with fatal accuracy. He is an expert tracker sent to locate Ivan Isaacs. Later, he attacks members of St. Vertinez after witnessing them murder a small child from an infected village. He continues fighting before Antione, a member of St. Vertinez, murders and dismembers him. Seeing this, Coburn renounces the Vatican, saying &#x27;From now on, the cross will only be the sign of the enemy to me.&#x27;

===The Fallen Angels===
====Temozarela====

Temozarela is an arch-angel who fought on God&#x27;s side in the war against Lucifer. This war caused God to lose faith in the angels and begin preferring humanity. A bitter Temozarela took twelve empathetic angels to Earth to prove that humans were more fallible than angels. He set up a cult that worshiped him through ritual sacrifice. This only angered God and he banished Temozarela to the earth, imprisoning him in a statue. Years later, a Knight Templar called Vascar de Guillon fought in the crusades and led fearsome armies. His wife contracted a plague, but the doctors and priests said she was possessed by the devil. As a remedy, they burned de Guillon&#x27;s castle with his wife and children inside. He discovered a hidden cavern on his &quot;crusades of blood&quot; that imprisoned Temozarela and his disciples. Temozarela explained how he and Vascar were both betrayed by God. In his fury, he gives his body to Temozarela who releases his angels and uses them to possess the Vascar&#x27;s knights.

100 years later, Temozarela tries to seduce Betheal, but Betheal resists and eventually imprisons both himself and Temozarela in the Domas Porada. Belial and his battle causes Temozarela&#x27;s body to be horribly burned. His life is saved by four of his Dark Apostles: Netraphim, Jarbilong, Achmode, and Armand.

Temozarela&#x27;s actions are sometimes contradictory, indicating a deeper wish for Ivan to continue on his pilgrimage. He gives non-lethal powers to Jarbilong and slays Achmode after he eats Ivan&#x27;s arm. Belial tells Ivan that his quest for blood is Temozarela&#x27;s bidding, but Ivan ignores him.

====Jarbilong====
Jarbilong is one of the twelve Angels who rebelled against God with Temozarela. He was present at Temozarela&#x27;s release from the Domas Porada, but played little part in the battles with Belial. After this event he turns the townspeople of Saint Baldlas into zombies that attack Ivan. He has the &#x27;gift&#x27; of merging his spirit with any of his disciples at will, giving him an inexhaustible supply of bodies. Ivan used Voodoo magic to damage &quot;all&quot; of Jarbilong&#x27;s servants by attacking his soul instead of the angel&#x27;s body. Wounded, the 11th Angel revealed his hideous true form. Jarbilong impales Ivan on one of his arms. Belial possesses Ivan and defeats Jarbilong, eventually impaling the angel on his own blades. In his final moments before dying, Jarbilong tells Ivan that Temozarela could destroy him if he wished, but the angel has plans for him.

====Achmode====
The second Fallen Angel to battle Ivan on his pilgrimage, Achmode fancies himself both an artist and a beast. After turning a village into mindless zombies, Achmode creates undead killers and winged monstrosities by mutilating the zombie bodies. His sacred site is Small Bosack.

Ivan is confronted by Achmode&#x27;s latest modification, Christine, a child deformed into a hawk-like form. Achmode offers Ivan a glimpse of Christine&#x27;s &quot;dream&quot;, that retells the heretical angels&#x27; fall. When Ivan kills Christine with the Belial&#x27;s help, Achmode is further enraged by insults about his &#x27;glorious past&#x27; being little more than mindless instinct. Achmode decides to kill Ivan himself, despite Temozarela&#x27;s orders to the contrary. In their battle, Ivan&#x27;s best efforts to destroy Achmode fall short, and Belial demands that Ivan turn complete control of his body over to him. Ivan refuses. As Achmode is about to kill Ivan, Armandiel, Temozarela&#x27;s lieutenant, intervenes. He accuses Achmode of betraying their lord and slays him, saying &#x27;He does not resent your foolish yearning to enter heaven.&#x27; In a bizarre twist, Armandiel grants Ivan the severed arm of Achmode to replace his, saying that it will make him more than human and bolster his power.

====Armand/Armandiel====
He is possibly the most powerful of the Fallen Angels, especially considering his status of High Priest in Temozarela&#x27;s Black Sabbath. He is part of the party that rescues a burnt Temozarela from the Domas Porada. He is depicted as a handsome young man with long, straight hair, dressed in 19th century formal wear. In his first appearance, he gives Jarbilong his orders and advises him on how to fight Ivan and Belial. He is later pleased with Jarbilong&#x27;s defeat. He also is able to distract opponents with roses and the folds of his cape. Even though he is Ivan&#x27;s ally against Achmode, he later wounds Ivan so badly that Belial is unable to heal him.

====Netraphim====
Another of the Fallen Angels, Netraphim resembles a young woman and is accompanied by a giant wolf named Bendo. Against Temozarela&#x27;s orders, she protects the unfortunate in the valley of Windtale. Her alias is &#x27;Nera.&#x27; In heaven, she tried to stop Temozarela from leaving heaven, and had her wings ripped off as punishment. She asked to be killed because she was torn between her love for God and her secret attraction to Temozarela. Her life was spared and she joined Temozarela&#x27;s angels. While on Earth, she sees the young orphan Dana, and Netraphim decides to repent for her sins.

Armand delivers Temozarela&#x27;s word to Bendo, saying that Netraphim&#x27;s defiance will not be punished as long as she does not utter a single word of regret or remorse. If so, he will destroy her. When her &quot;family&quot; is killed, she allows the angry townspeople to hang her. Before she dies, Temozarela visits her and offers her a place by his side, provided she regrets her existence. She refuses and dies.

====Unnamed Figure====
This Unnamed Figure is seen during the events of Ivan&#x27;s fall from grace. Once Gena had been murdered, and the Domas Porada opened, a man arrived swathed in bandages bearing a lantern and a staff tipped with the symbol &#x27;II&#x27;. The staff secretes a fluid that releases the zombies. The dead eventually try to devour Gena before Ivan destroys them. After this, the figure&#x27;s lantern shatters setting fire to the graveyard and the mansion. He walks away prophesying &#x27;Ivan Isaacs, we will meet again one day.&#x27; As the &#x27;II&#x27; symbol occupies a space on Temozarela&#x27;s circle (seen often relating to the demise of Jarbilong and Archmode) it is possible this man is another Fallen Angel or servant of Temozarela.

===The Order of St. Vertinez===
The Vatican created the Order of St. Vertinez to handle what Coburn describes as &#x27;the vatican&#x27;s dirty laundry.&#x27; Their real name is &#x27;Michael&#x27;s Sword.&#x27; They have the authority to take matters into their own hands without the Pope&#x27;s knowledge. They are harsh and judgmental, killing anyone who disagrees with them as a service to the Church. Only 4 members are named. Their uniform consists of a white hooded robe with some members wearing masks.

====Father Raul Piestro====
Father Piestro was the head priest of Saint Vertinez before Temozarel&#x27;s release. In his first appearance, he visits Ivan about an essay he submitted on the ideology in the church. Piestro explains that he was part of the investigation into Ivan Isaac after he submitted his paper, revealing that his research findings are absolutely correct, but that he should stop further research to avoid punishment. He asks Ivan to help them solve The Domas Porada. After finding blood in one of the books, Ivan confronts Piestro. The head of St. Vertinez explains how he was visited by Temozarela in a dream and that he believes the archangel brought a new message from God. Afterwards, he kills Gena. When the Domas Porada is opened, Temozarela kills all the members of St. Vertinez, before killing Piestro and remarking, &#x27;Did you not ask to be rid of sin or desire?&#x27;

====Father Joshua====
One of possible current leaders of St. Vertinez, Joshua was recruited by Father Raul Piestro in an asylum. The asylum was run by Doctor Gerard, who St. Vertinez commissioned to create a new super-soldier. Joshua was one of only 3 who survived the process. He increased membership in the Order to reinforce his army against the heretics. He first appears praying at a ruined shrine with another priest, Antoine. Later, he takes part in wiping out an entire village that was infected by Temozarela&#x27;s plague with other priests. Joshua is indifferent when his comrades die, remarking only &#x27;Presume them martyrs&#x27;.

====Father Antoine====
Another possible leader of St. Vertinez, this priest has a marine-style haircut and has a hook instead of a left hand. During the experiments with Dr. Gerard, the drugs deformed his left hand rendering it useless. He cut it off and replaced it with an artificial device that could attach various implements for his use. He was held in the same asylum as Joshua and Baston before Piestro recruited him. The asylum&#x27;s experiments gave him super-regenerative capabilities. He first appears praying with Father Joshua, and helps him fight Cairo.

====Brother Baston====
Piestro recruited Baston from the same asylum as the others. He is the strongest of the surviving priests, surpassing all of the tests given to him by Doctor Gerard. From the experiments he gained heightened senses and super physical strength, presumably along with regeneration.

==In other media==
===MMO game===
A massively multiplayer online game based on the comic was in production by South Korean developer JC Entertainment back in 2003, but was later cancelled following being renamed &quot;Rust Online&quot;. Appropriately given the comic&#x27;s inspiration, the game attempted to meld in elements of first-person shooters; combat was real time and aiming and movement directly controlled by the player. Successful attacks brought players more experience points. The game featured two factions: Heretics, who side with Temozarela, and Templars who are more aligned with Ivan Isaacs. Players were then further divided into four weapons classes (leader, fighter, distance weapon and mage), with both demonic and spiritual abilities. Set among 48 different environments in New Mexico (including ghost towns, mines and desserts), factions would fight for control of twelve &quot;sacred sites&quot; which provide bonuses to the possessing faction. The conflict to control each of the counties containing these sites formed the basis of the main faction vs. faction mode. Other modes included single player and player vs. player. JC Entertainment described the game as controversial, owing to its graphic violence and religious mysticism. The game received extensive previews from The Adrenaline Vault and IGN&#x27;s RPG Vault.

===Film adaptation===

&quot;Priest&quot; is a 2011 action horror film loosely based on the manhwa, although the director claimed it was set in the comic&#x27;s far future. It is directed by Scott Stewart and stars Paul Bettany as the title character. The film was released on , 2011, in 2D and 3D. A prequel comic, &quot;Priest: Purgatory&quot;, was begun in an attempt to bridge the original manhwa with the movie, although it was never completed. Min Woo Hyung was largely supportive of the movie, praising the visuals, even if missing the comic&#x27;s philosophical aspects.

==Cultural influence==
The progressive metal band Dream Theater&#x27;s song &quot;In the Presence of Enemies&quot; features a storyline patterned after &quot;Priest&#x27;s&quot; plot with lyrics directly quoting the official English translation of Volume 1. A character called Priest also appears in the brawler game &quot;Lost Saga&quot; by South Korean developer I.O. Entertainment. It has also been regularly cited as an example for manhwa to Western audiences, as well as analysed for its religious content and cultural connections.

<text>Zacharias Manuel de la Rocha (born January 12, 1970) is an American musician, rapper, singer, songwriter, and political activist. He is best known as the vocalist and lyricist of the rock band Rage Against the Machine. Through both Rage Against the Machine and his activism, de la Rocha promotes left-wing politics in opposition to corporate America, the military-industrial complex, and government oppression.

==Early life==
De la Rocha was born in Long Beach, California, on January 12, 1970, to Robert &quot;Beto&quot; de la Rocha and Olivia Lorryne Carter. His father is a Mexican-American, with distant African and Sephardi Jewish heritage, while his mother was born to Manuel García Urias, a Mexican-American, and Olive Pearl Fleming, who was of German and Irish heritage. Beto was a muralist and a member of Los Four, the first Chicano art collective to be exhibited at a museum (LACMA, 1973). De la Rocha&#x27;s great grandfather, Jose Isaac de la Rocha Acosta (18821920), was a Mexican revolutionary who fought in the Mexican Revolution. His maternal grandfather, Manuel García, was originally from Sonora and worked as an agricultural laborer in the U.S. De la Rocha would later see the hardships his grandfather endured reflected in the struggles of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation.

De la Rocha&#x27;s parents divorced when he was six, and he moved from East Los Angeles to Irvine with his mother, who attended the University of California, Irvine and earned a PhD in anthropology. De la Rocha later described Irvine as &quot;one of the most racist cities imaginable&quot; and said that &quot;if you were a Mexican in Irvine, you were there because you had a broom or a hammer in your hand.&quot;

==Musical career==

===Early career===

De la Rocha met Tim Commerford in elementary school. In junior high school, they both played guitar in a band called Juvenile Expression. De la Rocha&#x27;s interest in punk rock bands like The Clash, The Misfits, Sex Pistols, and Bad Religion turned into an appreciation for other bands like Minor Threat, Bad Brains, and The Teen Idles. In 1987, he joined the straight edge band Hard Stance. In 2018, Indecision Records officially released Hard Stance&#x27;s entire discography.

===Inside Out===

By 1988, singer Eric Ernst had departed from Hard Stance, leading to de la Rocha taking on lead vocals. Now lacking a guitarist, the remaining members contacted Vic DiCara, whom some knew from their previous band that never made it past rehearsals. This act, now named Inside Out, began writing music heavily inspired by acts like Minor Threat and Bad Brains, and soon were associated with the youth crew movement. Their sole release was the 1990 EP No Spiritual Surrender, issued through Revelation Records.

Towards the end of the band&#x27;s lifetime, DiCara and de la Rocha&#x27;s writing styles began to fracture. De la Rocha wished to push the groups into a more political and hip hop-inspired direction, particularly influenced by Run-DMC, whereas DiCara wished for the band to write more music inspired by Hare Krishna. While de la Rocha&#x27;s influence was prevalent on performed yet unreleased Inside Out tracks like &quot;Darkness of Greed&quot; and &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot;, the band broke up because of this conflict in 1991. De la Rocha later said that the band was &quot;about completely detaching ourselves from society to see ourselves as ... as spirits, and not bowing down to a system that sees you as just another pebble on a beach. I channeled all my anger out through that band.&quot;

The band had a brief reunion in 1993, performing in a number of locations including multiple in Salt Lake City.

===Rage Against the Machine===

Following the dissolution of Inside Out in 1991, de la Rocha embraced hip hop and began freestyling at local clubs, at one of which he was approached by former Lock Up guitarist Tom Morello, who was impressed by de la Rocha&#x27;s lyrics, and convinced him to form a band. Morello recruited former Greta drummer Brad Wilk–who had previously auditioned for Lock Up before that band&#x27;s dissolution earlier that same year–and de la Rocha recruited his former Juvenile Expression bandmate, Tim Commerford, to play bass. The band was named after an unreleased Inside Out record, &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot;.

Rage Against the Machine released their debut album in 1992 to critical and commercial success. The band was on the main stage at Lollapalooza by 1993 and was one of the most politically charged bands ever to receive extensive airplay from radio and MTV. Rage&#x27;s second and third albums peaked at number one in the United States, but did not result in the political action de la Rocha had hoped for. He became increasingly restless and undertook collaborations with artists such as KRS-One, Chuck D, and Public Enemy. He left Rage Against the Machine in October 2000, citing &quot;creative differences,&quot; at which time he issued a statement saying: &quot;it was necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed&quot;, in reference to the disagreement over the release of &quot;Renegades&quot;. The other members of the band sought out separate management and secured the immediate release of &quot;Renegades&quot;. After searching for a replacement for de la Rocha, the other members of Rage joined Chris Cornell of Soundgarden to form Audioslave.

===Solo career===
Following the disbandment of Rage Against the Machine, de la Rocha worked on a solo album he had been recording since before the band&#x27;s dissolution, working with DJ Shadow, El-P, Muggs, Dan The Automator, Roni Size, DJ Premier and Questlove with production partner James Poyser. The album never came to fruition, and de la Rocha started a new collaboration with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, in which around 20 tracks were produced. Reznor thought the work was &quot;excellent&quot;, but said the songs will likely never be released as de la Rocha was not &quot;ready to make a record&quot; at that time.
On working with DJ Shadow and Reznor, de la Rocha admitted in a 2008 interview that:

In 2000, de la Rocha appeared on the song &quot;Centre of the Storm&quot;, from the Roni Size/Reprazent album &quot;In The Mode&quot;, while in 2002, he appeared in a minor role in the first part of the Blackalicious song &quot;Release&quot; on the album &quot;Blazing Arrow&quot;. A new collaboration between de la Rocha and DJ Shadow, the song &quot;March of Death&quot; was released for free online in 2003 in protest against the imminent invasion of Iraq. As part of the collaboration de la Rocha released a statement which included the following:

The 2004 soundtrack &quot;Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; included one of the collaborations with Reznor, &quot;We Want It All&quot;. This album also contained &quot;No One Left&quot;, the debut recording by former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello as The Nightwatchman. On October 7, 2005, de la Rocha returned to the stage with new material, performing with Son Jarocho band Son de Madera. He later spoke as MC and again performed with Son de Madera at the November 22 Concert at the Farm, a benefit concert for the South Central Farmers. He sang and played the jarana with the band, and performed his own new original material, including the song &quot;Sea of Dead Hands&quot;.
On September 8, 2016, it was reported that de la Rocha&#x27;s first solo album was complete and would be released in early 2017. The news came with a new song, produced by El-P, called &quot;Digging for Windows&quot; that was released on YouTube and BitTorrent. However, to date, the album remains unreleased with no further announcements made.

===Rage Against the Machine reunion===

Rumors that Rage Against the Machine could reunite at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival were circulating in mid-January 2007 and were confirmed on January 22. The band was confirmed to be headlining the final day of Coachella 2007. Rage Against the Machine, as a full band, headlined the final day of the 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 29. The band played in front of a Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival. The performance was initially thought to be a one-off, but this turned out not to be the case. The band played 7 more shows in the United States in 2007, and in January 2008, they played their first shows outside the US as part of the Big Day Out Festival in Australia and New Zealand. The band continued to tour around the world, headlining many large festivals in Europe and the United States, including Lollapalooza in Chicago and the Reading and Leeds Festivals. In a 2008 interview, de la Rocha said this of the relationship between him, Commerford, Wilk and Morello:

Later in 2011, de la Rocha and the rest of Rage Against the Machine reunited for one final show, which would headline LA Rising on July 30, 2011. The show filled the LA Coliseum.

A second reunion tour was announced for the spring of 2020. The band was scheduled to perform 52 shows (39 in the United States, 5 in Canada, and 8 in Europe) from March 26 to September 12 but were forced to postpone the tour until 2022 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was eventually cancelled after de la Rocha tore his Achilles tendon halfway through the second show.

===One Day as a Lion===

In 2008, de la Rocha and former Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore formed One Day as a Lion. They later added Joey Karam of The Locust on keyboards for their live shows. The group combines rock drumming, electro keyboards, and hip-hop vocals. De la Rocha played keyboards as well as providing vocals, with Theodore on the drums for their self-titled EP. They released their debut EP, &quot;One Day as a Lion&quot;, on July 22, 2008.

===Other projects===
For a brief period in 1988, de la Rocha played drums for hardcore punk band No For An Answer, even playing on their debut EP &quot;You Laugh&quot;.

In 1989, de la Rocha joined Farside, playing guitar in the group until 1991.

In 1991, de la Rocha formed a band with John Porcelly based at the Revelation Records headquarters in Huntington Beach, California, in which de la Rocha was the vocalist and Porcelly played guitar. Although the group never officially had a name, at one point in time, de la Rocha proposed the name &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot;, however Porcelly believed the name to be too long, leading to de la Rocha using it as the name for his other band at the time. The band&#x27;s music merged elements of hardcore punk and hip hop.

==Activism==
De la Rocha advocates in favor of Leonard Peltier, Mumia Abu-Jamal, and the Zapatista (EZLN) movement in Mexico. He spoke on the floor of the UN, testifying against the United States and its treatment of Abu-Jamal. De la Rocha has been particularly outspoken on the cause of the EZLN. De la Rocha and Rage Against The Machine hosted a benefit show in January 1999 alongside the Beastie Boys to raise attention towards Abu-Jamal&#x27;s case. The concert was mired in controversy as New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman denounced the show and encouraged people not to attend; the show ultimately sold out.
Zack&#x27;s Chicano identity informed his band&#x27;s commitment to what they view as the struggles of immigrants, people of color, and the Zapatistas. He renamed the People&#x27;s Resource Center in Highland Park to the &quot;Centro de Regeneracion&quot;. There, many of the same artists and activists who had participated in the struggle over the Peace and Justice Center maintained their commitment to providing youth a space for cultural expression and training. Along with music workshops and the development of Radio Clandestina, Centro members also organized graffiti workshops and youth film festivals. The Centro lasted only two years; within that timespan it was viewed by its members and staff as an important space in the ongoing institutionalization of the community politics, cultural practices, and social networks of the Eastside scene in the nineties.
The EZLN and de la Rocha&#x27;s experiences with them inspired the songs &quot;People of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Wind Below&quot; and &quot;Without a Face&quot; from &quot;Evil Empire&quot;, and &quot;War Within a Breath&quot; from &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot;. Zack de la Rocha asked their record label, Epic Records, for $30,000 to donate to the EZLN. It is not known if they complied. The EZLN flag has been used as a stage backdrop at all of the band&#x27;s shows since their reunion in April 2007. On his post-Rage political music, de la Rocha admitted that it was near impossible for him to draw the line between politics and music.
On April 14, 2007, Morello and de la Rocha reunited on-stage early to perform a brief acoustic set at House of Blues in Chicago at the rally for fair food with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW). Morello described the event as &quot;very exciting for everybody in the room, myself included&quot;. At Rage&#x27;s first reunion show, de la Rocha made a speech during &quot;Wake Up&quot; in which de la Rocha called numerous American presidents war criminals, citing a statement by Noam Chomsky regarding the Nuremberg Principles.

Like bandmate Tom Morello, Zack de la Rocha is vegetarian. In an interview, he stated, &quot;I think vegetarianism is really great, and I stand really strongly behind it. I think that an animal goes through a lot of pain in the whole cycle of death in the slaughterhouse; just living to be killed. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth eating that animal. There&#x27;s so much other food out there that doesn&#x27;t have to involve you in that cycle of pain and death.&quot;

In November 2023, de la Rocha attended a pro-Palestinian protest in Washington, D.C. and signed an open letter calling for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war.

<text>ISO 3166-2 is part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and defines codes for identifying the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. The official name of the standard is &quot;Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions – Part 2: Country subdivision code&quot;. It was first published in 1998.

The purpose of ISO 3166-2 is to establish an international standard of short and unique alphanumeric codes to represent the relevant administrative divisions and dependent territories of all countries in a more convenient and less ambiguous form than their full names. Each complete ISO 3166-2 code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen:
* The first part is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the country;
* The second part is a string of up to three alphanumeric characters, which is usually obtained from national sources and stems from coding systems already in use in the country concerned, but may also be developed by the ISO itself.

Each complete ISO 3166-2 code can then be used to uniquely identify a country subdivision in a global context.

 there are 5,046 codes defined in ISO 3166-2. For some countries, codes are defined for more than one level of subdivisions.

==Current codes==
The following table can be used to access the current ISO 3166-2 codes of each country, and comprises three columns:

* Entry: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, click to view the ISO 3166-2 codes of the country
* Country name: English short name officially used by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA)
* Subdivisions assigned codes: Number and category of subdivisions assigned codes in ISO 3166-2; if there are more than one level of subdivisions, the first-level subdivisions are shown in &quot;italics&quot;

==Subdivisions included in ISO 3166-1==
For the following countries, a number of their subdivisions in ISO 3166-2, most of them dependent territories, are also officially assigned their own country codes in ISO 3166-1:

; Notes
==Format==
The format of the ISO 3166-2 codes is different for each country. The codes may be alphabetic, numeric, or alphanumeric, and they may also be of constant or variable length. The following is a table of the ISO 3166-2 codes of each country (those with codes defined), grouped by their format: 

==Changes==
The ISO 3166/MA updates ISO 3166-2 when necessary. Changes in ISO 3166-2 consist mostly of spelling corrections, addition and deletion of subdivisions, and modification of the administrative structure.

ISO used to announce changes in newsletters which updated the currently valid standard, and releasing new editions which comprise a consolidation of newsletter changes. As of July 2013, changes are published in the online catalogue of ISO only and no newsletters are published anymore. Past newsletters remain available on the ISO website.

<doc id="222031" wikidata="Q672980" url="?curid=222031" title="Forsythia">
<text>Forsythia , is a genus of flowering plants in the olive family Oleaceae. There are about 11 species, mostly native to eastern Asia, but one native to southeastern Europe. &quot;Forsythia&quot; – also one of the plant&#x27;s common names – is named after the botanist William Forsyth.

==Description==
&quot;Forsythia&quot; are deciduous shrubs typically growing to a height of and, rarely, up to with rough grey-brown bark. The leaves are borne oppositely and are usually simple, though sometimes trifoliate with a basal pair of small leaflets; they range between in length and, rarely, up to , with a margin that is serrated or entire (smooth). Twigs may be hollow or chambered, depending on the species.

The flowers are produced in the early spring before the leaves, bright yellow with a deeply four-lobed flower, the petals joined only at the base. These become pendent in rainy weather thus shielding the reproductive parts.
The fruit is a dry capsule, containing several winged seeds.

There is a long-standing belief that forsythia flowers produce lactose, but lactose occurs only very rarely in natural sources other than milk, and attempts to find lactose in forsythia have been unsuccessful.

The genus is named after William Forsyth (1737–1804), a Scottish botanist who was a royal head gardener and a founding member of the Royal Horticultural Society.

==Species==

The following species of &quot;Forsythia&quot; have been documented:
* &quot;Forsythia europaea&quot; – Balkans in Albania and Serbia
* &quot;Forsythia giraldiana&quot; – northwest China
* &quot;Forsythia&quot; × &quot;intermedia&quot; – an artificial garden hybrid between &quot;F. suspensa&quot; and &quot;F. viridissima&quot;
* &quot;Forsythia japonica&quot; – Japan
* &quot;Forsythia koreana&quot; – Korea
* &quot;Forsythia likiangensis&quot; – southwest China
* &quot;Forsythia&quot; × &quot;mandschurica&quot; – northeast China
* &quot;Forsythia mira&quot; – north central China
* &quot;Forsythia ovata&quot; – Korea
* &quot;Forsythia saxatilis &quot; – Korea
* &quot;Forsythia suspensa&quot; – eastern and central China
* &quot;Forsythia togashii&quot; – Japan (Shōdoshima)
* &quot;Forsythia velutina&quot; – Korea
* &quot;Forsythia viridissima&quot; – eastern China

A genetic study does not fully match the traditionally accepted species listed above, and groups the species in four clades: (1) &quot;F. suspensa&quot;; (2) &quot;F. europaea—F. giraldiana&quot;; (3) &quot;F. ovata—F. japonica—F. viridissima&quot;; and (4) &quot;F. koreana—F. mandschurica—F. saxatilis&quot;. Of the additional species, &quot;F. koreana&quot; is usually cited as a variety of &quot;F. viridissima&quot;, and &quot;F. saxatilis&quot; as a variety of &quot;F. japonica&quot;; the genetic evidence suggests they may be better treated as distinct species.

Forsythias are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the brown-tail and Gothic moth.

==Garden history==

Two species of forsythia are at the heart of the selected forms and garden hybrids: &quot;Forsythia suspensa&quot; and &quot;F. viridissima&quot;. &quot;These two species are, as it were, the founder-members of the forsythia family&quot; writes Alice Coats; they were the earliest species brought into Western gardens from the Far East and they have each played a role in the modern garden shrubs.

&quot;Forsythia suspensa&quot;, the first to be noticed by a Westerner, was seen in a Japanese garden by the botanist-surgeon Carl Peter Thunberg, who included it (as a lilac) in his &quot;Flora Japonica&quot; 1784. Thunberg&#x27;s professional connections lay with the Dutch East India Company, and &quot;F. suspensa&quot; reached Holland first, by 1833. In England, when it was being offered by Veitch Nurseries in Exeter at mid-century, it was still considered a rarity. Not all the varieties of &quot;suspensa&quot; are splaying and drooping, best seen hanging over a retaining wall; an erect form found by Fortune near Peking in 1861 was for a time classed as a species—&quot;F. fortunei&quot;.

&quot;Forsythia viridissima&quot;, meanwhile, had overtaken it in European gardens. The Scottish plant-hunter Robert Fortune &quot;discovered&quot; it—in a mandarin garden of the coastal city of Chusan (Zhoushan)—before he ever saw it growing wild in the mountains in Zhejiang province.

&quot;Forsythia&quot; × &quot;intermedia&quot;, as its name suggests, is a hybrid of &quot;F. suspensa&quot; and &quot;F. viridissima&quot;, introduced in continental Europe about 1880. Repeated crosses of the same two parents have made reiterations of &quot;F. &quot;× &quot;intermedia&quot; quite variable. A bud sport of a particularly showy (&quot;spectabilis&quot;) form is widely marketed as &quot;F. &quot;× &quot;intermedia&quot; &#x27;Lynwood Variety&#x27;. This cultivar has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit, as have &quot;F. &quot;× &quot;intermedia&quot; Week End &#x27;Courtalyn&#x27; and &quot;F.&quot; Marée d&#x27;Or &#x27;Courtasol&#x27;.

About the time of the First World War further species were discovered by plant hunters in China: &quot;F. giraldian&quot; (found in Gansu, 1910) and &quot;F. ovata&quot; (collected from seed in Korea by E.H. Wilson) have been particularly useful as seed parents in 20th-century American crosses.

==Cultivation and uses==

&quot;Forsythia&quot; are early spring-flowering shrubs with yellow blooms, often seen in private gardens, public landscaping works and parks—notably during Eastertide), when some of the plants are nicknamed &quot;Easter Tree&quot; in honor of the coming spring. Two species/hybrids are commonly cultivated for ornamental use, &quot;Forsythia × intermedia&quot; and &quot;F. suspensa&quot;. They are grown in several climates and gardening zones, prized for being tough and reliable perennial plants. &quot;F. × intermedia&quot; is the more commonly grown, smaller plant and has an upright habit with vivid flowers. &quot;F. suspensa&quot; is a large to very large shrub with paler blossoms, and can be grown in a weeping shape on banks. Many named garden cultivars can also be found. Budding &quot;Forsythia&quot; cuttings are frequently brought indoors, for their opening blooms, in the early spring.

Vegetative propagation is usually achieved via cuttings, taken from green wood after flowering in late spring to early summer. Alternatively, cuttings may be taken between November and February, though this may reduce the flowering spectacle of the following spring. Low-hanging boughs that touch the ground will often take root, adding to the total mass of the plant, but can be removed for transplanting. A common practice (known as layering) is to place a weight over a branch to keep it on the ground and, after it has rooted, to dig up the roots and cut the rooted part from the main branch; this can then be planted.

&quot;Forsythia suspensa&quot; is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs in Chinese herbology. Forsythia sticks are used to bow a Korean string instrument called &quot;ajaeng&quot;.

==Common names==
In some regions, the plant may be known as Easter tree and the flowers as &quot;yellow bells&quot;. In Iran, the plant is known as &quot;yellow Jasmine&quot;.

<doc id="222032" wikidata="Q432184" url="?curid=222032" title="Opalinidae">
<text>The opalines are a small group of peculiar heterokonts, currently assigned to the family Opalinidae, in the order Slopalinida. Their name is derived from the opalescent appearance of these microscopic organisms when illuminated with full sunlight. Most opalines live in the large intestine and cloaca of anurans (frogs and toads), though they are sometimes found in fish, reptiles, molluscs and insects; whether they are parasitic is not certain. The unusual features of the opalines, first observed by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1683, has led to much debate regarding their phylogenetic position among the protists.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The relationship between opalines and other protists has been a subject of great controversy since the late 19th century, and is not completely resolved at present. Initially, microscopists believed that the thousands of rhythmically beating hair-like structures which cover their surface were cilia, and they placed the opalines in Ciliophora. In the early 20th century other aspects of opaline biology clearly differentiated them from the ciliates and they were placed in Sarcomastigophora, with the amoebae and flagellates. In the 1980s, detailed ultrastructural studies of &quot;Opalina ranarum&quot; revealed that they share many features with the heterokonts of the family Proteromonadidae. A new order—Slopalinida Patterson 1985—was proposed to include the members of the families Proteromonadidae Grassé 1952 and Opalinidae Claus 1874. In 2004, the first reliable opaline genetic sequence data supported the monophyletic nature of the order Slopalinida. The authors of that study considered the opalines to be a family (Opalinidae) within the order Slopalinida.

There are currently about 200 recognized species of opalines in 5 genera: &quot;Opalina&quot; Purkinje and Valentin 1835, &quot;Protoopalina&quot; Metcalf 1918, &quot;Cepedea&quot; Metcalf 1920, &quot;Zelleriella&quot; Metcalf 1920, and &quot;Protozelleriella&quot; Delvinquier et al. 1991. Two additional genera, &quot;Hegneriella&quot; Earl 1971 and &quot;Bezzenbergeria&quot; Earl 1973, have not been considered as valid by subsequent authors (p. 249) The 5 recognized genera differ in terms of the number of nuclei, the appearance and location of the falx (two short, sickle-shaped rows of flagella), and whether the long rows of flagella (called &quot;kineties&quot;) cover the body evenly or if there is a &quot;bald spot&quot;. Due to the differences in body shape among the different life cycle stages within a species, the use of overall body shape - whether flat or cylindrical - to differentiate the genera has been de-emphasized.

==Life cycle==

Like many parasites, the life cycle of opalines is rather complex . The most comprehensive study published so far concluded that the life cycles of 10 &quot;Opalina&quot; species, 1 &quot;Zelleriella&quot; species and 1 &quot;Protoopalina&quot; species are all &quot;remarkably similar&quot; (p. 321). A more recent study found that &quot;Cepedea couillardi&quot; fits the standard opaline life cycle model described below, while that of &quot;Opalina proteus&quot; is completed entirely in the tadpole stage of the host. Very little is known about the life cycles of opalines in fish, reptile or arthropod hosts.

Asexual phase in adult anuran host. The basic opaline life cycle begins with the large, multinucleate trophonts in the adult anuran cloaca. Through much of the year, the trophonts grow and divide continually to yield more trophonts. Nuclear divisions maintain the appropriate number of nuclei during this phase. As the host&#x27;s breeding season approaches, the trophonts enter a phase known as palintomy — a series of cell divisions with little or no overall growth or nuclear divisions. The resulting opalines, which become gradually smaller with fewer nuclei per individual, are called tomonts. At some point the small tomonts undergo encystment, and the cysts are released into the environment (i.e. the breeding pool of the anuran host) along with the feces.

Sexual and asexual phases in larval anuran host. Once cysts are eaten by foraging tadpoles, they excyst (hatch) to yield gamonts. The gamonts divide further, including a meiotic division, to yield haploid gametes. Each gamete has only one nucleus and may be either a microgamete or a macrogamete. Conjugation occurs between one microgamete and one macrogamete, to yield a diploid zygocyst with one nucleus. The zygocyst has two possible fates. It may be shed along with the feces of the tadpole host; and if eaten by another tadpole, it will excyst (hatch) to yield more gamonts in the new host. Alternatively, the zygocyst may excyst in its original host and grow into a multinucleate protrophont. In this case, the protrophont grows into a trophont and the whole cycle starts over again. The cycle from protrophont to cyst may occur in either the tadpole or adult hosts. Some evidence suggests that the life cycle transitions of opalines may be governed by the hormonal cycles of the host.

==Hosts and commensal lifestyle==

Lacking a mouth, opalines feed by taking in nutrients from their surroundings by pinocytosis. While the opalines are often referred to as &quot;parasites&quot;, two lines of evidence suggest that they are actually commensals which do no harm to their anuran hosts.

# They are found almost exclusively in the large intestine and cloaca. Since the anuran absorbs the nutrients from its food in the small intestine, the opalines are probably not depriving their hosts of nutrients. It is believed that the opalines are simply living off the &quot;left-over&quot; nutrients in the feces, possibly supplemented by the biochemical contributions of the rich bacterial flora which also reside there.
# Anuran hosts containing many thousands of opalines appear to be completely healthy, with no obvious irritation or other pathological signs on their intestinal or cloacal walls.

Only about a dozen reports of opalines in fishes have been published, and even fewer on opalines from reptile or salamander hosts. Their scarcity outside of anuran hosts had led many to speculate that the others are just incidental infestations—maybe the infested snake had just eaten an infested frog, for example. However, opalines have been found in saltwater fish which have no access to anurans. Also, the populations of opalines in fish hosts are often very high, suggesting that they are probably reproducing in the fish host.

The pathogenicity (if any) of opalines in fish hosts is not yet known. One study found no irritation or other pathological signs on the rectal epithelium of &quot;Symphysodon aequifasciata&quot; infested with &quot;Protoopalina symphysodonis&quot;, but stated that &quot;most infected animals died&quot;.

==In vitro culture of opalines==

Successful culturing of opalines in artificial media for periods of 1 month or more has been reported. This technique will aid tremendously in future studies of all aspects of opaline biology.

<text>Social software, also known as social apps or social platform includes communications and interactive tools that are often based on the Internet. Communication tools typically handle capturing, storing and presenting communication, usually written but increasingly including audio and video as well. Interactive tools handle mediated interactions between a pair or group of users. They focus on establishing and maintaining a connection among users, facilitating the mechanics of conversation and talk. &quot;Social software&quot; generally refers to software that makes collaborative behaviour, the organisation and moulding of communities, self-expression, social interaction and feedback possible for individuals. Another element of the existing definition of &quot;social software&quot; is that it allows for the structured mediation of opinion between people, in a centralized or self-regulating manner. The most improved area for social software is that Web 2.0 applications can all promote co-operation between people and the creation of online communities more than ever before. The opportunities offered by social software are instant connections and opportunities to learn. An additional defining feature of social software is that apart from interaction and collaboration, it aggregates the collective behaviour of its users, allowing not only crowds to learn from an individual but individuals to learn from the crowds as well. Hence, the interactions enabled by social software can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.

== Types ==

=== Instant messaging ===

An &quot;instant messaging&quot; application or client allows one to communicate with another person over a network in real time, in relative privacy. One can add friends to a contact or buddy list by entering the person&#x27;s email address or messenger ID. If the person is online, their name will typically be listed as available for chat. Clicking on their name will activate a chat window with space to write to the other person, as well as read their reply.

=== Text chat ===

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and other online chat technologies allow users to join and communicate with many people at once, publicly. Users may join a pre-existing chat room or create a new one about any topic. Once inside, you may type messages that everyone else in the room can read, as well as respond to/from others. Often there is a steady stream of people entering and leaving. Whether you are in another person&#x27;s chat room or one you&#x27;ve created yourself, you are generally free to invite others online to join you in that room.

=== Collaborative software ===

The goal of collaborative software, also known as groupware, such as Moodle, Landing pages, Enterprise Architecture, and SharePoint, is to allow subjects to share data – such as files, photos, text, etc. for the purpose of project work or schoolwork. The intent is to first form a group and then have them collaborate. Clay Shirky defines social software as &quot;software that supports group interaction&quot;. Since groupware supports group interaction (once the group is formed), it would consider it to be social software.

=== Internet forums ===

Originally modeled after the real-world paradigm of electronic bulletin boards of the world before internet was widely available, &quot;internet forums&quot; allow users to post a &quot;topic&quot; for others to review. Other users can view the topic and post their own comments in a linear fashion, one after the other. Most forums are public, allowing anybody to sign up at any time. A few are private, gated communities where new members must pay a small fee to join.

Forums can contain many different categories in a hierarchy, typically organized according to topics and subtopics. Other features include the ability to post images or files or to quote another user&#x27;s post with special formatting in one&#x27;s own post. Forums often grow in popularity until they can boast several thousand members posting replies to tens of thousands of topics continuously.

There are various standards and claimants for the market leaders of each software category. Various add-ons may be available, including translation and spelling correction software, depending on the expertise of the operators of the bulletin board. In some industry areas, the bulletin board has its own commercially successful achievements: free and paid hardcopy magazines as well as professional and amateur sites.

Current successful services have combined new tools with the older newsgroup and mailing list paradigm to produce hybrids. Also, as a service catches on, it tends to adopt characteristics and tools of other services that compete. Over time, for example, wiki user pages have become social portals for individual users and may be used in place of other portal applications.

=== Wikis ===

In the past, web pages were only created and edited by web designers that had the technological skills to do so. Currently there are many tools that can assist individuals with web content editing. Wikis allow novices to be on the same level as experienced web designers because wikis provide easy rules and guidelines. Wikis allow all individuals to work collaboratively on web content without having knowledge of any markup languages. A wiki is made up of many content pages that are created by its users. Wiki users are able to create, edit, and link related content pages together. The user community is based on the individuals that want to participate to improve the overall wiki. Participating users are in a democratic community where any user can edit any other user&#x27;s work.

=== Blogs ===

Blogs, short for web logs, are like online journals for a particular person. The owner will post a message periodically, allowing others to comment. Topics often include the owner&#x27;s daily life, views on politics, or about a particular subject important to them.

Blogs mean many things to different people, ranging from &quot;online journal&quot; to &quot;easily updated personal website.&quot; While these definitions are technically correct, they fail to capture the power of blogs as social software. Beyond being a simple homepage or an online diary, some blogs allow comments on the entries, thereby creating a discussion forum. They also have blogrolls (i.e., links to other blogs which the owner reads or admires) and indicate their social relationship to those other bloggers using the XFN social relationship standard. Pingback and trackback allow one blog to notify another blog, creating an inter-blog conversation. Blogs engage readers and can build a virtual community around a particular person or interest. Blogging has also become fashionable in business settings by companies who use enterprise social software.

=== Collaborative real-time editors ===

Simultaneous editing of a text or media file by different participants on a network was first demonstrated on research systems as early as the 1970s, but is now practical on a global network. Collaborative real-time editing is now utilized, for example, in film editing and in cloud-based office applications.

=== Prediction markets ===

Many prediction market tools have become available (including some free software) that make it easy to predict and bet on future events. This software allows a more formal version of social interaction, although it qualifies as a robust type of social software.

=== Social network services ===

Social network services allow people to come together online around shared interests, hobbies or causes. For example, some sites provide meeting organization facilities for people who practice the same sports. Other services enable business networking and social event meetup.

Some large wikis have effectively become social network services by encouraging user pages and portals.

=== Social network search engines ===
Social network search engines are a class of search engines that use social networks to organize, prioritize or filter search results. There are two subclasses of social network search engines: those that use explicit social networks and those that use implicit social networks.

*Explicit social network search engines allow people to find each other according to explicitly stated social relationships. XHTML Friends Network allows people to share their relationships on their own sites, thus forming a decentralized/distributed online social network, in contrast to centralized social network services listed in the previous section.
*Implicit social network search engines allow people to filter search results based upon classes of social networks they trust, such as a shared political viewpoint. This was called an epistemic filter in the 1993 &quot;State of the Future Report&quot; from the American Committee for the United Nations University which predicted that this would become the dominant means of search for most users.

Lacking trustworthy explicit information about such viewpoints, this type of social network search engine mines the web to infer the topology of online social networks. For example, the NewsTrove search engine infers social networks from content - sites, blogs, pods and feeds - by examining, among other things, subject matter, link relationships and grammatical features to infer social networks.

=== Deliberative social networks ===
Deliberative social networks are webs of discussion and debate for decision-making purposes. They are built for the purpose of establishing sustained relationships between individuals and their government. They rely upon informed opinion and advice that is given with a clear expectation of outcomes.

=== Commercial social networks ===
Commercial social networks are designed to support business transaction and to build a trust between an individual and a brand, which relies on opinion of product, ideas to make the product better, enabling customers to participate with the brands in promoting development, service delivery and a better customer experience.

=== Social guides ===
A social guide recommending places to visit or contains information about places in the real world, such as coffee shops, restaurants and wifi hotspots, etc.

=== Social bookmarking ===

Some web sites allow users to post their list of bookmarks or favorite websites for others to search and view them. These sites can also be used to meet others through sharing common interests. Additionally, many social bookmarking sites allow users to browse through websites and content shared by other users based on popularity or category. As such, use of social bookmarking sites is an effective tool for search engine optimization and social media optimization for webmasters.

Enterprise bookmarking is a method of tagging and linking any information using an expanded set of tags to capture knowledge about data. It collects and indexes these tags in a web-infrastructure server residing behind the firewall. Users can share knowledge tags with specified people or groups, shared only inside specific networks, typically within an organization.

=== Social viewing ===

Social viewing allows multiple users to aggregate from multiple sources and view online videos together in a synchronized viewing experience.

=== Social cataloging ===

In social cataloging much like social bookmarking, this software is aimed towards academics. It allows the user to post a citation for an article found on the internet or a website, online database like Academic Search Premier or LexisNexis Academic University, a book found in a library catalog and so on. These citations can be organized into predefined categories, or a new category defined by the user through the use of tags. This method allows academics researching or interested in similar areas to connect and share resources.

=== Social libraries ===
This application allows visitors to keep track of their collectibles, books, records and DVDs. Users can share their collections. Recommendations can be generated based on user ratings, using statistical computation and network theory. Some sites offer a buddy system, as well as virtual &quot;check outs&quot; of items for borrowing among friends. Folksonomy or tagging is implemented on most of these sites.

=== Social online storage ===
Social online storage applications allow their users to collaboratively create file archives containing files of any type. Files can either be edited online or from a local computer, which has access to the storage system. Such systems can be built upon existing server infrastructure or leverage idle resources by applying P2P technology. Such systems are social because they allow public file distribution and direct file sharing with friends.

=== Social network analysis ===
Social network analysis tools analyze the data connection graphs within social networks, and information flow across those networks, to identify groups (such as cliques or key influencers) and trends. They fall into two categories: professional research tools, such as Mathematica, used by social scientists and statisticians, and consumer tools, such as Wolfram Alpha, which emphasize ease-of-use.

=== Virtual worlds ===

Virtual Worlds are services where it is possible to meet and interact with other people in a virtual environment reminiscent of the real world. Thus, the term virtual reality. Typically, the user manipulates an avatar through the world, interacting with others using chat or voice chat.

==== Massively multiplayer online games ====

MMOGs are virtual worlds (also known as virtual environments) that add various sorts of point systems, levels, competition and winners and losers to virtual world simulation. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) are a combination of role-playing video games and massively multiplayer online games

==== Non-game worlds ====
Another development are the worlds that are less game-like or not games at all. Games have points, winners and losers. Instead, some virtual worlds are more like social networking services like MySpace and Facebook, but with 3D simulation features.

==== Economies ====

Very often a real economy emerges in these worlds, extending the non-physical service economy within the world to service providers in the real world. Experts can design dresses or hairstyles for characters, go on routine missions for them and so on, and be paid in game money to do so. This emergence has resulted in expanding social possibility and also in increased incentives to cheat. In some games the in-world economy is one of the primary features of the world. Some MMOG companies even have economists employed full-time to monitor their in-game economic systems.

=== Other specialized social applications ===
There are many other applications with social software characteristics that facilitate human connection and collaboration in specific contexts. Social Project Management and e-learning applications are among these.

== Vendor lists ==
Various analyst firms have attempted to list and categorize the major social software vendors in the marketplace. Jeremiah Owyang of Forrester Research has listed fifty &quot;community software&quot; platforms. Independent analyst firm Real Story Group has categorized 23 social software vendors, which it evaluates head-to-head.

== Politics and journalism ==
Use of social software for politics has also expanded drastically especially over 2004–2006 to include a wide range of social software, often closely integrated with services like phone trees and deliberative democracy forums and run by a candidate, party or caucus.

Open politics, a variant of open-source governance, combines aspects of the free software and open content movements, promoting decision-making methods claimed to be more open, less antagonistic, and more capable of determining what is in the public interest with respect to public policy issues. It is a set of best practices from citizen journalism, participatory democracy and deliberative democracy, informed by e-democracy and netroots experiments, applying argumentation framework for issue-based argument and a political philosophy, which advocates the application of the philosophies of the open-source and open-content movements to democratic principles to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy, as with a wiki document. Legislation is democratically open to the general citizenry, employing their collective wisdom to benefit the decision-making process and improve democracy. Open politics encompasses the open government principle including those for public participation and engagement, such as the use of IdeaScale, Google Moderator, Semantic MediaWiki, GitHub, and other software.

Collective forms of online journalism have emerged more or less in parallel, in part to keep the political spin in check.

== Comparison of communication and interactive tools ==
Communication tools are generally . By contrast, interactive tools are generally synchronous, allowing users to communicate in real time (phone, net phone, video chat) or near-synchronous (IM, text chat).

Communication involves the content of talk, speech or writing, whereas interaction involves the interest users establish in one another as individuals. In other words, a communication tool may want to make access and searching of text both simple and powerful. An interactive tool may want to present as much of a user&#x27;s expression, performance and presence as possible. The organization of texts and providing access to archived contributions differs from the facilitation of interpersonal interactions between contributors enough to warrant the distinction in media.

== Emerging technologies ==

Emerging technological capabilities to more widely distribute hosting and support much higher bandwidth in real time are bypassing central content arbiters in some cases.

=== Virtual presence ===

Widely viewed, &quot;virtual presence&quot; or telepresence means being present via intermediate technologies, usually radio, telephone, television or the internet. In addition, it can denote apparent physical appearance, such as voice, face and body language.

More narrowly, the term virtual presence denotes presence on World Wide Web locations, which are identified by URLs. People who are browsing a web site are considered to be virtually present at web locations. Virtual presence is a social software in the sense that people meet on the web by chance or intentionally. The ubiquitous (in the web space) communication transfers behavior patterns from the real world and virtual worlds to the web. Research has demonstrated effects of online indicators

== Debates or design choices ==
Social software may be better understood as a &quot;set&quot; of debates or design choices, rather than any particular list of tools. Broadly conceived, there are many older media such as mailing lists and Usenet fora that qualify as &quot;social&quot;. However, most users of this term restrict its meaning to more recent software genres such as blogs and wikis. Others suggest that the term &quot;social software&quot; is best used not to refer to a single type of software, but rather to the use of two or more modes of computer-mediated communication that result in &quot;community formation.&quot; In this view, people form online communities by combining one-to-one (e.g. email and instant messaging), one-to-many (Web pages and blogs) and many-to-many (wikis) communication modes. Some groups schedule real life meetings and so become &quot;real&quot; communities of people that share physical lives.

Most definers of social software agree that they seem to facilitate &quot;bottom-up&quot; community development. The system is classless and promotes those with abilities. Membership is voluntary, reputations are earned by winning the trust of other members and the community&#x27;s missions and governance are defined by the members themselves.

Communities formed by &quot;bottom-up&quot; processes are often contrasted to the less vibrant collectivities formed by &quot;top-down&quot; software, in which users&#x27; roles are determined by an external authority and circumscribed by rigidly conceived software mechanisms (such as access rights). Given small differences in policies, the same type of software can produce radically different social outcomes. For instance, Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware has a fine-grained permission system of detailed access control so the site administrator can, on a page-by-page basis, determine which groups can view, edit or view the history. By contrast, MediaWiki avoids per-user controls, to keep most pages editable by most users and puts more information about users currently editing in its recent changes pages. The result is that Tiki can be used both by community groups who embrace the social paradigm of MediaWiki and by groups who prefer to have more content control.

By design, social software reflects the traits of social networks and is consciously designed to let social network analysis work with a very compatible database. All social software systems create links between users, as persistent as the identity those users choose. Through these persistent links, a permanent community can be formed out of a formerly epistemic community. The ownership and control of these links - who is linked and who is not - is in the hands of the user. Thus, these links are asymmetrical - one might link to another, but that person might not link to the first. Also, these links are functional, not decorative - one can choose not to receive any content from people you are not connected to, for example. Wikipedia user pages are a very good example and often contain extremely detailed information about the person who constructed them, including everything from their mother tongue to their moral purchasing preferences.

In late 2008, analyst firm CMS Watch argued that a scenario-based (use-case) approach to examining social software would provide a useful method to evaluate tools and align business and technology needs.

Methods and tools for the development of social software are sometimes summarized under the term Social Software Engineering. However, this term is also used to describe lightweight and community-oriented development practices.

== Theory ==
Constructivist learning theorists such as Vygotsky, Leidner and Jarvenpaa have theorized that the process of expressing knowledge aids its creation and that conversations benefit the refinement of knowledge. Conversational knowledge management software fulfills this purpose because conversations, e.g. questions and answers, become the source of relevant knowledge in the organization. Conversational technologies are also seen as tools to support both individual knowledge workers and work units.

Many advocates of Social Software assume, and even actively argue, that users create actual communities. They have adopted the term &quot;online communities&quot; to describe the resulting social structures.

== History ==
Christopher Allen supported this definition and traced the core ideas of the concept back through Computer Supported Cooperative or Collaborative Work (CSCW) in the 1990s, Groupware in the 1970s and 1980s, to Englebart&#x27;s &quot;augmentation&quot; (1960s) and Bush&#x27;s &quot;Memex&quot; (1940s). Although he identifies a &quot;lifecycle&quot; to this terminology that appears to reemerge each decade in a different form, this does not necessarily mean that social software is simply old wine in new bottles.

The augmentation capabilities of social software were demonstrated in early internet applications for communication, such as e-mail, newsgroups, groupware, virtual communities etc. In the current phase of Allen&#x27;s lifecycle, these collaborative tools add a capability &quot;that aggregates the actions of networked users.&quot; This development points to a powerful dynamic that distinguishes social software from other group collaboration tools and as a component of Web 2.0 technology. Capabilities for content and behavior aggregation and redistribution present some of the more important potentials of this media. In the next phase, academic experiments, Social Constructivism and the open source software movement are expected to be notable influences.

Clay Shirky traces the origin of the term &quot;social software&quot; to Eric Drexler&#x27;s 1987 discussion of &quot;hypertext publishing systems&quot; like the subsequent World Wide Web, and how systems of this kind could support software for public critical discussion, collaborative development, group commitment, and collaborative filtering of content based on voting and rating.

&quot;Social technologies&quot; (or &quot;conversational technologies&quot;) is a term used by organizations (particularly &quot;network-centric organizations&quot;). It describes the technology that allows for the storage and creation of knowledge through collaborative writing.

=== Timeline ===
In 1945, Vannevar Bush described a hypertext-like device called the &quot;memex&quot; in his &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; article &quot;As We May Think&quot;.

In 1962, Douglas Engelbart published his seminal work, &quot;Augmenting Human Intellect: a conceptual framework.&quot; In this paper, he proposed using computers to augment training. With his colleagues at the Stanford Research Institute, Engelbart started to develop a computer system to augment human abilities, including learning. Debuting in 1968, the system was simply called the oNLine System (NLS).

In the same year, Dale McCuaig presented the initial concept of a global information network in his series of memos entitled &quot;On-Line Man Computer Communication&quot;, written in August 1962. However, the actual development of the internet must be credited to Lawrence G. Roberts of MIT, along with Leonard Kleinrock, Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf.

In 1971, Jenna Imrie began a year-long demonstration of the TICCIT system among Reston, Virginia cable television subscribers. Interactive television services included informational and educational demonstrations using a touch-tone telephone. The National Science Foundation re-funded the PLATO project and also funded MITRE&#x27;s proposal to modify its TICCIT technology as a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system to support English and algebra at community colleges. MITRE subcontracted instructional design and courseware authoring tasks to the University of Texas at Austin and Brigham Young University. Also during this year, Ivan Illich described computer-based &quot;learning webs&quot; in his book &quot;Deschooling Society&quot;.

In 1980, Seymour Papert at MIT published &quot;Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas&quot; (New York: Basic Books). This book inspired a number of books and studies on &quot;microworlds&quot; and their impact on learning. BITNET was founded by a consortium of US and Canadian universities. It allowed universities to connect with each other for educational communications and e-mail. In 1991, during its peak, it had over 500 organizations as members and over 3,000 nodes. Its use declined as the World Wide Web grew.

In 1986, Tony Bates published &quot;The Role of Technology in Distance Education&quot;, reflecting on ways forward for e-learning. He based this work on 15 years of operational use of computer networks at the Open University and nine years of systematic R&amp;D on CAL, viewdata/videotex, audio-graphic teleconferencing and computer conferencing. Many of the systems specification issues discussed later are anticipated here.

Though prototyped in 1983, the first version of Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE) was installed in 1986 on a small network of Cemcorp ICON computers, at an elementary school in Toronto, Canada. CSILE included text and graphical notes authored by different user levels (students, teachers, others) with attributes such as comments and thinking types which reflect the role of the note in the author&#x27;s thinking. Thinking types included &quot;my theory&quot;, &quot;new information&quot;, and &quot;I need to understand.&quot; CSILE later evolved into Knowledge Forum.

In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, then a young British engineer working at CERN in Switzerland, circulated a proposal for an in-house online document sharing system which he described as a &quot;web of notes with links.&quot; After the proposal was grudgingly approved by his superiors, he called the new system the World Wide Web.

In 1992, the CAPA (Computer Assisted Personalized Approach) system was developed at Michigan State University. It was first used in a 92-student physics class in the fall of 1992. Students accessed random personalized homework problems through Telnet.

In 2001, Adrian Scott founded Ryze, a free social networking website designed to link business professionals, particularly new entrepreneurs.

In February 2002, the suvi.org Addressbook started its service. It was the first service that connected people together. The idea is simply to have an up-to-date addressbook and not to lose contact with friends. Other people on the globe had the same idea. Friendster, Facebook and many other services were successors to this.

In April 2002, Jonathan Abrams created his profile on Friendster.

In 2003, Hi5, LinkedIn, MySpace, and XING were launched.

In February 2004, Facebook was launched.

In 2004, Levin (in Allen 2004, sec. 2000s) acknowledged that many of characteristics of social software (hyperlinks, weblog conversation discovery and standards-based aggregation) &quot;build on older forms.&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;the difference in scale, standardization, simplicity and social incentives provided by web access turn a difference in degree to a difference in kind.&quot; Key technological factors underlying this difference in kind in the computer, network and information technologies are: filtered hypertext, ubiquitous web/computing, continuous internet connectivity, cheap, efficient and small electronics, content syndication strategies (RSS) and others. Additionally, the convergence of several major information technology systems for voice, data and video into a single system makes for expansive computing environments with far reaching effects.

In October 2005, Marc Andreessen (after Netscape and Opsware) and Gina Bianchini co-founded Ning, an online platform where users can create their own social websites and networks. Ning now runs more than 275,000 networks, and is a &quot;white label social networking providers, often being compared to Kickapps, Brightcove, rSitez and Flux. StudiVZ was launched in November 2005.

In 2009, the Army&#x27;s Program Executive Office - Command, Control, and Communications Tactical (PEO-C3T) founded milSuite capturing the concepts of Wiki, YouTube, Blogging, and connecting with other members of the DOD behind a secure firewall. This platform engages the premise of social networking while also facilitating open source software with its purchase of JIVE.

==Criticism==
===Exponential generation of resource consuming negative externalities===

When a person or business sends a message to a network of people this generates an
exponential process that can consume considerable amounts of resources - most importantly human time.
This approach can have a beneficial effect on those interested in the message, but can also consume time of people not interested in the message. It can also create in many a social obligation to look - albeit briefly - at the message - particularly when it is from someone you know or consider to be a friend.

When a message is completely unwanted and unsolicited, this is a form of information pollution and is often known as spam. When a message is from a network of friends, and wanted by some but not all, it generates negative externalities in that it consumes valuable resources (time).

Some examples:
Bill sends an email or social message to 20 friends. Of these 2 are very interested, 8 become interested,
the rest are not interested but may read all or part of the message anyway, spending their time.
Some of these 20 people will forward the message to their friends. The process repeats - resulting
in an exponentially increasing consumption of time by those uninterested in the message (as well
as an exponentially increasing consumption of time by people who are or become interested - which may
distract them from other more productive tasks). Eventually, when the expected number of people forwarding
a message drops below 1, the process dies out, but in the interim it may circulate widely - resulting
in a potentially massive waste of resources. Much of the time wasted will be due to a sense
of social obligation to at least scan or check on the title of the message.

====Social networking in a work environment====

Bill works for ACME company and sends out an email memo or network message to 20 coworkers.
Some have to read the message (for example if Bill is their boss or a senior person in the hierarchy), others will just scan it - even if they are uninterested. Some may comment on it - sharing the response with multiple recipients, others may forward it to others. Some may not want to read the message but may feel obligated to read and respond. The outgoing process of sharing or forwarding takes very little time but may produce exponentially growing time demands on others. Over time, employees may find more of their time devoted to social networking demands at work - including scanning, reading, commenting upon, forwarding, and responding to messages. These social work-obligations may crowd out more productive activities resulting in longer hours with less efficiency.

In a sense, social networking at work is similar to a large ongoing group meeting. Sometimes excellent results occur, but other times major amounts of time are wasted. Sometimes output benefits from everyone&#x27;s input and ongoing consultation, other times, individual work without constant obligation to check in and gain consensus may be more productive. The output of a &quot;committee&quot; is sometimes worse than that of an individual or small team.

===Information overload and arbitrary filtering of communication===

As information supply increases, the average time spent evaluating individual content has to decrease. Eventually, much communication is summarily ignored - based on very arbitrary and rapid heuristics that will filter out the information for example by category. Bad information crowds out the good - much the way SPAM often crowds out potentially useful unsolicited communications.

===Cyberbullying===

Cyber bullying is different than conventional bullying. Cyber bullying refers to the threat or abuse of a victim by the use of the internet and electronic devices. Victims of cyber bullying can be targeted over social media, email, or text messages. These attacks are typically aggressive, and repetitive in nature. Internet bullies can make multiple email, social media, etc. accounts to attack a victim. Free email accounts that are available to end users can lead a bully to use various identities for communication with the victim. Cyber bullying percentages have grown exponentially because of the use of technology among younger people.

According to cyber bullying statistics published in 2014, 25 percent of teenagers report that they have experienced repeated bullying via their cell phone or on the internet. 52 percent of young people report being cyber bullied. Embarrassing or damaging photographs taken without the knowledge or consent of the subject has been reported by 11 percent of adolescents and teens. Of the young people who reported cyber bullying incidents against them, 33 percent of them reported that their bullies issued online threats. Often, both bullies and cyber bullies turn to hate speech to victimize their target. One-tenth of all middle school and high school students have been on the receiving end of &quot;hate terms&quot; hurled against them. 55 percent of all teens who use social media have witnessed outright bullying via that medium. 95 percent of teens who witnessed bullying on social media report that others, like them, have ignored the behavior.

<text>Beneath the Remains is the third studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, released on April 7, 1989. It was their first release by Roadrunner Records.

Continuing in the death/thrash metal vein of its predecessor &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; (1987), the album had improved production and songwriting compared to the band&#x27;s previous works. In time it would be acclaimed as a classic in the thrash metal genre. According to vocalist Max Cavalera, Sepultura had &quot;really found [their] style&quot; on this album. In January 2013, &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; was inducted into &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame, becoming the second Sepultura album to do so, the first being &quot;Roots&quot;. This induction would make Sepultura the first band to have more than one of their albums being featured in the Decibel Hall of Fame.

== Cover art ==
This was their first album to feature a Michael Whelan cover art. Sepultura had initially planned on using another Michael Whelan cover art, &quot;Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre&quot;; Igor Cavalera had even gone so far as to get part of the painting tattooed on his arm. Roadrunner Records convinced Sepultura to use &quot;Nightmare in Red&quot; as they felt it was better suited for &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot;. Monte Conner of Roadrunner later sent the original artwork to Obituary, who used it on their album, &quot;Cause of Death&quot;, which was released a year after &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot;. For years after the incident, Igor Cavalera was upset with Monte Conner for giving away their album cover.

The cover art is acrylics over pastels.

== Background and recording ==
Max Cavalera travelled to New York in February 1988 and spent a whole week negotiating with the Roadrunner label. Although they offered a seven-record deal to Sepultura, the label was unsure of the band&#x27;s sale potential. The album&#x27;s budget was a small amount by the label&#x27;s standards ($8,000), but in the end the cost was almost twice its original budget.

Scott Burns, who had previously engineered records by death metal acts Obituary, Death and Morbid Angel, was the chosen producer. Burns agreed to work for a low fee ($2,000) because he was curious about Brazil. Sepultura spent the last half of December 1988 recording the album at &quot;Nas Nuvens Studio&quot; in Rio de Janeiro, from 8 pm to 5 am. The studio was specifically chosen because it was the one where some years before Brazilian rock band Titãs had recorded their classic album &quot;Cabeça Dinossauro&quot;, which impressed Sepultura. Burns had brought some drum equipment and Mesa Boogie amps to Brazil (a rare item for production standards at the time) which helped to improve the sound quality.

The album&#x27;s sound incorporates elements of death metal and thrash metal, as well as influences from Black Sabbath and the early U2 and Corrosion of Conformity albums.

== Reception ==

&quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; has received critical acclaim. AllMusic writer Eduardo Rivadavia noted that the album &quot;marked the band&#x27;s transition from third-world obscurity to major contenders in the international extreme metal arena&quot;, and called it &quot;one of the most essential death/thrash metal albums of all time.&quot; Adam McCann of Metal Digest called &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; a &quot;real heavy metal classic&quot;.

<text>Andrew M. Greeley (February 5, 1928 – May 29, 2013) was an American Catholic priest, sociologist, journalist and novelist. He was a professor of sociology at the University of Arizona and the University of Chicago, and a research associate with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC). 

For many years, Greeley wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and contributed regularly to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;, &quot;America&quot;, and &quot;Commonweal&quot;.

==Life and career==
Greeley was born into a large Irish Catholic family in Oak Park, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago) in 1928. He grew up during the Great Depression in Chicago&#x27;s Austin neighborhood, where he attended St. Angela Elementary School, and by the second grade, he knew that he wanted to be a priest. After studying at Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago, Greeley received an AB degree from St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in Chicago in 1950, a Bachelor of Sacred Theology (STB) in 1952, and a Licentiate of Sacred Theology (STL) in 1954, when he was ordained for the Archdiocese of Chicago.

From 1954 to 1964, Greeley served as an assistant pastor at Christ the King parish in Chicago, during which time he studied sociology at the University of Chicago. His first book, &quot;The Church in the Suburbs (1958)&quot;, was drawn from notes a sociology professor had encouraged him to take describing his experiences. He received a Master of Arts in 1961 and a PhD in 1962. His doctoral dissertation dealt with the influence of religion on the career plans of 1961 college graduates. At various times, Greeley was a professor at the University of Arizona, the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Chicago. He was denied tenure by the University of Chicago in 1973, despite having been a faculty member there for a decade and having published dozens of books; he attributed the denial to anti-Catholic prejudice, although a colleague said his cantankerous temperament was more to blame. In 1991, he was granted a professorship in social science at the University.

==Sociology==
As a sociologist, he published a large number of influential academic works during the 1960s and 1970s, including &quot;Unsecular Man: The Persistence of Religion&quot; (1972) and &quot;The American Catholic: A Social Portrait&quot; (1977). Over the course of his career, he authored more than 70 scholarly books, largely focusing on the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. His early work challenged the widespread assumption that Catholics had low college attendance rates, showing that white Catholics were in fact more successful than other whites in obtaining college undergraduate and graduate degrees, which he attributed to what he called the high-quality education Catholics received in parochial schools. He also studied how religion influenced the political behavior of ethnic Catholics, and he was one of the first scholars to document the sociological effects of the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s reforms on American Catholics.

In the early 1970s, the U.S. bishops commissioned him to write a profile of the American priesthood. He completed a two-year survey in 1972, reporting that dissatisfaction among the priests was widespread; but the bishops rejected his findings. Greeley said, &quot;Honesty compels me to say that I believe the present leadership in the church to be morally, intellectually and religiously bankrupt.&quot;

Greeley&#x27;s sociological work was also viewed with suspicion by some of his fellow clerics, and his archbishop (later cardinal), John Cody, denied Greeley&#x27;s request for a parish ministry. Greeley criticized Cody, calling him a &quot;madcap tyrant&quot; when Cody closed a number of inner-city schools.

==Interpreting American Catholicism==
Greeley&#x27;s biographer summarizes his interpretation:

As described by John L. Allen Jr. of the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;, Greeley became fascinated with what has been called the Catholic &quot;analogical imagination&quot;, the idea that &quot;visible, tangible things in the created order serve as metaphors for the divine, as opposed to the more textual and literal religious sensibility of Protestants and others.&quot; Greeley believed that it was this viewpoint that had led the church to be a pre-eminent patron of the arts through the centuries, allowing it to communicate through artistic imagery spiritual concepts that doctrinal texts alone could not. Greeley&#x27;s appreciation for the spiritual power of art inspired him to begin writing works of fiction.

==Fiction==
Greeley&#x27;s literary output was such it was said that he &quot;never had an unpublished thought&quot;. He said, &quot;The only way I can write fiction is to keep those hours from 6:00 to 9:00 A.M. sacred.&quot; He published his first novel, &quot;The Magic Cup&quot;, in 1975, a fantasy tale about a young king who would lead Ireland from paganism to Christianity. A second novel, &quot;Death in April&quot;, followed in 1980.

His third novel, &quot;The Cardinal Sins&quot; (1981), was his first work of fiction to become a major commercial success. As one reviewer put it, &quot;The Cardinal Sins&quot; &quot;did for the Catholic Church what &quot;The Godfather&quot; did for the mafia&quot;. The novel&#x27;s principal characters were both priests—one a writer-sociologist (like Greeley), and the other a Cardinal who had broken the vow of celibacy. At the time of the book&#x27;s release, Chicago&#x27;s cardinal, John Cody, was the subject of allegations of having diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Church to a mistress. Church officials accused Greeley of using the novel to attack Cardinal Cody, although Greeley denied the charges and told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that Cody was &quot;a much better bishop ... and a much better human being&quot; than the character in the novel.

&quot;The Cardinal Sins&quot; was followed by the Passover trilogy: &quot;Thy Brother&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1982), &quot;Ascent into Hell&quot; (1983), and &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; (1984). Thereafter, he wrote a minimum of two novels per year, on average. In 1987 alone, he produced four novels and two works of non-fiction. He once said that he wrote an average of 5,000 words per day, and was known to quip, &quot;Why should I practice contraception on my ideas?&quot;

The explicit treatment of sexuality in Greeley&#x27;s novels was a source of controversy for some. The &quot;National Catholic Register&quot; said that Greeley had &quot;the dirtiest mind ever ordained&quot;. Greeley responded to his critics by saying that &quot;there is nothing wrong with sex&quot; and that &quot;at the most basic level, people learn from the novels that sex is good ... Then they get the notion that sexual love is a sacrament of God&#x27;s love, that sexual love tells us something about God.&quot; He told one interviewer that his erotic writing was not pornography and that it was &quot;less erotic than the &quot;Song of Songs&quot; in the scriptures&quot;. He insisted that from what they heard in confession from women, priests probably knew more about marriage than most married men; and he drew on this knowledge to write a marital advice book he called &quot;Sexual Intimacy&quot; (1988).

At the height of the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal, Greeley wrote &quot;The Priestly Sins&quot; (2004), a novel about a young priest who is exiled to an insane asylum and then to an academic life because he reports abuse that he has witnessed. His book &quot;The Making of the Pope&quot; (2005) was intended as a follow-up to his &quot;The Making of the Popes 1978&quot;. &quot;The Making of the Pope&quot; (2005) was a first-hand account of the coalition-building process by which the conservative Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ascended to the papacy as Benedict XVI. Greeley also dabbled in science fiction, writing the novels &quot;God Game&quot; and &quot;The Final Planet&quot;.

Greeley wrote about the spiritual life in his prayer journals &quot;that revealed a man who most of all wanted to love God and let people know that God was a Tremendous Lover who loved them as if He loved them alone and loved everyone as if all of them were one&quot;. &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1992) was his first prayer journal, a winner of the Catholic Association book award in the spiritual category, followed by &quot;Sacraments of Love&quot; (1994), &quot;Windows&quot; (1995), &quot;I Hope You&#x27;re Listening, God&quot; (1997), and &quot;Letters To A Loving God&quot; (2002). The prayer journal was neither a book of prayers nor a book about prayer but rather an experience of praying, to dialogue with God. It is prayer as it happens. He said that writing out prayers on a computer screen for his journals &quot;are the best way to pray I&#x27;ve yet discovered.&quot; Thus, paraphrasing a famous quote about him, it might be said he &quot;never had an unpublished prayer&quot;. Leach said, &quot;The prayer journals were among his favorite books.&quot;

Greeley wrote his first major collection of poetry entitled &quot;The Sense of Love&quot; (1992), taking his place among the priest poets of the Anglo-Roman tradition, as he examined the love relationship between God and humanity on the levels of eros (sexual), philos (social), and agape (spiritual) (Robert McGovern, foreword, &quot;The Sense of Love&quot;, 1992, pp. viii-xi).

==Politics==
Politically, Greeley was an outspoken critic of the George W. Bush administration and the Iraq War, and a strong supporter of immigration reform. His book titled &quot;A Stupid, Unjust, and Criminal War: Iraq 2001–2007&quot; (2007) was critical of the rush by the Bush administration to start the Iraq War and the consequences of that war for the United States. Garry Wills wrote, &quot;Andrew Greeley shows that Jesus is the Prince of Peace, not a Captain of War.&quot;

==Priesthood==
Reflecting on his life&#x27;s work, Greeley told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1992, &quot;I&#x27;m a priest, pure and simple ... The other things I do — sociological research, my newspaper columns, the novels I write — are just my way of being a priest. I decided I wanted to be one when I was a kid growing up on the West Side. I&#x27;ve never wavered or wanted to be anything but.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
Greeley was probably the best-selling priest in history, with an estimated 250,000 readers who would buy almost every novel he published, probably generating at least $110 million in gross income by 1999. He was able to live comfortably in Chicago&#x27;s John Hancock Center, but he donated most of his earnings to the Church and other charities. In 1984, he contributed $1 million to endow a chair in Roman Catholic Studies at the University of Chicago. In 1986, he established a $1 million private educational fund for scholarships and financial support to inner-city schools in the Chicago Archdiocese with a minority student body of more than 50%. He had originally offered the donation to the Archdiocese, but the then Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, had declined the gift without ever publicly offering an explanation. In 2003, the Archdiocese accepted the $420,000 that still remained in the fund to bolster a newly established Catholic Schools Endowment Fund, providing scholarships for low-income students and for raising teachers&#x27; salaries in the Archdiocese&#x27;s schools. Greeley also funded an annual lecture series, &quot;The Church in Society&quot;, at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, Mundelein, Illinois, where he had earned his S.T.L. in 1954.

In 2008, he donated several thousand dollars to the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, who was then serving as a U.S. Senator representing Illinois, although Greeley predicted that racism would lead to Obama&#x27;s defeat.

==Injury and death==
Greeley suffered skull fractures in a fall in 2008 when his clothing got caught on the door of a taxi as it pulled away; he was hospitalized in critical condition. He remained in poor health for the rest of his life and died on May 29, 2013, at his Chicago home. He was 85.

==Honors==
Greeley was awarded honorary degrees from the University of Arizona, Bard College (New York State) and the National University of Ireland, Galway. In 1981, he received the F. Sadlier Dinger Award, which is presented each year by educational publisher William H. Sadlier, Inc. in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the ministry of religious education in America.

<doc id="222043" wikidata="Q123758171" url="?curid=222043" title="Local government in Wales">
<text>Local government in Wales is primarily undertaken by the twenty-two principal councils. The councils are unitary authorities, meaning they are responsible for providing local government services within their principal area, including education, social work, environmental protection, and most highway maintenance. The principal areas are divided into communities, most of which have an elected community council. The services provided by community councils vary, but they will typically maintain public spaces and facilities. Local councils in Wales are elected; the most recent local elections in Wales took place in 2022, and the next are due to take place in 2027.

==Governance==
Local government is generally supervised by the (devolved) Welsh Ministers, who allocate funding of the majority of local government yearly revenue and capital settlements. The Government of Wales Act 2006 gave the Welsh Ministers the responsibility of setting up a scheme on how they are to propose and exercise their functions for the promotion and sustainability of Welsh local government.

=== Principal councils ===
Like councils throughout the UK, Welsh councils are composed of elected councillors and local government elections normally take place every four years. The Wales Act 2017 prevents local government elections from taking place in the same year as elections to the Senedd, meaning the May 2021 local elections to were postponed to May 2022. There are currently 22 principal areas (styled as a &quot;county&quot; or a &quot;county borough&quot;) in Wales, with the current configuration established in the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, enacted on 1 April 1996, while the framework was established earlier in the Local Government Act 1972. Like community councils, they are composed of councillors.

Councils are required by law to hold annual general meetings, including after their election. In this meeting the council&#x27;s chair or presiding member would be elected. Some councils also elect an individual to perform civic and ceremonial duties, usually known as a mayor and deputy mayor, with some styled as lord mayor.

Council decisions may be taken by the entire council, some legally defined committees (e.g. scrutiny, audit, licensing, planning and governance committees), or by the council&#x27;s executive, largely made up of a majority of councillors. All principal councils in Wales have an executive leader and cabinet, although directly-elected mayor model can be adopted by a council if there is public support through a referendum. Some decisions are required by law to be voted on by the entire council, such as the council budget and the amount of council tax. Most committees must be &quot;politically balanced&quot;, proportionally representative of the council&#x27;s political make up. Councils in Wales cannot operate a &quot;committee&quot; system as done in England.

All principal councils have to prepare and agree on a council constitution by law. It would also have to be kept up to date, published electronically, and revised when amended.

==== Responsibilities ====
The principal councils of Wales, have responsibility and deliver over 700 local government services. These include:

* Education – e.g. School transport and adult learning
* Housing – e.g. Provide accommodation for people in need and maintain social housing
* Social Care/Services – e.g. to protect and care for children, disabled and elderly people
* Highways and Transport – maintain local roads and manage traffic flow
* Waste Management – Waste collection and recycling
* Leisure and Cultural Services – e.g. libraries, leisure services and arts venues
* Consumer Protection – enforce trading standards and licensing taxis
* Environmental Health and Services – e.g. monitoring food safety in local pubs and restaurants, control local pollution
* Planning – manage local development and building safety
* Economic Development – attract new businesses and encourage tourism
* Emergency Planning – e.g. for floods or terrorist attacks

==== List of principal councils ====
The 22 principal councils of Wales are:

* Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council
* Bridgend County Borough Council
* Caerphilly County Borough Council
* Cardiff Council
* Carmarthenshire County Council
* Ceredigion County Council
* Conwy County Borough Council
* Denbighshire County Council
* Flintshire County Council
* Gwynedd Council
* Isle of Anglesey County Council
* Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council
* Monmouthshire County Council
* Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council
* Newport City Council
* Pembrokeshire County Council
* Powys County Council
* Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council  
* City and County of Swansea Council
* Torfaen County Borough Council
* Vale of Glamorgan Council
* Wrexham County Borough Council

=== Community councils ===
At the lowest level of administrative subdivision in Wales are the communities, into which each principal area is subdivided. They may have elected community councils which perform a number of roles, such as providing local facilities, and representing their communities to larger local government bodies. Community councils are the equivalent of English parish councils. A community council may call itself a &quot;town council&quot; if it so wishes. The councils of three communities with city status – Bangor, St Asaph, and St Davids – are known as &quot;city councils&quot;. Communities which are too small to have a council may have a community meeting instead: an example of direct democracy. The communities in the urban areas of the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport do not have community councils.

Every part of Wales is covered by a community. There are 878 communities in Wales, however only 734 communities have a community council (also styled as a &quot;town council&quot; for some communities). The current configuration of communities was established in the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, while the framework was established earlier in the Local Government Act 1972. Like principal councils, they are made up of councillors.

Before 1974, Wales had civil parishes, like in England, until they were replaced with communities. The communities initially followed the boundaries of the civil parishes they replaced.

===Elections===
Council elections in Wales are held every five years. Councils are not allowed to have more regular elections where a third of their members are elected instead. By elections can occur for councils if a seat is made vacant, such as following resignation, however by-elections cannot be held within 6 months of a council-wide election.

Each council, both principal and community, are divided into electoral wards, which are decided by the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales. Some wards may be represented by more than one member, and therefore are called &quot;multi-member&quot; wards.

Councils can choose between running their elections with the first-past-the-post voting (FPTP) system or the single transferable vote (STV) system. First-past-the-post has been used as the sole voting system to elect councils in Wales since their establishment in the late 19th century.

Anyone over 16 and a legal resident of Wales can vote in local government elections, when registered to vote.

==== Electoral wards ====
The principal council areas&#x27; boundaries are made from a collection of electoral wards. Each unitary authority has roughly 40 electoral wards within them on average. There are 762 electoral wards in Wales.

As of 2021, the average resident population in an electoral ward in Wales was around 4 000. More populated wards are usually in larger urban areas. If boundary changes are made to electoral wards they are usually enacted on the first Thursday in May each year, in line with local government elections.

== Other local government ==

=== Fire and rescue authorities ===
Three fire and rescue authorities were established in Wales in 1996: Mid and West Wales Fire Authority, North Wales Fire Authority and South Wales Fire Authority. These are considered to be &quot;local government&quot; by the Welsh Government.

The fire authorities&#x27; powers and duties were set out in the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 (Part 2). Their core responsibilities are:

* promoting fire safety
* fire-fighting
* road traffic accident response
* handling other prescribed emergencies

=== National park authorities ===

There are three national park authorities in Wales, covering the country&#x27;s three national parks. They are Bannau Brycheiniog National Park Authority (Brecon Beacons), Eryri National Park Authority (Snowdonia) and Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority. These are considered to be &quot;local government&quot; by the Welsh Government.

The national park authorities&#x27; responsibilities are:

* conserving and enhancing the cultural heritage, local wildlife and natural beauty of their respective national parks.
* the promotion of opportunities that allow for increased public enjoyment and understanding of the national parks&#x27; special qualities.

== Regional governance ==
There are various forms of strategic partnerships covering regions of Wales, which bring together members of various public services. These include members of the principal councils, national park authorities, fire authorities, health boards, and town and community councils. As well as Corporate Joint Committees.

===Corporate Joint Committees===
The Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 allowed for the formation of corporate joint committees (CJCs) made up of two or more principal areas. CJCs have powers relating to economic well-being, strategic planning and the development of regional transport policies. There are four CJCs, covering Mid Wales, North Wales, South East Wales, and South West Wales. These are considered to be &quot;local government&quot; by the Welsh Government.

The joint committee&#x27;s areas are conterminous with the partnership economic areas established by the same councils as part of city deals and growth deals, which they were later given the responsibility to oversee. City deals have been agreed for the Cardiff Capital Region and Swansea Bay City Region, which cover south-east and south-west Wales respectively, and growth deals have been agreed for Mid Wales (Growing Mid Wales) and North Wales (Ambition North Wales).

In Wales, there are various strategic partnerships comprising members of multiple public services, such as local authorities, health board, fire and rescue authorities, national park authorities, and town and community councils.

=== Other regional bodies ===
Other regional partnerships include regional economic boards (for city/growth deals or Ambition boards), Regional Partnership Boards, Adults&#x27; and Children&#x27;s Safeguarding Partnerships, Community Safety Partnerships, Public Service Boards, Regional Housing Support Collaborative Groups and Area Planning Boards (relating to substance misuse).

==== Public Service Boards ====
A public service board (PSB) is a statutory board established in each principal area, as part of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. However, some PSB have merged to span multiple principal areas. Their main purpose is to improve the collaboration across the public services in a principal area.

There are four members of each board that are required by law, being members from the local authority, local health board, Natural Resources Wales and the fire and rescue authority. The board can statutory invite other public representatives such as the Police and crime commissioner, a force&#x27;s chief constable, probation services or a voluntary sector representative.

There are currently fifteen public service boards, of varying overlapping degrees of integration, in Wales, they are:

* Gwent PSB (merged PSB; of also the following individual PSBs)
** Blaenau Gwent PSB
** Caerphilly PSB
** Monmouthshire PSB
** Newport PSB
** Torfaen PSB
* Cwm Taf PSB
** Rhondda Cynon Taf PSB
** Merthyr Tydfil PSB
* Conwy and Denbighshire PSB
** Conwy PSB
** Denbighshire PSB
* Anglesey and Gwynedd (PSB collaboration on well-being plans)
** Anglesey PSB
** Gwynedd PSB

=== Regional Partnership Boards ===
Regional Partnership Boards (RPBs) were established by the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. They are made up of members of health boards, local authorities and the third sector. This can include a member of the local health board, a carer, a member of the public, a registered social landlord, a third-sector worker for a local authority or health board, and members of the local authority, such as one elected member, the Director of Social Services, a housing representative and an education representative. Their responsibilities are to produce regional population assessments and a regional area plan, provide a regional annual report and demonstrate how citizens have engaged and co-produced in the plans.

There are seven RPBs:

* Cardiff and Vale RPB
* Cwm Taf Morgannwg RPB
* Gwent RPB
* West Wales RPB
* North Wales RPB
* West Glamorgan RPB
* Powys RPB

===Trunk road agents===

Trunk road agents are partnerships between two or more local authorities for the purposes of managing, maintaining, and improving the network of trunk roads (including any motorways) in their respective areas. Each trunk road agent can employ Welsh Government traffic officers. There are two agents, covering North and Mid Wales and South Wales.

== Collaborative bodies ==
=== Partnership Council for Wales ===
The Partnership Council for Wales (PCfW), (), was established under the Government of Wales Act 2006 (section 72) and encourages co-operation between the Welsh Government and local governments. The council&#x27;s membership includes Welsh Government cabinet members, such as the first minister, and local government leaders, such as the leaders of principal, community, and town councils, and other public service representatives. Their meetings have representatives from organisations such as Wales TUC, Wales Council for Voluntary Action and other partners, as observers, like the Auditor General for Wales. The PCfW is responsible to encourage collaboration and dialogue on local government matters, and provide collective political accountability than can improve the outcomes for citizens.

=== Other ===

* Independent Remuneration Panel for Wales – Decide level of remuneration for elected local government representatives, such as councils, fire authorities and national park authorities.
* Democracy and Boundary Commission Cymru – Responsible for the amount of electoral wards in each principal area, and the amount of councillors which are to represent each ward.

==History==

Modern local government in Wales emerged during the late 19th century, when administrative counties and county boroughs were established in 1889. Urban and rural districts were formed in 1894. These were replaced in 1974 by eight two-tier counties and thirty-seven districts, which were in turn replaced by the present principal areas in 1996.

In April 2013, it was announced that a major review was to be undertaken into local government organisation in Wales, with a Commission on Public Service Governance and Delivery being established, to be chaired by Sir Paul Williams. First Minister Carwyn Jones said: &quot;Since public sector budgets are likely to continue to tighten, and demand pressures grow, there is a clear need to examine how services can be sustained and standards of performance raised, so that people in Wales can continue to receive and influence the public services they need and value.&quot;

The Commission reported on 20 January 2014. It recommended that the number of councils be reduced, through mergers rather than through boundary changes, from 22 to 10, 11 or 12; and suggested that the cost of merging the councils would be met through savings made within about two years.

Carwyn Jones, first minister of Wales, stated that the report &quot;addresses many [of the] issues [...] [as] the need for public services is outstripping the resources available to provide them&quot;, and that he&#x27;s &quot;always been clear that the status quo is not an option&quot; and that change is essential and has to be done &quot;so that our public services can become more efficient, effective, accessible and responsive&quot;.

Janet Finch-Saunders AM, shadow minister for local government, said &quot;What matters to the vast majority of hardworking families is not the intricate structures of local government, but knowing that services will be delivered in an efficient and cost effective way [...] We believe that public services are best delivered locally so taxpayers can hold local representatives to account&quot;.

Rhodri Glyn Thomas, for Plaid Cymru, commented that evidence provided to the Williams Commission &quot;show[ed] that if the people of Wales are going to get the services they need and deserve then there has to be a radical improvement in [delivery of] public services&quot;.

====Draft Local Government (Wales) Bill====
In response to recommendations made by the Williams Commission, the Welsh Government published a draft local government bill in November 2015. The draft bill contained two proposals, one for eight local authorities and one for nine local authorities. The difference between the two proposals is related to North Wales (two or three local authorities). The bill did not propose names for the local authorities, only listing them by number as a combination of existing principal areas. Powys was not affected by either proposal. The changes were planned to take effect in April 2020.

=====Eight local authorities model=====

=====Nine local authorities model=====

====2016 redrafting and abandonment====
Following the 2016 assembly elections, Carwyn Jones, first minister of Wales, announced that the proposals for local government reform would be taken &quot;back to the drawing board&quot; and that a new consensus on how to reform local government in Wales would be sought. The merger plans were formally dropped in January 2017, when the Welsh Government instead began a consultation on wider reform of local governance arrangements. The number of councils are to remain as they currently are, unless two or more local authorities wish to pursue a voluntary merger.

====2017 white paper====
A white paper titled &quot;Reforming Local Government: Resilient and Renewed&quot; was published in January 2017. It proposed the formation of regional bodies to encourage better collaboration between existing local authorities and a possible change in the electoral system used in local elections from &quot;first past the post&quot; to the &quot;Single transferable vote&quot; system.

====2018 green paper====
A new green paper, &quot;Strengthening Local Government: Delivering for People&quot;, was published in 2018. The paper makes the case for a reduction of the number of local authorities from 22 to 10 and suggested three possible approaches, a system of voluntary mergers, a phased approach with authorities merging in either 2022 or 2026 or a comprehensive system of mergers to occur in 2022.


====Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021====
A bill was introduced by the Welsh Government in November 2019 to reform local government in Wales. The bill contains provisions to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 for local elections in Wales and will extend the franchise to include eligible foreign nationals. It extends the term of local councillors from four years to five years. The bill will allow local councils to decide to continue to hold elections under first past the post system or to switch to the single transferable vote system. The bill does not include provisions to restructure local councils but does contain mechanisms that can allow for two or more authorities to merge on a voluntary basis. It also creates a framework for joint regional coordination between local authorities through the formation of &quot;Corporate Joint Committees&quot;. The bill received Royal Assent in January 2021 and four Corporate Joint Committees covering all of Wales, were established the following month by statutory instruments.

== Mayors ==
There are some mayors in Wales, however they largely do not hold a governing role.

=== Directly-elected mayors ===
Principal councils in Wales can consider introducing a directly-elected mayor, like those in England. However, no Welsh council has introduced the role, with Ceredigion voters rejecting the idea in a 2004 referendum. For a council to adopt the model, either the public in the local authority&#x27;s area must start a petition, which then must pass a threshold to trigger a local referendum, or the council announces it wishes to adopt such a system, but must call a referendum to approve such system. If such a referendum passes in favour of a directly-elected mayor, then a subsequent election is held to elect such mayor, who would then create a cabinet in the council. A directly-elected mayor is an additional member to the existing number of councillors usually elected in local elections.

<doc id="222055" wikidata="Q852919" url="?curid=222055" title="Roots (Sepultura album)">
<text>Roots is the sixth studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura. It was released in Europe on and in the U.S. three weeks later on March 12 by Roadrunner Records. It is the band&#x27;s last studio album to feature founding member and vocalist/rhythm guitarist Max Cavalera, who left the band in late 1996 while the band was on tour to promote the album.

Following the shift to slower tempos and Latin-tinged rhythms on the album &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;, &quot;Roots&quot; delves even further into Brazilian musical textures and features significant contributions from iconic Brazilian musician Carlinhos Brown, who guided and arranged the sections throughout the album that feature ensemble percussion playing. Both in sound and overall aesthetic, &quot;Roots&quot; is also a conscious nod to Brazil&#x27;s marginalized indigenous population and cultures. The song &quot;Itsári&quot; features a Xavante chant that re-appears on the song &quot;Born Stubborn&quot; and serves as a loose thematic thread for the whole album, which on the whole showcases the band&#x27;s increased affinity for experimentation and collaboration.

&quot;Lookaway&quot; features guest appearances by Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis, then-Korn drummer David Silveria, House of Pain/Limp Bizkit turntablist DJ Lethal, and Faith No More/Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton. Riff-wise, &quot;Roots&quot; also draws influence from the then-surging nu metal movement, specifically Korn (whose first two albums were also produced by &quot;Roots&quot; producer Ross Robinson) and Deftones. After leaving the band, Max Cavalera would continue to pursue the nu metal and &quot;world&quot; stylings of &quot;Roots&quot; with his solo project Soulfly.

Since its release, &quot;Roots&quot; has received critical acclaim as a seminal work in Sepultura&#x27;s discography. It has also proven commercially successful; it has sold over two million copies worldwide, and remains Sepultura&#x27;s highest-charting album, peaking at 27 on the Billboard 200.

==Initial inspiration and recording==
&quot;Roots&quot; is the product of a concerted effort on the band&#x27;s part to embrace its Brazilian heritage. On many levels, the album reflects Sepultura&#x27;s heightened focus on the music, culture, and politics of their native country. The overarching concept for the album was inspired by the film &quot;At Play in the Fields of the Lord&quot; (particularly the scene in which Tom Berenger&#x27;s character parachutes onto a tribe). The movie inspired Max Cavalera to want to record with an indigenous Brazilian tribe. After convincing Roadrunner Records to support the project, Cavalera contacted Angela Pappiani, at the time the communications coordinator for Brazil&#x27;s Núcleo de Cultura Indígena (Indigenous Culture Center). Nearly one year after Cavalera&#x27;s initial contact with Roadrunner, Pappiani arranged for a small party including band, herself, Robinson, and then-manager Gloria Cavalera to travel to Mato Grosso, Brazil to visit the Xavante tribe and record with them. At the time, the members of Sepultura were only peripherally aware of the indigenous tribes residing in Brazil&#x27;s interior.

In a 2016 interview with &quot;Nashville Scene&quot;, Igor Cavalera remembered:

Every second of that trip was insane in a very inspiring way. But there&#x27;s a few things that really stand out. Like when they explained to us that the only way they wrote music was if someone in the tribe dreamed of the music. They couldn&#x27;t just write a lyric or a melody. It has to be transmitted to them in a dream. From a musician&#x27;s point of view, it was like, &quot;Wow, this is a completely different way of approaching music.&quot;University of Iowa anthropology professor Laura Graham explained the role of music in Xavante culture to &quot;PopMatters&quot; in 2016:

For them, music functions as a medium for entering into other realms—whether they be other dimensions of existence or other cultures. Well before they had any contact with white people, part of their culture has always entailed that men engage the spirit world, especially through music. This happens in their dreams. Not all, but most of their music is inspired—you could say &quot;composed&quot;, although they say &quot;received&quot;—in their dreams through encounters with other worlds. When people come and visit the community from the outside, one of the things the Xavante ask them to do is sing them a song. Music is this medium for entering into relations with others—others meaning spiritual beings or, for example, white society or other cultures. The Xavante want to be known and they want their culture to be known. They want their music to be known because they think it&#x27;s beautiful and view it as a contribution to humanity. It&#x27;s like, &quot;We have something beautiful to contribute to humanity—and, by the way, here we are suffering. We want people to know who we are and that we exist.&quot; And so when they got this proposal from a musical group that wanted to come jam and share music with them, they loved it.

A spokesman for the tribe looked back on the collaboration: &quot;We had seen pictures of Sepultura and we knew that they were different, with their long hair and many tattoos. We also knew that they had been discriminated, like we were. Because of that we were very curious about them.&quot;

Meeting the Xavante was by several accounts a life-changing experience that has continued to resonate with the members of Sepultura ever since. Igor has also said that the band identified a lot with the natives: &quot;In a certain way, I think that we, as a band, had a lot of things in common with the Xavante Indians. We also lived on the edge of society, and our music and lifestyle is a long way from being assimilated and respected by that society.&quot;

After the trip, recording resumed with Robinson at Indigo Ranch, at the time Robinson&#x27;s studio of choice. According to the same 2016 &quot;Nashville Scene&quot; article, by that point the band had amassed &quot;an overabundance of material.&quot; Igor Cavalera remembered that it was a challenge to prevent the album from becoming &quot;a gigantic jam that didn&#x27;t turn into actual songs.&quot; He added: &quot;It was quite a difficult record to finish. We did so much recording that the amount of stuff we had going on was quite crazy. We had to make sure not to let anything really special slip by. It was tricky to go through all of it, and it took a lot of time to find out what would work with what we were already writing.&quot;

According to Korn guitarist Brian Welch, in a November 1996 interview, his &quot;own Bigger Muff guitar pedal&quot; that he had initially modified and then used for his band was reused to his &quot;great dismay&quot; for recording the &quot;Roots&quot; album.

== Musical style ==
&quot;Roots&quot; represents a significant shift in direction for Sepultura. On several levels, the album reflects a concerted effort on the band&#x27;s part to embrace its Brazilian heritage, with a heightened focus on Brazilian culture that is strikingly apparent in the music. Musically speaking, the inspiration for the shift was twofold: One was the desire to further experiment with both Latin and indigenous strains of the music of Brazil, including the percussive style of the Salvador, Bahia samba reggae group Olodum. &quot;Roots&quot; was also inspired by Korn&#x27;s self-titled debut, with its heavily down-tuned guitars.

&quot;Roots&quot; is a groove metal and nu metal album that incorporates strong elements of aforementioned nu metal, thrash metal, death metal, world music, various Brazilian musical styles (including Brazilian folk music), tribal music, and ambient field recordings. All of the songs on &quot;Roots&quot; draw from these styles, with the band often blending them in unconventional ways and at times super-imposing them onto one another through creative mixing and editing in post-production. Several songs feature Brazilian instrumentation that had up to that point never been used by a metal band (certainly not one of Sepultura&#x27;s stature), and the album is peppered with ensemble percussion sections played by the band along with Carlinhos Brown.

Of the album&#x27;s prominent Latin influence, Igor Cavalera told &quot;Nashville Scene&quot;:

I&#x27;d always wanted to do a little more stuff with a Latin feel, but it took until &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; to realize how we could make that into something that wasn&#x27;t too clichéd. That was always my fear. I&#x27;d been exposed to samba and the African Brazilian rhythms before I played the drums, and I&#x27;d always had a lot of caution about incorporating them in the right way, and not doing it for the sake of just having them there. It took us a lot of research and time to make sure that we did it in a way that felt completely natural. It wasn&#x27;t just like &quot;OK, we like this and it makes sense, so let&#x27;s just do it.&quot; It took a lot to develop.

== Lyrical and visual themes ==
Disparate elements of Brazilian culture permeate every aspect of &quot;Roots&quot;, from the music to the lyrics to the artwork and visuals to the videos the band made for the songs &quot;Roots Bloody Roots,&quot; &quot;Attitude,&quot; and &quot;Ratamahatta.&quot; The album cover features an indigenous man of the Karajá tribe taken from a 1990 banknote of the discontinued Brazilian cruzeiro, to which artist Michael Whelan added a locket with Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;tribal S&quot; logo and a background of red roots.

Much of &quot;Roots&quot; references Brazilian culture, history, lore, and politics, either directly or indirectly. According to Max Cavalera, &quot;Roots Bloody Roots&quot; is &quot;about believe in yourself, about be proud of your heritage, proud of where you come from. Really powerful but simple lyrics. So it&#x27;s really about just be down with your own roots and believe in your roots&quot;. (In a 1996 MTV Europe clip, Max Cavalera explained the meaning behind the song as: &quot;Don&#x27;t give in. What you believe is for life, even if people try all the time to change you. The song is about &#x27;don&#x27;t let the bastards grind you down.)

&quot;Ratamahatta&quot; is &quot;a celebration of life in Brazil&#x27;s &quot;favela&quot; slums, sung all in Portuguese, which tells the stories of people like Zé do Caixão (Coffin Joe) and Lampião, the leader of an early 1900s outlaw gang from north Brazil, whose head was put on public display after he was captured&quot;. &quot;Ambush&quot; is &quot;a tribute to murdered South American rain-forest activist Chico Mendes&quot;. &quot;Dictatorshit&quot; addresses the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état. &quot;Endangered Species&quot; addresses environmental destruction.

&quot;Cut-Throat&quot; is about Epic Records. (The last words in the song are &quot;Enslavement, Pathetic, Ignorant, Corporations&quot;. This spells EPIC, the record company with which Sepultura had some trouble during their previous album, &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;)

The lyrics to &quot;Attitude&quot; were co-written by Dana Wells, Max Cavalera&#x27;s stepson, whose death (in part) led to the events which caused Max to leave the band. Dana also came up with the concept for the video for the song, featuring Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu experts the Gracie family.

==Critical reception==
American newspapers like &quot;The New Times&quot;, the &quot;Daily News&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewed the Brazilian band: &quot;The mixture of the dense metal of Sepultura and the Brazilian music has a intoxicating effect&quot;, wrote a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer. &quot;The Daily News&quot; praised the album saying: &quot;Sepultura reinvented the wheel. By mixing metal with native instruments, the band resuscitates the tired genre, reminding of Led Zeppelin times. But while Zeppelin mixed English metal with African beats, it&#x27;s still more moving to hear a band that uses elements of its own country. By extracting the sounds of the past, Sepultura determines the future direction of metal&quot;.

Specialized heavy metal critics also reviewed the album positively. Martin Popoff, author of the book &quot;The Collector&#x27;s Guide to Heavy Metal&quot;, ranked &quot;Roots&quot; as the 11th best metal record of all time. &quot;This is a spectacular metal and futurist hardcore LP&quot;, wrote Popoff, &quot;a masterpiece, accomplished by a band with an enormous heart and an even larger intellect&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine awarded &quot;Roots&quot; second place in the list of &quot;100 records that you have to hear before dying&quot;. In 2001 &quot;Q&quot; magazine named &quot;Roots&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone Brasil&quot; named it the 57th best Brazilian music album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contributor Jon Wiederhorn gave the album three stars out of five and said, &quot;Sepultura play a violent game of sonic overload... the band uses its catharsis as a creative force, funneling torrents of noise into a tunnel of hate&quot; and called the album &quot;a refreshing step forward in a genre full of bands that are creatively bankrupt.&quot; Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a negative &quot;dud&quot; rating. Looking back on the album 20 years later, &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Saby Reyes-Kulkarni described &quot;Roots&quot; as &quot;inarguably one of the most radical [stylistic] departures from convention in heavy metal history,&quot; an album that &quot;blew the doors open on our perceptions of metal and so-called &#x27;world music,&#x27;&quot; adding that &quot;we haven&#x27;t heard anything quite like it since.&quot; In April 2005, Decibel inducted &quot;Roots&quot; into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame, becoming the third album overall to receive a coveted spot in their Hall of Fame.

== Legacy ==
Since the release of &quot;Roots&quot;, there have been cases where other metal bands who are not of Western (i.e.: European or American) origin have combined metal with music from their own native regions, though none of those bands have reached the same level of visibility or commercial success that Sepultura achieved with &quot;Roots&quot;. Chthonic, for example, blend symphonic death metal with traditional Taiwanese music and mythology; Melechesh play black metal while drawing from Assyrian/Babylonian/Middle Eastern mythology and symbology; Tengger Cavalry combine metal with Mongolian throat singing and classical Chinese instrumentation in both electric and acoustic settings; Alien Weaponry play thrash and groove metal with Māori lyrics, often with Māori cultural and historical themes.

Speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 2008, Max Cavalera looked back on Roots:

&quot;Roots&quot; came from a blurry dream I had about going to the rainforest. Wine may have been involved. In the end, when we actually went into the forest to record, it was unbelievable. The whole album was a huge personal journey for me, and as a Brazilian, it felt as an incredible achievement. Everyone was inspired and Igor was at the top of his game. The percussion was crazy and we worked with so many great musicians, in the end coming out with a 15-minutes drum jam that someone likened to a crazy Brazilian Pink Floyd. When we took the album to Roadrunner they loved it except for the title. They thought it would sound like a Bob Marley tribute album. We explained it to them, and thankfully they got it.

As for the Xavantes, both their leader at the time of the band&#x27;s visit (Cipassé) and Pappiani agree that &quot;Roots&quot; helped the tribe gain some visibility, to the point that people would actually identify them as Xavantes instead of just calling them &quot;indigenous people&quot;. Pappiani noticed an increase in people&#x27;s interest for information on the tribe and their music.

On March 25, 2021, French heavy metal band Gojira released the single &quot;Amazonia&quot;, a song about anti-deforestation of the Amazon and the protection of Brazilian indigenous peoples&#x27; rights. Shortly after its release on April 15, frontman Joe Duplantier in an interview with Blabbermouth.net was asked his thoughts about comparing &quot;Amazonia&quot; to Sepultura, to which he said:

I go, &quot;Yup.&quot; And it&#x27;s a compliment, and there is no shame here. And we ripped them off, but we didn&#x27;t do it on purpose. But we realized it right after. We were, like, &quot;Oh, that sounds like SEPULTURA. Ahhh, whatever.&quot; It&#x27;s a tribute to Sepultura — how about that? It&#x27;s about Brazil. It&#x27;s about the Amazon. It&#x27;s tribal.

Brazilian UFC fighter Alex Pereira uses the song &#x27;Itsári&#x27; as his signature walkout music before his fights.

<doc id="222059" wikidata="Q717478" url="?curid=222059" title="Administrative geography of the United Kingdom">
<text>The administrative geography of the United Kingdom is complex, multi-layered and non-uniform. The United Kingdom, a sovereign state to the northwest of continental Europe, consists of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. For local government in the United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each have their own system of administrative and geographic demarcation. Consequently, there is &quot;no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom&quot;.

Because there is no written document that comprehensively encompasses the British constitution, and owing to a convoluted history of the formation of the United Kingdom, a variety of terms are used to refer to its constituent parts, which are sometimes called the four countries of the United Kingdom. The four are sometimes collectively referred to as the Home Nations, particularly in sporting contexts. Although the four countries are important for legal and governmental purposes, they are not comparable to administrative subdivisions of most other countries.

The United Kingdom also contains 17 dependent territories which are not officially a part of the UK but are represented by it in places like the UN.

Historically, the subnational divisions of the UK have been the county and the ecclesiastical parish, while following the emergence of a unified parliament of the United Kingdom, the ward and constituency have been pan-UK political subdivisions. More contemporary divisions include Lieutenancy areas and the statistical territories defined with the modern ITL (formerly NUTS) and ISO 3166-2:GB systems.

==History==
This structure was formed by the union agreed between the former sovereign states, the Kingdom of England (including the Principality of Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland in the Treaty of Union and enacted by the &quot;Acts of Union 1707&quot; to form the single Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1800); followed by the &quot;Act of Union 1800&quot;, which combined Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, following the partition of Ireland, resulted in the present-day United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Wales was incorporated into the English legal system through the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542, the earlier Statute of Rhuddlan having restricted but not abolished Welsh Law following the Edwardian conquest in 1282. As a result, England and Wales are treated as a single entity for some purposes, principally that they share a legal system (see English law), while Scotland and Northern Ireland each have a separate legal system (see Scots Law and Northern Ireland law).

Northern Ireland was the first part of the British Isles to have a devolved government, under the &quot;Government of Ireland Act 1920&quot;, and that continued until the Parliament of Northern Ireland was suspended in 1972. After a period of direct rule by the Westminster government and some abortive attempts at reinstating devolved government during the Troubles, the present-day Northern Ireland Assembly was established in 1998, and is currently in operation following a number of periods of suspension. The complex history of Northern Ireland has led to differing views as to its status. The term &quot;Province&quot; is often used by unionist and British commentators to refer to Northern Ireland, but not by nationalists.

==Overview of administration==

Following Brexit the UK ONS replaced the EU NUTS1 regional model with its own International Territorial Level model, continuing the treatment of the 3 Home Nations alongside the 9 Regions of England.

: Can have city, borough or royal borough status
: Has a council
: Has a legislature
: May have a council
: &quot;Sui generis&quot; unitary authority. Not a county nor part of Cornwall. Powers similar to a mainland county.
: Can have city, town, village or neighbourhood status. Not all areas of England have parishes, especially metropolitan areas.
: County council areas comprising one district. The council is at either county or district level.
: Limited administrative functions
: No administrative functions

==Systems of government==
=== England ===

#England has no devolved national legislature or government.
#Varied upper administration levels
##Combined authorities
##County councils
##Greater London Authority
#Districts (all of England) can be called cities, boroughs or royal boroughs. Separate legislation exists for:
##unitary authorities
##non-metropolitan districts
##metropolitan boroughs
##London boroughs
##sui generis status (the City of London and Isle of Scilly).
#civil parishes with parish or town councils, most of England but not as common in larger urban areas.

=== Northern Ireland===
Northern Ireland has the Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive established under the Good Friday Agreement. During periods where the devolved institutions were suspended, executive government in Northern Ireland was administered directly by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and laws made in the United Kingdom Parliament – known as &quot;direct rule&quot; in contrast to devolution.

For local government, Northern Ireland is divided into 11 districts, which are unitary authorities.

Northern Ireland is divided into six traditional counties. Though widely used, these no longer serve any administrative purpose.

===Scotland ===
Scotland has a devolved legislature, the Scottish Parliament, with a government, the Scottish Government, since 1999. The Scottish Government is headed by the First Minister of Scotland who is responsible for all areas of decision making, government policy as well as the international engagement of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament is made up of 129 elected Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), with the population of Scotland being represented by a number of 8 MSPs. The Scottish Parliament consists of two types of MSPs – a constituency MSP who represents the local area, and seven regional list MSPs who collectively represent the larger area that includes any given constituency.

The Scottish Parliament meets at Holyrood, located in the capital city of Edinburgh. Edinburgh is also the seat of Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister, as well as the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the monarch in Scotland. The highest courts in Scotland operating under the countries legal system – the High Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session (known collectively as the Supreme Courts of Scotland) – are based at Parliament House, Edinburgh.

For local government, Scotland has 32 council areas (unitary authorities). Below this uniform level of subdivision, there are varying levels of area committees in the larger rural council areas, and many small community councils throughout the country, although these are not universal. Scottish community councils have few if any powers beyond being a forum for raising issues of concern.

===Wales ===
Wales has an elected, devolved legislature, the Senedd (Welsh Parliament; ), from which the Welsh Government is drawn.
For local government, Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities: 10 county boroughs, 9 Counties, and 3 Cities. Below these are community councils, which have powers similar to those of English parish councils.

The 22 unitary authorities are grouped into preserved counties, which are used for ceremonial purposes. Although based on the counties used for local government between 1974 and 1996, they no longer have an administrative function.

==Democratic representation==
===Parliaments===

Each of the 650 electoral areas or divisions called constituencies of the Parliament of the United Kingdom has, since 1950, elected one Member of Parliament (MP) to represent it at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Before 1950, some constituencies elected two or more MPs using the plurality bloc vote system, and before the Reform Act 1832 nearly all constituencies in England returned two MPs.

The devolved Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Senedd both use an additional member system of elections, which combines single-member constituencies with multi-member electoral regions.

Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are held under the single transferable vote (STV) system, in 18 multi-member constituencies.

===Local government===
The wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom are electoral districts at subnational level represented by one or more councillors at local authority level, or else used to divide the electorate into electoral districts for voting. It is the primary unit of British electoral geography.

==Informal divisions==

There are also many informal, historical and special purpose regional designations. Some such as the Highlands of Scotland have or have had, to some extent, formal boundaries. Others such as the London commuter belt are more diffuse. Some such as Snowdonia (&quot;Eryri&quot;) have a formal boundary in some contexts; in this case as a National Park. Others such as The Fens of eastern England are quite distinctly defined by geography but do not form any official entity.

==International subdivisions==
The UK&#x27;s Office for National Statistics, the International Organization for Standardization and before 2021 Eurostat, have developed subdivision codes for the UK. See ITL (UK) and ISO 3166-2:GB.

==Dependent territories==

The United Kingdom has 17 dependent territories in total: three &quot;Crown Dependencies&quot; in the British Isles and in the English Channel and fourteen &quot;overseas territories&quot; scattered around the world.

Unlike other former colonial powers, the British Government does not classify its overseas possessions (or the crown dependencies, which share historical ties with the British Crown) as subdivisions of the United Kingdom itself; rather, each is treated in law as a separate jurisdiction. Most have their own legislatures and a degree of autonomy usually exceeding that of the devolved UK nations, including fiscal independence.

Out of the 14 overseas territories, 10 are autonomous, two used primarily as military bases, one uninhabited, and one an Antarctic claim.

However, the UK retains varying degrees of responsibility in all of the territories, currently ranging from full political control to a largely ceremonial presence. The main reserved matters are the areas of diplomacy, international treaties, defence and security. The UK also retains in all territories a residual responsibility for &#x27;good governance&#x27;, a loosely defined constitutional concept recently exemplified by its imposition of direct rule following alleged serious corruption in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The UK parliament at Westminster, and the British Government through the Privy Council, both retain the power to legislate for the overseas territories – though by convention will usually only do so with each local government&#x27;s consent.

The three Crown Dependencies within the British Isles are self-governing possessions of the British Crown. They are distinct from the British overseas territories of the United Kingdom.

<text>The empty tomb is the Christian tradition that the tomb of Jesus was found empty after his crucifixion. The canonical gospels each describe the visit of women to Jesus&#x27; tomb. Although Jesus&#x27; body had been laid out in the tomb after crucifixion and death, the tomb is found to be empty, the body gone, and the women are told by angels (or a &quot;young man [...] dressed in a white robe&quot;) that he has risen.

==Gospel accounts==

===Overview===
Although the four canonical gospels detail the narrative, oral traditions existed well before the composition of the gospels on the matter. The four gospels were almost certainly not by eyewitnesses, at least in their final forms, but were instead the end-products of long oral and written transmission. Three of the four (Mark, Luke, and Matthew) are called the synoptics (meaning &quot;seeing together&quot;), because they present very similar stories, and it is generally agreed that this is because two of them, Matthew and Luke, have used Mark as their source. The earliest of them, Mark, dates probably from around AD 65–70, some forty years after the death of Jesus, while Matthew and Luke date from around AD 85–90. John, the last gospel to be completed, began circulating between 90 and 110, and its narrative of the empty tomb is not merely a different form of the story told in the synoptics, but after differs to such an extent that it cannot be harmonised with the earlier three.

In the original ending of the Gospel of Mark, the oldest, three women visit the tomb to anoint the body of Jesus, but find instead a &quot;young man [...] dressed in a white robe&quot; who tells them that Jesus will meet the disciples in Galilee. The women then flee, telling no one. Matthew introduces guards and a doublet where the women are told twice, by angels and then by Jesus, that he will meet the disciples in Galilee. Luke changes Mark&#x27;s one &quot;young man [...] dressed in a white robe&quot; to two, adds Peter&#x27;s inspection of the tomb, and deletes the promise that Jesus would meet his disciples in Galilee. John reduces the women to the solitary Mary Magdalene, and introduces the &quot;beloved disciple&quot; who visits the empty tomb with Peter and is the first to understand its significance.

===The synoptics===
 probably represents a complete unit of oral tradition taken over by the author. It concludes with the women fleeing from the empty tomb and telling no one what they have seen, and the general scholarly view is that this was the original ending of this gospel, with the remaining verses, , being added later. The imagery of a young man in a white robe, and the reaction of the women, indicates that this is an encounter with an angel. The empty tomb fills the women with fear and alarm, not with faith in the risen Lord, although the mention of a meeting in Galilee is evidence of some sort of previous, pre-Markan, tradition linking Galilee and the resurrection.

Matthew revises Mark&#x27;s account to make it more convincing and coherent. The description of the angel is taken from Daniel&#x27;s angel with a face &quot;like the appearance of lightning&quot; () and his God with &quot;raiment white as snow&quot; (), and Daniel also provides the reaction of the guards (). The introduction of the guard is apparently aimed at countering stories that Jesus&#x27; body had been stolen by his disciples, thus eliminating any explanation of the empty tomb other than that offered by the angel, that he has been raised. Matthew introduces a doublet whereby the women are told twice, by the angels and then by Jesus, that he will meet the disciples in Galilee ()—the reasons for this are unknown.

Luke changes Mark&#x27;s one &quot;young man [...] dressed in a white robe&quot; to two, makes reference to earlier passion predictions (), and adds Peter&#x27;s inspection of the tomb. He also deletes the promise that Jesus would meet his disciples in Galilee. In Mark and Matthew, Jesus tells the disciples to meet him there, but in Luke the post-resurrection appearances are only in Jerusalem. Mark and Luke report that the women visited the tomb in order to finish anointing the body of Jesus. While Mark doesn&#x27;t provide any explanation why they couldn&#x27;t complete their task on the evening of the crucifixion, Luke explains that the first sundown of sabbath had already begun when Jesus was being buried, and that the women were observant of sabbath regulations. In Matthew the women came simply to see the tomb, and in John no reason is given. John reduces the women to the solitary Mary Magdalene, which is consistent with . The story ends with Peter visiting the tomb and seeing the burial cloths, but instead of believing in the resurrection he remains perplexed.

The following table, with translations from the New International Version, allows the three versions to be compared. (, in which Peter goes to the tomb, may be an addition to the original gospel taken from John&#x27;s version of the narrative).

===John===
John&#x27;s chapter 20 can be divided into three scenes: (1) the discovery of the empty tomb, verses 1–10; (2) appearance of Jesus to Mary Magdalene, 11–18; and (3) appearances to the disciples, especially Thomas, verses 19–29; the last is not part of the &quot;empty tomb&quot; episode and is not included in the following table. He introduces the &quot;beloved disciple&quot;, who visits the tomb with Peter and understands its significance before Peter. The author seems to have combined three traditions, one involving a visit to the tomb by several women early in the morning (of which the &quot;we&quot; in &quot;we do not know where they have taken him&quot; is a fragmentary remnant), a second involving a visit to the empty tomb by Peter and perhaps by other male disciples, and a third involving an appearance of Jesus to Mary Magdalene. John has reduced this to the solitary Mary Magdalene in order to introduce the conversation between her and Jesus, but the presence of &quot;we&quot; when she informs the disciples may be a remnant of the original group of women, since mourning and the preparation of bodies by anointing were social rather than solitary activities.

==Origins==
===Cultural and religious context===
Although Jews, Greeks, and Romans all believed in the reality of resurrection, they differed in their respective conceptions and interpretations of it. Christians certainly knew of numerous resurrection-events allegedly experienced by persons other than Jesus: the early 3rd-century Christian theologian Origen, for example, did not deny the resurrection of the 7th-century BCE semi-legendary Greek poet Aristeas or the immortality of the 2nd-century CE Greek youth Antinous, the beloved of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, but said the first had been the work of demons, not God, while the second, unlike Jesus, was unworthy of worship.

Mark Goodacre writes that using &quot;empty tomb&quot; to refer to the disappearance of Jesus&#x27; body may be a misnomer since first-century tombs in Judea were built to house multiple bodies. As such, Mark narrates that the women had seen the spot where Jesus was laid while the later gospels state that the tomb was &quot;new&quot; and unused.

===&quot;Assumption&quot; or &quot;translation&quot; stories===
The composition and classification of the empty tomb story have been the subject of considerable debate. Several scholars have argued that the empty tomb story in Mark is similar to &quot;assumption&quot; or &quot;translation&quot; stories, and not a resurrection story, in which certain special individuals are described as being transported into the divine realm (heaven) before or after their death. Adela Yarbro Collins, for example, explains the Markan narrative as a Markan deduction from an early Christian belief in the resurrection. She classifies it as a translation story, meaning a story of the removal of a newly-immortal hero to a non-Earthly realm. According to Daniel Smith, a missing body was far more likely to be interpreted as an instance of removal by a divine agent than as an instance of resurrection or resuscitation. Richard C. Miller compares the ending of Mark to Hellenistic and Roman translation stories of heroes which involve missing bodies.

However, Smith also notes that certain elements within Mark&#x27;s empty tomb story are inconsistent with an assumption narrative, most importantly the response to the women from the young man at the tomb: (&quot;He is risen&quot; ). Pointing to the existence in earlier Jewish texts both of the idea of resurrection from the grave and of that of a heavenly assumption of the resurrected, Dale Allison argues that resurrection and assumption are not mutually contradicting ideas, and that the empty tomb story probably involved both from the beginning.

===Skepticism about the empty tomb narrative===
Early on, the stories about the empty tomb were met with skepticism. The Gospel of Matthew already mentions stories that the body was stolen from the grave. Other suggestions, not supported in mainstream scholarship, are that Jesus had not really died on the cross, or was lost due to natural causes.

The absence of any reference to the story of Jesus&#x27; empty tomb in the Pauline epistles and the Easter kerygma (preaching or proclamation) of the earliest church, originating perhaps in the Christian community of Antioch in the 30s and preserved in 1 Corinthians, has led some scholars to suggest that Mark invented it. Allison, however, finds this argument from silence unconvincing. Other scholars have argued that instead, Paul presupposes the empty tomb, specifically in the early creed passed down in 1 Cor. 15.

Most scholars believe that John wrote independently of Mark and that the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John contain two independent attestations of an empty tomb, which in turn suggests that both used already-existing sources and appealed to a commonly held tradition, though Mark may have added to and adapted that tradition to fit his narrative. How and why Mark adapts his material is unclear. Smith believes that Mark has adapted two separate traditions of resurrection and disappearance into one Easter narrative.

===Empty tomb and resurrection appearances===
According to Rudolf Bultmann, &quot;Easter stories [...] fall into two groups – stories of the empty tomb and stories of the appearance of the risen Lord, though there are stories that combine them both (Mt 28:1–8, 9f; Jn 20:1, 11–18).&quot; N. T. Wright emphatically and extensively argues for the reality of the empty tomb and the subsequent appearances of Jesus, reasoning that as a matter of &quot;inference&quot; both a bodily resurrection and later bodily appearances of Jesus are far better explanations for the empty tomb and the &#x27;meetings&#x27; and the rise of Christianity than are any other theories, including those of Ehrman. Dale Allison has argued for an empty tomb, that was later followed by visions of Jesus by the Apostles and Mary Magdalene, while also accepting the historicity of the resurrection. Christian biblical scholars have used textual critical methods to support the historicity of the tradition that &quot;Mary of Magdala had indeed been the first to see Jesus,&quot; most notably the Criterion of Embarrassment in recent years. According to Dale Allison, the inclusion of women as the first witnesses to the risen Jesus &quot;once suspect, confirms the truth of the story.&quot;

According to Géza Vermes, the empty tomb developed independently from the post-resurrection appearances, as they are never directly coordinated to form a combined argument. While the coherence of the empty tomb narrative is questionable, it is &quot;clearly an early tradition&quot;. Vermes rejects the literal interpretation of the story, and also notes that the story of the empty tomb conflicts with notions of a spiritual resurrection. According to Vermes, &quot;[t]he strictly Jewish bond of spirit and body is better served by the idea of the empty tomb and is no doubt responsible for the introduction of the notions of palpability (Thomas in John) and eating (Luke and John).&quot; New Testament historian Bart D. Ehrman rejects the story of the empty tomb, and argues that &quot;an empty tomb had nothing to do with [believe in the resurrection] [...] an empty tomb would not produce faith&quot;. Ehrman argues that the empty tomb was needed to underscore the physical resurrection of Jesus.

<text>Wendy McElroy (born 1951) is a Canadian individualist feminist and voluntaryist writer. McElroy is the editor of the website ifeminists.net.

McElroy is the author of the book &quot;Rape Culture Hysteria&quot;, in which she contends that rape culture is a result of popular hysteria to the disadvantage of men, and in particular, white men.

In November 2014, McElroy was scheduled to debate Jessica Valenti at a Brown University Janus Forum debate on &quot;How Should Colleges Handle Sexual Assault?&quot;. Before the debate, Brown President Christina Paxson sent out a campus-wide e-mail saying she disagreed with McElroy&#x27;s views, and set up an alternative event at the same time to compete with the debate. The actions of Brown students and Paxson were criticized by various commentators.

<doc id="222066" wikidata="Q1123232" url="?curid=222066" title="Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards">
<text>During the 2003 invasion of Iraq by a United States–led coalition, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency developed a set of playing cards to help troops identify the most-wanted members of President Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government, mostly high-ranking members of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party or members of the Revolutionary Command Council; among them were some of Hussein&#x27;s family members. The cards were officially named the &quot;personality identification playing cards&quot;.

, all but four of the 52 most wanted have either died or been captured, eleven of whom have been released.

==About the cards==
Each card contains the wanted person&#x27;s address and, if available, the job performed by that individual. The highest-ranking cards, starting with the aces and kings, were used for the people at the top of the most-wanted list. The ace of spades is Saddam Hussein, the aces of clubs and hearts are his sons Qusay and Uday respectively, and the ace of diamonds is Saddam&#x27;s presidential secretary Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti. This strict correspondence to the order of the most-wanted list was not carried through the entire deck, but sometime later in 2003, the list itself was renumbered to conform (almost) to the deck of cards. The card backs feature camouflage reminiscent of that seen on the Desert Camouflage Uniform.

According to US Navy Lieutenant commander Jim Brooks, a spokesman for the Defense Intelligence Agency, such playing cards have been used as far back as the American Civil War and again in World War II—Army Air Corps decks printed with the silhouettes of German and Japanese fighter aircraft fetch hundreds of dollars today—and in the Korean War. Troops often play cards to pass the time, and seeing the names, faces and titles of the wanted Iraqis during their games will help soldiers and Marines in case they run into the wanted individuals in the field, Brooks said.

The list of &quot;Most Wanted&quot; was the result of a multi-intelligence agency collaboration which included the Defense Intelligence Agency, Central Command, and representatives from all US Service Branch Intelligence entities. The &quot;Most Wanted&quot; names were then assigned to their respective cards by five US Army soldiers, 2LT Hans Mumm, SSG Shawn Mahoney, SGT Andrei Salter, SGT Scott Boehmler, and SPC Joseph Barrios, who were assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency. The pictures used on the cards came from a number of intelligence agencies, but most were derived from &quot;open sources&quot;. The deck of cards was first announced publicly in Iraq on 11 April 2003, in a press conference by Army Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks, deputy director of operations at U.S. Central Command. On that same evening Max Hodges, a Houston-based entrepreneur, found and downloaded a high-resolution artwork file for the deck from a Defense Department web server. Discovering the following day that the file had vanished from the military web server he became the first eBay seller to offer the artwork file, in PDF, which could be used to reproduce the deck. He quickly contracted Gemaco Playing Card Company to print 1,000 decks for about $4,000 and started selling both the decks, in advance of receiving them from the printer, on eBay, Amazon.com and his own web site. When some of his early auctions for a $4 deck of cards quickly rose to over $120, it did not take long for other eBayers to jump on the bandwagon and print or order decks of their own to sell. In just a few days hundreds of sellers materialized and the price dropped to just a few dollars per deck.

The Texas-based Liberty Playing Card Company received an order to manufacture the cards for the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and by claiming to be &quot;the authorized government contractor&quot; quickly became another popular domestic supplier for the commercial market. The U.S. military inadvertently included in the jokers the trademarked Hoyle joker owned by the United States Playing Card Company of Cincinnati, Ohio.

==List of cards==

===Variants===
The cards also include two jokers: one lists Arab tribal titles, the other Iraqi military ranks. There are no cards for most-wanted No. 45 (was #26), Nayef Shindakh Thamir, No. 53 (was #34 – Killed in 2003 or possibly still fugitive) Hussein Al-Awadi, or No. 54 (was #35) Khamis Sirhan, captured on 11 January 2004. Al-Muhammad was held for six years before being released on 30 July 2010. He fled to Syria where other uncaptured members of the deck of cards were reported to be hiding.

The 13 June 2003 edition of the BBC One satirical news quiz, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, featured a set of the playing cards in one round, spoofing guest host Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s 1980s game show &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot; (the British version of the American series &quot;Card Sharks&quot;). The two teams played a version of the latter&#x27;s main game, retitled &quot;Play Your Iraqi Cards Right&quot; (although it was later revealed that the writers&#x27; first choice of title had been &quot;Play Your Kurds Right&quot;), with the same rules (and audience participation). Much of the humour of the round came from the reactions of the two team captains: while Paul Merton was clearly familiar with the game and greatly enjoyed it, his opponent, Ian Hislop, admitted he had never seen &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot; and appeared mystified by the game&#x27;s rules and etiquette (when at one point Merton and the crowd shouted the traditional cry of &quot;lower, lower,&quot; to predict the next card in the hidden sequence, Hislop commented, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure this programme could get much lower!&quot;).

<doc id="222068" wikidata="Q171634" url="?curid=222068" title="Subdivisions of England">
<text>The subdivisions of [[England]] constitute a hierarchy of administrative divisions and non-administrative ceremonial areas.

Overall, England is divided into nine regions and 48 ceremonial counties, although these have only a limited role in public policy. For the purposes of local government, the country is divided into counties, districts and parishes. In some areas, counties and districts form a two-tier administrative structure, while in others they are combined under a unitary authority. Parishes cover only part of England.

The current system is the result of incremental reform which has its origins in legislation enacted in 1965 and 1972.

== Administrative ==
England has a non-universal structure of local government subdivisions. There are two tiers of local government subdivision - (administrative) counties and districts (known as boroughs in London).

Different local divisions exist across England:
*Tier structure:
** County tier
** District tier
*Authority structure:
** Combined authority and Greater London Authority
** Unitary authority, Metropolitan borough and London borough
The authority structure is slowly replacing the tier structure and metropolitan boroughs with all the metropolitan boroughs in combined authorities and periodic abolitions of the tier structure councils into unitary authority councils.
===Tiers===
The 1974 reform of local government established the tier structure throughout England with county authorities in metropolitan and Greater London also existing, 1986 reform abolished these. From the 1996 reform the structure&#x27;s use has been declining, 21 tiered areas remain out of the original 48. The county tier provides the majority of services, including education and social services while the 164 district-tier councils have a more limited role.

=== Authorities ===
As of April 2023, there are 62 unitary authorities. Unitary authorities have control of their areas functioning. 
There is a general push towards the reorganisation of English local government to the authority structure, often reorganisation is a condition of new devolution powers. 46 unitary authorities were created from the 1996 reform, nine more were created in 2009, followed by further changes in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2023. The Greater London administrative area was created in 1965 with 32 boroughs, excluding the City of London. Six Metropolitan two-tiered areas were created in 1974, similar to the Greater London model. These county-tier councils had extra devolved powers to others. In 1986, the county-tier was abolished with the London boroughs, Metropolitan boroughs and combined boards remaining. Apart from status these boroughs have the same powers to unitary authorities.

Combined authorities operate the opposite way round to the county in a tier structure, the combined authority acts on what the unitary authorities have agreed upon to focus on and what powers have been given by central government. In 2000, the Greater London Authority was created with an elected Mayor of London and the London Assembly. In 2010, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority was created with a similar modal to the GLA a with further combined authorities based on the GMCA created. , 10 combined authorities and the Greater London Authority currently exist.

===Other===
==== &quot;Sui generis&quot; ====
The Isles of Scilly are governed by a &quot;sui generis&quot; local authority called the Council of the Isles of Scilly. The authority was established in 1890 as the Isles of Scilly Rural District Council. It was renamed but otherwise unreformed by the changes in local government that occurred in 1974 in the rest of England outside Greater London. Although effectively a unitary authority, for example it is an education authority, the Isles of Scilly are part of the Cornwall ceremonial county and combine with Cornwall Council for services such as health and economic development.

The ancient City of London forms a 33rd division and is governed by the City of London Corporation, a &quot;sui generis&quot; authority unlike any other in England that has largely avoided any of the reforms of local government in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
==== Civil parishes ====

The civil parish is the most local unit of government in England. A parish is governed by a parish council or parish meeting, which exercises a limited number of functions that would otherwise be delivered by the local authority. There is one civil parish in Greater London (Queen&#x27;s Park, in the City of Westminster), and not all of the rest of England is parished. The number of parishes and total area parished is growing.

==Non-administrative==
=== Regions ===

At the highest level, all of England is divided into nine regions that are each made up of a number of counties and districts. These &quot;government office regions&quot; were created in 1994, and from the 1999 Euro-elections up until the UK&#x27;s exit from the EU, they were used as the European Parliament constituencies in the United Kingdom and in England&#x27;s European Parliament constituencies.

The regions vary greatly in their areas covered, populations and contributions to the national economy. All have the same status, except London which has substantive devolved powers.

There was a failed attempt to create elected regional assemblies outside London in 2004 and since then the structures of regional governance (regional assemblies, regional development agencies and local authority leaders&#x27; boards) have been subject to review. Following the change of government in 2010, these were scheduled for abolition by 2012.

=== Ceremonial and historic counties ===

For non-administrative purposes, England is wholly divided into 48 ceremonial counties. These are used for the purposes of appointing Lords Lieutenant who are the Crown&#x27;s representatives in those areas as well as a way of grouping non-metropolitan counties. They are taken into consideration when drawing up Parliamentary constituency boundaries. Ceremonial counties are commonly named after historic counties, the ceremonial county acts as an in between for the administrative boundaries and long established areas used in fields such as sport.
=== Titles, non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties ===

County-tier councils and each unitary authority are separate non-metropolitan counties, each non-metropolitan county can be known as a district, city or borough. Berkshire is an anomaly in this arrangement whereby its districts became unitary authorities, the non-metropolitan county remain to keep the title of Royal county, in the same way the metropolitan county remained when the county-tier councils were abolished. Each correspond to an administrative body.

Non-metropolitan districts can also be a borough, city or district. Unitary authority areas are joint non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts.

<text>During presidential election campaigns in the United States, it has become customary for the candidates to engage in one or more debates. The topics discussed in the debate are often the most controversial issues of the time, and arguably elections have been nearly decided by these debates. Candidate debates are not constitutionally mandated, but they are now considered an intrinsic part of the election process. The debates are targeted mainly at undecided voters; those who tend not to be partial to any political ideology or party.

With the exception of the debate between 45th President Donald J. Trump and 46th President Joseph R. Biden Jr. held on June 27, 2024, presidential debates are typically held late in the election cycle, after the political parties have nominated their candidates. The candidates typically meet in a large hall, often at a university, and usually before an audience of citizens; however, to accommodate debate rules and guidelines requested by the Biden 2024 campaign for the June 27, 2024 debate between Trump and Biden, no audience of citizens was present. The formats of the debates have varied, with questions sometimes posed from one or more journalist moderators and in other cases members of the audience. The debate formats established during the 1988 through 2000 campaigns were governed in detail by secret memoranda of understanding (MOU) between the two major candidates; the MOU for the 2004 debates was, unlike the earlier agreements, jointly released to the public by the participants.

Debates have been broadcast live on television, radio, and in recent years, the web. The first debate for the 1960 election drew over 66 million viewers out of a population of 179 million, making it one of the most-watched broadcasts in U.S. television history. The 1980 debates drew 80 million viewers out of a population of 226 million. Recent debates have drawn smaller audiences, ranging from 46 million for the first 2000 debate to a high of over 67 million for the first debate in 2012. A record-breaking audience of over 84 million people watched the first 2016 presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, a number that does not reflect online streaming. Since 1960, no year has gone higher than 3.

==History==
The first general presidential debate was not held until 1960, but several other debates are considered predecessors to the presidential debates.

===Lincoln–Douglas debates===
The series of seven debates in 1858 between Abraham Lincoln and Senator Stephen A. Douglas for U.S. Senate were true, face-to-face debates, with no moderator; the candidates took it in turns to open each debate with a one-hour speech, then the other candidate had an hour and a half to rebut, and finally the first candidate closed the debate with a half-hour response. Douglas was later re-elected to the U.S. Senate by the Illinois legislature. Lincoln and Douglas were both nominated for president in 1860 by the Republicans and Northern Democrats, respectively, and their earlier debates helped define their respective positions in that election, but they did not meet during the 1860 presidential election.

===Early presidential primary candidate debates===
Wendell Willkie became the first 20th century presidential candidate to challenge his opponent to a face to face debate when in 1940 he challenged President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but Roosevelt refused. In 1948, presidential candidate debates became a reality when a radio debate was held in Oregon between Republicans Thomas E. Dewey and Harold Stassen during the party&#x27;s presidential primary.

The Democrats followed suit in 1956 with a televised presidential primary debate between Adlai Stevenson and Estes Kefauver, and in 1960 by one between John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey.

In 1956, during the 1956 presidential campaign, University of Maryland student Fred Kahn led an effort to bring the two major presidential candidates, Adlai Stevenson II, the Democratic nominee, and President Dwight Eisenhower, the Republican nominee, to the campus for a debate. Various newspapers were contacted and numerous letters were sent in an effort to generate interest and garner support for the proposal.

Former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was among those who received a letter. Kahn later told Guy Raz during an &quot;All Things Considered&quot; interview on NPR in 2012 that she replied, saying, &quot;not only would the students of the University of Maryland be interested, but also other students.&quot; Roosevelt said that she was going to forward Kahn&#x27;s letter to James Finnegan, Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign manager. In the end, no debate took place, but Kahn&#x27;s effort received national press exposure, helping lay groundwork for the Kennedy–Nixon debates four years later during the 1960 presidential campaign.

===1960 Kennedy–Nixon debates===

The first general election presidential debate was 1960 United States presidential debates, held on September 26, 1960, between Senator John F. Kennedy, the Democratic nominee, and Vice President Richard Nixon, the Republican nominee, at CBS&#x27;s WBBM-TV in Chicago. It was moderated by Howard K. Smith and included a panel composed of Sander Vanocur of NBC News, Charles Warren of Mutual News, Stuart Novins of CBS, and Bob Fleming of ABC News. At the outset, Nixon was considered to have the upper hand due to his knowledge of foreign policy and proficiency in radio debates. However, because of his unfamiliarity with the new format of televised debates, factors such as his underweight and pale appearance, his suit color blending in with the debate set background, and his refusal to use television makeup resulting in a five o&#x27;clock shadow, led to his defeat. Many observers have regarded Kennedy&#x27;s win over Nixon in the first debate as a turning point in the election. After the first debate, polls showed Kennedy moving from a slight deficit into a slight lead over Nixon.

Three more debates were subsequently held between the candidates: on October 7 at the WRC-TV NBC studio in Washington, D.C., narrated by Frank McGee with a panel of four newsmen Paul Niven of CBS, Edward P. Morgan of ABC, Alvin Spivak of United Press International, and Harold R. Levy of &quot;Newsday&quot;, on October 13, with Nixon at the ABC studio in Los Angeles and Kennedy at the ABC studio in New York City, narrated by Bill Shadel with a panel of four newsmen in a different Los Angeles studio; and October 21 at the ABC studio in New York, narrated by Quincy Howe with a panel of four including Frank Singiser, John Edwards, Walter Cronkite, and John Chancellor. Nixon regained his lost weight, wore television makeup, and appeared more forceful than in his initial appearance, winning the second and third debates while the fourth was a draw, however the viewership numbers of these subsequent events did not match the high set by the first debate and ultimately did not help Nixon as he lost the election.

===1976 presidential debate===
After the Kennedy–Nixon debates, it was 16 years before general election presidential candidates again debated each other face to face. During this interval intra-party debates were held during the 1968 Democratic primaries, between Robert F. Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy, and again during the 1972 Democratic primaries, between George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey, and others.

The next presidential candidates debates occurred during the 1976 campaign, when President Gerald Ford, who had entered office two years earlier after President Richard Nixon resigned, agreed to three debates with his Democratic challenger, Jimmy Carter.

The 1976 debates, one on domestic issues, one on foreign policy, and one on any topic, were held before studio audiences, and, like the 1960 debates, were televised nationally. The League of Women Voters sponsored the debates. This was a change from the Kennedy–Nixon debates, which had been sponsored by the television networks themselves.

Roughly an hour into the first televised debate, the broadcast audio coming from the Walnut Street Theatre and fed to all networks suddenly cut out, effectively muting the candidates in the middle of a statement by Carter. The two candidates were initially unaware of this technical glitch and continued to debate, unheard to the television audience. They were soon informed of this problem, and proceeded to stand still and silently at their lecterns for about 27 minutes, until the problem, a blown capacitor, was located and fixed, in time for Carter to briefly finish the statement he had begun when the audio cut out, and for both candidates to issue closing statements.

The dramatic effect of televised presidential debates was demonstrated again in the 1976 debates between Ford and Carter. Ford had already cut into Carter&#x27;s large lead in the polls, and was generally viewed as having won the first debate on domestic policy. Polls released after this first debate indicated the race was even. However, in the second debate on foreign policy, Ford made what was widely viewed as a major blunder when he said &quot;There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.&quot; After this, Ford&#x27;s momentum stalled, and Carter won a very close election.

===1980 and 1984 presidential debates===
The League of Women Voters also sponsored the debates held in 1980 and in 1984.

In 1980, debates were a major factor again. Earlier in the election season, President Carter held a substantial lead over his opponents. Three debates between Carter, former California Governor Ronald Reagan and Illinois Congressman John B. Anderson (who was running as an independent), were originally scheduled; along with a single vice presidential debate between incumbent Walter Mondale, former CIA Director George Bush, and former Wisconsin Governor Patrick Joseph Lucey. Carter refused to debate if Anderson was present and Reagan refused to debate without Anderson, resulting in the first debate being between Reagan and Anderson only. The second debate and the vice presidential debate were both cancelled. Reagan eventually conceded to Carter&#x27;s demand, and a single debate took place with only Carter and Reagan. With years of experience in front of a camera as an actor, Reagan came across much better than Carter in the debate and was judged by voters to have won by a wide margin. Reagan&#x27;s debate performance likely helped propel his landslide victory in the general election.

The Reagan campaign had access to internal debate briefing materials for Carter; the exposure of this in 1983 led to a public scandal called &quot;Debategate&quot;.

In 1984, former Vice President Walter Mondale won the first debate over President Ronald Reagan, generating much-needed donations to Mondale&#x27;s lagging campaign. The second presidential debate was held on October 21, 1984, where Ronald Reagan used a joke, &quot;I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent&#x27;s youth and inexperience&quot;, which effectively stalled Mondale&#x27;s momentum.

Since 1976, each presidential election has featured a series of presidential debates. Vice presidential debates have been held regularly since 1984. Vice Presidential debates have been largely uneventful and have historically had little impact on the election. Perhaps the most memorable moment in a vice presidential debate came in the 1988 debate between Republican Dan Quayle and Democrat Lloyd Bentsen. Quayle&#x27;s selection by the incumbent vice-president and Republican presidential candidate George Bush was widely criticized; one reason being his relative lack of experience. In the debate, Quayle attempted to ease this fear by stating that he had as much experience as John F. Kennedy did when he ran for president in 1960. Democrat Bentsen countered with the now famous statement: &quot;Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you&#x27;re no Jack Kennedy.&quot;

===1992 presidential debates===
In 1992, the first debate was held involving both major party candidates and a third-party candidate, billionaire Ross Perot, running against President Bush and the Democratic nominee Governor Bill Clinton. That year, President Bush was criticized for his early hesitation to join the debates, and some described him as a &quot;chicken&quot;. Furthermore, he was criticized for looking at his watch which aides initially said was meant to track if the other candidates were debating within their time limits but ultimately it was revealed that the president indeed was checking how much time was left in the debate.

Moderators of nationally televised presidential debates have included Bernard Shaw, Bill Moyers, Jim Lehrer, and Barbara Walters.

===Presidential debates since 1992===
Saint Anselm College has hosted four primary debates throughout 2004 and 2008; it is a favorite for campaign stops and these national debates because of the college&#x27;s history in the New Hampshire primary.

Washington University in St. Louis, however, has hosted the presidential debates (organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates) three times (in 1992, 2000, and 2004), more than any other location prior to 2016, and also hosted one of the 2016 debates. The university was also scheduled to host a debate in 1996, but it was later negotiated between the two presidential candidates to reduce the number of debates from three to two. The university hosted the only 2008 vice presidential debate, as well.

Hofstra University, originally an alternate site, was named the host of the first presidential debate in 2016, after Wright State University withdrew with eight weeks remaining. This positioned Hofstra to be the only school to host presidential debates in three consecutive campaign cycles. Most of the presidential/vice presidential debates have been moderated by ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX, NBC, and/or PBS. PBS currently holds the record for the most debates at 16.

==Rules and format==
Some of the debates can feature the candidates standing behind their podiums, or in conference tables with the moderator on the other side. Depending on the agreed format, either the moderator or an audience member can be the one to ask questions. Typically there are no opening statements, just closing statements.

A coin toss determines who gets to answer the first question and who will make their closing remarks first. Each candidate will get alternate turns. Once a question is asked, the candidate has 2 minutes to answer the question. After this, the opposing candidate has around 1 minute to respond and rebut her/his arguments. At the moderator&#x27;s discretion, the discussion of the question may be extended by 30 seconds per candidate.

In recent debates, colored lights resembling traffic lights have been installed to aid the candidate as to the time left with green indicating 30 seconds, yellow indicating 15 seconds and red indicating only 5 seconds are left. If necessary, a buzzer may be used or a flag.

==Debate sponsorship==

Control of the presidential debates has been a ground of struggle for more than two decades. The role was filled by the nonpartisan League of Women Voters (LWV) civic organization in 1976, 1980 and 1984. In 1987, the LWV withdrew from debate sponsorship, in protest of the major party candidates attempting to dictate nearly every aspect of how the debates were conducted. On October 2, 1988, the LWV&#x27;s 14 trustees voted unanimously to pull out of the debates, and on October 3 they issued a press release:

The League of Women Voters is withdrawing sponsorship of the presidential debates...because the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter. It has become clear to us that the candidates&#x27; organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign-trail charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and answers to tough questions. The League has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public.

According to the LWV, they pulled out because &quot;the campaigns presented the League with their debate agreement on September 28, two weeks before the scheduled debate. The campaigns&#x27; agreement was negotiated &#x27;behind closed doors&#x27; ... [with] 16 pages of conditions not subject to negotiation. Most objectionable to the League...were conditions in the agreement that gave the campaigns unprecedented control over the proceedings... [including] control the selection of questioners, the composition of the audience, hall access for the press and other issues.&quot;

The same year the two major political parties assumed control of organizing presidential debates through the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The commission has been headed since its inception by former chairs of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee.

Some have criticized the exclusion of third party and independent candidates as contributing to lower results for candidates such as the Libertarian Party or the Green Party. Others criticize the parallel interview format as a minimum of getting 15 percent in opinion polls of the CPD&#x27;s choosing is required to be invited. In 2004, the Citizens&#x27; Debate Commission (CDC) was formed with the stated mission of returning control of the debates to an independent nonpartisan body rather than a bipartisan body. Nevertheless, the CPD retained control of the debates that year and in 2008.

In 2024, the Democratic and Republican parties opted out of the CPD debates, in favor of debates in June and September produced by CNN and ABC News respectively. They later agreed to a vice presidential debate in October, which would be hosted by CBS News. All three debates were conducted with no audience or outside press, but would be made available to other broadcasters. The RNC had withdrew from the CPD in 2022 because they felt it &quot;[was] biased and has refused to enact simple and common-sense reforms to help ensure fair debates, including hosting debates before voting begins and selecting moderators who have never worked for candidates on the debate stage.&quot;Joe Biden campaign manager Jen O&#x27;Malley Dillon stated that the debates had become too much of a &quot;spectacle&quot;, the CPD was not consistently enforcing its rules in prior debates, and that the debates&#x27; timetable did not end before the start of early voting. This marked the first time the CPD had not sponsored a presidential debate since 1988.

<text>Anarcha-feminism, also known as anarchist feminism or anarcho-feminism, is a system of analysis which combines the principles and power analysis of anarchist theory with feminism. It closely resembles intersectional feminism. Anarcha-feminism generally posits that patriarchy and traditional gender roles as manifestations of involuntary coercive hierarchy should be replaced by decentralized free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class conflict and the anarchist struggle against the state and capitalism. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. Canadian anarcha-feminist writer L. Susan Brown claims that &quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist&quot;.

== History ==
=== Background ===
Anarchism first emerged as a political current at a time when gender inequality was systematically enforced and women were excluded from public life. Their existence was confined to the traditional gender roles of mothers and wives, within the construct of the nuclear family. In particular, working-class women were both politically and economically disenfranchised, which drove them closer to socialism and political militancy. They began to agitate for reproductive rights and free love, which formed the basis for an anarchist feminism.

The earliest proponents of anarchism were initially reluctant to approach the subject of feminism: Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was openly hostile to feminist demands of gender equality and upheld traditional family values; Peter Kropotkin thought that feminist goals should be subordinated to the class struggle; and Benjamin Tucker opposed the demand of &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot;. It was only after Mikhail Bakunin made the abolition of gender inequality one of the aims of the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy that women&#x27;s rights became a primary concern for the anarchist movement. Anarcho-communists adopted Friedrich Engels&#x27; critique of the family, which held it to be the origin of both gender inequality and economic inequality. This anti-authoritarian critique of power within the institutions of marriage and the nuclear family began to attract many feminists towards anarchism. The subsequent synthesis of anarchism and feminism, although not explicitly labelled as such at the time, later came to be known as anarcha-feminism.

=== First wave (1880s–1940s) ===
During the 1880s, a current of anarchist feminism was first developed by the Catalan activists Teresa Mañé and Teresa Claramunt. By the 1890s, anarchist feminism had spread across the globe, brought by immigrants to and from Europe. The anarchist press started to publish feminist analyses on gender equality and critiques of marriage, the nuclear family and prostitution. Through Errico Malatesta&#x27;s &quot;La Questione Sociale&quot;, Teresa Mañé&#x27;s pamphlets on female education and gender inequality received widespread publication. Anarchist feminism was further taken up by the American anarchists Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman, the latter of whom came to be considered a &quot;founding mother&quot; of anarcha-feminism. Lucy Parsons also established the Working Women&#x27;s Union in Chicago and ensured women&#x27;s participation in the Industrial Workers of the World as one of its founding members. In England, the anarchist Charlotte Wilson became an advocate for &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot; and promoted women&#x27;s education.

Anarchist women took prominent positions within the editorial boards of magazines (such as Mother Earth), in the publication of books, and as public speakers. Specifically feminist publications were also circulated, including &quot;Germinal&quot;, &quot;El Oprimido&quot; and &quot;La Voz de la Mujer&quot;, in which anarchist women defended a revolutionary form of feminism. As a way to counter the Culture of Domesticity, which upheld the private property of the nuclear family, anarchist women like Charlotte Wilson opened their homes into &quot;quasi-public spaces&quot; for political meetings and communal meals. Anarchist women even took part in violent direct actions, including Vera Zasulich&#x27;s attempted assassination of the Russian police chief Fyodor Trepov; Germaine Berton&#x27;s murder of the French far-right politician Marius Plateau; and Kanno Sugako&#x27;s plot to assassinate the Japanese Emperor Meiji.

The rise of anarchist feminism provoked an anti-feminist reaction among many of the men of the anarchist movement, who deemphasised the struggle for women&#x27;s rights as secondary to the class struggle. In turn, &quot;La Voz de la Mujer&quot; denounced these men as &quot;false anarchists&quot; who prioritised their own liberation over that of women. In the Chinese anarcha-feminist journal &quot;Natural Justice&quot;, He Zhen also criticised what she saw as &quot;men&#x27;s pursuit of self distinction in the name of women&#x27;s liberation&quot;. Anarcha-feminists generally concluded that male hostility to feminism proved them unreliable to the cause for women&#x27;s rights, and began to organise their own movement to address their own needs.

First-wave feminists established women&#x27;s groups as flat organizations that used consensus decision-making, reflecting an &quot;unconscious libertarian consciousness&quot;. Anarchist women&#x27;s groups were established throughout the United States, largely by Italian immigrant women, with the goal of pursuing &quot;women&#x27;s emancipation&quot; through mutual aid and self-organization. In Paterson, New Jersey, the &quot;Gruppo Emancipazione della Donna&quot; formed women&#x27;s theater and music clubs, and publicised works of anarchist feminism that linked the struggle against the patriarchy with the struggle against the &quot;patria&quot;. In contrast to the Italian anarchists, Jewish anarchists rarely formed specific women&#x27;s groups, with anarchists of the journal &quot;Fraye Arbeter Shtime&quot; declaring themselves to all be feminists.

One of the most notable libertarian women&#x27;s groups was the Mujeres Libres, an anarchist feminist organisation that aimed for women&#x27;s liberation from their &quot;triple enslavement&quot; by ignorance, exploitation and discrimination. Founded during the Spanish Revolution of 1936 by Lucía Sánchez Saornil, Mercè Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gascón, the Mujeres Libres implemented programmes of women&#x27;s education that taught women technical skills and increased female literacy. Sánchez Saornil herself wrote poetry that called for women to take action against their oppression, which attracted Emma Goldman to visit Spain and participate in the work of the Mujeres Libres as an advocate.

But the anarchist feminism of the time, focused more on developing small activist groups than creating a mass movement, lacked a precise strategy for achieving women&#x27;s rights, so little action in that way was taken. During the early 20th century, anarchist feminism was progressively supplanted by socialist feminism, which took a reformist approach towards achieving women&#x27;s suffrage. By this time Charlotte Wilson had herself abandoned anarchist activism, becoming involved in women&#x27;s suffrage advocacy and later joining the Independent Labour Party. Anarchist feminist critiques of the family and authoritarianism went into remission, only to be reformulated when a new wave of feminism emerged.

=== Second wave (1960s–1980s) ===
By the late 1960s, second-wave feminism had emerged from the New Left, as part of a broad wave of anti-oppression activism that included the civil rights movement and culminated with the protests of 1968. Drawing from socialist feminism, this second-wave sought to encourage solidarity between women, bringing them together into a &quot;&quot; based on their shared experiences. During this period, feminists rediscovered the work of first-wave anarchist feminists like Emma Goldman and before long the women&#x27;s liberation movement began to reshape the anarchist movement. Many second-wave feminists came to consider anarchism to be the &quot;logically consistent expression of feminism&quot;, due to its synthesis of the struggle for individual liberty with that for social equality. Peggy Kornegger claimed that feminists had already been &quot;unconscious anarchists in both theory and practice&quot; and were the only activist tendency to be &quot;practic[ing] what anarchism preaches&quot;.

The pervasive environment of sexism within many sections of the New Left gave an impulse to the establishment of women&#x27;s groups as part of a strategy of feminist separatism, which led to the coining and adoption of the term &quot;anarcha-feminist&quot; by anarchist women. Second-wave anarchist feminists developed their own affinity groups according to cooperative, decentralist and federalist principles, as an alterative to both patriarchal and structureless organisations. The anarcha-feminist drive to reckon with these hierarchical forms of organisation was particularly influenced by Jo Freeman&#x27;s 1972 essay &quot;The Tyranny of Structurelessness&quot;, which encouraged an organized egalitarian tendency within the movement.

The second wave of anarchist feminism was also characterised by an often violent militancy, as displayed in the SCUM Manifesto. Anarcha-feminists such as Ann Hansen participated in the bombing attacks by the urban guerrilla group Direct Action, which targeted companies that produced parts for weapons of war and a chain video store that was distributing snuff films and paedophilic pornography.

By the 1980s, the feminist sex wars had caused a divide within second-wave feminism, which fragmented into multiple different tendencies, while many former feminists moved into academic careerism.

=== Third wave (1990s–2000s) ===
The beginnings of the anti-globalization movement spurred the development of a new wave, with reflections on the earlier second-wave and the influence of postcolonial feminism leading to an integration of identity politics into the framework of anarchist feminism. The emergence of a third-wave of anarcha-feminism brought with it a new focus on intersectionality, as anarcha-feminists came together to address the intersecting issues of poverty, racism and reproductive rights, among many others. The early feminist conception of a &quot;New Woman&quot; also formed part of the foundation for third-wave anarcha-feminism, which encouraged women to practice equality rather than to demand it. In Bolivia, the Mujeres Creando carried out direct actions that challenged poverty and traditional gender roles. In the United States, anarcha-feminists within the anarcho-punk scene spurred the development of the Riot grrrl subculture.

With the turn of the 21st century, there was a concerted effort to rethink approaches to anarcha-feminist histories, placing value in collective, open and non-hierarchical methods of gathering and exchanging knowledge. Collective research projects were carried out by groups such as the Dark Star Collective, which in 2002 published an anthology of anarcha-feminist works titled &quot;Quiet Rumours&quot;. In 2010, the feminist historian Judy Greenway elaborated five different methodologies of anarcha-feminist historiography:

#The &quot;additive approach&quot;, which incorporates elements otherwise overlooked in existing historiography;
#The &quot;Emma Goldman Short-Circuit&quot;, which centres the contributions of Emma Goldman above all others;
#The &quot;women&#x27;s issues approach&quot;, which is chiefly concerned with issues of sexuality and reproductive rights;
#The &quot;inclusive approach&quot;, which focuses on the role of women in famous historical events;
#The &quot;transformative approach&quot;, which takes a critical look at the erasure of women and privileged position of men in gendered histories.

Greenway concluded that a complete anarcha-feminist historiography needed to actively challenge hierarchical biases within dominant historiographies, rather than merely reincorporating erased aspects of history or focusing excessively on one or two individuals.

=== Fourth wave (2012–present) ===
The fourth wave of feminism emerged through the development of postfeminism, taking concern with the objectification of women by market forces and characterised by its use of social networking. The fourth wave of anarchist feminism was particularly influenced by postmodern feminism.

In a 2017 article, Chiara Bottici argued that anarcha-feminism has been the subject of insufficient discussion in public debate and in academia, due in part to a broader hostility to anarchism but also due to difficulties in distinguishing between the tendency of anarcha-feminism and the broader philosophy of anarchism. Bottici argued that the risk of economic reductionism that appears in Marxist feminism, in which women&#x27;s oppression is understood solely in economic terms, &quot;has ... always been alien to anarcha-feminism&quot;; as such, she argues, anarchism is better suited than Marxism for an alliance with feminism.

== Theory ==
Anarcha-feminism has a diverse range of thought, but is generally characterised by the principles of women&#x27;s autonomy, free love and intersectionality. Anarcha-feminists are committed to women&#x27;s empowerment in social and political life, opposing capitalism and the state as key instruments of institutional discrimination against women.

=== Anti-authoritarianism ===
Anarcha-feminism expanded on the traditional anarchist principles of anti-statism, anti-clericalism and anti-capitalism, demonstrating their role in institutional discrimination such as sexism, racism and homophobia. In her 1895 essay entitled &quot;Sex Slavery&quot;, Voltairine de Cleyre claimed that sexism was caused by the institutional authoritarianism upheld by the clergy and the state.

Anarcha-feminists see the patriarchy and the state as two expressions of the same system of oppression, and concluded that the destruction of all forms of patriarchy would necessarily include the abolition of the state. Emma Goldman herself took an intersectional analysis of the state which saw it as an instrument of sexual repression, and thus rejected the strategy of reformism. As such, the first-wave of anarchist feminists criticised calls for women&#x27;s suffrage, considering them to be insufficient for achieving gender equality. He Zhen was skeptical of the limited gender equality achieved in western liberal democracies, which she described as &quot;false freedom and sham equality&quot;, even criticising the women&#x27;s suffrage movement and male feminists for espousing an &quot;empty rhetoric of emancipation&quot;.

=== Free love ===
Anarchist feminists have developed a non-coercive approach to interpersonal relationships, which particularly upholds the value of consent. Anarchist feminists such as Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman fiercely criticised the institution of marriage, as they considered it to be inherently oppressive towards women due to its lack of consent.

Their critiques of marriage led them to advocate for and practice free love, which they held to be a remedy to women&#x27;s social alienation. With its basis in freely-given consent, free love provided room for women to reconstruct their sexuality in a way that centered their own agency and autonomy. Emma Goldman herself saw sexuality as a &quot;critical social force&quot; of free expression, She extended this to a public defense of gay rights, with some scholars even speculating about her own sexuality.

On the other hand, free love was opposed by Lucy Parsons, who criticised it as being inconsistent with anarchism and for its increased risks of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, instead arguing for a form of &quot;monogamy without marriage&quot;.

=== Intersectionality ===
From the inception of anarcha-feminism as a current, anarchist feminists have engaged with other struggles that intersect with women&#x27;s issues, participating in a number of different anti-racist and anti-colonial movements. A specifically anti-racist anarcha-feminism was pioneered during the 1970s by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and her organization Cell 16.

In 1976, a statement produced by the Combahee River Collective lay the groundwork for the development of intersectionality. Since the third-wave, intersectionality has formed one of the core concepts of anarchist feminism, which has used it as a method to develop a feminist ethics of self-organization against all forms of oppression. Groups within the activist network No one is illegal (NOII) have since engaged in an anti-racist anarcha-feminism as part of their anti-border advocacy, which was itself rooted in an anti-statist critique of institutional sexism and racism within state immigration regimes.

Drawing from post-structuralism, postcolonialism and critical theory, Deric Shannon has proposed a contemporary construction of anarcha-feminism that engages with each of these theories, combining anti-capitalism with a comprehensive intersectional stance against all forms of oppression.

=== Individualism ===
Anarcha-feminism holds the principle that &quot;the personal is political&quot;, developing a critique of everyday life that aims to erode social and political power, in pursuit of a society where each individual had control over &quot;[their] own life, and no others&quot;. Anarcha-feminists considered the nuclear family to be the root of all gender inequality, and thus that equality could only be achieved through the extension of personal autonomy and economic independence to women. Although the institution of private property was roundly critiqued by anarcho-communists such as Emma Goldman, it was upheld as a means of women&#x27;s economic emancipation by Voltairine de Cleyre.

Anarchist feminists such as Itō Noe have upheld the ideal of a &quot;New Woman&quot;, encouraging women to assert their own individuality and develop independent thought. Emma Goldman conceived of a revolution that takes place within individual minds, as well as in society. Goldman advocated for women to exercise their autonomy by overcoming their own &quot;internal tyrants&quot;, whether that be the opinions of their family members or traditional Social norms. According to Martha Hewitt, the anarcha-feminist conception of revolution is &quot;as process, transformative &quot;praxis&quot; of thought, feeling, and collective social activity.&quot;

In the 1993 book &quot;The Politics of Individualism&quot;, the anarcha-feminist L. Susan Brown developed what she called an &quot;existential individualism&quot;, which upheld individual autonomy and voluntary cooperation.

=== Reproductive rights ===
During the late 19th century, anarchist women were among the earliest to take up the call for reproductive rights, as part of the anarchist feminist opposition to the nuclear family. Anarchist feminists have distributed information about and resources for birth control, for which many were put in jail. While working as a midwife during the 1890s, Emma Goldman became a prominent advocate of women&#x27;s reproductive rights, calling for women&#x27;s rights to practice family planning and publicly rallying support for Margaret Sanger. In contrast, other anarchist feminists such as Itō Noe opposed abortion from a humanist perspective, as she believed that life began at conception.

Anarchist advocacy for birth control increased following World War I, as the practice was banned in countries like France and the United States, which anarchist feminists criticised a means to continue increasing the population in order to wage war. Anarchist feminist direct action for birth control continued even after the partial legalisation of abortion, as &quot;feminist outlaw&quot; groups like the Jane Collective provided food and medical care for women without access to safe methods of birth control. Anarchist feminists have also participated in the movement for reproductive justice, which has prioritised bodily autonomy and the reproductive self-determination of women of color.

=== Sex work ===
Anarcha-feminists have been at the forefront of advocacy for sex workers&#x27; rights since the late-19th century, when anarchist women in Germany and France campaigned for the decriminalisation of sex work. Louise Michel blamed capitalism for creating the economic conditions that drove women towards sex work, which she claimed could only be brought to an end by means of a social revolution. Itō Noe likewise argued that the root cause of women taking up sex work was poverty, and that instead of campaigning to abolish sex work, people should address the root causes of poverty. Emma Goldman also publicly criticised sex work abolitionists for using male legal systems to criminalise women, which she held to be a form of class discrimination.

Following the second-wave of feminism, sex worker advocacy was taken up by anarchist feminists that themselves engaged in sex work. Grisélidis Réal organised sex workers and carried out a series of direct actions for sex workers&#x27; rights, going on to establish an archive for the history of sex work. Canadian anarchist sex workers were also involved in an advocacy campaign, culminating with the declaration of an &quot;International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers&quot;.

<doc id="222075" wikidata="Q1027051" url="?curid=222075" title="Calixa Lavallée">
<text>Calixa Lavallée (; December 28, 1842 – January 21, 1891) was a Canadian musician and Union Army band musician during the American Civil War. He was born in the Province of Canada. He is best known for composing the music for &quot;O Canada&quot;, which officially became the national anthem of Canada in 1980, after a vote in the Senate and the House of Commons. The same 1980 Act of Parliament also changed some of the English lyrics. A further alteration to the English lyrics was made again in 2018. The original French lyrics and the music, however, have remained unchanged since 1880.

==Early life and education==
Lavallée was born Calixte Paquet dit Lavallée, the son of Jean Baptiste Paquet and Charlotte Valentine. He was born near Verchères, a village near present-day Montreal in the Province of Canada (now the Canadian province of Quebec). He was a descendant of Isaac Pasquier, from Poitou, France, who arrived in Nouvelle-France in 1665 as a soldier in the Carignan-Salières regiment. Lavallée&#x27;s father Augustin Lavallée, worked as a blacksmith, logger, bandmaster, self-taught luthier and bandleader, and also worked for the pipe organ builder Joseph Casavant. Calixa Lavallée&#x27;s mother was Charlotte-Caroline Valentine, descendant of James Valentine, a soldier from Montrose, Scotland who married a Quebecer by the name of Louise Leclerc and then settled down in Verchères, Québec.

Lavallée began his musical education with his father (Eli Grande), who taught him organ by age 11. Lavallée also studied in Montréal with Paul Letondal and Charles Wugk Sabatier.

==Career==
Lavallée gave his first performance at Montreal&#x27;s Theatre Royal (on Côté Street) on 28 February 1859 and later that year he was hired by Charles Duprez to play violin, cornet, and piano in a travelling minstrel troupe. With this company, the New Orleans Minstrels, Lavallée travelled through much of the United States in the years leading up to the outbreak of the Civil War.

On September 17, 1861, Lavallée enlisted in the 4th Rhode Island Infantry Regiment in Providence, as a private and a musician in the regimental band. He served with the 4th in the American Civil War until he was mustered out on October 3, 1862. He then rejoined Duprez&#x27;s company and continued to tour until the fall of 1863, when he returned to Montreal.

Between December 1863 and the early months of 1866 Lavallée organized concerts, composed and taught. In 1866, he was hired once again by Duprez and left for the US, where he would remain until 1872. In December 1867, he married an American woman, Josephine Gentilly, while in Lowell, Massachusetts.

After two years in Paris, Lavallée returned to Montreal in July 1875, where he continued to perform and compose. Between 1875 and 1880, he lived in Montreal and Quebec City, where he worked as a pianist, organist and music teacher, and also conducted orchestral and operatic productions in concert halls, including the Montréal Academy of Music in Montréal, Quebec City and in many U.S. cities. Among his pupils was composer Alexis Contant.

To celebrate St. Jean-Baptiste Day in 1880, the Lieutenant Governor of Québec, Théodore Robitaille, commissioned Lavallée to compose &quot;O Canada&quot; to a patriotic poem by Adolphe-Basile Routhier. After some financial difficulties in Canada, Lavallée again moved to the United States. In his later life he promoted the idea of union between Canada and the U.S.

==Later life and death==
During the later years of his life, Lavallée was the choirmaster at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston, and he died penniless in that city in 1891. As the result of the campaign by the Montréal-based music director of the Victoria&#x27;s Rifles, Joseph-Laurent Gariépy, his remains were returned to Montréal and reinterred at Côte-des-Neiges Cemetery in 1933.

<doc id="222076" wikidata="Q157022" url="?curid=222076" title="List of rulers of Bavaria">
<text>The following is a list of monarchs during the history of Bavaria. Bavaria was ruled by several dukes and kings, partitioned and reunited, under several dynasties. Since 1918, Bavaria has been under a republican form of government, and from 1949, Bavaria has been a democratic state in the Federal Republic of Germany.

==Monarchs of Bavaria==
===Ducal Bavaria (also known as the &quot;Old Stem duchy&quot;)===
====Agilolfing dynasty====
Around 548 the kings of the Franks placed the border region of Bavaria under the administration of a duke—possibly Frankish or possibly chosen from amongst the local leading families—who was supposed to act as a regional governor for the Frankish king. The first duke we know of, and likely the first, was Gariwald, or Garibald I, a member of the powerful Agilolfing family. This was the beginning of a series of Agilolfing dukes that was to last until 788.

===Carolingian dynasty and dominion from the Holy Roman Empire===
The kings (later emperors) of the Franks now assumed complete control, placing Bavaria under the rule of non-hereditary governors and civil servants. They were not dukes but rather kings of Bavaria. Emperor Louis the Pious divided control of the Empire among his sons, and the divisions became permanent in the decades following his death in 840. The Frankish rulers controlled Bavaria as part of their possessions.

===Ducal Bavaria (also known as the &quot;Younger Stem duchy&quot;)===
Ruled by an array of dukes from an array of rivaling houses, individually appointed to office.

====Luitpolding dynasty, 911–947====
Luitpold, founder of the Luitpolding dynasty, was not a duke of Bavaria but a margrave of Carinthia under the rule of Louis the Child. Frankish power had waned in the region due to Hungarian attacks, allowing the local rulers greater independence. Luitpold&#x27;s son, Arnulf, claimed the title of duke (implying full autonomy) in 911 and was recognized as such by King Henry the Fowler of Germany in 920.

====German kings, 947–1070====
From 947 until the 11th century, the kings of Germany repeatedly transferred Bavaria into different hands (including their own), never allowing any one family to establish itself. Bavaria was ruled by a series of short-lasting, mostly unrelated dynasties.

====Houses of Welf and Babenberg, 1070–1180====
In 1070, Emperor Henry IV deposed Duke Otto, granting the duchy instead to Welf I, a member of the Italo-Bavarian family of Este. Welf I subsequently quarreled with King Henry and was deprived of his duchy for nineteen years, during which it was directly administered by the German crown. Welf I recovered the duchy in 1096, and was succeeded by his sons Welf II and Henry IX—the latter was succeeded by his son Henry X, who also became Duke of Saxony.

===Ducal and Electoral Bavaria (Hereditary dukes)===

In 1180, Henry XII &quot;the Lion&quot; and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, fell out. The emperor consequently dispossessed the duke and gave his territory to Otto I, Duke of Bavaria of the House of Wittelsbach. From now on, Bavaria remained in the possession of various branches of the family for 738 years until the end of the First World War.

====First partition, 1253–1340====
In 1253, on Otto II&#x27;s death, Bavaria was divided between his sons. Henry became Duke of Lower Bavaria and Louis of Upper Bavaria. From this point until the beginning of the 16th century, the territories were frequently divided between brothers, making the dukes difficult to list.

In Lower Bavaria, Henry XIII was succeeded by his three sons, Otto III, Louis III, and Stephen I ruling jointly. Otto III&#x27;s successor in the joint dukedom was his son Henry XV. Stephen&#x27;s successors were his sons Otto IV and Henry XIV. Henry XIV&#x27;s son was John I.

In Upper Bavaria, Louis II was succeeded by his sons Rudolf I and Louis IV. The latter was elected King of Germany in 1314. After John I&#x27;s death in 1340, Louis IV unified the Bavarian duchy.

The dukes of Upper Bavaria served also as Counts Palatinate of the Rhine. In 1329 Louis IV released the Palatinate of the Rhine including the Bavarian Upper Palatinate to the sons of Rudolf I. The Upper Palatinate would be reunited with Bavaria in 1623, the Lower Palatinate in 1777.

====Second partition 1349–1503====
From 1349 until 1503 the second partition of Bavaria took place. In 1349, the six sons of Louis IV partitioned Bavaria into Upper and Lower Bavaria again. In 1353, Lower Bavaria was partitioned into Bavaria-Landshut and Bavaria-Straubing. Upper Bavaria was partitioned between Bavaria-Straubing and Bavaria-Landshut in 1363. After the death of Stephan II in 1392, Bavaria-Landshut was broken into three duchies, John II gained Bavaria-Munich, Frederick, Duke of Bavaria-Landshut received a smaller Bavaria-Landshut, and in Bavaria-Ingolstadt ruled Stephen III, Duke of Bavaria.

Following the Landshut War (1503–1505), the Duke of Bavaria-Munich Albert IV the Wise became ruler of Bavaria. In 1506 Albert decreed that the duchy should pass according to the rules of primogeniture.

In 1623 Maximilian I was granted the title Prince-elector (German: &quot;Kurfürst&quot;) of the Rhenish Palatinate.

===House of Wittelsbach===
====Partitions of Bavaria under Wittelsbach rule====
====Table of rulers====


===Kingdom of Bavaria===
In 1805 under the Peace of Pressburg between Napoleonic France and the Holy Roman Empire several duchies were elevated to kingdoms. The Wittelsbach rulers of Bavaria held the title &quot;King of Bavaria&quot; from 1806 until 1918. The prince-elector of Bavaria, Maximilian IV Joseph formally assumed the title King Maximilian I of Bavaria on 1 January 1806. The well-known so called &quot;Märchenkönig&quot; (Fairy tale king) Ludwig II constructed Neuschwanstein Castle, Herrenchiemsee, and Linderhof Palace during his reign (1864–1886), threatening not only to go bankrupt in person, but also to bankrupt the country in the process. In 1918 Ludwig III lost his throne in the German Revolution of 1918–1919.

== Post-monarchy ==

In 1918, at the end of the First World War in the German Revolution of 1918–1919, Bavaria became a democratic republic within the Weimar Republic; the name for the period of Germany from 1919 to 1933. Since then, the heads of government of Bavaria have been ministers-president.

==Family tree==
Note that Dukes called Louis are usually numbered from Louis the Kelheimer (r. 1189–1231), although four Dukes of Bavaria had been called Louis before that. The same applies to Dukes called Otto, who are sometimes renumbered starting with Otto III, the first Wittelsbach Duke of Bavaria. The highest number has been used in this chart to minimise confusion, with one exception: Ludwig is the German for Louis, but Kings Ludwig I, II and III are not numbered XV, XVI and XVII.

<doc id="222079" wikidata="Q111674" url="?curid=222079" title="Large-billed crow">
<text>The large-billed crow (Corvus macrorhynchos), formerly referred to widely as the jungle crow, is a widespread Asian species of crow. It is very adaptable and is able to survive on a wide range of food sources, making it capable of colonizing new areas, due to which it is often considered a nuisance, especially on islands. It has a large bill, which is the source of its scientific name &quot;macrorhynchos&quot; (Ancient Greek for &quot;long-billed&quot;) and it is sometimes known by the common name thick-billed crow. It can also be mistaken for a common raven. The eastern jungle crow and Indian jungle crow were once considered conspecific and together called the jungle crow.

==Subspecies==
The large-billed crow was formally described in 1837 by the German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler under the current binomial name &quot;Corvus macrorhynchos&quot;. The type locality is the island of Java. The specific epithet &quot;macrorhynchos&quot; is from Ancient Greek μακρορρυγχος/&quot;makrorrhunkhos&quot; meaning &quot;long-billed&quot;.

Eight subspecies are recognised. Some are distinctive vocally, morphologically and genetically, leading to treatments that raise some of them into species status.
* &quot;C. m. japonensis&quot; Bonaparte, 1850 – central, south Sakhalin, Kuril Islands and Japan
* &quot;C. m. connectens&quot; Stresemann, 1916 – Ryukyu Islands (southwest of Japan)
* &quot;C. m. osai&quot; Ogawa, 1905 – south Ryukyu Islands (southwest of Japan)
* &quot;C. m. mandshuricus&quot; Buturlin, 1913 – east, southeast Siberia, north Sakhalin, Korea Peninsula and northeast China
* &quot;C. m. colonorum&quot; Swinhoe, 1864 – central, south China, Taiwan, Hainan Island (off southeast China) and north Indochina
* &quot;C. m. tibetosinensis&quot; Kleinschmidt &amp; Weigold, 1922 – Tibet and the east Himalayas to north Myanmar and south China
* &quot;C. m. intermedius&quot; Adams, 1859 – Afghanistan and Pakistan through the central Himalayas
* &quot;C. m. macrorhynchos&quot; Wagler, 1827 – Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and Bali to Romang and Sermata (east Lesser Sunda Islands)

Former subspecies now considered to be distinct species:
* Eastern jungle crow (&quot;Corvus levaillantii&quot;)
* Indian jungle crow (&quot;Corvus culminatus&quot;)
* Philippine jungle crow (&quot;Corvus philippinus&quot;)

==Description==
The overall size (length: 46–59 cm; 18–23 in). Wingspan is (100–130 cm; 39–51 in). Body proportions vary regionally. In the far northeast in Japan, the Kuriles and the Sakhalin peninsula, it is somewhat larger than the carrion crow. All taxa have a relatively long bill with the upper one quite thick and arched, making it look heavy and almost raven-like. Generally, all taxa have dark greyish plumage from the back of the head, neck, shoulders and lower body. Their wings, tail, face, and throat are glossy black. The depth of the grey shading varies across its range.

==Distribution and habitat==

The range of this species is extensive and stretches from the northeastern Asian seaboard to Afghanistan and eastern Iran in the west, through South and Southeast Asia, to the Lesser Sundas and Cambodia in the southeast. It occurs in woodland, parks and gardens, cultivated regions with at least some trees, but is a bird of more open country in the south of its range where it is not in competition with the common raven and carrion crow of the north.

==Ecology and behaviour==

===Diet===
Extremely versatile in its feeding, it will take food from the ground or in trees. They feed on a wide range of items and will attempt to feed on anything appearing edible, alive or dead, plant or animal. It is also one of the most persistent species and is quite bold, especially in urban areas. In Japan, crows are considered to be a pest, as they rip open garbage bags and take wire coat hangers for their nests. The Japanese subspecies of Large-billed crow are also known for their regular, unprovoked attacks on humans, especially when passing through near their nesting areas. In Sri Lanka, Karunarathna &amp; Amarasinghe (2008) noted that the jungle crow might actually be a, if not the, major predator of local small animals; jungle crows are highly experienced at catching lizards, taking only 45 minutes to find, catch and consume four critically endangered endemic lizards in Horton Plains National Park.

Hoarding behaviour has been noted in ssp. &quot;culminatus&quot;.

===Breeding===
The nest is a platform of twigs, usually high up on a tree with a preference for tall conifers like fir or pine. There are normally 3–5 eggs laid and they are incubated for 17–19 days. The young are fledged usually by about the 35th day. In India, the large-billed crow breed from March to May, but in the plains some of them start even in mid December. The nest is built in a fork of a tree, and is a shallow cup of sticks, sometimes neat and well made, sometimes sketchy and ragged; it is lined with grass roots, wool, rags, vegetable fibre, and similar materials. Some nests have been found to be built partly or exclusively of wire.


The normal clutch consists of four or five eggs, and rarely six or seven. The egg is a broad oval, rather pointed at the smaller end. The texture is hard and fine and there is a fair gloss. The ground colour is any shade of blue-green, and is blotched, speckled and streaked with dull reddish-brown, pale sepia, grey and neutral tint. In size the eggs average about 1.45 by 1.05 inches. The jungle crow can serve as a host for the Asian koel.

===Roosting===
Gregarious at roosts with many thousands at some roost sites. Large flocks may be seen at dusk arriving at major roost sites. These roosts show no apparent reduction even during the breeding season, and this is because they do not breed during their first year. During the day pairs may be involved in defending their territory but at night they may roost in large groups. They have linear dominance hierarchies that are remembered based on individual recognition.

==Voice==

The voice is similar to the house crow to which it is closest, but deeper and usually more resonant and described as the usual loud &quot;caa-haa-caa&quot;. However, it makes a range of calls, some which could be described as &quot;cau cau&quot; and others that could be mistaken for a woodpecker drumming.

==Mortality factors==
There are few predators of this species. Filarial parasites have been reported from this species. Pathogenic viruses such as H5N1 have been noted to cause mortality in Japan. Large scale deaths have also been noted to be caused by &quot;Clostridium&quot; infection and enteritis.

<doc id="222080" wikidata="Q247472" url="?curid=222080" title="Hawaiian crow">
<text>The Hawaiian crow or alalā (Corvus hawaiiensis) is a species of bird in the crow family, Corvidae, that is currently extinct in the wild, though reintroduction programs are underway. It is about the size of the carrion crow at in length, but with more rounded wings and a much thicker bill. It has soft, brownish-black plumage and long, bristly throat feathers; the feet, legs, and bill are black. Today, the Hawaiian crow is considered the most endangered of the family Corvidae. They are recorded to have lived up to 18 years in the wild, and 28 years in captivity. Some Native Hawaiians consider the Hawaiian crow an &quot;aumakua&quot; (family god).

The species is known for its strong flying ability and resourcefulness, and the reasons for its various extirpations are not fully understood. It is thought that introduced diseases, introduced predators, and habitat loss were probably significant factors in the species&#x27; decline.

==Distribution and habitat==
Before the Hawaiian crow became extinct in the wild, the species was found only in the western and southeastern parts of Hawaii. It inhabited dry and mesic forests on the slopes of Mauna Loa and Hualālai at elevations of 3,000 to 6,000 feet. &quot;Ōhia lehua&quot; (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;) and &quot;koa&quot; (&quot;Acacia koa&quot;) were important tree species in its wild habitat. Extensive understory cover was necessary to protect the ʻalalā from predation by the Hawaiian hawk, or &quot;io&quot; (&quot;Buteo solitarius).&quot; Nesting sites of the ʻalalā received of annual rainfall. Fossil remains indicate that the Hawaiian crow used to be relatively abundant on all the main islands of Hawaii, along with four other now-extinct crow species.

The Hawaiian crow was also preyed on by rats and the small Asian mongooses (&quot;Urva auropunctata&quot;). Feral cats that introduced &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; to the birds can also prey on chicks that are unable to fly. As of 2012, the Hawaiian crow&#x27;s current population is 114 birds, the vast majority of which are in Hawaiian reserves.

==Behavior==

=== Diet ===
The omnivorous Hawaiian crow is a generalist species, eating various foods as they become available. The main portion of their diet and 50% of their feeding activity is spent foraging on trunks, branches, and foliage for invertebrates such as isopods, land snails, and arachnids. They feed in a woodpecker fashion, flaking bark and moss from trunks or branches to expose hidden insects, foraging mostly on ohia and koa, the tallest and most dominant trees in their habitats. Fruits are the second most dominant component in the Hawaiian crow&#x27;s diet. The crows often collect kepau and olapa fruit clusters. Although hoawa and alani fruits have hard outer coverings, crows continue to exert energy prying them open. Passerine Nestlings and eggs are consumed most frequently in April and May, during their breeding season. Other prey include red-billed leiothrix, Japanese white-eye, Hawaiʻi ʻamakihi, ʻIʻiwi, ʻelepaio, and ʻapapane. The alalā also commonly forages on flowers, especially from February through May. Nectar to feed the young is obtained from the ohia flower, oha kepau, and purple poka during the nestling period. Crows also foraged various plant parts, including the flower petals of kolea, koa, and mamane. The palila is the only other Hawaiian bird known to eat flower petals. The alalā only occasionally forages on the ground, but only for a limited amount of time for risk of predators.

=== Tool use ===

Captive individuals can use sticks as tools to extract food from holes drilled in logs. The juveniles exhibit tool use without training or social learning from adults, and it is believed to be a species-wide ability.

===Voice===
The Hawaiian crow has a call described variously as a two-toned &quot;caw&quot; and as a screech with lower tones added, similar to a cat&#x27;s &quot;meow&quot;. In flight, this species has been known to produce a wide variety of calls including a repeated kerruk, kerruk sound and a loud kraa-a-a-ik sound. It also makes a ca-wk sound, has a complex, burbling song, and makes a variety of other sounds as well. The alalā has at least 24 calls in its repertoire, including alarm calls, contact calls, and calls signifying submission or courtship.

This is a medley of the different calls the Hawaiian Crow makes.

=== Breeding and reproduction ===
Female crows are considered sexually mature at about 2 or 3 years of age and males at 4 years. The Hawaiian crow&#x27;s breeding season lasts from March to July; it builds a nest in March or April, lays eggs in mid-to-late April, and the eggs hatch in mid-May. Both sexes construct nests with branches from the native ohi&#x27;a tree strengthened with grasses. The crow typically lays one to five eggs (that are greenish-blue in color) per season, although at most only two will survive past the fledgling phase. Only the females incubate the 2–5 eggs for 19–22 days and brood the young, of which only 1–2 fledge about 40 days after hatching. If the first clutch is lost, the pair will re-lay, which serves to be helpful in captive breeding efforts. Juveniles rely on their parents for 8 months and will stay with the family group until the next breeding season.

== Environmental role ==
The alalā was one of the largest native bird populations in Hawaii. Its disappearance in the wild has had cascading effects on the environment, especially with the seed dispersal of the native plants. Many of these plants rely on the alalā not only for seed dispersal but also for seed germination as seeds are passed through the crow&#x27;s digestive system. Without seed dispersal, the plants have no means of growing another generation. The alalā plays a key role in the maintenance of many indigenous plant species, which now could become a rarity in Hawaii&#x27;s ecosystems, specifically the dry forests, without their main seed disperser. The Hawaiian crow has become known as an indicator species; the disappearance of the alalā indicates serious environmental problems.
== Primary threats ==
The Hawaiian crow faces an ample number of threats in the wild, which are considered contributing factors to their extinction in the wild. Small population size makes the species more vulnerable to environmental fluctuations; this leads to a higher likelihood of inbreeding, which reduces the likelihood that offspring will survive to recruitment.

=== Habitat loss and hunting ===
Alalā select habitat with ample cover and prefer areas with a large proportion of native plants for food and shelter. Polynesian and European farmers removed dry, lowland forest, restricting the alalā to forest at higher elevation. After settlement by Europeans, the higher elevation forest was also compromised by extensive logging and ranching, and farm animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats being allowed to graze freely in these areas.

Ancient Polynesian cultures valued alalā feathers for use in &quot;kāhili&quot; and for decorating idols used during the Makahiki season. For this purpose, professional birdcatchers (known as &quot;kia manu&quot;) working for King Kamehameha or local priests (&quot;ali&#x27;i&quot;) were known to snare and hunt alalā with poles.

Alalā were also shot for sport by European colonizers. Though hunting native birds was illegal at the time, alalā continued to be shot throughout the 1980s, according to conservationists.

=== Introduced predators ===
The alalā&#x27;s known extant natural predator is the &#x27;io (Hawaiian hawk), a hawk species endemic to Hawaii.

Several mammal species introduced to Hawaii by humans are known to prey on alalā eggs, nestlings, and fledglings. These include the roof rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;), the small Indian mongoose, and feral cats, which have been known to attack nests, eat eggs, and kill young fledglings.

=== Introduced diseases ===

==== Avian malaria ====
Avian malaria is a parasitic disease of birds, caused by &quot;Plasmodium relictum,&quot; a protozoan parasite passed to birds via mosquitoes of the species &quot;Culex quinquefasciatus&quot;, which was introduced to the Hawaiian islands in 1826. Though this disease appears in many passerine birds without much population impact, many isolated bird populations show significant mortality when introduced to this parasite, including native Hawaiian birds. Many Hawaiian bird species have shown precipitous population declines which are thought to be due to avian malaria. Though there is no direct evidence implicating avian malaria in the decline of the alalā, they are vulnerable to the disease. Seven captive alalā, housed in outdoor aviaries, were naturally infected with avian malaria over the course of a seven-week study, and two of those infected showed clinical signs of the illness.

==== Avian pox ====
Avian pox is an infection caused by viruses in the genus &quot;Avipoxvirus&quot;. Infection causes tumor-like lesions on the exposed skin of the legs and feet and in and around the beak, trachea, and esophagus. Avian pox is also spread by mosquitos, and through contact with infected birds or objects. In experimental studies on other native Hawaiian birds, avian pox has been shown to cause large lesions, which often become infected, leading to tissue necrosis. Infections can sometimes lead to death. Alalā have been known to become infected with avian pox, including during reintroduction efforts, but the role, if any, of the disease in their decline is unknown.

==== Toxoplasmosis ====
Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by the protozoan &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. It is spread by domestic cats, who can transmit eggs and parasites to practically every known warm-blooded vertebrate, including birds, in their feces. Though toxoplasmosis rarely causes disease and death in infected animals, infection was diagnosed in five reintroduced alalā in 1998–1999. One presented with clinical signs and was successfully treated, three appeared to have died from the disease, and one was diagnosed but did not appear to show clinical signs of the disease. During reintroduction efforts between 2016–2020, several birds showed evidence in blood samples that they had had prior toxoplasmosis infections, though no birds tested positive for active infections. Cats are not native to the Hawaiian islands, and alalā are therefore naive hosts to the parasite; this is often associated with higher virulence and susceptibility. Whether or not toxoplasmosis has contributed to historic declines of alalā is unknown; however, it has been a consideration in conservation efforts for the species.

==Status and conservation==

The Hawaiian crow is the most endangered corvid species in the world and the only corvid species left in Hawaii. Like other critically endangered species, harming the Hawaiian crow is illegal under U.S. federal law. By 1994, the overall population had dwindled to 31 individuals; 8 to 12 were wild and 19 held in captivity. The only wild-born juvenile produced between 1992–2003 was last seen in 1997. The last two known wild individuals of the Hawaiian crow disappeared in 2002, and the species is now classified as Extinct in the Wild by the IUCN Red List. Some 115 individuals remain (as of August 2014) in two captive breeding facilities operated by the San Diego Zoo. Attempts to reintroduce captive-bred birds into the wild have been hampered by predation by the Hawaiian hawk (&quot;Buteo solitarius&quot;), which itself is listed as Near Threatened. Breeding efforts have also been complicated due to extensive inbreeding during the crow&#x27;s population decline.

=== Protection ===
The alalā has been legally protected by the state of Hawaii since 1931 and was recognized as federally endangered in 1967. Sites on the slopes of Mauna Loa and other natural ranges have been set aside for habitat reconstruction and native bird recovery since the 1990s. The Kūlani Keauhou area has been ranked the best spot for the crows, parts of which have been fenced and ungulate-free for 20 years, helping tremendously for habitat recovery.

==== Captive breeding efforts ====
The first alalā to be brought into captivity were two fledglings infected with avian pox in the wild in 1970 so they could receive treatment. By 1981, 12 individuals had been brought into captivity due to concerns about the viability of the wild population; 10 were housed in an endangered species breeding facility on Hawaii island. In 1986, the remaining captive alalā were transferred to a breeding facility on Maui. In 1996, a new captive breeding facility was completed near Volcano on Hawaii- the captive population of alalā was thereafter split between these two sites. In 2000, management of both captive breeding centers was taken over by San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.

Initially, a majority of efforts to breed alalā proved unsuccessful. Between 1979 and 1991, 33 unbroken, fertile eggs were produced in captivity, but only 8 chicks hatched. Difficulties with artificial incubation, issues with males disturbing nesting females, and problems associated with inbreeding, are all thought to have contributed to this low number. Because few chicks were produced each year and to prevent harm to the chicks from inept parents, birds were sometimes hand-reared without any siblings nearby. These individuals grew up to exhibit more stereotypies, a negative indicator for breeding success and fitness for release in the wild.

Over time, captive breeding has become more successful; the captive population increased from 24 in 1999 to more than 100 in 2012 with improved incubation, housing, and hand-rearing techniques. With more birds in the population, practitioners are now focused on increasing the population while simultaneously producing offspring more suited to release into the wild. This is achieved by socializing breeding pairs to encourage strong pair bonding, providing options of nest-building locations and materials, encouraging females to incubate eggs to hatch, and allowing parents to rear their own chicks to adulthood. Experimentation with allowing adults to incubate and rear their own chicks began in 2011, and by 2023, 17% of the living population was the product of full parent-rearing.

==== Reintroduction ====
There have been multiple attempted reintroductions of the alalā.

Between 1993 and 1998, 27 juvenile alalā, from eggs of both wild and captive origin, were raised in captivity and released on South Kona, Hawaii, near the remaining wild population. 21 of the 27 released birds died over the course of the program, many before reaching sexual maturity. The mortality rate of the reintroduced population was about twice that of the wild population at the time. The cause of death was determined for 13 of the 21 deceased birds- 7 were killed by Hawaiian hawks (&#x27;io), 3 died of toxoplasmosis infection, 2 died of other infections, and 1 was killed by nonnative mammal predation. In 1998 and 1999, the remaining 6 birds were recaptured and reintegrated into the captive flock.

In December 2016, 5 young alalā were released into the Pu&#x27;u Maka&#x27;ala Natural Area Reserve on the eastern side of the island of Hawai&#x27;i. By mid-January, 3 birds had been found dead and the remaining 2 were returned to captivity. Necropsies found that 2 of the deaths were likely due to predation by the Hawaiian hawk and 1 was due to natural circumstances stemming from poor body condition.

A program of improved predator training was implemented in response to the previous deaths, and between 2017–2019, 27 young alalā were released in the Pu&#x27;u Maka&#x27;ala Natural Area Reserve in 3 separate release cohorts. Though all birds released in 2017 and 2018 survived for over a year, birds released in 2019 survived for a shorter period- most died within 5 months of their release. Accelerating mortality into 2020 caused practitioners to recapture and return 5 surviving alalā to captivity. 7 deaths were likely caused by Hawaiian hawk predation, 3 from poor condition, 2 by intraspecific aggression, and 1 by nonnative mammal predation.

In contrast to the reintroduction efforts during the 1990s, some birds released in the 2010s showed breeding behavior in the wild, though it was ultimately unsuccessful. In May 2019, one pair built a nest, laid eggs inside, and incubated them. However, the eggs never hatched and were presumed infertile. Another pair exhibited nest-building behavior, but did not succeed in building a full nest.

As of February 2024, plans are underway to release alalā on Maui, aiming for releases to begin in spring of 2024. Although alalā were known historically to exist only on the island of Hawaii, subfossil evidence has shown that alalā were found on Maui as recently as when humans began occupying the Hawaiian Islands. Because Maui has a similar landscape and plants to Hawaii but does not have any Hawaiian hawks, it is thought that alalā may be able to survive on Maui without a threat which caused the majority of deaths in prior reintroductions.

On December 4, 2024, two females and three males were reintroduced to Maui.

== Cultural significance ==
The Hawaiian crow is a significant symbol in Hawaiian mythology. It is said to lead souls to their final resting place on the cliffs of Ka Lae, the southernmost tip on the Big Island of Hawaii. Native priests named the ʻalalā so during prayer and chants due to its distinctive call.

<text>Paul Émile de Puydt (6 March 1810 – 20 May 1891), a writer whose contributions included work in botany and economics, was born and died in Mons, Belgium. His father was Jean Ambroise de Puydt (1758–1836), who was governor of the province Hainaut in the early days of Belgium from 1830 till 1834. In the first marriage of his father there were 6 children. The famous Remi de Puydt came from this first marriage. He is a half brother of Paul Émile de Puydt. Remi de Puydt was a civil engineer and a politician (representative), and he served in the Belgian army as a colonel.

==Biography==
Paul-Émile was the second child of four children from the second marriage of his father, who married in 1799 Marie Adélaïde Jeanne Michot (c. 1777 – 1858). As a botanist, Paul Émile de Puydt notably wrote on orchids. The standard botanical author abbreviation De Puydt is applied to species he described.

After his studies, he turned to journalism and worked as an editor of &quot;L&#x27;Observateur du Hainaut&quot;. 
Together with Henri-Florent Delmotte and Hippolyte Rousselle, he wrote in 1831, the year when the current Belgium became separated from the northern Netherlands, the theatre piece &quot;Le candidat à la royauté: esquisse en trois tableaux mêlés de couplets&quot;. This play was performed in Mons in 1831. 
He then participated in the government, and he was also director of the Mont-de-piété of Mons.

In his free time he was interested in botany, and he developed a pronounced interest in orchids.
Since 1831 he was secretary of the founded &quot;societé d&#x27;horticulture de Mons&quot;. In 1833 he worked on the foundation of the Societé des arts et des lettres du Hainaut, where he was vice-president and, from 1865 onwards, president.

Paul-Émile de Puydt married in 1841 Fanie Catherine Cousin (1819–1905). They had two children: Julien-Vincent-Émile de Puydt (1842–1921) and Philippine-Therese-Marie de Puydt (1843–1892).

As a political economist, he is known as inventor of the concept of people having the freedom to choose which government to join, and governments having to compete for citizens. He has given the name &quot;panarchy&quot; to this concept. His paper &quot;Panarchie&quot; was first published in French in the Revue Trimestrielle, in Brussels, July 1860. Panarchie and its author Paul Emile de Puydt was only recently rediscovered.
The notion of competitive government, but then limited to defence, can also be found in the writings of the Belgian economist Gustave de Molinari from 1849, eleven years before de Puydt.
David Hart of the Department of History of Stanford University suggests that Paul-Émile de Puydt might have been influenced by the works of his fellow countryman Gustave de Molinari.

== Panarchy ==
In an 1860 article, de Puydt first proposed the idea of panarchy: a political philosophy that emphasizes each individual&#x27;s right to freely choose (join and leave) the jurisdiction of any governments they choose, without being forced to move from their current locale. A proponent of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics, he wrote that &quot;governmental competition&quot; would let &quot;as many regularly competing governments as have ever been conceived and will ever be invented&quot; exist simultaneously and detailed how such a system would be implemented. As David M. Hart writes: &quot;Governments would become political churches, only having jurisdiction over their congregations who had elected to become members.&quot; Three similar ideas are &quot;Functional Overlapping Competing Jurisdictions&quot; (FOCJ) advocated by Swiss economists Bruno Frey and Reiner Eichenberger, &quot;multigovernment&quot; advocated by Le Grand E. Day and others, and &quot;meta-utopia&quot; from Robert Nozick&#x27;s &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;.

<text>Cornelius &quot;Sonny&quot; Fortune (May 19, 1939 – October 25, 2018) was an American jazz saxophonist. He played soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones, clarinet, and flute.

==Biography==
He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. After moving to New York City in 1967, Fortune recorded and appeared live with drummer Elvin Jones&#x27;s group. In 1968, he was a member of Mongo Santamaría&#x27;s band. He performed with singer Leon Thomas, and with pianist McCoy Tyner (1971–73). In 1974, Fortune replaced Dave Liebman in Miles Davis&#x27;s ensemble, remaining until spring 1975, when he was succeeded by Sam Morrison. Fortune can be heard on the albums &quot;Big Fun&quot;, &quot;Get Up With It&quot;, &quot;Agharta&quot;, and &quot;Pangaea&quot;, the last two recorded live in Japan.

Fortune joined Nat Adderley after his brief tenure with Davis, then formed his own group in June 1975, recording two albums for the Horizon Records. During the 1990s, he recorded several albums for Blue Note. He has also performed with Roy Brooks, Buddy Rich, George Benson, Rabih Abou Khalil, Roy Ayers, Oliver Nelson, Gary Bartz, Rashied Ali, and Pharoah Sanders, as well as appearing on the live album &quot;The Atlantic Family Live at Montreux&quot; (1977).

Fortune died of a stroke at the age of 79 in October 2018.
