<text>Trans-Europe Express () is the sixth studio album by German band Kraftwerk. Recorded in 1976 in Düsseldorf, Germany, the album was released in March 1977 on Kling Klang Records. It saw the group refine their melodic electronic style, with a focus on sequenced rhythms, minimalism, and occasionally manipulated vocals. The themes include celebrations of the titular European railway service and Europe as a whole, and meditations on the disparities between reality and appearance.

&quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; charted at 119 on the American charts and was ranked number 30 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1977 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. Two singles were released: &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; and &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot;. The album has been re-released in several formats and continues to receive acclaim as one of the best albums of the 1970s and of all time. In 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;the most important pop album of the last 40 years&quot;.

==Background==

After the release and tour for the album &quot;Radio-Activity&quot;, Kraftwerk continued to move further away from their earlier krautrock style of improvised instrumental music, refining their work more into the format of melodic electronic songs. During the tour for &quot;Radio-Activity&quot;, the band began to make performance rules such as not to be drunk on stage or at parties. Karl Bartos wrote about these rules, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s not easy to turn knobs on a synthesizer if you are drunk or full of drugs. ... We always tried to keep very aware of what we were doing while acting in public.&quot; During this tour, early melodies that would later evolve into the song &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; were being performed.

In mid-1976, Kraftwerk began to work on the album which was then called &quot;Europe Endless&quot;. Paul Alessandrini suggested that Kraftwerk write a song about the Trans Europ Express to reflect their electronic music style. Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider met with musicians David Bowie and Iggy Pop prior to the recording, which influenced song lyrics. Maxime Schmitt encouraged the group to record a French language version of the song &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot;, which led the group to later record several songs in French. The album was recorded at Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf. Artistic control over the songs was strictly in the hands of members Hütter and Schneider, with Bartos and Wolfgang Flür contributing sequenced electronic percussion. Kraftwerk went to railway bridges to listen to the sounds the train would actually produce. The group found the sound the train made was not danceable and changed it slightly.

==Recording==
An important piece of new equipment used on the album was the Synthanorma Sequenzer, a customized 32-step 16-channel analog sequencer made for the band by Matten &amp; Wiechers. This allowed the construction of more elaborate sequenced synthesizer lines, which are featured prominently in the tracks &quot;Franz Schubert&quot; and &quot;Endless Endless&quot;, and liberated the player from the chore of playing repetitive keyboard patterns.

Whereas &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; had featured a mixture of German and English lyrics throughout the album, &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; went further and was mixed as two entirely separate versions, one sung in English, the other in German. At the recommendation of Maxime Schmitt, a French version of the song &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot;, titled &quot;Les Mannequins&quot;, was also recorded. &quot;Les Mannequins&quot; was the group&#x27;s first song in French and would influence decisions to record songs in French on later albums. After recording the album in Düsseldorf, Hütter and Schneider visited Los Angeles to mix the tracks at the Record Plant Studio. Elements of the mixing sessions that were done in Los Angeles were dropped from the album, including the use of more upfront vocals in order to do more mixing in Düsseldorf and Hamburg later.

== Artwork ==
The artwork for the album cover of &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; was originally going to be a monochrome picture of the group reflected in a series of mirrors. This idea was dropped for a photo by New York-based celebrity photographer Maurice Seymour, with the group dressed in suits to resemble mannequins. J. Stara&#x27;s image of the group was taken in Paris and is a highly retouched photo-montage of Kraftwerk from their shoulders up again posed as mannequins which are shown on the cover of the English version of the album. On the inside sleeve, a color collage of the group sitting at a small cafe table designed by Emil Schult was used. The photo for this scene was from the session by Maurice Seymour, taken on the group&#x27;s American tour. Other photos were taken by Schult that show the group laughing and smiling. These were not used for the album&#x27;s release.

==Composition==
Wolfgang Flür has stated Kraftwerk were influenced by the music of the Weimar Germany era: &quot;we were children who were born straight after World War Two... we had no musical or pop culture of our own... there was the war, and before the war we had only the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from&quot;. Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they &quot;had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong and it all happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there.&quot; Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album&#x27;s concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that &quot;with the kind of music you do, which is kind of like an electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express&quot;. Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as &quot;Autobahn&quot; inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans-Europe Express could be used to symbolize this. AllMusic referred to &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; and &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot;, and the others about the glorification of Europe. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the album as &quot;a sonic poem to Europe&quot;.

The musical style of &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; was described by AllMusic as melodic themes which are &quot;repeated often and occasionally interwoven over deliberate, chugging beats, sometimes with manipulated vocals&quot; and &quot;minimalism, mechanized rhythms, and crafted, catchy melodies&quot;. The music has been categorized as electronic pop, synth-pop, and experimental pop. Hütter has commented on the minimalist nature of the album, stating that &quot;If we can convey an idea with one or two notes, it is better than to play a hundred or so notes&quot;. The first side of &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; has three songs. The song &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; has been described as containing deadpan vocals with lyrics that speculate how stars look at themselves in a looking glass. Hütter and Schneider have described the song as autobiographical. The third track &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; was described by AllMusic as &quot;bouncily melodic in a way that most of &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; isn&#x27;t&quot; and with lyrics which are &quot;slightly paranoid&quot;. The idea for the song came from Flür and Bartos being compared to showroom dummies in a British concert review. Some versions of the song contain a spoken introduction starting with a count-in of &quot;eins zwei drei vier&quot; as a parody of the band Ramones who started some songs with a quick count-in of &quot;one two three four&quot;. The second side of &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; is a suite with &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; continuing through to &quot;Metal on Metal&quot; and &quot;Franz Schubert&quot; before closing with a brief reiteration of the main theme from &quot;Europe Endless&quot;. AllMusic described the musical elements of the suite as having a haunting theme with &quot;deadpan chanting of the title phrase&quot; which is &quot;slowly layered over that rhythmic base in much the same way that the earlier &quot;Autobahn&quot; was constructed&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics reference the album &quot;Station to Station&quot; and meeting with musicians Iggy Pop and David Bowie. Hütter and Schneider had previously met up with Bowie in Germany and were flattered by the attention they received from him. Ralf Hütter was interested in Bowie&#x27;s work as he had been working with Iggy Pop, who was the former lead singer of The Stooges; one of Hütter&#x27;s favorite groups.

==Release==
&quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; was originally released in March 1977. With the help of Günther Fröhling, Kraftwerk made a promotional music video for the song &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;. The video features the group wearing long coats on a train trip from Düsseldorf to nearby Duisburg. Photo stills from this video were later used on the single sleeve for &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot;. Fröhling would work with Kraftwerk again on their album &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; doing the photography for the album cover. To promote the album to the press in France, EMI Records hired a train with old-fashioned carriages from the 1930s to travel from Paris to Rheims while the songs from the album were played over the train&#x27;s announcement system for the critics.

In October 2009, a remastered edition of the album was released by EMI in Germany, Mute Records in the European Union and Astralwerks in the United States. This re-release was available on compact disc, digital download, and vinyl and features a different album cover from previous versions of the album. This new version features a black background with a white Trans Europ Express train in the center. The track listing on the 2009 re-release amends the titles of the songs to match the original German release. This change has &quot;Metal on Metal&quot; being credited for two minutes of the music with the remainder being a track titled &quot;Abzug&quot; (English: &quot;Departure&quot;).

==Critical reception==
Initial reviews for &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; were positive. Music critic Robert Christgau, in a review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, wrote that the album&#x27;s &quot;textural effects sound like parodies by some cosmic schoolboy of every lush synthesizer surge that&#x27;s ever stuck in your gullet—yet also work the way those surges are supposed to work&quot;. &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; placed at number 30 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s 1977 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

Modern reception has been very favorable. &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; has the highest possible ratings from publications including AllMusic, &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that the album &quot;is often cited as perhaps the archetypal (and most accessible) Kraftwerk album ... Overall, &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; offers the best blend of minimalism, mechanized rhythms, and crafted, catchy melodies in the group&#x27;s catalog&quot;. &quot;Q&quot;, in a 1995 review, wrote that the album &quot;changed the face of American dance music&quot; and was &quot;one of the most compelling beats of this or any other era&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;″s Chris Power stated that &quot;&quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; is all at once antique, timeless, retro and contemporary. Its status as modern electronic music&#x27;s birth certificate is well-earned, but its hallowed reputation should never be allowed to disguise its true value and power as a work of art. Nor should it obscure a longevity that, 32 years on, we might as well start calling by its real name: immortality&quot;.

&quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; has also appeared on top album lists from a variety of sources. In 2001, TV network VH1 placed &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; at number 56 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Albums (of Rock &amp; Roll) of All Time&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; placed the album at number one on their list of the greatest electronic albums of the 20th century. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album at number 253 on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, with the ranking dropping to number 256 in a 2012 revision and climbing to number 238 in the 2020 reboot of the list. Channel 4 placed the album at number 71 on their list of the 100 greatest albums. In 2004, the online music website &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; as 6th best album of the 1970s, stating that &quot;the day will soon come, if it hasn&#x27;t already, that &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; joins the ranks of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; as a record that simply cannot be written about&quot;. 2014, pop music critic Randall Roberts wrote in the Los Angeles Times that the record was the most important of the last forty years.

===Legacy===
Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the album&#x27;s influence as &quot;unprecedented, reaching as wide as rock (Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Kid A&quot;), hip-hop (Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s classic &#x27;Planet Rock&#x27;, Jay Dee&#x27;s recent &#x27;Big Booty Express&#x27;) and pop (Madonna&#x27;s Drowned World Tour, which incorporated samples of &#x27;Metal on Metal&#x27;)&quot;.

In the late 1970s, the album influenced post-punk band Joy Division; bassist Peter Hook related: &quot;We were introduced to Kraftwerk by [singer] Ian Curtis, who insisted we play &quot;Trans Europe Express&quot; before we went on stage every time. The tape was played at the venue over the PA system, to be heard by everyone. The first time was Pips [a Manchester club well known for its &#x27;Bowie Room&#x27;]. Ian got thrown out for kicking glass around the dance floor in time to the track. It took us ages of pleading to get him back in.&quot; Drummer Stephen Morris also confirmed that Joy Division &quot;used to play &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; before we went on stage, to get us into the zone. It worked because it gets up a lot of momentum. &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; just seemed to express an optimism even if people see it as machine music&quot;. Morris also said: &quot;It reminds me of &quot;Cabaret&quot;, the film, with all of the 1920s singing. ... When you get that marriage between humans and machines, and you get it right, it&#x27;s fantastic. I have to say it&#x27;s my favourite Kraftwerk album.&quot; In the mid-1980s, Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; rendition of &quot;The Hall of Mirrors&quot;, on their album &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, was one of the few cover versions that Ralf Hütter hailed in glowing terms as &quot;extraordinary&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Commercial performance==
&quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; charted higher in the United States than Kraftwerk&#x27;s previous album &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; by peaking at number 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart.
&quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; and &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; were released as singles from the album. &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1977 where it peaked at number 67. &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; began charting in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The album entered the charts on 6 February 1982, staying in the charts for seven weeks and peaking at number 49. The re-released single for &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; (a remix with additional drums) entered the charts on 20 February 1982, staying on the charts for five weeks and peaking at number 25.

==Track listing==

Notes
* While &quot;Abzug&quot; (English meaning &quot;trigger&quot; or &quot;departure&quot;) appeared originally as a separate track on all pressings of &quot;Trans Europa Express&quot;, later releases of &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; combined &quot;Abzug&quot; and &quot;Metal on Metal&quot; together under the latter track&#x27;s title, at a running time of 6:52. On both 2009 reissues of &quot;Trans Europa Express&quot; and &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;, however, &quot;Abzug&quot; is presented as a separate track.

<text>John Caldwell Holt (April 14, 1923 – September 14, 1985) was an American author and educator, a proponent of homeschooling (specifically the unschooling approach), and a pioneer in youth rights theory.

After a six-year stint teaching elementary school in the 1950s, Holt wrote the book &quot;How Children Fail&quot; (1964), which cataloged the problems he saw with the American school system. He followed it up with &quot;How Children Learn&quot; (1967). Both books were popular, and they started Holt&#x27;s career as a consultant to American schools. By the 1970s he decided he would try reforming the school system and began to advocate homeschooling and, later, the form of homeschooling known as &quot;unschooling&quot;. He wrote a total of 11 books on the subject of schooling as well as starting the newsletter &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; (&quot;GWS&quot;).

== Early life ==
Holt was born on April 14, 1923, in New York City; he had two younger sisters. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy, then attended Yale University, graduating in 1943 with a degree in Industrial Engineering. Directly after graduating he enlisted with the United States Navy, and served in World War II on the submarine USS &quot;Barbero&quot;. He was discharged in 1946, then joined the United World Federalists, an organization that promoted world peace through the formation of a single world government. He rose up the ranks of the organization, and served as the executive director of the group&#x27;s New York State chapter when he left in 1952 due to frustration with the organization&#x27;s lack of progress.

== Teaching career ==
Holt&#x27;s sister encouraged him to become an elementary school teacher, and in 1953 he began teaching at the newly-formed Colorado Rocky Mountain School, a private school in Carbondale, Colorado. In 1957 and 1958 he taught at the Shady Hill School, a private elementary and middle school in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1959 he taught fifth grade at the Lesley Ellis School, also in Cambridge.

While teaching, Holt came to the belief that the students in his classroom, despite often being intelligent and from wealthy backgrounds, were more timid and unsure than the infant and toddler children of his sisters and friends.

== From homeschooling to unschooling ==
Holt became disillusioned with the school system after several years of working within it; he became convinced that reform of the school system was not possible and began to advocate homeschooling. He believed that &quot;children who were provided with a rich and stimulating learning environment would learn what they are ready to learn, when they are ready to learn it&quot;.
Holt believed that children did not need to be coerced into learning; they would do so naturally if given the freedom to follow their own interests and a rich assortment of resources. This line of thought came to be called unschooling.

Holt&#x27;s &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; newsletter, founded in 1977, was America&#x27;s first home education newsletter. He also set up John Holt&#x27;s Bookstore, which made selected books available by mail order. This brought in additional revenue that helped sustain the newsletter, which carried very little advertising.

Holt&#x27;s sole book on homeschooling, &quot;Teach Your Own&quot;, was published in 1981. It quickly became the &quot;Bible&quot; of the early homeschooling movement. It was revised by his colleague Patrick Farenga and republished in 2003 by Perseus Books.

== Holt on education ==

Holt wrote several books that have greatly influenced the unschooling movement. His writings have influenced many individuals and organizations, including the Evergreen State College, Caleb Gattegno, Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions, the National Youth Rights Association, and the Freechild Project.

Holt did not have a teaching degree, which many believe allowed for his work in the private school sector to make way for him to have a more objective opinion on the American school system. Being new to the environment, it is thought that he was able to make more objective distinctions than other educators as to what the schools said they were doing and what they were actually doing. For the first many years of his teaching career, he maintained the belief that schools overall were not meeting their missions due to using the wrong methods and pedagogical approaches, and that these failures were the cause for rendering young scholars as children who were less willing to learn and more focused on avoiding the embarrassment and ridicule of not learning.

As Holt wrote in his first book, &quot;How Children Fail&quot; (1964) &quot;...after all, if they (meaning us) know that you can&#x27;t do anything, then they won&#x27;t blame you or punish you for not being able to do what you have been told to do.&quot; This notion led him to make changes within his own classroom to provide an environment in which his students would feel more comfortable and confident. With the support of his colleague Bill Hull, Holt began putting less emphasis on grades and tests, and began taking steps to decrease the notion of ranking the children. He focused on his students being able to grasp concepts, rather than having them work for the correct answer. Instead of using the typical methods to determine students&#x27; progress, he adopted a more student-centered approach. Patrick Farenga paraphrased Holt&#x27;s distinction between good and bad students: &quot;a good student is careful not to forget what he studied until after the test is taken.&quot; Eventually, his new methods for teaching caused him to be terminated from his position, which he claimed was due to the school wanting to maintain &quot;old &#x27;new&#x27; ideas not new &#x27;new&#x27; ideas.&quot;

After leaving Colorado, Holt sought other opportunities in education. Although it took him some time to come to a conclusion about his own thoughts on education as well as make sense of his observations, studies, and data, ultimately he felt that schools were &quot;a place where children learn to be stupid.&quot; Once he developed this conclusion, his focus shifted to making suggestions to help teachers and parents capable of teaching their children how to learn, thus prompting his second book, &quot;How Children Learn&quot;, in 1967. Despite his successful career, he still met rejections, resentment, and false hopes from colleagues and school systems surrounding his ideas and methods. This reality pushed him further and further into the idea of deschooling.

After a few more years of teaching and some visiting professor positions at area universities, Holt wrote his next two books, &quot;The Underachieving School&quot; (1969) and &quot;What Do I Do Monday?&quot; (1970). Both books focused on his belief that schools weren&#x27;t working and ideas about how they could be better. Holt had determined by this time that the changes he would like to see happen in the school systems were not likely to become a reality. These changes included the relationship between children and the teachers and school community. At this point in the history of education, the free school movement was in full swing, and his next book, &quot;Freedom and Beyond&quot; (1972), questioned much of what teachers and educators really meant when they suggested children should have more freedom in the classroom. While Holt was an advocate of children having more rights and abilities to make decisions for themselves, he felt that the free school movement was not the answer to the question of how to fix the school system.

Holt then wrote &quot;Escape from Childhood: The Needs and Rights of Children&quot; (1974), in which he claimed that children should have independence including the right to work for money, receive fair and equal treatment, the right to vote, and even the right to choose new parents. At the time, his notions of children having so many rights and responsibilities was not very popular, but since then the court systems have seen more and more cases of children attempting to realise many of Holt&#x27;s suggestions, such as choosing their legal guardian.

Although many of Holt&#x27;s previous works had discussed the needed reform and failure of the traditional school system, his seventh book, &quot;Instead of Education: Ways to Help People do Better&quot; (1976), focused more on his encouragement that parents find legal ways to remove their children from compulsory schools. Specifically, he referred to an Underground Railroad in which schoolchildren could escape the failing school systems of which he had been so critical. The book caused a number of parents to reach out to him regarding their own homeschooling of their children. This correspondence grew so much that he decided to start a newsletter for homeschooling parents. In 1977 &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; was developed and distributed. It is thought that this newsletter is the first published periodical regarding homeschooling in the United States.

Holt&#x27;s focus began to switch from critiquing school systems and writing from afar to speaking engagements and educating adults on how they can teach their children while learning themselves. His next book, &quot;Never Too Late: My Musical Autobiography&quot; (1978), focused on showing adults that they were not too old to learn new things. This was translated into ways in which parents who had no experience in education could learn to teach their children on their own in a homeschooling setting.

In 1981, the first edition of Holt&#x27;s most noteworthy book on unschooling, &quot;Teach Your Own: The John Holt Manual on Homeschooling&quot;, was published. This book, as noted in the first lines of the introduction, is &quot;about ways we can teach children, or rather, allow them to learn, outside of schools—at home, or in whatever other places and situations (and the more the better) we can make available to them. It is in part an argument in favor of doing it, in part a report of the people who are doing it, and in part a manual of action for people who want to do it.&quot; This manual has since been revised by Holt follower and homeschooling parent Patrick Farenga, and is still distributed today.

Even after his death in 1985, Holt&#x27;s influence on homeschooling continued through his work. His final book, &quot;Learning All the Time: How Small Children Begin to Read, Write, Count and Investigate the World, Without Being Taught&quot;, was published posthumously in 1989. It contained a number of his writings for &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;. The &quot;GWS&quot;&#x27; newsletter has since garnered followings in a number of different countries and has been continuously distributed since its inception as a tool for the promotion and encouragement of homeschooling in light of the lack of school system reform.

<doc id="216749" wikidata="Q1753914" url="?curid=216749" title="Saliva (band)">
<text>Saliva is an American rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1996. Saliva released their self-titled debut album in 1997 through Rockingchair Records, a label owned and operated by Mark Yoshida. The release was recorded and produced by Bill Pappas at Rockingchair Studios.

They were signed to Island Records and went on to release their second studio album &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot;. Saliva later released their third studio album titled &quot;Back into Your System&quot; in 2002, which reached No. 19 on the Billboard 200. &quot;Back into Your System&quot; launched one of Saliva&#x27;s most successful songs, &quot;Always&quot;, reaching No. 51 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Modern Rock Chart. Three years after &quot;Survival of the Sickest&quot;, Saliva released &quot;Blood Stained Love Story&quot; in 2007, repeating &quot;Back into Your System&quot;″s chart performance at No. 19 on the Billboard 200. Its first single, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen&quot;, peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. Their most well known lineup, which lasted from 2000-2005, consisted of Josey Scott, Wayne Swinny, Chris D&#x27;Abaldo, Dave Novotny, and Paul Crosby.

The band is known for having their songs played at sporting events, especially WWE. The band&#x27;s guitarist Wayne Swinny said, &quot;a lot of our songs, whether they were intended that way or not - most of them weren&#x27;t - they just lend themselves to sporting events. You can&#x27;t watch a football game or go to a football game and not hear &#x27;Click Click Boom,&#x27; &#x27;Ladies and Gentlemen&#x27;.&quot;

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Saliva&quot; (1996–1999)===
Saliva was founded in Bartlett, Tennessee (a suburb of Memphis, Tennessee) in September 1996 by former members of local bands Roxy Blue, Blackbone and Gemini Clan. The original line-up featured vocalist Josey Scott Sappington, drummer Todd Poole, bassist Dave Novotny and guitarists Chris D&#x27;Abaldo and Wayne Swinny. The band played their first show on Halloween, October 31, 1996 with Sappington dressed in a nun costume and Novotny dressed in a voodoo costume.

In December 1996, only four months after forming, the band hastily recorded a demo tape, on the basis of which they were selected, out of 117 local bands, to perform at the second annual Grammy Showcase National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; local competition. The band barely had time to finish mixing the tracks of their demo tape at Rockingchair Recording Studios in order to submit their application before the deadline. The local showcase had Saliva perform alongside four other Tennessee and Arkansas bands (DDT Big Band, Mash-o-Matic, Straight Up Buzz and Ashtray Babyhead) on January 24, 1997 at Memphis&#x27; New Daisy Tavern. Saliva ranked first place at the local showcase and advanced to the regional showcase held in Austin, Texas on February 7, 1997. Their demo tape had since been re-mixed with a better production and the song &quot;Suffocate&quot; was included on the &quot;1997 Grammy Showcase&quot; Various Artists compact disc compilation, released through Grammy Recordings, alongside the eleven other bands with whom they would be competing in the regional showcases.

Saliva again won first place in the regional showcase and they advanced to the national finals, held in New York City on February 22, 1997, competing against the other two regional finalists: folk trio Maggi, Pierce, and EJ and rock band Save Ferris. Saliva came in second behind Save Ferris, but still received worthy consolation prizes including money, equipment and tickets to 1997&#x27;s 39th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. By this point, Saliva had only played a total of six concerts, but they began to be courted by major record label A&amp;R scouts.

The band was nominated for Best Newcomer at the 12th Annual Premier Player Awards, the local Memphis edition of the Grammy Awards, held at The Peabody&#x27;s Memphis Ballroom on April 16, 1997. Saliva also appeared at Memphis&#x27; Crossroads &#x27;97 music exhibition as part of Memphis in May&#x27;s Beale Street Music Festival showcase on May 2, 1997.

In the spring and summer of 1997, Saliva returned to Rockingchair Recording Studios in Memphis to record additional songs with producers Bill Pappas and Mark Yoshida, which were combined with the re-mixed songs from their demo tape into their self-titled debut album . &quot;Saliva&quot; was released on compact disc in mid-August 1997 through producer Yoshida&#x27;s own independent record label Rockingchair Records. A CD-release party was held at Club 616 in Memphis on Friday, August 15, 1997. The album went on to sell over 10,000 copies within two years, prompting Island Records A&amp;R representatives to again take notice of the band. The band&#x27;s debut album was repressed following Saliva&#x27;s major label success through a licensing deal between Rockingchair Records and hip hop record label Diamond Productions. The reissue was distributed by RED Distribution imprint RUMM (RED Urban Music Marketing) and featured an updated artwork designed by Brandon Seavers at AudioGraphic MasterWorks.

The band performed again at Memphis&#x27; Crossroads &#x27;98 music exhibition as part of Memphis in May&#x27;s Beale Street Music Festival showcase on May 3, 1998. Drummer Poole departed in late 1999 and was replaced by Paul Crosby.

===&quot;Every Six Seconds &quot; (2000–2001)===

Saliva&#x27;s album &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot; was released in 2001 and featured the singles &quot;Your Disease&quot; and &quot;Click Click Boom&quot;, both of which saw significant play on rock radio and helped bring the band into mainstream popularity. The songs &quot;Superstar&quot; and &quot;Click Click Boom&quot; are featured in the film &quot;The Fast And The Furious&quot;.

===&quot;Back into Your System &quot;(2002–2003)===
&quot;Back into Your System&quot;, their third album, was released in 2002, which included the chart topping hits &quot;Always&quot;, and &quot;Rest in Pieces&quot; co-written by James Michael and Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe. The band toured in 2003, opening for KISS and Aerosmith.

===&quot;Survival of the Sickest&quot;, departure of Chris D&#x27;Abaldo, and Jonathan Montoya (2004–2005)===
Saliva then released &quot;Survival of the Sickest&quot; on August 17, 2004, which reached number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On May 29, 2005, guitarist Chris D&#x27;Abaldo announced he had left the band &quot;for obvious reasons, as the band is not a unit anymore.&quot; He then shortly retracted his statement and apologized, declaring on the band&#x27;s website that &quot;there was a bit of an issue we&#x27;re working through and we&#x27;re looking forward to recording a new album later this year&quot;. However, the band&#x27;s website later apologized again for the confusion and confirmed that due to &quot;creative differences&quot;, D&#x27;Abaldo was in fact leaving the band, but that Saliva was &quot;completely moving forward as planned and [has] our best music ahead of us&quot;. D&#x27;Abaldo eventually moved on to start the band Smolder. Jake Stutevoss formerly of the band Future Leaders of the World replaced him in Saliva&#x27;s tour lineup. Stutevoss left the group right before the recording sessions for Ladies and Gentlemen. Jonathan Montoya, formerly of Full Devil Jacket, then became the next permanent member of Saliva.

===&quot;Blood Stained Love Story&quot; (2006–2007)===
A new single, titled &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; was released in November 2006 to radio stations and made it to No. 2 on the US Mainstream Rock charts. Saliva released the album &quot;Blood Stained Love Story&quot; on January 23, 2007. It has also been included as the background music for a number of Sony&#x27;s commercials for the PlayStation 3. It was also made the official Theme song for WrestleMania 23. The second single released off of the album was &quot;Broken Sunday&quot;, which reached No. 8 on the Mainstream Rock chart. Saliva&#x27;s tour manager Chris stated that the new single off &quot;Blood Stained Love Story&quot; would be &quot;King of the Stereo&quot;.

===&quot;Cinco Diablo&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and departure of Jonathan Montoya (2008–2010)===
In an interview with WWE on February 27, Scott said &quot;We&#x27;re going to go in the studio probably around May and record our next record. If you like &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;Click Click Boom&quot;, and more dynamic stuff, it&#x27;s going to be an ass-whooping of a record. It&#x27;s going to be 45 minutes of ass-whooping!&quot; Saliva toured with Sevendust in South Korea, Japan and a brief stint in Europe until July 2008.

As of April 30, 2008, Octane 20 on Sirius Satellite Radio began playing a new song titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Question My Heart&quot;, featuring Brent Smith from Shinedown. The song can be found on the album &quot;WWE The Music, Vol. 8&quot;, and was the official television theme song for the ECW brand.

Saliva&#x27;s sixth studio album is titled &quot;Cinco Diablo&quot; and was released on December 16, 2008. &quot;Hunt You Down&quot; was a song on the album that was then made the official WWE No Way Out 2009 theme song in February 2009. Saliva also made a song titled &quot;I Walk Alone&quot;, which is a theme song used by Batista since 2005, which has been used in &quot;Gears 5&quot; upon starting a Versus match as him as a skin of Marcus Fenix via an update.

The band worked on a reality television show style DVD following the recording of &quot;Cinco Diablo&quot; and life on the road. In an interview with MJP, Josey was asked if it was a TV Show to which Josey stated &quot;I hope not&quot;, and stated that he wanted it more as &quot;a DVD for our fans&quot;.

Saliva went on tour with Pop Evil, Since October, Dead Season, and Aranda. They were scheduled to join the 13th annual SnoCore Tour, but singer Josey Scott had ulcer surgery. Walt Lafty of Silvertide was hired to fill in for Scott for the tour, but Saliva ultimately decided to drop out of the tour, instead of touring with Lafty.

On March 23, 2010, the band released a Greatest Hits album titled, &quot;Moving Forward in Reverse: Greatest Hits&quot;. &quot;Time to Shine&quot; from said album was used as the official theme song for the &quot;WWE Extreme Rules&quot; Pay-Per-View in 2010.

On August 30, 2010, the band announced the departure of guitarist Jonathan Montoya, saying that they would carry on as a four piece.

===&quot;Under Your Skin&quot; and departure of Josey Scott (2010–2011)===
They had begun recording their seventh album, titled &quot;Under Your Skin&quot;, with Howard Benson.

The band supplied a song titled &quot;Badass&quot; to the &quot;Saw 3D&quot; soundtrack released on October 26, 2010.

The band released the lead single from their new album &quot;Under Your Skin&quot;, entitled &quot;Nothing&quot;. It was digitally released on February 1, 2011. &quot;Badass&quot; was later released as the second single, and reached No. 26 on Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks.

At the end of 2011, after 15 years with the band, Josey Scott decided to leave Saliva to pursue a solo Christian music career, as it was announced to public. It was later revealed by Scott that he left the band to &quot;be a father and get sober and clean up [his] life and find [himself] mentally and spiritually and philosophically&quot;.

===Bobby Amaru, &quot;In It to Win It&quot;, &quot;Rise Up&quot; and departure of Dave Novotny (2012–2015)===

In early January 2012 it was announced that Bobby Amaru has joined Saliva as the new vocalist. According to Wayne, &quot;he is a 28-year-old singer, songwriter, producer from Jacksonville, Florida who has a GREAT voice and will not only bring some fresh blood into the band but; will also put a new spin on the Saliva sound.&quot; Amaru was the frontman of his solo band Amaru, as well as the drummer for Burn Season.

On February 10, 2012, Saliva released a brand new single named &quot;All Around the World&quot; and said to write a brand new album straight after the tour. In addition to &quot;All Around the World&quot;, the band has been performing another new song titled &quot;One More Night&quot; on their current tour with 12 Stones and Royal Bliss.

On November 30, 2012, it was announced that the band had just signed a new record deal with Rumbum Records and that after they have finished their current tour, the band will return home to finish writing the new album and begin recording in January for a release date some time in the spring.

On February 5, 2013, Saliva began recording a new album which would later be named &quot;In It to Win It&quot;. &quot;In It to Win It&quot; was to be the band&#x27;s eighth record (1st with RumBum Records) with producer Bobby Huff, and executive producer Luis Bacardi. Bobby Huff co-wrote Saliva&#x27;s single &quot;Badass&quot; and has worked with artists such as Meat Loaf, 3 Doors Down and Cavo.

On April 30, 2013, the band released its first single from the new album, the aggressively anthemic title track &quot;In It To Win It&quot;. On September 3, 2013, the band released the album &quot;In It to Win It&quot;. On January 22, 2014, a new single &quot;Rise Up&quot; was announced. It was also revealed that &quot;In It to Win It&quot; was an early limited time fan only sneak peek and the band is going to release the new record titled &quot;Rise Up&quot; with the same songs re-arranged. On June 4, 2014, Swinny announced that rhythm guitarist Jonathan Montoya had returned the band after almost four years.

In February 2015, bassist Dave Novotny left the band and was replaced by former Shinedown bassist Brad Stewart.

===&quot;Love, Lies &amp; Therapy&quot; (2016–2017)===
On April 16, 2016 Saliva announced their new album, titled &quot;Love, Lies &amp; Therapy&quot; would be released June 10, 2016. Later in May, the group announced they would be supporting the album by taking part of the &quot;Make America Rock Again&quot; tour in the summer 2016 alongside Trapt, Saving Abel, Alien Ant Farm, Crazy Town, 12 Stones, Tantric and Drowning Pool, Fuel, Puddle Of Mudd and P.O.D.

=== &quot;10 Lives&quot;, lineup changes, reunion with Josey Scott, death of Wayne Swinny, and &quot;Revelation&quot; (2018–present)===
In mid-2018, drummer Paul Crosby announced his departure from the band after 18 years. Shortly afterward, bassist Brad Stewart would also depart to focus on other touring and projects. Saliva then released their tenth studio record, &quot;10 Lives&quot;, on October 19, 2018 via Megaforce Records. The album was produced by frontman Bobby Amaru and Steve Perreira in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2019, both Crosby and Stewart confirmed their return to the band. Saliva would go on to tour in 2019 as a part of Puddle of Mudd&#x27;s Muddfest.

In October 2019, former vocalist Josey Scott announced on &quot;The Morning Dump&quot; podcast that he planned to reunite with Saliva for a tour and a new studio album. This was confirmed by Swinny in an interview with Detroit&#x27;s WRIF Radio, adding that although &quot;there&#x27;s nothing on paper,&quot; the reunion should take place from 2020 into 2021 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot;. In addition to Scott rejoining, Swinny also suggested that former guitarist Chris D&#x27;Abaldo may also be taking part. In January 2021, it was announced that these plans were put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On April 16, 2021, the band released a music video for &quot;After Me&quot; following the 20th anniversary of their second album &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot;. Also, guitarist and founder Wayne Swinney sat out touring for August, due to testing positive for COVID-19, with 9th Planet guitarist Josh Kulack filling in for him.
On May 14, 2022, Paul Crosby left Saliva for the second time. The band kept performing with Lee Hutt before Sammi Jo Bishop was announced as their permanent drummer.

On September 11, 2022, Josey Scott made his first appearance with the band as a special guest since departing in 2011, where they performed three songs together: &quot;Your Disease&quot;, &quot;Always&quot;, and &quot;Click Click Boom.&quot;

On March 22, 2023, guitarist and founding member Wayne Swinny died from a brain hemorrhage, at the age of 59. He was the last original member who still remained with the band.

In the weeks following Swinny&#x27;s death, the band announced they would be continuing in honour of him. They completed a North American co-headlining tour with Drowning Pool, with support from Adelitas Way and Any Given Sin, across September and October 2023.

In May 2023, Scott announced that he would begin touring with a new band entitled Josey Scott&#x27;s Saliva, performing Saliva&#x27;s songs from his era as well as his new songs.

In September 2023, the band released their 11th studio album, &quot;Revelation&quot;. The album, recorded over the pandemic, is the last to feature Swinny&#x27;s guitar playing.

<text>Framley Parsonage is a novel by English author Anthony Trollope. It was first published in serial form in the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; in 1860, then in book form in April 1861. It is the fourth book in the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot; series, preceded by &quot;Doctor Thorne&quot; and followed by &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The hero of &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;, Mark Robarts, is a young vicar, settled in the village of Framley in Barsetshire with his wife and children. The living has come into his hands through Lady Lufton, the mother of his childhood friend Ludovic, Lord Lufton. Mark has ambitions to further his career and begins to seek connections in the county&#x27;s high society. He is soon preyed upon by local Whig Member of Parliament Mr Sowerby, who asks him to guarantee a substantial loan, which in a moment of weakness Mark agrees to do, even though he does not have the means to meet the loan amount if called upon to redeem it, and knows Sowerby to be a notorious debtor. The consequences of this blunder play a major role in the plot, with Mark eventually being publicly humiliated when bailiffs arrive and begin to take an inventory of the Robarts&#x27; furniture. At the last moment, Lord Lufton forces the reluctant Mark to accept a loan from him to meet the debt.

Another plot line deals with the romance between Mark&#x27;s sister Lucy and Lord Lufton. The couple are deeply in love and the young man proposes, but Lady Lufton is against the marriage. She would prefer that her son instead choose the coldly beautiful Griselda Grantly, daughter of Archdeacon Grantly, and fears that Lucy is too &quot;insignificant&quot; for such a high position. Lucy herself recognises the great gulf between their social positions and declines the proposal. When Lord Lufton persists, she agrees only on condition that Lady Lufton ask her to accept her son. Lucy&#x27;s conduct and charity (especially towards the family of poor priest Josiah Crawley) weaken her ladyship&#x27;s resolve. In addition, Griselda becomes engaged to Lord Dumbello. But it is the determination of Lord Lufton that in the end vanquishes his doting mother.

The book ends with Lucy and Ludovic&#x27;s marriage as well as three other marriages. Two of these involve the daughters of Bishop Proudie and Archdeacon Grantly. The rivalry between Mrs Proudie and Mrs Grantly over their matrimonial ambitions forms a significant comic subplot, with the latter triumphant. The other marriage is that of the outspoken heiress, Martha Dunstable, to Doctor Thorne, the eponymous hero of the preceding novel in the series.

==Author&#x27;s description and other criticism==
In his autobiography, Trollope described &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;: &quot;The story was thoroughly English. There was a little fox-hunting and a little , some Christian virtue and some Christian cant. There was no heroism and no villainy. There was much Church, but more love-making.&quot;

The &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; of 1861 saw the book as marking the eclipse of Byronism in the literary world, and its replacement by what it called “accurate and faithful portraits of mediocre respectability.”

20th century criticism would confirm the accuracy of Trollope&#x27;s representation of the habits and mores of his mid-Victorian middle-class world in &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;, whilst also hinting the work perhaps suffered from the (necessary) haste involved in its serial composition.

<text>Caius Gabriel Cibber (1630–1700) was a Danish sculptor, who enjoyed great success in England, and was the father of the actor, author and poet laureate Colley Cibber. He was appointed &quot;carver to the king&#x27;s closet&quot; by William III.

==Biography==
Cibber was born in Flensburg in the province of Schleswig in Denmark. His father was a cabinetmaker, supposedly to King Frederick III of Denmark. He travelled to Italy to study art, where he may have changed his name from Sieber or Sibert to Cibo, to suggest connection with the Cibos, an old and noble Italian family to which Pope Innocent VIII had belonged. Cibber later emigrated to London, England, probably via the Netherlands. At first, he worked for the mason-sculptor John Stone, who had a workshop on Long Acre, until he set up his own studio after Stone&#x27;s death in 1667.

In 1668, Cibber became a Freeman, by Redemption, of the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers, and in 1679 he became a Liveryman of the same Company, remaining so until his death. He carved the company&#x27;s coat of arms, and a stone mermaid pump, which stood outside Leathersellers&#x27; Hall in Little St Helen&#x27;s, off Bishopsgate. The mermaid&#x27;s head survives, having been discovered in excavations at St Helen&#x27;s Place in 1925.

A decade or more after his arrival in London, Cibber married (as his second wife—his first wife had died) Jane Colley on 24 November 1670 at St Giles in the Fields, London. In the marriage licence documents, Cibber&#x27;s age is given as &#x27;about 33&#x27;. Jane came from a family of English gentry who claimed descent from the sister of William of Wykeham, and her grandfather, Sir Antony Colley, had been a prominent Cavalier during the English Civil War. They had three children: Colley, Lewis, and Veronica. Between 1673 and 1679, Cibber was detained in Marshalsea prison and the King&#x27;s Bench prison for unpaid gambling debts, though he was able to continue his work, and borrowed substantial sums from Edward Colley, his brother-in-law.

Many of his works were, or are, on public display in London, including his statue of Charles II (1681), which still stands (rather worn away) in Soho Square. He made two lifelike human statues in Portland stone entitled &quot;Melancholy&quot; and &quot;Raving Madness&quot; for the gates of the 17th century mental hospital, known as Bedlam (now Bethlem Royal Hospital), which can currently be seen in their museum (modelli in V&amp;A). They were said to be modelled on two inmates of the asylum, one of whom was Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s mad porter, Daniel. The two statues became his most famous work, and were mentioned in Alexander Pope&#x27;s satire &quot;The Dunciad&quot;. He also created the bas reliefs on the base of the Monument to the Great Fire of London; his reliefs at the Royal Exchange have been destroyed. He produced sets of sculpture for Trinity College, Cambridge, and for the Danish Church on Wellclose Square, where he was buried. The church was demolished in 1869 and the grave was lost at that point.

== Major works ==
Cibber worked extensively with the architects Sir Christopher Wren (on St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Hampton Court Palace) and William Talman (on Chatsworth House (1688–91) and the version of Thoresby Hall which was entirely burnt down in 1745).

Cibber produced a number of excellent church monuments, including those to the 7th and 8th Earls of Rutland at Bottesford, Leicestershire, and the extraordinary Sackville monument at Withyham in East Sussex. A &quot;Flora&quot; in the gardens at Chatsworth has in recent years been returned to the Temple named after her; other large works there include the &quot;Sea Horse Fountain&quot;.

==Other works==
*Seven statues for Belvoir Castle (1680)
*Statues of &quot;Melancholy&quot; and &quot;Raving Madness&quot; for Bethlehem Hospital (1680) now in the Bethlem Museum of the Mind.
*Boy playing Bagpipes originally at Welcombe (1680) now in the Victoria and Albert Museum
*Statue on Library, Trinity College, Cambridge (1681)
*Statue of Charles II in Soho Square (1681)
* Statue of William of Wykeham at Winchester College (1697).

<doc id="216752" wikidata="Q4382169" url="?curid=216752" title="Processor affinity">
<text>Processor affinity, or CPU pinning or &quot;cache affinity&quot;, enables the binding and unbinding of a process or a thread to a central processing unit (CPU) or a range of CPUs, so that the process or thread will execute only on the designated CPU or CPUs rather than any CPU. This can be viewed as a modification of the native central queue scheduling algorithm in a symmetric multiprocessing operating system. Each item in the queue has a tag indicating its kin processor. At the time of resource allocation, each task is allocated to its kin processor in preference to others.

Processor affinity takes advantage of the fact that remnants of a process that was run on a given processor may remain in that processor&#x27;s state (for example, data in the cache memory) after another process was run on that processor. Scheduling a CPU-intensive process that has few interrupts to execute on the same processor may improve its performance by reducing degrading events such as cache misses, but may slow down ordinary programs because they would need to wait for that CPU to become available again. A practical example of processor affinity is executing multiple instances of a non-threaded application, such as some graphics-rendering software. 

Scheduling-algorithm implementations vary in adherence to processor affinity. Under certain circumstances, some implementations will allow a task to change to another processor if it results in higher efficiency. For example, when two processor-intensive tasks (A and B) have affinity to one processor while another processor remains unused, many schedulers will shift task B to the second processor in order to maximize processor use. Task B will then acquire affinity with the second processor, while task A will continue to have affinity with the original processor.

==Usage==
Processor affinity can effectively reduce cache problems, but it does not reduce the persistent load-balancing problem. Also note that processor affinity becomes more complicated in systems with non-uniform architectures. For example, a system with two dual-core hyper-threaded CPUs presents a challenge to a scheduling algorithm.

There is complete affinity between two virtual CPUs implemented on the same core via hyper-threading, partial affinity between two cores on the same physical processor (as the cores share some, but not all, cache), and no affinity between separate physical processors. As other resources are also shared, processor affinity alone cannot be used as the basis for CPU dispatching. If a process has recently run on one virtual hyper-threaded CPU in a given core, and that virtual CPU is currently busy but its partner CPU is not, cache affinity would suggest that the process should be dispatched to the idle partner CPU. However, the two virtual CPUs compete for essentially all computing, cache, and memory resources. In this situation, it would typically be more efficient to dispatch the process to a different core or CPU, if one is available. This could incur a penalty when process repopulates the cache, but overall performance could be higher as the process would not have to compete for resources within the CPU.

==Specific operating systems==
On Linux, the CPU affinity of a process can be altered with the taskset(1) program and the sched_setaffinity(2) system call. The affinity of a thread can be altered with one of the library functions: pthread_setaffinity_np(3) or pthread_attr_setaffinity_np(3).

On SGI systems, dplace binds a process to a set of CPUs.

On DragonFly BSD 1.9 (2007) and later versions, usched_set system call can be used to control the affinity of a process. On NetBSD 5.0, FreeBSD 7.2, DragonFly BSD 4.7 and later versions can use pthread_setaffinity_np and pthread_getaffinity_np. In NetBSD, the psrset utility to set a thread&#x27;s affinity to a certain CPU set. In FreeBSD, cpuset utility is used to create CPU sets and to assign processes to these sets. In DragonFly BSD 3.1 (2012) and later, usched utility can be used for assigning processes to a certain CPU set.

On Windows NT and its successors, thread and process CPU affinities can be set separately by using SetThreadAffinityMask and SetProcessAffinityMask API calls or via the Task Manager interface (for process affinity only).

macOS exposes an affinity API that provides hints to the kernel how to schedule threads according to affinity sets.

On Solaris it is possible to control bindings of processes and LWPs to processor using the pbind(1) program. To control the affinity programmatically processor_bind(2) can be used. There are more generic interfaces available such as pset_bind(2) or lgrp_affinity_get(3LGRP) using processor set and locality groups concepts.

On AIX it is possible to control bindings of processes using the bindprocessor command and the bindprocessor API.

<text>Kassel district (German: Landkreis Kassel) is a district in the north of Hesse, Germany. Neighboring districts are Northeim, Göttingen, Werra-Meißner, Schwalm-Eder, Waldeck-Frankenberg, Höxter. The independent city of Kassel is nearly completely surrounded by the district.
==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Weser, which also forms part of the eastern boundary. Its headstream, the Fulda, flows through the southern part of the district including the city of Kassel. In the north of the district there is the Diemel as a tributary of the Weser.

==History==
The area was first populated by the ancient Germanic tribe of Chatti, who later founded the state of Hesse. The present county was disputed between various principalities (Hesse, Mainz, Paderborn, Cologne and Braunschweig) in the early Middle Ages; later it became part of Hesse and Hesse-Kassel. This state was annexed by Prussia in 1866 .

The modern federal state of Hesse was founded after 1945. This state reformed its districts in the 1970s. In 1972, the previous districts of Kassel, Hofgeismar and Wolfhagen, were merged to form the newly established district of Kassel.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms shows the lion of Hesse in the top part, as Kassel was the capital of the county of Hesse until 1866, when it moved to Prussia. In the lower part it has three oak leaves taken from the coat of arms of the Hofgeismar district, and a wolf&#x27;s hook symbolizing the Wolfhagen district.

==Tourism and sights==
Many characters and places from the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm have originated in the area around Kassel. Thus the tale of Sleeping Beauty locates at the Sababurg in Reinhardswald and that of Rapunzel on the Trendelburg. Therefore, the district of Kassel is also marketed as the &quot;Land of the Brothers Grimm&quot;. The region is the center of the &quot;German Fairy Tale Route&quot;.

The district is represented in the European Garden Heritage Network with three parks: The park of the castles Schloss Wilhelmsthal (in Calden), the Escheberg-Castle and the Sababurg.

==Transportation==
The district is served by the motorways 7 ( Würzburg - Kassel - Hanover ), 44 (Kassel - Dortmund ) and 49 (Kassel-Borken). Other roadlinks, including the B 7, B 83 and B 251, exist.

With the Airport Kassel-Waldau in 1924 there was an airport with international connections. In 1970 it was closed with the opening of the new Kassel Calden Airport. Currently this airport is completely rebuilt.

The rail transport is oriented to the city of Kassel with tram and rail lines.

==Economy==
Some parts of the district benefit from good infrastructure. Baunatal has large Volkswagen and Lohfelden factories and also has several industrial areas on the border with the city of Kassel. Other more rural parts had experienced population decline, though this has halted in recent years.

<text>Susannah Maria Cibber (née Arne; February 1714 – 30 January 1766) was a celebrated English singer and actress. She was the sister of the composer Thomas Arne. Although she began her career as a soprano, her voice lowered in the early part of her career to that of a true contralto. She was universally admired for her ability to move her audiences emotionally both as an actress and vocalist. Possessing a sweet, expressive, and agile singing voice with a wide vocal range, Cibber was an immensely popular singer, even if at times her voice was criticized for a lack of polished technique. Charles Burney wrote of her singing that &quot;by a natural pathos, and perfect conception of the words, she often penetrated the heart, when others, with infinitely greater voice and skill, could only reach the ear.&quot; Cibber was particularly admired by Handel, who wrote numerous parts especially for her including the contralto arias in his 1741 oratorio &quot;Messiah&quot;, the role of Micah in &quot;Samson&quot;, the role of Lichas in &quot;Hercules&quot; and the role of David in &quot;Saul&quot; among others. In the mid-1730s she began appearing in plays in addition to appearing in operas and oratorios. She became the greatest dramatic actress of the eighteenth-century London stage and at the time of her death was the highest-paid actress in England.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Susannah Maria Arne was born in the Covent Garden area of London to Thomas and Anne Arne; her father and grandfather were upholsterers and office holders in the Worshipful Company of Upholders. As a child, she studied singing with her brother Thomas, who would later become one of the most important composers of the era and an important part of Cibber&#x27;s career as a singer. Her other brother, Richard, also worked as a singer and actor but never achieved the same level of success as his siblings.

=== Career, marriages and scandal ===
On 13 March 1732, she made her professional debut in the title role of John Frederick Lampe&#x27;s setting of Henry Carey&#x27;s &quot;Amelia&quot; to positive reviews, at the Little Theatre. Her performances over the following two years included roles in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;, and her brother&#x27;s &quot;Rosamund&quot;, &quot;The Opera of Operas&quot; and &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;.

The year 1733 proved to be a critical year for Susannah Arne. She met Handel while rehearsing and performing the role of Jael in the original production of his oratorio &quot;Deborah&quot;. It was the beginning of a close and lifelong friendship. Handel patiently taught her parts note by note as she could not read music. Also that year, her name appeared in the playbills offering entr&#x27;acte songs &quot;by popular demand&quot; at the Haymarket, performances which became very popular. During the 1733–1744 acting season, the actor Theophilus Cibber and his theatre company were introduced to the young Susannah.

In April 1734, Susannah Arne married actor Theophilus Cibber. He was the son of playwright, theatre manager, and poet laureate Colley Cibber, whose company of players was in residence at Drury Lane at this time. The marriage proved beneficial to Susannah&#x27;s career and position in the London theatre, as she became a regular at that house for many years, now performing under the name &quot;Mrs Cibber&quot;. Even more important was the attention of her father-in-law Colley Cibber who, recognizing in Susannah the makings of a great tragic actress, trained her. Susannah received hours of acting tuition from her new father-in-law, and he helped teach her valuable vocal intonations and tragic gestures that shaped her into the most celebrated tragedienne of her time. Further, adopting a &#x27;Cibberian identity&#x27; proved very advantageous for Susannah&#x27;s career. Public audiences began to view her as the young ingénue of the Cibber acting dynasty, which in turn, helped land her leading roles. Her brother Thomas also benefited from the marriage as he became house composer at Drury Lane, and wrote music for a number of plays and pantomimes over the next several years.

In 1736, Cibber made her début as a dramatic actress in the title role of Aaron Hill&#x27;s &quot;Zara&quot;, with great success. She went on to portray numerous Shakespearean roles to critical acclaim, which she later continued to perform with David Garrick. In 1737 a much noted dispute with Kitty Clive over the part of Polly in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; erupted and inspired a satire, &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Pantomime, or The Contending Columbine&quot;. The following year, Cibber portrayed the role of David in the original production of Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Saul&quot; and she appeared in the world premiere of her brother&#x27;s immensely popular masque &quot;Comus&quot;.

Cibber&#x27;s marriage was not a happy one. He was reportedly abusive and a profligate spender, and even began selling off some of his wife&#x27;s wardrobe and personal effects to deter creditors. In order to pay rent, the Cibbers took in a wealthy tenant, William Sloper (who would later sit in Parliament for Great Bedwyn). The resultant relationship between these three people led to a notorious lawsuit in 1738, in which Cibber accused Sloper of &quot;Assaulting, Ravishing and Carnally Knowing&quot; his wife. Various versions of the scandal suggest that all three may have been involved in a &quot;ménage à trois&quot;. One account states that Cibber forced his wife at gunpoint to sleep with Sloper; another places a spy in a closet at the scene of one of their trysts, in order to gather testimony for the lawsuit. In any event, Theophilus Cibber was awarded a paltry £10 in damages. The following year, he brought a second case against Sloper for &quot;detaining&quot; his wife. In fact, Cibber and Sloper had run off together, and had a daughter, Susannah Maria (Molly). This time Theophilus Cibber was awarded £500. His intention, going into the lawsuit against his estranged wife and her new lover, was to shame Cibber as a cruel, unfaithful wife. However, as she was pregnant at the time of the trial, she shifted the public perception of herself to being an innocent woman, merely the victim of her husband&#x27;s cruelty and greed.

In 1740, Cibber sang in the world premiere of her brother&#x27;s masque &quot;Alfred&quot;. She moved to Dublin, and in the autumn of 1741 for a busy season at the Aungier Street Theatre with her good friend and mentor, the actor James Quinn. Handel joined her there, and she performed in several concerts with him conducting including performances of &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;, &quot;Esther&quot;, and &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot;. She also joined the premiere performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; on 13 April 1742, singing the contralto solos. Legend has it that Dr Patrick Delany, the chancellor of Christ Church Cathedral, upon hearing her sing &quot;He was despised&quot;, proclaimed &quot;Woman, for this be all thy sins forgiven thee!&quot; On 21 and 28 July she sang a duo recital with her sister-in-law, the soprano Cecilia Arne (née Young). The Dublin notices were full of praise for Cibber for both her acting and her singing. Thomas Sheridan wrote:

&quot;What then must [the mighty force of oratorical expression] be, when conveyed to the heart with all the superadded powers and charms of musick? No person of sensibility, who has had the good fortune to hear Mrs Cibber sing the oratorio of the Messiah, will find it very difficult to give credit to accounts of the most wonderful effects produced from so powerful a union.&quot;

Eventually the scandal surrounding Cibber died down, and she returned to the London stage in autumn 1742. The first role she performed upon her return was that of Desdemona, from &quot;Othello&quot;. The tragic nature of her character helped perpetuate the public&#x27;s view of her as a &#x27;wronged wife&#x27;, a persona she adopted following the well-documented breakdown of her marriage. Following this, she continued adding many more tragic roles to her repertoire.

Her home in London became a salon of sorts on Sunday evenings. Burney, referring to these evenings, wrote that he found himself &quot;in a constellation of wits, poets, actors, and men of letters&quot;, including Handel, Garrick, and Arne. She was also engaged by Handel for his oratorio season, creating the role of Micah in &quot;Samson&quot;. In 1744–1745 she continued to sing for Handel, now at the King&#x27;s Theatre in The Haymarket. Her roles included Jael in &quot;Deborah&quot;, Lichas in &quot;Hercules&quot; and David in &quot;Saul&quot;, and she sang in the oratorios &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot;, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot; and &quot;Messiah&quot;. Handel also wrote the part of Daniel in &quot;Belshazzar&quot; for her but, due to illness, she never sang the role.

In 1744, Cibber became David Garrick&#x27;s leading lady at Drury Lane, the theatre managed by her father-in-law, and their partnership and friendship (reflected in letters) continued until her death. Garrick directed her, alongside actor Spranger Barry, in a successful adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, written by Garrick himself. Garrick&#x27;s version was well received by eighteenth-century audiences, as it omitted many &#x27;indecent&#x27; moments, and added to the tragic tomb scene between Romeo and Juliet, whereupon the characters have a final conversation, after Romeo has poisoned himself. However, after a brief falling-out between Garrick and Cibber, she and Barry took their version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; to Garrick&#x27;s rival, John Rich, at Covent Garden. This prompted Garrick to cast himself and young actress George Anne Bellamy in a rival version of the same show, performed across the street in Drury Lane, to run concurrently with Cibber and Barry&#x27;s version. For twelve nights, beginning on 28 September 1750, rival versions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; ran in London, thrilling audiences. Both shows received much publicity, and audiences often watched both versions, to decide who they thought were the superior star-crossed lovers. Cibber fell ill on the thirteenth night, ending the competition between the two shows. Eventually, she and Garrick reconciled, and she returned to Drury Lane in 1753.
From 1744 to 1765 she added numerous dramatic roles to her repertory and was, after Garrick, the highest paid thespian in London. Contemporary reviews, dedications, letters and poems all refer to her ability to affect the listener deeply. She wrote a masque which was performed in Covent Garden in 1751. Also, during this time, Susannah became the primary caregiver and teacher for her young nephew, Michael Arne. The boy&#x27;s mother, Cecilia Arne, suffered from recurring health problems and this, compounded with Thomas&#x27;s busy work schedule, made it impossible for his parents to care for him. Under Susannah&#x27;s guidance, Michael started out as a stage actor at Drury Lane before he reached the age of ten. He later followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps to become a successful composer.

== Children ==
One source states that she had a son and a daughter, who both died young, by William Sloper.

== Death ==
Susannah died on 30 January 1766 and was buried in the north cloisters of Westminster Abbey. On the day of her death, Covent Garden and Drury Lane closed their doors as a tribute to one of their finest actresses and singers. Garrick, upon hearing of her death, said: &quot;Then tragedy dies with her&quot;.

The poet George Keate wrote in that year &quot;A Poem to the Memory of the Celebrated Mrs Cibber&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
... Closed are those eyes which knew each varied art,
And could my meaning with such force inspire;
Call tears of pity from the melting heart,
Freeze with wild horror, or with rapture fire! ...
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Mark 16 is the final chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Christopher Tuckett refers to it as a &quot;sequel to the story of Jesus&#x27; death and burial&quot;. The chapter begins after the sabbath has ended, with Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome purchasing spices to bring to the tomb next morning to anoint Jesus&#x27; body. There they encounter the stone rolled away, the tomb open, and a young man dressed in white who announces the resurrection of Jesus (16:1–6). The two oldest manuscripts of Mark 16 (from the 300s) conclude with verse 8, which ends with the women fleeing from the empty tomb, and saying &quot;nothing to anyone, because they were too frightened&quot;.

Textual critics have identified two distinct alternative endings: the &quot;Longer Ending&quot; (verses 9–20) and the unversed &quot;Shorter Ending&quot; or &quot;lost ending&quot;, which appear together in six Greek manuscripts, and in dozens of Ethiopic copies. Modern versions of the New Testament generally include the Longer Ending, but place it in brackets or otherwise format it to show that it was not part of the original text.

==Text==

===Textual witnesses===
Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:
*Codex Vaticanus (325–350; extant verses 1–8)
*Codex Sinaiticus (330–360; extant verses 1–8)
*Codex Bezae (~400; complete: 1–20)
*Codex Alexandrinus (400–440; complete: 1–20)
*Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete: 1–20)

===Sources===
While some scholars argue that Mark 16 is a Markan composition, others argue that the chapter comes from an older tradition in the pre-Markan passion story. Those arguing in favor of Markan creation point to the numerous time indicators in verse 2, which bear similarities to other phrases in Mark. The scholars who argue in favor of Mark&#x27;s use of a prior tradition argue that phrases such as &quot;on the first day of the week&quot; instead of the &quot;third day&quot; motif indicates a primitive tradition. Furthermore, many phrases found in Mark 16 seem to be non-Markan in their vocabulary. Dale Allison argues that, &quot;The reduction of the empty tomb to Markan creativity, whatever the redactional motivation postulated, is not a compelling point of view...the case for the redactional origin of Mark 16:1–8 is unpersuasive, which is why so many Markan scholars, despite their differences on the details, see tradition here.&quot; The fact that Mark 16 is extremely reserved in its theological expression, having no Christological titles, proofs or prophecies, descriptions of the resurrection, and a reserved description of the angel at the tomb indicate a more primitive narrative source.

== Verses 1–8 (the empty tomb) ==

===Verse 1===

The Sabbath ended at dusk, on the day known to Christians as Holy Saturday.

===Verse 2===

Just after sunrise, Mary Magdalene, another Mary, the mother of James, and Salome come with the spices to anoint Jesus&#x27; body. Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome are also mentioned among the women &quot;looking on from afar&quot; in , although those who &quot;saw where the body was laid&quot; in were only Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses.

Luke 24:1 states that the women had &quot;prepared&quot; the spices but seems to say that Nicodemus had already anointed his body. John 20:1 and Matthew 28:1 simply say &quot;Mary Magdalene and the other Mary&quot; came to see the tomb.

===Verses 3–4===
The women wonder how they will remove the stone over the tomb. Upon their arrival, they find the stone already gone and go into the tomb. According to Jesuit writer John J. Kilgallen, this shows that in Mark&#x27;s account they expected to find the body of Jesus. Instead, they find a young man dressed in a white robe who is sitting on the right and who tells them that Jesus &quot;has risen&quot; and shows them &quot;the place where they laid him&quot; (verses 5–7).

===Verses 5–7===
The white robe indicates that he is probably an angel: Matthew 28:5 describes him as such, and has him seated on the stone, away from the entrance. In the account in there were two men. John says that Mary Magdalene saw two angels after finding the empty tomb and showing it to the other disciples (; ). She comes back to the tomb, talks to the angels, and then Jesus appears to her.

Jesus had predicted his resurrection and returning to Galilee during the Last Supper in Mark (). Mark uses the passive verb form &quot;ēgerthē&quot;, translated &quot;he was raised&quot;, indicating God raised him from the dead, rather than &quot;he is risen&quot;, as translated in the NIV.

Peter, last seen in tears two mornings previously, having denied any knowledge of Jesus (), is mentioned in particular. Gregory the Great notes that &quot;had the Angel not referred to him in this way, Peter would never have dared to appear again among the Apostles. He is bidden then by name to come, so that he will not despair because of his denial of Christ&quot;.

The last appearance of Peter&#x27;s name in verse 7 (also the last among the disciples&#x27; names to be mentioned) can be connected to the first appearance of his name (as &#x27;Simon&#x27;) in Mark 1:16 to form a literary &quot;inclusio&quot; of eyewitness testimony to indicate Peter as the main eyewitness source in the Gospel of Mark.

===Verse 8===
Mark 16:1–8 ends with the response of the women: Those women, who are afraid (compare ), then flee and keep quiet about what they saw. Kilgallen comments that fear is the most common human reaction to the divine presence in the Bible. Mike Winger, in his video series on Mark, explains the note that the women &quot;said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid&quot; not as indicating that they never spoke about it, ever, but that on their way to report to the disciples and Peter, they did not stop to pass the time of day or gossip with anyone until they had delivered the message.

This is where the undisputed part of Mark&#x27;s Gospel ends. Jesus is thus announced to have been raised from the dead, and to have gone ahead of the disciples to Galilee, where they will see Him.

==Alternate endings==
Mark has two additional endings, the longer ending (verse 9–20), and the shorter ending (unversed). 


=== Longer ending ===

====Text and interpretation====
In this 12-verse passage, the author refers to Jesus&#x27; appearances to Mary Magdalene, two disciples, and then the Eleven (the Twelve Apostles minus Judas). The text concludes with the Great Commission, declaring that believers that have been baptized will be saved while nonbelievers will be condemned, and pictures Jesus taken to Heaven and sitting at the Right Hand of God.

: Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene, who is now described as someone whom Jesus healed from possession by seven demons. She then &quot;tells the other disciples&quot; what she saw, but no one believes her.

: Jesus appears &quot;in a different form&quot; to two unnamed disciples. They, too, are disbelieved when they tell what they saw.

: Jesus then appears at dinner to all the remaining eleven Apostles. He rebukes them for not believing the earlier reports of his resurrection and tells them to go and &quot;proclaim the good news to all creation. The one who believes and is baptised will be saved; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.&quot; Belief and non-belief are a dominant theme in the Longer Ending: there are two references to believing (verses 16 and 17) and four references to not believing (verses 11, 13, 14 and 16). Johann Albrecht Bengel, in his &quot;Gnomon of the New Testament&quot;, defends the disciples: &quot;They did believe: but presently there recurred to them a suspicion as to the truth, and even positive unbelief.&quot;

: Jesus states that believers will &quot;cast out demons&quot; and &quot;speak in new tongues&quot;. They will also be able to handle snakes, be immune from any poison they might happen to drink, and will be able to heal the sick. Kilgallen, picturing an author putting words in Jesus&#x27; mouth, has suggested that these verses were a means by which early Christians asserted that their new faith was accompanied by special powers. According to Brown, by showing examples of unjustified unbelief in verses 10–13, and stating that unbelievers will be condemned and that believers will be validated by signs, the author may have been attempting to convince the reader to rely on what the disciples preached about Jesus.

: Jesus is then taken up into heaven where, Mark states, he sits at the right hand of God. The author refers to Psalm 110:1, quoted in Mark 12:36, about the Lord sitting at the right hand of God.

: the eleven leave and are dispersed throughout the world, &quot;proclaim[ing] the good news everywhere&quot; while the works with them; the mediaeval feast of the Dispersion of the Apostles celebrated this event. Several signs from God accompanied their preaching. The word &quot;Amen&quot; was added in some ancient versions.

===Shorter ending/conclusio brevior===
The &quot;Shorter Ending&quot; or &quot;conclusio brevior&quot; (first manuscript c. 3rd century), with slight variations, is usually unversed, and runs as follows:
Some texts add &quot;Amen&quot; at the end.

While the New Revised Standard Version places this verse between verse 8 and 9, it could also be read as verse 21. The women, in this passage, fulfill the instructions given in verse 7, but this obedience would appear to contradict the silence reported of them in verse 8, unless their fear was only temporary.

== Manuscripts ==
The earliest extant complete manuscripts of Mark, Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, two 4th-century manuscripts, do not contain the last twelve verses, 16:9–20, nor the unversed shorter ending. Codex Vaticanus (4th century) has a blank column after ending at 16:8 and placing &quot;kata Markon&quot;, &quot;according to Mark&quot;. There are three other blank columns in Vaticanus, in the Old Testament, but they are each due to incidental factors in the production of the codex: a change to the column-format, a change of scribes, and the conclusion of the Old Testament portion of the text. The blank column between Mark 16:8 and the beginning of Luke, however, is deliberately placed.

== Explanations ==
Both the shorter and the longer ending are considered to be later writings, which were added to Mark. Scholars disagree whether verse 8 was the original ending, or if there was an ending which is now lost. In the early 20th century, the view prevailed that the original ending was lost, but in the second part of the 20th century the view prevailed that verse 8 was the original ending, as intended by the author.

===Ending at verse 8===
Although scholars almost universally reject Mark 16:9–20, a debate continues about whether the ending at 16:8 is intentional or accidental.

====Intentional====
Numerous arguments have been given to explain why verse 8 is the intended ending.

There is scholarly work that suggests the &quot;short ending&quot; is more appropriate as it fits with the &#x27;reversal of expectation&#x27; theme in the Gospel of Mark. Having the women run away afraid is contrasted in the reader&#x27;s mind with Jesus&#x27; appearances and statements which help confirm the expectation, built up in , , , and Jesus&#x27; prediction during the Last Supper of his rising after his death. According to Brown, this ending is consistent with Mark&#x27;s theology, where even miracles, such as the resurrection, do not produce the proper understanding or faith among Jesus&#x27; followers. Richard A. Burridge argues that, in keeping with Mark&#x27;s picture of discipleship, the question of whether it all comes right in the end is left open:
Burridge compares the ending of Mark to its beginning:
Kilgallen proposes that maybe Mark gives no description of the resurrected Jesus because Mark did not want to try to describe the nature of the divine resurrected Jesus. Some interpreters have concluded that Mark&#x27;s intended readers already knew the traditions of Jesus&#x27; appearances, and that Mark brings the story to a close here to highlight the resurrection and leave anticipation of the &quot;parousia&quot; (Second Coming). Others have argued that this announcement of the resurrection and Jesus going to Galilee is the &quot;parousia&quot; (see also Preterism), but Raymond E. Brown argues that a &quot;parousia&quot; confined only to Galilee is improbable.

====Unintentional====

The final sentence in verse 8 is regarded as strange by some scholars. In the Greek text, it finishes with the conjunction γαρ (&quot;gar&quot;, &quot;for&quot;). It is contended by some who see 16:9–20 as originally Markan that γαρ literally means &quot;because&quot;, and this ending to verse 8 is therefore not grammatically coherent (literally, it would read &quot;they were afraid because&quot;). However, γαρ may end a sentence and does so in various Greek compositions, including some sentences in the Septuagint; Protagoras, a contemporary of Socrates, even ended a speech with γαρ. Although γαρ is never the first word of a sentence, there is no rule against it being the last word, even though it is not a common construction. If the Gospel of Mark intentionally concluded with this word, it would be one of only a few narratives in antiquity to do so.

Some scholars argue that Mark never intended to end so abruptly: either he planned another ending that was never written, or the original ending has been lost. The references to a future meeting in Galilee between Jesus and the disciples (in Mark 14:28 and 16:7) could suggest that Mark intended to write beyond 16:8. C. H. Turner argued that the original version of the Gospel could have been a codex, with the last page being especially vulnerable to damage. Many scholars, including Rudolf Bultmann, have concluded that the Gospel most likely ended with a Galilean resurrection appearance and the reconciliation of Jesus with the Eleven, even if verses 9–20 were not written by the original author of the Gospel of Mark. Robert Gundry mentions that only about 10% of Mark&#x27;s γαρ clauses (6 out of 66) conclude pericopes. Thus he infers that, rather than concluding 16:1–8, verse 8 begins a new pericope, the rest of which is now lost to us. Gundry therefore does not see verse 8 as the intended ending; a resurrection narrative was either written, then lost, or planned but never actually written.

===Longer ending===

====Later addition====
Most scholars agree that verses 9–20 were not part of the original text of Mark but are a later addition.

Critical questions concerning the authenticity of verses 9–20 (the &quot;longer ending&quot;) often center on stylistic and linguistic issues. On linguistics, E. P. Gould identified 19 of the 163 words in the passage as distinctive and not occurring elsewhere in the Gospel. Dr. Bruce Terry argues that a vocabulary-based case against Mark 16:9–20 is indecisive, inasmuch as other 12-verse sections of Mark contain comparable numbers of once-used words.

Concerning style, the degree to which verses 9–20 aptly fit as an ending for the Gospel remains in question. The turn from verse 8 to 9 has also been seen as abrupt and interrupted: the narrative flows from &quot;they were afraid&quot; to &quot;now after he rose&quot;, and seems to reintroduce Mary Magdalene. Secondly, Mark regularly identifies instances where Jesus&#x27; prophecies are fulfilled, yet Mark does not explicitly state the twice predicted reconciliation of Jesus with his disciples in Galilee (Mark 14:28, 16:7). Lastly, the active voice &quot;he rose&quot; is different from the earlier passive construction &quot;[he] has been risen&quot; of verse 6, seen as significant by some.

====Dating====
Because of patristic evidence from the late 100s for the existence of copies of Mark with 16:9–20, scholars widely date the composition of the longer ending to the early 2nd century.

====Aimed addition or independent longer ending====
Scholars are divided on the question of whether the &quot;Longer Ending&quot; was created deliberately to finish the Gospel of Mark, as contended by James Kelhoffer, or if it began its existence as a freestanding text which was used to &quot;patch&quot; the otherwise abruptly ending text of Mark. Metzger and Ehrman note that
====Intertextuality====
Verses 9–20 share the subject of Jesus&#x27; post-resurrection appearances, and other points, with other passages in the New Testament. This has led some scholars to believe that Mark 16:9–20 is based on the other books of the New Testament, filling in details which were originally lacking from Mark. Jesus&#x27; reference to drinking poison (16:18) does not correspond to a New Testament source, but that miraculous power did appear in Christian literature from the 2nd century CE on.

Julie M. Smith notes that if there was an original ending, &quot;then the Resurrection accounts in Matthew and/or Luke may contain material from Mark’s original ending.

===Shorter ending/conclusio brevior===
The shorter ending appears only in a minimal number of manuscripts as the sole ending. It is a quick summary, which contradicts verse 8. It probably originated in Egypt, and diverges from the style of Mark. The shorter ending appears in a manuscript sometime after the 3rd century.

<text>The Tessar is a photographic lens design conceived by the German physicist Dr. Paul Rudolph in 1902 while he worked at the Zeiss optical company and patented by Zeiss in Germany; the lens type is usually known as the Zeiss Tessar. Since its introduction, millions of &quot;Tessar&quot; and &quot;Tessar&quot;-derived lenses have been manufactured by Zeiss and other manufacturers, and are still produced as excellent intermediate aperture lenses.

The &quot;Tessar&quot; design uses four spherical lens elements in three groups, one positive crown glass element at the front, one negative flint glass element at the center and a negative concave flint glass element cemented with a positive convex crown glass element at the rear.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
Despite common belief, the &quot;Tessar&quot; was not developed from the 1893 Cooke triplet design, although it appears the &quot;Tessar&quot; replaces the single rear element of the Cooke triplet with a cemented achromatic doublet. Instead, the &quot;Tessar&quot; underwent a parallel evolution from Paul Rudolph&#x27;s 1890 &quot;Anastigmat&quot; lens, which had four elements in two cemented groups. Hugh L. Aldis patented the &quot;Stigmatic&quot; lens line for Dallmeyer in 1895; in one implementation, the front group from the &quot;Anastigmat&quot; design was modified by adding a narrow air gap, which acted as a positive element and improved zonal correction. Later, Rudolph adopted the same device to modify the &quot;Anastigmat&quot; design, resulting in the &quot;Unar&quot; of 1899. In addition, this allowed the photographers to have greater freedom when choosing the lenses. In one implementation, the &quot;Unar&quot; has four air-spaced elements in four groups, which replaced the two cemented interfaces of the earlier &quot;Anastigmat&quot; design.

In 1902, Rudolph realized the two cemented interfaces had many virtues, so he reinserted them in the back of his &quot;Anastigmat&quot;, maintaining the &quot;air gap&quot; of the previous part of the &quot;Unar&quot;, thus creating the &quot;Tessar&quot; design (from the Greek word τέσσερα (&quot;téssera&quot;, four) to indicate a design of four elements) of 1902. The frontal element of the &quot;Tessar&quot;, like that of the &quot;Anastigmat&quot;, had little power since its only function was to correct the few aberrations produced by the powerful posterior element. The set of interfaces cemented in the posterior element had 3 functions: to reduce the spherical aberration; reduce the overcorrected spherical-oblique aberration; and reduce the gap found between astigmatic foci.

===Improvements and evolutions===
The first &quot;Tessar&quot; appeared with a maximum aperture of , but by 1917, the maximum aperture had been increased to . In 1930, Ernst Wandersleb and Willy Merté from Zeiss developed &quot;Tessar&quot; lenses with apertures of and .

In 1925, E. Wandersleb and W. Merté of Zeiss created the &quot;Biotessar&quot; consisting of two elements cemented in the front, a single negative element in the center, and three cemented in the rear.

After World War II and the partitioning of Germany, the Zeiss factory at Eisfeld ended up in East Germany; Zeiss Jena developed a popular camera line named the &#x27;Werra&#x27;, after the Werra river which runs through the town. Many models were equipped with &quot;Tessar&quot; lenses, which were marked as &quot;Zeiss-Tessar&quot;, resulting in legal action from the Zeiss company in Western Germany. For a while the Werra Tessar lenses were marked simply as &quot;T&quot;, but eventually they were allowed to market the lenses as &quot;Carl Zeiss Jena Tessar&quot;.
===&quot;Tessar&quot;-derived lenses===

Zeiss had strong control over the &quot;Tessar&quot; design, because Rudolph&#x27;s patent was very general. In the corresponding U.S. Patent, he claimed:&quot;A spherically, chromatically and astigmatically corrected objective, consisting of four lenses separated by the diaphragm into two groups each of two lenses, of which groups one includes a pair of facing surfaces and the other a cemented surface, the power of the pair of facing surfaces being negative and that of the cemented surface positive.&quot;—Paul Rudolph, US Pat. 721,240

The &quot;Tessar&quot; design patent was held by Zeiss for two decades, and licensed to Ross in the United Kingdom, Bausch &amp; Lomb in the United States, and to Krauss in France. Only licensed manufacturers were allowed to use the brand name &quot;Tessar&quot;. Many other manufacturers tried to copy the design of the &quot;Tessar&quot; lenses but due to the breadth of the patent, they could not. The simplest way was to use a cemented triplet for the rear group instead of a doublet. In 1913, many designs of this type appeared, including the Ross &quot;Xpress&quot; by J. Stuart and J.W. Hasselkus, Gundlach &quot;Radar&quot;, and Berthiot &quot;Olor&quot; by Florian.

After the patent expired, &quot;Tessar&quot;-derived lenses were widely made by many manufacturers under different trade names. For example, the &quot;Minoxar&quot; 35/2.8 lens on the Minox M.D.C and GT-E is the fastest and widest &quot;Tessar&quot;-type lens achieved so far by using lanthanum glass elements. The picture quality was outstanding. Other &quot;Tessar&quot;-type lenses include:

* Agfa &quot;Solinar&quot;
* Kodak &quot;Ektar&quot; (some, but not all)
* KMZ &quot;Industar&quot;
* Minolta &quot;Rokkor&quot; 75mm (twin-lens-reflex design)
* Rodenstock &quot;Ysar&quot;
* Schneider &quot;Xenar&quot;
* Voigtländer &quot;Skopar&quot;
* Yashica &quot;Yashinon&quot; 80mm (twin-lens-reflex design)
==== Leitz &quot;Elmar&quot;====

It is sometimes believed the Leitz &quot;Elmar&quot; 50 mm , designed by Max Berek in 1920, was derived from the &quot;Tessar&quot;, as they share the same general layout. The &quot;Elmar&quot; lenses were used in the first Leica cameras.

Although the &quot;Tessar&quot; and &quot;Elmar&quot; lenses appear similar in layout, there is a lot more to the design and performance of a lens than simply the layout of the glass elements. The position of the stop, the optical characteristics of the glasses used for each element, the curvature of each lens surface, and the negative format that the lens is designed to cover, are all vital to the performance of the lens, and in the Leica lens these were all different from the &quot;Tessar&quot;.

When the Leica was being developed, Oskar Barnack tried a 50 mm &quot;Tessar&quot;, but because it had been designed to cover only the 18×24 mm field of a cine frame, he found it inadequate for coverage of the Leica 24×36 mm format. The lens designed by for the Leica rangefinder camera was a modified Cooke triplet with five elements in three groups, the third group being three cemented elements, with the aperture stop in the first air space. This lens, called the &quot;Elmax&quot;, gave good coverage of the 24×36 mm format and was used until improved optical glass allowed the third group to be simplified to a cemented pair when it was renamed &quot;Elmar&quot;. It was not until Zeiss Ikon was developing the Contax camera to compete with the Leica that the &quot;Tessar&quot; was redesigned to cover a 24×36 mm negative.

===Pro Tessar===
The front element of the Tessar can be replaced to make a long-focus or wide-angle lens. In 1957 Carl Zeiss offered the long-focus Pro Tessar 115 mm &quot;f&quot;/4 and 85 mm &quot;f&quot;/4, and the wide-angle Pro Tessar 35 mm &quot;f&quot;/3,2 for use on the central-shutter SLR Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super B cameras.

===Licensed &quot;Tessar&quot; lenses / &quot;Vario-Tessar&quot;===
Other &quot;Tessar&quot; lenses, for example those equipped on certain Nokia mobile phones, have only the name &quot;Tessar&quot; in common with the original &quot;Tessar&quot;, not the four-element, three-group design. They are for example a 5-elements-in-1-group, aperture-less all-aspherical lens, as in the Nokia 808 Pureview and Nokia Lumia 800 camera.

&quot;Vario-Tessar&quot; lenses also only have the name &quot;Tessar&quot; in common with the original &quot;Tessar&quot;. The &quot;Vario-Tessar&quot; name has been used by Zeiss for various zoom lenses fitted to Sony cameras, including that of the digital still cameras Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P100, DSC-P200, and DSC-W330 as well as the E-mount lenses such as Sony Alpha Carl Zeiss &quot;Vario-Tessar&quot; T* E 4/16-70mm ZA OSS (Sony SEL-1670Z) and Sony Alpha Carl Zeiss &quot;Vario-Tessar&quot; T* FE 4/16-35mm ZA OSS. Sony also uses &quot;Vario-Tessar&quot; lens branding for their consumer camcorders such as the HDR-CX405 extending the wide angle view with 1.9mm to 57mm zoom range.

==Design==

===Common uses===
&quot;Tessar&quot; lenses are frequently found in mid-range cameras, as they can provide a very good optical performance at a reasonable price, and are often quite compact. They are also frequently used in photographic enlargers, as they provide more contrast than many competing lens designs due to the limited number of air-to-glass surfaces.

===Focusing methods===
All lenses can be focused by moving the lens assembly towards or away from the film (&quot;unit focusing&quot;), and the &quot;Tessar&quot; is no exception. Unit-focusing Tessars were used on higher-end cameras such as the Contaflex Super B, Rolleiflex TLR, and larger-format plate cameras such as the Maximar.

Some lenses, including &quot;Tessars&quot;, can be focused by moving lens elements relative to each other; this usually worsens optical performance to some extent, but is cheaper to implement. As the front element of the &quot;Tessar&quot; has three times the power of the whole lens, it must be moved one-third of the distance that the whole lens would need to move to focus at the same point. The large airspace between the first and second elements allows focusing by moving the front element only; as the displacement is small compared with the airspace, the adverse effect on image performance is not severe. The front-element-focusing &quot;Tessar&quot;, cheaper than a unit-focusing lens, was widely used in many midrange Zeiss Ikon cameras.

<text>The A41 is a trunk road between London and Birkenhead, England. Now in parts replaced by motorways, it passes through or near Watford, Kings Langley, Hemel Hempstead, Aylesbury, Bicester, Solihull, Birmingham, West Bromwich, Wolverhampton, Newport, Whitchurch, Chester and Ellesmere Port.

With the opening of the M40 extension in 1990 from junction 8, much of the route was downgraded. The sections between Bicester and the M42 near Solihull in the Midlands have been re-classified B4100, A4177 and A4141.

== Route ==
=== London to Kings Langley ===
The route begins at Marble Arch from its junction on the A40 road in London with Portman Street/Gloucester Place (northbound) and Baker Street/Orchard Street (southbound). Named the Finchley Road, the A41 is dual-carriageway through Swiss Cottage and Hendon Way and intersects with the North Circular Road near Brent Cross shopping centre. The road passes through Hendon and after the junction with the A5150, (close to the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s police college and the RAF Museum). The A41 overlaps the A1 at &quot;Five Ways Corner&quot; with the section known as &quot;Watford Way&quot;. It passes through Mill Hill, separating with the A1 at &quot;Apex Corner&quot; roundabout After crossing the M1, near Elstree, it links the M1 at Junction 4, and then meets the A5 at a roundabout (where the A5 becomes the A5183). The A41 continues alongside the M1 into Hertfordshire. This section is known as &quot;Elton Way&quot;, as far as the roundabout with the B462.

Running parallel to the M1, it intersects with junction 5 (Berrygrove Interchange). The road continues north, passing over the River Colne, to the east of Watford, crossing the A412 near Garston at &quot;the Dome roundabout&quot;. After passing under the junction with the A405, the A41 turns towards the west. At a roundabout, with the A411 to Watford to the south, and the M25 spur straight ahead to join the M25 westbound at junction 19, the A41 continues north through Hunton Bridge crossing the River Gade and the Grand Union Canal to meet the M25 at junction 20. The old route through Kings Langley is now classified A4251. It used to follow the route of the Roman road, Akeman Street, between Berkhamsted and Bicester. The London to Aylesbury section was a similar route to the Sparrows Herne Turnpike Road.

=== Kings Langley to Tring ===

North of the M25, the road is a near motorway standard &quot;A&quot; road with all junctions grade-separated via underpasses or flyovers, but curves and gradients a little steeper. There are no hard shoulders but frequent lay-bys. It climbs through the Chiltern Hills then descends into the valley of the River Bulbourne crossing water meadows just outside Hemel Hempstead at Boxmoor. There are grade-separated junctions with the A414, A4251 (the earlier route of the A41) and A416. The route returns to open country north of here, passing west of Berkhamsted. It passes the National Film Archive. Before Tring, near Wigginton, it crosses the Icknield Way Path and Chiltern Way. An arched footbridge spans the road just near the summit before it passes just east of Tring (for the Ridgeway footpath) and descends the Chiltern scarp into the Vale of Aylesbury.

The Tring bypass was built in 1973 as the first section of the Watford-Aylesbury A41(M) motorway. On 6 July 1987, this section was downgraded to A41. The Tring bypass ends with the junction with the B4635, B4009 (the former route through Aston Clinton) and B488.

The A41 from junction 20 of the M25 to the Tring bypass was built in the early 1990s and opened in two sections: the £23.9million Berkhamsted bypass opened September 1993 and the £32.7million Kings Langley bypass opened August 1993.

=== Tring to Bicester ===

On 3 October 2003, the dual carriageway section was extended to the £25m Aston Clinton Bypass, which was originally intended to be built at the same time as the two sections further south. It enters Buckinghamshire and the district of Aylesbury Vale. It crosses the Grand Union Canal, and there is a junction with the B489, and finishes at a roundabout, becoming &quot;Aston Clinton Road&quot;. The road goes straight through Aylesbury, which is a bottleneck. It meets the A4157 at a junction as &quot;Tring Road&quot;, and the next roundabout is near Aylesbury Grammar School and a Tesco. It meets the A418 ring-road and becomes &quot;Exchange Street&quot;, then meets the A413 from Wendover at a roundabout and becomes &quot;Friarage Road&quot;, passing close to a Morrisons and the railway station. The A418 turns to the left and A41 continues straight ahead to become &quot;Gatehouse Road&quot;, then at the next roundabout, it leaves to left as &quot;Bicester Road&quot; near the Applegreen &quot;Aylesbury Service Station&quot;. After four roundabouts, it crosses the River Thame. It then meets a roundabout with access for the new &quot;Berryfields&quot; development as well as Aylesbury Vale Parkway before passing under a railway line, then through Waddesdon, then passes close to Westcott near the former airfield of RAF Westcott. At Kingswood, it passes the &quot;Crooked Billet&quot; (now the &quot;Akeman Inn&quot;) and &quot;Plough and Anchor&quot; (now an Italian restaurant) pubs. It enters Oxfordshire and the district of Cherwell, and at Blackthorn it crosses the River Ray and meets a low bridge which was originally a limit but due to bridge strikes, the road was lowered and the bridge now has a limit.

=== Bicester to Solihull ===

The £5.7m first stage of the Bicester bypass opened in November 1990, with the £3.9m second stage (part of the A421 section to Wendlebury) opened in May 1993, and has many roundabouts. Since 1993, the road now heads south-west where it officially becomes part of the M40 at junction 9, meeting with the A34 (which also overlaps the M40 to Birmingham – to draw traffic off the previous routes). The former route went through Warwick. From here to the M42, the original route is now mainly designated as the B4100 (multiplexing at points with the current A361 and A422 through Banbury, plus the A452 and A425 approaching and through Warwick) followed by the A4177 and A4141, the latter two both excellent wide roads. At junction 5 of the M42, the A41 follows its old course. Further north, the road bypasses Solihull and goes through the city centres of Birmingham and Wolverhampton. This renumbering took place in 1991. The A4141 and B4100 are new designations, while the A4177 is an extension of an existing route.

=== Solihull to Wolverhampton ===

The road manifests from the junction which opened in November 1976 with the A4141 and M42 near Berry Hall Farm, and crosses the River Blythe and bypasses Solihull. The former route through Solihull is now the B4025 and B425, which passes Solihull School. The A41 has a staggered junction with the B4102 (for Solihull and Catherine-de-Barnes) near the BUPA Parkway Hospital. At Lode Heath, there is crossroads with the B425 (for Solihull Hospital) where the road is the &quot;Seven Star Road&quot;. The A41 resumes the old route at another junction with the B425, becoming &quot;Warwick Road&quot;, which is the name of the route all the way into Birmingham. At Worlds End there is the Shell Solihull garage on the left. Next is Ulverley Green and it passes the BP Mereside garage on the right and passes under the Chiltern Main Line (for Leamington) near Olton station, Olton Library and Olton Reservoir. At the junction with the B4514, there is a Tesco petrol station and the road enters the city of Birmingham. The B4514 leads onto Olton Boulevard and can be used to bypass Acocks Green, although there is one section to be completed near Sparkhill. It passes Archbishop Ilsley Catholic School at Acocks Green, then meets the B4146 and B4217 at a roundabout near a Sainsburys. It meets the A4040 ring road at a staggered junction and crosses the Birmingham -Stratford Line near Tyseley station and the Tyseley Locomotive Works. At Sparkhill, it crosses the River Cole and meets the B4145 at a roundabout near Golden Hillock School. At Sparkbrook, it meets the A34 &quot;Stratford Road&quot; and there is a crossroads with the A4540 and B4126. The two main routes overlap around central Birmingham and meet The Middleway (A4540) inner ring road. The former route of the A41 through inner Birmingham is now the B4100 heading past the National Express Birmingham coach station, and passes near St Chad&#x27;s RC Cathedral. The A41 previously resumed at Constitution Hill near Snow Hill train station but following downgrading of much of the former Inner Ring Road, resumes in Hockley where it meets the northern section of the A4540. (The section from the A4540 to city centre is another part of the B4100). There is a staggered junction with the A4040 as the road passes through Handsworth (at this point known as Soho Road) which is a particular bottleneck with narrow lanes, on-street parking, bad drivers and several close-set junctions, often very badly congested. Just before The Hawthorns football stadium, home of West Bromwich Albion F.C., it leaves Birmingham and enters the borough of Sandwell. It meets the M5 at junction 1, where it also meets the A4252.

In 2004, there were plans to re-route the road between Birmingham &amp; West Bromwich along the current A457 via Smethwick &amp; up to the M5 at Junction 1 along the current A4252. These plans were scrapped soon after. It bypasses West Bromwich on a dual-carriageway called the &quot;Expressway&quot;, which opened in 1973. There is a grade separated roundabout with the A4031. The grade separated roundabout opened over 20 years after the Expressway, relieving what had been a major bottleneck. At the next roundabout, the A41 follows a new route with the original route (Old Meeting Street) being designated as the A4196.

The new route opened in 1995 and is called the Black Country New Road, and crosses the West Midlands Metro tram line near Guns Village. There is a roundabout with the B4149 at Swan Village. From the roundabout with the A461 (for Dudley) at Great Bridge, it overlaps the A461 (to Walsall), crosses the Tame Valley Canal, meets the A4037 at a roundabout and goes under the West Midlands Metro near Wednesbury Parkway tram stop. The A461 heads off to junction 9 of the M6 and Walsall. The A41 follows the old route from the next roundabout and enters the borough of Walsall. At the junction with the A4444 (the final phase of the Black Country New Road) it crosses the Walsall Canal.

There are junctions with the A4098 (where the road enters the borough of Wolverhampton) and B4163. The road goes straight through the middle of Bilston, where it meets the dual-carriageway A463 Black Country Route at a busy roundabout. Close by is the Bilston Central tram stop, near Morrisons. There is a junction with the B4484 (for the A454) near The Crescent tram stop. At Priestfield, it meets the B4162, and passes the City of Wolverhampton College Wellington Road Campus (Bilston) near Priestfield tram stop. From here, the West Midlands Metro runs down the centre of the road. There is a signalised junction with the A4126 (trams and buses use the nearside lane towards Wolverhampton) and the road passes under the Wolverhampton loop of the West Coast Main Line at Monmore Green, and crosses the Birmingham Canal. It overlaps the A4150 Wolverhampton Ring Road, then passes West Park Hospital and crosses the Staffordshire &amp; Worcestershire Canal. It passes through Tettenhall, past Tettenhall College.

=== Wolverhampton to Newport ===
After leaving the borough of Wolverhampton, it crosses the River Penk, then runs into Staffordshire passing Perton, Codsall and the golf course at Wrottesley Hall. Next is a junction with the A464 (for Shifnal), and the road enters Shropshire. It crosses the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury Line on the Albrighton bypass. The road passes close by the RAF Museum at Cosford. After junction 3 of the M54 motorway, the road passes through Tong. The road meets the A5 at a roundabout, which is on the border with Staffordshire. At Weston Heath, there is a junction with the B5314. At the junction of the B4379, the road enters Telford and Wrekin. The £6m Newport bypass opened in early 1985. The former route went through Chetwynd Aston. The A41 meets the A518 for Telford at a roundabout, followed by another roundabout with the A518 for travelling east, and then a roundabout with the A519 and the B5062.

=== Newport to Whitchurch ===

The road rejoins the old route and passes Chetwynd Park. The £1.5m Hinstock Bypass opened in late 1983. The day before the bypass opened for traffic, a Hinstock local named David Williams flew his Saab 91D Safir airplane under the Pixley Lane bridge in an unsanctioned stunt. The road then passes through Standford, Standford Bridge and over the River Meese. It passes High Heath, Shakeford, Crickmery which is near Wistanswick. Nearby is the former wartime fighter base RAF Ternhill, now an army base known as Clive Barracks. The road crosses the River Tern, meets the A53 at a roundabout at Ternhill. After Bletchley Manor, there is of dual carriageway. The road passes through Prees Higher Heath near a former airfield (RAF Tilstock), and meets the A49 at a roundabout near Tilstock. The £13.7m Whitchurch Bypass opened in July 1992, where the road meets the A49.

=== Whitchurch to Birkenhead ===

The final stretch of the road leaves Shropshire and heads north through Cheshire on a modern alignment bypassing the villages of Tushingham cum Grindley and No Mans Heath before reaching a nineteenth century bypass of the stagecoach road through Broxton. The road crosses the A534 at Broxton Roundabout before passing Beeston, Bolesworth and Peckforton Castles. The road bypasses Chester, before running through the suburbs of Ellesmere Port (where the road was downgraded for safety reasons in the early 1990s). It heads to junction 5 of the M53 motorway and the Merseyside county boundary at Hooton. From this junction it is named New Chester Road, passing through Eastham and Bromborough. At Port Sunlight the A41 diverts onto a dual-carriageway section bypassing New Ferry and Rock Ferry before rejoining New Chester Road at Tranmere Oil Terminal. After passing Green Lane railway station, a spur of the A41 separates at the southern approach to the Queensway Tunnel, which passes under the River Mersey and enters Liverpool to meet the start of the A59.

The road then passes a junction with the A554 near Hamilton Square railway station, terminating at the bus station at Woodside. The end of the road has views over the Mersey to Liverpool and transport links to Mersey Ferry services.

== History of the road number ==

The original (1923) route was Stanmore north-west of London to Oakengates, west of Wolverhampton, in Shropshire, meeting the A5 at both ends.

The A41 was extended by numbering as follows:

The northern extension dates from 1935; in Shropshire, it swapped with a combination of the A464/A529; from Kingswood Common to Nantwich, Cheshire and the original A529 ran from Hinstock to Chester. North of Chester, the A41 replaced part of the A51.

The southern extension dates from after the Second World War using Watford Way which opened in about 1930 as the A5088. In the remaining years after 1935, it was renumbered A500.

<text>Akeman Street is a Roman road in southern England between the modern counties of Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire. It is approximately long and runs roughly east–west.

Akeman Street linked Watling Street just north of Verulamium (near modern St Albans) with the Fosse Way at Corinium Dobunnorum (now Cirencester). Evidence suggests that the route may well have been an older track, metalled and reorganised by the Romans. Its course passes through towns and villages including Hemel Hempstead, Berkhamsted, Tring, Aylesbury, Alchester (outside modern Bicester), Stonesfield (where a large Roman villa was discovered around 1712), Chesterton, Kirtlington, Ramsden and Asthall.

Parts of the A41 road between Berkhamsted and Bicester use the course of the former Roman road, as did the Sparrows Herne turnpike between Berkhamsted and Aylesbury. A minor road between Chesterton and Kirtlington also uses its course. Other parts are in use as public footpaths, including a stretch between Tackley and Stonesfield that is part of the Oxfordshire Way.

<text>Layne Thomas Staley (born Layne Rutherford Staley; August 22, 1967 – April 5, 2002) was an American singer and songwriter who was the original lead vocalist of Alice in Chains, which rose to international fame in the early 1990s as part of Seattle&#x27;s grunge movement. He was known for his distinctive vocal style as well as his harmonizing with bandmate Jerry Cantrell. Prior to his success with Alice in Chains, Staley was also a member of the glam metal bands Sleze and Alice N&#x27; Chains. He was also a part of the supergroups Mad Season and Class of &#x27;99.

&quot;Man in the Box&quot;, the second single from Alice in Chains&#x27; debut album, &quot;Facelift&quot; (1990), garnered Staley critical recognition for his vocal style. Alice in Chains&#x27; EP &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; (1994), debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Alice in Chains&#x27; first record—and the first-ever EP—to top the chart. However, Staley&#x27;s deteriorating condition due to heroin abuse led him to enter a rehabilitation clinic. He began to work on a side project with several Seattle musicians, Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees, and John Baker Saunders of The Walkabouts, which came to be Mad Season, while Alice in Chains went into hiatus.

During Alice in Chains&#x27; hiatus, reports of Staley&#x27;s drug addiction began to gain widespread circulation in fan and media communities, in part due to changes in his physical condition brought on by prolonged heroin abuse. On April 10, 1996, the band returned with a performance on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; in New York; it was Alice in Chains&#x27; first concert in two-and-a-half years. The band performed three more shows, supporting Kiss on their reunion tour, with Staley&#x27;s final live performance on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri. Aside from recording two more songs with Alice in Chains – &quot;Get Born Again&quot; and &quot;Died&quot; – and a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; with Class of &#x27;99 during 1998, Staley was out of the public spotlight by the late 1990s. 

Staley struggled with drug addiction for much of his adult life; he later died from a speedball overdose on April 5, 2002, at the age of 34. He was ranked at No. 27 on &quot;Hit Parader&quot;″s list of &quot;Heavy Metal&#x27;s All-Time Top 100 Vocalists&quot; in 2006, and at No. 42 on &quot;Complex&quot;&#x27;s magazine list of &quot;The 50 Best Lead Singers of All Time&quot; in 2012. Seattle officially declared August 22, 2019, as &quot;Layne Staley Day.&quot; Staley earned six Grammy Award nominations as a member of Alice in Chains.

== Early life ==

Staley was born as Layne Rutherford Staley on August 22, 1967, at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, Washington to Phillip Blair Staley and Nancy Elizabeth Staley (née Layne; later McCallum). Staley disliked his middle name &quot;Rutherford&quot; and would get angry every time someone called him by this name. He legally changed his middle name to &quot;Thomas&quot; during his teens because he was a fan of Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee.

Staley joined a rhythm band in Bellevue when he was two or three years old, and was the youngest in the group. At nine years old, he wrote in his Dr. Seuss book, &quot;All About Me,&quot; that he wanted to be a singer.

Staley was seven years old when his parents divorced, after which he was raised by his mother and stepfather, Jim Elmer. He took his stepfather&#x27;s surname while enrolled in Meadowdale High School in Lynnwood, and was known for some time as Layne Elmer.

Staley was raised as a Christian Scientist. However, he was critical of religion in his adult life, stating in a 1991 interview: 
&quot;I have a fascination with how brainwashed people get with religion and how they&#x27;ll give up their money, their time and their whole life for a cause that they&#x27;re sure is right, but I&#x27;m sure is wrong. I think there&#x27;s a lot of people who are scared of life and living and they want to make sure they get to Heaven or whatever. I try to stay away from it as much as I can. I was raised in the church until I was 16 and I&#x27;ve disagreed with their beliefs as long as I can remember, so when I had the choice I chose not to believe in anything apart from myself.&quot; Staley also stated in a 1999 interview that the song &quot;Get Born Again&quot; is about &quot;religious hypocrisy&quot;.

He approached music through his parents&#x27; collection, listening to Black Sabbath (regarded by him as his first influence) and Deep Purple. Other favorite bands include hard rock and metal bands like The Stooges, Anthrax, Judas Priest, Saxon, Rainbow, Mercyful Fate, Twisted Sister, Van Halen, and industrial/new wave acts such as Ministry, The Lords of the New Church and Skinny Puppy. He also cited Prince and David Bowie as two of his biggest idols.

Staley began playing drums at age 12; he played in several glam bands in his early teens, but by this point, Staley had aspirations of becoming a singer. In 1984, Staley joined a group of Shorewood High students in a band called Sleze, which also featured future members of The Dehumanizers and Second Coming.

In 1985, Staley and his band Sleze made a cameo in &quot;Father Rock&quot;, a low-budget movie from Seattle&#x27;s Public Access Channel. In 1986, Sleze morphed into Alice N&#x27; Chains, a band which Staley said &quot;dressed in drag and played speed metal.&quot; The new band performed around the Seattle area playing Slayer and Armored Saint covers.

==Career==
===Alice in Chains and Mad Season===
Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a party in Seattle while working at Music Bank rehearsal studios in 1987. A few months before that, Cantrell had watched Staley performing with his then-band, &quot;Alice N&#x27; Chains&quot;, in his hometown at the Tacoma Little Theatre, and was impressed by his voice. Cantrell was homeless after being kicked out of his family&#x27;s house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the Music Bank. The two fast friends lived as roommates for over a year in the dilapidated rehearsal space they shared.

Alice N&#x27; Chains soon disbanded and Staley joined a funk band, which at the time also required a guitarist. He asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band, which at the time did not have a name and included drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr. They started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint, which made him angry. The final straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper in front of him – he decided to join the band after that. Cantrell said this about Staley&#x27;s voice: &quot;I knew that voice was the guy I wanted to be playing with. It sounded like it came out of a 350-pound biker rather than skinny little Layne. I considered his voice to be my voice.&quot; Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987, Staley joined Cantrell&#x27;s band on a full-time basis. The band had names like &quot;Fuck&quot; and &quot;Diamond Lie&quot;, the latter being the name of Cantrell&#x27;s previous band.

Two weeks after the band&#x27;s formation, they were playing a gig at the University of Washington, trying to fill in a 40-minute set with a couple of original songs along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers. Diamond Lie gained attention in the Seattle area and eventually took the name of Staley&#x27;s previous band, &quot;Alice N&#x27; Chains&quot;, then renamed &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;. Staley got permission from his former bandmates to use the name.

Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of Alice in Chains at a concert and offered to pay for demo recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid in the history of the state. The final demo, completed in 1988, was named &quot;The Treehouse Tapes&quot; and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band Soundgarden. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records&#x27; A&amp;R representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Ienner. Based on &quot;The Treehouse Tapes&quot;, Terzo signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989. The band also recorded another untitled demo over a three-month period in 1989. This recording can be found on the bootleg release &quot;Sweet Alice&quot;.
Alice in Chains released its debut album &quot;Facelift&quot; on August 21, 1990, shaping the band&#x27;s signature style. The second single, &quot;Man in the Box&quot;, with lyrics written by Staley, became a huge hit. &quot;Man in the Box&quot; is widely recognized for its distinctive &quot;wordless opening melody, where Staley&#x27;s peculiar, tensed-throat vocals are matched in unison with an effects-laden guitar&quot; followed by &quot;portentous lines like: &#x27;Jesus Christ/Deny your maker&#x27; and &#x27;He who tries/Will be wasted&#x27; with Cantrell&#x27;s drier, and less-urgent voice.&quot;

&quot;Facelift&quot; has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA for sales of two million copies in the United States. The band toured in support of the album for two years before releasing the acoustic EP &quot;Sap&quot; in early 1992. Alice in Chains made a cameo in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Singles&quot;, performing the songs &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Like That&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot;.

In September 1992, Alice in Chains released &quot;Dirt&quot;. The critically acclaimed album, also the band&#x27;s most successful, debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified quadruple platinum. Staley designed the sun logo on the album&#x27;s inlay. During the &quot;Dirt&quot; tour in Brazil in 1993, Staley saved Starr&#x27;s life after he had overdosed. Because of Staley&#x27;s drug addiction, the band did not tour in support of &quot;Dirt&quot; for very long.

Cantrell wrote almost all of the music and lyrics for Alice in Chains, but as time went on, Staley contributed more lyrics. Eventually, Staley would receive credit for about half the lyrics from the entire Alice in Chains catalog prior to the release of &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; in 2009. He also wrote the music and the lyrics to &quot;Hate to Feel&quot;, &quot;Angry Chair&quot; and &quot;Head Creeps&quot;, and melodies to other songs. Staley&#x27;s lyrics are largely viewed as having dealt with his personal troubles, such as drug use and depression. Staley also played guitar on &quot;Angry Chair&quot; and &quot;Hate to Feel&quot;. Cantrell said of &quot;Angry Chair&quot; on the liner notes of the 1999 &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set:

In 1994, Alice in Chains released their third EP, &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;. It debuted at number one, making it the first Alice in Chains release—and the first-ever EP—to do so. The other members of Alice in Chains, seeing Staley&#x27;s deteriorating condition, opted not to tour in support of &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;. Following the album&#x27;s release, Staley entered a rehabilitation clinic and began to work on a side project with several Seattle musicians, Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees and John Baker Saunders of The Walkabouts. The band worked on material for several months and played its first show on October 12, 1994, at the Crocodile Cafe in Seattle under the name &quot;The Gacy Bunch&quot;. Within a few weeks, the band changed its name to Mad Season. In January 1995, Mad Season performed two songs on Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Self-Pollution&quot; satellite radio broadcast, &quot;Lifeless Dead&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anything&quot;. The band completed an album, titled &quot;Above&quot;, which was released in March 1995. The first single, &quot;River of Deceit&quot;, became a modest success on alternative radio. A live performance filmed at the Moore Theatre in Seattle was released in August 1995 as a home video, &quot;Live at the Moore&quot;.

During Alice in Chains&#x27; hiatus, reports of Staley&#x27;s addiction began to gain widespread circulation in fan and media communities, in part due to changes in his physical condition brought on by prolonged heroin abuse.

Alice in Chains regrouped to record &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;Tripod&quot;, which was released in November 1995. The album debuted at the top of the U.S. charts, and has since been awarded — along with &quot;Facelift&quot; and &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; — double platinum status. With the exceptions of &quot;Grind&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, and &quot;Over Now&quot;, the lyrics were all written by Staley, making this album his greatest lyrical contribution to the band&#x27;s catalog. To accompany the album, the band released a home video, &quot;The Nona Tapes&quot;, but the band lapsed again, failing to complete tours planned in support of the album. When asked about the frustration of not touring to support the record, Cantrell provided some insight into how Staley&#x27;s addictions led to tensions within the band: &quot;Very frustrating, but we stuck it out. We rode the good times together, and we stuck together through the hard times. We never stabbed each other in the back and spilled our guts and [did] that kind of bullshit that you see happen a lot.&quot; &quot;Drugs worked for me for years&quot;, Staley told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in February 1996, &quot;and now they&#x27;re turning against me, now I&#x27;m walking through hell and this sucks. I didn&#x27;t want my fans to think that heroin was cool. But then I&#x27;ve had fans come up to me and give me the thumbs up, telling me they&#x27;re high. That&#x27;s exactly what I didn&#x27;t want to happen.&quot;

One of Staley&#x27;s last shows with Alice in Chains was the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance in New York on April 10, 1996. The recording of &quot;Unplugged&quot; came after a long period of inactivity for the band; it was their first concert in two-and-a-half years. Staley made his last performance on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri, while Alice in Chains was touring with Kiss.

==Other projects==
Staley shared lead vocals with Ann Wilson for a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;, featured on Heart&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Desire Walks On&quot;.

The song &quot;It&#x27;s Coming After&quot; from Second Coming&#x27;s 1994 debut album &quot;L.O.V.Evil&quot; features Staley on lead vocals. Second Coming features Staley&#x27;s bandmates from Alice N&#x27; Chains, his former band.

One of the last songs that Staley recorded was a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; with the supergroup Class of &#x27;99, featuring guitarist Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, bassist Martyn LeNoble, drummer Stephen Perkins, both from Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Porno for Pyros, and keyboardist Matt Serletic. In November 1998, the group recorded the song for Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s 1998 horror/sci-fi film &quot;The Faculty&quot;. A music video was also released. While the other members of the band were filmed specifically for the video, Staley&#x27;s appearance consisted of footage pulled from Mad Season&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Live at the Moore&quot; video.

A song titled &quot;Things You Do&quot; featuring Staley on vocals was part of the soundtrack to the 2012 film &quot;Grassroots&quot;. In the film, the song was credited to &quot;The Bondage Boys featuring Layne Staley&quot;, but the song had been credited to &quot;Layne Staley and The Aftervibes&quot; and &quot;Layne Staley and Second Coming&quot; when it leaked on the internet years before.

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, Staley enrolled in several rehab programs, but he failed to stay clean for long. At one point, the other members of Alice in Chains flew to Los Angeles for weekly therapy at Staley&#x27;s rehab. During the &quot;Dirt&quot; tour, Alice in Chains&#x27; manager, Susan Silver, hired bodyguards to keep Staley away from people who might try to pass him drugs, but he ended up relapsing on alcohol and drugs during the tour. Screaming Trees&#x27; Mark Lanegan recalled partying with Staley on tour and said that, &quot;off stage, it was an insane, dark, drug and alcohol-fuelled frat party from start to finish, with Layne [Staley] and I raising hell, behaving like teenagers, staying up for days on end. We partook of whatever drugs came our way. Heroin, cocaine, painkillers, anything.&quot; Kurt Cobain&#x27;s death in April 1994 scared Staley into temporary sobriety, but soon he was back into his addiction. Alice in Chains&#x27; managers turned down lucrative touring possibilities and kept the band off the road, hoping that would help Staley. Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready also tried to help Staley by inviting him to his side project, Mad Season. McCready had hoped that playing with sober musicians would encourage Staley.
On October 29, 1996, Staley&#x27;s former fiancée, Demri Lara Parrott, died of a drug related heart condition. Staley was placed on a 24-hour suicide watch, according to &quot;NME&quot;, which quoted a friend saying Staley was taking Parrott&#x27;s death &quot;extremely badly&quot; and had fallen into a deep depression. Lanegan told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2002, &quot;He never recovered from Demri&#x27;s death. After that, I don&#x27;t think he wanted to go on.&quot;

== Final years: 1997–2002 ==
On February 26, 1997, Staley and the other members of Alice in Chains attended the Grammy Awards after the song &quot;Again&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance. In April of that same year, Staley purchased a , three-bedroom condominium in Seattle&#x27;s University District via a trust. Toby Wright, the producer of Alice in Chains&#x27; third album, set up a home recording system for him there.

In 1998, amid rumors that Staley rarely left his apartment, had contracted gangrene, and had lost the ability to ingest food and was living on a diet of Ensure, Jerry Cantrell told &quot;Kerrang!&quot; that the members of Alice in Chains regularly hung out at Staley&#x27;s house. On June 22, 1998, Staley made a phone call to radio program Rockline and gave a rare interview while Cantrell was promoting his first solo album, &quot;Boggy Depot&quot;. Staley called the show to talk to Cantrell and stated that he had loved the album.

In October 1998, Staley re-emerged to record two tracks with Alice in Chains, &quot;Get Born Again&quot; and &quot;Died&quot;, which were released on the &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set in 1999. Additional reports of Staley&#x27;s deteriorating condition persisted in the midst of the sessions. &quot;Dirt&quot; producer Dave Jerden—originally chosen by the band for the production—said, &quot;Staley weighed 80 pounds…and was white as a ghost.&quot; Studio engineer Elan Trujillo commented that Layne &quot;definitely didn&#x27;t look like how he used to look&quot; and noticed Staley had, in addition to no teeth, atrophy in his legs. Cantrell refused to comment on the singer&#x27;s appearance, and band manager Susan Silver said she had not seen him since &quot;last year&quot;.

Staley made his final public appearance on October 31, 1998, when he attended a Jerry Cantrell solo concert in Seattle. He declined Cantrell&#x27;s request to sing with him on stage. A photo taken of Staley backstage at this show is the most recent photo of him that has been publicly released.

Thereafter, Staley was thought to have left behind his &quot;self-imposed rock &amp; roll exile&quot;, when in November 1998 he laid down additional vocal tracks as part of a supergroup called Class of &#x27;99, featuring members of Rage Against the Machine, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, and Porno for Pyros.

On July 19, 1999, the radio program &quot;Rockline&quot; was hosting Cantrell, Inez, and Kinney for a discussion on the release of &quot;Nothing Safe: Best of the Box&quot;, when, unexpectedly, Staley called in to participate. This was Staley&#x27;s last interview.

From 1999 to 2002, Staley became more reclusive and depressed, rarely leaving his Seattle condo; little is known about the details of his life during this period. Staley was rumored to spend most of his days creating art, playing video games, or nodding off on drugs. Staley&#x27;s one-time roommate and friend Morgen Gallagher later said that around 2001 Staley said he was asked to audition for Audioslave; this claim was later debunked by Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello.

Staley&#x27;s mother, Nancy McCallum, told &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; in 2007 that despite his isolation, he was never far from the love of his family and friends, who filled his answering machine and mailbox with messages and letters. &quot;Just because he was isolated doesn&#x27;t mean we didn&#x27;t have sweet moments with him.&quot; McCallum has also claimed that she saw Staley on Thanksgiving of 2001, and again just around Valentine&#x27;s Day of 2002, when he visited his sister&#x27;s baby. This was the last time that McCallum saw her son. Sean Kinney has commented on Staley&#x27;s final years and isolation period:

Staley&#x27;s physical appearance had become even worse than before: he had lost several teeth, his skin was sickly pale, and he was severely emaciated. Close friends such as Matt Fox said, &quot;If no one heard from him for weeks, it wasn&#x27;t unusual&quot;. Staley grew increasingly disconnected from his friends and bandmates who repeatedly tried to get him into rehab, but Staley refused. Staley&#x27;s close friend Mark Lanegan said, &quot;He didn&#x27;t speak to anybody as of late… It&#x27;s been a few months since I talked to him. But for us to not talk for a few months is par for the course.&quot;

==Death==
On April 17, 2002, Staley&#x27;s mother Nancy McCallum went to his apartment to let him know about the death of Demri Parrott&#x27;s brother, but there was no answer. On April 19, 2002, Staley&#x27;s accountants contacted his former manager, Susan Silver, and informed her that no money had been withdrawn from the singer&#x27;s bank account in two weeks. Silver then contacted McCallum, who went to his apartment again. There was some mail by his door. Staley owned a cat named Sadie at the time, who was usually quiet; upon hearing Sadie meow, McCallum became worried the animal was distressed and that Staley might be in trouble. Still not receiving an answer from Staley, McCallum called 911 to say she had not heard from him &quot;in about two weeks&quot;. She entered the apartment with police and her ex-husband, Jim Elmer. It was reported that the Staley weighed only when his body was discovered. Staley&#x27;s body was partially decomposed when he was found. Medical examiners had to identify the body by comparing dental records. 

The autopsy and toxicology report on Staley&#x27;s body revealed that he died from a mixture of heroin and cocaine, known as a speedball. The autopsy concluded that Staley died two weeks before his body was found, on April 5—the same day fellow grunge musician Kurt Cobain died eight years prior. Staley&#x27;s death was classified as &quot;accidental&quot;. Staley&#x27;s Alice in Chains bandmates issued the following statement:

It&#x27;s good to be with friends and family as we struggle to deal with this immense loss … and try to celebrate this immense life. We are looking for all the usual things: comfort, purpose, answers, something to hold on to, a way to let him go in peace. Mostly, we are feeling heartbroken over the death of our beautiful friend. He was a sweet man with a keen sense of humor and a deep sense of humanity. He was an amazing musician, an inspiration, and a comfort to so many. He made great music and gifted it to the world. We are proud to have known him, to be his friend, and to create music with him. For the past decade, Layne struggled greatly—we can only hope that he has at last found some peace. We love you, Layne. Dearly. And we will miss you … endlessly.

In 2010, in an interview on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; with McCallum, former Alice in Chains bass player Mike Starr said that he was the last person to see Staley alive and had spent time with him the day before his death, on Starr&#x27;s birthday, April 4. Starr claimed that Staley was very sick but would not call 911. They briefly argued, which ended with Starr storming out. Starr stated that Staley called after him as he left and said: &quot;Not like this, don&#x27;t leave like this.&quot; Starr expressed regret for not calling 911 to save his life, and said that Staley had threatened to sever their friendship if he did. Starr regretted being high on benzodiazepines that night and having walked out of the door. McCallum was insistent that neither she nor anyone in her family blamed Starr for Staley&#x27;s death. She also told Starr: &quot;Layne would forgive you. He&#x27;d say, &#x27;Hey, I did this. Not you.&#x27;&quot; 

Starr still blamed himself for the death of Staley, and had kept the story a secret until his appearance on &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;. During this same interview, McCallum said that Staley had attempted rehab 14 times, although it is not clear whether any of these attempts were during his reclusive years. Starr was found dead on March 8, 2011, as a result of prescription drug overdose.

===Aftermath===
An informal memorial was held for Staley on the night of April 20, 2002, at the Seattle Center, which was attended by at least 100 fans and friends, including Alice in Chains bandmates Cantrell, Starr, Inez and Kinney, and Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. Fans continue to leave memorial messages on a wall outside of Staley&#x27;s University District home. Staley&#x27;s body was cremated and a private memorial service was held for him on April 28, 2002, on Bainbridge Island in Washington&#x27;s Puget Sound. During her appearance on &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; in 2010, Staley&#x27;s mother said she has her son&#x27;s ashes in a box. Staley&#x27;s private memorial was attended by his family and friends, along with his Alice in Chains bandmates, the band&#x27;s manager Susan Silver and her then-husband Chris Cornell, as well as other music personalities. Chris Cornell, joined by Heart&#x27;s Ann and Nancy Wilson, sang a rendition of The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Wild Horses&quot; at the funeral. They also performed The Lovemongers&#x27; song &quot;Sand&quot;.

Jerry Cantrell dedicated his solo album, &quot;Degradation Trip&quot;, released two months after Staley&#x27;s death, to his memory. Cantrell also took in Staley&#x27;s cat, Sadie, who he and the family took care of until Sadie&#x27;s death in 2010, at the age of 18.

Shortly after Staley&#x27;s death, his parents Nancy McCallum and Phil Staley started receiving donations from fans all over the world. Nancy and Phil worked with Seattle&#x27;s Therapeutic Health Services clinic to create the Layne Staley Memorial Fund to help other heroin addicts and their families in the Seattle music community.

Alice in Chains remained inactive following Staley&#x27;s death. For the next several years, the band refused to perform together, out of respect for him. In 2005, Cantrell, Kinney, and Inez reunited for a benefit concert for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, with several vocalists filling in for Staley. Following positive response, the band decided to reunite formally in 2006. Comes with the Fall vocalist William DuVall, a member of Cantrell&#x27;s solo touring band who often sang Staley&#x27;s parts on the Alice in Chains songs that Cantrell performed, was announced to sing Staley&#x27;s part for the reunion shows. In an interview with MTV News, Kinney noted that the band would use the reunion concerts to pay tribute to the songs and to Staley. The band used to have an intermission to include a five-minute filmed tribute to Staley in between sets. DuVall has since become Staley&#x27;s full-time replacement in the band, contributing to three full-length releases.

==Tributes and influence==
Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins stated that Staley &quot;had an amazing voice that had such a beautiful, sad, haunting quality about it. He was different because his heaviness was in that voice.&quot; The song &quot;Bleeding The Orchid&quot; from The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; 2007 album &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; was indirectly inspired by the death of Staley.

Cold&#x27;s song &quot;The Day Seattle Died&quot; from their 2003 album &quot;Year of the Spider&quot; was an ode to Staley, as well as fellow grunge figurehead Kurt Cobain. That same year Staind featured a song called &quot;Layne&quot; in memory to the singer on their album &quot;14 Shades of Grey&quot;. In their 2004 album Hangover Music Vol. VI, Black Label Society also included a tribute to Staley, titled &quot;Layne&quot;. Kat Bjelland, formerly of Babes in Toyland, wrote the song “Layne to Rest” about him on her band Katastrophy Wife’s 2004 album &quot;All Kneel&quot;.

Eddie Vedder, lead singer of Pearl Jam, wrote a song eulogizing Staley, titled &quot;4/20/02&quot; (the day Vedder heard the news). The song featured only Vedder singing and playing the guitar in a ukulele-inspired tuning, and was released as a hidden track on Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2003 B-sides and rarities album, &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;, roughly four minutes and twenty seconds after the conclusion of the final listed song, &quot;Bee Girl&quot;. Vedder also paid tribute to Staley during a Pearl Jam concert in Chicago on August 22, 2016, which would have been Staley&#x27;s 49th birthday, and dedicated the song &quot;Man of the Hour&quot; to his late friend.

Jerry Cantrell said Staley gave him the self-assurance to sing. &quot;Layne was really responsible for giving me the confidence to become more of a singer. He&#x27;d say, &#x27;You wrote this song, this means something to you, sing it.&#x27; He kicked my ass out of the nest. Over the years I continued to grow, and Layne started to play guitar, and we inspired each other&quot;.

Since 2002, Seattle has hosted an annual tribute concert for Staley on his birthday. Venues such as the Moore Theatre, The Showbox The Fenix, and The Crocodile have hosted the event. The show proceeds benefit the Layne Staley Memorial Fund.

Staley ranked at No. 27 on &quot;Hit Parader&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;Heavy Metal&#x27;s All-Time Top 100 Vocalists&quot; published in the November 2006 issue, and at No. 42 on Complex&#x27;s magazine list of &quot;The 50 Best Lead Singers of All Time&quot; in 2012.

Staley was an inspiration for the title of Metallica&#x27;s 2008 album, &quot;Death Magnetic&quot;. The band recorded a song in tribute to him, titled &quot;Rebel of Babylon&quot;.

In 2009, Alice in Chains released their first studio album in 14 years, &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot;, with Cantrell and then-new vocalist and rhythm guitarist William DuVall sharing lead vocals. The title track is a tribute to Staley. Cantrell invited Elton John to join Alice in Chains and pay tribute to Staley playing the piano in &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot;, the closing song in the album. The song was written and sung by Cantrell, who described it as the band&#x27;s goodbye to Staley. The first concert that Staley attended was Elton John&#x27;s and he was blown away by it. According to Cantrell, the album&#x27;s cover art featuring a heart surrounded by a black background was inspired by the heartbreak of Staley&#x27;s death. Staley&#x27;s former bandmates also thanked him in the album&#x27;s liner notes.

On September 6, 2011, Hank Williams III released his &quot;Attention Deficit Domination&quot; album and dedicated it to Staley.

Staley&#x27;s Alice in Chains bandmates have stated that one of the saddest aspects of his legacy is to hear him remembered primarily for his drug use rather than the other aspects of his personality. Kinney and Cantrell have also expressed their frustration over the Grammys ignoring Staley during their annual tribute to the musicians who have died in the past year.

In 2013, Alice in Chains&#x27; drummer, Sean Kinney, added the initials &quot;LSMS&quot; on his drum kit, a tribute to Staley and the band&#x27;s former bassist, Mike Starr, who died in 2011. The music video for Alice in Chains&#x27; 2013 single, &quot;Voices&quot;, features a picture of Staley next to a photo of Nirvana&#x27;s frontman, Kurt Cobain, at the 2:20 mark.

Since Alice in Chains reunited, Jerry Cantrell started paying tribute to Staley before performing the song &quot;Nutshell&quot;. Since 2011, Cantrell pays tribute to both Staley and Mike Starr before performing the song at concerts.

In April 2017, Nancy Wilson revealed that she started writing the song &quot;The Dragon&quot; for Staley in the &#x27;90s. The song was recorded in 2016 and is part of the EP of Wilson&#x27;s new band, Roadcase Royale, released in 2017.

On what would&#x27;ve been Staley&#x27;s 50th birthday, August 22, 2017, Alice in Chains released a video paying tribute to him, featuring Jerry Cantrell, Ann Wilson, Mike McCready, and Barrett Martin.

William DuVall revealed that he was thinking about Staley, his grandmother and the Soundgarden lead vocalist Chris Cornell while writing the Alice in Chains&#x27; song &quot;Never Fade&quot;, from their 2018 album, &quot;Rainier Fog&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track, written by Cantrell, is partly a tribute to Staley and Mike Starr.

===Layne Staley Day in Seattle===
On August 22, 2019, which would have been Staley&#x27;s 52nd birthday, Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan officially proclaimed that day as &quot;Layne Staley Day&quot; in the city in honor of Staley&#x27;s contributions to the world of music. The day was also a call to attention to the Layne Staley Memorial Fund, established by his parents in 2002.

===Books===
Two biographies have been written about Staley, both authored by Adriana Rubio—&quot;Layne Staley: Angry Chair&quot; released in 2003, which contains an alleged final interview of Staley that Rubio claimed to have conducted less than three months before his death, and &quot;Layne Staley: Get Born Again&quot;, released in 2009, a revised and updated version of her earlier book.

Staley&#x27;s family has disputed Rubio&#x27;s work, stating they do not believe she interviewed him in 2002. When questioned about the authenticity of the book, Rubio refused to confirm the interview was genuine. Staley&#x27;s last interview was for the radio program Rockline on July 19, 1999, promoting the release of the compilation album &quot;Nothing Safe: Best of the Box&quot; with the other members of Alice in Chains. The content of Rubio&#x27;s book, including what she referred to as Staley&#x27;s final interview, was called into question in journalist David De Sola&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;Alice in Chains: The Untold Story&quot;. De Sola questions not only the content of the interview, which portrays Staley as using his lyrics in casual conversation, it also indicates that Rubio never spoke to him, citing her refusal to release the tape with the interview and the fact that not even her publisher had access to the tape. One of Staley&#x27;s sisters, Liz Coats, likewise doubted the veracity of the book.

Staley was featured on the books &quot;Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music&quot; (2009) by Greg Prato, and &quot;Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge&quot; (2011) by Mark Yarm. Both books explored the history of grunge in detail and touch upon Alice in Chains and Staley&#x27;s life and death via interviews with Staley&#x27;s mother, friends and bandmates, including Cantrell, Kinney, Starr and Inez.

In August 2015, journalist David de Sola released the biography &quot;Alice in Chains: The Untold Story&quot;, which is mainly focused on Staley and features interviews with his friends and relatives; the surviving members of Alice in Chains did not partake in interviews for this book.

==Discography==
===Alice in Chains===
Staley appeared on all Alice in Chains releases from &quot;We Die Young&quot; up to the song &quot;Died&quot;, later taking part in reissues and compilations containing material from his time in the band.

<text>Laguna , officially the Province of Laguna (), is a province in the Philippines located in the Calabarzon region in Luzon. Its capital is Santa Cruz while its largest city is the City of Calamba (the regional center of Calabarzon) and the province is situated southeast of Metro Manila, south of the province of Rizal, west of Quezon, north of Batangas and east of Cavite. Laguna hugs the southern shores of Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the country. As of the 2020 census, the total population of Laguna is 3,382,193. Among all 82 provinces in the Philippines, Laguna accounted for the largest share (5%) of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with a total of Php 990.69 billion in 2022.

Laguna is notable as the birthplace of José Rizal, the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; national hero. It has numerous natural and cultural attractions such as Cavinti Falls aka Pagsanjan Falls, the University of the Philippines Los Baños and the University of the Philippines Open University in Los Baños, the hot spring resorts of Calamba on the slopes of Mount Makiling, Pila historic town plaza, Taytay Falls in Majayjay, the wood carvings and &quot;papier-mâché&quot; created by the people of Paete, the annual &quot;Sampaguita Festival&quot; in San Pedro, the &quot;turumba&quot; of Pakil, the &quot;tsinelas&quot; footwear from Liliw, the &quot;Pandan Festival&quot; of Luisiana, the &quot;Pinya Festival&quot; of Calauan, the Seven Lakes of San Pablo, and the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery in Nagcarlan.

Laguna is part of the Greater Manila Area alongside Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan.

== History ==

===Early history===
Pre-Hispanic settlement in the area can be dated to prehistoric times, as evidenced in the names of towns such as Pila, Laguna, whose name can be traced to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of the rice paddy, or &quot;Pilapil&quot;. The written history of the province of Laguna, (Lagoon in Spanish) and that of the Southern Tagalog region, dates to 900 AD. The Laguna Copperplate Inscription is the oldest known written document found in the Philippines. It notes that its subject was released from a debt to the King of Tondo.

A prominent figure during the time of pre-Hispanic contact is Gat Pangil, a powerful native ruler in the area. The towns of Bay, Pangil and Pakil were reputed to have once been a part of his domain, although accounts vary about his identity.

===Spanish colonial period===

The province of Laguna, which was formerly called &quot;La Laguna&quot; and &quot;La Provincia de la Laguna de Bay&quot;, was named after Laguna de Bay, the body of water that forms its northern boundary. Laguna de Bay, in turn, was named after the town of Bay, the first provincial capital. Captain Juan de Salcedo with a band of one hundred Spanish-Mexican soldiers conquered the province and its surrounding regions for Spain in 1571. The province of La Laguna comprised the modern province of Laguna, as well as parts of what are now known as Rizal and Quezon provinces.

In 1577, Spanish Franciscan missionaries arrived in Manila, and in 1578 they started evangelizing Laguna, Morong (now Rizal), Tayabas (now Quezon) and the Bicol Peninsula as part of the colonizing effort. Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa were the earliest Franciscans sent to these places. From 1580, the towns of Bay, Caliraya, Majayjay, Nagcarlan, Liliw, Pila, Santa Cruz, Lumban, Pangil and Siniloan were founded. During the time of Governor-General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, the province of La Laguna was divided into the following encomiendas:
*Maribago – Currently the area of Balibago in Santa Rosa
*Tabuco – Currently the areas surrounding San Pedro, Biñan, Santa Rosa, Cabuyao, and Calamba
*Taitay – Currently Taytay, Rizal
*Bay – The area surrounding Bay, Laguna, and Los Baños, Laguna
*Pila – The area that is now Pila, Victoria, Pililla, and Jalajala, Rizal
*Mahaihai – Currently the area around Majayjay, Magdalena, and Luisiana
*Lumbang – The largest encomienda, containing what is now known as Lumban, Santa Cruz, Paete, Pakil, Cavinti, and Pagsanjan
*Tayaval – Tayabas, now known as Quezon province
*Panguil – Now Pangil
*Sinaloa – The area surrounding Siniloan, Famy and Mabitac
*Morong – Currently the areas surrounding Morong, including the town of Santa Maria, formerly known as Caboan
*Nayun – Nayum, currently Tiaong, Quezon

By 1591, there were approximately 48,400 people living in the province.

Laguna was the site of multiple engagements during the Sangley Rebellion, made up of Chinese-Filipino mestizos. In 1603, Antonio de Morga relates how the Chinese rebels scattered to three divisions, one of which went to the mountains of San Pablo. Captain Don Luys de Velasco, aided by Spanish and Filipino forces, was successful in pursuing the rebels. Eventually the Chinese were able to kill Luys de Velasco and ten of his men, before securing themselves in San Pablo while waiting for reinforcement from the mainland. On October 20, 1603, Governor-General Pedro Bravo de Acuña then sent Captain Cristoval de Axqueta Menchaca to pursue and crush the rebellion and was successful after twenty days of fighting.

Around this time the hot springs of Los Baños and San Pablo were known to the Spanish, and a hospital was built in the area. By 1622, the hospital was notable enough to be mentioned by the Archbishop of Manila at the time, Miguel García Serrano in his letter to King Philip IV.

In 1639, a second rebellion involving the Chinese occurred, and the rebels fortified themselves in the highlands of Cavinti and Lumban before surrendering in Pagsanjan a year later.

In 1670, a delimitation of borders were made between Lucban, Majayjay and Cavite. The most populous town at that time, Bay, was capital of the province until 1688, when the seat of the provincial government was moved to Pagsanján. Pagsanján would be the provincial seat until 1858 when it was moved once again to Santa Cruz. In 1754, the province of Laguna and Tayabas were divided, with the Malinao River separating the towns of Majayjay and Lucban.

In 1678, Fray Hernando Cabrera founded San Pablo de los Montes (now San Pablo City) and built a wooden church and convent considered as the best and finest in the province.

Fighting extended to Laguna during the British occupation of Manila between the years of 1762–64. A detachment of British troops under Captain Thomas Backhouse entered the province in search of the silver cargo of the galleon &quot;Filipina&quot; while Francisco de San Juan led a band of volunteers that fought them in several engagements in and around the then provincial capital of Pagsanjan. Backhouse plundered the town and burned its newly reconstructed church but San Juan succeeded in escaping with the precious hoard to Pampanga where the treasure greatly bolstered the defense effort of Governor-General Simón de Anda y Salazar. For his actions, San Juan was made a brigade commander and &quot;alcalde mayor&quot; of Tayabas (now Quezon) province.

In 1774, authorities from Bulacan, Tondo, Laguna Bay, and other areas surrounding Manila reported with consternation that discharged soldiers and deserters (from Mexico, Spain and Peru) were providing Indios military training for the weapons that had been disseminated all over the territory during the British war. 

By the end of the 1700s, Laguna was a major province of 14,392 native families and 336 Spanish Filipino families. There were also 2,000 Chinese-Filipino farmers/families.

A major event in Laguna occurred in 1840, when religious intolerance led the people of Majayjay, Nagcarlan, Bay, and Biñan to join the revolt of Hermano Pule (Apolinario de la Cruz) of Lucban, Tayabas. This revolt was eventually crushed by Governor-General Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri.

As part of political restructuring during the 19th century, the municipalities of Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Binangonan, Jalajala, Angono and Cardona were separated from Laguna and re-organized to the province Politico-Militar Distrito de Morong. In 1858, the provincial capital was once again moved from Pagsanjan to Santa Cruz, where it stands until today.

In 1861, José Rizal was born in Calamba to Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. Rizal would become one of the leading members of the Propaganda Movement, who advocated political reforms for the colony. Rizal would go on to write two novels, &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; and &quot;El filibusterismo&quot;, which in part fueled additional anti-colonial sentiment, contributing to the eventual Philippine Revolution. In 1896, thousands of inhabitants, especially of Bay, Los Baños, Nagcarlan, Magdalena, Santa Cruz, and Pagsanjan had joined the revolutionary Katipunan. Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion. Today, Rizal is recognized as a national hero of the Philippines.

===Philippine Revolution===
Laguna was one of the eight provinces to rise in revolt against the Spanish misrule led by Generals Paciano Rizal in Calamba, Severino Taiño in Pagsanjan, Agueda Kahabagan in Calauan, and Miguel Malvar in Batangas. Emilio Jacinto, known as the &quot;brains of the Katipunan&quot;, also led forces in the province at the time.

One of the early engagements of the revolution was the Battle of Sambat, in Pagsanjan. Katipuneros from Laguna, led by Severino Taiño, took the city of Pagsanjan and attempted to use it as a starting point towards the liberation of the province, but was quelled by forces led by Basilio Augustín.

The defeat in Sambat meant the end of large-scale organized revolt in Laguna, the &quot;Malungingnging&quot; chapter of the Katipunan failing to replicate the relative success of the revolution in Cavite. The revolutionaries resorted to hit-and-run and guerrilla tactics against the Spanish, lasting until the Pact of Biak-na-Bato on December 14 to 15, 1897. 

Some revolutionaries continued the armed struggle after the Pact of Biak-na-Bato in refusal of Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s orders. Jacinto led a battle against Spanish troops in Magdalena in February 1898, but had to retreat after being shot in the hip. Jacinto would take refuge at the nearby church but was then arrested and jailed in Santa Cruz. Jacinto would escape by pretending to be a double agent for the Spanish, but would eventually contract malaria and die in April 1899. Pio del Pilar and Paciano Rizal led revolutionary troops to victory in the Battle of Calamba in May 1898, and the surrender of the last Spanish garrison in Laguna in Santa Cruz, on August 31 of the same year.

Laguna actively supported the First Philippine Republic proclaimed at Malolos on January 23, 1899. Its two delegates to the Malolos Congress were Don Higino Benítez and Don Graciano Cordero, both natives of Pagsanján.

===American colonial period===
On the outbreak of the Philippine–American War, Generals Juan Cailles and Paciano Rizal led the defense of Laguna during the war&#x27;s early stages. The Battle of Mabitac was fought in defense of the town of Mabitac and was won by Filipino forces. However, forces led by Henry W. Lawton fought and won in Santa Cruz, Pagsanjan, and Paete, effectively securing the province for American forces.

By the end of the war, the entire country was occupied by American forces and was taken as a colony. The Taft Commission was established to govern the Philippines during the interim period, which appointed Juan Cailles as the provincial governor of Laguna. Act No. 83, or the Provincial Government Act, established a civilian government under American occupation. During this time, roads were built, schools were established, and in 1917, the Manila Railroad Company extended its line to Laguna as far as Pagsanjan.

In 1903, the town of Muntinlupa became part of La Laguna and was annexed to the town of Biñan, but was later returned to the province of Rizal in 1905.

The International Rice Research Institute was established in 1960, during the presidency of Carlos P. Garcia, and a site in Los Baños was selected to be its headquarters. By 1962 during the presidency of Diosdado Macapagal, IRRI had begun research to develop the new high yield &quot;Miracle Rice&quot; (IR8) variety. Enhanced by the extensive use of chemical fertilizers, IR8 would serve as the foundation for the brief success of the Philippine Government&#x27;s Masagana 99 agricultural program during the 1970s, although the program would fail in the 1980s mostly because of the Marcos administration&#x27;s credit scheme did not work.

The social unrest which arose when Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; debt-driven campaign spending led to the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis spread beyond the capital and also triggered protests by students in Laguna, especially UP Los Baños. When martial law was declared in September 1972, Marcos cracked down on any form of criticism or activism, leading to the arrest of many of Laguna citizens. Among those who experienced arrest and torture during martial law were Dr. Aloysius Baes, while among those who became desaparecidos were Tish Ladlad, Cristina Catalla, Gerardo &quot;Gerry&quot; Faustino, Rizalina Ilagan, Ramon Jasul, Professor Jessica Sales, and Philippine Council for Agricultural Research and Resource Development artist-illustrator Manuel Ontong. Among those confirmed to have been martyred for their beliefs were Modesto &quot;Bong&quot; Sison, and Manuel Bautista. Camp Vicente Lim in the Canlubang district of Calamba was among the many sites where prisons were put up to contain detainees who dared to criticize the Marcos administration.

Laguna has been the victim of perennial flooding along the south and eastern coasts of Laguna de Bay due to the 1977 cancellation of the Parañaque spillway project. The spillway had been the second part of a plan to reduce flooding on the lakeshore towns of Metro Manila in the 1970s, but the various economic crises of the 1970s led to a lack of budget, which meant that only the Manggahan Floodway in Rizal province was built. The Floodway drew waters away from the Metro Manila lakeshore towns, but dumped them on to the lake. The cancellation of the Parañaque spillway meant that there was no way for the water levels of the lake to be reduced in turn. Within the first year of Manggahan Floodway&#x27;s completion in 1986, Laguna was hit by an unusual large flood which lasted for 2 months and resulted in high mortality and morbidity rates due to gastroenteritis and other water-borne diseases.

<text>Giovanni Battista Tiepolo ( , ; 5 March 1696 – 27 March 1770), also known as Giambattista (or Gianbattista) Tiepolo, was an Italian painter and printmaker from the Republic of Venice who painted in the Rococo style, considered an important member of the 18th-century Venetian school. He was prolific, and worked not only in Italy, but also in Germany and Spain.

Giovan Battista Tiepolo, together with Giambattista Pittoni, Canaletto, Giovan Battista Piazzetta, Giuseppe Maria Crespi, and Francesco Guardi are considered the traditional Old Masters of that period.

Successful from the beginning of his career, he has been described by Michael Levey as &quot;the greatest decorative painter of eighteenth-century Europe, as well as its most able craftsman.&quot;

==Biography==


===Early life (1696–1726)===
Born in Venice, he was the youngest of six children of Domenico and Orsetta Tiepolo. His father was a small shipping merchant who belonged to a family that bore the prestigious patrician name of Tiepolo without claiming any noble descent. Some of the children acquired noble godparents, and Giambattista was originally named after his godfather, a Venetian nobleman called Giovanni Battista Dorià. He was baptised on 16 April 1696 in the local church, San Pietro di Castello (then still officially the cathedral of Venice). His father died about a year later, leaving his mother to bring up a family of young children, presumably in somewhat difficult circumstances.

In 1710, he became a pupil of Gregorio Lazzarini, a successful painter with an eclectic style. He was, though, at least equally strongly influenced by his study of the works of other contemporary artists such as Sebastiano Ricci, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta and Federico Bencovich, as well those of his Venetian predecessors, especially Tintoretto and Veronese. A biography of his teacher, published in 1732, says that Tiepolo &quot;departed from [Lazzarini&#x27;s] studied manner of painting, and, all spirit and fire, embraced a quick and resolute style&quot;. His earliest known works are depictions of the apostles, painted in spandrels as part of the decoration of Santa Maria dei Derelitti in Venice in 1715–6. At about the same time he became painter to the Doge, Giovanni II Cornaro, and oversaw the hanging of pictures at his palace, as well as painting many works himself, of which only two portraits have been identified. He painted his first fresco in 1716, on the ceiling of a church at Biadene, near Treviso. He probably left Lazzarini&#x27;s studio in 1717, the year he was received into the Fraglia or guild of painters.

In around 1719–20, he painted a scheme of frescoes for the wealthy and recently ennobled publisher Giambattista Baglione in the hall of his villa at Massanzago near Padua. Tiepolo depicted the &quot;Triumph of Aurora&quot; on the ceiling, and the &quot;Myth of Phaethon&quot; on the walls, creating the kind of fluid spatial illusion which was to become a recurring theme in his work.

In 1722 he was one of twelve artists commissioned to contribute a painting on canvas of one of the apostles as part of a decorative scheme for the nave of San Stae in Venice. The other artists involved included Ricci, Piazetta, and Pellegrini.

===Marriage and children===
In 1719, Tiepolo married noblewoman Maria Cecilia Guardi, sister of two contemporary Venetian painters, Francesco and Giovanni Antonio Guardi. Tiepolo and his wife had nine children, of whom four daughters and three sons survived to adulthood. Two of his sons, Giovanni Domenico and Lorenzo, painted with him as his assistants and later achieved some independent recognition, in particular Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo. His children painted figures with a design similar to that of their father, but with distinctive, including genre, styles. His third son became a priest. Fabio Canal, Francesco Lorenzi, and Domenico Pasquini were among his pupils.

===Early mature work (1726–1750)===
Some major commissions came from the patrician Dolfin family. Dionisio Dolfin, the Archbishop of Udine in Friuli employed him to decorate a chapel in Udine Cathedral, and then to paint another cycle depicting episodes from the lives of Abraham and his descendants from the Book of Genesis at his archiepiscopal palace (the &quot;Arcivescovado&quot;)
(completed 1726–1728). Despite their elevated subject matter, they are bright in colour, and light-hearted in mood: Michael Levey describes the paintings at the palace as &quot;a shimmering set of tableaux, full of wit and elegance&quot;. Tiepolo used a much cooler palette than previous Venetian painters, in order to create a convincing effect of daylight. His first masterpieces in Venice were a cycle of ten enormous canvases painted to decorate a large reception room of Ca&#x27; Dolfin on the Grand Canal of Venice (ca. 1726–1729), depicting battles and triumphs from the history of ancient Rome.

These early masterpieces, innovative amongst Venetian frescoes for their luminosity, brought him many commissions. He painted canvases for churches such as that of Verolanuova (1735–1740), for the Scuola Grande dei Carmini (1740–1747), in Cannaregio, a ceiling for the Palazzi Archinto and Palazzo Dugnani in Milan (1731), the Colleoni Chapel in Bergamo (1732–1733), a ceiling for the Gesuati (Santa Maria del Rosario) in Venice of &quot;St. Dominic Instituting the Rosary&quot; (1737–1739), Palazzo Clerici, Milan (1740), decorations for Villa Cordellina Molin, a ceiling for the Chiesa degli Scalzi (1743–1744); now destroyed (reconstitution :), Villa Cordellina Molin, Montecchio Maggiore (1743–1744) and for the ballroom of the Palazzo Labia in Venice (now a television studio), showing the &quot;Story of Cleopatra&quot; (1745–1750).

===Etchings===
Tiepolo produced two sets of etchings, the &quot;Capricci&quot; (c. 1740–1742) and the &quot;Scherzi di fantasia&quot; (c. 1743–1757). The ten &quot;capricci&quot; were first published by Anton Maria Zanetti, incorporated into the third edition of a compilation of woodcuts after Parmigianino. They were not published separately until 1785. The subject matter is often bizarre and fantastical, and the works owe a lot to the example of Salvator Rosa and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione. The 23 Scherzi were etched over more than ten years and privately circulated, only being commercially published after Tiepolo&#x27;s death, with numbers and titles added by his son, Giandomenico. Subjects include mysterious Eastern figures, and, in some of the later prints, scenes of necromancy.

===Würzburg Residenz (1750–1753)===

By 1750, Tiepolo&#x27;s reputation was firmly established throughout Europe, with the help of his friend Francesco Algarotti, an art dealer, critic and collector. That year, at the behest of Prince-Bishop Karl Philipp von Greifenclau zu Vollraths, he traveled to Würzburg where he arrived in November 1750. He remained there for three years during which he executed ceiling paintings in the New Residenz palace (completed 1744). He frescoed the Kaisersaal salon in collaboration with his sons Giandomenico and Lorenzo and was then invited to deliver a design for the grandiose entrance staircase (&quot;Treppenhaus&quot;) designed by Balthasar Neumann. It is a massive ceiling fresco at , and was completed in November 1753. His &quot;Allegory of the Planets and Continents&quot; depicts Apollo embarking on his daily course; deities around him symbolize the planets; allegorical figures (on the cornice) represent the four continents. He included several portraits in the Europe section of this fresco, including a self-portrait; one of his son Giandomenico; one of the prince-bishop von Greiffenklau; one of the painter Antonio Bossi; and one of the architect, Balthasar Neumann.

===Return to Venice and the Veneto (1753–1770)===

Tiepolo returned to Venice in 1753. He was now in demand locally, as well as abroad where he was elected President of the Academy of Padua. He went on to complete theatrical frescoes for churches; the &quot;Triumph of Faith&quot; for the Chiesa della Pietà; panel frescos for Ca&#x27; Rezzonico (which now also houses his ceiling fresco from the Palazzo Barbarigo); and paintings for patrician villas in the Venetian countryside, such as Villa Valmarana in Vicenza and an elaborate panegyric ceiling for the Villa Pisani in Stra.

In some celebrated frescoes at the Palazzo Labia, he depicted two scenes from the life of Cleopatra: &quot;Meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Banquet of Cleopatra&quot;, as well as, in a central ceiling fresco, the &quot;Triumph of Bellerophon over Time&quot;. Here he collaborated with Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna. This connection with Colonna, who also designed sets for opera, highlights the increasing tendency towards composition as a staged fiction in Tiepolo&#x27;s frescoes. The architecture of the &quot;Banquet&quot; fresco also recalls that of Veronese&#x27;s &quot;Wedding at Cana&quot;. In 1757, he painted an altar piece for the Thiene family, representing the apotheosis of Saint Cajetan. It is in the church of hamlet of Rampazzo in the Camisano Vicentino.

===Madrid===
In 1761, King Charles III of Spain commissioned Tiepolo to create a ceiling fresco to decorate the throne room of the Royal Palace of Madrid. The panegyric theme is the &quot;Apotheosis of Spain&quot; and has allegorical depictions recalling the dominance of Spain in the Americas and across the globe.

He also painted two other ceilings in the palace, and carried out many private commissions in Spain. However, he suffered from the jealousy and the bitter opposition of the rising champion of Neoclassicism, Anton Raphael Mengs; at the instigation of Mengs&#x27; supporter, the King&#x27;s confessor Joaquim de Electa, had Tiepolo&#x27;s series of canvases for the church of San Pascual at Aranjuez replaced by works by his favourite.

Tiepolo died in Madrid on 27 March 1770. He is buried in Madonna dell&#x27;Orto in Venice

After his death, the rise of a stern Neoclassicism and the post-revolutionary decline of absolutism led to the slow decline of the Rococo style associated with his name, but failed to dent his reputation. In 1772, Tiepolo&#x27;s son was sufficiently respected to be painter to Doge Giovanni II Cornaro, in charge of the decoration of Palazzo Mocenigo in the &quot;sestiere&quot; of San Polo, Venice.

<text>A glycome is the entire complement or complete set of all sugars, whether free or chemically bound in more complex molecules, of an organism. An alternative definition is the entirety of carbohydrates in a cell. The glycome may in fact be one of the most complex entities in nature. &quot;Glycomics, analogous to genomics and proteomics, is the systematic study of all glycan structures of a given cell type or organism&quot; and is a subset of glycobiology.

&quot;Carbohydrate&quot;, &quot;glycan&quot;, &quot;saccharide&quot;, and &quot;sugar&quot; are generic terms used interchangeably in this context and includes monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and derivatives of these compounds. Carbohydrates consist of &quot;hydrated carbon&quot;, i.e. [CH2O]n. Monosaccharides are a carbohydrate that cannot be hydrolyzed into a simpler carbohydrate and are the building blocks of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Oligosaccharides are linear or branched chains of monosaccharides attached to one another via glycosidic linkages. The number of monosaccharide units can vary. Polysaccharides are glycans composed of repeating monosaccharides, generally greater than ten monosaccharide units in length.

The glycome exceeds the complexity of the proteome as a result of the even greater diversity of the glycome&#x27;s constituent carbohydrates and is further complicated by the sheer multiplicity of possibilities in the combination and interaction of the carbohydrates with each other and with proteins. &quot;The spectrum of all glycan structures — the glycome — is immense. In humans, its size is orders of magnitude greater than the number of proteins that are encoded by the genome, one percent of which encodes proteins that make, modify, localize or bind sugar chains, which are known as glycans.&quot;

The outer surface of the cell is a sea of lipids with a fleet of sugar molecules, many of which are attached to proteins, fats or both, that interact with molecules outside the cell and are critical for the communication between cells and the stickiness of a cell. &quot;Glycans are nature&#x27;s biologic modifiers,&quot; says Jamey Marth, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of California San Diego.&quot;Glycans generally don&#x27;t turn physiologic processes on and off, rather they modify the behavior of the cell by responding to external stimuli.&quot;

==Tools used for research on glycome==
The following are examples of the commonly used techniques in glycan analysis:

===High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)===
The most commonly applied methods are MS and HPLC, in which the glycan part is cleaved either enzymatically or chemically from the target and subjected to analysis. In case of glycolipids, they can be analyzed directly without separation of the lipid component.

N-glycans from glycoproteins are analyzed routinely by high-performance-liquid-chromatography (reversed phase, normal phase and ion exchange HPLC) after tagging the reducing end of the sugars with a fluorescent compound (reductive labeling).
A large variety of different labels were introduced in the recent years, where 2-aminobenzamide (AB), anthranilic acid (AA), 2-aminopyridin (PA), 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) and 3-(acetylamino)-6-aminoacridine (AA-Ac) are just a few of them.

O-glycans are usually analysed without any tags, due to the chemical release conditions preventing them to be labeled.

Fractionated glycans from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instruments can be further analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS(MS) to get further information about structure and purity. Sometimes glycan pools are analyzed directly by mass spectrometry without prefractionation, although a discrimination between isobaric glycan structures is more challenging or even not always possible. Anyway, direct MALDI-TOF-MS analysis can lead to a fast and straightforward illustration of the glycan pool.

In recent years, high performance liquid chromatography online coupled to mass spectrometry became very popular. By choosing porous graphitic carbon as a stationary phase for liquid chromatography, even non derivatized glycans can be analyzed. Detection is here done by mass spectrometry, but in instead of MALDI-MS, electrospray ionisation (ESI) is more frequently used.

===Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)===
Although MRM has been used extensively in metabolomics and proteomics, its high sensitivity and linear response over a wide dynamic range make it especially suited for glycan biomarker research and discovery. MRM is performed on a triple quadrupole (QqQ) instrument, which is set to detect a predetermined precursor ion in the first quadrupole, a fragmented in the collision quadrupole, and a predetermined fragment ion in the third quadrupole. It is a non-scanning technique, wherein each transition is detected individually and the detection of multiple transitions occurs concurrently in duty cycles. This technique is being used to characterize the immune glycome.

===Arrays===
Lectin and antibody arrays provide high-throughput screening of many samples containing glycans. This method uses either naturally occurring lectins or artificial monoclonal antibodies, where both are immobilized on a certain chip and incubated with a fluorescent glycoprotein sample.

Glycan arrays, like that offered by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics and Z Biotech LLC, contain carbohydrate compounds that can be screened with lectins or antibodies to define carbohydrate specificity and identify ligands.

===Metabolic and covalent labeling of glycans===
Metabolic labeling of glycans can be used as a way to detect glycan structures. A well known strategy involves the use of azide-labeled sugars which can be reacted using the Staudinger ligation. This method has been used for in vitro and in vivo imaging of glycans.

===Tools for glycoproteins===
X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for complete structural analysis of complex glycans is a difficult and complex field. However, the structure of the binding site of numerous lectins, enzymes and other carbohydrate-binding proteins has revealed a wide variety of the structural basis for glycome function. The purity of test samples have been obtained through chromatography (affinity chromatography etc.) and analytical electrophoresis (PAGE (polyacrylamide electrophoresis), capillary electrophoresis, affinity electrophoresis, etc.).

<doc id="216784" wikidata="Q867120" url="?curid=216784" title="Church Stretton">
<text>Church Stretton is a market town and civil parish in Shropshire, England, south of Shrewsbury and north of Ludlow. The population in 2011 was 4,671.

The town was nicknamed Little Switzerland in the late Victorian and Edwardian period for its landscape, and became a health resort. The local geology includes some of the oldest rocks in England and a notable fault is named after the town.

Church Stretton is in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==History==

People have lived in the Stretton Gap (or Dale) for thousands of years; an Iron Age hillfort on Caer Caradoc overlooks the town. The name &quot;Stretton&quot; is derived from the Old English words &quot;stræt&quot; meaning &quot;Roman road&quot; and &quot;tun&quot; meaning &quot;settlement&quot;; a Roman road, Watling Street runs through the Stretton Gap, though the town (and adjacent settlements) were not historically located on this road – during the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; the settlements grew a short distance away from the old thoroughfare, for defensive purposes. Today the modern A49 road, which was constructed on its current alignment through the Stretton Gap in the late 1930s, runs along a similar course to the Roman Road. The Roman road was historically known as Botte Street.

The settlements of Little Stretton, Church Stretton and All Stretton (until the late 19th century regarded as separate townships) formed the manor of Stretton or Stretton-en-le-Dale. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded 35 households and a mill in the manor. Church Stretton became the largest of the settlements, with the manor&#x27;s parish church and market located there, and being where Bristol Road had a junction with the road to Much Wenlock and the Burway – a route over the Long Mynd. At the time of the Domesday Book, the manor came under the hundred of Culvestan, a Saxon hundred that was amalgamated during the reign of Henry I — the Strettons then came within the upper division of the hundred of Munslow.

The town was first granted a market charter by King John in 1214, for a weekly market on Wednesdays, but by 1253 the market day had changed to Tuesdays. In 1337 a new charter was granted by Edward III and it authorised a weekly market to be held on Thursdays. The market is still held every Thursday, in the square on the High Street, which has been the town&#x27;s market place since the 13th century. Much of the town was destroyed by fire in 1593 and many of the present half timbered buildings in the town centre date from the time of the rebuilding.

The High Street was for many centuries known instead as the Bristol Road, being the road from Shrewsbury to Bristol. It was once a much wider street within the town, with the churchyard of St Laurence bordering directly onto the street. Over time buildings were erected on the street, in a similar fashion to other English market towns, such as in Ludlow. The High Street, which is a narrow street, is effectively only the eastern side of the original Bristol Road thoroughfare through the town. It was made more open when the old market hall was demolished to form the present town square.

===18th century===
====Carding Mill Valley====

Historically the town was known for its textiles, using the abundant local wool, and a notable location for this industry was Carding Mill Valley (). The carding mill there was built in the eighteenth century, and named after a stage in making cloth, the three stages being carding, spinning and weaving. Carding would have been done by children, and involved using a hand-card that removed and untangled short fibres from the mass of raw material. The cards were wooden blocks with handles and covered in metal spikes, which were angled (to make it easier to untangle) and set in leather. When untangled, the material would be spun, and then woven into the final product.

The carding mill closed and was demolished at the beginning of the twentieth century, though the adjacent factory building remains in the valley today. The valley it is in took the name &quot;Carding Mill Valley&quot;, and is now a tourist attraction and well-known starting location for walkers (being at the heart of the Long Mynd range). Those who follow the valley to its summit are greeted by the sight of the Lightspout waterfall. The valley is owned (along with the entire hill range) by the National Trust, who have a visitor centre there. The mill building itself has been converted into flats and a number of other private houses exist near it and the visitor centre, forming a small settlement in the valley. Vehicles (and therefore most visitors) have to drive up from the town, from Shrewsbury Road, to access the valley.

Cars may drive as far as the car park situated about a mile up the valley. This car park was at one time an open-air swimming pool. A sign indicating water depth still stands in its original position.

===Victorian and Edwardian times===

Church Stretton was nicknamed &quot;Little Switzerland&quot; in late-Victorian and Edwardian times, because of its surroundings and the way many houses hug the hillside.

Church Stretton railway station opened on 20 April 1852 as part of the newly created Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway. It was originally to the north of (what is now known as) Sandford Avenue and the old station building still remains, but is no longer in railway use. Sandford Avenue had been for centuries called Lake Lane and became Station Road with the arrival of the railway in the town, before becoming Sandford Avenue in 1884.

In 1914 the railway station was moved just to the south of the Sandford Avenue road bridge, where it continues to the present day. New railway station buildings were built, but these were demolished in 1970, the station having become unstaffed in 1967.

Local property developer Ralph Beaumont Benson (1862–1911), who lived at Lutwyche Hall in nearby Easthope, is responsible for the naming of Easthope Road, Essex Road (after his wife), Beaumont Road and Lutwyche Road, all in the centre of the town and part of the town&#x27;s expansion in the early twentieth century.

====Longmynd Hotel====
The Longmynd Hotel on Cunnery Road opened in 1901, originally as &quot;The Hydropathic Hotel&quot; (or &quot;the Hydro&quot;), at a time when the town was popular as a spa. Today it continues as a hotel and has a number of features and activities in its woodland grounds; it is also a wedding and conference venue. In 2012 it was sold by the local Chapman family (who ran it since 1977) to &#x27;HF Holidays&#x27;, a national company. It is no longer a hotel but a hostel and used exclusively by HF members.

===Mid-twentieth century===
During and just after the Second World War, from 1940 to 1946, St Dunstan&#x27;s (now Blind Veterans UK) was based in the town. The charitable service (for blinded armed forces personnel) was moved from Sussex as Church Stretton was thought to be a safe location. Some 700 people were trained during this period in Church Stretton in an industrial training centre set up at a malthouse in Sandford Avenue. The Long Mynd Hotel, the Denehurst Hotel, the Brockhurst Estate and Tiger Hall were the most notable buildings taken over by St Dunstan&#x27;s in the town. A residential cul-de-sac is named St Dunstan&#x27;s Close in recognition of the charity&#x27;s place in the town&#x27;s history. The Long Mynd was considered to be a potential landing place for German parachutists, although Church Stretton avoided the aerial bombing of the war; the only death recorded in the district by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission of a civilian war casualty was of a firewatcher from Manchester who died while being treated at the St Dunstan&#x27;s Hospital.

===Late 20th century===

A small market hall stood on the High Street but was demolished in July 1963 and the site has become a town square, and is still used to hold markets on. The first market hall – a timber-framed construction – was built in 1617; this was replaced by the second market hall (called the Town Hall) in 1839, which was a stone and red-brick construction. Today the Silvester Horne Institute (extended and refurbished in 2011) is the town&#x27;s main meeting place for societies, polling, public meetings and exhibitions. Additionally there is the Mayfair Community Centre on Easthope Road and the St Laurence&#x27;s Parish Hall on Church Street.

In recent years volunteer members of the Community Group have transformed Church Stretton into the Town of Flags: thanks to local grants they have purchased over 120 flags – English, Union and foreign – and these are regularly flown in the town centre on special occasions throughout the year.

===Conservation===
Most of the town centre and large parts of the town both to the east and to the west of the A49, including Carding Mill Valley, is covered by the Church Stretton Conservation Area. The Conservation Area contains all of the town&#x27;s listed buildings and smaller structures, approximately 40 in total. St Laurence&#x27;s Church is Grade I listed.

===Population===
At the 2011 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 4,671. The population of Church Stretton parish (including All Stretton, Little Stretton and Minton) was recorded in official UK censuses as being:






The population remained steady between 1841 and 1901, but then boomed in the first two decades of the 20th century as the town became a desirable rural retreat. Another spate of growth occurred in the period 1931–1951. Since then there has been unremarkable growth, with some expansion in the 1970s and &#x27;80s and more recently in the 2000s.

==Geography==
Church Stretton is located approximately south of Shropshire&#x27;s county town, Shrewsbury. The town is dominated by the surrounding hills, including the huge Long Mynd massif to the west, and Caer Caradoc and the adjacent hills (Hazler, Ragleth, &quot;et al.&quot;) to the east.

Church Stretton effectively lies at a saddle point – the railway station lies roughly at this position, which is at above sea level. The High Street through the town centre runs at an elevation of 636 feet. Because of its position at a saddle point, water drains away from the town in two directions – towards the north (to the Cound and then the Severn) and towards the south (to the Onny and then the Teme) – roughly Sandford Avenue in the town centre forms the watershed.

===Localities===
The historic core of the town lies around the parish church and along the High Street. With the building of the railway line and station in 1852, the town began to grow towards the new station, along what is today Sandford Avenue. Since the first half of the 20th century the two main streets of the town centre are the High Street and Sandford Avenue. In the later decades of the 20th century a number of shops on the southern end of High Street changed use to restaurants or purely residential, as Sandford Avenue became the pre-eminent shopping street. The B5477 takes the name Shrewsbury Road north from the town centre, High Street within the town centre, and Ludlow Road south of there.

Cunnery is a hillside and collection of houses to the west of the town centre and includes the Long Mynd Hotel. World&#x27;s End is where the Ludlow Road curves round the foot of the hillside to the south of the Long Mynd Hotel. To the north of the town centre is an area called Ashbrook; here the Carding Mill Valley meets the town, with the stream (known as the Ashbrook as it runs through the town) running between the town&#x27;s two main recreation fields (named Russell&#x27;s Meadow and Richard Robinson Field). Two other notable areas of public parkland are Rectory Wood &amp; Field, situated to the west of the town centre off Church Street, and the town&#x27;s formal park between the A49 and the railway line, which is managed by the town council and includes tennis courts and a bowling green.

On the eastern side of the A49 road are three named areas: Battle Field, Snatchfield and Hazler. On Hazler Hill is a transmitter for local radio (BBC Radio Shropshire broadcast from here on 90FM). Battle Field is named for the legend that Caer Caradoc was the site of the last stand of Caractacus against the Roman legions during the Roman conquest of Britain, and that after the battle he hid in the cave near its summit.
===All Stretton and Little Stretton===
The villages of All Stretton and Little Stretton remain separate settlements to Church Stretton. The B5477 connects the three settlements, with Church Stretton roughly midway between – All Stretton is north of the centre of Church Stretton, whilst Little Stretton is south. Although there is some ribbon development along the B5477, the three settlements are not joined, although the gap between the nearest buildings of All Stretton and Church Stretton is a mere and the road signs (on the B5477) welcoming people into those two settlements lie back-to-back. The B5477 continues as Shrewsbury Road as it passes through All Stretton and likewise continues as Ludlow Road as it passes through Little Stretton. The three settlements are sometimes known collectively as &quot;the Strettons&quot;, a name also given to the wider area including the surrounding hills.

==Governance==
===Parish and town council===
The town is located within the civil parish of Church Stretton, and is administered by a parish council called Church Stretton Town council. The parish (and the town council) also cover the neighbouring villages of All Stretton, Little Stretton, and the hamlets of Minton and Hamperley, and other outlying settlements including Botvyle and part of Marshbrook. The parish has an area of and is divided into four wards: Church Stretton North (represented by four councillors on the town council), Church Stretton South (represented by five councillors), All Stretton and Little Stretton (each represented by two councillors). Between 1966 and 2002, the parish council was not termed a town council and there was no mayor, a situation which was remedied by a resolution of the council in May 2001.

Sometimes the parish is referred to as &quot;Church Stretton and Little Stretton&quot;; the present-day parish was formed by the addition of the former Little Stretton parish and part of All Stretton parish (the remainder still exists as a separate parish). This is effectively a return to the situation before 1899, when the old civil parish of Church Stretton was split into three, though the modern parish does not include that part of All Stretton parish that was not transferred in 1934.
The Town Council have their offices at 60 High Street and hold their meetings at the nearby Silvester Horne Institute, also on High Street.

====Mayors====
Below is a complete list of mayors of Church Stretton. Formally the mayor of a town council is a Town Mayor. One of the town councillors is elected by the council (at the &#x27;Annual Meeting&#x27; in May) as jointly chairman and Town Mayor. Although Church Stretton&#x27;s parish council became a town council in 2002, the title of Town Mayor was not bestowed upon the chairman until 2004.

===Local government===
Church Stretton was an ancient parish. When elected parish and district councils were created in 1894 it was given a parish council and included in the Church Stretton Rural District. The parish was removed from the rural district in 1899 to become its own urban district. It was downgraded to a rural parish again in 1966, becoming part of Ludlow Rural District (the Church Stretton Rural District had already been abolished in 1934). The Urban District Council was based at offices on Beaumont Road, where Beaumont Court now is. In 1974 the system of urban and rural districts was replaced and the town came under South Shropshire non-metropolitan district and Shropshire non-metropolitan county. The most recent change in local government occurred in 2009 when South Shropshire District Council and the other districts in the county were abolished and Shropshire County Council took over their functions, making it a unitary authority; the county council changed its name to Shropshire Council at the same time.

Church Stretton is part of the Shropshire Council electoral division (or ward) of &#x27;Church Stretton and Craven Arms&#x27;. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 8,936. In the 2009 council elections the electorate of this ward returned two councillors, both Conservative.

===Member of Parliament===
On a national level, Church Stretton is located within the South Shropshire constituency, and the current Member of Parliament (&quot;MP&quot;) for that constituency is Stuart Anderson, a Conservative, since the 2024 general election.

==Geology==

The local geology is complex; the area lies astride the Church Stretton Fault and atop some of the oldest rocks in England – formed over 560 million years ago. On 2 April 1990, another nearby fault – the Pontesford-Linley Fault – registered an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 on the Richter scale, known as the Bishop&#x27;s Castle earthquake. The area also plays a part in the history of geology, Comley Quarry is about from the town and the first site in the British Isles where trilobites were recorded, and gave its name to a regional subdivision of the Cambrian period.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The A49, a primary route and trunk road, runs through the Stretton Gap, connecting Shrewsbury to the north with Ludlow and Hereford to the south. The B5477 runs through the villages of All Stretton and Little Stretton, as well as the historic core and town centre of Church Stretton. The B4371 starts at the B5477 in the town centre and heads east, crosses over a crossroads junction with the A49, then up to Hazler and on towards Much Wenlock. The B4371 in the town, on both sides of the A49, is known as &quot;Sandford Avenue&quot; and is partially lined with lime trees.

The B5477 had been the northern section of the B4370, which was renumbered in 2004; this renumbering to B5477 is anomalous in two ways: the number does not comply with the Great Britain road numbering scheme (it is &quot;out-of-zone&quot;) and was already (and remains) in use in Wallasey.

====The Burway====
The Burway is an ancient route which leads up from the town to the plateau on the Long Mynd. It is Shropshire&#x27;s highest public road, reaching above sea level and passing close to the highest point of the Long Mynd, called Pole Bank (516 m). Running along the plateau of the Long Mynd is another ancient route called the Portway, though not all of this is open to motor traffic. The Burway is a through route, allowing traffic (though not goods vehicles, caravans or similar) to cross over the Long Mynd westwards to Ratlinghope or Asterton (the route splits into two at Boiling Well).

In winter, deep snow sometimes makes the Burway impassable. In 2015, snow gates were installed at various points of access onto the Long Mynd to deter motorists from using the routes in wintry conditions. The gliding club at the southern end of the Long Mynd can be accessed via the Burway from either Asterton or Church Stretton. The part of the road within the town is called Burway Road and begins at the crossroads in the town centre, where the B5477 and B4371 meet.

===Railway===


The Welsh Marches Line runs through the town parallel to, and west of, the A49 road. The town&#x27;s station is off Sandford Avenue, just east of the town centre, near to the junction of the A49 and B4371.

The railway was built originally as the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway in 1852. Trains on the Heart of Wales Line also call at the station. Today, there are direct train services to Shrewsbury, Chester, Holyhead, Crewe, Manchester, Ludlow, Hereford, Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. The station has a large number of passengers using it, considering the town&#x27;s population; it is the eighth busiest station in Shropshire (2017-18 figures).

===Buses===
The town is served by the 435 bus route, which runs between Shrewsbury and Ludlow; it is operated by Minsterley Motors Monday-Saturday. This connects the town with All Stretton, Dorrington and Condover towards Shrewsbury, and Little Stretton, Craven Arms and Bromfield towards Ludlow.

In addition, there are two Shropshire Hills Shuttles services that operate at weekends and on Bank Holidays during the spring and summer. One route runs over the Long Mynd to Ratlinghope and Bridges, Stiperstones, Habberley, Pulverbatch, Minsterley and Pontesbury. The other route, called the &quot;Wenlock Wanderer&quot;, runs to Much Wenlock via Little Stretton, Marshbrook, Acton Scott, Ticklerton and then along the B4371 which runs along the top of the Wenlock Edge to the market town of Much Wenlock.

All bus services call at Beaumont Road in the town centre. The Shuttles services also both call at Carding Mill Valley.

===Cycling===
Regional Cycle Route 32/33 runs through the town, on its way from Shrewsbury to Craven Arms. The route avoids cycling along the busy A49 main road, with the exception of a stretch north of Craven Arms. The area is popular with mountain bikers, due to the number of bridleways and country lanes in the hilly countryside.

==Economy==

The mineral water extraction and bottling plant on Shrewsbury Road (known locally as the &#x27;Pop Works&#x27;), has been operating since 1883; since 2004 it has provided Princes with mineral water. It is a notable local employer as is the polymer laboratories off Essex Road, currently owned by Agilent Technologies (until 2009 by Varian). There is a designated light industrial area between the A49 and the railway line, known as Crossways, with a number of businesses, many of which are in the motoring trade, including an independent petrol/diesel filling station.

The town benefits from tourism, which is a growth industry in the area, as well as attracting local trade. A recent survey showed that the town has some 50 retail outlets, 44 of which are independently owned, with a diverse range of shop types. These include two butchers, several outdoor activities shops, a baker, a delicatessen, several clothes and shoe shops, three banks, and two supermarkets (Co-op and Spar). There is a large antiques market, situated in a former malthouse on the corner of Sandford Avenue and Easthope Road. There are four pubs, as well as a number of cafes and small restaurants. In June 2011 the town was officially declared to be a &quot;Fairtrade Town&quot; with 34 businesses selling fair trade products. There is a small art gallery in the former hotel on the corner of Shrewsbury Road and Sandford Avenue. The town also has a number of professional services, such as solicitors, accountants and estate agents, confirming its status as a local centre of business.

The town continues to benefit from its reputation as a spa town, and a desirable place to live, especially in retirement. House prices are above the county average and have seen similar increases in recent times to other spa towns in the UK.

The 2001 census recorded the parish&#x27;s employment rate at 54.2%, whilst unemployment was at 1.9% (both are percentages of residents aged 16–74), and 18.7% of all residents were retired. The largest sector of employment was &quot;wholesale and retail trade, and repair of motor vehicles&quot; with 16.7% of all employment in that sector.

==Culture and sport==

The novelist Henry Kingsley (1830–1876) wrote &quot;Stretton&quot; based around this area, and Oliver Sandys&#x27; book, &quot;Quaint Place&quot; is set in Church Stretton. Mary Webb&#x27;s works also made reference to the town, under the name &quot;Shepwardine&quot;. The Lone Pine Club series of children&#x27;s books by Malcolm Saville is also partly set in the area.

Church Stretton is a major centre for the sport of archery, and there is also a gliding air field and station atop the Long Mynd, owned by the Midland Gliding Club. As well as gliding, the activities of paragliding, hang gliding and similar aerial pursuits take place from the Long Mynd. Church Stretton became a Walkers Are Welcome town in 2009, the first in the West Midlands, and its many well-maintained footpaths over the Long Mynd and the Stretton Hills help make it a major walking centre for Shropshire.
In the town itself, sports facilities are provided adjacent to the schools, just off Shrewsbury Road, which include a swimming pool and a recently opened 4 court sports &amp; leisure centre, and the town council provide facilities (such as a BMX facility, crazy golf, hard tennis courts, a bowling green and a croquet pitch) at the town park (situated between the A49 and the railway).

===Summer festival===
In recent times, on a June Saturday the town holds a summer festival (&quot;Summerfest&quot;), organised by volunteers and the town&#x27;s chamber of trade. The town centre&#x27;s streets and car parks are closed to traffic, as stalls, entertainment and activities take place throughout the town, including a classic car and steam rally. In the evening there is a concert in Rectory Field.

===Churches===

The town has four churches. In the centre of the town is the historic parish church dedicated to Lawrence of Rome, situated on the corner of Churchway and Church Street, and with its own small graveyard surrounding it. (This graveyard was succeeded by a cemetery at the foot of Cunnery Road, which in turn has been replaced by one near Brockhurst.) It is the town&#x27;s Church of England church and is one of three in the ecclesiastical parish of Church Stretton, along with the churches in All Stretton and Little Stretton (which were built around 1900). The parish is part of the Diocese of Hereford. The church&#x27;s name is written either as &quot;Lawrence&quot; or &quot;Laurence&quot;, though the latter is used more for the church itself. St Laurence&#x27;s Church has a remnant of its Anglo-Saxon origins: a stone carved fertility symbol called a Sheela na gig.

The other three churches in the town are: the United Reformed Church on Ludlow Road; a Roman Catholic church dedicated to St Milburga (a local saint), situated on the corner of Sandford Avenue and Watling Street; and a Methodist church situated on the corner of Crossways and Watling Street.

===Golf course===

There is an 18-hole golf course about a km from the town centre, the Church Stretton Golf Club. The course is 5,030 yards long and has a par of 66. It is one of the highest golf courses in the country, being located on the side of the Long Mynd hill range (the course is situated on the slopes of Stanyeld Hill and Bodbury Hill). The is at approximately 230 m (755 ft) above sea level and the hilly links course rises up to around 375 m (1,230 ft). Apart from the clubhouse, putting green and first hole, the course is situated on common land owned by the National Trust (who own most of the Long Mynd upland area).

The town&#x27;s golf course is the oldest 18-hole course in Shropshire, with the club starting in 1898 and the final holes being completed around 1904. The course was primarily designed by John (Jack) Morris and James Hepburn. James Braid and Harry Vardon later made changes to the course.

Open Champions James Braid, Harry Vardon and J. H. Taylor (together referred to as the Great Triumvirate) all played at the course many times, albeit at different times, during the pre-World War I years of the club&#x27;s existence.

===Football===

Church Stretton Town F.C. (usually called simply &quot;Stretton&quot;) is a football team who currently play in the West Midlands Regional League Division 2. Home games are played at Russell&#x27;s Meadow, located near the centre of the town off Lutwyche Road (). The home kit is black and white (thick) vertical stripes.

There has been a football field at Russell&#x27;s Meadow since the 1930s, though the pavilion moved (c. 1950s) from the other side of the Ashbrook to its present location near Lutwyche Road. There is a community project on-going to raise funds and then build a new pavilion at Russell&#x27;s Meadow. In 2011 funding was secured from Sport England to improve the five existing football pitches and create two new training pitches, on both Russell&#x27;s Meadow and neighbouring Robinson&#x27;s Field. Russell&#x27;s Meadow is also home to a separate football club for under-16s – the Church Stretton Magpies — and to Sunday league football. The home colours of both the Town and Magpies teams is black and white.

===Cricket===
During the summer, Russell&#x27;s Meadow and its pavilion are used to play cricket. Church Stretton Cricket Club have a Saturday First XI playing in the Shropshire County Cricket League Division Five and a Friendly XI that play on Sundays against Shropshire teams and touring sides.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Wrekin TV transmitter and one of the two relay transmitters (Hazler Hill and Whittingslow). 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire on 90.0 FM, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire on 103.1 FM, Capital North West &amp; Wales 103.4 FM, and Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire on 107.4 FM. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Shropshire Star&quot;. 

==Public services==

===Education===
Church Stretton has two state-funded schools: Church Stretton School, a secondary school with 750 pupils and a primary school (named &quot;St Lawrence&quot;) with 210 pupils. The two schools neighbour one other and are situated just off Shrewsbury Road, on the northern edge of Church Stretton. The Council also operates a public library, on Church Street, situated in former, Victorian school buildings, which is also the town&#x27;s tourist information centre and information point for Shropshire Council services.

===Emergency services===

At the junction of Sandford Avenue and Essex Road, in the centre of the town, is a police station (West Mercia Police) staffed Monday-Friday and a fire station (Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service) with two engines and staffed by retained firefighters. The present fire station was built in the early 1970s – it was previously on Beaumont Road, where Beaumont Court now is – whilst the police station was built in the 1990s – it was on Shrewsbury Road where Longmynd Place now is.

===Health===
There is a doctors&#x27; surgery and medical clinic on Easthope Road. The nearest ambulance station is in Shrewsbury (following the closure of the Craven Arms Community Ambulance Station in 2021) and the nearest major hospital is the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.

==Notable people==

Sir John Thynne (c.1515 in Church Stretton – 1580) was the steward to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (c. 1506 – 1552) and a member of parliament. He was the builder of Longleat House and his descendants became Marquesses of Bath.

Hesba Stretton came to Church Stretton often before moving away from Shropshire, becoming an established author. There is a plaque to her memory in St. Laurence&#x27;s Church together with a window depicting the figure of &quot;Jessica&quot; from her immensely popular story &quot;Jessica&#x27;s First Prayer&quot;. A sister owned a house, Caradoc Lodge in neighbouring All Stretton, the latter village (within Church Stretton parish) said to be the source of her pen-surname.

Although he did not live there, artist Sir Frederic Leighton took his peerage title of Baron Leighton of Stretton in the County of Salop, created the day before his death in 1896, from this place. There is a window to his memory in St Laurence&#x27;s Church.

Tristram Speedy, explorer and adventurer, died on 9 August 1910 at Chatsworth, Church Stretton.
The &#x27;White House&#x27; nursing home on Sandford Avenue, demolished in 2006 to make way for a housing development, was previously the family home of Silvester Horne a Congregationalist minister, Liberal MP for Ipswich, and father of the BBC broadcaster Kenneth Horne. The town&#x27;s Silvester Horne Institute, on the south end of High Street, commemorates his name. He is buried in the cemetery on Cunnery Road. Amateur footballer Frederick Green (1851–1928), winning side veteran of FA Cup Final of 1874 for Oxford University and of 1877 and 1878 for the Wanderers, died at his last home in the town, The Uplands.

Residents of the town did include Pete Postlethwaite, who used to live in Minton, near Little Stretton, which was the home of Oliver Sandys. Greg Hearle, the renowned clarinetist, is a local resident. Also, the Olympic bronze-medal archer, Alison Williamson lives in All Stretton and is a member of the town&#x27;s archery club. John Jones (born 1930 in Church Stretton-2011) was a British rower who competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki with the men&#x27;s coxless four where they came fourth. In the 1930s, E. M. Almedingen, the biographer and children&#x27;s writer, lived in the town, and, following retirement, the writer Kenneth Bird (also known by his pen name Fougasse) moved to Church Stretton.

Two Archdeacons of Ludlow were also resident Rectors of Church Stretton, Henry Dixon in 1923-36 and Herbert Whately from 1937 to his death in 1947.
George Nickson, former Bishop of Bristol died in retirement at Church Stretton in 1949.
William Alonzo Parker, former Anglican Bishop of Shrewsbury, lived in retirement at Church Stretton before his death in 1982.

Archaeologist Lily Chitty died at the Hillside Rest Home in Church Stretton in 1979.

Stephen Laurie, a notable amateur astronomer, lives in the area and has discovered a number of asteroids from observatories at Church Stretton and nearby Ragdon (the area not suffering from much light pollution). One of the asteroids discovered has been named after the town — 11626 Church Stretton.

Former Jaguar chief test driver (and brand ambassador) Norman Dewis lived in the town after his retirement in 1986.

Stuntman Justin Pearson was born and raised in the town and educated at Church Stretton School, leaving in 1988 to attend Ludlow College.

<text>In the Philippines, regions (; ISO 3166-2:PH) are administrative divisions that primarily serve to coordinate planning and organize national government services across multiple local government units (LGUs). Most national government offices provide services through their regional branches instead of having direct provincial or city offices. Regional offices are usually but not necessarily located in the city designated as the regional center.

As of 2024, the Philippines is divided into 18 regions. Seventeen of these are mere administrative groupings, each provided by the president of the Philippines with a regional development council (RDC) – in the case of the National Capital Region (Metro Manila), an additional metropolitan development authority serves as the coordinating and policy-making body. Only one, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, has an elected government and parliament to which the Congress of the Philippines has delegated certain powers and responsibilities.

== History ==
Regions first came to existence on September 24, 1972, when the provinces of the Philippines were organized into eleven regions under Presidential Decree No. 1 as part of the Integrated Reorganization Plan of President Ferdinand Marcos. Since that time, other regions have been created and some provinces have been transferred from one region to another.

== List of regions ==
, the Philippines is divided into 18 regions. The traditional island groups of Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao are composed of eight (Regions I, II, III, IV-A, and V, and CAR, NCR, and Mimaropa), four (VI, VII, VIII, and NIR), and six (IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and BARMM) regions, respectively. The names of Calabarzon, Mimaropa, and Soccsksargen are acronyms signifying their component provinces and cities; and are usually capitalized in official government documents.

=== Types of regions ===
==== Administrative region ====
An administrative region is a grouping of geographically adjacent LGUs that may be established, disestablished, and modified by the president of the Philippines based on the need to formulate coherent economic development policies, more efficiently provide national government services, and coordinate activities beneficial to the development of larger area beyond the province level. No plebiscites have been conducted so far to democratically confirm the creation, abolition or alteration of the boundaries of regular administrative regions, as the Constitution does not mandate it.

An administrative region is not a local government unit (LGU), but rather a group of LGUs to which the president has provided an unelected policy-making and coordinating structure, called the Regional Development Council (RDC). Metro Manila is recognized in law as a &quot;special development and administrative region&quot;, and was thus given the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA); the Metro Manila Council within the MMDA serves as the National Capital Region&#x27;s RDC.

==== Autonomous region ====
The 1987 Constitution allows for the creation of autonomous regions in the Cordillera Central of Luzon and the Muslim-majority areas of Mindanao. However, only the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and its predecessor, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, have been approved by voters in plebiscites held in 1989, 2001, and 2019. Voters in the Cordilleras rejected autonomy in 1990 and 1998; hence the Cordillera Administrative Region remains as a regular administrative region with no delegated powers or responsibilities.
The Supreme Court has ruled that an autonomous region established by statute must be composed of more than one province, thereby invalidating the proposed establishment of the &quot;Autonomous Region of Ifugao&quot; following the results of the original 1990 Cordillera autonomy plebiscite, which saw only Ifugao&#x27;s voters casting a majority &#x27;yes&#x27; vote towards autonomy.

=== Table of regions ===
* &quot;Component local government units&quot;: the data column is limited to primary LGUs, which pertains to component provinces, &quot;highly urbanized&quot; cities, and &quot;independent component&quot; cities, as well as the independent municipality of Pateros. All city names, except those under the National Capital Region, are &quot;italicized&quot;.
* &quot;Location&quot;: the location map column can be sorted from north-to-south, west-to-east.

=== Judicial regions ===

As far as the judiciary is concerned, specifically the first and second level courts, the country is divided into judicial regions as provided by &quot;Batas Pambansa Bilang 129&quot;. The coverage of these judicial regions generally coincides with that of the administrative regions in 1980, with some exceptions.

=== Legislative districts ===
Representation for the Interim Batasang Pambansa was mostly through parliamentary districts based on how regions were organized in 1978. Metro Manila was &quot;Region IV&quot;, while Southern Tagalog was &quot;Region IV-A&quot;. This was the only time the national legislature was represented via regions; in a 1984 plebiscite, voters approved a constitutional amendment that reverted to representation per province and city.

== Proposed regions ==
* Cordillera Autonomous Region (proposal to convert the Cordillera Administrative Region into an autonomous region; see Cordillera autonomy movement)
* Samar Administrative Region
* Bangsa Sug or Basulta Autonomous Region (proposed to separate the Sulu Archipelago from the mainland portion of Bangsamoro)

== Defunct regions ==
The following are regions that no longer exist, listed along with their current status:
* Southern Tagalog (Region IV, now divided into Calabarzon, Central Luzon (Aurora), Metro Manila (several cities that were part of Rizal), and Mimaropa; the name remains as a cultural-geographic region only)
* Western Mindanao (renamed as Zamboanga Peninsula, still designated as Region IX)
* Central Mindanao (now mostly Soccsksargen, still designated as Region XII)
* Southern Mindanao (now mostly Davao Region, still designated as Region XI)
* Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (replaced by Bangsamoro)

<text>South Shropshire was a local government district in Shropshire, England, from 1974 to 2009. Its council was based in the town of Ludlow; the other towns in the district were Church Stretton, Cleobury Mortimer, Clun, Bishop&#x27;s Castle and Craven Arms.

South Shropshire was the most rural district of one of the UK&#x27;s most rural counties, the population of the district was 40,410 in 2001 spread out over 1,027 km2 of forest, mountains, moorlands, hills and mixed quality farmland. It bordered the unitary authority of Powys in Wales, which it closely resembled, economically, socially, culturally and historically. 65% of the district&#x27;s area is part of the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The district was created on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of the rural districts of Clun and Bishop&#x27;s Castle and Ludlow.

The district and its council were abolished on 1 April 2009 when the new Shropshire unitary authority was established, as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

==History==
South Shropshire had many ancient monuments, with Mitchells Fold on the Welsh border being the most notable, and there is evidence of Neolithic quarrying in the Apedale.
The area seems to have been settled by the Ordovices, an Iron Age tribe of people in the last millennium BC, and was a stronghold of the Celtic chieftain Caractacus (Caer Caradoc is said to be named after him). The area was probably part of the &quot;Military&quot; division of the Roman occupation and locals claim that the Romans mined lead in the north west of the district.

In the Early Middle Ages, the area was a battleground between the Welsh and the Anglo Saxon Kingdom of Mercia and Offa&#x27;s Dyke, which is partially in the district, is a permanent reminder of the areas border status. In the Middle Ages, South Shropshire was part of the Welsh Marches, a lawless area ruled by tyrannical feudal lords, who as Marcher Lords had de facto independence from the King of England.

During the English Civil War the area was generally spared from fighting, although there was a small massacre at Hopton Castle and Ludlow Castle was captured by Parliamentary troops.

During the Industrial Revolution, coal was mined around Clee Hill and lead was mined near the border with Wales, e.g. at Snailbeach. Church Stretton was a centre of textile manufacture and Ludlow thrived on the malting trade, while the rest of the area was populated by smallholders. The economy of the area was fragile, and most industry in the area had collapsed by 1900.

The administrative area of South Shropshire was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 as one of six non-metropolitan districts within Shropshire. It covered the area of two former districts:
* Clun and Bishop&#x27;s Castle Rural District (which included the rural borough of Bishop&#x27;s Castle)
* Ludlow Rural District (which included the rural borough of Ludlow)

The district and its council were abolished on 31 March 2009, with the area becoming part of the new Shropshire Council unitary authority from 1 April 2009, as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

==Geography==

The District of South Shropshire covered an area of 1,028 square kilometres, or , which was roughly one third of the administrative county of Shropshire as of 2008.

South Shropshire included mountains, valleys, hills, moors, forests and low grade farmland. The landscape is often rugged, with crags and rock outcrops very common, especially in the west and around the Clee Hills, and was for the most part gouged by glaciers during the ice age. The area&#x27;s many rock types made it particularly interesting to geologists, with Wenlock Edge being especially noteworthy.

See the Shropshire Hills AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) for more about the natural geography of the area.

==Economics and demographics==
Economically the district was largely dependent on tourism, partly due to the decline in the economic significance of farming and also the decline and subsequent end of local lead and coal mining industry. In addition to tourism, some light industry did exist in the district, in the Church Stretton and Ludlow areas, and in Burford, near Tenbury Wells.

Additionally, the local demographics show a large economic gap between affluent residents and poorer communities. Many of the affluent residents have moved into the area from other places, such as South East England on their retirement. This continues an older trend whose root was initially in the imbalance of wealth associated with the farming economy previously prevalent in the area.
===Energy policy===
In May 2006, a report commissioned by British Gas showed that housing in South Shropshire produced the 13th highest average carbon emissions in the country at 7,156 kg of carbon dioxide per dwelling.

==Political control==
The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was held by the following parties:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council from 2003 until its abolition in 2009 were:

==Council elections==
*1973 South Shropshire District Council election
*1976 South Shropshire District Council election (New ward boundaries)
*1979 South Shropshire District Council election
*1983 South Shropshire District Council election
*1987 South Shropshire District Council election (District boundary changes took place but the number of seats remained the same)

<text>A vampire tap (also called a piercing tap) is a device for physically connecting a station, typically a computer, to a network that used 10BASE5 cabling. This device clamped onto and &quot;bit&quot; into the cable (hence the name &quot;vampire&quot;), inserting a probe through a hole drilled using a special tool through the outer shielding to contact the inner conductor, while other spikes bit into the outer conductor.

The vampire tap usually had an integrated AUI (Attachment Unit Interface) in the form of a DA-15 connector, from which a short multicore cable connected to the network card in the station (host computer).

Vampire taps allowed new connections to be made on a given physical cable while the cable was in use. This allowed administrators to expand bus topology network sections without interrupting communications. Without a vampire tap, the cable had to be cut and connectors had to be attached to both ends.

<text>A commutator is a rotary electrical switch in certain types of electric motors and electrical generators that periodically reverses the current direction between the rotor and the external circuit. It consists of a cylinder composed of multiple metal contact segments on the rotating armature of the machine. Two or more electrical contacts called &quot;brushes&quot; made of a soft conductive material like carbon press against the commutator, making sliding contact with successive segments of the commutator as it rotates. The windings (coils of wire) on the armature are connected to the commutator segments.

Commutators are used in direct current (DC) machines: dynamos (DC generators) and many DC motors as well as universal motors. In a motor the commutator applies electric current to the windings. By reversing the current direction in the rotating windings each half turn, a steady rotating force (torque) is produced. In a generator the commutator picks off the current generated in the windings, reversing the direction of the current with each half turn, serving as a mechanical rectifier to convert the alternating current from the windings to unidirectional direct current in the external load circuit. The first direct current commutator-type machine, the dynamo, was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832, based on a suggestion by André-Marie Ampère.

Commutators are relatively inefficient, and also require periodic maintenance such as brush replacement. Therefore, commutated machines are declining in use, being replaced by alternating current (AC) machines, and in recent years by brushless DC motors which use semiconductor switches. 
==Principle of operation==

A commutator consists of a set of contact bars fixed to the rotating shaft of a machine, and connected to the armature windings. As the shaft rotates, the commutator reverses the flow of current in a winding. For a single armature winding, when the shaft has made one-half complete turn, the winding is now connected so that current flows through it in the opposite of the initial direction. In a motor, the armature current causes the fixed magnetic field to exert a rotational force, or a torque, on the winding to make it turn. In a generator, the mechanical torque applied to the shaft maintains the motion of the armature winding through the stationary magnetic field, inducing a current in the winding. In both the motor and generator case, the commutator periodically reverses the direction of current flow through the winding so that current flow in the circuit external to the machine continues in only one direction.

===Simplest practical commutator===

Practical commutators have at least three contact segments, to prevent a &quot;dead&quot; spot where two brushes simultaneously bridge only two commutator segments. Brushes are made wider than the insulated gap, to ensure that brushes are always in contact with an armature coil. For commutators with at least three segments, although the rotor can potentially stop in a position where two commutator segments touch one brush, this only de-energizes one of the rotor arms while the others will still function correctly. With the remaining rotor arms, a motor can produce sufficient torque to begin spinning the rotor, and a generator can provide useful power to an external circuit.

==Ring/segment construction==

A commutator consists of a set of copper segments, fixed around the part of the circumference of the rotating machine, or the rotor, and a set of spring-loaded brushes fixed to the stationary frame of the machine. Two or more fixed brushes connect to the external circuit, either a source of current for a motor or a load for a generator.

Commutator segments are connected to the coils of the armature, with the number of coils (and commutator segments) depending on the speed and voltage of the machine. Large motors may have hundreds of segments.
Each conducting segment of the commutator is insulated from adjacent segments. Mica was used on early machines and is still used on large machines. Many other insulating materials are used to insulate smaller machines; plastics allow quick manufacture of an insulator, for example. The segments are held onto the shaft using a dovetail shape on the edges or underside of each segment. Insulating wedges around the perimeter of each segment are pressed so that the commutator maintains its mechanical stability throughout its normal operating range.

In small appliance and tool motors the segments are typically crimped permanently in place and cannot be removed. When the motor fails it is discarded and replaced. On large industrial machines (say, from several kilowatts to thousands of kilowatts in rating) it is economical to replace individual damaged segments, and so the end-wedge can be unscrewed and individual segments removed and replaced.

Replacing the copper and mica segments is commonly referred to as &quot;refilling&quot;. Refillable dovetailed commutators are the most common construction of larger industrial type commutators, but refillable commutators may also be constructed using external bands made of fiberglass (glass banded construction) or forged steel rings (external steel shrink ring type construction and internal steel shrink ring type construction).

Disposable, molded type commutators commonly found in smaller DC motors are becoming increasingly more common in larger electric motors. Molded type commutators are not repairable and must be replaced if damaged.

In addition to the commonly used heat, torque, and tonnage methods of seasoning commutators, some high performance commutator applications require a more expensive, specific &quot;spin seasoning&quot; process or over-speed spin-testing to guarantee stability of the individual segments and prevent premature wear of the carbon brushes. Such requirements are common with traction, military, aerospace, nuclear, mining, and high speed applications where clamping failure and segment or insulation protrusion can lead to serious negative consequences.

Friction between the segments and the brushes eventually causes wear to both surfaces. Carbon brushes, being made of a softer material, wear faster and may be designed to be replaced easily without dismantling the machine. Older copper brushes caused more wear to the commutator, causing deep grooving and notching of the surface over time.

The commutator on small motors (say, less than a kilowatt rating) is not designed to be repaired through the life of the device. On large industrial equipment, the commutator may be re-surfaced with abrasives, or the rotor may be removed from the frame, mounted in a large metal lathe, and the commutator resurfaced by cutting it down to a smaller diameter. The largest of equipment can include a lathe turning attachment directly over the commutator.

==Brush construction==
Early machines used brushes made from strands of copper wire to contact the surface of the commutator. However, these hard metal brushes tended to scratch and groove the smooth commutator segments, eventually requiring resurfacing of the commutator. As the copper brushes wore away, the dust and pieces of the brush could wedge between commutator segments, shorting them and reducing the efficiency of the device. Fine copper wire mesh or gauze provided better surface contact with less segment wear, but gauze brushes were more expensive than strip or wire copper brushes.

Modern rotating machines with commutators almost exclusively use carbon brushes, which may have copper powder mixed in to improve conductivity. Metallic copper brushes can be found in toy or very small motors, such as the one illustrated above, and some motors which only operate very intermittently, such as automotive starter motors.

Motors and generators suffer from a phenomenon known as &#x27;armature reaction&#x27;, one of the effects of which is to change the position at which the current reversal through the windings should ideally take place as the loading varies. Early machines had the brushes mounted on a ring that was provided with a handle. During operation, it was necessary to adjust the position of the brush ring to adjust the commutation to minimise the sparking at the brushes. This process was known as &#x27;rocking the brushes&#x27;.

Various developments took place to automate the process of adjusting the commutation and minimizing the sparking at the brushes. One of these was the development of &#x27;high resistance brushes&#x27;, or brushes made from a mixture of copper powder and carbon. Although described as high resistance brushes, the resistance of such a brush was of the order of milliohms, the exact value dependent on the size and function of the machine. Also, the high resistance brush was not constructed like a brush but in the form of a carbon block with a curved face to match the shape of the commutator.

The high resistance or carbon brush is made large enough that it is significantly wider than the insulating segment that it spans (and on large machines may often span two insulating segments). The result of this is that as the commutator segment passes from under the brush, the current passing to it ramps down more smoothly than had been the case with pure copper brushes where the contact broke suddenly. Similarly the segment coming into contact with the brush has a similar ramping up of the current. Thus, although the current passing through the brush was more or less constant, the instantaneous current passing to the two commutator segments was proportional to the relative area in contact with the brush.

The introduction of the carbon brush had convenient side effects. Carbon brushes tend to wear more evenly than copper brushes, and the soft carbon causes far less damage to the commutator segments. There is less sparking with carbon as compared to copper, and as the carbon wears away, the higher resistance of carbon results in fewer problems from the dust collecting on the commutator segments.

The ratio of copper to carbon can be changed for a particular purpose. Brushes with higher copper content perform better with very low voltages and high current, while brushes with a higher carbon content are better for high voltage and low current. High copper content brushes typically carry 150 to 200 amperes per square inch of contact surface, while higher carbon content only carries 40 to 70 amperes per square inch. The higher resistance of carbon also results in a greater voltage drop of 0.8 to 1.0 volts per contact, or 1.6 to 2.0 volts across the commutator.

=== Brush holders ===

A spring is typically used with the brush, to maintain constant contact with the commutator. As the brush and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes the brush downwards towards the commutator. Eventually the brush wears small and thin enough that steady contact is no longer possible or it is no longer securely held in the brush holder, and so the brush must be replaced.

It is common for a flexible power cable to be directly attached to the brush, because current flowing through the support spring would cause heating, which may lead to a loss of metal temper and a loss of the spring tension.

When a commutated motor or generator uses more power than a single brush is capable of conducting, an assembly of several brush holders is mounted in parallel across the surface of the very large commutator. This parallel holder distributes current evenly across all the brushes, and permits a careful operator to remove a bad brush and replace it with a new one, even as the machine continues to spin fully powered and under load.

High power, high current commutated equipment is now uncommon, due to the less complex design of alternating current generators that permits a low current, high voltage spinning field coil to energize high current fixed-position stator coils. This permits the use of very small singular brushes in the alternator design. In this instance, the rotating contacts are continuous rings, called slip rings, and no switching happens.

Modern devices using carbon brushes usually have a maintenance-free design that requires no adjustment throughout the life of the device, using a fixed-position brush holder slot and a combined brush-spring-cable assembly that fits into the slot. The worn brush is pulled out and a new brush inserted.

===Brush contact angle===


The different brush types make contact with the commutator in different ways. Because copper brushes have the same hardness as the commutator segments, the rotor cannot be spun backwards against the ends of copper brushes without the copper digging into the segments and causing severe damage. Consequently, strip/laminate copper brushes only make tangential contact with the commutator, while copper mesh and wire brushes use an inclined contact angle touching their edge across the segments of a commutator that can spin in only one direction.

The softness of carbon brushes permits direct radial end-contact with the commutator without damage to the segments, permitting easy reversal of rotor direction, without the need to reorient the brush holders for operation in the opposite direction. Although never reversed, common appliance motors that use wound rotors, commutators and brushes have radial-contact brushes. In the case of a reaction-type carbon brush holder, carbon brushes may be reversely inclined with the commutator so that the commutator tends to push against the carbon for firm contact.
== The commutating plane ==
The contact point where a brush touches the commutator is referred to as the &quot;commutating plane&quot;. To conduct sufficient current to or from the commutator, the brush contact area is not a thin line but instead a rectangular patch across the segments. Typically the brush is wide enough to span 2.5 commutator segments. This means that two adjacent segments are electrically connected by the brush when it contacts both.
=== Rotation of brushes for stator field distortion ===
Most introductions to motor and generator design start with a simple two-pole device with the brushes arranged at a perfect 90-degree angle from the field. This ideal is useful as a starting point for understanding how the fields interact but it is not how a motor or generator functions in actual practice.

In a real motor or generator, the field around the rotor is never perfectly uniform. Instead, the rotation of the rotor induces field effects which drag and distort the magnetic lines of the outer non-rotating stator.
The faster the rotor spins, the further this degree of field distortion. Because a motor or generator operates most efficiently with the rotor field at right angles to the stator field, it is necessary to either retard or advance the brush position to put the rotor&#x27;s field into the correct position to be at a right angle to the distorted field.

These field effects are reversed when the direction of spin is reversed. It is therefore difficult to build an efficient reversible commutated dynamo, since for highest field strength it is necessary to move the brushes to the opposite side of the normal neutral plane. These effects can be mitigated by a compensation winding in the face of the field pole that carries armature current.

The effect can be considered to be analogous to timing advance in an internal combustion engine. Generally a dynamo that has been designed to run at a certain fixed speed will have its brushes permanently fixed to align the field for highest efficiency at that speed.
==== Further compensation for self-induction ====
Self-induction – The magnetic fields in each coil of wire join and compound together to create a magnetic field that resists changes in the current, which can be likened to the current having inertia.

In the coils of the rotor, even after the brush has been reached, currents tend to continue to flow for a brief moment, resulting in a wasted energy as heat due to the brush spanning across several commutator segments and the current short-circuiting across the segments.

&quot;Spurious resistance&quot; is an apparent increase in the resistance in the armature winding, which is proportional to the speed of the armature, and is due to the lagging of the current.

To minimize sparking at the brushes due to this short-circuiting, the brushes are advanced a few degrees further yet, beyond the advance for field distortions. This moves the rotor winding undergoing commutation slightly forward into the stator field which has magnetic lines in the opposite direction and which oppose the field in the stator. This opposing field helps to reverse the lagging self-inducting current in the stator.

So even for a rotor which is at rest and initially requires no compensation for spinning field distortions, the brushes should still be advanced beyond the perfect 90-degree angle as taught in so many beginners textbooks, to compensate for self-induction.
=== Use of interpoles to correct field distortions ===

Modern motor and generator devices with commutators are able to counteract armature reaction through the use of &quot;interpoles&quot;, which are small field coils and pole pieces positioned approximately halfway between the primary poles of the stator.

By applying a dynamic varying field to the interpoles as the load, RPM, or direction of rotation of the device changes, it is possible to balance out field distortions from armature reaction so that the brush position can remain fixed and sparking across the segments is minimized.

==Limitations and alternatives==
Although direct current motors and dynamos once dominated industry, the disadvantages of the commutator have caused a decline in the use of commutated machines in the last century. These disadvantages are: 
*The sliding friction between the brushes and commutator consumes power, which can be significant in a low power machine. 
*Due to friction, the brushes and copper commutator segments wear down, creating dust. In small consumer products such as power tools and appliances the brushes may last as long as the product, but larger machines require regular replacement of brushes and occasional resurfacing of the commutator. So commutated machines are not used in low particulate or sealed applications or in equipment that must operate for long periods without maintenance. 
*The resistance of the sliding contact between brush and commutator causes a voltage drop called the &quot;brush drop&quot;. This may be several volts, so it can cause large power losses in low voltage, high current machines. Alternating current motors, which do not use commutators, are much more efficient. 
*There is a limit to the maximum current density and voltage which can be switched with a commutator. Very large direct current machines, say, more than several megawatts rating, cannot be built with commutators. The largest motors and generators are all alternating-current machines.
*The switching action of the commutator causes sparking at the contacts, posing a fire hazard in explosive atmospheres, and generating electromagnetic interference.

With the wide availability of alternating current, DC motors have been replaced by more efficient AC synchronous or induction motors. In recent years, with the widespread availability of power semiconductors, in many remaining applications commutated DC motors have been replaced with &quot;brushless direct current motors&quot;. These don&#x27;t have a commutator; instead the direction of the current is switched electronically. A sensor keeps track of the rotor position and semiconductor switches such as transistors reverse the current. Operating life of these machines is much longer, limited mainly by bearing wear.

==Repulsion induction motors==

These are single-phase AC-only motors with higher starting torque than could be obtained with split-phase starting windings, before high-capacitance (non-polar, relatively high-current electrolytic) starting capacitors became practical. They have a conventional wound stator as with any induction motor, but the wire-wound rotor is much like that with a conventional commutator. Brushes opposite each other are connected to each other (not to an external circuit), and transformer action induces currents into the rotor that develop torque by repulsion.

One variety, notable for having an adjustable speed, runs continuously with brushes in contact, while another uses repulsion only for high starting torque and in some cases lifts the brushes once the motor is running fast enough. In the latter case, all commutator segments are connected together as well, before the motor attains running speed.

Once at speed, the rotor windings become functionally equivalent to the squirrel-cage structure of a conventional induction motor, and the motor runs as such.

==Laboratory commutators==
Commutators were used as simple forward-off-reverse switches for electrical experiments in physics laboratories. There are two well-known historical types:

===Ruhmkorff commutator===
This is similar in design to the commutators used in motors and dynamos. It was usually constructed of brass and ivory (later ebonite).

===Pohl commutator===
This consists of a block of wood or ebonite with four wells, containing mercury, which are cross connected by copper wires. The output is taken from a pair of curved copper wires which are moved to dip into one or other pair of mercury wells.
Instead of mercury, ionic liquids or other liquid metals such as galinstan can be used.

<doc id="216795" wikidata="Q781696" url="?curid=216795" title="Slurry wall">
<text>A slurry wall is a civil engineering technique used to build reinforced concrete walls in areas of soft earth close to open water, or with a high groundwater table. This technique is typically used to build diaphragm (water-blocking) walls surrounding tunnels and open cuts, and to lay foundations. Slurry walls are used at Superfund sites to contain the waste or contamination and reduce potential future migration of waste constituents, often with other waste treatment methods. Slurry walls are a &quot;well-established&quot; technology but the decision to use slurry walls for a certain project requires geophysical and other engineering studies to develop a plan appropriate for the needs of that specific location. Slurry walls may need to be used in conjunction with other methods to meet project objectives.

==Construction==

While a trench is being excavated to create a form for a wall, it is simultaneously filled with slurry (usually a mixture of bentonite and water). The dense but liquid slurry prevents the trench from collapsing by providing outward pressure, which balances the inward hydraulic forces and also retards water flow into the trench. The density of the slurry mix must be carefully monitored and adjusted to produce the correct outward pressure to prevent the trench walls from collapsing.

Slurry walls are typically constructed by starting with a set of concrete guide walls, typically deep and thick. The guide walls are constructed near the ground surface to outline the desired slurry trench, and to guide the excavation machinery. Excavation is done using a special clamshell-shaped digger or a hydromill trench cutter, suspended from a crane. The excavator digs down to design depth (or bedrock) for the first wall segment. The excavator is then lifted and moved along the trench guide walls to continue the trench with successive cuts as needed. The trench is at all times kept filled with slurry to prevent its collapse, but the fluid filling allows the excavation machinery and excavation spoil to be moved without hindrance.

Once a particular depth of trench is reached, a reinforcing cage is lowered into the slurry-filled pit and the pit is filled with concrete from the bottom up using tremie pipes. The heavier concrete displaces the bentonite slurry, which is pumped out, filtered, and stored in tanks for use in the next wall segment, or it is recycled.

Slurry walls are successively extended to enclose an area, blocking water and softened earth from flowing into it. Once the concrete has hardened, excavation within the now concrete-wall-enclosed area can proceed. To prevent the concrete wall from collapsing into the newly excavated area, temporary supports such as tiebacks or internal crossbeams are installed. When completed, the structure built within the walled-off area usually supports the wall, so that tiebacks or other temporary bracing may be optionally removed.

==History==
The slurry wall technique was first introduced in the 1950s during the excavations of the Red Line of the Milan Metro in Italy by the company ICOS (Impresa Costruzioni Opere Specializzate). This new technology became an important component of the top-down tunnelling method also known as &quot;Metodo Milano&quot; (&quot;Milan method&quot;).

Slurry wall construction was used in 1967–1968 to construct the &quot;bathtub&quot; that surrounded the foundations of most of the World Trade Center site in New York City. In the 1980s, the Red Line Northwest Extension project in Boston was one of the first projects in the US to use the modern form of the technology, with hydromill trench cutters and the &quot;Milan method&quot;. Slurry walls were also used extensively in Boston&#x27;s 1990s Big Dig tunnel project.

==Design==
The design of a slurry wall (diaphragm wall) includes the design of wall thickness and reinforcements. Thickness of a slurry wall in preliminary design is generally set to about 4-8% of the excavation depth. Slurry wall design is undertaken based on bending moment and shear envelope obtained from the stress analysis. In the design of such underground walls, width of the unit is considered as one meter, and the wall is analyzed under plane strain condition. Since the length-to-width ratio of excavations is generally large, plane strain conditions can be assumed.

In a single-phase diaphragm wall, also known as a &quot;cut-off wall&quot;, a binder (usually cement) is added to the supporting fluid so that the supporting fluid hardens without exchange. One application for this type of construction is a landfill seal that is to be retrofitted later.

<text>Bentonite ( ) is an absorbent swelling clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite (a type of smectite) which can either be Na-montmorillonite or Ca-montmorillonite. Na-montmorillonite has a considerably greater swelling capacity than Ca-montmorillonite.

Bentonite usually forms from the weathering of volcanic ash in seawater, or by hydrothermal circulation through the porosity of volcanic ash beds, which converts (devitrification) the volcanic glass (obsidian, rhyolite, dacite) present in the ash into clay minerals. In the mineral alteration process, a large fraction (up to 40–50 wt.%) of amorphous silica is dissolved and leached away, leaving the bentonite deposit in place. Bentonite beds are white or pale blue or green (traces of reduced ) in fresh exposures, turning to a cream color and then yellow, red, or brown (traces of oxidized ) as the exposure is weathered further.

As a swelling clay, bentonite has the ability to absorb large quantities of water, which increases its volume by up to a factor of eight. This makes bentonite beds unsuitable for building and road construction. However, the swelling property is used to advantage in drilling mud and groundwater sealants. The montmorillonite / smectite making up bentonite is an aluminium phyllosilicate mineral, which takes the form of microscopic platy grains. These give the clay a very large total surface area, making bentonite a valuable adsorbent. The plates also adhere to each other when wet. This gives the clay a cohesiveness that makes it useful as a binder and as an additive to improve the plasticity of kaolinite clay used for pottery.

One of the first findings of bentonite was in the Cretaceous Benton Shale near Rock River, Wyoming. The Fort Benton Group, along with others in stratigraphic succession, was named after Fort Benton, Montana, in the mid-19th century by Fielding Bradford Meek and F. V. Hayden of the U.S. Geological Survey. Bentonite has since been found in many other locations, including China and Greece (bentonite deposit of the Milos volcanic island in the Aegean Sea). The total worldwide production of bentonite in 2018 was 20,400,000 metric tons.

==Types==
In geology, the term &quot;bentonite&quot; is applied to a type of claystone (a clay rock, not a clay mineral) composed mostly of montmorillonite (a clay mineral from the smectite group). It forms by devitrification of volcanic ash or tuff, typically in a marine environment. This results in a very soft, porous rock that may contain residual crystals of more resistant minerals, and which feels soapy or greasy to the touch. However, in commercial and industrial applications, the term &quot;bentonite&quot; is used more generally to refer to any swelling clay composed mostly of smectite clay minerals, which includes montmorillonite. The undifferentiated reference to the weathered volcanic rock for the geologist or to the industrial mixture of swelling clays can be a source of confusion.

The montmorillonite making up bentonite is an aluminium phyllosilicate mineral whose crystal structure is described as low-charge &quot;TOT&quot;. This means that a crystal of montmorillonite consists of layers, each of which is made up of two &quot;T&quot; sheets bonded to either side of an &quot;O&quot; sheet. The &quot;T&quot; sheets are so called because each aluminium or silicon ion in the sheet is surrounded by four oxygen ions arranged as a tetrahedron. The &quot;O&quot; sheets are so called because each aluminium ion is surrounded by six oxygen or hydroxyl ions arranged as an octahedron. The complete &quot;TOT&quot; layer has a weak negative electrical charge, and this is neutralized by calcium or sodium cations that bind adjacent layers together, with a distance between layers of about 1 nanometer. Because the negative charge is weak, only a fraction of the possible cation sites on the surface of a &quot;TOT&quot; layer actually contain calcium or sodium. Water molecules can easily infiltrate between sheets and fill the remaining sites. This accounts for the swelling property of montmorillonite and other smectite clay minerals.

The different types of bentonite are each named after the respective dominant cation. For industrial purposes, two main classes of bentonite are recognized: sodium and calcium bentonite. Sodium bentonite is the more valuable but calcium bentonite is more common. In stratigraphy and tephrochronology, completely devitrified (weathered volcanic glass) ash-fall beds are sometimes also referred to as &quot;K-bentonites&quot; (the illitized clay rock) when the dominant clay species is illite (a non-swelling clay). However, in pure clay mineralogy, the term illite is more appropriate than &quot;K-bentonite&quot; (the &quot;altered K-rock&quot;) because it is a distinct type of non-swelling clay while the commercial term bentonite implicitly refers to a swelling clay, a smectite (in the European and UK terminology), or a montmorillonite (in the US terminology).

===Sodium bentonite===
Sodium bentonite expands when wet, absorbing as much as several times its dry mass in water. Because of its excellent colloidal properties, it is often used in drilling mud for oil and gas wells and boreholes for geotechnical and environmental investigations. The property of swelling also makes sodium bentonite useful as a sealant, since it provides a self-sealing, low permeability barrier. It is used to line the base of landfills, for example. Bentonite is also part of the backfill material used at the nuclear Waste Isolation Pilot Project. Various surface modifications to sodium bentonite improve some rheological or sealing performance in geoenvironmental applications, for example, the addition of polymers.

Sodium bentonite can be combined with elemental sulfur as fertilizer prills. These permit slow oxidation of the sulfur to sulfate, a plant nutrient needed for some crops like onions or garlic synthesizing a lot of organo-sulfur compounds, and maintain sulfate levels in rainfall-leached soil longer than either pure powdered sulfur or gypsum. Sulfur/bentonite pads with added organic fertilizers have been used for organic farming.

===Calcium bentonite===
Calcium bentonite is a useful adsorbent of ions in solution, as well as fats and oils. It is the main active ingredient of fuller&#x27;s earth, probably one of the earliest industrial cleaning agents. It has significantly less swelling capacity than sodium bentonite.

Calcium bentonite may be converted to sodium bentonite (termed sodium beneficiation or sodium activation) to exhibit many of sodium bentonite&#x27;s properties by an ion exchange process. As commonly practiced, this means adding 5–10% of a soluble sodium salt such as sodium carbonate to wet bentonite, mixing well, and allowing time for the ion exchange to take place and water to remove the exchanged calcium. Some properties, such as viscosity and fluid loss of suspensions, of sodium-beneficiated calcium bentonite (or sodium-activated bentonite) may not be fully equivalent to those of natural sodium bentonite. For example, residual calcium carbonates (formed if exchanged cations are insufficiently removed) may result in inferior performance of the bentonite in geosynthetic liners.

===Illitisation of smectite clays by potassium ions and K-bentonite rock===
Illite is the main clay constituent of potash bentonite (a rock type also known as K-bentonite or potassium bentonite). K-bentonite is a term reserved to volcanic stratigraphy and tephrochronology and is related to the weathered clay rock type only. Illite, the clay mineral, is a potassium-rich phyllosilicate formed from the alteration of smectic clay in contact with groundwater rich in ions. Illite is a high-charge &quot;TOT&quot; clay mineral, in which negatively charged sheets are bound relatively strongly by more numerous potassium cations, and so it is no longer a swelling clay and has few industrial uses. In contrast to the highly hydrated ions which act as &quot;swellers&quot; or &quot;expanders&quot; ions, poorly hydrated ions behave as &quot;collapsers&quot; when exchanging with ions accessible in the interlayers space present between two &quot;TOT&quot; layers. Dehydrated ions are preferentially located in between two face-to-face hexagonal cavities formed by six joined silica tetrahedra present at the surface of the basal plane of a &quot;TOT&quot; layer (see the corresponding figure showing an elementary &quot;TOT&quot; layer). Because dehydrated, these ions are sometimes said to form inner-sphere bonds with the surrounding oxygen atoms present in the hexagonal cavity hosting them. It means there is no water molecule in between the ion and the oxygen atoms attached to the silica tetrahedra (T).

==Applications==

The main uses of bentonite are in drilling mud and as a binder, purifier, absorbent, and carrier for fertilizers or pesticides. As of around 1990, almost half of the US production of bentonite was used as drilling mud. Minor uses include filler, sealant, and catalyst in petroleum refining. Calcium bentonite is sometimes marketed as fuller&#x27;s earth, whose uses overlap with those of other forms of bentonite.

===Drilling mud===
Bentonite is used in drilling mud to lubricate and cool the cutting tools (drill bit), to remove cuttings, to stabilize the borehole walls, and to help prevent blowouts (by maintaining a sufficient hydraulic pressure in the well). Bentonite also curtails drilling fluid invasion by its propensity for aiding in the formation of mud cake. It plays an important role in the earth pressure balance and slurry shield variants of tunnel boring machines.

Much of bentonite&#x27;s usefulness in the drilling and geotechnical engineering industry comes from its unique rheological properties. Relatively small quantities of bentonite suspended in water form a viscous, shear-thinning material. Most often, bentonite suspensions are also thixotropic, although rare cases of rheopectic behavior have also been reported. At high enough concentrations (about 60 grams of bentonite per litre of suspension, ~6wt.%), bentonite suspensions begin to take on the characteristics of a gel (a fluid with a minimum yield strength required to make it move).

===Binder===
Bentonite has been widely used as a foundry-sand bond in iron and steel foundries. Sodium bentonite is most commonly used for large castings that use dry molds, while calcium bentonite is more commonly used for smaller castings that use &quot;green&quot; or wet molds. Bentonite is also used as a binding agent in the manufacture of iron ore (taconite) pellets as used in the steelmaking industry. Bentonite, in small percentages, is used as an ingredient in commercial and homemade clay bodies and ceramic glazes. It greatly increases the plasticity of clay bodies and decreases settling in glazes, making both easier to work with for most applications.

The ionic surface of bentonite has a useful property in making a sticky coating on sand grains. When a small proportion of finely ground bentonite clay is added to hard sand and wetted, the clay binds the sand particles into a moldable aggregate known as green sand used for making molds in sand casting. 

The self-stickiness of bentonite allows high-pressure ramming or pressing of the clay in molds to produce hard, refractory shapes, such as model rocket nozzles.
===Purification===
Bentonites are used for decolorizing various mineral, vegetable, and animal oils. They are also used for clarifying wine, liquor, cider, beer, mead, and vinegar.

Bentonite has the property of adsorbing relatively large amounts of protein molecules from aqueous solutions. Consequently, bentonite is uniquely useful in the process of winemaking, where it is used to remove excessive amounts of protein from white wines. Were it not for this use of bentonite, many or most white wines would precipitate undesirable flocculent clouds or hazes upon exposure to warm temperatures, as these proteins denature. It also has the incidental use of inducing more rapid clarification of both red and white wines.

Bentonite is also considered an effective low-cost adsorbent for the removal of chromium(VI) ions from aqueous solutions (contaminated wastewater).

===Absorbent===

Bentonite is used in a variety of pet care items such as cat litter to absorb pet waste. It is also used to absorb oils and grease.

===Carrier===
Bentonite is used as an inert carrier for pesticides, fertilizers, and fire retardants. It helps ensure that the active agent is uniformly dispersed and that pesticides and fertilizers are retained on the plants.

===Filler===
Bentonite is used as a filler in a wide variety of products, including adhesives, cosmetics, paint, rubber, some greases, and soaps. It also acts as a stabilizer and extender in these products.

===Sealant===
The property of swelling on contact with water makes sodium bentonite useful as a sealant since it provides a self-sealing, low-permeability barrier. It is used to line the base of landfills to prevent migration of leachate, for confining metal pollutants of groundwater, and for the sealing of subsurface disposal systems for spent nuclear fuel. Similar uses include making slurry walls, waterproofing of below-grade walls, and forming other impermeable barriers, e.g., to seal off the annulus of a water well, to plug old wells.

Bentonite can also be &quot;sandwiched&quot; between synthetic materials to create geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) for the aforementioned purposes. This technique allows for more convenient transport and installation, and it greatly reduces the volume of bentonite required. It is also used to form barriers around newly planted trees to constrain the growth of its roots: in order to prevent damage to any of the nearby footpaths, parking lots, playgrounds, etc; or any of the surrounding underground infrastructures like the pipes, drainage systems, sewers, etc. Farmers use bentonite to seal retention ponds and line canals.

===Catalyst===
High-purity calcium bentonite is treated with acid for use as a catalyst in cracking heavy petroleum fractions.

===Medicine===
Bentonite has been prescribed as a bulk laxative, and it is also used as a base for many dermatologic formulas. Granular bentonite is being studied for use in battlefield wound dressings. Bentonite is also sold online and in retail outlets for a variety of indications.

Bentoquatam is a bentonate-based topical medication intended to act as a shield against exposure to urushiol, the oil found in plants such as poison ivy or poison oak.

Bentonite can also be used as a desiccant due to its adsorption properties. Bentonite desiccants have been successfully used to protect pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and diagnostic products from moisture degradation and extend shelf life. In most common package environments, bentonite desiccants offer a higher water adsorption capacity than silica gel desiccants. Bentonite complies with the FDA for contact with food and drugs.

===Farming in Thailand===
The application of clay technology by farmers in northeast Thailand, using bentonite clay, has dramatically reversed soil degradation and resulted in greater economic returns, with higher yields and higher output prices. Studies carried out by The International Water Management Institute and partners in 2002–2003 focused on the application of locally sourced bentonite clays to degraded soils in the region. These applications were carried out in structured field trials. Applying bentonite clays effectively improved yields of forage sorghum grown under rain-fed conditions.

Bentonite application also influenced the prices that farmers received for their crops. Production costs are higher, but due to higher production and the quality of the food, clay farmers could afford to invest and grow more and better food, compared to nonclay-using farmers.

===Bentonite slurry walls in modern construction===
Bentonite slurry walls (also known as diaphragm walls

) are used in construction, where the slurry wall is a trench filled with a thick colloidal mixture of bentonite and water.
A trench that would collapse due to the hydraulic pressure in the surrounding soil does not collapse as the slurry balances the hydraulic pressure. Forms for concrete, and rebar, can be assembled in a slurry-filled trench, and then have concrete poured into the form. The liquid concrete being denser displaces the less-dense bentonite slurry and causes the latter to overflow from the trench. This displaced bentonite slurry is then channeled to a recycling unit from which it can subsequently be reused in a new trench elsewhere on the construction site.

In addition, because the colloid is relatively impervious to water, a slurry wall can prevent the seepage of groundwater, which is useful in preventing the further spread of groundwater that has been contaminated by toxic material such as industrial waste.

===Ceramics===
Plasticity is the property of clay that allows it to be manipulated and retain its shape without cracking after the shaping force has been removed; clays with low plasticity are known as &quot;short&quot; or &quot;non-plastic&quot;. A small amount of bentonite added to clay can increase its plasticity, and hence ease forming of articles by some shaping techniques. However, bentonite typically contains minerals that affect the fired color of the mix, and its swelling properties can make such a mix prone to significant shrinkage and potential cracking as it dries.

Ceramic glazes often contain bentonite. The bentonite is added to slow or prevent the settling of the glazes. It can also improve the consistency of application of glazes on porous biscuit-fired ware. Once a certain amount of glaze water has been absorbed by the biscuit the bentonite effectively clogs the pores and resists the absorption of further water resulting in a more evenly thick coat.

===Emergency response===
Bentonite is used in industry and emergency response as a chemical absorbent and container sealant.

==History and natural occurrence==

In 2018, China was the top producer of bentonite, with almost a one-quarter share of the world&#x27;s production, followed by the United States and India. Total worldwide production was 24,400,000 metric tons of bentonite and 3,400,000 metric tons of fuller&#x27;s earth.

Most high-grade natural sodium bentonite is produced from the western United States in an area between the Black Hills of South Dakota and the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming, and the Tokat Resadiye region of Turkey. Mixed sodium/calcium bentonite is mined in Greece, Pakistan, Australia, India, Russia, and Ukraine.

In the United States, calcium bentonite is mined primarily in Mississippi and Alabama. Other major locations producing calcium bentonite include New Zealand, Germany, Greece, Turkey, India, and China.

<text>The Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, later Grumman Aerospace Corporation, was a 20th century American producer of military and civilian aircraft. Founded on December 6, 1929, by Leroy Grumman and his business partners, it merged in 1994 with Northrop Corporation to form Northrop Grumman.

==History==
Leroy Grumman worked for the Loening Aircraft Engineering Corporation beginning in 1920. In 1929, Keystone Aircraft Corporation bought Loening Aircraft and moved its operations from New York City to Bristol, Pennsylvania. Grumman and three other ex-Loening Aircraft employees, (Edmund Ward Poor, William Schwendler, and Jake Swirbul) started their own company in an old Cox-Klemin Aircraft Co. factory in Baldwin on Long Island, New York. 

The company registered as a business on December 6, 1929, and officially opened on January 2, 1930. While maintaining the business by welding aluminum tubing for truck frames, the company eagerly pursued contracts with the US Navy. Grumman designed the first practical floats with a retractable landing gear for the Navy, and this launched Grumman into the aviation market. The first Grumman aircraft was also for the Navy, the Grumman FF-1, a biplane with retractable landing gear developed at Curtiss Field in 1931. This was followed by a number of other successful designs.

During World War II, Grumman became known for its &quot;Cats&quot; (Navy fighter aircraft): the F4F Wildcat and F6F Hellcat, the Grumman F7F Tigercat and Grumman F8F Bearcat, and also for its torpedo bomber, the Grumman TBF Avenger. Grumman ranked 22nd among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. Production of the majority of the Wildcats and Avenger was subcontracted to a purposely established division of General Motors : the Eastern Aircraft Division. Grumman&#x27;s first jet aircraft was the F9F Panther; it was followed by the upgraded F9F/F-9 Cougar, and the F-11 Tiger in the 1950s. The company&#x27;s big postwar successes came in the 1960s with the A-6 Intruder and E-2 Hawkeye and in the 1970s with the Grumman EA-6B Prowler and F-14 Tomcat. Grumman products were prominent in several feature movies including &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; in 1980, &quot;Top Gun&quot; in 1986, and &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot; in 1990. The U.S. Navy still employs the Hawkeye as part of Carrier Air Wings on board aircraft carriers, while the U.S. Marine Corps, the last branch of service to fly the Prowler, retired it on March 8, 2019.

Grumman was the chief contractor on the Apollo Lunar Module, the first spacecraft to land humans on the Moon. The firm received the contract on November 7, 1962, and built 13 lunar modules. Six of them successfully landed on the Moon, with one serving as a lifeboat on Apollo 13, after an explosion crippled the main Apollo spacecraft. LM-2, a test article which never flew in space, is displayed permanently in the Smithsonian Institution. As the Apollo program neared its end, Grumman was one of the main competitors for the contract to design and build the Space Shuttle, but lost to Rockwell International.

In 1969, the company changed its name to Grumman Aerospace Corporation, and in 1978 it sold the Grumman-American Division to Gulfstream Aerospace. That same year, it acquired the bus manufacturer Flxible. The company built the Grumman LLV (Long Life Vehicle), a light transport mail truck designed for and used by the United States Postal Service. The LLV was produced from 1987 until 1994. Its intended service life was 24 years, but some of them were still in service in 2020. In 1983, Grumman sold Flxible for $40 million to General Automotive Corporation of Ann Arbor.

In the 1950s, Grumman began production of Gulfstream business aircraft, starting with the Gulfstream I turboprop (Grumman model G-159) and the Gulfstream II jet (Grumman model G-1159). Gulfstream aircraft were operated by many companies, private individuals, and government agencies including various military entities and NASA. In addition, the Gulfstream I was operated by several regional airlines in scheduled passenger services. The Gulfstream I-C (Grumman model G-159C) version was &quot;stretched&quot; to carry 37 passengers.

In the early 1970s, Grumman acquired majority interest in the American Aviation line of very light aircraft -- relabeling its planes as &quot;Grumman-American&quot; or &quot;Grumman American&quot; -- eventually joining it with their Gulfstream division before selling off that combined enterprise in 1978.

In 1978, Grumman sold Gulfstream to American Jet Industries, which adopted the Gulfstream name. Since 1999, Gulfstream has been a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics.

==Long Island locations==

For much of the Cold War period, Grumman was the largest corporate employer on Long Island. Grumman&#x27;s products were considered so reliable and ruggedly built that the company was often referred to as the &quot;Grumman Iron Works&quot;.

As the company grew, it moved to Valley Stream, New York, then Farmingdale, New York, finally to its facility in Bethpage, New York, with the testing and final assembly at the Naval Weapons Station in Calverton, New York, all located on Long Island. At its peak in 1986 it employed 23,000 people on Long Island and occupied in structures on it leased from the U.S. Navy in Bethpage.

The end of the Cold War at the beginning of the 1990s reduced defense spending and led to a wave of mergers as aerospace companies shrank in number; in 1994 Northrop bought Grumman for $2.1 billion to form Northrop Grumman, after Northrop topped a $1.9 billion offer from Martin Marietta.

The new company closed almost all of its facilities on Long Island and converted the Bethpage plant to a residential and office complex, with its headquarters becoming the corporate headquarters for Cablevision and the Calverton plant being turned into a business/industrial complex. Former aircraft hangars have become Grumman Studios, a film and television production center. A portion of the airport property has been used for the Grumman Memorial Park.

===Other products===
* Grumman manufactured fire engines under the name Firecat (not to be confused with the firefighting variant of the Grumman S-2 Tracker, which is sold under the same name) and aerial tower trucks under the Aerialcat name. The company entered the fire apparatus business in 1976 with its purchase of Howe Fire Apparatus.
* Grumman canoes were developed in 1944 as World War II was winding down. Company executive William Hoffman used the company&#x27;s aircraft aluminum to replace the traditional wood design. The canoes had a reputation for being sturdier, lighter and stronger than their wood counterparts and had a considerable market share. Grumman moved its boat making division to Marathon, New York in 1952.
: Outboard Marine Corp. bought the division in 1990 and produced the last Grumman-brand canoe in 1996. Shortly thereafter former Grumman executives formed the Marathon Boat Group to produce the canoes. In 2000 the Group worked out an agreement with Northrop Grumman to sell the canoes using Grumman name and logo.
* Grumman sport boat
* Grumman-Flxible 870 transit buses (1978–1982)
* Ben Franklin (PX-15), a science submarine
* Grumman LLV postal vehicle widely used by the United States Postal Service and Canada Post
* In honor of Grumman&#x27;s aviation and aerospace inventions, a Grumman Memorial Park was established in Calverton, New York.

<doc id="216800" wikidata="Q1306651" url="?curid=216800" title="Jean-Paul Mousseau">
<text>Jean-Paul Mousseau (January 1, 1927 – February 7, 1991) was a Quebec artist. He was a student of Paul-Émile Borduas, a member of the Automatist group and a founding member of the Association of Non-Figurative Artists of Montreal. 

==Career==
Jean-Paul Mousseau was born in Montreal and studied painting there at the College Notre-Dame at the age of thirteen, Interior Decoration at the École du Meuble (1945-1946); and painting with Paul-Émile Borduas (1946-1951). He first exhibited his work in 1944, after joining the Contemporary Art Society and as a member of the Automatistes, in the first Automatist exhibition in 1946. In 1948, he was one of the signatories of the Refus global manifesto. In 1953 he was an exhibitor in &quot;Les Automatistes&quot; at the Place des Arts, Montreal, and in 1955 his painting &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; won first prize in the Winnipeg Art Show (it was one of two first prizes). By 1955, Mousseau was exhibiting work similar in aims to Les Plasticiens, a group of artists who had broken away from Les Automatistes to achieve effects through tone, texture, form and line in highly ordered paintings characteristic of the de Stijl group. He exhibited this work in &quot;Espace 55&quot; at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 1955. In 1956, he was one of the founders of the Non-Figurative Artists Association of Montreal. In 1957, he began exploring new materials such as coloured resin and fibreglass.

At the end of the 1950s, he was one of the first Quebec artists who saw the necessity of integrating art into the urban environment. His most important contributions are his numerous murals and other collaborations with architects, such as his mural (&quot;Lumière et mouvement&quot;) in the Hydro-Québec building in Montreal for which he won first prize in a competition in 1961. He also designed discotheques. In 1963, 1967 and again in 1997, retrospectives of his work were held (in 1997 curated by Pierre Landry for the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal with an extensive chronology). He participated in many group shows nationally and internationally including the First Biennial of Canadian Painting (1955); the exhibition of Canadian art at the Canadian Pavilion, Brussels International Exposition, Belgium (1958); as a guest exhibitor of Painters 11 (1958), and in many others. He also designed costumes, posters, scenery and lighting for many important productions of the theatre. His work is included in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; and the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain, among others.

Mousseau died of cancer in 1991.

==Montreal metro==

Jean-Paul Mousseau did artwork in the Montreal metro. He clashed with the metro&#x27;s first art director, Robert Lapalme, who insisted that art for the metro be figurative, represent Montreal history, and be sponsored. Mousseau wished to open the doors to non-figurative art integrated into the architecture and accounted for in the construction budget. Lapalme held sway over the initial network, except for two works (Mousseau&#x27;s &quot;Circles&quot; at Peel station and Marcelle Ferron&#x27;s stained glass at Champ-de-Mars).

Mousseau took over as art director after LaPalme, and his influence marked the rest of the network. Most of the artwork was planned in accordance with the architects, and many were by the architects themselves. Works by Mousseau in the metro include the mural &quot;Opus 74&quot; at Viau station, two murals at Honoré-Beaugrand, and a mural at Square-Victoria. He also created some sculptural lighting elements in the concert-hall of the Orford Arts Centre, in collaboration with the designer Léonard Garneau, who was in charge of the interior design of the centre. His work is integral to Montreal&#x27;s airport and several of its skyscrapers.

<text>Spitting Image is a British satirical television puppet show, created by Peter Fluck, Roger Law and Martin Lambie-Nairn. First broadcast in 1984, the series was produced by &#x27;Spitting Image Productions&#x27; for Central Independent Television over 18 series which aired on the ITV network. The series was nominated and won numerous awards, including ten BAFTA Television Awards, and two Emmy Awards in 1985 and 1986 in the Popular Arts Category. The series features puppet caricatures of contemporary celebrities and public figures, including British Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major and the British royal family. The series was the first to caricature Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (as an elderly gin-drinker with a Beryl Reid voice).

One of the most-watched shows of the 1980s, &quot;Spitting Image&quot; satirised politics, entertainment, sport and British popular culture of the era. At its peak, the show was watched by 15 million people. The popularity of the show saw collaborations with musicians, including Phil Collins and Sting. The series was cancelled in 1996 after viewing figures declined. ITV had plans for a new series in 2006, but these were scrapped after a dispute over the Ant &amp; Dec puppets used to host &quot;Best Ever Spitting Image&quot;, which were created against Roger Law&#x27;s wishes. In 2018, Law donated his entire archive – including scripts, puppet moulds, drawings and recordings – to the University of Cambridge. In 2019, Law announced the show would be returning with a new series. The revived series debuted on 3 October 2020 on BritBox, and featured caricatures of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. It was cancelled in 2022.

==History==
Martin Lambie-Nairn proposed a satirical television show with caricature puppets created by Peter Fluck and Roger Law. Fluck and Law, who had both attended the Cambridge School of Art, had no previous television experience, but had, for several years, constructed plasticine caricatures to illustrate articles in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; magazine. The idea for the series was rejected by many in the industry, who thought it would only be suitable for children, but the series was finally accepted for development and first broadcast in 1984.

English comedy writer and &quot;National Lampoon&quot; editor Tony Hendra was brought in as a writer; Fluck and Law had met him while they were working in the US. Hendra brought in John Lloyd, producer of &quot;Not The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. They were joined by Jon Blair, a documentary producer. They then hired Muppet puppeteer Louise Gold. Development was funded by the entrepreneur Clive Sinclair.

The puppets, based on public figures, were designed by Fluck and Law, assisted by caricaturists including David Stoten, Pablo Bach, Steve Bendelack and Tim Watts. The episodes included musical parodies by Philip Pope (former member of &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; and The Hee Bee Gee Bees) and later Steve Brown.

In 1984, the first episode of &quot;Spitting Image&quot; was aired with a laugh track, apparently at the insistence of Central Television. This episode was shown to a preview audience before transmission. In the early years of the show, &quot;Spitting Image&quot; was filmed and based in the enterprise zone at London Docklands at the Limehouse Studios, where scriptwriters convened and puppets were manufactured. Impressionist Steve Nallon recalls that &quot;they were able to get away with no health and safety, so all of the building of the puppets with all the toxic waste from the foam was just in a warehouse. There were no extractor fans; it was quite Dickensian.&quot; In later series, &quot;Spitting Image&quot; was recorded at Central&#x27;s studios in Nottingham with last minute additions being recorded at the Limehouse Studios at Canary Wharf, London.

==Reception==
Before the first episode was broadcast, the parodies of the Royal Family were cut as a courtesy to the Duke of Edinburgh, who opened the East Midlands Television Centre a few days later. The scenes were all reinstated in later episodes. Stephen Fry has written that Diana, Princess of Wales told him around 1991 that &quot;&quot;They&quot; hate it of course. I absolutely adore it.&quot; Avalon Television executive producer Jon Thoday stated that Ronald Reagan directly contacted NBC asking for the show to be cancelled.

The first episode had an audience of 7.9 million, but numbers rapidly dropped, which meant economies had to be introduced since the series cost £2.6 million to make, nearly double the price of other prime time series.

The series had been originally scheduled to have 13 episodes, but was cut to 12 after the series was nearly cancelled. Rob Grant and Doug Naylor were then brought in as head writers to save the show; by 1986, under their supervision, &quot;Spitting Image&quot; had become popular, producing a number one song on the UK Singles Chart (&quot;The Chicken Song&quot;). However, Grant and Naylor subsequently left to create &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; for BBC2. &quot;Spitting Image&quot; had a short-running dispute with the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) in 1985, over the use of subliminal images.

===Evolution===

When Margaret Thatcher resigned as both Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party in November 1990, her successor was Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major. This marked a shift in the tone of the show, with the writers moving from the Punch and Judy style to more subtle and atmospheric sketches, notably a series in which an awkward Major and wife Norma ate peas for dinner. The producers dressed Major, skin and all, in shades of grey, and invented an affair between him and Virginia Bottomley.

The show added animated sketches from 1989 and again from 1994 (with short, animated segments before 1989). For the 1992 Election Special, a studio audience was used; this format was revisited for two episodes in late 1993. A spoof &quot;Question Time&quot; took questions from the audience. The 1992 show was fronted by a puppet Robin Day, a puppet Jeremy Paxman filling the role in the episodes broadcast on 14 November 1993 and 12 December 1993.

==Characters==
===Politicians===

Many British politicians in parliament during Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s tenure were parodied. By far the most prominent was Thatcher herself, portrayed as an abusive, tyrannical, cigar-chomping cross-dresser (she wore suits, shaved, used the urinals, and was addressed by her Cabinet as &quot;Sir&quot;).

In the first series, Thatcher sought advice from her enraptured neighbour Herr Jeremy Von Wilcox (who is actually an elderly Adolf Hitler, living at 9 Downing Street) about the unions and the unemployed. In the third episode, Mr. Wilcox/Hitler compares the trade unions with the Soviet Union and advises not to attack in winter. In that same episode, regarding unemployment, he says that people out of work should be put in the army, and tells Thatcher that he thinks the SS (meaning SAS) are a &quot;great bunch of guys&quot;.

Alongside Thatcher were her Cabinet, which included:

*Willie Whitelaw, with fluffy eyebrows and wearing a tartan dressing gown to cabinet meetings.
*Nigel Lawson, panicking about a financial crisis he had apparently caused (a real-life recession caused Lawson to step down in 1989). He is by far the worst of all the cabinet being unable to count to 17; he also writes new budget and tax laws in his favour. However, upon discovering Thatcher promptly has him rewrite them in her favour.
*Geoffrey Howe, boring, bland and talks to sheep.
*Douglas Hurd, famous for his Dalek-style voice and his hair shaped like a &quot;Mr Whippy&quot; ice cream. Hurd seems also the most competent and humane one in the cabinet, opposing the usage of torture and stopping the dumping of nuclear waste in Scotland.
*Norman Tebbit, appearing as a leather-clad skinhead loyal to Thatcher, referring to her as &quot;Leader&quot; and often beating up other politicians.
*Michael Heseltine, growing more manic with every series (and wearing a flak jacket as Defence Secretary).
*Leon Brittan, constantly fawning towards Thatcher and often seen eating.
*Norman Fowler, portrayed during his time as Health Secretary as a hospital-murdering Jack the Ripper-style lunatic.
*Cecil Parkinson, having a playboy attitude
*Edwina Currie, portrayed as a vampire or Cruella de Vil.
*Paul Channon, childish.
*Kenneth Baker, transforming into a slug over the series.
*Nicholas Ridley, smoking and developing the countryside for houses.
*Kenneth Clarke, obese and drunk despite being Minister for Health.
*Peter Walker, as a spineless wimp.
*David Waddington, fast talking and creepy.
*Francis Pym and Jim Prior, Wets who swam in swimming pools.
*Colin Moynihan, minuscule and childlike, called &quot;miniature for sport&quot;.
*Tom King, portrayed while Employment Secretary as The Invisible Man.

Thatcher&#x27;s Cabinet were often depicted as bickering schoolchildren, with Thatcher acting as teacher. In one skit she treats her Cabinet to a meal at a restaurant. The waitress asks: &quot;Would you like to order, sir?&quot; Thatcher responds: &quot;Yes. I will have the steak&quot; Waitress: &quot;And what about the Vegetables?&quot; Thatcher: &quot;Oh, they&#x27;ll [The Cabinet] have the same as me&quot;.

Thatcher&#x27;s successor John Major was portrayed as a dull, boring grey character who enjoyed a meal of peas with his wife Norma and was constantly mocked by Humphrey, the Downing Street cat. Before Thatcher&#x27;s resignation, Major had been portrayed as wearing a leopard print suit and swinging in on a trapeze, referencing his background as the son of a circus acrobat (which he would frequently remind everyone about). Upon his appointment to Prime Minister, Major was initially portrayed as a robot with a spinning antenna on his head (it was explained in a sketch that Thatcher used it to control Major, standing behind Thatcher in the crowd of sycophantic cabinet members, eager to repeat whatever the Thatcher puppet screeched).

The Opposition (Labour Party) politicians included:

*Neil Kinnock, the &#x27;Welsh Windbag&#x27;, talking for hours about anything other than policies.
*Roy Hattersley, spitting with every word because of his lisp (on &#x27;Best Ever Spitting Image&#x27;, Hattersley praised his puppet for &#x27;putting the spit into &quot;Spitting Image&quot;&#x27;).
*Michael Foot, aged and senile, ending sentences with &quot;Yes! Argh!&quot;.
*Tony Benn, a rampant socialist with eyes that never looked in the same direction.
*Ken Livingstone, whose living room was filled with salamanders and snakes.
*Denis Healey, with giant eyebrows, who helped to make Kinnock look foolish (the real Healey appeared in the programme in 1984 in a skit about that year&#x27;s European elections in the UK).
*Gerald Kaufman, portrayed as a Hannibal Lecter-style maniac.

Arthur Scargill, who was a member of the Labour Party until 1997, appeared as head of the National Union of Mineworkers, and was portrayed as a big-nosed egotist who was ignorant about mining.

In 1994, a puppet of Tony Blair made his appearance. He was originally a public school boy, wearing grey shorts, blazer and cap. His catchphrase was &quot;I&#x27;M THE LEADER&quot; in reference to his attempt to lead the Labour Party. When Blair did become Labour leader, the puppet changed and he was portrayed with his grin replaced with an even bigger smile if he said something of importance. The deputy leader, John Prescott, was portrayed as a fat bumbling assistant, along with a squeaky voiced Robin Cook, and an enormous bespectacled Jack Straw.

The SDP–Liberal Alliance was portrayed by the election-losing, populist, arrogant and undecided David Owen, with whining, bedwetting David Steel in his pocket. They were soon replaced by Paddy Ashdown, whose &quot;equidistance&quot; from the larger parties was satirised by his frequent appearance at the side of the screen during unrelated sketches, saying: &quot;I am neither in this sketch nor not in it, but somewhere in-between&quot;. This running gag was used when Ashdown&#x27;s extramarital affair was revealed, and his puppet commented that &quot;I didn&#x27;t touch her on the left leg, or the right leg, but somewhere in-between.&quot; Former Liberal MP Cyril Smith also made a few appearances as a morbidly obese giant.

In the first series, Former Prime Ministers Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home were depicted as living in a highly restrictive retirement home named Exchequers, where they were frequently abused by Queen Victoria. Wilson constantly attempted escape, whilst Callaghan took delight in tormenting him. Edward Heath was also said to have resided there, but he was not seen on screen; later, he would appear as a naked piano player.

===Royal Family===
The main characters were:
*Elizabeth II: wore a CND badge, always seemed slightly mad and picked clothes from rubbish bins.
*Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was a blunderbuss-toting Greek-obsessed buffoon in naval uniform.
*Charles, Prince of Wales was a pseudo-hippie, then a taxi driver in later episodes.
*Diana, Princess of Wales was a publicity-hungry Sloane Ranger.
*Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who was generally seen with a bottle of Gordon&#x27;s Gin, a copy of the &quot;Racing Post&quot;, and a Beryl Reid voice; this was a running joke from a sketch in which the Royal Family&#x27;s desire to conceal her Birmingham accent was the reason she was seldom heard speaking on television. In the series she is seen with jockey Lester Piggott with whom she has an affair.

Other members who were parodied include nymphomaniac Prince Andrew, envious and heavily freckled Sarah, Duchess of York, grumpy Princess Anne, poorly informed Prince Edward, Panzer-driving Princess Michael of Kent, and always-tipsy Princess Margaret.

===International politicians===
&quot;Spitting Image&quot; lampooned US President Ronald Reagan as a bumbling, nuke-obsessed fool in comparison with his advisors Edwin Meese and Caspar Weinberger. Next to his bed were red buttons labelled &#x27;Nuke&#x27; and &#x27;Nurse&#x27;. His wife Nancy was the butt of cosmetic surgery jokes.

Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s forehead birthmark was shaped like a hammer and sickle. All other Russians looked like Leonid Brezhnev, often said &quot;da&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;) and talked about potatoes. In Russia it was snowing even indoors and the Soviet television had extremely low-tech visual effects.

Yitzhak Shamir often appeared wearing a hard hat with the Star of David on it, holding a brick and referring to building a &quot;legitimate Israeli settlement&quot; (referring to the practice of building houses on the occupied West Bank for Israeli people).

François Mitterrand was wearing a beret and a garlic wreath, his successor Jacques Chirac was depicted as being obsessed and callous with nuclear weapons. P. W. Botha was shown as a racist cleverly disguising his views (once he had a badge &quot;anti-anti-apartheid&quot;). Some appearances were also made by Idi Amin, Robert Mugabe, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, Ruhollah Khomeini, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. Khomeini appear to parody Iranian law and policy.

Khomeini and Botha along with the more recurring Reagan, Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, and Gorbachev appear in the Spitting Image video game.

Other international caricatures included Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger; George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle; Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, Konstantin Chernenko, Raisa Gorbachova and Boris Yeltsin.

===Sport===

England manager Bobby Robson was a senile worrier nicknamed &#x27;Rubbisho&#x27;. Emlyn Hughes was portrayed with a high pitched and annoying voice. England midfielder Paul Gascoigne appeared, frequently crying – a parody of the 1990 World Cup semi-final against West Germany, in which he famously cried after being booked, which would have ruled him out of the final had England won the game.

Ian Botham was a violent drug addict, while Mike Gatting spoke with a high voice. Lester Piggott had to be subtitled. Boxing characters included Frank Bruno with his trademark laugh and catchphrase &quot;where&#x27;s &#x27;Arry?&quot;, and Chris Eubank, with his lisp. Snooker player Steve Davis was boring, upset because he had no nickname, but thought himself interesting.

===Celebrities===
News reporters were also depicted: Alastair Burnet was sycophantic towards the Royal Family and with a nose that inflated; Sandy Gall was effeminate, always worrying what coat he would wear; John Cole was incomprehensible and had to be dragged off-screen when he talked for too long; Nicholas Witchell was always turning up during a strike to work rather than report; Kate Adie was a thrill-seeker, and BBC Head of Bravery. Presenters were also seen: Jeremy Paxman appeared as uninterested and self-loving, and Trevor McDonald frequently lamented his lot after being paired with Ronnie Corbett as newscasters, with the latter always getting the punchlines. William Rees-Mogg was portrayed as a censorship-crazy person with eyes that would frequently pop out of the socket.

David Coleman had a very loud ear prompter and sometimes did not know what he was commentating on; Frank Bough was portrayed as being a drug user; Bruce Forsyth spoke every sentence as though it was a catchphrase. Celebrity chef Keith Floyd was always getting drunk on wine, while film critic Barry Norman was not a fan of his puppet, because it had an inexplicable wart on its forehead, which he did not have. Paul Daniels did not mind jokes about his toupée, but took offence to a sketch depicting him nuzzling his assistant Debbie McGee&#x27;s breasts.

Comedians were satirised: Billy Connolly was portrayed as a jester; Jimmy Tarbuck was said to use old jokes and always take part in the Royal Variety Performance; Bernard Manning was an obese racist; and Ben Elton was always shown with a microphone.

Writer and MP Jeffrey Archer appeared as an annoying, self-commenting writer whose books were not read by anyone. Kenneth Williams was depicted with a large nose and big teeth, and Harry Secombe was depicted as overly religious. Alan Bennett was shown at home as watching &quot;Spitting Image&quot; on TV. Esther Rantzen always had a permanent grin and was frequently carrying an onion (reflecting a concurrent running joke in &quot;Private Eye&quot; suggesting insincere theatrical tears), whilst Cilla Black had large teeth and a thick Scouse accent.

===Musicians===
A Mick Jagger character seemed perpetually high, and Keith Richards so old and haggard that he thought he was dead. Ringo Starr was a drunkard, and Paul McCartney was always releasing albums and films that flopped. Madonna changed her hair and clothes with every episode, and Michael Jackson&#x27;s skin turned lighter. Kylie Minogue was depicted as a vain robot; Luciano Pavarotti was hugely overweight and ate everything he saw; Matt and Luke Goss of the band Bros were depicted as children wanting to grow up.

===Actors===

Actor Dustin Hoffman spoke nasally and was parodied for his method acting; John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier lamented their friends, and even their own death. James Bond actor Roger Moore was depicted &quot;with a wooden delivery&quot; – only his eyebrows moved; Moore quipped, &quot;My acting range has always been something between the two extremes of &#x27;raises left eyebrow&#x27; and &#x27;raises right eyebrow&#x27;.&quot; Arnold Schwarzenegger was muscle-bound but insecure about the size of his genitals; Donald Sinden was parodied as also trying to become the greatest Shakespearian actor and get a knighthood. Clint Eastwood was frequently portrayed as an uncompromising tough guy, and Sylvester Stallone nearly always appeared dressed up as John Rambo.

===Religious figures===
Archbishop Robert Runcie, Mary Whitehouse and Cliff Richard were portrayed as Christian censors. Ian Paisley was always shouting and dressed in black. Bishop David Jenkins was depicted as not believing in anything. Pope John Paul II was a banjo-playing womaniser who spoke with a hip urban African-American accent.

===Others===
Media moguls Robert Maxwell and Rupert Murdoch were also on the show, the latter depicted as an extremely flatulent individual encouraging obscenity in his mass media.

Lord Lucan appeared in various background roles often as a bartender.

==Songs==
The first single from &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, released in 1984, was a rework of the Crystals&#x27; &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;. The &quot;Spitting Image&quot; version, &quot;Da Do Run Ron&quot;, was a spoof election campaign song for Ronald Reagan, featuring Nancy Reagan listing reasons to elect her husband. The cover of the single featured Reagan as a biker with Nancy riding pillion.

The B-side of this single was titled &quot;Just A Prince Who Can&#x27;t Say No&quot; and poked fun at the sexual indiscretions of Prince Andrew. The TV version of this song (featured in the second episode) was heavily censored by Central Television on broadcast but presented uncut on vinyl. In the television series he was shown surrounded by various famous women including Joan Collins, Mary Whitehouse and Linda McCartney.

In 1986, the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; puppets released &quot;The Chicken Song&quot;, a parody of &quot;Agadoo&quot; by Black Lace – one of several parodies to have featured in the programme, mimicking novelty records and holiday songs with a repetitive tunes and nonsensical lyrics. Ironically, The Chicken Song hit number 1 in the UK Singles Chart for 3 weeks from 17 May 1986 – 3 June 1986. VH1 US named it as one of the worst number 1 nominations.

The other songs released by &quot;Spitting Image&quot; were &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Met a Nice South African&quot; (which was on the B-Side of &quot;The Chicken Song&quot; and was a savage indictment of the apartheid-ridden country), &quot;We&#x27;re Scared Of Bob&quot; (a parody of &quot;We Are The World&quot;) and &quot;Hello You Must Be Going&quot; (which mocked Phil Collins&#x27;s divorce ballads and was on the 12&quot; release of The Chicken Song), &quot;Santa Claus Is on the Dole&quot; (backed with &quot;The Atheist Tabernacle Choir&quot;), &quot;The Christmas Singles&quot; and &quot;Cry Gazza Cry&quot; (based on footballer Paul Gascoigne&#x27;s tears in the 1990 World Cup).

&quot;The Chicken Song&quot; was by far the most successful of all of their music and not-so-subtle references were made to it in subsequent sketches in the show itself. In 1986, a compilation LP &quot;Spit In Your Ear&quot; was produced, featuring some of their sketches over time along with a few of their songs, followed in 1990 by &quot;20 Great Golden Gobs&quot;, a songs-only collection from the 1986–1990 series.

In 1986, the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; team experienced some real musical success when they created the video for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; by Genesis, a song which implied that Thatcher and Reagan were about to bring the world to a nuclear war. Phil Collins saw a disfigured version of himself on the show and contacted the show&#x27;s producers with the idea to produce the video. Three new puppets were created depicting all members of Genesis (including a less exaggerated version of Collins), which also appear on the sleeve of the 45 (and later CD) single. The video was depicted as a nightmare Reagan was having, which left him completely immersed in sweat from worrying. It won a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video in 1987.

The end of the 1987 election featured a young boy, dressed as a city banker, singing &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot;, a parody of the film &quot;Cabaret&quot;, when a member of the Hitler Youth starts singing the same song. In a series 5 episode, Labour leader Neil Kinnock is portrayed singing a self-parody to the tune &quot;My eyes are fully open&quot; from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, supported by members of his shadow cabinet.

In one instance Sting was persuaded to sing a re-worded version of &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, titled &quot;Every Bomb You Make&quot; (series 1, episode 12), to accompany a video showing the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; puppets of world leaders and political figures of the day, usually with the figure matching the altered lyrics 
The video ended with the grim reaper appearing in front of a sunset. This version was due to be resurrected by Sting at the Live 8 concert, and the parody lyrics were cleared with their writers Quentin Reynolds and James Glen, but plans were abandoned at the last minute.

The closing music for series 8 episode 3 featured an ensemble of characters performing &quot;We All Hate Jeremy Beadle&quot;, in reference to the light entertainment host of that name. In series 9 episode 4, the show ended with &quot;Why Can&#x27;t Life Be Like Hello?&quot;, sung by June Brown (who was commonly known as the &quot;EastEnders&quot; character Dot Cotton). The song pastiches &quot;Hello&quot; magazine, in satire of post-Big Bang UK consumerist culture.

Other musical parodies featured Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Kylie Minogue, The Monkees, Pulp, Brett Anderson of Suede, Pet Shop Boys, R.E.M., Björk, East 17, Elvis Presley, Oasis, ZZ Top, Prince and Barbra Streisand.

==Decline==
The writers, Mark Burton, John O&#x27;Farrell, Pete Sinclair, Stuart Silver, and Ray Harris quit the show in 1993 and in 1995, and with viewing figures in decline, production was cancelled. The final series was initially planned for broadcast in autumn 1995 but was subsequently broadcast in January and February 1996, with the final episode featuring &quot;The Last Prophecies of Spitting Image&quot; in which Labour moved into Number 10. A few years later, most of the puppets were sold at an auction hosted by Sotheby&#x27;s, including a puppet of Osama bin Laden never used in the series.

During 2004, the idea of the series coming back started to appear after John Lloyd held talks with ITV executives about the show&#x27;s return. John Lloyd also held talks with a number of people who voiced the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; puppets, including John Sessions, Harry Enfield and Rory Bremner, with all responding positively.

Lloyd said: &quot;There&#x27;s enormous enthusiasm from ITV to do it. We&#x27;re just trying to work out how it would be affordable. The budget is about to go off to ITV. Everybody seems to have residual affection for &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. It could be scrappy and uneven, but it&#x27;s rather like a newspaper. You don&#x27;t expect it to be brilliant every time, but there&#x27;s something delicious in every edition.&quot;

By early 2006, ITV were producing a documentary celebrating the series and if the audience figures were good a full series might have been produced. On 25 June 2006, ITV transmitted &quot;Best Ever Spitting Image&quot; as a one-off special of &quot;Spitting Image&quot; which took a nostalgic look back at the programme&#x27;s highlights. This special actually prevented ITV directly resurrecting the famous satire as they had planned, because it featured new puppets of Ant &amp; Dec – a move which was against the wishes of Roger Law, who owns the rights to the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; brand.

&quot;Spitting Image&quot;, as ITV&#x27;s primary satirical programme, was succeeded by &quot;2DTV&quot;, a cartoon format that had five series between 2001 and 2004. In 2008 ITV created a CGI version to caricature and lampoon the famous, called &quot;Headcases&quot;, but it only aired for one series. Satirical puppets finally returned to ITV in 2015, in &quot;Newzoids&quot;.

==Archive donated to Cambridge University==
In 2018, &quot;Spitting Image&quot; co-creator Roger Law donated his entire archive – which includes original scripts, puppet moulds, drawings and recordings – to Cambridge University. The collection is located in the university library, with its librarian Dr Jessica Gardner describing the collection as a &quot;national treasure&quot;. She added, &quot;&quot;Spitting Image&quot; was anarchic, it was creative, it entered the public imagination like nothing else from that era. It is an extraordinary political and historical record. Great satire holds up a mirror, it questions and challenges.&quot;

==Broadcast dates==
All episodes and specials were broadcast on Sunday, usually at 10 pm. The programme was also picked up overseas. It aired on Canada&#x27;s CBC Television on Sunday nights in the late 1980s. The American network NBC aired several prime-time specials in the same period. Austrian public broadcaster ORF broadcast &quot;Spitting Image&quot; in English with German subtitles late on Friday nights in approximately four-week intervals in the late 1980s and early 1990s, introducing it to the German-speaking world (where foreign programming is usually dubbed into German). &quot;Spitting Image&quot; was also briefly shown in France on the private TV channel M6 in English with French subtitles. The show was also aired in New Zealand on TVNZ in the 1980s.

===Series===
===Specials===
==Repeats==
From November 1996 &quot;Spitting Image&quot; Series 1–11 were on UK Gold until September 1998. Edited episodes from Series 1–3 and 7 were on Granada Plus from 2001 to 2003.

In February 2008, Comedy Central Extra started showing regular repeats of &quot;Spitting Image&quot; from 9 pm on Tuesday evenings, with a whole weekend&#x27;s worth of evenings devoted to the first two series. It reappeared in a late night slot in November 2010, through to 18 December 2010 and has not been aired since then. From 2001 to 2004 the ITV series &quot;2DTV&quot; had a similar style, but using computer animation instead of puppets.

===United States version===

In an attempt to crack the American market, there were some attempts to produce a US version of the show. A 45-minute &#x27;made for market&#x27; show by the original &quot;Spitting Image&quot; team, titled &quot;Spitting Image: Down and Out in the White House&quot; was produced in 1986 by Central for the NBC network. NBC did not give this high priority. During the late summer, when viewership was traditionally low and the networks aired reruns of the previous season, NBC broke the special into two half-hour episodes and slotted them into its schedule on 30 August and 6 September of that year, following reruns of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;.

Introduced by David Frost, it departed from the sketch-based format in favour of an overall storyline involving the upcoming (at that time) Presidential election. The plot involved a conspiracy to replace Ronald Reagan with a double (actually actor Dustin Hoffman in disguise). This plan was hatched by the Famous Corporation, a cabal of the ultra-rich headed by Johnny Carson&#x27;s foil Ed McMahon (in the show, Carson was his ineffectual left-hand man) who met in a secret cavern hollowed out behind the façade of Mount Rushmore. Eventually, their plot foiled, the famous corporation activated their escape pod – Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s nose – and left Earth for another planet, but (in a homage to the beginning of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies) were destroyed during a collision with &#x27;a nonsensical prologue in gigantic lettering&#x27;.

The show did not achieve high ratings. It did, however, receive great praise from critics and it was followed by several more television specials: &quot;The Ronnie &amp; Nancy Show&quot; (also satirising the Reagans), &quot;The 1987 Movie Awards&quot; (sending up the Academy Awards), &quot;Bumbledown: The Life and Times of Ronald Reagan&quot; (a quasi-documentary about the President), and &quot;The Sound of Maggie&quot; (satirising Thatcher and parodying several musicals such as &quot;Oliver!&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot; and many others).

==Revival==

In September 2019, the show was confirmed to be returning 23 years after it originally ended, with the unveiling of the puppets of Greta Thunberg, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Mark Zuckerberg, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Roger Law stated that the pilot for the new series had been filmed and that talks were in progress with US networks to take the show to a larger, global audience, and that the revival is set to have a global appeal through a &quot;uniquely British eye&quot;. Among the writers for the revival will be Jeff Westbrook of &quot;Futurama&quot; (who also serves as executive producer), Al Murray, &quot;The Windsors&quot; creators Bert Tyler-Moore and George Jeffrie, Bill Odenkirk, David X. Cohen, Jason Hazeley, Keisha Zollar, Patric Verrone, Phil Wang, and Sophie Duker.

On 4 March 2020, the show was announced to be returning on the streaming service BritBox, as its first official commission. The show premiered on the service on 3 October 2020, featuring the voices of Billy West, Debra Stephenson, Debra Wilson, Guz Khan, Indira Varma, Jess Robinson, John DiMaggio, Lewis MacLeod, Lobo Chan, Matt Forde, and Phil LaMarr. It was cancelled on 24 October 2022.

==Home releases==
The programme was first released on video in 1986 in a series of three collections, each a compilation of material from the first two series: &quot;Spit – With Polish!&quot;, &quot;A Floppy Mass Of Blubber&quot; &amp; &quot;Rubber Thingies&quot;. All carried a 15 certificate and were reissued in 1988, also as a box set. 1989 saw the release by Central Video of two complete specials, &quot;Bumbledown: The Life &amp; Times Of Ronald Reagan&quot; and &quot;The Sound Of Maggie&quot; and was also released in the US by BFS Video. Next was a video containing a collection of the music videos from the programme, titled &quot;The Klassik Music Video Vol 1&quot;, released in 1991 by Central Video under The Video Collection Ltd (VCI or 2entertain); there was never a Volume 2.

&quot;Is Nothing Sacred?&quot; was released in 1992 by Surprise Video, compiling material from 1990 to 1991. The free booklet was written by Stewart Lee and Richard Herring. &quot;Havin&#x27; It Off: The Bonker&#x27;s Guide&quot; was released in 1993. In 1996 &quot;FA to Fairplay&quot; was released on VHS, later reissued on DVD in 2005. Made specially for video, it provided an alternative look at the 1996 European football championship held in England.

The Ronald Reagan song &quot;Da Do Run Ron&quot; featured in a straight to video release called &quot;Rockin&#x27; Ronnie&quot; (1986), an otherwise unrelated compilation of movie clips released by ATI Video.

The first 12 series including An 11-disc set (containing the first seven series broadcast 1984–89) have been released by Network Distributing under licence by ITV Studios, so far. Series 1–7 individual releases are now deleted. DVD releases do not include any of the specials made.

<doc id="216811" wikidata="Q926112" url="?curid=216811" title="Tarski's circle-squaring problem">
<text>Tarski&#x27;s circle-squaring problem is the challenge, posed by Alfred Tarski in 1925, to take a disc in the plane, cut it into finitely many pieces, and reassemble the pieces so as to get a square of equal area. It is possible, using pieces that are Borel sets, but not with pieces cut by Jordan curves.

==Solutions==
Tarski&#x27;s circle-squaring problem was proven to be solvable by Miklós Laczkovich in 1990. The decomposition makes heavy use of the axiom of choice and is therefore non-constructive. Laczkovich estimated the number of pieces in his decomposition at roughly 1050. The pieces used in his decomposition are non-measurable subsets of the plane.

Laczkovich actually proved the reassembly can be done &quot;using translations only&quot;; rotations are not required. Along the way, he also proved that any simple polygon in the plane can be decomposed into finitely many pieces and reassembled using translations only to form a square of equal area.

It follows from a result of that it is possible to choose the pieces in such a way that they can be moved continuously while remaining disjoint to yield the square. Moreover, this stronger statement can be proved as well to be accomplished by means of translations only.

A constructive solution was given by Łukasz Grabowski, András Máthé and Oleg Pikhurko in 2016 which worked everywhere except for a set of measure zero. More recently, Andrew Marks and Spencer Unger gave a completely constructive solution using about formula_1 Borel pieces.

==Limitations==
Lester Dubins, Morris W. Hirsch &amp; Jack Karush proved it is impossible to dissect a circle and make a square using pieces that could be cut with an idealized pair of scissors (that is, having Jordan curve boundary).

==Related problems==
The Bolyai–Gerwien theorem is a related but much simpler result: it states that one can accomplish such a decomposition of a simple polygon with finitely many &quot;polygonal pieces&quot; if both translations and rotations are allowed for the reassembly.

These results should be compared with the much more paradoxical decompositions in three dimensions provided by the Banach–Tarski paradox; those decompositions can even change the volume of a set. However, in the plane, a decomposition into finitely many pieces must preserve the sum of the Banach measures of the pieces, and therefore cannot change the total area of a set.

<doc id="216814" wikidata="Q1550247" url="?curid=216814" title="USS New York (LPD-21)">
<text>USS &quot;New York&quot; (LPD-21) is a , and the fifth ship of the United States Navy named after the state of New York.

==Naming==
Shortly after September 11, 2001, Governor of New York George E. Pataki wrote a letter to Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England requesting that the Navy bestow the name &quot;New York&quot; on a surface warship involved in the Global War on Terrorism in honor of the victims of the September 11 attacks. Pataki wrote that he understood state names were reserved for submarines, but he asked for special consideration so the name could be given to a surface ship. The request was approved on 28 August 2002.

===Sister ships names announced===
On 9 September 2004 Gordon R. England, then the Deputy Secretary of Defense, announced that two of &quot;New York&quot; sister ships would be named and in commemoration of the places where two of the other planes used in the attacks came down: Arlington County, Virginia, and Somerset County, Pennsylvania.

==Construction==

A symbolic amount of steel salvaged from the World Trade Center after it was destroyed in the September 11 attacks was used in her construction.

The ship is the first to be designed fully from the CAD-screen up to support both of the Marines&#x27; primary mobility capabilities, LCAC landing craft and MV-22B Osprey aircraft.

The contract to build &quot;New York&quot; was awarded to Northrop Grumman Ship Systems of New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2003. &quot;New York&quot; was under construction in New Orleans at the time of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

 of the steel used in the ship&#x27;s construction came from the rubble of the World Trade Center; this represents less than one thousandth of the total weight of the ship. The steel was melted down at Amite Foundry and Machine in Amite, Louisiana, to cast the ship&#x27;s bow section. It was poured into the molds on 9 September 2003, with cast to form the ship&#x27;s &quot;stem bar&quot;—part of the ship&#x27;s bow. The foundry workers reportedly treated it with &quot;reverence usually accorded to religious relics,&quot; gently touching it as they walked by. One worker delayed his retirement after 40 years of working to be part of the project.

==Christening and delivery==
&quot;New York&quot; was christened on 1 March 2008, in a ceremony at Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans. Ship sponsor Dotty England, wife of Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon R. England, smashed the traditional champagne bottle on the ship&#x27;s bow and christened the ship &quot;New York&quot;. Several dignitaries were in attendance, including Louisiana Congressman William J. Jefferson, members of the New York City Police Department and the New York City Fire Department, and family members of victims of the September 11 attacks. The champagne bottle did not break the first time it was struck against the hull of the ship, but the second attempt was successful.

The ship was delivered to the Navy on 21 August 2009 at New Orleans. She set sail for Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 October 2009. On 2 November 2009 the ship passed the World Trade Center site for the first time and gave the site a 21-gun salute.

==Commissioning and trials==

The commissioning ceremony for &quot;New York&quot; took place on 7 November 2009, in New York City. Speakers included Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Governor David Paterson, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, and Commandant of the Marine Corps General James T. Conway. Approximately one in seven of the plank owners are from New York state, a larger number than usual.

==Propulsion==
&quot;New York&quot; uses four Fairbanks-Morse license-built MAN Colt-Pielstick PC2.5 STC sequentially turbocharged marine diesel engines with inboard rotating Rolls-Royce controllable-pitch propellers. The V16-cylinder Colt-Pielstick PC2.5 STC engine is intended for use on ships requiring high propulsion power combined with a lightweight installation. Each V16 PC2.5 STC diesel engine weighs dry without flywheel.

On 11 January 2010, the Navy announced that the ship would have to undergo repairs for faulty engine parts after inspectors discovered the &quot;premature failure&quot; of bearings on the ship&#x27;s main propulsion diesel engines during a week-long sea trial following the November commissioning.

==Service history==
===2012===
On 10 June 2012 the ship was deployed for the first time to the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf region. She deployed with Marines from 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division and returned in December 2012 along with , and the Marines from the same unit attached to all three ships.

===2014===

In June 2014, the ship was used to transport Ahmed Abu Khattala, suspected mastermind of the 2012 Benghazi attack on the American diplomatic mission at Benghazi, back to the United States.

===2017===
On 11 September 2017, &quot;New York&quot; arrived off the Florida coast for Hurricane Irma relief, 16 years to the day after the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks.

===2018===
&quot;New York&quot; supported the reception night for the 23rd International Seapower Symposium at the Naval War College in Newport, RI in September 2018. In November, the ship supported Exercise Trident Juncture, a large scale NATO exercise involving more than 50,000 personnel, 65 ships, and 250 aircraft, including 14,000 American troops, a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) and an Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG).

<text>A military junta () is a system of government led by a committee of military leaders. The term &quot;junta&quot; means &quot;meeting&quot; or &quot;committee&quot; and originated in the national and local junta organized by the Spanish resistance to Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain in 1808. The term is now used to refer to an authoritarian form of government characterized by oligarchic military dictatorship, as distinguished from other categories of authoritarian rule, specifically strongman (autocratic military dictatorships); machine (oligarchic party dictatorships); and bossism (autocratic party dictatorships).

A junta often comes to power as a result of a coup d&#x27;état. The junta may either formally take power as the nation&#x27;s governing body, with the power to rule by decree, or may wield power by exercising binding (but informal) control over a nominally civilian government. These two forms of junta rule are sometimes called &quot;open rule&quot; and &quot;disguised rule&quot;. Disguised rule may take the form of either &quot;civilianization&quot; or &quot;indirect rule&quot;. Civilianization occurs when a junta publicly ends its obviously military features but continues its dominance. For example, the junta may terminate the martial law, forgo military uniforms in favor of civilian attire, &quot;colonize&quot; government with former military officers, and make use of political parties or mass organizations. &quot;Indirect rule&quot; involves the junta&#x27;s exertion of concealed, behind-the-scenes control over a civilian puppet. Indirect rule by the military can include either broad control over the government or control over a narrower set of policy areas, such as military or national security matters.

Throughout the 20th century, military juntas were frequently seen in Latin America, typically in the form of an &quot;institutionalized, highly corporate/professional junta&quot; headed by the commanding officers of the different military branches (army, navy, and air force), and sometimes joined by the head of the national police or other key bodies. Political scientist Samuel Finer, writing in 1988, noted that juntas in Latin America tended to be smaller than juntas elsewhere; the median junta had 11 members, while Latin American juntas typically had three or four. &quot;Corporate&quot; military coups have been distinguished from &quot;factional&quot; military coups. The former are carried out by the armed forces as an institution, led by senior commanders at the top of the military hierarchy, while the latter are carried out by a segment of the armed forces and are often led by mid-ranking officers.

A 2014 study published in the &quot;Annual Review of Political Science&quot; journal found that military regimes behaved differently from both civilian dictatorships and autocratic military strongmen. A military regime is ruled by a group of high-ranking officers, whereas a military strongman is ruled by a single dictator. The study found that (1) &quot;strongmen and military regimes are more likely to commit human rights abuses and become embroiled in civil wars than are civilian dictatorships&quot;; (2) &quot;military strongmen start more international wars than either military regimes or civilian dictators, perhaps because they have more reason to fear postouster exile, prison, or assassination&quot; and (3) military regimes and civilian dictatorships are more likely to end in democratization, in contrast to the rule of military strongmen, which more often ends by insurgency, popular uprising, or invasion.

<text>The Ottoman dynasty () consisted of the members of the imperial House of Osman (), also known as the Ottomans (). According to Ottoman tradition, the family originated from the Kayı tribe branch of the Oghuz Turks, under Osman I in northwestern Anatolia in the district of Bilecik, Söğüt. The Ottoman dynasty, named after Osman I, ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1299 to 1922.

During much of the Empire&#x27;s history, the sultan was the absolute regent, head of state, and head of government, though much of the power often shifted to other officials such as the Grand Vizier. During the First (1876–78) and Second Constitutional Eras (1908–20) of the late Empire, a shift to a constitutional monarchy was enacted, with the Grand Vizier taking on a prime ministerial role as head of government and heading an elected General Assembly.

The imperial family was deposed from power and the sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922 immediately after the Turkish War of Independence. The Republic of Turkey was declared the following year. The living members of the dynasty were initially sent into exile as &quot;personae non-gratae&quot;, though some have been allowed to return and live as private citizens in Turkey. In its current form, the family is known as the Osmanoğlu family.

==History==
The Ottoman dynasty operated under several basic premises: that the Sultan governed the empire&#x27;s entire territory, that every male member of the dynastic family was hypothetically eligible to become Sultan, and that only one person at a time could be the Sultan. Such rules were fairly standard for monarchic empires of the time. The certain processes through which men rose to the Sultanate, however, were very specific to the Ottoman Empire. To go into greater detail about these processes, the history of succession between Sultans can be divided into two eras: the period between the reign of Orhan (1323–1362), the first person to inherit the Ottoman sultanate, and the reign of Ahmed I (1603–1617); and the period following Ahmed I&#x27;s reign.
The succession process during the first period was dominated by violence and intra-familial conflict, in which the various sons of the deceased Sultan fought until only one remained alive and, thus, inherited the throne. This tradition was known as fratricide in the Ottoman Empire but may have evolved from tanistry, a similar succession procedure that existed in many Turco-Mongolic dynasties predating the Ottomans. Sons of the Sultan were often given provincial territories to govern until the Sultan&#x27;s death, at which point they would each vie for the throne. Each son had to, according to historian H. Erdem Cipa, &quot;demonstrate that his fortune was superior to the fortunes of his rivals&quot;, a demonstration that often took the form of military accomplishment and ruthlessness. This violence was not considered particularly unexpected or unusual. As Cipa has noted, the Ottoman words for &quot;successor&quot; and &quot;conflict&quot; share the same Arabic root, and indeed, all but one of the successions in this roughly 200-year period involved a resolution by combat. Over time, the combat became increasingly prevalent and recognized, especially after a Janissary uprising negated Murad II&#x27;s attempt to abdicate the throne peacefully to his son, Mehmed II, in 1444. During the eventual reign of Mehmed II (1451–1481), fratricide was legalized as an official practice; during the reign of Bayezid II (1481–1512), fratricide between Bayezid II&#x27;s sons occurred before Bayezid II himself died; and after the reign of Murad III (1574–1595), his successor Mehmed III executed 19 brothers to claim the throne.

During the second period, the tradition of fratricide was replaced by a simpler and less violent procedure. Starting with the succession from Ahmed I to Mustafa I in 1617, the Ottoman throne was inherited by the eldest male blood relative – not necessarily the son – of the Sultan, regardless of how many eligible family members were alive. The change in succession procedure was likely instigated by numerous factors, including fratricide&#x27;s decline in popularity among Ottoman elites and Ahmed I&#x27;s decision not to kill Mustafa when inheriting the throne from Mehmed III in 1603. With the door open for a policy change, a political debate arose between those who supported unrestricted Sultanic privilege and those who supported a stronger, centralized law system that would supersede even the Sultan&#x27;s power to an extent. Historian Baki Tezcan has argued that the latter faction – with the help of the influential &quot;şeyhülislam&quot; Hocazade Esad Efendi – was able to prevail in this instance. The bloodless succession from Ahmed I to Mustafa I in 1617 &quot;provided a reference for the eventual stabilization of the rule of Ottoman succession, the very regulation of which by an outside force was in effect a constitutional check on the dynastic prerogative,&quot; Tezcan has written. The precedent set in 1617 stuck, as the eldest living family member successfully inherited the throne in each of the following 21 successions, with relatively few instances of a son inheriting the throne.

==Succession practices==

From the fourteenth through the late sixteenth centuries, the Ottomans practiced open succession – something historian Donald Quataert has described as &quot;survival of the fittest, not eldest, son.&quot; During their father&#x27;s lifetime, all adult sons of the reigning Osmanoğlu family&#x27;s sultan were given provincial governorships in order to gain experience in administration (a practice commonly found in Central Asian tradition), accompanied and mentored by their retinues and tutors. Upon the death of their father, the reigning sultan, these sons would fight amongst themselves for the succession until one emerged triumphant. The first son to reach the capital and seize control of the court would usually become the new ruler. The proximity of a Şehzade (=Prince) to Constantinople improved his chances of success, simply because he could hear of his father&#x27;s death, seize control of the Ottoman court in the capital, and declare himself Sultan first. A Sultan could thus hint at his preferred successor by giving a favourite son a closer governorship. Bayezid II, for instance, had to fight his brother Cem Sultan in the 1480s for the right to rule.

Occasionally, the half-brothers would begin the struggle even before the death of their father. Under Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566), strife between his sons Şehzade Mustafa and Şehzade Selim (later Selim II) caused such internal turmoil that Suleiman ordered the deaths of both Şehzade Mustafa and another son, Şehzade Bayezid, leaving Şehzade Selim the sole heir.

During the reigns of Suleiman I and Selim II, the &quot;Haseki Sultan&quot; (Ottoman Turkish: خاصکى سلطان) or chief consort rose to greater prominence. Gaining power within the Imperial Harem, the favourite was able to manoeuvre to ensure the succession for one of her sons. This led to a short period of effective primogeniture. However, unlike in the earlier period, when the sultan had already defeated his brothers and potential rivals for the throne in battle, these sultans had the problem of many half-brothers who could act as the focus for rival factions. Thus, to prevent attempts at seizing the throne, reigning sultans practiced fratricide upon accession, starting with Murad I in 1362. Both Murad III and his son Mehmed III had their half-brothers murdered. The killing of all the new sultan&#x27;s brothers and half-brothers (who were usually quite numerous) was traditionally done by manual strangling with a silk cord. As the centuries passed, the ritual killing was gradually replaced by lifetime solitary confinement in the &quot;Golden Cage&quot; or &quot;kafes&quot;, a room in the harem from where the sultan&#x27;s brothers could never escape, unless perchance they became heir presumptive. Some had already become mentally unstable by the time they were asked to reign.

Mehmed III was the last sultan to have previously held a provincial governorship. Sons now remained within the harem until the death of their father. This not only denied them the ability to form powerful factions capable of usurping their father but also denied them the opportunity to have children while their father remained alive. Thus, when Mehmet&#x27;s son came to the throne as Ahmed I, he had no children of his own. Moreover, as a minor, there was no evidence he could have children. This had the potential to create a crisis of succession and led to a gradual end to fratricide. Ahmed had some of his brothers killed, but not Mustafa (later Mustafa I). Similarly, Osman II allowed his half-brothers Murad IV and Ibrahim to live. This led to a shift in the 17th century from a system of primogeniture to one based on agnatic seniority, in which the eldest male within the dynasty succeeded, also to guarantee adult sultans and prevent both fratricides as well as the sultanate of women. Thus, Mustafa succeeded his brother Ahmed; Suleiman II and Ahmed II succeeded their brother Mehmed IV before being succeeded in turn by Mehmed&#x27;s son Mustafa II. Agnatic seniority explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his son, but usually by an uncle or brother. It also meant that potential rulers had to wait a long time in the &quot;kafes&quot; before ascending the throne, hence the old age of certain sultans upon their enthronement. Although attempts were made in the 19th century to replace agnatic seniority with primogeniture, they were unsuccessful, and seniority was retained until the abolition of the sultanate in 1922.

<doc id="216817" wikidata="Q1339406" url="?curid=216817" title="Running mate">
<text>A running mate is a person running together with another person on a joint ticket during an election. The term is most often used in reference to the person in the subordinate position (such as the vice presidential candidate running with a presidential candidate) but can also properly be used when referring to both candidates, such as by saying Donald Trump and JD Vance, and William Ruto and Rigathi Gachagua, were running mates in relation to the presidential elections held in the United States in 2024 and Kenya in 2022 respectively.

Running mates may be chosen, by custom or by law, to balance the ticket geographically, ideologically, or personally; examples of such a custom for each of the criteria are, geographically, in Nigerian general elections, in which a presidential candidate from the predominantly Christian south is typically matched with a vice presidential candidate from the predominantly Muslim north, and vice versa, ideologically, the Brazilian general elections in 2010 and 2014, where Dilma Rousseff of the left-wing Workers&#x27; Party ran alongside Michel Temer of the center-right Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, and, personally, the 2016 Bulgarian presidential election, in which both candidates who went on to the second round of voting, Rumen Radev and Tsetska Tsacheva, had running mates of the opposite gender. The objective is to create a more widespread appeal for the ticket and the results can range from assisting the resulting pair of candidates in appealing to a larger base of people to deterring voters who were initially inclined to vote for the running candidate, but may have been put off by the choice of the running mate.

The term is usually used in countries in which the offices of president and vice president are both directly elected on the same ticket, in reference to a prospective vice president. However, there are countries, such as the Philippines and (nominally) Cyprus, in which the president and vice-president are elected on separate tickets, and frequently, this results in them being from different political parties – indeed, when the Philippine vice-presidential position was restored in 1987, only twice were the president and vice-president elected from the same ticket, in 2004 and 2022. Further, in other countries, such as Botswana and Venezuela, the vice-president is legally appointed by the president in all cases (unlike, for instance, the United States, in which the president appoints a vice-president only in case of a vacancy, or Taiwan, in which the president nominates candidates for vice-president in case of a vacancy and the Legislative Council elects one of them to fill the vacancy).

In cases of both separate elections and appointments, the president and vice-president are not considered running mates because they are not elected on the same ticket.

== In United States politics ==
In the United States, &quot;running mate&quot; refers not only to a candidate for vice president (federal), but also to a candidate for lieutenant governors of those states where the governor and lieutenant governor are jointly elected. Historically, American running mates were chosen by political parties in consultation with the principal candidate (i.e., the person running for president or governor). 

In the late 1960s, it became the practice of the principal candidate in presidential elections to announce their preferred choice of running mate at their political party&#x27;s national convention. The current practice is for the presumptive nominee of a political party to announce their choice for running mate &quot;before&quot; the national convention which, because of the extensive primary election and caucus system, is becoming increasingly irrelevant.

The practice of running candidates for president and vice president together evolved in the nineteenth century. Originally, electors cast votes for two candidates on the same ballot for president; the candidate who finished second place in the tabulation became vice president. Starting in 1804, the president and vice president were elected on separate ballots as specified in the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution which was adopted in that year. As more and more states subsequently began to choose their electors by popular election instead of appointment (South Carolina being the last state to change, in 1860), candidates began to realize they could run together as a team for president and vice president instead of running completely separately for each office.

The practice of a presidential candidate having a running mate was solidified during the American Civil War. In 1864, in the interest of fostering national unity, Abraham Lincoln from the Republican Party (popular in the North) and Andrew Johnson of the Democratic Party (popular in the South) were co-endorsed and ran together for president and vice-president as candidates of the National Union Party. 

Notwithstanding that this party disbanded after the war ended, with the result that after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination he was succeeded by a Democrat, Johnson, the states began to place candidates for president and vice-president together on the same ballot ticket, thus making it impossible to vote for a presidential candidate from one party and a vice-presidential candidate from another party, as had previously been possible.

Presidential candidates from smaller states sometimes choose a vice presidential running mate from a state with a large number of electoral votes as in 1984, when Walter Mondale of Minnesota (10 votes) selected Geraldine Ferraro of New York (then 36 votes). 

It is preferred, but not legally required, that the running mate be from a different state from the presidential nominee, because each elector can vote for no more than one candidate from their own state. Running mates can also be chosen from swing states in order to boost a candidate&#x27;s chance of winning in the state.

== Outside the United States ==

In many countries in which there are a president and vice-president with both positions being directly elected by popular vote, the running mate of the winning presidential candidate automatically assumes the vice-presidency; a notable exception is the Philippines, in which one presidential candidate can be (and usually is) elected with the running mate of an opposing candidate.

In the Republic of Ireland, the term &quot;running mate&quot; refers to members of the same party who are running for the same constituency in a general election for Dáil Éireann.

<doc id="216824" wikidata="Q21482671" url="?curid=216824" title="O'Reilly">
<text>O&#x27;Reilly () is a common Irish surname. The O&#x27;Reillys were historically the kings of East Bréifne in what is today County Cavan. The clan were part of the Connachta&#x27;s Uí Briúin Bréifne kindred and were closely related to the Ó Ruairc (O&#x27;Rourkes) of West Bréifne. O&#x27;Reilly is ranked tenth in the top twenty list of most common Irish surnames. It is also the patronymic form of the Irish name Reilly (). The name is commonly found throughout Ireland, with the greatest concentration of the surname found in County Cavan followed by Longford, Meath, Westmeath, Fermanagh and Monaghan, and the Province of Leinster.

==Naming conventions==

==Overview==

Usually anglicised as Reilly, O&#x27;Reilly or Riley, the original form of the name, Ó Raghallaigh, denotes &quot;descendant of Raghallach&quot;.

The Ó Raghallaigh family were part of the Connachta, with the eponymous Raghallach said to have died at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. The family became the kings of East Breifne, modern-day County Cavan and County Longford.

The name is common and widespread throughout Ireland, ranked 11th most common in 1890 and in 1997.

A self-proclaimed and disputed O&#x27;Reilly Clan Chieftain to this day is at odds with the O&#x27;Rourke Clan Chieftain because he contests the recognised O&#x27;Rourke claim on the title Prince of Breifne. This was settled in 1994 when the Chief Herald of Ireland made the O&#x27;Rourke Chief the Prince of Breifne, but the Office of the Chief Herald stopped granting courtesy titles to Gaelic Chiefs in 2003 (see O&#x27;Rourke).

<doc id="216826" wikidata="Q697307" url="?curid=216826" title="List of heads of state of Argentina">
<text>Argentina has had many different types of heads of state, as well as many different types of government. During pre-Columbian times, most of the territories that today form Argentina were inhabited by Amerindian peoples without any centralized government, with the exception of the Inca subjects of the Northwest and Cuyo regions. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the King of Spain retained the ultimate authority over the territories conquered in the New World, appointing viceroys for local government. The territories that would later become Argentina were first part of the Viceroyalty of Peru and then the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. The May Revolution started the Argentine War of Independence by replacing the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the first national government. It was the Primera Junta, a junta of several members, which would grow into the Junta Grande with the incorporation of provincial deputies. The size of the juntas gave room to internal political disputes among their members, so they were replaced by the First and Second Triumvirate, of three members. The Assembly of the Year XIII created a new executive authority, with attributions similar to that of a head of state, called the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. A second Assembly, the Congress of Tucumán, declared independence in 1816 and promulgated the Argentine Constitution of 1819. However, this constitution was repealed during armed conflicts between the central government and the Federal League Provinces. This started a period known as the Anarchy of the Year XX, when Argentina lacked any type of head of state.

There was a new attempt to organize a central government in 1826. A new congress wrote a new constitution and elected Bernardino Rivadavia as President in the process. Rivadavia was the first President of Argentina. However, he resigned shortly after and the 1826 Constitution was repealed. The Argentine provinces then organized themselves as a confederation without a central head of state. In this organization, the governors of Buenos Aires province took some duties such as the payment of external debt or the administration of the foreign relations in the name of all provinces. Those governors were appointed by the Buenos Aires legislature, with the only exception of Juan Lavalle. Juan Manuel de Rosas kept the governor office for seventeen consecutive years until Justo José de Urquiza defeated him at the 1852 Battle of Caseros. Urquiza then called for a new Constitutional Assembly and promulgated the Argentine Constitution of 1853, which is the current Constitution of Argentina through amendments. In 1854, Urquiza became the first President of modern Argentina, acting both as head of government and head of state. However, the Buenos Aires Province had rejected the Constitution and became an independent state until the aftermath of the 1859 Battle of Cepeda, although the internecine conflict continued. Only after the subsequent Battle of Pavón in 1861, the former &quot;bonaerense&quot; leader Bartolomé Mitre became the first president of a unified Argentine Republic.

The succession line of constitutional presidents run uninterrupted until 1930, when José Félix Uriburu took government through a civic-military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. For many decades, there was an alternance between legitimate presidents and others that took government through illegitimate means. Those means included military coups, but also proscriptions of major political parties and electoral fraud. The last &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; occurred in 1976 and resulted in the National Reorganization Process, which ended in 1983. The retrospective recognition as presidents or heads of state of any &quot;de facto&quot; ruler that exercised its authority outside the Constitutional mandate is a controversial and relevant issue in Argentine politics. However, their government actions were recognized as valid following the &quot;de facto&quot; government doctrine that used to legitimize them. This doctrine was rejected by the 1994 amendment and would not be applicable for potential future coups. The current head of state is President Javier Milei, who took office on 10 December 2023.

<text>O&#x27;Reilly Media, Inc. (formerly O&#x27;Reilly &amp; Associates) is an American learning company established by Tim O&#x27;Reilly that provides technical and professional skills development courses via an online learning platform. O&#x27;Reilly also publishes books about programming and other technical content. Its distinctive brand features a woodcut of an animal on many of its book covers. The company was known as a popular tech conference organizer for more than 20 years before closing the live conferences arm of its business.

==Company==
===Early days===

The company began in 1978 as a private consulting firm doing technical writing, based in the Cambridge, Massachusetts area. In 1984, it began to retain publishing rights on manuals created for Unix vendors. A few 70-page &quot;Nutshell Handbooks&quot; were well-received, but the focus remained on the consulting business until 1988. After a conference displaying O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s preliminary Xlib manuals attracted significant attention, the company began increasing production of manuals and books. The original cover art consisted of animal designs developed by Edie Freedman because she thought that Unix program names sounded like &quot;weird animals&quot;.

===Global Network Navigator===
In 1993 O&#x27;Reilly Media created the first web portal, when they launched one of the first Web-based resources, Global Network Navigator (GNN). GNN was sold to AOL in 1995, in one of the first large transactions of the dot-com bubble. GNN was the first site on the World Wide Web to feature paid advertising.

===Conferences===
From 1997 to 2020, O&#x27;Reilly was known for producing tech conferences focused on areas ranging from software architecture, AI, big data, web development, design and more.

In March 2020, O&#x27;Reilly announced they would be closing the live conferences arm of their business.

Although O&#x27;Reilly Media got its start in publishing, roughly two decades after its genesis the company expanded into event production. In 1997, O&#x27;Reilly launched The Perl Conference to cross-promote its books on the Perl programming language. Many of the company&#x27;s other software bestsellers were also on topics that did not attract much attention of the commercial software industry. In 1998, O&#x27;Reilly invited many of the leaders of software projects to a meeting. Originally called the freeware summit, the meeting became known as the Open Source Summit. The O&#x27;Reilly Open Source Convention (which includes the Perl conference) was one of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s flagship events. Other key events include the Strata Conference on big data, the Velocity Conference on Web Performance and Operations, and FOO Camp. Past events of note include the O&#x27;Reilly Emerging Technology Conference and the Web 2.0 Summit. Overall, O&#x27;Reilly describes its business not as publishing or conferences, but as &quot;changing the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators.&quot;

====Discontinued conferences====
* Strata Data Conference
* OSCON (O&#x27;Reilly Open Source Convention)
* Velocity Conference
* Artificial Intelligence Conference
* TensorFlow World
* The O&#x27;Reilly Software Architecture Conference

* Money:Tech
* Gov 2.0 Expo and Gov 2.0 Summit (co-produced with TechWeb)
* O&#x27;Reilly school of technology (discontinued as of January 6, 2016)

===O&#x27;Reilly Network===
In the late 1990s, O&#x27;Reilly founded the O&#x27;Reilly Network, which grew to include sites such as:
* LinuxDevCenter.com
* MacDevCenter.com
* WindowsDevCenter.com
* ONLamp.com
* O&#x27;Reilly Radar

In 2008 the company revised its online model and stopped publishing on several of its sites (including Codezoo and O&#x27;Reilly Connection). The company also produced dev2dev (a WebLogic-oriented site) in association with BEA and java.net (an open-source community for Java programmers) in association with Sun Microsystems and CollabNet.

===O&#x27;Reilly Online Learning (formerly Safari Books Online)===
In 2001, O&#x27;Reilly launched Safari Books Online, a subscription-based service providing access to ebooks and videos as a joint venture with the Pearson Technology Group. The platform includes content from O&#x27;Reilly and over 200 publishers including Adobe Press, Alpha Books, Cisco Press, FT Press, Microsoft Press, New Riders Publishing, Packt, Peachpit Press, Prentice Hall, Prentice Hall PTR, Que and Sams Publishing.

In 2014, O&#x27;Reilly Media acquired Pearson&#x27;s stake, making Safari Books Online a wholly owned subsidiary of O&#x27;Reilly Media. O&#x27;Reilly did a redesign of the site and had success in expanding beyond Safari&#x27;s core B2C market into the B2B Enterprise market.

In 2017, O&#x27;Reilly Media announced they were no longer selling books online, including ebooks. Instead, everyone was encouraged to sign up for Safari or purchase books through online retailers such as Amazon.

In 2018, O&#x27;Reilly Media rebranded Safari to what is now O&#x27;Reilly online learning. The platform includes books, videos, live online training, O&#x27;Reilly conference videos, and more. In 2019, O&#x27;Reilly acquired Katacoda so users can experiment with code in the website itself.

===Web 2.0 phrase===
In 2003, after the dot com bust, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s corporate goal was to reignite enthusiasm in the computer industry. To do this, Dale Dougherty and Tim O&#x27;Reilly decided to use the term &quot;Web 2.0&quot; coined in January 1999 by Darcy DiNucci. The term was used for the Web 2.0 Summit run by O&#x27;Reilly Media and TechWeb (formerly CMP Media). CMP registered Web 2.0 as a Service Mark &quot;for arranging and conducting live events, namely trade shows, expositions, business conferences and educational conferences in various fields of computers and information technology.&quot; Web 2.0 framed what distinguished the companies that survived the dot com bust from those that died, and identified key drivers of future success, including what is now called cloud computing, big data, and new approaches to iterative, data-driven software development.

In May 2006 CMP Media learned of an impending event called the &quot;Web 2.0 Half day conference&quot;. Concerned over their obligation to take reasonable means to enforce their trade and service marks, CMP sent a cease and desist letter to the non-profit Irish organizers of the event. This attempt to restrict through legal mechanisms the use of the term was criticized by some. The legal issue was resolved by O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s apologizing for the early and aggressive involvement of attorneys, rather than simply calling the organizers, and allowing them to use the service mark for this single event.

===&quot;Make:&quot; and &quot;Craft:&quot;===
In January 2005 the company launched &quot;Make:&quot; magazine and in 2006 it launched Maker Faire. The flagship Maker Faire in San Mateo, CA, drew over 130,000 attendees. Other Faires around the world collectively draw millions. In 2012, O&#x27;Reilly Media spun out the Make properties into a separate venture-backed company, Maker Media, headed up by former O&#x27;Reilly executive and Make founder Dale Dougherty.

In the fall of 2006, O&#x27;Reilly added a second magazine, &quot;Craft:&quot;, with the tagline &quot;Transforming Traditional Crafts.&quot; &quot;Craft:&quot; folded in 2009.

In the summer of 2019, Maker Media laid off its entire staff and ceased operations.

===Post–Tim O&#x27;Reilly era===
In 2011, Tim O&#x27;Reilly stepped down from his day-to-day duties as O&#x27;Reilly Media CEO to focus his energy and attention on the Gov 2.0 movement. Since then, the company has been run by Laura Baldwin. Baldwin comes from a finance and consulting background.

===Infinite Skills acquisition===
In 2014 O&#x27;Reilly acquired Infinite Skills, a Canadian publisher of online and DVD video courses.

==Licensing==
O&#x27;Reilly uses Creative Commons&#x27; Founders Copyright, which grants the company exclusive use of content produced by the authors who sign with them for 28 years. Although it is shorter than the current default duration of the monopoly in copyright law, it is still quite restrictive compared with other, widely used, licenses offered by Creative Commons.

<text>Google Hacks: Tips &amp; Tools for Smarter Searching is a book of tips about Google by Tara Calishain and Rael Dornfest. It was listed in the &quot;New York Times&quot; top ten business paperbacks in May 2003, which was considered at the time to be &quot;unprecedented&quot; for a technology book, and &quot;even rarer&quot; for the topic of search engines. The book was first published by O&#x27;Reilly in February 2002, with a second edition coming in December 2004 () and a third edition in August 2006 ().

It covers tips of all kinds, from usage hints for the novice just using Google, to advice for the expert programming with the Google Web API. Much of the content provided in the book can also be used for Google Hacking, the act of finding security issues through Google searches. Most programming examples are written in Perl.

<doc id="216841" wikidata="Q1857641" url="?curid=216841" title="Stockholm School (economics)">
<text>The Stockholm School () is a school of economic thought. It refers to a loosely organized group of Swedish economists that worked together, in Stockholm, Sweden primarily in the 1930s.

The Stockholm School had—like John Maynard Keynes—come to the same conclusions in macroeconomics and the theories of demand and supply. Like Keynes, they were inspired by the works of Knut Wicksell, a Swedish economist active in the early years of the twentieth century.

William Barber&#x27;s comment upon Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s work on monetary theory goes like this:
== History and aspects ==
Two of the most prominent members of the Stockholm School were Stockholm School of Economics professors Gunnar Myrdal and Bertil Ohlin. The movement&#x27;s name, &quot;The Stockholm School&quot;, was launched in an article by Bertil Ohlin in the influential &quot;Economic Journal&quot; in 1937, &quot;Some Notes on the Stockholm Theory of Savings and Investment&quot;.

The article was published in response to the publication of Keynes&#x27; magnum opus, &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; in 1936, and its purpose was to draw international attention to the Swedish discoveries in the field, many of which had predated the discoveries of Keynes. Gunnar Myrdal was early in supporting the theses of John Maynard Keynes, maintaining that the basic idea of adjusting national budgets to slow or speed an economy was first developed in Sweden by him and the Stockholm School.

=== Scandinavian welfare state ===
Myrdal and Ohlin went on to further develop their theories, and in so doing, they developed the intellectual underpinnings of the modern north European welfare state. Their theories were embraced and implemented as national policy by the two powerful arms of the Swedish labor movement, the Swedish Social Democratic Party and the national labor union, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation.

In the post-World War II geopolitical situation of the Cold War, with two rival political blocks, their theories also achieved wide international appeal as a &quot;Third Way&quot;, i.e. a middle way between a market economy and a command economy. The objective of this &quot;third way&quot; was to achieve a high level of social equality without undermining economic efficiency.

== Leading members ==
* Gunnar Myrdal, professor at the Stockholm School of Economics, and later Stockholm University, spent many years in the U.S. writing the book &quot;An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy&quot;, an investigation into the situation of African Americans, funded by the Carnegie Foundation. Myrdal co-authored, together with his wife Alva Myrdal the book &quot;Crisis in the Population Question&quot;, published in 1934. The book served as a major source of inspiration for the construction of the modern Swedish welfare state, relying heavily on government intervention and social engineering to create a &quot;people&#x27;s home&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Folkhemmet&quot;). The work was later criticized for its discussion of racial issues. Myrdal received the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly known as the &quot;Nobel Prize for Economics&quot;) in 1974.
* Bertil Ohlin, professor at the Stockholm School of Economics, was party leader of the Swedish Liberal People&#x27;s Party, the largest opposition party in the Swedish Parliament, for over twenty years (1944–1967) battling the powerful incumbent Social Democratic government. Professor Ohlin developed, together with professor Eli Heckscher, a standard economic model of international trade, the &quot;Heckscher–Ohlin model&quot;. Ohlin received the Bank of Sweden Prize in 1977.
* Gustav Cassel, professor of economics at the Stockholm University, created the standard mathematical formulation of purchasing power parity, a central concept in microeconomics.
* Dag Hammarskjöld, economist. Second Secretary-General of the United Nations. In office 10 April 1953 – 18 September 1961 (when he died in a plane crash on a peacekeeping mission to the Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)). Dag Hammarskjöld is the only person to have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize posthumously (Alfred Nobel&#x27;s testament explicitly states that the prize should be awarded only to the living).
* Erik Lindahl (21 November 1891 – 6 January 1960) was another member of the Stockholm school; he proposed a method of financing public goods in accordance with individual benefits. In the Lindahl equilibrium, the quantity of the public good satisfies the requirement that the aggregate marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of providing the good.
* Ingvar Svennilson (14 March 1908 – 1972) became known for his theories in planned economics.
Other members, such as Erik Lundberg, continued as business cycle-oriented economists.

<doc id="216842" wikidata="Q426628" url="?curid=216842" title="Day of the Fight">
<text>Day of the Fight is a 1951 American short-subject documentary film financed and directed by Stanley Kubrick, who based this black-and-white motion picture on a photo feature he shot two years earlier for &quot;Look&quot; magazine.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Day of the Fight&quot; shows Irish-American middleweight boxer Walter Cartier during the height of his career, on April 17, 1950, the day of a fight with middleweight Bobby James.

The film opens with a short section on boxing&#x27;s history and then follows Cartier through his day as he prepares for the 10 P.M. bout. Cartier eats breakfast in his West 12th Street apartment in Greenwich Village, goes to early mass, and eats lunch at his favorite restaurant. At 4 P.M., he starts preparations for the fight. By 8 P.M., he is waiting in his dressing room at Laurel Gardens in Newark, New Jersey, for the fight to begin.

We then see the fight itself, which Cartier wins in a short match.

===Cast notes===
* The year after the fight chronicled in &quot;Day of the Fight&quot; took place, Walter Cartier made boxing history by knocking out Joe Rindone in the first 47 seconds of a match (16 October 1951). Cartier had played some bit parts in movies before he appeared in &quot;Day of the Fight&quot;, and afterwards, up until 1971, he continued to appear occasionally in films and on television. With regard to his televised performances, his best known role is in the 1955-1956 season of the American sitcom &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; in which he portrays the mild-mannered character Private Claude Dillingham.
* Alexander Singer, who was a high-school friend of Stanley Kubrick (both attended William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx), served as assistant director and as a cameraman on this production. Singer also worked on Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Killing&quot; (1956), and had a long career as a director of films and television dramas.
*Douglas Edwards, the narrator on &quot;Day of the Fight&quot;, was a veteran CBS radio and television newscaster. At the time, he was the anchor on the first televised daily news program, which would later be titled &quot;Douglas Edwards with the News&quot; and then &quot;The CBS Evening News&quot;.

==Production==
Kubrick and Singer used daylight-loading Eyemo cameras that take 100-foot spools of 35mm black-and-white film to shoot the fight, with Kubrick shooting hand-held (often from below) and Singer&#x27;s camera on a tripod. The 100-foot reels required constant reloading, and Kubrick did not catch the knock-out punch which ended the bout because he was reloading. Singer did, however.

&quot;Day of the Fight&quot; is the first film credit on composer Gerald Fried&#x27;s resume. Kubrick did not pay him for his work in scoring the production. &quot;He thought the very fact that my doing the music&quot; for the film &quot;got me into the profession was enough payment&quot;, Fried told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2018, although he conceded in the same newspaper interview that Kubrick&#x27;s point was accurate. A childhood friend of Kubrick, Fried later composed the score for the director&#x27;s &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957) and three other films.

Since the original planned buyer of the documentary went out of business, Kubrick was able to sell &quot;Day of the Fight&quot; to RKO Pictures for $4,000, resulting in only a net profit of $100 for him after paying the film&#x27;s $3,900 in production costs. However, the physicist and author Jeremy Bernstein, who in November 1965 conducted a 76-minute interview with Kubrick for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, documented that the project was actually not a break-even endeavor, that it instead lost $100.

&quot;Day of the Fight&quot; was released as part of RKO-Pathé&#x27;s &quot;This Is America&quot; series and premiered on 26 April 1951 at New York&#x27;s Paramount Theater, on the same program as the film &quot;My Forbidden Past&quot;. Frank Sinatra headlined the live stage show that day

<text>The Consulate () was the top-level government of the First French Republic from the fall of the Directory in the coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799 until the start of the French Empire on 18 May 1804. By extension, the term &quot;The Consulate&quot; also refers to this period of French history.

During this period, Napoleon Bonaparte, with his appointment as First Consul, established himself as the head of a more autocratic and centralised republican government in France while not declaring himself sole ruler. Due to the long-lasting institutions established during these years, Robert B. Holtman has called the consulate &quot;one of the most important periods of all French history.&quot; By the end of this period, Bonaparte had engineered an authoritarian personal rule now viewed as a military dictatorship.

==Fall of the Directory==

French military disasters in 1798 and 1799 had shaken the Directory, and eventually shattered it in November 1799. Historians sometimes date the start of the political downfall of the Directory to 18 June 1799 (Coup of 30 Prairial VII by the French Republican calendar). This was when anti-Jacobin Director Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, after only a month in office, with the help of the Directory&#x27;s only surviving original member, Paul Barras, also an anti-Jacobin, successfully rid himself of the other three then-sitting directors. The elections held for the two councils in March and April had produced a new &quot;Neo-Jacobin&quot; majority in the two bodies, and being unhappy with the existing five man Directory, by 5 June 1799, these councils had found an irregularity in the election of the Director Jean Baptiste Treilhard, who thus retired in favour of Louis-Jérôme Gohier, a Jacobin more &quot;in tune&quot; with the feelings in the two councils. The next day, 18 June 1799, anti-Jacobins Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai and Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux were also driven to resign, although one long time anti-Jacobin, popularly known for his cunning, survived the day&#x27;s coup; they were replaced by the Jacobin baron Jean-François-Auguste Moulin and by non-Jacobin, or &quot;weak&quot; Jacobin, Roger Ducos. The three new directors were generally seen by the anti-Jacobin elite of France as non-entities, but that same elite could take some comfort in knowing that the five man Directory was still in anti-Jacobin hands, but with a reduced majority.

Additional military disasters, royalist insurrections in the south, Chouan disturbances in a dozen departments of the western part of France (mainly in Brittany, Maine, and eventually Normandy), royalist intrigues, and the end became certain. In order to soothe the populace and protect the frontier, more than the French Revolution&#x27;s usual terrorist measures (such as the Law of Hostages) was necessary. The new Directory government, led by Sieyès, decided that the necessary revision of the constitution would require &quot;a head&quot; (his own) and &quot;a sword&quot; (a general to back him). With General Jean Victor Marie Moreau being unattainable as his sword, Sieyès favoured General Barthélemy Catherine Joubert; but, when Joubert was killed at the Battle of Novi on 15 August, he turned to General Napoleon Bonaparte.

Although Generals Guillaume Brune and André Masséna won battles at Bergen and Zurich, and the Allies of the Second Coalition lingered on the frontier as they had done after the Battle of Valmy, the fortunes of the Directory were still not restored. Success was reserved for Bonaparte, suddenly landing at Fréjus with the prestige of his victories in the East, and now, after General Lazare Hoche&#x27;s death (1797), appearing as sole master of the armies.

On 9 November 1799 (18 Brumaire VIII), Bonaparte led the coup of 18 Brumaire, seizing French parliamentary and military power and forcing the sitting directors of the government to resign. On the night of 10 November, a remnant of the Council of Ancients abolished the Constitution of the Year III, ordained the consulate, and legalised the coup in favour of Bonaparte with the Constitution of the Year VIII.

==The new government== 
Initially, the 18 Brumaire coup seemed to be a victory for Sieyès, rather than for Bonaparte. Sieyès was a proponent of a new system of government for the Republic, and the coup initially seemed certain to bring his system into force. Bonaparte&#x27;s cleverness lay in counterpoising Pierre Claude François Daunou&#x27;s plan to that of Sieyès, and in retaining only those portions of each which could serve his ambition.

The new government was composed of three parliamentary assemblies: the Council of State which drafted bills, the Tribunate which could not vote on the bills but instead debated them, and the &quot;Corps législatif&quot;, whose members could not discuss the bills but voted on them after reviewing the Tribunate&#x27;s debate record. The &quot;Sénat conservateur&quot; was a governmental body equal to the three aforementioned legislative assemblies and verified the draft bills and directly advised the First Consul on the implications of such bills. Ultimate executive authority was vested in three consuls, who were elected for ten years. Popular suffrage was retained, though mutilated by the lists of notables (on which the members of the Assemblies were to be chosen by the Senate). The four aforementioned governmental organs were retained under the Constitution of the Year XII, which recognised Bonaparte as the French sovereign, but their respective powers were greatly diminished.

Bonaparte vetoed Sieyès&#x27;s original idea of having a single &quot;Grand Elector&quot; as supreme executive and head of state. Sieyès had intended to reserve this important position for himself, and by denying him the job Bonaparte helped reinforce the authority of the consuls, an office which he would assume. Nor was Bonaparte content simply to be part of an equal triumvirate. As the years progressed he would move to consolidate his own power as First Consul, and leave the two other consuls, Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès and Charles-François Lebrun, as well as the Assemblies, weak and subservient. By consolidating power, Bonaparte was able to transform the aristocratic constitution of Sieyès into an unavowed dictatorship.

On 7 February 1800, a public referendum confirmed the new constitution. It vested all of the real power in the hands of the First Consul, leaving only a nominal role for the other two consuls. A full 99.9% of voters approved the motion, according to the released results.

While this near-unanimity is certainly open to question, Bonaparte was genuinely popular among many voters, and after a period of strife, many in France were reassured by his dazzling but unsuccessful offers of peace to the victorious Second Coalition, his rapid disarmament of the , and his talk of stability of government, order, justice, and moderation. He gave everyone a feeling that France was governed once more by a real statesman, and that a competent government was finally in charge.

==Bonaparte&#x27;s consolidation of power==
Bonaparte needed to rid himself of Sieyès and of those republicans who had no desire to hand over the republic to one man, particularly Moreau and Masséna, his military rivals. At the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800, what briefly seemed like a potential defeat for France was ultimately secured by the generals Louis Desaix and François Christophe de Kellermann. This offered a further opportunity to Napoleon&#x27;s ambitions by increasing his popularity. The royalist plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise on 24 December allowed Napoleon to make a clean sweep of the democratic republicans, who despite their innocence, were deported to French Guiana. Napoleon annulled the Assemblies and made the Senate omnipotent in constitutional matters.

The Treaty of Lunéville with Austria, which restored peace to Europe, was signed in February 1801. Austria, which had been disarmed by Moreau&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Hohenlinden, gave nearly the whole of Italy to France, and permitted Bonaparte to eliminate from the Assemblies all the leaders of the opposition in the discussion of the Civil Code. The Concordat of 1801, drawn up not in the Catholic Church&#x27;s interest but in that of his own policy, by giving satisfaction to the religious feeling of the country, allowed him to put down the constitutional democratic Church, to rally round him the consciences of the peasants, and above all to deprive the royalists of their best weapon. The Organic Articles hid from the eyes of his companions-in-arms and councillors a reaction which, in fact if not in law, restored to a submissive Church, despoiled of her revenues, her position as the religion of the state.

The March 1802 Peace of Amiens with the United Kingdom, of which France&#x27;s allies, Spain and the Batavian Republic, paid all the costs, gave Napoleon a pretext for endowing himself with a consulate, not for ten years but for life, as a recompense from the nation. Bonaparte&#x27;s path to emperor began with the Constitution of the Year X dated 4 August 1802 (16 Thermidor).

On 2 August 1802 (14 Thermidor, X), a second national referendum was held, this time to confirm Bonaparte as &quot;First Consul for Life&quot;. Once again, a vote claimed 99.7% approval.

As Bonaparte increased his power, he borrowed many techniques of the &quot;ancien régime&quot; in his new form of one-man government. Like the old monarchy, he re-introduced plenipotentiaries; over-centralised, strictly utilitarian administrative and bureaucratic methods, and a policy of subservient pedantic scholasticism towards the nation&#x27;s universities. He constructed or consolidated the funds necessary for national institutions, local governments, a judiciary system, organs of finance, banking, codes, and traditions of conscientious of a well-disciplined labour force.

France enjoyed a high level of peace and order under Bonaparte that helped to raise the standard of comfort. Prior to this, Paris had often suffered from hunger and thirst, and lacked fire and light, but under Bonaparte, provisions became cheap and abundant, while trade prospered and wages ran high.

In strengthening the machinery of the state, Bonaparte created the (Legion of Honour), the , and restored indirect taxes, an act seen as a betrayal of the Revolution.

Bonaparte was largely able to quell dissent within government by expelling his more vocal critics, such as Benjamin Constant and Madame de Staël. The Saint-Domingue expedition reduced the republican army to a nullity. Constant war helped demoralise and scatter the military&#x27;s leaders, who were jealous of their &quot;comrade&quot; Bonaparte. The last major challenge to Bonaparte&#x27;s authority came from Moreau, who was compromised in a royalist plot; he too was sent into exile.

In contradistinction to the opposition of senators and republican generals, the majority of the French populace remained uncritical of Bonaparte&#x27;s authority. No suggestion of the possibility of his death was tolerated.

==Duke of Enghien affair==

Because Bonaparte&#x27;s hold on political power was still tenuous, French royalists devised a plot that involved kidnapping and assassinating him and inviting Louis Antoine de Bourbon, the Duke of Enghien, to lead a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that would precede the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy with Louis XVIII on the throne. The British government of William Pitt the Younger had contributed to this royalist conspiracy by financing one million pounds and providing naval transport (with the ship of Captain John Wesley Wright) to the conspirators Georges Cadoudal and General Jean-Charles Pichegru for their return to France from England. Pichegru met Moreau, one of Bonaparte&#x27;s generals and a former protege of Pichegru, on 28 January 1804. The next day, a British secret agent named Courson was arrested and he, under torture, confessed that Pichegru, Moreau, and Cadoudal were conspiring to overthrow the consulate. The French government sought more details of this plot by arresting and torturing Louis Picot, Cadoudal&#x27;s servant. General Joachim Murat ordered the city gates of Paris to be closed from 7 pm to 6 am while Pichegru and Moreau were arrested during the next month.

These further arrests revealed that the Royalist conspiracy would eventually involve the active participation of the Duke of Enghien, who was a relatively young Bourbon prince and thus another possible heir to a restored Bourbon monarchy. The Duke, at that time, was living as a French &quot;émigré&quot; in the Electorate of Baden, but he also kept a rented house in Ettenheim, which was close to the French border. Possibly at the urging of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périogord, Bonaparte&#x27;s foreign minister, and Joseph Fouché, Bonaparte&#x27;s minister of police who had warned that &quot;the air is full of daggers&quot;, the First Consul came to the conclusion that the Duke must be dealt with. Two hundred French soldiers crossed the border, surrounded the Duke&#x27;s home in Baden and arrested him.

On the way back to France, d&#x27;Enghien stated that &quot;he had sworn implacable hatred against Bonaparte as well as against the French; he would take every occasion to make war on them.&quot;

After three plots to assassinate him and the further financing of a supposed insurrection in Strasbourg, Bonaparte had enough. Based on d&#x27;Enghien&#x27;s who were seized at his home in Germany and the material from the police, d&#x27;Enghien was charged as a conspirator in time of war and was subject to a military court. He was ordered to be tried by a court of seven colonels at Vincennes.

D&#x27;Enghien during his questioning at the court told them that he was being paid 4,200 pounds per year by Britain &quot;in order to combat not France but a government to which his birth had made him hostile.&quot; Further, he stated that &quot;I asked England if I might serve in her armies, but she replied that that was impossible: I must wait on the Rhine, where I would have a part to play immediately, and I was in fact waiting.&quot;

D&#x27;Enghien was found guilty of being in violation of Article 2 of a law of 6 October 1791, to wit, &quot;Any conspiracy and plot aimed at disturbing the State by civil war, and arming the citizens against one another, or against lawful authority, will be punished by death.&quot; He was executed in the ditch of the fortress of Vincennes.

The aftermath caused hardly a ripple in France, but abroad, it produced a storm of anger. Many of those who had favoured or been neutral to Bonaparte now turned against him, but Bonaparte always assumed full responsibility for allowing the execution and continued to believe that, on balance, he had done the right thing.

<text>The Network Information Service, or NIS (originally called Yellow Pages or YP), is a client–server directory service protocol for distributing system configuration data such as user and host names between computers on a computer network. Sun Microsystems developed the NIS; the technology is licensed to virtually all other Unix vendors.

Because British Telecom PLC owned the name &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; as a registered trademark in the United Kingdom for its paper-based, commercial telephone directory, Sun changed the name of its system to NIS, though all the commands and functions still start with &quot;yp&quot;.

A NIS/YP system maintains and distributes a central directory of user and group information, hostnames, e-mail aliases and other text-based tables of information in a computer network. For example, in a common UNIX environment, the list of users for identification is placed in and secret authentication hashes in . NIS adds another &quot;global&quot; user list which is used for identifying users on any client of the NIS domain.

Administrators have the ability to configure NIS to serve password data to outside processes to authenticate users using various versions of the Unix crypt(3) hash algorithms. However, in such cases, any NIS(0307) client can retrieve the entire password database for offline inspection. 

==Successor technologies==
The original NIS design was seen to have inherent limitations, especially in the areas of scalability and security, so other technologies have come to replace it.

Sun introduced NIS+ as part of Solaris 2 in 1992, with the intention for it to eventually supersede NIS. NIS+ features much stronger security and authentication features, as well as a hierarchical design intended to provide greater scalability and flexibility. However, it was also more cumbersome to set up and administer, and was more difficult to integrate into an existing NIS environment than many existing users wished. NIS+ was removed from Solaris 11.

As a result, many users choose to remain with NIS, and over time other modern and secure distributed directory systems, most notably Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), came to replace it. For example, codice_1 (the standalone LDAP daemon) generally runs as a non-root user, and SASL-based encryption of LDAP traffic is natively supported.

On large LANs, DNS servers may provide better nameserver functionality than NIS or LDAP can provide, leaving just site-wide identification information for NIS master and slave systems to serve. However, some functionssuch as the distribution of netmask information to clients, as well as the maintenance of e-mail aliasesmay still be performed by NIS or LDAP. NIS maintains an NFS database information file as well as so called maps.

<text>A network information system (NIS) is an information system for managing networks, such as electricity network, water supply network, gas supply network, telecommunications network., or street light network

NIS may manage all data relevant to the network, e.g.- all components and their attributes, the connectivity between them and other information, relating to the operation, design and construction of such networks.

NIS for electricity may manage any, some or all voltage levels- Extra High, High, Medium and low voltage. It may support only the distribution network or also the transmission network.

Telecom NIS typically consists of the physical network inventory and logical network inventory. Physical network inventory is used to manage outside plant components, such as cables, splices, ducts, trenches, nodes and inside plant components such as active and passive devices. The most differentiating factor of telecom NIS from traditional GIS is the capability of recording thread level connectivity. The logical network inventory is used to manage the logical connections and circuits utilizing the logical connections. Traditionally, the logical network inventory has been a separate product but in most modern systems the functionality is built in the GIS serving both the functionality of the physical network and logical network.

Water network information system typically manages the water network components, such as ducts, branches, valves, hydrants, reservoirs and pumping stations. Some systems such as include the water consumers as well as water meters and their readings in the NIS. Sewage and stormwater components are typically included in the NIS. By adding sensors as well as analysis and calculations based on the measured values the concept of Smart water system is included in the NIS. By adding actuators into the network the concept of SCADA can be included in the NIS.

NIS may be built on top of a GIS (Geographical information system).

Private Cloud based NIS is gaining in functionality and popularity. As much of the changes to the network are conducted on the field, this approach has significant benefits compared to traditional GIS. The as-builts can be documented on site using mobile connectivity to the NIS. Many of the products in this category, such as by Keypro offer easy to use web interface which requires no installations at the client workstation.

<doc id="216849" wikidata="Q1468953" url="?curid=216849" title="History of Northern Ireland">
<text>Northern Ireland is one of the four countries of the United Kingdom (although it is also described by official sources as a province or a region), situated in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It was created as a separate legal entity on 3 May 1921 under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The new autonomous Northern Ireland was formed from six of the nine counties of Ulster: four counties with unionist majorities Antrim, Armagh, Down, and Londonderry and two counties with slight Irish nationalist majorities Fermanagh and Tyrone in the 1918 General Election. The remaining three Ulster counties with larger nationalist majorities were not included. In large part unionists, at least in the north-east, supported its creation while nationalists were opposed.

The Troubles in Northern Ireland (1920–1922) were followed by decades of relatively peaceful rule by the Ulster Unionist Party-controlled government of Northern Ireland (1921–1972), interrupted by Luftwaffe attacks during World War II. Systemic discrimination against Catholics by the government ensured a high emigration rate from that community and contributed to its continued dislike of the partition of Ireland. The Troubles erupted in the late 1960s, and continued until the 1998 Belfast Agreement.

==Resistance to Home Rule==
From the late 19th century, the majority of people living in Ireland wanted the British government to grant some form of self-rule to Ireland. The Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) sometimes held the balance of power in the House of Commons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a position from which it sought to gain Home Rule, which would have given Ireland autonomy in internal affairs, without breaking up the United Kingdom. Two bills granting Home Rule to Ireland were passed by the House of Commons in 1886 and 1893, but rejected by the House of Lords. With the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 by the Liberal Party government (which reduced the powers of the Lords from striking down parliamentary Bills to delaying their implementation for two years), it was apparent that Home Rule would probably come into force in the next five years. The IPP and its predecessor, the Home Rule League, had been campaigning for this for almost fifty years.

However, a significant minority was vehemently opposed to the idea and wished to retain the Union in its existing form. Irish unionists had been agitating successfully against Home Rule since the 1880s, and on 28 September 1912, their leader, Edward Carson, introduced the Ulster Covenant in Belfast, pledging to exclude Ulster from home rule. The Covenant was signed by 450,000 men. Whilst precipitating a split with unionists in the south and west (including a particularly sizeable community in Dublin), it gave northern unionists a feasible goal to aim for.

By the early 20th century, Belfast, the largest city in Ulster, had become the largest city in Ireland. Its industrial economy, with strong engineering and shipbuilding sectors, was closely integrated with that of Great Britain. Belfast was a substantially Ulster Protestant city with a Catholic minority of less than 30 per cent, concentrated in the west of the city.

A third Home Rule Bill was introduced by the Liberal minority government in 1912. However, the Conservative Party was sympathetic to the unionist case, and so the political voice of Irish unionism was amplified in Parliament. After heavy amendment by the House of Lords, the Commons agreed in 1914 to allow four counties of Ulster to vote themselves out of its provisions for six years. Throughout 1913 and 1914, paramilitary militias were recruited and armed, firstly the unionist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), and in response, the nationalist Irish Volunteers. In reaction to the possibility of the UVF seizing weapons, units of the British army stationed in Ireland were ordered to occupy government buildings, to repel any assaults by the UVF and to guard armories. When (March 1914) orders were issued transferring officers from the main army base at the Curragh to the north of Ireland, numerous officers chose to resign their commissions rather than obey. See: Curragh incident. Events in Europe were to take precedence after the outbreak of World War I. Home rule was delayed for the duration of what was expected to be a short war, and unionist and nationalist leaders agreed to encourage their volunteers to join the British army.

==1916: Easter Rising, Battle of the Somme and aftermath==
During World War I, tensions continued to mount in Ireland. Hardline Irish separatists (known at the time as &quot;Irish Nationalists&quot; and later as &quot;Republicans&quot;) rejected Home Rule entirely because it involved maintaining the connection with Britain. They retained control of one faction of the Irish Volunteers, and in Easter 1916, led by Thomas Clarke, James Connolly and others attempted a rebellion in Dublin. After summary trials, the British government had the leaders executed for treason. The government blamed the small Sinn Féin party, which had little to do with it. The execution of the leaders of the rebellion turned out to be a propaganda coup for militant republicanism, and Sinn Féin&#x27;s previously negligible popular support grew. The surviving leaders of the Irish Volunteers infiltrated the party and assumed its leadership in 1917. (The Irish Volunteers would later become the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1919.) Republicans gained further support when the British government attempted to introduce conscription to Ireland in 1918. Sinn Féin was at the forefront of organising the campaign against conscription.

The 36th (Ulster) Division was one of the first units in the British Army to be sent into the Somme beginning in July 1916. Despite being one of the few divisions to achieve their objectives, the Ulstermen suffered nearly 85% casualties. Though the 36th Division was made up of both Catholics and Protestants from the north, one result from the heavy losses at the Somme was that the Unionist community became evermore determined to remain in the United Kingdom, believing themselves to have sacrificed their sons at the behest of the Crown. Nationalists joined in great numbers as well, with &quot;old&quot; Irish regiments from Munster and Leinster being greatly strengthened by these recruits. When the veterans of World War I, on both sides of the political divide, returned from the Front in 1918 and 1919, they came back as battle-hardened soldiers. In the general election of 1918, the Irish Parliamentary Party lost almost all of its seats to Sinn Féin. Of the 30 seats in the six counties that would become Northern Ireland, 23 were won by Unionists, including three Labour Unionists and five of the six IPP members returned in Ireland were elected in Ulster as a result of local voting pacts with Sinn Féin.

Guerrilla warfare gathered pace in Ireland in the aftermath of the election, leading to the Anglo-Irish War. Although lower in intensity in Ulster than the rest of Ireland, the conflict was complicated there by involving not only the IRA, British Army and Royal Irish Constabulary, but the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) as well.

==Partition==
The fourth and final Home Rule Bill (the Government of Ireland Act 1920) partitioned the island into &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; (six northeastern counties) and &quot;Southern Ireland&quot; (the rest of the island). Some unionists such as Sir Edward Carson opposed partition, seeing it as a betrayal of unionism as a pan-Irish political movement. Three Counties unionists (those living in the Ulster counties of Cavan, Donegal, and Monaghan) who found themselves on the wrong side of the new border that partitioned Ulster, felt betrayed by those who had joined them in pledging to &quot;stand by one another&quot; in the Ulster Covenant. The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; reassured unionists who felt guilty about this &quot;that it was better for two-thirds of passengers to save themselves than for all to drown&quot;. Many Irish nationalists also opposed partition, although some were gratified that Northern Ireland contained a large nationalist minority that would deny it stability.

The Treaty was given effect in the United Kingdom through the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922. Under Article 12 of the Treaty, Northern Ireland could exercise its &quot;opt out&quot; by presenting an address to the King requesting not to be part of the Irish Free State. Once the Treaty was ratified, the Parliament of Northern Ireland had one month to exercise this &quot;opt out&quot; during which month the Irish Free State Government could not legislate for Northern Ireland, holding the Free State&#x27;s effective jurisdiction in abeyance for a month.

On 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) the Parliament of Northern Ireland resolved to make the following address to the King so as to &quot;opt out&quot; of the Irish Free State:

On 13 December 1922 Prime Minister James Craig addressed the Parliament of Northern Ireland informing them that the King had responded to the Parliament&#x27;s address as follows:

==Early years of Home Rule==
Northern Ireland, having received self-government within the United Kingdom under the Government of Ireland Act, was in some respects left to its own devices.

The first years of the new autonomous region were marked by bitter violence, particularly in Belfast. The IRA was determined to oppose the partition of Ireland so the authorities created the (mainly ex-UVF) Ulster Special Constabulary to aid the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and introduced emergency powers to combat the IRA. Many died in political violence between 1920 and 1923, when Belfast experienced the worst violence in its history. See Bloody Sunday (1921) and The Troubles in Northern Ireland (1920–1922). Killings petered out in 1923 after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922.

The continuing violence created a climate of fear in the new region, and there was migration across the new border. As well as movement of Protestants from the Free State into Northern Ireland, some Catholics fled south, leaving some of those who remained feeling isolated. Despite the mixed religious affiliation of the old Royal Irish Constabulary and the transfer of many Catholic RIC police officers to the newly formed Royal Ulster Constabulary (1922), northern Catholics did not join the new force in great numbers. Many nationalists came to view the new police force as sectarian, adding to their sense of alienation from the state.

==1925–1965==
Under successive unionist Prime Ministers from Sir James Craig (later Lord Craigavon) onwards, the unionist establishment practised what is generally considered a policy of discrimination against the nationalist/Catholic minority.

This pattern was firmly established in the case of local government, where gerrymandered ward boundaries rigged local government elections to ensure unionist control of some local councils with nationalist majorities. In a number of cases, most prominently those of the Corporation of Derry, Omagh Urban District, and Fermanagh County Council, ward boundaries were drawn to place as many Catholics as possible into wards with overwhelming nationalist majorities while other wards were created where unionists had small but secure majorities, maximising unionist representation.

Voting provisions gave commercial companies multiple votes according to size and restricted the voting franchise to property owners, primary tenants and their spouses. Plural voting in local government elections by business owners continued in Great Britain until it was abolished, outside the City of London, by the Representation of the People Act 1969. It still exists in the City of London. The system of restricting the franchise ended in Great Britain in the 1940s but continued in Northern Ireland until 1969. and became increasingly resented. Disputes over local government gerrymandering were at the heart of the Northern Ireland civil rights movement in the 1960s.

In addition, there was widespread discrimination in employment, particularly at senior levels of the public sector and in certain sectors of the economy, such as shipbuilding and heavy engineering. Emigration to seek employment was significantly more prevalent among the Catholic population. As a result, Northern Ireland&#x27;s demography shifted further in favour of Protestants, leaving their ascendancy seemingly impregnable by the late 1950s.

The abolition of proportional representation in 1929 meant that the structure of party politics gave the Ulster Unionist Party a continual sizeable majority in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, leading to fifty years of one-party rule. While nationalist parties continued to retain the same number of seats that they had under proportional representation, the Northern Ireland Labour Party and various smaller leftist unionist groups were smothered, meaning that it proved impossible for any group to sustain a challenge to the Ulster Unionist Party from within the unionist section of the population.

In 1935, the worst violence since partition convulsed Belfast. After an Orange Order parade decided to return to the city centre through a Catholic area instead of its usual route; the resulting violence left nine people dead. Over 2,000 Catholics were forced to leave their homes across Northern Ireland.

While disputed for decades, many unionist leaders now admit that the Northern Ireland government in the period 1922–72 was discriminatory, although prominent Democratic Unionist Party figures continue to deny it or its extent. One unionist leader, Nobel Peace Prize joint-winner, former UUP leader and First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, described Northern Ireland as having been a &quot;cold house for Catholics&quot;.

Despite this, Northern Ireland was relatively peaceful for most of the period from 1924 until the late 1960s, except for some brief flurries of IRA activity, the (Luftwaffe) Belfast blitz during the Second World War in 1941 and the Border Campaign from 1956 to 1962. It found little support among nationalists. However, many Catholics were resentful towards the state, and nationalist politics was fatalist. Meanwhile, the period saw an almost complete synthesis between the Ulster Unionist Party and the loyalist Orange Order, with Catholics (even unionist Catholics) being excluded from any position of political or civil authority outside of a handful of nationalist-controlled councils.

Throughout this time, although the Catholic birth rate remained higher than for Protestants, the Catholic proportion of the population declined, as poor economic prospects, especially west of the River Bann, saw Catholics emigrate in disproportionate numbers.

Nationalist political institutions declined, with the Nationalist Party boycotting the Stormont Parliament for much of this period and its constituency organisations reducing to little more than shells. Sinn Féin was banned although it often operated through the Republican Clubs or similar vehicles. At various times the party stood and won elections on an abstentionist platform.

Labour-based politics were weak in Northern Ireland in comparison with Britain. A small Northern Ireland Labour Party existed but suffered many splits to both nationalist and unionist factions.

===Second World War===

====Belfast====

Belfast was a representative British city that has been well studied by historians. It was a key industrial city producing ships, tanks, aircraft, engineering works, arms, uniforms, parachutes and a host of other industrial goods. The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared. There was a major munitions strike in 1944. As a key industrial city, Belfast became a target for German bombing missions, but it was thinly defended; there were only 24 anti-aircraft guns in the city. The Northern Ireland government under Richard Dawson Bates (Minister for Home Affairs) had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was far enough away to be safe. When Germany conquered France in Spring 1940 it gained closer airfields. The city&#x27;s fire brigade was inadequate, there were no public air raid shelters as the Northern Ireland government was reluctant to spend money on them, and there were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers all the more difficult. After the Blitz in London during the autumn of 1940, the government began to build air raid shelters. In early 1941, the Luftwaffe flew reconnaissance missions that identified the docks and industrial areas to be targeted. Working class areas in the north and east of the city were particularly hard hit, as over 1,000 people were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Many people left the city in fear of future attacks. The bombing revealed terrible slum conditions in the city. In May 1941, in the final raid of the war on Belfast, Luftwaffe bombs inflicted extensive damage to the docks and the Harland and Wolff shipyard, closing it for six months. The Belfast blitz saw half of the city&#x27;s houses destroyed. About £20 million worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticised heavily for its lack of preparation, and Northern Ireland&#x27;s Prime Minister J. M. Andrews resigned.

====Derry====

With the outbreak of the Second World War and the start of the Battle of the Atlantic, the Admiralty decided to develop a large new naval base in Northern Ireland to serve as a base for convoy escorts, providing repair and refuelling facilities. Derry was selected as a prime location due to Londonderry Port being the UK&#x27;s most westerly port, providing the fastest access into the Atlantic. The naval base, named HMS &quot;Ferret&quot;, was a shore establishment. It was given a ship&#x27;s name as a &quot;stone frigate&quot;. After the end of the war, large numbers of captured German U-boats were surrendered to British forces on the Scottish and Irish coasts and were brought to Lisahally.

==The Troubles==
===Beginnings===
The Troubles were a period of ethno-political conflict in Northern Ireland which spilled over at various times into England, the Republic of Ireland, and mainland Europe. The duration of the Troubles is conventionally dated from the late 1960s and considered by many to have ended with the Belfast &quot;Good Friday&quot; Agreement of 1998. Violence nonetheless continues on a sporadic basis.

In the 1960s, moderate unionist prime minister Terence O&#x27;Neill (later Lord O&#x27;Neill of the Maine) tried to introduce reforms, but encountered strong opposition from both fundamentalist Protestant leaders like Ian Paisley and within his own party. The increasing pressures from Irish nationalists for reform and opposition by Ulster loyalists to compromise led to the appearance of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, under figures such as Austin Currie and John Hume. It had some moderate Protestant support and membership, and a considerable dose of student radicalism after Northern Ireland was swept up in the worldwide protests of 1968. Clashes between marchers and the RUC led to increased communal strife, culminating in an attack by a unionist mob (which included police reservists) on a march, known as the Burntollet bridge incident, outside Derry on 4 January 1969. Wholescale violence erupted after an Apprentice Boys march was forced through the Irish nationalist Bogside area of Derry on 12 August 1969 by the RUC, which led to large-scale disorder known as the Battle of the Bogside. Rioting continued until 14 August, and in that time 1,091 canisters, each containing 12.5g of CS gas and 14 canisters containing 50g, were released by the RUC. Even more severe rioting broke out in Belfast and elsewhere in response to events in Derry (see Northern Ireland riots of August 1969). The following thirty years of civil strife came to be known as &quot;the Troubles&quot;.

At the request of the unionist-controlled Northern Ireland government, the British army was deployed by the UK Home Secretary James Callaghan two days later on 14 August 1969. Two weeks later, control of security in Northern Ireland was passed from the Stormont government to Lieutenant-General Ian Freeland (GOC). At first the soldiers received a warm welcome from Irish nationalists, who hoped they would protect them from loyalist attack (which the IRA had, for ideological reasons, not done effectively). However, tensions rose throughout the following years, with an important milestone in the worsening relationship between the British Army and Irish nationalists being the Falls Curfew of 3 July 1970, when 3,000 British troops imposed a three-day curfew on the Lower Falls area of West Belfast.

After the introduction of internment without trial for suspected IRA men on 9 August 1971, even the most moderate Irish nationalists reacted by completely withdrawing their co-operation with the state. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) members of the Parliament of Northern Ireland withdrew from that body on 15 August and a widespread campaign of civil disobedience began.

===1972–1974===
Tensions rose higher after the killing of fourteen unarmed civilians in Derry by the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment on 30 January 1972, an event dubbed Bloody Sunday.
Many civilians were killed and injured by the indiscriminate bombing campaigns carried out, mainly by the Provisional IRA.
Throughout this period, the main paramilitary organisations began to form. In 1970 the Provisional IRA, was created as a breakaway from what then became known as the Official IRA. The Provisionals came from various political perspectives, though most rejected the increasingly Marxist outlook of the Officials and were united in their rejection of the Official&#x27;s view that physical force alone would not end partition. A campaign of sectarian attacks by loyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Defence Association (formed to co-ordinate the various Loyalist vigilante groups that sprung up) and others brought Northern Ireland to the brink of civil war. On 30 March 1972, the British government, unwilling to grant the unionist Northern Ireland government more authoritarian special powers, and now convinced of its inability to restore order, pushed through emergency legislation that prorogued the Northern Ireland Parliament and introduced direct rule from London. 1972 was the most violent year of the conflict. In 1973 the British government dissolved the Parliament of Northern Ireland and its government under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.

The British government held talks with various parties, including the Provisional IRA, during 1972 and 1973. The Official IRA declared a ceasefire in 1972, and eventually ended violence against the British altogether, although a breakaway group, the Irish National Liberation Army, continued. The Provisional IRA remained the largest and most effective nationalist paramilitary group.

On 9 December 1973, after talks in Sunningdale, Berkshire, the UUP, SDLP and Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and both governments reached the Sunningdale Agreement on a cross-community government for Northern Ireland, which took office on 1 January 1974. The Provisional IRA was unimpressed, increasing the tempo of its campaign, while many unionists were outraged at the participation of Irish nationalists in the government of Northern Ireland and at the cross-border Council of Ireland. Although the pro-Sunningdale parties had a clear majority in the new Northern Ireland Assembly, the failure of the pro-Agreement parties to co-ordinate their efforts in the general election of 28 February, combined with an IRA-sponsored boycott by hardline republicans, allowed anti-Sunningdale unionists to take 51.1% of the vote and 11 of Northern Ireland&#x27;s 12 seats in the UK House of Commons.

Emboldened by this, a coalition of anti-Agreement unionist politicians and paramilitaries organised the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike which began on 15 May. The strikers brought Northern Ireland to a standstill by shutting down power stations, and after Prime Minister Harold Wilson refused to send in troops to take over from the strikers, the power-sharing executive collapsed on 28 May 1974.

Some British politicians, notably former British Labour minister Tony Benn, advocated British withdrawal from Ireland, but many opposed this policy, and called their prediction of the possible results of British withdrawal the &#x27;Doomsday Scenario&#x27;, anticipating widespread communal strife. The worst fear envisaged a civil war which would engulf not just Northern Ireland, but also the Republic of Ireland and Scotland, both of which had major links with the people of Northern Ireland. Later, the feared possible impact of British withdrawal was the &#x27;Balkanisation&#x27; of Northern Ireland.

The level of violence declined from 1972 onwards, decreasing to under 150 deaths a year after 1976 and under 100 after 1988. The Provisional IRA, using weapons and explosives smuggled from the United States, the Republic of Ireland, and Libya, bombed England and various British army bases in continental Europe, as well as conducting ongoing attacks within Northern Ireland. These attacks were not only on security targets but also on commercial properties and various city centres. Arguably its signature attack would involve cars packed with high explosives. At the same time, loyalist paramilitaries largely (but not exclusively) focused their campaign within Northern Ireland, ignoring the uninvolved military of the Republic of Ireland, and instead claiming a (very) few republican paramilitary casualties. They usually targeted Catholics (especially those working in Protestant areas), and attacked Catholic-frequented pubs using automatic fire weapons. Such attacks were euphemistically known as &quot;spray jobs&quot;. Both groups would also carry out extensive &quot;punishment&quot; attacks against members of their own communities for a variety of perceived, alleged, or suspected crimes.

===1975–1998===
Various fitful political talks took place from then until the early 1990s, backed by schemes such as rolling devolution, and 1975 saw a brief Provisional IRA ceasefire. The two events of real significance during this period, however, were the hunger strikes (1981) and the Anglo-Irish Agreement (1985).

Despite the failure of the hunger strike, the modern republican movement made its first foray into electoral politics, with modest electoral success on both sides of the border, including the election of Bobby Sands to the House of Commons. This convinced republicans to adopt the Armalite and ballot box strategy and gradually take a more political approach.

While the Anglo-Irish Agreement failed to bring an end to political violence in Northern Ireland, it did improve co-operation between the British and Irish governments, which was key to the creation of the Good Friday Agreement a decade later.

At a strategic level the agreement demonstrated that the British recognised as legitimate the wishes of the Republic to have a direct interest in the affairs of Northern Ireland. It also demonstrated to paramilitaries that their refusal to negotiate with the governments might be self-defeating in the long run. Unlike the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement withstood a much more concerted campaign of violence and intimidation, as well as political hostility, from unionists. However, unionists from across the spectrum felt betrayed by the British government and relations between unionists and the British government were at their worst point since the Ulster Covenant in 1912, with similar mass rallies in Belfast. Unionist co-operation needed in tackling Republican violence became so damaged that in 1998 Margaret Thatcher said she regretted signing the Agreement for this reason. Republicans were also left in the position of rejecting the only significant all-Ireland structures created since partition.

By the 1990s, the perceived stalemate between the IRA and British security forces, along with the increasing political successes of Sinn Féin, convinced a majority inside the republican movement that greater progress towards republican objectives might be achieved through negotiation rather than violence at this stage. This change from paramilitary to political means was part of a broader Northern Ireland peace process, which followed the appearance of new leaders in London (John Major) and Dublin (Albert Reynolds).

==Northern Ireland Assembly ==

===The Belfast Agreement/ Good Friday Agreement===

Increased government focus on the problems of Northern Ireland led, in 1993, to the two prime ministers signing the Downing Street Declaration. At the same time Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Féin, and John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, engaged in talks. The UK political landscape changed dramatically when the 1997 general election saw the return of a Labour government, led by prime minister Tony Blair, with a large parliamentary majority. A new leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, initially perceived as a hardliner, brought his party into the all-party negotiations which in 1998 produced the Belfast Agreement (&quot;Good Friday Agreement&quot;), signed by eight parties on 10 April 1998, although not involving Ian Paisley&#x27;s Democratic Unionist Party or the UK Unionist Party. A majority of both communities in Northern Ireland approved this Agreement, as did the people of the Republic of Ireland, both by referendum on 22 May 1998. The Republic amended its constitution, to replace a claim it made to the territory of Northern Ireland with an affirmation of the right of all the people of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation and a declaration of an aspiration towards a United Ireland (see the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland).

Under the Good Friday Agreement, properly known as the Belfast Agreement, voters elected a new Northern Ireland Assembly to form a parliament. Every party that reaches a specific level of support gains the right to name members of its party to government and claim one or more ministries. Ulster Unionist party leader David Trimble became First Minister of Northern Ireland. The Deputy Leader of the SDLP, Seamus Mallon, became Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, though his party&#x27;s new leader, Mark Durkan, subsequently replaced him. The Ulster Unionists, Social Democratic and Labour Party, Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party each had ministers by right in the power-sharing assembly.

The Assembly and its Executive operated on a stop-start basis, with repeated disagreements about whether the IRA was fulfilling its commitments to disarm, and also allegations from the Police Service of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Special Branch that there was an IRA spy-ring operating in the heart of the civil service. It has since emerged that the spy-ring was run by MI5 (see Denis Donaldson). Northern Ireland was then, once more, run by the Direct Rule Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain, and a British ministerial team answerable to him. Hain was answerable only to the Cabinet.

The changing British position to Northern Ireland was represented by the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Stormont, where she met nationalist ministers from the SDLP as well as unionist ministers and spoke of the right of people who perceive themselves as Irish to be treated as equal citizens along with those who regard themselves as British. Similarly, on visits to Northern Ireland, the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, met with unionist ministers and with the Lord Lieutenant of each county – the official representatives of the Queen.

Dissident Republicans in the Provisional IRA who refused to recognize the Good Friday Agreement split from the main body and formed a separate entity known as the Real IRA. It was this paramilitary group that was responsible for the Omagh Bombing in August 1998 that claimed the lives of 29 including a mother and her unborn twins. In a break from traditional Republican policy, Martin McGuinness officially condemned the actions of the Real IRA, setting a precedent that resulted in the alienation and minuscule support for dissident groups within the Republican movement.

===Government collapse of 2002-2007===
However, the Assembly elections of 30 November 2003 saw Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) emerge as the largest parties in each community, which was perceived as making a restoration of the devolved institutions more difficult to achieve. However, serious talks between the political parties and the British and Irish governments saw steady, if stuttering, progress throughout 2004, with the DUP in particular surprising many observers with its newly discovered pragmatism. However, an arms-for-government deal between Sinn Féin and the DUP broke down in December 2004 due to a row over whether photographic evidence of IRA decommissioning was necessary, and the IRA refusal to countenance the provision of such evidence.

The 2005 British general election saw further polarisation, with the DUP making sweeping gains, although Sinn Féin did not make the breakthrough many had predicted. In particular, the failure of Sinn Féin to gain the SDLP leader Mark Durkan&#x27;s Foyle seat marked a significant rebuff for the republican party. The UUP only took one seat, with the leader David Trimble losing his and subsequently resigning as leader.

On 28 July 2005, the IRA made a public statement ordering an end to the armed campaign and instructing its members to dump arms and to pursue purely political programmes. While the British and Irish governments warmly welcomed the statement, political reaction in Northern Ireland itself demonstrated a tendency to suspicion engendered by years of political and social conflict. In August the British government announced that due to the security situation improving and in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement provisions, Operation Banner would end by 1 August 2007.

On 13 October 2006 an agreement was proposed after three days of multiparty talks at St. Andrews in Scotland, which all parties including the DUP, supported. Under the agreement, Sinn Féin would fully endorse the police in Northern Ireland, and the DUP would share power with Sinn Féin. All the main parties in Northern Ireland, including the DUP and Sinn Féin, subsequently formally endorsed the agreement.

=== 2007-2017 governance ===
On 8 May 2007, devolution of powers returned to Northern Ireland. DUP leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness took office as First Minister and Deputy First Minister, respectively. (BBC). &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, the 2005 track by Westlife, was played at their inauguration.

On 5 June 2008, Peter Robinson was confirmed as First Minister, succeeding Ian Paisley. In November 2015 he announced his intention to resign, stepping down officially in January 2016.

His successor as the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Arlene Foster, became the new First Minister on 11 January 2016. She was the first woman to hold the post of First Minister.

===Government collapse of 2017-2020===

On 9 January 2017, following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal, Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy First Minister, triggering the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election and the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive. Since then, the Executive has been in suspension and has not reformed.

The election marked a significant shift in Northern Ireland&#x27;s politics, being the first election since Ireland&#x27;s partition in 1921 in which unionist parties did not win a majority of seats, and the first time that unionist and nationalist parties received equal representation in the Assembly (39 members between Sinn Féin and the SDLP, 39 members between the DUP, UUP, and TUV). The DUP&#x27;s loss of seats also prevents it from unilaterally using the petition of concern mechanism, which the party had controversially used to block measures such as the introduction of same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland.

UUP leader Mike Nesbitt announced his resignation, following the party&#x27;s failure to make any breakthrough.

Sinn Féin reiterated that it would not return to a power-sharing arrangement with the DUP without significant changes in the DUP&#x27;s approach, including Foster not becoming First Minister until the RHI investigation is complete. The parties had three weeks to form an administration; failing that, new elections would likely be called.

While unionism has lost its overall majority in the Assembly, the result has been characterised by political analyst Matthew Whiting as being more about voters seeking competent local leadership, and about the DUP having less success than Sinn Féin in motivating its traditional voter base to turn out, than about a significant move towards a united Ireland.

Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire gave the political parties more time to reach a coalition agreement after the 27 March deadline passed. Sinn Féin called for fresh elections if agreement could not be reached. Negotiations were paused over Easter, but Brokenshire threatened a new election or direct rule if no agreement could be reached by early May. On 18 April, the Conservative Party Prime Minister, Theresa May, then called a snap general election for 8 June 2017. A new deadline of 29 June was then set for power-sharing talks.

The UK General Election saw both the DUP and Sinn Féin advance, with the UUP and SDLP losing all their MPs. The overall result saw the Conservatives losing seats, resulting in a hung parliament. May sought to continue as Prime Minister running a minority administration through seeking the support of the DUP. Various commentators suggested this raised problems for the UK government&#x27;s role as a neutral arbiter in Northern Ireland, as is required under the Good Friday Agreement. Talks restarted on 12 June 2017, while a Conservative–DUP agreement was announced and published on 26 June.

A new deadline was set for 29 June, but it appeared that no agreement would be reached in time, with the main sticking point over Sinn Féin&#x27;s desire for an Irish language act, rejected by the DUP, while Sinn Féin reject a hybrid act that also covers Ulster Scots. The deadline passed with no resolution. Brokenshire extended the time for talks, but Sinn Féin and the DUP remained pessimistic about any quick resolution.

Negotiations resumed in the autumn of 2017 but failed, leaving it in the hands of the UK Parliament to pass a budget for the ongoing financial year of 2017–18. The bill, which began its passage on 13 November, would if enacted release the final 5% of Northern Ireland&#x27;s block grant.

==== Negotiations resume, 2018 ====
Talks between the DUP and Sinn Féin recommenced on 6 February 2018, only days before the mid-February deadline where, in the absence of an agreement, a regional budget will have to be imposed by Westminster. Despite being attended by Theresa May and Leo Varadkar, the talks collapsed and DUP negotiator Simon Hamilton stated &quot;significant and serious gaps remain between ourselves and Sinn Féin&quot;. The stalemate continued into September, at which point Northern Ireland reached 590 days without a fully functioning administration, eclipsing the record set in Belgium between April 2010 and December 2011.

On 18 October the Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley introduced the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Bill, removing the time frame of an Assembly election until 26 March 2019, which could be replaced by a later date by the Northern Ireland Secretary for once only, and during which the Northern Ireland Executive could be formed at any time, enabling civil servants to take a certain degree of departmental decisions that would be in public interest, and also allowing Ministers of the Crown to have several Northern Ireland appointments. The Bill&#x27;s third reading was passed in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords on 24 and 30 October respectively. The Bill became Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act 2018 and came into effect after it received Royal Assent and was passed on 1 November.

During question period to the Northern Ireland Secretary on 31 October Karen Bradley announced that she would hold a meeting in Belfast the following day with the main parties regarding the implementation of the Bill (which was not an Act yet on that day) and next steps towards the restoration of the devolution and that she would fly to Dublin alongside Theresa May&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; deputy David Lidington to hold an inter-governmental conference with the Irish Government. No deal was reached at that time.

==== Gay marriage and abortion ====
Gay marriage and the liberalisation of abortion was legalised in Northern Ireland on 22 October 2019. The legalisation received royal assent on 24 July 2019 by way of an amendment to the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 which was primarily to implement sustainable governance in Northern Ireland in the absence of an executive. The British government stated that the legalisation would only come into effect if the executive was not functioning by 22 October deadline. Attempts to restart the assembly were made, predominantly by unionist parties, on 21 October, but Sinn Féin and Alliance refused to enter the Assembly. The legalisation was enacted and progress to restart Stormont stagnated for several months until a fresh election became likely.

==== COVID-19 ====
The COVID-19 pandemic reached Northern Ireland in February 2020. At the start of the first official lockdown, the Department of Health reported 3,445 deaths overall among people who had recently tested positive. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency reported 5,757 where the death certificate mentioned COVID as one possible cause (see Statistics). Northern Ireland has the lowest COVID death rate per population in the United Kingdom. Covid statistics were very available at the start of the pandemic. The vast majority of deaths were among those over the age of 60 and almost half were in care homes. According to figures, about 1 in 12 of over 5,700 who died from the acute infection were under 65.

On 23 March 2020, Northern Ireland went into lockdown with the rest of the UK. A stay-at-home order banned &quot;non-essential&quot; travel and contact with others, and schools, businesses, venues, amenities and places of worship were shut. Major events such as Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day were cancelled. A lengthy lockdown was forecast to severely damage the economy and lead to a large rise in unemployment. The health service worked to raise hospital capacity. In mid-April, Department of Health modeling indicated the health service in Northern Ireland could cope with the expected peak in cases. On 21 April, Northern Ireland&#x27;s chief scientific advisor said the curve of new cases had flattened, and the peak had passed.

The lockdown was gradually lifted in June–July, as infection and death rates dropped. Schools remained closed for summer break, but re-opened in September. The infection rate (or positivity rate) rose again that month and restrictions were re-imposed. On 16 October, Northern Ireland went into an eight-week lockdown, although schools remained open, and some restrictions were eased for one week. The lockdown was mostly lifted on 11 December. Following a brief easing of restrictions at Christmas, another lockdown was imposed on 26 December, including schools, as the positivity rate rose sharply. A mass vaccination program began, and the infection rate fell in early 2021. Schools re-opened in March, and the lockdown was gradually lifted from late April. In December, proof of vaccination or non-infection became mandatory to enter indoor venues.

=== 2020-2022 governance ===
In early January 2020, the British and Irish governments announced the text of a deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland, and to restore devolution.

The Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive (which collapsed three years ago) resumed on 11 January 2020 after an agreement titled &#x27;New Decade, New Approach&#x27; was signed between the DUP and Sinn Féin, and the British and Irish governments, and subsequently by most other parties.

In April 2021, Arlene Foster announced that she would resign as DUP leader on 28 May and end her tenure as First Minister at the end of June 2021.

On 3 February 2022, Paul Givan resigned as first minister, which automatically resigned Michelle O&#x27;Neill as deputy first minister and collapsed the executive of Northern Ireland.

=== The DUP Boycott of the NI Protocol and Restoration of Stormont 2024- present ===
On 18 January 2024, over 100,000 workers from the National Health Service, Translink NI and teachers&#x27; unions stage the Public Sector Strike over pay in many towns and cities including Belfast. On 30 January 2024, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party Jeffrey Donaldson announced that the DUP would restore an executive government on the condition that new legislation was passed by the UK house of commons. After two years of suspension, the NI Assembly meet on 3 February 2024 and appoint Michelle O&#x27;Neill as First Minister and Emma Little-Pengelly as Deputy First minister. This is the first time in the history of Northern Ireland that a republican has become First Minister.

<text>The Gothenburg School of Business, Economics and Law at the University of Gothenburg () is one of Sweden&#x27;s leading business schools, located in Gothenburg. It was founded in 1923 as an independent business college and is situated in the centre of the city. In 1961, it was integrated into the state-run university system, still as a separate college, but was then integrated into the University of Gothenburg in 1971.

The school holds the Triple Accreditation, i.e. AACSB, AMBA and EQUIS, certifying that all main activities are of the highest international standards.

== Facilities ==
The school relocated to its current premises in central Gothenburg in 1952, the present buildings being inaugurated in 1995, with further work and extensions conducted in 1996, 2003 and 2010. The main campus offers approximately 25,500 square metres of space, hosting lecture halls and office space for faculty members, as well as library facilities, a restaurant and the premises of the school&#x27;s Student Association.

The school was founded in 1923 as a private institution, serving a growing demand for internationally oriented academic and professional education among the manufacturing companies, shipping firms and trading houses of Gothenburg. Gothenburg-based globally oriented companies, such as SKF, Volvo and the leading shipyards, later became major employers of graduates from the school. After several decades of rapid growth in the Swedish economy and thus in the public system of higher education, the school became a public institution under Government auspices in 1960. After its amalgamation with the University of Gothenburg (the University) in 1971, it was recognized as an independent unit within the university in 1986. Since 1997, the school has had its faculty board, reflecting a high degree of sovereignty within the university system. In 1992, the school expanded its activities by adding a Master of Laws programme to its educational options. Its present English name, ‘the School of Business, Economics and Law’, was adopted in 2004 to reflect its three main pillars of research and education.

Over the years, the development of the school has combined consistency and dynamism in a close relationship with the society surrounding it. The school&#x27;s founders, in creating advanced higher education in Gothenburg, stressed the need for an academic base for the many local merchant firms engaged in overseas shipping and trade. Research conducted in close cooperation with the business community is essential to the school and has been so since its foundation.

The international orientation of businesses headquartered or operating in the area contributes to the school&#x27;s international focus. Language courses were introduced at the school as far back as the early 1920s, and the emphasis on international business studies led to the creation of Sweden&#x27;s oldest and largest Bachelor Programme in International Business and Economics, with French as one of the main subjects. Over the years, Spanish, German, Japanese, Chinese and English have been added as optional main languages to what is now known as the Programme in Business and Economics. The successive establishment of an extensive network of cooperation with foreign universities that today includes more than 150 agreements has furthermore strengthened the school&#x27;s international orientation.

In 2006, the Swedish Government declared that the Bologna system was to be implemented for all higher education. Since 1997, the organisation of Master programmes in English has continued to develop into what today is formally known as the Graduate School, the unit for all education within the second cycle of the Bologna system today delivering nine two-year Master Programmes in Business and Economics.

The school grants degrees at all academic levels and has comprehensive PhD programmes in all its disciplines. The Department of Business Administration – with a strong history of Management and Accounting research dating back to the 1920s – is one of the largest of its kind in the Nordic countries.
Today, the school&#x27;s student body exceeds 4,000 full-time students. The faculty includes 272 researchers and teachers of whom 109 are full professors or associate professors.

== The organisation of the school ==
According to the departmental structure that was to be fully implemented by January 1, 2013, the school is organised into four distinct departments:
* Business Administration
* Economics
* Law
* Economy and Society

The graduate school is an administrative entity outside the departments, with the responsibility for the Executive MBA, Specialised Master Programmes, the Visiting Professor Programme and the school&#x27;s GMAT Centre. The PhD programmes are the responsibility of the individual departments and not of the Graduate School.

== The faculty board and the school management team ==
The school&#x27;s faculty board consists of three categories of members; senior management of the school, senior faculty (who form a majority), and representatives for the students and employees appointed by the student association and the trade unions respectively. The dean chairs the board. The faculty board has overall responsibility for:
* Long-term strategy of the school
* Funding and allocation of resources
* Staffing
* Programme options and content
* Research strategies
* Principles for quality assessment

The school management team comprises the dean, the assistant dean and the vice dean. The dean is individually responsible for the executive management of the school, answering to the vice-chancellor of the university. Internally, the dean is in charge of the school&#x27;s strategy and its relationship with external stakeholders and holds a formal operating responsibility for staff, financial administration and infrastructure. The dean is also a member of the vice-chancellor&#x27;s management council at the university level. The assistant dean holds the main responsibility for research and postgraduate education, while the vice dean is responsible for master&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s education. Both the dean and the assistant dean are elected by the school&#x27;s members of faculty and administrators for six years. The remaining elected members of the faculty board have a three-year mandate. Student and union representatives are appointed by the respective associations.

== Advisory boards and committees ==
To ascertain that all decision-making processes are based on a qualified analysis of correct facts, the school management team and faculty board are backed by several advisory committees and boards. The Swedish Government stipulates that all preparatory and decision-making bodies dealing with educational matters within Swedish universities must have student representation. Accordingly, the Student Association is represented on all these advisory bodies.
All vacant academic positions are publicly advertised internationally and candidates are evaluated by external referees for proficiency and merit. An Appointments Board oversees the recruitment and evaluation process, with the final appointment decision being taken by the faculty board. Professors, who hold the highest academic position within the university, are formally appointed by the vice-chancellor following an application&#x27;s adoption by the faculty board.
Research and education activities are discussed and coordinated through two separate preparatory committees. The Preparatory Committee for Research includes representatives from all departments, as well as one PhD student representative, and is responsible for developing common strategies for research, principles for the allocation of research resources between the departments, common principles for quality assessment, etc. The committee is chaired by the Assistant Dean. The Preparatory Committee for Education comprises representatives from all departments, major education units and programmes of the school, as well as one student representative, and handles all major questions regarding education at Bachelor and Master levels. The committee is chaired by the Vice Dean.
The Advisory Board – made up of leading management executives from a wide variety of companies such as AB Volvo, Volvo Car Corporation, SKF and Stena, as well as the Swedish financial and public sectors – provides strategic advice to the school management team and practical support. It also functions as a key communication tool with some of the school&#x27;s most important stakeholders. Some of the Advisory Board members are alumni of the school.

== Research centres ==
In addition to the main intra-disciplinary research groups within the departments, a long-term strategy by the school has also been to build up research capacity within more focused units that are organised multi-disciplinarily. Research centres have been initiated to promote thinking outside the box, and at the same time facilitate active contacts with the business community to cooperate in dealing with applied research which is typical for a specific sector or a specific area.

* Centre for Business in Society
* Centre for Business Solutions
* Centre for Consumer Science
* Centre for Finance
* Centre for Global Human Resource Management
* Centre for Health Economics
* Centre for International Business Studies
* Centre for Regional Analysis
* Centre for Tourism
* Gothenburg Centre for Globalisation and Development

Researchers at the school are also active in cross-faculty centres hosted by other faculties, including:
* Business and Design Lab
* Centre for European Research (CERGU)
* Centre for Intellectual Property (CIP)
* Centre for Environment and Sustainability
* Lighthouse
