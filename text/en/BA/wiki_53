==Stage==

*Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s play &quot;The Virtuoso&quot; (1676) includes an old libertine named Snarl who entreats a prostitute, Mrs Figgup, to bring out the birch rods. It is unclear if he is to flog her or be flogged.

* Jean Genet&#x27;s play &quot;The Maids&quot; (1947) concerns two maids who play out dominant and submissive roles.

==Poetry==
*&quot;The Rodiad&quot; (1871), a pornographic poem on the subject of flagellation, falsely attributed to George Colman the Younger: probably by Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton.
*Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote poetry on erotic flagellation, some of which was published anonymously in &quot;The Whippingham Papers&quot; (ca. 1888).
*&quot;Squire Hardman&quot; (1967) by John Glassco, purporting to be a reprint of an 18th-century poem by George Colman the Younger, is a long poem in heroic couplets on the theme of flagellation.

==Music==
*&quot;The Masochism Tango&quot; (1959) by Tom Lehrer uses the powerful rhythm of tango music and iconic implements like castanets and roses to comedic effect.
*&quot;Venus in Furs&quot; (1966) by The Velvet Underground takes its title and subject matter from the 1870 novella of the same name by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. It is quite possibly the first pop song to detail an S&amp;M encounter and relationship in explicit, unequivocal terms.
*&quot;Little Toy Soldier&quot; (1967) by David Bowie is an early, unreleased track which recites lyrics from the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; as part of its chorus; although the song&#x27;s humorous treatment of S&amp;M owes more to the cockeyed psychedelia of Syd Barrett.
*&quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; (1969), &quot;Dirt&quot; (1970) and &quot;Gimme Danger&quot; (1973) by The Stooges all clearly indicate powerful masochistic tendencies and behavior on the part of the singer, Iggy Pop.
*&quot;Submission&quot; (1976) by The Sex Pistols is a song which uses wordplay (&quot;submission&quot; as short for &quot;submarine mission&quot;) to convey the ambiguities of an obsessive S&amp;M relationship, albeit obliquely.
*&quot;Whips &amp; Furs&quot; and &quot;I Need a Slave&quot; (both 1977) by The Vibrators are two classic London punk-era songs which address the topic of recreational S&amp;M.
*&quot;Bobby Brown&quot; from 1979&#x27;s Sheik Yerbouti by Frank Zappa is a narrative of a man who transforms from a misogynist teenager to a BDSM-practicing homosexual disc jockey after an unpleasant encounter from Freddie, a woman&#x27;s rights activist.
*&quot;Whip in My Valise&quot; (1979) by Adam and the Ants expresses a fascination with S&amp;M play in fairly explicit terms; many of Adam Ant&#x27;s other early songs of the 1970s, such as &quot;Rubber People&quot;, &quot;B-Side Baby&quot;, &quot;Ligotage&quot; and &quot;Beat My Guest&quot;, also describe similar kinds of sexual fetishes.
*&quot;Melt!&quot; (1982) by Siouxsie and the Banshees describes an intense romantic relationship in terms evocative of an S&amp;M encounter.
*&quot;Twisted Little Sister&quot; (1983) &amp; &quot;The Whip&quot; (1984) by Savatage
*&quot;Master and Servant&quot; (1984) by Depeche Mode
*&quot;Pleasureslave&quot; (1988) by Manowar
*&quot;Bed of Nails&quot; (1989) by Alice Cooper
*&quot;Pretty Tied Up&quot; (1991) by Guns N&#x27; Roses
*&quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; (1992) by Nine Inch Nails takes its title and refrain from Jean Paulhan&#x27;s preface to &quot;Story of O&quot;. Also 1994&#x27;s &quot;Closer&quot; dealt with the subject, as well as the visually provocative video, which showed images of lead singer Trent Reznor tied up and blind-folded. 
*&quot;Dominated Love Slave&quot; (1992) by Green Day, lyrics by Tré Cool, told from the point of view of a submissive masochist.
*&quot;Fetish&quot; and &quot;Baby Blue&quot; (both 1999) by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts are two songs focused on this theme.
*The video for &quot;Missile&quot; (2004) by IAMX shows Chris Corner first bound-down to a chair and then handcuffed with leather straps while his ex-girlfriend Sue Denim acts as a dominatrix.
*&quot;Ich Tu Dir Weh&quot; (2009) by Rammstein contains fairly extreme examples of S&amp;M, enough to get it banned from public display or sale to minors in Germany in November 2009 by the Federal Office for the Examination of Media Harmful to Young People (Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien). After a hearing, the ban was lifted in 2010. Several other songs by the band have also dealt with BDSM themes, such as &quot;Feuerräder&quot; and &quot;Bück Dich&quot;.
*&quot;S&amp;M&quot; (2011) by Rihanna from her album &quot;Loud&quot;.
*British electronic singer Andi Fraggs released a single &quot;Eroction&quot; in 2011 which heavily featured sadomasochism in its lyrics. Limited 100 CD copies were dispatched to UK S&amp;M clubs in a PVC sleeve.
* Madonna also embraced the S&amp;M aesthetic and content in much of her music. Firstly, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Justify My Love&quot; dealt with submission and sadomasochism both in the song and its controversial accompanying video. Then again in 1992 with her best-selling, widely notorious publication &quot;Sex&quot; and her coinciding album &quot;Erotica&quot;. The title track was accompanied again by another scandalous and provoking music video.

==Opera==
*&quot;Lady Bumtickler&#x27;s Revels&quot; (1872), a comic opera on the theme of flagellation written and published by John Camden Hotten.

<doc id="219506" wikidata="Q631313" url="?curid=219506" title="Boxing at the 1904 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1904 Summer Olympics, seven boxing events were contested, with the sport making its Olympic debut. The competitions were held on Wednesday, September 21, 1904 and on Thursday, September 22, 1904. Contestants in lighter weight classes could also compete in heavier classes. Oliver Kirk, winning the bantamweight and featherweight categories, thus became the only boxer to have won two gold medals in the same Olympics. George Finnegan, Harry Spanjer and Charles Mayer won one gold and one silver medal.

There was also a demonstration bout of women&#x27;s boxing, which would be added to the Olympic program in 2012.

==Medal summary==
Note: Jack Egan originally won the silver medal in the lightweight competition and the bronze medal in the welterweight competition. Later, it was discovered that his real name was Frank Joseph Floyd, in breach of AAU rules that banned fighting under an assumed name. In November 1905, the AAU disqualified Egan from all AAU competitions, and ordered him to return all his prizes and medals. 

Therefore, Russell van Horn was upgraded to silver and Peter Sturholdt was awarded the bronze in the lightweight competition, while Joseph Lydon retained bronze in the welterweight competition.

==Participating nations==
A total of 18 boxers competed at the St. Louis Games:

<doc id="219509" wikidata="Q6503531" url="?curid=219509" title="Law school in the United States">
<text>A law school in the United States is an educational institution where students obtain a professional education in law after first obtaining an undergraduate degree.

Law schools in the U.S. confer the degree of Juris Doctor (J.D.), which is a professional doctorate. It is the degree usually required to practice law in the United States, and the final degree obtained by most practitioners in the field. Juris Doctor programs at law schools are usually three-year programs if done full-time, or four-year programs if done via evening classes. Some U.S. law schools include an Accelerated JD program.

Other degrees that are awarded include the Master of Laws (LL.M.) and the Doctor of Juridical Science (J.S.D. or S.J.D.) degrees, which can be more international in scope. Most law schools are colleges, schools or other units within a larger post-secondary institution, such as a university. Legal education is very different in the United States than in many other parts of the world.

==Terminology==
A 2006 study found that the names of the 192 law schools approved by the American Bar Association (ABA) at that time included one of five generic identifiers: &quot;school of law&quot; (118), &quot;college of law&quot; (38), &quot;law school&quot; (28), &quot;law center&quot; (7), and &quot;faculty of law&quot; (1). However, in ordinary speech, &quot;law school&quot; is universally preferred for its &quot;brevity and clarity&quot;.

==Admission==
In the United States, law schools require a bachelor&#x27;s degree in any discipline, a satisfactory undergraduate grade point average (GPA), and a satisfactory score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) as prerequisites for admission. Some states that have non-ABA-approved schools or state-accredited schools have equivalency requirements that usually equal 90 credits toward a bachelor&#x27;s degree. 

Globally, the requirement of a bachelor&#x27;s degree is one of the most distinctive features of the American law school. Elsewhere, it is routine to award law degrees to undergraduates. In contrast, a typical American lawyer must first complete seven years of postsecondary education before they become eligible for a license to practice law. Another significant distinction is that, unlike many other countries where law professors usually hold doctorates, most American law professors have earned only the exact same J.D. degree which will be awarded to the students they are teaching.

Though undergraduate GPA and LSAT score are the most important factors considered by law school admissions committees, individual factors are also somewhat important.personal factors are evaluated through essays, short-answer questions, letters of recommendation, and other application materials. The standards for grades and LSAT scores vary by school. Interviews—either in person or via video chat—may be optional, or invitational, application components. Many law schools actively seek applicants from outside the traditional pool to boost racial, economic, and experiential diversity on campus. Most law schools now factor in extracurricular activities, work experience, and unique courses of study in their evaluation of applicants. A growing number of law school applicants have several years of work experience, and correspondingly fewer law students enter immediately after completing their undergraduate education. However, law schools generally only consider undergraduate and not post-collegiate transcripts when considering an applicant for admission; the former are considered by law schools to be a more uniform standard than the latter for judging academic performance.

Many law schools offer substantial scholarships and grants to many of their students, dramatically reducing the actual cost of attending law school compared to sticker tuition. Some law schools condition scholarships on maintaining a certain GPA.

, there were 128,641 students enrolled in JD programs at the 204 approved ABA law schools. A decade later, in 2023, J.D. programs enrolled 116,897 students at the 196 institutions then approved by the ABA. , women enrolled in American law schools have outnumbered men. In 2024, 56.09 percent of JD students enrolled at ABA-accredited schools were women.

==Accreditation==
To sit for the bar exam, the vast majority of state bar associations require accreditation of an applicant&#x27;s law school by the American Bar Association. The ABA has promulgated detailed requirements covering every aspect of a law school, down to the precise contents of the law library and the minimum number of minutes of instruction required to receive a law degree. , there are 203 ABA-accredited law schools that award the J.D., divided between 202 with full accreditation and one with provisional accreditation. The Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Legal Center and School in Charlottesville, Virginia, a school operated by the United States Army that conducts a post-J.D. program for military attorneys, is also ABA-accredited.

Non-ABA approved law schools have much lower bar passage rates than ABA-approved law schools, and do not submit or disclose employment outcome data to the ABA.

In addition, individual state legislatures or bar examiners may maintain a separate approval system, which is open to non-ABA accredited schools. If that is the case, graduates of these schools may generally sit for the bar exam only in the state in which their school is accredited. California is the most famous example of state-specific approval. The State Bar of California&#x27;s Committee of Bar Examiners approves many schools that may not qualify for or request ABA accreditation. Graduates of such schools can sit for the bar exam in California, and once they have passed that exam, a large number of states allow those students to sit for their bars (after practicing for a certain number of years in California).

California is also the first state to allow graduates of distance legal education (online and correspondence) to take its bar exam. However, online and correspondence law schools are generally not accredited by the ABA or approved by state bar examiners, and the eligibility of their graduates to sit for the bar exam may vary from state to state. Even in California, for instance, the State Bar deems certain online schools as &quot;registered&quot;, meaning their graduates may take the bar exam, but also specifically says the &quot;Committee of Bar Examiners does not approve nor accredit correspondence schools.&quot; Kentucky goes further by specifically disqualifying correspondence school graduates from admission to the bar. This applies even if the graduate has gained admission in another jurisdiction.

==Curriculum==

Law students are referred to as &quot;1L&quot;s, &quot;2L&quot;s, and &quot;3L&quot;s based on their year of study. In the United States, the American Bar Association does not mandate a particular curriculum for &quot;1L&quot;s. ABA Standard 302(a)(1) requires only the study of &quot;substantive law&quot; that will lead to &quot;effective and responsible participation in the legal profession.&quot; However, most law schools have their own mandatory curriculum for &quot;1L&quot;s, which typically includes:

* Civil procedure (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure)
* Constitutional law (United States Constitution, especially Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the Commerce Clause)
* Contracts (Article 2 (Sales) of the Uniform Commercial Code and Restatement (Second) of Contracts)
* Criminal law (General common law, Model Penal Code, and state criminal statutes)
* Property (General common law and Restatement of Property)
* Torts (General common law, Restatement (Second) and Restatement (Third) of Torts)
* Legal research (Use of a law library and computer-assisted legal research, including both LexisNexis and Westlaw)
* Legal writing (including objective analysis, persuasive analysis, and legal citation)

These basic courses are intended to provide an overview of the broad study of law. Not all ABA-approved law schools offer all of these courses in the 1L year; for example, many schools do not offer constitutional law and/or criminal law until the second and third years. Most schools also require Evidence but rarely offer the course to first-year students. Some schools combine legal research and legal writing into a single year-long &quot;lawyering skills&quot; course, which may also include a small oral argument component.

Because the first year curriculum is always fixed, most schools do not allow 1L students to select their own course schedules, and instead hand them their schedules at new student orientation.

At most schools, the grade for an &quot;entire&quot; course depends upon the outcome of only one or two examinations, usually in essay form, which are administered via students&#x27; laptop computers in the classroom with the assistance of specialized software. Some professors may use multiple choice exams in part or in full if the course material is suitable for it (e.g., professional responsibility). Legal research and writing courses tend to have several major projects (some graded, some not) and a final exam in essay form. Most schools impose a mandatory grade curve (see below).

After the first year, law students are generally free to pursue different fields of legal study. All law schools offer (or try to offer) a broad array of upper-division courses in areas of substantive law like administrative law, corporate law, international law, admiralty law, intellectual property law, and tax law, and in areas of procedural law not normally covered in the first year, like criminal procedure and remedies. Many law schools also offer upper-division practical training courses in client counseling, trial advocacy, appellate advocacy, and alternative dispute resolution. Depending upon the law school, practical training courses may involve fictional exercises in which students interact with each other or with volunteer actors playing clients, witnesses, and judges, or real-world cases at legal clinics.

Graduation is the assured outcome for the majority of students who pay their tuition on time, behave honorably and responsibly, maintain a minimum per-semester unit count and grade point average, take required upper-division courses, and successfully complete a certain number of units by the end of their sixth semester.

The ABA also requires that all students at ABA-approved schools take an ethics course in professional responsibility. Typically, this is an upper-level course; most students take it in the 2L year. This requirement was added after the Watergate scandal, which seriously damaged the public image of the profession because President Richard Nixon and most of his alleged co-conspirators were lawyers. The ABA desired to demonstrate that the legal profession could regulate itself, wished to reassert and maintain its position of leadership, and hoped to prevent direct federal regulation of the profession.

As of 2004, to ensure that students&#x27; research and writing skills do not deteriorate, the ABA has added an upper division writing requirement. Law students must take at least one course, or complete an independent study project, as a 2L or 3L that requires the writing of a paper for credit.

Most law courses are less about doctrine and more about learning how to analyze legal problems, read cases, distill facts and apply law to facts.

In 1968, the Ford Foundation began disbursing $12 million to persuade law schools to make &quot;law school clinics&quot; part of their curriculum. Clinics were intended to give practical experience in law practice while providing &quot;pro bono&quot; representation to the poor. However, conservative critics charge that the clinics have been used instead as an avenue for the professors to engage in left-wing political activism. Critics cite the financial involvement of the Ford Foundation as the turning point when such clinics began to change from giving practical experience to engaging in advocacy.

Law schools that offer accelerated JD programs have unique curricula for such programs. Nonetheless, ABA-approved law schools with Accelerated JD programs must meet ABA rules.

Finally, the emphasis in law schools is rarely on the law of the particular state in which the law school sits, but on the law generally throughout the country. Although this makes studying for the bar exam more difficult since one must learn state-specific law, the emphasis on legal skills over legal knowledge can benefit law students not intending to practice in the same state they attend law school.

==Grades, grading, and GPA curves==

Grades in law school are very competitive. Most schools grade on a curve. In most law schools, the first year curve (1L) is considerably lower than courses taken after the first year of law school.

Many schools use a &quot;median&quot; grading system, that can range from &quot;B-plus medians&quot; to &quot;C-minus medians&quot;. Some professors are obliged to determine which exam or paper was the exact median in terms of quality (e.g., the 26th best out of 51), give that paper the relevant grade depending on the system used, and then grade the other exams based on how much better or worse they are than the median. A few schools, such as Yale Law School, Stanford Law School, Harvard Law School, University of California, Berkeley School of Law, and Northeastern University School of Law have alternate grading systems that put less emphasis (or no emphasis) on rank. Other schools, such as New York&#x27;s Fordham Law School, use a forced grading distribution, where a predetermined percentage of students must receive certain grades. For instance, such a system could oblige professors to award a minimum and maximum number of &quot;A&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;F&#x27;s&quot; (e.g., 3.5%/7% A&#x27;s and 4.5%/10% F&#x27;s). Many professors chafe against the lack of discretion provided by such systems, especially the required failing of a certain number of students whose performance may have been sub-par but not, in the professor&#x27;s estimation, worthy of a failing grade. The &quot;median&quot; system seeks to provide some parity among teachers&#x27; grading scales while giving the teacher discretion to award a grade below the median only when deserved.

Fairness and equity are the primary reasons for required curves and required grade distributions. Some faculty tend to give higher grades and others lower grades, with a mandatory curve balancing both extremes. Also, at law schools with multiple sections of the same class, it minimizes the problem that one section will have an unfair advantage over another section when applying for Law Review or Moot Court.

Even with curved grading, some law schools such as Syracuse University College of Law still have a policy of &quot;Dismissal for Academic Deficiency&quot;, in which students failing to meet a minimum GPA are dismissed from the school.

One school that has deviated from the system of competitive grading common to most American law schools is Northeastern University School of Law. Northeastern does not have any system of grade point averages or class rank, Instead, the school uses a system of narrative evaluations to measure student performance.

A system of anonymous grading known as blind grading is used in many law schools in the United States. It is intended to counter bias by the grader. Each semester students are assigned random numbers, usually by the Registrar&#x27;s Office, which students must include on their exams. Professors then grade the exams on an anonymous basis, only discovering student names after grades have been submitted to the Registrar&#x27;s Office. General adoption of blind grading followed admission of significant numbers of minority students to law schools.

==Accelerated JD programs==
An Accelerated JD program may refer to one of the following:
* A program that combines a bachelor&#x27;s degree with a juris doctor degree (&quot;3+3 JD program&quot; or &quot;BA to JD program&quot;).
* A two-year juris doctor degree that is offered in a condensed period, separately from a bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;2-year JD program&quot;).

As a result of student concerns about the time and cost (both in terms of tuition and the opportunity cost associated with foregoing a salary for three years) required to complete a law degree, there has been an emerging trend to develop accelerated JD programs.

==Pedagogical methods==
Most law school education in the United States is traditionally based on an approach developed by Christopher Columbus Langdell and James Barr Ames at Harvard Law School during the 1870s. Professors lead in-class debates over the issues in selected court cases, compiled into &quot;casebooks&quot; for each course. Under the Harvard approach, law professors do not deliver lengthy lectures and instead use the Socratic method to force students to teach one another, based on their individual understanding of legal theory and the facts of the case at hand.

Many law schools continue to use the Socratic method—consisting of calling on a student at random, asking about an argument made in an assigned case, asking the student whether they agree with the argument, and then using a series of questions to carefully expose logical flaws in the student&#x27;s analysis of the argument. Examinations usually entail interpreting the facts of a hypothetical case, determining how legal theories apply to the case, and then writing an essay. This process is intended to train students in the reasoning methods necessary to interpret theories, statutes, and precedents correctly, and argue their validity, both orally and in writing. In contrast, most civil law countries base their legal education on professorial lectures and oral examinations, which are more suited for the mastery of complicated civil codes.

This style of teaching is often disorienting to first-year law students who are more accustomed to taking notes from professors&#x27; lectures. Most casebooks do not clearly outline the law; instead, they force the student to interpret the cases and derive the basic legal concepts from the cases themselves. As a result, many publishers market law school outlines that concisely summarize the basic concepts of each area of law, and good outlines are highly sought after by many students, although some professors discourage their use.

Legal pedagogy has also been criticized by scholars like Alan Watson in his book, &quot;The Shame of Legal Education&quot;. Some law schools, such as Savannah Law School, have changed direction and created collaborative learning environments to allow students to work directly with each other and professors in order to model the teamwork of attorneys working on a case.

For purposes of passing state bar examinations, some law school graduates find law school instruction inadequate, and resort to specialized bar review courses from private course providers. These bar reviews typically consist of lectures, often video recorded.

==History==

===Before law schools===

Until the late 19th century, law schools were uncommon in the United States. Most people entered the legal profession through reading law, a form of independent study or apprenticeship, often under the supervision of an experienced attorney. This practice usually consisted of reading classic legal texts, such as Edward Coke&#x27;s &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot; and William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;.

In colonial America law schools did not exist. Within a few years following the American Revolution, some universities such as the College of William and Mary and the University of Pennsylvania established a &quot;Chair in Law&quot;. Columbia College appointed its first Professor of Law, James Kent, in 1793. Those who held these positions were the sole purveyors of legal education (per se) for their institutions—though law was, of course, discussed in other academic areas as a matter of course—and gave lectures designed to supplement, rather than replace, an apprenticeship.

===The first law schools===

The first institution established for the sole purpose of teaching law was the Litchfield Law School, set up by Judge Tapping Reeve in 1784 to organize the large number of would-be apprentices or lecture attendees that he attracted. Despite the success of that institution, and of similar programs set up thereafter at Harvard University (1817), Dickinson College (1834), Yale University (1843), Albany Law School (1851), and Columbia University (1858), law school attendance would remain a rare exception in the profession. Apprenticeship would be the norm until the 1890s, when the American Bar Association (which had been formed in 1878) began pressing states to limit admission to the bar to those who had satisfactorily completed several years of post-graduate instruction. In 1906, the Association of American Law Schools adopted a requirement that law school consist of a three-year course of study.

Another key evolution was from law school as an alternative to undergraduate education to law school as a form of graduate professional education. Before 1870, there was nothing like a modern university in America, only a number of glorified liberal arts colleges which taught Greek, Latin, moral philosophy, and mathematics to undergraduates. The early law departments attached to these purported universities, such as the ones at Harvard and Yale, were in competition for those same undergraduates. Students at the time chose law school or college, but not both. Law schools were technical schools with &quot;second-class status&quot; which usually had lower admissions standards than the colleges they were competing against for undergraduates. For example, in 1904, Hugo Black was denied admission to the University of Alabama&#x27;s Academic Department, the ancestor of its College of Arts and Sciences, but he got into its law school.

===The dominance of Harvard Law School===

Langdell&#x27;s deanship from 1870 to 1895 transformed Harvard Law School into the &quot;preeminent law school&quot; in the United States, created the template for the modern American law school, and also established the modern expectation that &quot;institutionalized legal training&quot; was essential for &quot;leaders of the profession&quot;. From 1870 to 1920, Harvard Law School proceeded &quot;to overwhelm all the others&quot; in every way imaginable, to the point that one critic, Gleason Archer Sr., wrote an entire self-published book harshly attacking Harvard as the &quot;educational octopus&quot; whose tentacles (i.e., Langdell&#x27;s students) reached into every corner of the American legal community.

Langdell turned the law program at Harvard from a disorganized two-year undergraduate program―which undergraduates could wander into at any point―into a carefully structured three-year graduate program leading to a postbaccalaureate degree. It was also Harvard under Langdell which developed the modern concept of the American law professor, starting with the 1873 hiring of Ames: a career academic with limited practice experience &quot;who was appointed for his scholarly and teaching potential&quot;. Before Ames, law school faculty members were either practicing lawyers who did some part-time teaching on the side, or full-time teachers who had moved into academia only after extensive experience practicing law.

Harvard&#x27;s dominance was most rapidly established through the wild popularity of its teaching approach: the casebook method combined with the Socratic method. The transition from traditional lectures to the interactive examination of cases became &quot;the law schools&#x27; apparent passport to academic respectability&quot;. Langdell actually did not invent that approach to teaching law, but it &quot;became known as his by virtue of his determined and systematic application of the approach.&quot; Ames refined the approach further by contributing the ideas that casebooks should focus on cases selected for their &quot;striking facts and vivid opinions&quot;, and group them together by subject. Langdell had simply printed cases chronologically. Finally, Langdell shifted law school examinations from the systematic exposition of rules (before him, students regurgitated legal rules in exam answers in a manner similar to hornbooks) to a problem-solving method tightly focused on the application of legal rules to specific hypothetical fact patterns (which eventually resulted in a common exam response format known as IRAC). It is this choice of Langdell&#x27;s which explains why American law took &quot;the atomistic rather than the unitary approach that distinguishes it from other common-law systems today&quot;.

The genius of the Harvard approach to teaching law was its financial cost-effectiveness: it was &quot;both cheaper and more exciting for both teacher and student&quot;. Law schools could get away with a much higher ratio of students to professors than under the old system, where the professor would first deliver a lecture dryly summarizing a legal topic, and then try to verify whether students had actually absorbed any information through quizzes and recitations. By 1902, 12 of the 92 American law schools then in existence were already using the Harvard approach, and by 1907, that number was over 30.

Langdell&#x27;s vision that law programs ought to be offered only at the graduate level and result in a postbaccalaureate degree took much longer to spread to all other American law schools. As of 1914, only Harvard and Penn were adhering to that principle. By 1921, the law schools at Stanford, Columbia, Western Reserve, and Yale were requiring a college degree for admission, but they also exempted undergraduates enrolled at the same university from that requirement.

The underlying obstacle was that at the turn of the 20th century, public education was still in its infancy in most of the United States—a defect which the country was belatedly struggling to correct in what is now known as the Progressive Era. In most areas, there were simply not enough high school or college graduates to fill a law school entering class. In 1899, Cornell University forced its law school to require a high school diploma for admission, like the rest of the university, and the law school saw the size of its entering class crash from 125 to 62. In 1909, Minnesota started to require a single year of college-level work as a prerequisite for law school admission and saw its entering class drop from 203 to 69.

===Admission of women and people of color===
====Women====

Women were not allowed in most law schools during the late 1800s and the early 1900s. In 1869, two newly opened law schools permitted women to enroll: Washington University School of Law became the first chartered law school in America to admit women, and Howard University School of Law was founded with an open admissions policy accepting Black and White men and women to enroll. The &quot;first woman on record to have received a law degree was Ada Kepley from Union College of Law in Illinois (Northwestern)&quot; in 1870. Some law schools that allowed women before most others were Buffalo Law School which &quot;begun in 1887 ... and open to women and immigrant groups&quot;; University of Iowa College of Law which &quot;admitted women as law students&quot; since at least 1869; University of Michigan Law School; and Boston University School of Law which started admitting women in 1872.

In 1878, two women successfully sued to be admitted to the first class at Hastings Law School, one of whom was Clara S. Foltz. When the University of California established a second law program in 1894, this time on the Berkeley campus, it was open to women and men on an equal basis. Ellen Spencer Mussey and Emma Gillett founded the Washington Law School for women and men in 1898 (now known as, American University Washington College of Law).

The difficulty for women law students was further aggravated by the fact that courts did not allow women to be admitted as lawyers, as demonstrated in the famous case involving Myra Bradwell as the plaintiff in &quot;Bradwell v. Illinois&quot; (1870). The federal courts were subsequently opened to women in 1878 due to a successful campaign by Belva Ann Lockwood. Elite law schools remained closed to women for a while after.

Spurred by the suffragist movement for women, Harvard Law School started considering admitting women in 1899 but without success. Partly in response to the pressures of the suffragist movement and the unwillingness of elite law schools to open their doors, &quot;in 1908, Portia Law School was founded in Boston&quot; which later became the New England School of Law and was the only law school at the time with &quot;an all women student body&quot;. In 1915, due to Harvard&#x27;s continued refusal to admit women, the Cambridge Law School for Women was established as an alternative to elite law schools, and was to be &quot;as nearly as possible a replica of the Harvard Law School as is possible to make it.&quot; World War I encouraged the movement toward admitting women to law schools, and in 1918, Fordham Law School and Yale Law School started admitting women. Northeastern University School of Law, at the time a YMCA institution, started admitting women in 1923. Harvard Law School did not admit women until 1950, and Notre Dame Law School.

Black women faced far greater barriers to entry into law than white women. As of 1940, there were a hundred times as many white women practicing law in the United States as Black women, although the profession remained over 97% white men. At that time, 4,146 white women practiced law (2.3% of all lawyers), along with 1,013 Black men (0.6%), and just 39 Black women in the entire country out of a total of over 177,000.

In spite of advances in admission to elite law schools in the mid-twentieth century, &quot;[i]n 1963, women had comprised only 2.7 percent of the profession. In the academic year 1969–70, only 6.35 percent of the degree candidates at law school were women.&quot; A prevalent attitude has been mentioned several times by Hillary Clinton, who recalled that she had been accepted at Harvard Law School in 1969 but had been repelled by a professor who told her at a student-recruitment party, &quot;we don&#x27;t need any more women at Harvard.&quot; (She went to Yale Law School instead.) Attendance of women at law schools did however improve significantly in the next 10-year period. &quot;In 1968, 3,704 of the 62,000 law students in approved schools were women; by 1979, there were 37,534 women out of 117,279 students in approved schools&quot; although still represented in larger proportions in less elite law schools.

In 2016, the number of women enrolled in ABA-approved law schools reached the majority (50.09%), with female students being 55,766 of the total 111,327. Women enrollees have since outnumbered male enrollees every year. In 2024, the most recent year for which data is available, women made up 56.09 percent of all students in ABA-approved law schools. 17 of the top 20 law schools ranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Colleges Ranking in 2024 had more female than male attendees. Sharply increased from 10 percent in 2000, in 2024, 42 percent of law school deans are also women, according to Rosenblatt&#x27;s Dean Database, 14 percent of whom are black women,

====People of color====
The oldest historically black law school in the United States is Howard University School of Law, part of Howard University, a private, federally chartered historically black research university in Washington, D.C. It is one of the oldest law schools in the country. The legal department, led by John Mercer Langston, opened in 1869 to address &quot;a great need to train lawyers who would have a strong commitment to helping black Americans secure and protect their newly established rights&quot; of the tumultuous Reconstruction era. Howard Law was the first school in the nation to have a non-discriminatory admissions policy. From its founding, it admitted white male and female students along with black students. Still, just eight women graduated from Howard Law during the first 30 years of its existence. Charlotte E. Ray was admitted to Howard&#x27;s law program in 1869 and graduated in 1872, becoming its first black female lawyer. It is reported that Ray applied for admission to the bar using initials for her given and middle names, in order to disguise her gender, because she was &quot;[a]ware of the school&#x27;s reluctant commitment to the principle of sexual equality.&quot;

In 2024, the &quot;percentage&quot; of black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) enrolled in law school increased for the fifth year in a row, from 33.43 percent in 2023 to 36.30 percent in 2024, with BIPOC deans leading one third of law schools in 2024.

==Credentials obtainable while in law school==
Within each U.S. law school, key credentials include:
* Law review/Law journal membership or editorial position (based either on grades or write-on competition or both). This is important for at least three reasons. First, because it is determined by either grades or writing ability, membership is an indicator of strong academic performance. This leads to the second reason, which is that potential employers sometimes use law review membership in their hiring criteria. Third, work on law review exposes a student to legal scholarship and editing, and often allows the student to publish a significant piece of legal scholarship on his or her own. Most law schools have a &quot;flagship&quot; journal usually called &quot;&quot;School name&quot; Law Review&quot; (for example, the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;—although some schools call their flagship journal &quot;&quot;School name&quot; Law Journal&quot;; see &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;) that publishes articles on all areas of law, and one or more other specialty law journals that publish articles concerning only a particular area of the law (for example, the &quot;Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology&quot;).
* Moot court membership or award (based on oral and written argument). Success in moot court can distinguish one as an outstanding oral advocate and provides a degree of practical legal training that is often absent from law review membership. Moot court and related activities, such as Trial Advocacy and Dispute Resolution, may appeal especially to employers hiring for litigation positions, such as a district attorney&#x27;s office.
* Mock trial membership and awards (based on trial level advocacy skills) also can distinguish one as an outstanding trial advocate and help develop &quot;real world&quot; skills that are often valuable to employers hiring for litigation positions.
* Order of the Coif membership (based on grade point average). This is often coupled with Latin honors (summa and magna cum laude, though often not cum laude). However, a slight majority of law schools in the U.S. do not have Order of the Coif chapters.
* Phi Delta Phi honor society membership (based on class ranking of the top one-third). This prestigious society is organized around student chapters called &quot;Inns&quot;, and the society has inducted many historic figures including five U.S. presidents, two U.S. vice presidents, 14 Supreme Court justices, and numerous members of Congress, Cabinet members, and ambassadors. .

===State and federal court clerkship===

On the basis of a student&#x27;s credentials, as well as favorable faculty recommendations, some students obtain a one or two-year clerkship with a judge after graduation. While the majority of judges traditionally choose incoming clerks while they are still in law school, or as they complete another clerkship, in the 2020s; some judges seek out clerks with some private law practice experience.

Clerkships may be with state or federal judges, and are meant to provide the recent law school graduate with experience working for a judge. Often, clerks engage in significant legal research and writing for the judge, writing memos to assist a judge in coming to a legal conclusion in some cases, and writing drafts of opinions based on the judge&#x27;s decisions. Appellate court clerkships, although generally more prestigious, do not necessarily give one a great deal of practical experience in the day-to-day life of a lawyer in private practice. The average litigator might get much more out of a clerkship at the trial court level, where they will be learning about motions practices, dealing with lawyers, and generally learning how a trial court works from the inside.

Court clerkships may also provide other valuable assets to a young lawyer; judges often become mentors to their clerks, providing the fledgling attorney with an experienced individual from whom to seek advice. Fellow clerks may also become enduring connections. Law schools encourage graduates to engage in a clerkship to broaden their professional experiences. However, there fewer clerkships than there are academically eligible graduates.

===United States Supreme Court clerkship===
Some law school graduates are able to clerk for one of the Justices on the Supreme Court (each Justice takes two to four clerks per year). Often, these clerks are graduates of elite law schools, with Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Columbia, the University of Virginia, and Stanford being among the most highly represented schools. Justice Clarence Thomas is the major exception to the rule that Justices hire clerks from elite schools; he takes pride in selecting clerks from non-top-tier schools, and publicly noted that his clerks have been attacked on the Internet as &quot;third tier trash&quot;.

Most Supreme Court clerks have clerked in a lower court, often for a year with a highly selective federal circuit court judge (such as Judges Alex Kozinski, Michael Luttig, J. Harvie Wilkinson, David Tatel, Richard Posner) known as a &quot;feeder judge&quot;. It is perhaps the most highly selective and prestigious position a recently graduated lawyer can have, and Supreme Court clerks are often highly sought after by law firms, the government, and law schools. Law firms give Supreme Court clerks as much as a $400,000 bonus for signing with their firm. The vast majority of Supreme Court clerks either become academics at elite law schools, enter private practice as appellate attorneys, or take highly selective government positions.

==Controversies involving U.S. law schools==

===Employment statistics and salary information===

&quot;After the JD&quot;, a large study of law graduates who passed the bar examination, found that even graduates of lower ranked law schools were typically making six figure ($100,000+) incomes within 12 years after graduation. Graduates of higher ranking schools typically earned more than $170,000. &quot;The Economic Value of a Law Degree&quot;, a peer-reviewed study which included law graduates who did not pass the bar exam and were not practicing law, found that law graduates at the 25th percentile of earnings ability typically earned around $20,000 more every year than they would have earned with only a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Graduates at the 75th percentile earned around $80,000 more per year than they likely would have earned with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. However, only around 60 to 70 percent of law graduates practice law. Some authors have criticized employment information supplied directly by law schools; however, these studies report information supplied directly by law graduates, and in the case of the latter study, collected by the United States Census Bureau as part of a broader economic survey.

===&quot;The New York Times&quot; negative press coverage===
Starting in 2011, American law schools became the subject of a series of critical articles in mainstream news publications, starting with a series of &quot;The New York Times&quot; articles by David Segal. (The newspaper had also published similarly critical reportage during previous decades.) During the 2010s, such articles have reported on the debt loads of law graduates, the difficulty of securing employment in the legal profession, and insufficient practical training at American law schools. A number of critics have pointed out factual inaccuracies and logical errors in &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ higher education coverage, especially related to law schools.

More recent press coverage by some higher education reporters has noted that peer-reviewed studies and comprehensive data suggests that law graduates are still typically better off financially than they would be had they not attended law school, notwithstanding challenges facing recent graduates.

===Lawsuits related to American legal education===

In 2011, several law schools were sued for fraud and for misleading job placement statistics. Most of these suits have been dismissed on the merits.

In 1995, the United States Department of Justice sued the American Bar Association, the accrediting body of American law schools, for allegedly violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. The settlement of the suit prohibited the ABA from using salary of faculty or administrators as an accreditation criterion.

===Political balance===

Liberal professors have claimed that there is conservative bias in law schools, particularly within law and economics and business law fields. Liberals have also argued for affirmative action to increase the representation of women and minorities among law students and law faculty.

Conservative students have argued that there is a liberal bias among top tier law faculty.

===Sexist text message campaign of 2024===
During 2024, female law students, professors and deans across the nation received anonymous text messages complaining that women are outperforming men at law schools on their personal cellphones, stating such as &quot;Law school isn&#x27;t fair for us men&quot;, sparking an FBI investigation.

===Alaska===

As of 2024, Alaska remains the only state without a law school. Although some state lawmakers have called for the University of Alaska to establish a law school, a 2004 study commissioned for the University of Alaska Anchorage found little economic justification for this and instead recommended that the state &quot;should begin with a grant or incentive program for law students attending school outside [Alaska]&quot;, and to &quot;develop partnerships with ABA accredited law schools to deliver summer programs and externships in Alaska.&quot;

==Law school rankings==
There are several different law school rankings, each with a different emphasis and different methodology. Most either emphasize inputs or readily measurable outcomes (i.e., outcomes shortly after graduation); none measure value-added or long-term outcomes. In general, these rankings are controversial, not universally accepted as authoritative.

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s regularly publishes a list of the &quot;Top 100 Law Schools&quot; based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, e.g., entering student LSAT scores and GPAs, reputation surveys, expenditures per student, etc. &quot;U.S. News&quot; ratings heavily emphasize inputs—student test scores and grades, law school expenditures—but includes some outcomes such as bar passage and employment shortly after graduation. &quot;U.S. News&quot; rankings are heavily weighted toward &quot;reputation&quot;, which is measured through a survey with small sample size and low response rates. The reputation scores are highly correlated with the previous years&#x27; reputation scores and may not reflect changes in law school quality over time.

The Social Science Research Network—a repository for draft and completed scholarship in law and the social sciences—publishes monthly rankings of law schools based on the number of times faculty members&#x27; scholarship was downloaded. Rankings are available by total number of downloads, total number of downloads within the last 12 months, and downloads per faculty member to adjust for the size of different institutions. SSRN also provides rankings of individual law school faculty members on these metrics.

Brian Leiter compiles a regular series of evaluations called &quot;Brian Leiter&#x27;s Law School Reports&quot; in which he and other commentators discuss law schools. Leiter&#x27;s rankings tend to emphasize the quality and quantity of faculty scholarship, as measured by citations in a select group of journals.

Several other ranking systems are explicitly designed to focus on employment outcomes at or shortly after graduation, including rankings by the National Law Journal, Vault.com and Above the Law. &quot;The National Law Journal&quot; provides a comparison of its employment-based rankings to &quot;U.S. News&quot; rankings. For students who are primarily interested in lucrative employment outcomes rather than scholarly prestige, this comparison may suggest which law schools are most undervalued by the market.

===Top 14 law schools===
The &quot;Top Fourteen&quot; or &quot;T14&quot; are common, colloquial references to the 14 institutions historically listed as the top 14 American law schools by the annual &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges Ranking&quot;; &quot;T14&quot; schools are also traditionally the only ones to have ever placed within the top 10 spots of the rankings. Although &quot;T14&quot; is not a designation used by &quot;U.S. News&quot; itself, the term is &quot;widely known in the legal community&quot;. While these schools have seen their position within the top 14 spots shift frequently, they have generally not placed outside of the top 14 since the inception of the rankings. There have been rare exceptions: Texas and UCLA appeared in the 1987 list, before the start of the annual rankings (ahead of Northwestern and Cornell); Texas and UCLA displaced Georgetown in 2018 and 2022, respectively. Because of their relatively consistent placement at the top of these rankings, the schools that have taken the annual top spots since 1990 are commonly referred to as the &quot;Top Fourteen&quot; by published books on law school admissions, undergraduate university pre-law advisers, professional law school consultants, and newspaper articles on the subject.

Those 14 schools, alphabetically, are: Berkeley, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Duke, Georgetown, Harvard, Michigan, New York University, Northwestern, Penn, Stanford, Virginia, and Yale.

One study suggests that, after controlling for students&#x27; incoming credentials, earnings and employment outcomes are better at lower ranked ABA approved law schools than at higher ranked law schools—that is, lower ranked law schools may do more to improve outcomes than higher ranked schools.

===Regional tiers and lower-tier national schools===
Most law schools outside the top tier are more regional in scope and often have very strong regional connections to these post-graduation opportunities. For example, a student graduating from a lower-tier law school may find opportunities in that school&#x27;s &quot;home market&quot;: the legal market containing many of that school&#x27;s alumni, where most of the school&#x27;s networking and career development energies are focused. In contrast, an upper-tier law school may find employment opportunities in a broader geographic region.

===State-authorized schools===
Many schools are authorized or accredited by a state and some have been in continuous operation for over 95 years. Most are located in Alabama, California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and in Puerto Rico. Some state authorized law schools are maintained to offer a non-ABA option, experimenting with lower cost options.

Graduates of non-ABA approved law schools have much lower bar passage rates than same-race graduates of ABA-approved law schools in the same state.

===Unaccredited schools===
Some schools are not accredited by a state or the American Bar Association. Most are located in California. Such schools in California are registered and licensed to operate by The State Bar of California Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE), but are not accredited by the CBE. Their first year students are required to take the First-Year Law Students&#x27; Examination (FYLSE), also known as the (&quot;baby bar&quot;), which then authorizes continuing their legal studies. Graduates of non-ABA accredited schools may then take the California Bar Examination. After passing the Bar, they are then licensed to practice law in California. Many other jurisdictions do not allow graduates of unaccredited law schools to sit for their state bar examination. In California, graduates of non-ABA approved law schools have much lower bar passage rates than same-race graduates of ABA-approved law schools in the same state.

(Canada) won the gold medal, Christian Brothers College (United States) the silver, and St. Rose Parish (United States) the bronze. These results are the best that either Canada or the United States have achieved in men&#x27;s Olympic football. The 1904 contest is considered to be an official contest by IOC, although not by FIFA because no national teams were involved in the competition.

According to a report in the Toronto &quot;Mail and Empire&quot; newspaper of November 18, 1904, medals were awarded to the players in St. Louis.
The report states that &quot;Immediately after the game, the Galt aggregation, numbering about 50 persons, retired to the office of James E. Sullivan, chief of the Department of Physical Culture, where they received their prize. After a talk by Mr. James A. Conlon, of the Physical Culture Department, Mayor Mundy, of the City of Galt, presented each player on the winning team with a beautiful gold medal.&quot;
The medal awarded to Fred Steep of Galt, held by The Soccer Hall of Fame and Museum in Vaughan, Ontario, clearly shows that the medals were made in St. Louis, Missouri.

<text>Romance tours are tours that men take in search of a relationship, girlfriend or even a marriage. In some such tours, the men and potential brides interact in brief parties arranged by the hosting company.

A large number of romance tours take place every year throughout the world. Romance tours first began in Russia and CIS, but have recently moved into other parts of the world such as South America. Tours also take place in many parts of Asia. 

Once couples have met on a romance tour, an agency arranges &quot;one on one&quot; dates between the man and the women he found most compatible. The ultimate goal of the tour is for the man to find a compatible wife.

Romance tours are just one part of the mail-order bride business, which may also include catalogs, CD-ROMs and the Internet. The traditional romance tour, seen by some as superficial, is being somewhat replaced by the internet as technology evolves. However, the two are closely linked as a man eventually has to meet his prospective wife using a well-organized method of meeting and dating.

Romance tours should not be confused with sex tourism, because the ultimate goal of a sex tourist is usually not marriage.

<doc id="219544" wikidata="Q205011" url="?curid=219544" title="Junk (ship)">
<text>A junk () is a type of Chinese sailing ship characterized by a central rudder, an overhanging flat transom, watertight bulkheads, and a flat-bottomed design. They are also characteristically built using iron nails and clamps. The term applies to many types of small coastal or river ships, usually serving as cargo ships, pleasure boats, or houseboats, but also going up in size up to large ocean-going vessels. There can be significant regional variations in the type of rig and the layout of the vessel.

Chinese junks were originally only fluvial and had square sails, but by the Song dynasty (), they adopted ocean-going technologies acquired from Southeast Asian &quot;k&#x27;un-lun po&quot; trade ships. Tanja sails and fully-battened junk rigs were introduced to Chinese junks by the 12th century CE.

Similar designs to the Chinese junk were also adopted by other East Asian countries, most notably Japan, where junks were used as merchant ships to trade goods with China and Southeast Asia. 

==Etymology and history of the term==
The English word &quot;junk&quot; comes from Portuguese from Malay . The word originally referred to the Javanese djong, very large trading ships that the Portuguese first encountered in Southeast Asia. It later also included the smaller flat-bottomed Chinese &quot;chuán&quot;, even though the two were markedly different vessels. After the disappearance of the jong in the 17th century, the meaning of &quot;junk&quot; (and other similar words in European languages) came to refer exclusively to the Chinese ship.

The Chinese &quot;chuán&quot; and the Southeast Asian djong are frequently confused with each other and share some characteristics, including large cargo capacities, multiple (two to three) superimposed layers of hull planks, and multiple masts and sails. However the two are readily distinguishable from each other by two major differences. The first is that Southeast Asian (Austronesian) ships are built exclusively with lugs, dowels, and fiber lashings (lashed lug), in contrast to Chinese ships which are always built with iron nails and clamps. The second is that Chinese ships since the first century AD are all built with a central rudder. In contrast, Southeast Asian ships use double lateral rudders.

The development of the sea-going Chinese &quot;chuán&quot; (the &quot;junk&quot; in modern usage) in the Song dynasty () is believed to have been influenced by regular contacts with sea-going Southeast Asian ships (the &quot;k&#x27;un-lun po&quot; of Chinese records) in trading ports in southern China from the 1st millennium CE onward, particularly in terms of the rigging, multiple sails, and the multiple hull sheaths. However, the &quot;chuán&quot; also incorporates distinctly Chinese innovations from their indigenous river and coastal vessels (namely watertight compartments and the central rudders). &quot;Hybrid&quot; ships (referred to as the &quot;South China Sea tradition&quot;) integrating technologies from both the &quot;chuán&quot; and the djong also started to appear by the 15th century.

== Construction ==
=== Sails ===


Iconographic remains show that Chinese ships before the 12th century used square sails. A ship carving from a stone Buddhist stele shows a ship with square sail from the Liu Sung dynasty or the Liang dynasty (c. 5th or 6th century). Dunhuang cave temple no. 45 (from the 8th or 9th century) features large sailboats and sampans with inflated square sails. A wide ship with a single sail is depicted in the Xi&#x27;an mirror (after the 9th or 12th century). Eastern lug sail, which used battens and is commonly known as &quot;junk rig&quot;, was likely not Chinese in origin: The oldest depiction of a battened junk sail comes from the Bayon temple at Angkor Thom, Cambodia. From its characteristics and location, it is likely that the ship depicted in Bayon was a Southeast Asian ship. The Chinese themselves may have adopted them around the 12th century CE.

The full-length battens of the junk sail keep the sail flatter than ideal in all wind conditions. Consequently, their ability to sail close to the wind is poorer than other fore-and-aft rigs.

=== Hull ===

Unlike other major shipbuilding traditions which developed from dugout canoes, the junk evolved from tapering rafts. It is the reason for the unique characteristics of early Chinese junks, like the absence of keels, very low decks, and solid transverse bulkheads rather than ribs or internal frames.

Classic junks were built of softwoods (although after the 17th century teak was used in Guangdong) with the outside shape built first. Then multiple internal compartment/bulkheads accessed by separate hatches and ladders, reminiscent of the interior structure of bamboo, were built in. Traditionally, the hull has a horseshoe-shaped stern supporting a high poop deck. The bottom is flat in a river junk with no keel (similar to a sampan), so that the boat relies on a daggerboard, leeboard or very large rudder to prevent the boat from slipping sideways in the water.

The internal bulkheads are characteristic of junks, providing interior compartments and strengthening the ship. They also controlled flooding in case of holing. Ships built in this manner were written of in Zhu Yu&#x27;s book &quot;Pingzhou Table Talks&quot;, published by 1119 during the Song dynasty. Again, this type of construction for Chinese ship hulls was attested to by the Moroccan Muslim Berber traveler Ibn Battuta (1304–1377 CE), who described it in great detail (refer to Technology of the Song dynasty).

Benjamin Franklin wrote in a 1787 letter on the project of mail packets between the United States and France:

Similar wet wells were also apparent in Roman small craft of the 5th century CE.

=== Leeboards and centerboards ===

Other innovations included the square-pallet bilge pump, which was adopted by the West during the 16th century for work ashore, the western chain pump, which was adopted for shipboard use, being of a different derivation. Junks also relied on the compass for navigational purposes. However, as with almost all vessels of any culture before the late 19th century, the accuracy of magnetic compasses aboard ship, whether from a failure to understand deviation (the magnetism of the ship&#x27;s iron fastenings) or poor design of the compass card (the standard drypoint compasses were extremely unstable), meant that they did little to contribute to the accuracy of navigation by dead reckoning. Review of the evidence shows that the Chinese embarked magnetic pointer was only sometimes used for navigation or reorientation. The reasoning is simple. Chinese mariners were as capable as any, having undertaken the journey safely for hundreds of years, had they needed a compass as an essential tool to navigate, they would have been aware of the almost random directional qualities when used at sea of the water bowl compass they used. Yet that design remained unchanged for some half a millennium. Western sailors, coming upon a similar water bowl design (no evidence as to how has yet emerged) very rapidly adapted it in a series of significant changes such that within roughly a century the water bowl had given way to the dry pivot, a rotating compass card a century later, a lubberline a generation later and gimbals seventy or eighty years after that.

=== Steering ===

Junks employed stern-mounted rudders centuries before their adoption in the West for the simple reason that Western hull forms, with their pointed sterns, obviated a centreline steering system until technical developments in Scandinavia created the first, iron mounted, pintle and gudgeon &#x27;barn door&#x27; western examples in the early 12th century CE. A second reason for this slow development was that the side rudders in use were still extremely efficient. Thus the junk rudder&#x27;s origin, form and construction was completely different in that it was the development of a centrally mounted stern steering oar, examples of which can also be seen in Middle Kingdom (c. 2050–1800 BCE) Egyptian river vessels. It was an innovation which permitted the steering of large ships and due to its design allowed height adjustment according to the depth of the water and to avoid serious damage should the junk ground. A sizable junk can have a rudder that needed up to twenty members of the crew to control in strong weather. In addition to using the sail plan to balance the junk and take the strain off the hard to operate and mechanically weakly attached rudder, some junks were also equipped with leeboards or dagger boards. The world&#x27;s oldest known depiction of a stern-mounted rudder can be seen on a pottery model of a junk dating from before the 1st century CE.

==History==

=== Han to Northern and southern dynasties era (2nd–6th century) ===
Chinese ships at this time were essentially fluvial (riverine) in nature and operation. Chinese ships weren&#x27;t used for maritime voyages to Southeast Asia and beyond until the 9th century CE. Heng suggests an even later date (11th century CE) for the beginning of Chinese maritime shipping, when the first actual records of Chinese ships (mostly from Fujian and Guangdong) leaving for foreign trade appear.

Large Austronesian trading ships docking in Chinese seaports with as many as four sails were recorded by scholars as early as the 3rd century CE. They called them the &quot;kunlun bo&quot; or &quot;kunlun po&quot; (). They were described as being capable of sailing against strong winds and violent waves, implying that Chinese ships at that time did not have that capacity. These ships were booked by Chinese Buddhist pilgrims for passage to Southern India and Sri Lanka. In the 3rd century CE, Chinese envoys were also sent to Southeast Asia (&quot;Nanhai&quot;), all of them explicitly used foreign ships for passage.

=== Sui to Tang dynasty (7th century–9th century) ===
In 683 CE, Tang court sent an envoy to Srivijaya, which does not mention a ship or even a mission, implying that like in previous cases, the envoy booked passage in a foreign ship. Wang (1958) stated that there are no Tang dynasty records that mentioned Chinese junks being used for trading with Southeast Asia. &quot;Kunlun bo&quot; trade increased by the 9th century, and were described as arriving regularly in trading ports in southern China in Chinese records.

Around 770 CE, there was great activity in canal and river boat construction, attributed to Liu Yen, who created 10 shipwright yards and provided competitive rewards. Chu LingYiin, for example, deployed many-decked naval vessels in the Wu Tai Battle of 934 AD.

=== Rise of Song dynasty (10th–13th century) ===
The state of Wuyue established diplomatic and maritime trade relations with Japan and the Korean states since at least 935 CE until Wuyue was absorbed by the Song dynasty in 978 CE. The relations of Wuyue with Japan and Korea were primarily motivated by Buddhism.

In 989 CE, the Song court permitted private Chinese ships to trade overseas, due to the loss of access to the northern trading routes along the Silk Road. However regulations required ships to depart and return at specific ports that they were registered to, which stifled early trade. This regulation was modified in 1090, when the Song court decreed that ships could freely register and depart from any port. The first records of Chinese ships leaving for trade abroad appear in the 11th century, mostly to Southeast Asia, but also included records of trade with Japan and the Korean states. A stipulation requiring ships to return within 9 months was added by the second half of the 11th century, which limited the range of Chinese vessels.

Needham&#x27;s &quot;Science and Civilisation in China&quot; provided some descriptions of the large junk ship during the Song dynasty. Chin scholar in 1190 described the ships in the form of a poem:

&quot;Through the streets carts and horses are rumbling and thronging-We are back in a year of the Hsüan-Ho reign-period. One day a Han-Lin scholar presented this painting, Worthy of handing down the ways and works of a peaceful time. Going east from the Water-gate one comes to the Canal of the Sui, The streets and the fields are alike incomparable (But Lao Tzu formerly warned against prosperity And today we know it has all become waste-land). Yet the vessels that sail ten thousand li on their voyages. With rudders of timber from Chhu and their masts from Wu, Fine scenery north of the bridge and south of the bridge, Recall for a time the dream of halcyon days, One can hear the flutes and drums; the towers seem close at hand.&quot;

A decade before, in 1178, the Guangzhou customs officer Zhou Qufei wrote in &quot;Lingwai Daida&quot; about the sea-going ships of Southern China again:

&quot;The ships which sail the southern sea and south of it are like giant houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year&#x27;s supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine is fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no going back to the mainland when once the people have set forth upon the cerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board, everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say &quot;To make such and such a country, with a favorable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction&quot;. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow for the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.&quot;

In 1274 CE, according to a resident of Hangzhou, the large Song junks were of 5,000 &quot;liao&quot;, around , and could fit up to 600 passengers; the middle sized ships were between 1,000- 2,000 &quot;liao&quot; and could carry up to 300 passengers. Smaller ships were known as &quot;wind-piercing&quot; and carried up to a hundred passengers. However, historical descriptions (often second-hand) in early Chinese sources tend to greatly exaggerate dimensions, usually to twice or more of the actual lengths. Shipwrecks of large junks of the period, the Nanhai one and Quanzhou ship, measured and in length, respectively.

=== Yuan dynasty (14th century) ===

The Mongol Yuan dynasty initially lifted the 9-month restriction on maritime shipping at around 1279, resulting in Chinese trade ships displacing Southeast Asian ships in their traditional Indian Ocean routes. But by 1284, the Yuan court revoked the private trade policy of the Song dynasty, and much of the Chinese maritime trade during this period was monopolized by the state via &quot;ortogh&quot; partnerships. Most trade expeditions were controlled by foreign merchants, mainly Muslims living in trading cities in southern China, partnered with government officials and the Mongol imperial family. This ban on private trade was intermittently lifted for brief periods until 1323, when it was lifted permanently until the overthrow of the Yuan.

Chinese ships were also described by Western travelers to the east, such as Ibn Battuta. According to Ibn Battuta, who visited China in 1347:…We stopped in the port of Calicut, in which there were at the time thirteen Chinese vessels, and disembarked. On the China Sea traveling is done in Chinese ships only, so we shall describe their arrangements. The Chinese vessels are of three kinds; large ships called chunks &quot;(junks)&quot;, middle sized ones called zaws &quot;(dhows)&quot; and the small ones kakams. The large ships have anything from twelve down to three sails, which are made of bamboo rods plaited into mats. They are never lowered, but turned according to the direction of the wind; at anchor they are left floating in the wind. A ship carries a complement of a thousand men, six hundred of whom are sailors and four hundred men-at-arms, including archers, men with shields and crossbows, who throw naphtha. Three smaller ones, the &quot;half&quot;, the &quot;third&quot; and the &quot;quarter&quot;, accompany each large vessel. These vessels are built in the towns of Zaytun (Quanzhou) and Sin-Kalan (Guangzhou). The vessel has four decks and contains rooms, cabins, and saloons for merchants; a cabin has chambers and a lavatory, and can be locked by its occupants. This is the manner after which they are made; two &quot;(parallel)&quot; walls of very thick wooden &quot;(planking)&quot; are raised and across the space between them are placed very thick planks &quot;(the bulkheads)&quot; secured longitudinally and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built the lower deck is fitted in and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished.&lt;br&gt; —Ibn Battuta

Yuan dynasty ships carry on the tradition of Song; the Yuan navy is essentially Song navy. Both Song and Yuan employed large trading junks. Unlike Ming treasure ships, Song and Yuan great junks are propelled by oars, and have with them smaller junks, probably for maneuvering aids. The largest junks (5,000 &quot;liao&quot;) may have a hull length twice that of Quanzhou ship (1,000 &quot;liao&quot;), that is . However, the norm size for trading junks pre-1500 was most likely around long, with the length of only becoming the norm after 1500 CE. Large size could be a disadvantage for shallow harbors and many reefs of southeast asian.

The ships of the previous Song, both mercantile and military, became the backbone of the Yuan navy. In particular the failed Mongol invasions of Japan (1274–1281), as well as the failed Mongol invasion of Java (1293), essentially relied on recently acquired Song naval capabilities. Worcester estimates that the large Yuan junks were in width and over long. In general, they had no keel, stempost, or sternpost. They did have centreboards, and a watertight bulkhead to strengthen the hull, which added great weight. This type of vessel may have been common in the 13th century. The kind of ships the Mongols used for the invasion wasn&#x27;t recorded but it was large as they commissioned smaller boats for rivers of Java. David Bade estimated around 50 soldiers each on 400-500 ships with their supplies, weapons and diplomats during the Java campaign, while John Man estimated around 29–44 soldiers each.

=== Ming dynasty (15th–17th century) ===

====Expedition of Zheng He====

The largest junks ever built were possibly those of Admiral Zheng He, for his expeditions in the Indian Ocean (1405 to 1433), although this is disputed as no contemporary records of the sizes of Zheng He&#x27;s ships are known. Instead the dimensions are based on &quot;Sanbao Taijian Xia Xiyang Ji Tongsu Yanyi&quot; (&quot;Eunuch Sanbao Western Records Popular Romance&quot;, published 1597), a romanticized version of the voyages written by nearly two centuries later. Maodeng&#x27;s novel describes Zheng He&#x27;s ships as follows:

* &quot;Treasure ships&quot; () nine-masted, 44.4 by 18 &quot;zhang&quot;, about long and wide.
* Equine ships (), carrying horses and tribute goods and repair material for the fleet, eight-masted, 37 by 15 &quot;zhang&quot;, about long and wide.

Louise Levathes suggests that the actual length of the biggest treasure ships may have been between long and wide. Modern scholars have argued on engineering grounds that it is highly unlikely that Zheng He&#x27;s ship was 450 ft in length, Guan Jincheng (1947) proposed a much more modest size of 20 zhang long by 2.4 zhang wide (204 ft by 25.5 ft or 62.2 m by 7.8 m) while Xin Yuan&#x27;ou (2002) put them as 61–76 m (200–250 feet) in length. Zhao Zhigang claimed that he has solved the debate of the size difference, and stated that Zheng He&#x27;s largest ship was about in length.

Comparing to other Ming records, the Chinese seem to have exaggerated their dimensions. European East Indiamen and galleons were said to be 30, 40, 50, and 60 &quot;zhang&quot; (90, 120, 150, and 180 m) in length. It was not until the mid to late 19th century that the length of the largest western wooden ship began to exceed 100 meters, even this was done using modern industrial tools and iron parts.

==== International Commerce ====
In &quot;Livro de Duarte Barbosa&quot; (), the Portuguese writer Duarte Barbosa described the Chinese as &quot;great navigators in very large ships which they call jungos, of two masts, of a different make from ours, the sails are of matting, and so also the cordage. There are great corsairs and robbers amongst those islands and ports of China. They go with all these goods to Malacca, where they also carry much iron, saltpetre and many other things, and for the return voyage they ship there Sumatra and Malabar pepper, of which they use a great deal in China, and drugs of Cambay, much anfiam, which we call opium, and wormwood, Levant gall nuts, saffron, coral wrought and unwrought, stuffs from Cambay, Palecate, and Bengal, vermilion, quicksilver, scarlet cloth, and many other things... Many of these Chinese take their wives and children continually on the ships in which they live without possessing any other dwellings.&quot;

==== Sea ban ====

Private trade was banned in 1371 by the Hongwu Emperor, though official state-sponsored trade under the guise of &quot;tribute&quot; missions continued. The ban on private trade was lifted in 1405 during the Zheng He expeditions, but reinstated again in 1479. From the mid-15th to early 16th century, all Chinese maritime trading was banned under the Ming dynasty in what were known as the &quot;hai jin&quot; laws. The Zheng He expeditions had drained imperial funds and there was increasing threat of invasion from the north, leading the Xuande Emperor to order the immediate cessation of all overseas exploration. The shipping and shipbuilding knowledge acquired during the Song and Yuan dynasties gradually declined during this period.

=== Capture of Taiwan ===
In 1661, a naval fleet of 400 junks and 25,000 men led by the Ming loyalist Koxinga (), arrived in Taiwan to oust the Dutch from Zeelandia. Following a nine-month siege, Cheng captured the Dutch fortress Fort Zeelandia. A peace treaty between Koxinga and the Dutch Government was signed at Castle Zeelandia on February 1, 1662, and Taiwan became Koxinga&#x27;s base for the Kingdom of Tungning.

=== Qing dynasty (17th-19th century) ===
Large, ocean-going junks played a key role in Asian trade until the 19th century. One of these junks, &quot;Keying&quot;, sailed from China around the Cape of Good Hope to the United States and England between 1846 and 1848. Many junks were fitted out with carronades and other weapons for naval or piratical uses. These vessels were typically called &quot;war junks&quot; or &quot;armed junks&quot; by Western navies which began entering the region more frequently in the 18th century. The British, Americans and French fought several naval battles with war junks in the 19th century, during the First Opium War, Second Opium War and in between.

At sea, junk sailors co-operated with their Western counterparts. For example, in 1870 survivors of the English barque &quot;Humberstone&quot; shipwrecked off Formosa, were rescued by a junk and landed safely in Macao.

===Modern period (20th century)===

In 1938, E. Allen Petersen escaped the advancing Japanese armies by sailing a junk, &quot;Hummel Hummel&quot;, from Shanghai to California with his wife Tani and two White Russians (Tsar loyalists).

In 1955, six young men sailed a Ming dynasty-style junk from Taiwan to San Francisco. The four-month journey aboard the &quot;Free China&quot; was captured on film and their arrival into San Francisco made international front-page news. The five Chinese-born friends saw an advertisement for an international trans-Atlantic yacht race, and jumped at the opportunity for adventure. They were joined by the then US Vice-Consul to China, who was tasked with capturing the journey on film. Enduring typhoons and mishaps, the crew, having never sailed a century-old junk before, learned along the way. The crew included Reno Chen, Paul Chow, Loo-chi Hu, Benny Hsu, Calvin Mehlert and were led by skipper Marco Chung. After a journey of , the &quot;Free China&quot; and her crew arrived in San Francisco Bay in fog on August 8, 1955. Shortly afterward the footage was featured on ABC television&#x27;s &quot;Bold Journey&quot; travelogue. Hosted by John Stephenson and narrated by ship&#x27;s navigator Paul Chow, the program highlighted the adventures and challenges of the junk&#x27;s sailing across the Pacific, as well as some humorous moments aboard ship.
In 1959 a group of Catalan men, led by Jose Maria Tey, sailed from Hong Kong to Barcelona on a junk named &quot;Rubia&quot;. After their successful journey this junk was anchored as a tourist attraction at one end of Barcelona harbor, close to where La Rambla meets the sea. Permanently moored along with it was a reproduction of Columbus&#x27; caravel &quot;Santa Maria&quot; during the 1960s and part of the 1970s.

In 1981, Christoph Swoboda had a 65 feet (LoA) &quot;Bedar&quot; built by the boatyard of Che Ali bin Ngah on Duyong island in the estuary of the Terengganu river on the east coast of Malaysia. The Bedar is one of the two types of Malay junk schooners traditionally built there. He sailed this junk with his family and one friend to the Mediterranean and then continued with changing crew to finally finish a circumnavigation in 1998. He sold this vessel in 2000 and in 2004 he started to build a new junk in Duyong with the same craftsmen, the Pinas (or Pinis) Naga Pelangi, in order to help keep this ancient boat building tradition alive. This boat finished to be fitted out in 2010 and is working as a charter boat in the Andaman and the South China Sea.

<text>Rapeseed (Brassica napus&quot; subsp. &quot;napus), also known as rape and oilseed rape, is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family), cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed, which naturally contains appreciable amounts of mildly toxic erucic acid. The term &quot;canola&quot; denotes a group of rapeseed cultivars that were bred to have very low levels of erucic acid and which are especially prized for use as human and animal food. Rapeseed is the third-largest source of vegetable oil and the second-largest source of protein meal in the world.

== Description ==


&quot;Brassica napus&quot; grows to in height with hairless, fleshy, pinnatifid and glaucous lower leaves which are stalked whereas the upper leaves have no petioles.

Rapeseed flowers are bright yellow and about across. They are radial and consist of four petals in a typical cross-form, alternating with four sepals. They have indeterminate racemose flowering starting at the lowest bud and growing upward in the following days. The flowers have two lateral stamens with short filaments, and four median stamens with longer filaments whose anthers split away from the flower&#x27;s center upon flowering.

The rapeseed pods are green and elongated siliquae during development that eventually ripen to brown. They grow on pedicels long, and can range from in length. Each pod has two compartments separated by an inner central wall within which a row of seeds develops. The seeds are round and have a diameter of . They have a reticulate surface texture, and are black and hard at maturity.

=== Similar species ===
&quot;B. napus&quot; can be distinguished from &quot;B. nigra&quot; by the upper leaves which do not clasp the stem, and from &quot;B. rapa&quot; by its smaller petals which are less than across.

== Taxonomy ==
The species &quot;Brassica napus&quot; belongs to the flowering plant family Brassicaceae. Rapeseed is a subspecies with the autonym &quot;B. napus&quot; subsp. &quot;napus&quot;. It encompasses winter and spring oilseed, vegetable and fodder rape. Siberian kale is a distinct leaf rape form variety (&quot;B. napus&quot; var. &quot;pabularia&quot;) which used to be common as a winter-annual vegetable. The second subspecies of &quot;B. napus&quot; is &quot;B. napus &quot;subsp.&quot; rapifera&quot; (also subsp. &quot;napobrassica&quot;; the rutabaga, swede, or yellow turnip).

&quot;B. napus&quot; is a digenomic amphidiploid that occurred due to the interspecific hybridization between &quot;B. oleracea&quot; and &quot;B. rapa&quot;. It is a self-compatible pollinating species like the other amphidiploid &quot;Brassica&quot; species.

=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;rape&quot; derives from the Latin word for turnip, or , cognate with the Greek word , .

== Ecology ==
In Northern Ireland, &quot;B. napus&quot; and &quot;B. rapa&quot; are recorded as escapes in roadside verges and waste ground.

== Cultivation ==
Crops from the genus &quot;Brassica&quot;, including rapeseed, were among the earliest plants to be widely cultivated by humankind as early as 10,000 years ago. Rapeseed was being cultivated in India as early as 4000 B.C. and it spread to China and Japan 2000 years ago.

Rapeseed oil is predominantly cultivated in its winter form in most of Europe and Asia due to the requirement of vernalization to start the process of flowering. It is sown in autumn and remains in a leaf rosette on the soil surface during the winter. The plant grows a long vertical stem in the next spring followed by lateral branch development. It generally flowers in late spring with the process of pod development and ripening occurring over a period of 6–8 weeks until midsummer.

In Europe, winter rapeseed is grown as an annual break crop in three to four-year rotations with cereals such as wheat and barley, and break crops such as peas and beans. This is done to reduce the possibility of pests and diseases being carried over from one crop to another. Winter rape is less susceptible to crop failure as it is more vigorous than the summer variety and can compensate for damage done by pests.
Spring rapeseed is cultivated in Canada, northern Europe and Australia as it is not winter-hardy and does not require vernalization. The crop is sown in spring with stem development happening immediately after germination.

Rapeseed can be cultivated on a wide variety of well-drained soils, prefers a pH between 5.5 and 8.3 and has a moderate tolerance of soil salinity. It is predominantly a wind-pollinated plant but shows significantly increased grain yields when bee-pollinated, almost double the final yield but the effect is cultivar dependent. It is currently grown with high levels of nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and the manufacture of these generates N2O. An estimated 3–5% of nitrogen provided as fertilizer for rapeseed is converted to N2O.

Rapeseed has a high demand for nutrients - in particular, its sulphur demand is the highest among all arable crops. Since the decrease of atmospheric sulphur inputs during the 1980s sulphur fertilization has become a standard measure in oilseed rape production. Among the micronutrients, special attention in rapeseed cultivation has to be given to boron, manganese and molybdenum.

=== Climate change ===

The cultivatable range for rapeseed is expected to decrease due to climate change. The quality of the crop, in both yield and volume of oil, is also expected to decrease substantially. Some researchers recommend finding alternative varieties of &quot;Brassica&quot; for cultivation.

=== Diseases ===
The main diseases of the winter rapeseed crop are canker, light leaf spot (&quot;Pyrenopeziza brassicae&quot;), &quot;alternaria-&quot; and &quot;sclerotinia-&quot; stem rots. Canker causes leaf spotting, and premature ripening and weakening of the stem during the autumn-winter (fall-winter) period. A conazole- or triazole- fungicide treatment is required in late autumn (fall) and in spring against canker while broad-spectrum fungicides are used during the spring-summer period for alternaria and sclerotinia control. Oilseed rape cannot be planted in close rotation with itself due to soil-borne diseases such as sclerotinia, verticillium wilt and clubroot.

Transgenic rapeseed shows great promise for . Transexpression of a class II chitinase from barley (&quot;Hordeum vulgare&quot;) and a type I ribosome inactivating protein into &quot;B. juncea&quot; produces a large . Chhikara &quot;et al.&quot;, 2012 finds that this combination of transgenes reduces hyphal growth by 44% and delays disease presentation in &quot;Alternaria brassicicola&quot; of &quot;juncea&quot;.

Blackleg (&quot;Leptosphaeria maculans&quot;/&quot;Phoma lingam&quot;) is a major disease. Yu &quot;et al.&quot;, 2005 uses restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on two doubled haploid populations DHP95 and DHP96. They find one resistance genes in each, &quot;&quot; and &quot;LepR1&quot;.

=== Pests ===
Rapeseed is attacked by a wide variety of insects, , as well as wood pigeons. The brassica pod midge (&quot;Dasineura brassicae&quot;), cabbage seed weevil (&quot;Ceutorhynchus assimilis&quot;), cabbage stem weevil (&quot;Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus&quot;), cabbage stem flea beetle (&quot;Psylliodes chrysocephala&quot;), rape stem weevil (&quot;Ceutorhynchus napi&quot;) and pollen beetles are the primary insect pests that prey on the oilseed rape crop in Europe. The insect pests can feed on developing pods to lay eggs inside and eat the developing seeds, bore into the plant&#x27;s stem and feed on pollen, leaves and flowers. Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides are the main attack vector against insect pests though there is a large-scale use of prophylactic insecticides in many countries. Molluscicide pellets are used either before or after sowing of the rapeseed crop to protect against slugs.

=== Genetics and breeding ===
In 2014 an SNP array was released for &quot;B. napus&quot; by Dalton-Morgan &quot;et al.&quot;, and another by Clarke &quot;et al.&quot;, in 2016, both of which have since become widely used in molecular breeding. In a demonstration of the importance of epigenetics, Hauben &quot;et al.&quot;, 2009 found that isogenic lines did &quot;not&quot; have identical energy use efficiencies in actual growing conditions, due to epigenetic differences. Specific locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) was applied to &quot;B. napus&quot; by Geng &quot;et al.&quot;, in 2016, revealing the genetics of the past domestication process, providing data for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and being used to construct a high-density linkage map.

==== History of the cultivars ====
In 1973, Canadian agricultural scientists launched a marketing campaign to promote canola consumption. Seed, oil, and protein meal derived from rapeseed cultivars which are low in erucic acid and low in glucosinolates was originally registered as a trademark, in 1978, of the Canola Council of Canada, as &quot;canola&quot;. Canola is now a generic term for edible varieties of rapeseed, but is still officially defined in Canada as rapeseed oil that &quot;must contain less than 2% erucic acid and less than 30 μmol of glucosinolates per gram of air-dried oil-free meal.&quot;
In the 1980s decreasing atmospheric sulphur inputs to Northern European soils in connection with a less efficient internal use of sulphur in the metabolism of the newly bred low-glucosinolate varieties (00-varieties) resulted in an increased appearance of white flowering, a highly specific symptom of sulphur deficiency, in rapeseed crops which during the official variety assessment procedures was wrongly attributed to a genetic inhomogeneity (&quot;Canadian blood&quot;).

The anticipated damages of wild animals caused by foraging on 00-oilseed rape crops was caused by a shift of the animals diet towards increased uptake protein and sulphur containing metabolites at the expense of fibers, but not to specific features of the genetically altered 00-varieties.

Following the European Parliament&#x27;s Transport Biofuels Directive in 2003 promoting the use of biofuels, the cultivation of winter rapeseed increased dramatically in Europe.

Bayer Cropscience, in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen, China, KeyGene, the Netherlands, and the University of Queensland, Australia, announced it had sequenced the entire genome of &quot;B. napus&quot; and its constituent genomes present in &quot;B. rapa&quot; and &quot;B. oleracea&quot; in 2009. The &quot;A&quot; genome component of the amphidiploid rapeseed species &quot;B. napus&quot; has been sequenced by the Multinational &quot;Brassica&quot; Genome Project.

A genetically modified variety of rapeseed was developed in 1998, engineered for glyphosate tolerance, and is considered to be the most disease- and drought-resistant canola. By 2009, 90% of the rapeseed crops planted in Canada were of this sort.

===== GMO cultivars =====
The Monsanto company genetically engineered new cultivars of rapeseed to be resistant to the effects of its herbicide, Roundup. In 1998, they brought this to the Canadian market. Monsanto sought compensation from farmers found to have crops of this cultivar in their fields without paying a license fee. However, these farmers claimed that the pollen containing the &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; gene was blown into their fields and crossed with unaltered canola. Other farmers claimed that after spraying Roundup in non-canola fields to kill weeds before planting, &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; volunteers were left behind, causing extra expense to rid their fields of the weeds.

In a closely followed legal battle, the Supreme Court of Canada found in favor of Monsanto&#x27;s patent infringement claim for unlicensed growing of &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; in its 2004 ruling on &quot;Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser&quot;, but also ruled that Schmeiser was not required to pay any damages. The case garnered international controversy, as a court-sanctioned legitimization for the global patent protection of genetically modified crops. In March 2008, an out-of-court settlement between Monsanto and Schmeiser agreed that Monsanto would clean up the entire GMO-canola crop on Schmeiser&#x27;s farm, at a cost of about CAN$660.

=== Production ===
The Food and Agriculture Organization reports global production of in the 2003–2004 season, and an estimated in the 2010–2011 season.

Worldwide production of rapeseed (including canola) has increased sixfold between 1975 and 2007. The production of canola and rapeseed since 1975 has opened up the edible oil market for rapeseed oil. Since 2002, production of biodiesel has been steadily increasing in EU and U.S. to in 2006. Rapeseed oil is positioned to supply a good portion of the vegetable oils needed to produce that fuel. World production was thus expected to trend further upward between 2005 and 2015 as biodiesel content requirements in Europe go into effect.

== Uses ==
Rapeseed is grown for the production of edible vegetable oils, animal feed, and biodiesel. Rapeseed was the third-leading source of vegetable oil in the world in 2000, after soybean and palm oil. It is the world&#x27;s second-leading source of protein meal after soybean.

=== Vegetable oil ===
Rapeseed oil is one of the oldest known vegetable oils, but historically was used in limited quantities due to high levels of erucic acid, which is damaging to cardiac muscle of animals, and glucosinolates, which made it less nutritious in animal feed. Rapeseed oil can contain up to 54% erucic acid. Food-grade oil derived from rapeseed cultivars, known as canola oil or low-erucic-acid rapeseed oil (LEAR oil), has been generally recognized as safe by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Canola oil is limited by government regulation to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the US and 2% in the EU, with special regulations for infant food. These low levels of erucic acid are not believed to cause harm in human infants.

=== Animal feed ===
Processing of rapeseed for oil production produces rapeseed meal as a byproduct. The byproduct is a high-protein animal feed, competitive with soybean. Rapeseed is an excellent silage crop (fermented and stored in air-tight conditions for later use as a winterfeed). The feed is employed mostly for cattle feeding, but is also used for pigs and poultry. However, the high levels of glucosinolates, sinapine, and phytic acid in the seed cake of rapeseed cause detrimental health effects to animals, reduce digestibility of certain nutrients, reduce palatability, and contribute to eutrophication of waterways. In China, rapeseed meal is mostly used as a soil fertilizer rather than for animal feed.

=== Biodiesel ===
Rapeseed oil is used as diesel fuel, either as biodiesel, straight in heated fuel systems, or blended with petroleum distillates for powering motor vehicles. Biodiesel may be used in pure form in newer engines without engine damage and is frequently combined with fossil-fuel diesel in ratios varying from 2% to 20% biodiesel. Owing to the costs of growing, crushing, and refining rapeseed biodiesel, rapeseed-derived biodiesel from new oil costs more to produce than standard diesel fuel, so diesel fuels are commonly made from the used oil. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil stock for biodiesel production in most of Europe, accounting for about 80% of the feedstock, partly because rapeseed produces more oil per unit of land area compared to other oil sources, such as soybeans, but primarily because canola oil has a significantly lower gel point than most other vegetable oils.

Because of anticipated changes to climate, a 2018 study predicted that rapeseed would become an unreliable source of oil for biofuels.

=== Other ===
Rapeseed is also used as a cover crop in the US during the winter as it prevents soil erosion, produces large amounts of biomass, suppresses weeds and can improve soil tilth with its root system. Some cultivars of rapeseed are also used as annual forage and are ready for grazing livestock 80 to 90 days after planting.

Rapeseed has a high melliferous potential (produces substances that can be collected by insects) and is a main forage crop for honeybees. Monofloral rapeseed honey has a whitish or milky yellow color, peppery taste and, due to its fast crystallization time, a soft-solid texture. It crystallizes within 3 to 4 weeks and can ferment over time if stored improperly. The low fructose-to-glucose ratio in monofloral rapeseed honey causes it to quickly granulate in the honeycomb, forcing beekeepers to extract the honey within 24 hours of it being capped.

As a biolubricant, rapeseed has possible uses for bio-medical applications (e.g., lubricants for artificial joints) and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes. Biolubricant containing 70% or more canola/rapeseed oil has replaced petroleum-based chainsaw oil in Austria although it is typically more expensive.

Rapeseed has been researched as a means of containing radionuclides that contaminated the soil after the Chernobyl disaster as it has a rate of uptake up to three times more than other grains, and only about 3 to 6% of the radionuclides go into the oilseeds.

Rapeseed meal can be incorporated into the soil as a biofumigant. It suppresses such fungal crop pathogens as &quot;Rhizoctonia solani&quot; and &quot;Pratylenchus penetr&quot;.

<text>Annulment is a legal procedure within secular and religious legal systems for declaring a marriage null and void. Unlike divorce, it is usually retroactive, meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place. In legal terminology, an annulment makes a void marriage or a voidable marriage null.

==Void vs voidable marriage==

A difference exists between a &quot;void marriage&quot; and a &quot;voidable marriage&quot;.

A void marriage is a marriage that was not legally valid under the laws of the jurisdiction where the marriage occurred, and is void &quot;ab initio&quot;. Although the marriage is void as a matter of law, in some jurisdictions an annulment is required to establish that the marriage is void or may be sought in order to obtain formal documentation that the marriage was voided. Under the laws of most nations, children born during a void marriage are considered legitimate. Depending upon the jurisdiction, reasons for why a marriage may be legally void may include consanguinity (incestual marriage), bigamy, group marriage, or child marriage.

A voidable marriage is a marriage that can be canceled at the option of one of the parties. The marriage is valid, but may be annulled if contested in court by one of the parties to the marriage. The petition to void the marriage must be brought by one of the parties to the marriage, and a voidable marriage thus cannot be annulled after the death of one of the parties. A marriage may be voidable for a variety of reasons, depending on jurisdiction. Common reasons for allowing a party to void a marriage include entry into the marriage as a result of threat or coercion. Some jurisdictions have a distinction between legal age of majority and legal age of marriage; in this case, it is usually the custom that the marriage can proceed with parental or guardian consent, and the marital parties being able to ratify or void the marriage upon reaching the age of majority. These are also considered voidable marriages.

The principal difference between a void and voidable marriage is that, as a void marriage is invalid from the beginning, no legal action is required to set the marriage aside. A marriage may be challenged as void by a third party, for example in probate proceedings during which a party to the void marriage is claiming inheritance rights as a spouse. In contrast, a voidable marriage may be ended only through the judgment of a court, and may be voided only upon the petition of one of the parties to the marriage or, if a party is under a legal disability, by a third party representative such as a parent or legal guardian.

The legal distinction between void and voidable marriages can be significant in relation to forced marriage. In a jurisdiction that classifies forced marriages as void, then the state can cancel the marriage even against the will of the spouses. In contrast, if the law provides that a forced marriage is voidable then, even if it can be proved that the marriage was forced, the state cannot act to end the marriage in the absence of an application by a spouse.

==Christianity==
===Catholicism===


In the canon law of the Catholic Church, an annulment is properly called a &quot;Declaration of Nullity&quot;, because according to Catholic doctrine, the marriage of baptized persons is a sacrament and, once consummated and thereby confirmed, cannot be dissolved as long as the parties to it are alive. A &quot;Declaration of Nullity&quot; is not dissolution of a marriage, but merely the legal finding that a valid marriage was never contracted. This is analogous to a finding that a contract of sale is invalid, and hence, that the property for sale must be considered to have never been legally transferred into another&#x27;s ownership. A divorce, on the other hand, is viewed as returning the property after a consummated sale.

The Pope may dispense from a marriage &quot;ratum sed non consummatum&quot; since, having been ratified (&quot;ratum&quot;) but not consummated (&quot;sed non-consummatum&quot;), it is not absolutely unbreakable. A valid natural marriage is not regarded as a sacrament if at least one of the parties is not baptized. In certain circumstances it can be dissolved in cases of Pauline privilege and Petrine privilege, but only for the sake of the higher good of the spiritual welfare of one of the parties.

Although an annulment is thus a declaration that &quot;the marriage never existed&quot;, the Church recognizes that the relationship was a putative marriage, which gives rise to &quot;natural obligations&quot;. In canon law, children conceived or born of either a valid or a putative marriage are considered legitimate, and illegitimate children are legitimized by a putative marriage of their parents, as by a valid marriage.
Certain conditions are necessary for the marriage contract to be valid in canon law. Lack of any of these conditions makes a marriage invalid and constitutes legal grounds for a declaration of nullity. Accordingly, apart from the question of diriment impediments dealt with below, there is a fourfold classification of contractual defects: defect of form, defect of contract, defect of willingness, defect of capacity. For annulment, proof is required of the existence of one of these defects, since canon law presumes all marriages are valid until proven otherwise.

Canon law stipulates canonical impediments to marriage. A diriment impediment prevents a marriage from being validly contracted at all and renders the union a putative marriage, while a &quot;prohibitory&quot; impediment renders a marriage valid but not licit. The union resulting is called a putative marriage. An invalid marriage may be subsequently convalidated, either by simple convalidation (renewal of consent that replaces invalid consent) or by &quot;sanatio in radice&quot; (&quot;healing in the root&quot;, the retroactive dispensation from a diriment impediment). Some impediments may be dispensed from, while those &quot;de jure divino&quot; (of divine law) may not be dispensed.

In some countries, such as Italy, in which Catholic Church marriages are automatically transcribed to the civil records, a Church declaration of nullity may be granted the exequatur and treated as the equivalent of a civil divorce.

===Independent Catholicism===
Annulments are granted by certain Independent Catholic denominations, such as the Evangelical Catholic Church.

===Anglicanism===
The Church of England, the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion, historically had the right to grant annulments, while divorces were &quot;only available through an Act of Parliament.&quot; Examples in which annulments were granted by the Anglican Church included being under age, having committed fraud, using force, and lunacy.

Certain Continuing Anglican denominations, such as the Anglican Catholic Church, offer annulments, which are granted by the bishop.

===Methodism===
&quot;Methodist Theology Today&quot;, edited by Clive Marsh, states that:

==Islam==
&quot;Faskh&quot; means &quot;to annul&quot; in Islam. It is a Sharia-granted procedure to judicially rescind a marriage.

A man does not need grounds to divorce his wife in Islam. To divorce, he can simply invoke &quot;Talaq&quot; and part with the dower he gave her before marriage; alternatively, he can invoke the &quot;Lian&quot; doctrine in case of adultery, either by bringing four witnesses who saw the wife committing adultery or by self-testifying and swearing by Allah four times. Sharia law then requires the court to grant the divorce requested by the man. &quot;Talaq&quot; is controversial, though it is a widely held belief, the Qu&#x27;ran insists counseling between two parties is necessary first before considering divorce when there is dissention/contention between spouses (Qu&#x27;ran ). The marriage contract clauses agreed upon must be honored when divorce is invoked.

Also, Sharia does grant a Muslim woman simple ways to end her marital relationship and without declaring the reason. &quot;Faskh&quot; or (kholo) (annulment) doctrine specifies certain situations when a Sharia court can grant her request and annul the marriage.

Grounds for Faskh are: (a) irregular marriage (&quot;fasid&quot;), (b) forbidden marriage (&quot;batil&quot;), (c) the marriage was contracted by non-Muslim husband who adopted Islam &quot;after&quot; marriage, (d) the husband or wife became an apostate after marriage, (e) husband is unable to consummate the marriage. In each of these cases, the wife must provide four independent witnesses acceptable to the &quot;Qadi&quot; (religious judge), who has the discretion to declare the evidence unacceptable.

In Sunni Maliki school of jurisprudence (fiqh), cruelty, disease, life-threatening ailment and desertion are additional Sharia approved grounds for the wife or the husband to seek annulment of the marriage. In these cases too, the wife must provide two male witnesses or one male and two female witnesses or in some cases four witnesses, acceptable to the &quot;Qadi&quot; (religious judge), who has the discretion to declare the evidence unacceptable.

In certain circumstances, an unrelated Muslim can petition a &quot;Qadi&quot; to void (faskh) the marriage of a Muslim couple who may not want the marriage to end. For example, in case the third party detects apostasy from Islam by either husband or wife (through blasphemy, failure to respect Sharia, or conversion of husband or wife or both from Islam to Christianity, etc.). In cases of apostasy, in addition to annulment of the marriage, the apostate may face additional penalties such as death sentence, imprisonment and civil penalties unless they repent and return to Islam.

==Civil law==
===Australia===
Since 1975, Australian law provides only for void marriages. Before 1975, there were both void and voidable marriages. Today, under the &quot;Family Law Act 1975&quot; (Cth.) a decree of nullity can only be made if a marriage is void.

A marriage is void if:
* one or both of the parties were already married at the time (i.e. bigamy)
* the parties are in a prohibited relationship (i.e. closely related such as siblings)
* the parties did not comply with the marriage laws in the jurisdiction where they were married (note that although a marriage contracted abroad is in general considered valid in Australia, in certain cases, such as when there are serious contradictions with the marriage laws of Australia, the marriage is void)
* one or both of the parties were under-age and did not have the necessary approvals, (minimum marriageable age is 16, but 16- and 17-years-olds need special court approval) or
* one or both of the parties were forced into the marriage.

===England and Wales===

England and Wales provides for both void and voidable marriages.

;Void marriage
*Spouses are closely related
*One of the spouses was under the minimum age for marriage at the time (16 before 27 February 2023 and 18 from then)
*One of the spouses was already married or in a civil partnership
;Voidable marriage
*Non-consummation
*No proper consent to entering the marriage (forced marriage)
*The other spouse had a sexually transmitted disease at the time of marriage
*The woman was pregnant by another man at the time of marriage
*One of the spouses is in the process of changing their legal gender

Section 13 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 provides for certain restrictions in regard to the possibility of annulling voidable marriages, including where the petitioner knew of the &quot;defect&quot; and of the possibility of annulment, but induced the respondent to believe that the petitioner would not seek an annulment; or where it would be &quot;unjust&quot; to the respondent to grant the decree of nullity. There is usually a time limit of three years from the date of the marriage in order to institute the proceedings.

===France===
In France, a country of Roman Catholic tradition, annulment features prominently in law, and can be obtained for many reasons. The law provides for both void and voidable marriages. (see articles 180 to 202, and articles 144, 145, 146, 146–1, 147, 148, 161, 162, 163, and 164 of the French Civil Code)
* void marriage: forced marriage (not to be confused with consent obtained under deception which makes a marriage voidable not void); underage marriage; bigamy; incestuous marriage; lack of legal competence of the registrar; and clandestine marriage (i.e. hiding the marriage from the public, no witnesses present)
* voidable marriage: vices of consent, i.e. consent obtained under deception/by misrepresentation of one&#x27;s personal characteristics, personal past, intentions after marriage, etc., where the deceived spouse discovers after the marriage the deceit (given a very broad interpretation by the courts); and failure to secure the authorization of the person who should have authorized the marriage (i.e. lack of authorization of guardians of a mentally challenged spouse)

===Philippines===

Divorce is mostly not available as a legal method to dissolve marriage in the Philippines. To most of the Filipino population, annulment is the only legal recourse to dissolve marital unions. Muslims who married under Islamic rites can divorce.

The annulment process and prerequisite under Philippine civil law are defined under the Family Code of the Philippines. Under Philippine civil law, &quot;annulment&quot; and &quot;declaration of nullity&quot; are legally distinct.

Annulments are considered valid until the point of termination, hence children conceived or born before termination are considered legitimate.

This contrasts to a declaration of nullity, where a marital union is rendered a void marriage or never valid from the beginning.

Annulments granted by religious institutions including the Roman Catholic church, the majority Christian denomination in the Philippines, does not legally void marriages. Married couples still have to seek civil annulment.

===United States===
In the United States, the laws governing annulment are different in each state. Although the grounds for seeking an annulment differ, as can factors that may disqualify a person for an annulment, common grounds for annulment include the following:
* Marriage between close relatives. States typically prohibit marriages between a parent and child, grandparent and grandchild, or between siblings, and many restrict marriages between first cousins.
* Mental incapacity. A person who is not legally capable of consenting to marriage based upon mental illness or incapacity, including incapacity caused by intoxication, may later seek an annulment.
* Underage marriage. If one or both spouses are below the legal age to marry, then the marriage is subject to being annulled.
* Duress. A person who enters a marriage due to threats or force may later seek an annulment.
* Fraud. A spouse is tricked into marrying the other spouse, through the misrepresentation or concealment of important facts about the other spouse, such as a criminal record, pregnancy by another man, or infection with a sexually transmitted disease.
* Bigamy. One spouse was already married at the time of the marriage for which annulment is sought.
For some grounds of annulment, such as concealment of infertility, if after discovering the potential basis for an annulment a couple continues to live together as a married couple, that reason may be deemed forgiven. For underage marriages, annulment must typically be sought while the underage spouse remains a minor, or shortly after that spouse reaches the age of majority, or the issue is deemed waived.

====Arizona====
In Arizona, a &quot;voidable&quot; marriage is one in which there is &quot;an undissolved prior marriage, one party being underage, a blood relationship, the absence of mental or physical capacity, intoxication, the absence of a valid license, duress, refusal of intercourse, fraud, and misrepresentation as to religion.&quot;

====Illinois====

In Illinois, an annulment is a judicial determination that a valid marriage never existed. One of the parties must file with the court a petition for invalidity of marriage. There are four grounds for annulment in Illinois:
*Inability to consent to marriage, for example as a result of mental disability, intoxication, force, duress or fraud;
*One spouse cannot have sexual intercourse, with that fact being unknown to the other spouse at the time of marriage;
*One spouse was under the age of 18, and married without the consent of a parent, legal guardian, or court; and
* The marriage was illegal, such as in the case of bigamy or certain close blood relationships.

====Nevada====
In Nevada, annulment is available when: a marriage that was void at the time performed (such as blood relatives, bigamy), lacked consent (such as, underage, intoxication, insanity), or is based on some kind of dishonesty.

A couple who was married in Nevada will qualify to file for annulment in that state, no matter where they live at the time of filing. Those who were married outside Nevada must establish residency by living there for a minimum of six weeks before filing.

====New York====

New York law provides for: &quot;Incestuous and void marriages&quot; (DRL §5); &quot;Void marriages&quot; (DRL §6)
&quot;Voidable marriages&quot; (DRL §7).

The cause of action for annulment of a voidable marriage in New York State is generally fraud (DRL §140 (e)). There are other arguments. Fraud generally means the intentional deception of the Plaintiff by the Defendant in order to induce the Plaintiff to marry. The misrepresentation must be substantial in nature, and the Plaintiff&#x27;s consent to the marriage predicated on the Defendant&#x27;s statement. The perpetration of the fraud (prior to the marriage), and the discovery of the fraud (subsequent to the marriage) must be proven by corroboration of a witness or other external proof, even if the Defendant admits guilt (DRL §144). The time limit is three years (not one year). This does not run from the date of the marriage, but the date the fraud was discovered, or could reasonably have been discovered.

Annulments may also be granted to a spouse under the age of 18, where marriage occurred without lawful parental consent or court approval, where a party lacked the mental capacity to consent to marriage, where one of the parties lacked the physical capacity to consummate the marriage and the other was not aware of that disability at the time of marriage, or for incurable mental illness for a period of five years or more.

A bigamous marriage (one where one party was still married at the time of the second marriage) as well as an incestuous marriage is &quot;void ab initio&quot; (not legal from its inception). However, there is still the need for an &quot;Action to Declare the Nullity of a Void Marriage&quot; (DRL §140 (a)), upon which the Court, after proper pleadings, renders a judgment that the marriage is void. There may be effects of marriage such as a property settlement and even maintenance if the court finds it equitable to order such relief.

====Wisconsin====

In Wisconsin, the possible requirements for annulment include: bigamy, incest, or inducing the bride to be married under duress (see Shotgun marriage). Marriages may also be nullified due to one or more of the parties being: underage, intoxicated, or being mentally unsound.

Marriages may also be nullified due to fraud from one or more of three categories: defendant, marriage witness(es), or marriage officiant. Any misrepresentation by those three parties, including but not limited to lying about: status as officiant, ability to perform the ceremony, age of the participants or witnesses, felony status or current marriage status of either member of the married couple can be grounds for an annulment on the basis of fraud. Fraud in this cases is prosecuted under Wisconsin Law 943.39 as a Class H felony.

==Multiple annulments for Henry VIII==
Henry VIII of England had three of his six marriages annulled. These marriages were to Catherine of Aragon (on the grounds that she had already been married to his brother—although this annulment is not recognized by the Catholic Church); Anne Boleyn (not wishing to execute his legal wife, he offered her an easy death if she would agree to an annulment); and Anne of Cleves (on the grounds of non-consummation of the marriage and the fact that she had previously been engaged to someone else). Catherine Howard never had her marriage annulled. She had committed adultery with Thomas Culpeper during the marriage, and she had flirted with members of his court. Because of this, on November 22, 1541, it was proclaimed at Hampton Court that she had &quot;forfeited the honour and title of Queen,&quot; and was from then on to be known only as the Lady Catherine Howard. Under this title she was executed for high treason three months later.

==Controversies==
The grounds of annulment in regard to a voidable marriage, and indeed the concept of a voidable marriage itself, have become controversial in recent years. According to a paper in &quot;Singapore Academy of Law Journal&quot;:

:&quot;Where divorce is available to all, it seems somewhat inconsistent to favour some groups of unhappily married people by giving them the privilege of choosing whether to put an end to their misery by way of annulment or by way of divorce. It is also worthy of note that some judges, like Coomaraswamy J. in Chua Ai Hwa (mw), have noted that some of the grounds making a marriage voidable have tended to be abused by parties who hope the court will grant the petition on fairly skimpy evidence simply because the petition is not defended.&quot;

<text>At the 1904 Summer Olympics of St. Louis, Missouri, eleven gymnastics events were contested for the first time.

The 1904 Games had a program of events spread out over several months, and the gymnastics competition was no different. The International Olympic Committee considers two sets of events as &quot;Olympic&quot;:
*&quot;International Turners&#x27; Championship&quot; held July 1–2, comprising the all-around, triathlon, and team events
*&quot;Olympic Gymnastics Championships&quot; held October 29, comprising the seven individual apparatus events and the combined event.

The individual all-around was a combination of the gymnastic triathlon competition and the athletics triathlon. The team competition was a combination of individual scores from the individual all-around.
The parallel bars, horizontal bar, vault, and pommel horse scores for each gymnast were summed to get the combined score.

<text>A network segment is a portion of a computer network. The nature and extent of a segment depends on the nature of the network and the device or devices used to interconnect end stations.

==Ethernet==
According to the defining IEEE 802.3 standards for Ethernet, a network segment is an &quot;electrical connection&quot; between networked devices using a shared medium. In the original 10BASE5 and 10BASE2 Ethernet varieties, a segment would therefore correspond to a single coax cable and all devices tapped into it. At this point in the evolution of Ethernet, multiple network segments could be connected with repeaters (in accordance with the 5-4-3 rule for 10 Mbit Ethernet) to form a larger collision domain.

With twisted-pair Ethernet, electrical segments can be joined together using repeaters or repeater hubs as can other varieties of Ethernet. This corresponds to the extent of an OSI layer 1 network and is equivalent to the collision domain. The 5-4-3 rule applies to this collision domain. 

Using switches or bridges, multiple layer-1 segments can be combined to a common layer-2 segment, i.e. all nodes can communicate with each other through MAC addressing or broadcasts. A layer-2 segment is equivalent to a broadcast domain. Traffic within a layer-2 segment can be separated into virtually distinct partitions by using VLANs. Each VLAN forms its own logical layer-2 segment.

==IP==
A layer-3 segment in an IP network is called a subnetwork, formed by all nodes sharing the same network prefix as defined by their IP addresses and the network mask. Communication between layer-3 subnets requires a router. Hosts on a subnet communicate directly using the layer-2 segment that connects them. Most often a subnetwork corresponds exactly with the underlying layer-2 segment but it is also possible to run multiple subnets on a single layer-2 segment.

<text>The sport of field lacrosse was played at the 1904 Summer Olympics, which marked the first time that lacrosse had been featured at the Olympic Games. Three teams participated — two from Canada and one from the United States. One of the Canadian teams consisted entirely of Mohawk nation players. The victorious Shamrock Lacrosse Team is more commonly known as the Winnipeg Shamrocks.

A second American team, the Brooklyn Crescents, was entered but did not participate: they were scheduled to play a semi-final against the Shamrocks, but arrived too late and were disqualified.

<text>In mineralogy, crystal habit is the characteristic external shape of an individual crystal or aggregate of crystals. The habit of a crystal is dependent on its crystallographic form and growth conditions, which generally creates irregularities due to limited space in the crystallizing medium (commonly in rocks).

==Crystal forms==
Recognizing the habit can aid in mineral identification and description, as the crystal habit is an external representation of the internal ordered atomic arrangement. Most natural crystals, however, do not display ideal habits and are commonly malformed. Hence, it is also important to describe the quality of the shape of a mineral specimen:

* Euhedral: a crystal that is completely bounded by its characteristic faces, well-formed. Synonymous terms: idiomorphic, automorphic;
* Subhedral: a crystal partially bounded by its characteristic faces and partially by irregular surfaces. Synonymous terms: hypidiomorphic, hypautomorphic;
* Anhedral: a crystal that lacks any of its characteristic faces, completely malformed. Synonymous terms: allotriomorphic, xenomorphic.

==Altering factors==

Factors influencing habit include: a combination of two or more crystal forms; trace impurities present during growth; crystal twinning and growth conditions (i.e., heat, pressure, space); and specific growth tendencies such as growth striations. Minerals belonging to the same crystal system do not necessarily exhibit the same habit. Some habits of a mineral are unique to its variety and locality: For example, while most sapphires form elongate barrel-shaped crystals, those found in Montana form stout &quot;tabular&quot; crystals. Ordinarily, the latter habit is seen only in ruby. Sapphire and ruby are both varieties of the same mineral: corundum.

Some minerals may replace other existing minerals while preserving the original&#x27;s habit, i.e. pseudomorphous replacement. A classic example is tiger&#x27;s eye quartz, crocidolite asbestos replaced by silica. While quartz typically forms &quot;prismatic&quot; (elongate, prism-like) crystals, in tiger&#x27;s eye the original &quot;fibrous&quot; habit of crocidolite is preserved.

<doc id="219570" wikidata="Q451331" url="?curid=219570" title="Jacques Tits">
<text>Jacques Tits () (12 August 1930 – 5 December 2021) was a Belgian-born French mathematician who worked on group theory and incidence geometry. He introduced Tits buildings, the Tits alternative, the Tits group, and the Tits metric.

== Early life and education ==
Tits was born in Uccle, Belgium to Léon Tits, a professor, and Lousia André. Jacques attended the Athénée of Uccle and the Free University of Brussels. His thesis advisor was , and Tits graduated with his doctorate in 1950 with the dissertation &quot;Généralisation des groupes projectifs basés sur la notion de transitivité&quot;.

==Career==
Tits held professorships at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel) (1962–1964), the University of Bonn (1964–1974) and the Collège de France in Paris, until becoming emeritus in 2000. He changed his citizenship to French in 1974 in order to teach at the Collège de France, which at that point required French citizenship. Because Belgian nationality law did not allow dual nationality at the time, he renounced his Belgian citizenship.

Tits was an &quot;honorary&quot; member of the Nicolas Bourbaki group; as such, he helped popularize H.S.M. Coxeter&#x27;s work, introducing terms such as Coxeter number, Coxeter group, and Coxeter graph.

== Death ==
Tits died on 5 December 2021, at the age of 91 in the 13th arrondissement, Paris.

== Awards and honors ==
Tits received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1993, the Cantor Medal from the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung (German Mathematical Society) in 1996, and the German distinction &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;. In 2008 he was awarded the Abel Prize, along with John Griggs Thompson, &quot;for their profound achievements in algebra and in particular for shaping modern group theory&quot;.

Tits became a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1979. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988.

== Contributions ==
He introduced the theory of &quot;buildings&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;Tits buildings&quot;), which are combinatorial structures on which groups act, particularly in algebraic group theory (including finite groups, and groups defined over the p-adic numbers). The related theory of (B, N) pairs is a basic tool in the theory of groups of Lie type. Of particular importance is his classification of all irreducible buildings of spherical type and rank at least three, which involved classifying all polar spaces of rank at least three. The existence of these buildings initially depended on the existence of a group of Lie type in each case, but in joint work with Mark Ronan he constructed those of rank at least four independently, yielding the groups directly. In the rank-2 case spherical building are generalized n-gons, and in joint work with Richard Weiss he classified these when they admit a suitable group of symmetries (the so-called Moufang polygons). In collaboration with François Bruhat he developed the theory of affine buildings, and later he classified all irreducible buildings of affine type and rank at least four.

Another of his well-known theorems is the &quot;Tits alternative&quot;: if &quot;G&quot; is a finitely generated subgroup of a linear group, then either &quot;G&quot; has a solvable subgroup of finite index or it has a free subgroup of rank 2.

The Tits group and the Kantor–Koecher–Tits construction are named after him. He introduced the Kneser–Tits conjecture.

<doc id="219575" wikidata="Q490149" url="?curid=219575" title="Remorse">
<text>Remorse is a distressing emotion experienced by an individual who regrets actions which they have done in the past that they deem to be shameful, hurtful, or wrong. Remorse is closely allied to guilt and self-directed resentment. When a person regrets an earlier action or failure to act, it may be because of remorse or in response to various other consequences, including being punished for the act or omission. People may express remorse through apologies, trying to repair the damage they&#x27;ve caused, or self-imposed punishments.

In a legal context, the perceived remorse of an offender is assessed by Western justice systems during trials, sentencing, parole hearings, and in restorative justice. However, there are epistemological problems with assessing an offender&#x27;s level of remorse.

A person who is incapable of feeling remorse is often diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, as characterized in the DSM IV-TR. In general, a person needs to be unable to feel fear, as well as remorse, in order to develop psychopathic traits. Legal and business professions such as insurance have done research on the expression of remorse via apologies, primarily because of the potential litigation and financial implications.

==Studies on apologizing==
Studies on apologizing include &quot;The Five Languages of Apology&quot; by Gary Chapman and Jennifer Thomas and &quot;On Apology&quot; by Aaron Lazare. These studies indicate that effective apologies that express remorse typically include:

* a detailed account of the offense
* acknowledgment of the hurt or damage done
* acceptance of the responsibility for, and ownership of, the act or omission
* an explanation that recognises one&#x27;s role

As well, apologies usually include a statement or expression of regret, humility, or remorse; a request for forgiveness; and an expression of a credible commitment to change or a promise that it will not happen again. Apologies may also include some form of restitution, compensation or token gesture in line with the damage that one has caused. John Kleefeld has encapsulated this into &quot;four Rs&quot; that typically make for a fully effective apology: remorse, responsibility, resolution and reparation. When an apology is delayed, for instance if a friend has been wronged and the offending party does not apologise, the perception of the offense can compound over time. This is sometimes known as compounding remorse.

==Compunction==
&quot;Compunction&quot;, in modern times generally denoting a relatively slight pricking of conscience,
formerly expressed connotations of actively expressing remorse,
usually requiring remorseful individuals to physically approach the person to whom they wish to express regret. Medieval-style compunction could serve as an incentive to partake in the sacrament of confession or penance.

==Falsified expressions==
In a study led by Leanne ten Brinke, a professor at the University of British Columbia, participants&#x27; genuine and falsified emotions were studied to investigate behavioral and facial cues. Brinke and others found a significant difference in the presence of facial expressions in real and false remorse. With falsified emotions of remorse, they found that the participants experienced a greater range of emotions, which are close to genuine feelings, while deceptive descriptions of remorse were associated with positive emotions, such as happiness and surprise. The positive emotions felt by participants demonstrating a deceptive description of remorse are likely due to the leakage of genuine feelings from incomplete deception. Brinke and others established that participants appeared surprised because they could only raise their eyebrows when trying to appear sad, which then caused the participants to feel embarrassed, feel genuine happiness, and let a smile slip. In contrast to deceptive and falsified accounts, genuine accounts were expressed with fewer emotions. Participants showing deceptive or falsified emotions overcompensated their emotional performance. Genuine negative feelings of remorse leaked by the lower face were immediately covered up with a neutral expression. Brinke recorded a small number of body language and verbal cues for deceptive participants; instead, she recorded a large number of speech hesitations that cued deceptive and falsified accounts of remorse. Current findings of deceptive and falsified remorse have a practical use for measuring the veracity of remorseful displays for judges, jurors, parole officers, and psychologists when sentencing offenders.

==Psychopathy==

Psychopathic individuals are best known for their flagrant disregard for social and moral norms. Psychopaths have dysfunctional personal relationships, characterized by violence, exploitation, and philandering. Emotionally, they are incapable of feeling guilt or empathy, they respond abnormally to fear and pain, and other emotions are shallow compared to population norms. Psychopaths refuse to adopt social and moral norms because they are not swayed by the emotions, such as guilt, remorse, or fear of retribution, that influence other human beings.

Human societies tend to value remorse; conversely, a person who exhibits a lack of remorse is often perceived in a negative light. It is widely accepted that remorse is the proper reaction to misconduct. Remorse may originate in from either actual or contrived regret for the misconduct that results in being caught or causing harm. Research has shown that the facial expressions of offenders on trial affect the jury&#x27;s attitude and, in turn, the sentencing decision. While remorse may present guilt that may influence a jury&#x27;s decision, a lack of remorse influences the jury even more because it is one trait of psychopathy.

Psychopathy represents a configuration of traits that are missing within a person&#x27;s personality, such as a lack of empathy and remorse. Knowledge of psychopathic traits has been shown to affect how jurors perceive adult and juvenile offenders. Assessments of psychopathy are introduced to direct a relatively wide variety of questions in the legal system, so investigators have started examining the effects of psychopathy evidences. Through simulations in studies by John Edens, who is a psychology professor at Texas A&amp;M University, data suggests that attributing psychopathic traits to adult and juvenile offenders can have a noticeable negative effect on how these individuals are viewed by others. Remorselessness, a key feature of psychopathy, proves to be a strong predictor of juror attitudes. In the study by John Edens, a pool of offenders were labeled as either having a &quot;disorder&quot; condition or having &quot;no disorder&quot;. Those labeled as &quot;disorder&quot; were given death verdicts by mock jurors. In the study, traits, such as callousness, remorselessness, and superficial charm, were a strong predictor of negative consequences for the offenders. This study found that remorselessness has the largest effect on the mock jurors&#x27; opinions of the &quot;disorder&quot; offenders and it explains support for the death sentence. The results of this study suggest that free of mental health testimonies, perceptions of a defendant&#x27;s personality traits may have serious implications in the sentencing decisions of a capital case.

One study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths&#x27; empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests psychopaths can switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say they do not know how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it might be possible to rehabilitate psychopaths by helping them to activate their &quot;empathy switch&quot;. Others suggested that it remains unclear whether psychopaths&#x27; experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.

One problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and punishment as psychopathy, as these entail suspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences. Psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry&#x27;s standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.

Work conducted by Professor Jean Decety with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray parts of the brain, but more activity in the striatum and the insula when compared to control participants. In a second study, individuals with psychopathy exhibited a strong response in pain-affective brain regions when taking an imagine-self perspective, but failed to recruit the neural circuits that were activated in controls during an imagine-other perspective—in particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala—which may contribute to their lack of empathic concern.

Researchers have investigated whether people who have high levels of psychopathy have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but lack the ability to use affective empathy. People who score highly on psychopathy measures are less likely to exhibit affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation, showing that psychopathy and lack of affective empathy correspond strongly. found those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions. Therefore, such individuals do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion and concern towards the wellbeing of others.

In fact, in an experiment published in March 2007 at the University of Southern California neuroscientist Antonio R. Damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that when confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with &quot;end-justifies-the-means&quot; answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to Adrian Raine, a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study&#x27;s implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: &quot;Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?&quot;

Psychopathic individuals do not show regret or remorse. This was thought to be due to an inability to generate this emotion in response to negative outcomes. However, in 2016, people with antisocial personality disorder (also known as dissocial personality disorder) were found to experience regret, but did not use the regret to guide their choice in behavior. There was no lack of regret but a problem to think through a range of potential actions and estimating the outcome values.

==Forgiveness==
The perception of remorse is essential to an apology, and the greater the perception of remorse the more effective the apology. An effective apology reduces negative consequences and facilitates cognitive and behavioral changes associated with forgiveness. With empathy as the mediator between apologies and forgiveness and remorse as the essential part to an apology, one can expect empathy to mediate perceived remorse forgiveness. Remorse may signal that one is suffering psychologically because of one&#x27;s negative behavior, which leads to empathy from the victim, who may then express forgiveness. In a study by James Davis and Greg Gold, 170 university students filled out questionnaires about forgiveness within interpersonal relationships. Davis and Gold&#x27;s findings suggest that when a victim perceives an apology to be remorseful, then they believe the negative behavior will not occur again, and they will be more willing to forgive the perpetrator.

==Versus self-condemnation==
Remorse is closely linked with the willingness to humble oneself and to repent for one&#x27;s misdeeds. Remorse is not as such when defined through the view of self-condemnation. Self-condemnation, more so than remorse, is said to be associated with poor psychological well-being. Remorse captures feelings of guilt, regret, and sorrow. Forgiveness does not eliminate all negative feelings, but it may entail the reduction of bitter and angry feelings, not feelings of disappointment, regret, or sorrow. A study by Mickie Fisher found that people who forgive themselves for serious offenses may continue to harbor remorse or regret. In contrast to remorse, self-condemnation reflects a more global, negative, severe stance toward oneself. Remorse may convey a sense of sorrow, while self-condemnation suggests the kind of loathing and desire for punishment that characterizes interpersonal grudges. Fisher suggests that self-forgiveness does not necessarily require one to get rid of feelings or regret or remorse. Based on the study by Fisher, self-forgiveness seems to relate more closely to self-condemnation and not remorse. When trying to convince people to forgive themselves, it is crucial not to erase the potentially adaptive feelings of remorse along with the more destructive self-condemnation. People can grow and experience prosocial behaviors once they accept responsibility for their own transgressions. For genuine self-forgiveness, one must first accept responsibility for their offenses and not rush to rid themselves of guilty feelings.

==Buyer&#x27;s remorse==

Purchases can be divided into two different categories: material or experiential. A material good is made to be kept in the buyer&#x27;s possession, while an experiential good provides the buyer with life experience. A material good provides the buyer with a more enduring pleasure compared with an experiential, as these two purchases also result in different types of regret. While experiential purchases bring about regrets of a missed opportunity, material purchases result in buyer&#x27;s remorse, which means that a person dwells on how their material purchase measure up to other purchases they could have made and how it compares with other people&#x27;s purchases. These comparisons diminish satisfaction from the original purpose. Past research explains that regrets of action are intense, but only in the short term, while regrets of inaction gains intensity over time and dominates people&#x27;s experience. Major life choices, such as marriage, jobs, and education, are often the focus of regret. Everyday experience suggests that everyday decisions are the most frequent causes of regret. Marketing directors know the effects of buyer&#x27;s remorse, and use it to their advantage when planning marketing strategies. The regret felt over choosing a material over an experiential purchase depends on the pain of the factors underlying the purchase. Based on research by Thomas Gilovich and Emily Rosenzwig, material purchases are more likely to lead to regret, while experiential purchases give the buyer more satisfaction even over time.

<text>Freedom of association encompasses both an individual&#x27;s right to join or leave groups voluntarily, the right of the group to take collective action to pursue the interests of its members, and the right of an association to accept or decline membership based on certain criteria. It can be described as the right of a person coming together with other individuals to collectively express, promote, pursue and/or defend common interests. Freedom of association is both an individual right and a collective right, guaranteed by all modern and democratic legal systems, including the United States Bill of Rights, article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and international law, including articles 20 and 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 22 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work by the International Labour Organization also ensures these rights.

Freedom of association is manifested through the right to join a trade union, to engage in free speech or to participate in debating societies, political parties, or any other club or association, including religious denominations and organizations, fraternities, and sport clubs and not to be compelled to belong to an association. It is closely linked with freedom of assembly, particularly under the U.S. Bill of Rights. Freedom of assembly is typically associated with political contexts. However, (e.g. the U.S. Constitution, human rights instruments, etc.) the right to freedom of association may include the right to freedom of assembly. 

The courts and delegated officers of local jurisdictions may impose restrictions on any of the rights of a convicted criminal as a condition of a legal stipulation. Rights to freedom of association and freedom of assembly are waived under certain circumstances, such as a guilty plea or conviction, restraining orders and probationer&#x27;s search and seizure procedures. Freedom of association is also legally restricted in certain circumstances such as with the Civil Rights Act, in which private discrimination against certain protected classes was made illegal.

==History==
The general freedom to associate with groups according to the choice of the individual, and for the groups to take action to promote their interests, has been a necessary feature of every democratic society. Because freedom of association necessarily recognizes pluralistic sources of power and organisation, aside from the government, it has been a primary target for repression by all dictatorial societies. In the United Kingdom, all forms of &quot;combination&quot; were prohibited and criminal, particularly worker organisations, until the Combination Act 1825. After this, it was still not by the Companies Act 1856, the Trade Union Act 1871 and the Criminal Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 that companies and then trade unions became generally lawful. In Germany, a similar set of repressive laws were put in place against both trade unions and social democrat organisations by the Bismarck government under the &quot;Sozialistengesetze&quot; (the &quot;Socialist Acts&quot;) in 1878. These remained in force until 1890. In 1933, trade unions were once again prohibited by the Fascist dictatorship of Hitler&#x27;s National Socialist party, and the existing unions were nationalized and combined into a single government controlled German Labor Front. In West Germany after World War II, free trade unions were quickly resurrected and guaranteed by the German &quot;Grundgesetz&quot;. In the United States, trade unions were classified by various state courts, at various times, as being in restraint of trade. Under the Clayton Act of 1914, trade unions were given a general freedom to organize and to act collectively to secure collective agreements, however further hurdles were put in place until the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 created a comprehensive labor code.

==Law==

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===
Freedom of association is enshrined by Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Article 20:
=== Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ===
Section 2 of the Charter, under the heading of &quot;Fundamental Freedoms&quot;, states:

Under Canadian jurisprudence, freedom of association has three dimensions: the &quot;constitutive&quot; right to form associations with other people, a &quot;derivative&quot; right to collectively invoke other constitutional rights, and the &quot;purposive&quot; right to collectively bargain in order to be on equal footing with other groups and entities.

===European Convention===
===Italian Constitution===
In Italy the freedom of association is established in Article 18 of the Constitution, which states:

===South African Bill of Rights===
The South African Constitution&#x27;s Bill of Rights establishes the right to freedom of association in Section 18, which states &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of association.&quot; Furthermore, Section 17 states &quot;Everyone has the right, peacefully and unarmed, to assemble, to demonstrate, to picket and to present petitions&quot;, thus establishing the right to freedom of assembly. Workers&#x27; right to freedom of association in terms of the right to form trade unions and collective bargaining is recognized separately, in Section 23.

===United States Constitution===

While the United States Constitution&#x27;s First Amendment identifies the rights to assemble and to petition the government, the text of the First Amendment does not make specific mention of a right to association. Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court held in &quot;NAACP v. Alabama&quot; (1958) that freedom of association is an essential part of freedom of speech because, in many cases, people can engage in effective speech only when they join with others. Other Supreme Court cases involving freedom of association issues include:
* &quot;Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia&quot;, 377 U.S. 1 (1964)
* &quot;United Mine Workers v. Illinois State Bar Association&quot;, 389 U.S. 217 (1967)
* &quot;Healy v. James&quot;, 408 U.S. 169 (1972)
* &quot;NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.&quot;, 458 U.S. 898 (1982)
* &quot;Boy Scouts of America v. Dale&quot;, 530 U.S. 640 (2000)
* &quot;Janus v. AFSCME&quot;, No. 16-1466, 585 U.S. ___ (2018)

==Issues==

===Intimate association===
A fundamental element of personal liberty is the right to choose to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships. These intimate human relationships are considered forms of &quot;intimate association.&quot; The paradigmatic example of &quot;intimate association&quot; is the family. Depending on the jurisdiction it may also extend to abortion, birth control and private, adult, non-commercial and consensual sexual relationships.

===Expressive association===
In the United States, expressive associations are groups that engage in activities protected by the First Amendment – speech, assembly, press, petitioning government for a redress of grievances, and the free exercise of religion. In &quot;Roberts v. United States Jaycees&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court held that laws banning associations from excluding people for reasons unrelated to the group&#x27;s expression are constitutional. However, in the subsequent decisions of &quot;Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston&quot;, the Court ruled that a group may exclude people from membership if their presence would affect the group&#x27;s ability to advocate a particular point of view. The government cannot, through the use of anti-discrimination laws, force groups to include a message that they do not wish to convey.

This concept continues to apply broadly to private groups, notwithstanding the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Christian Legal Society v. Martinez&quot; (2010), which upheld Hastings College of Law policy that a student group on campus could not enjoy university recognition while excluding people from group activities by requiring them to undergo a religious test. The Court found that the school&#x27;s conditions on recognizing student groups were viewpoint neutral and reasonable. The policy requires student organizations to allow &quot;any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions, regardless of their status or beliefs&quot; and so, can be used to deny the group recognition as an official student organization because it had required its members to attest in writing that &quot;I believe in: The Bible as the inspired word of God; The Deity of our Lord, Jesus Christ, God&#x27;s son; The vicarious death of Jesus Christ for our sins; His bodily resurrection and His personal return; The presence and power of the Holy Spirit in the work of regeneration; [and] Jesus Christ, God&#x27;s son, is Lord of my life.&quot; The Court reasoned that Hastings sought to treat all student groups equally; the CLS, on the other hand, sought an exemption to apply a religious test to their membership. Thus, the college&#x27;s all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the student organization forum.

====Limitation====
The implicit First Amendment right of association in the U.S. Constitution has been limited by court rulings. For example, it is illegal in the United States to consider race in the making and enforcement of private contracts other than marriage. This limit on freedom of association results from Section 1981 of Title 42 of the United States Code, as balanced against the First Amendment in the 1976 decision of &quot;Runyon v. McCrary&quot;.

Governments often require contracts of adhesion with private entities for licensing purposes, such as with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for stock market trading in the 1938 Maloney Act amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These contracts often bar association with banned members, as can be seen in &quot;United States v. Merriam&quot;, 108 F.3d 1162.

===Organized labor===

The organization of labor was commonly resisted during the 19th century, with even relatively liberal countries such as the United Kingdom banning it for various periods (in the UK&#x27;s case, between 1820 and 1824).

In the international labour movement, the freedom of association is a right identified under international labour standards as the right of workers to organize and collectively bargain. Freedom of association, in this sense, is recognized as a fundamental human right by a number of documents including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organization Convention C87 and Convention C98 – two of the eight fundamental, core international labour standards. &#x27;Freedom of association&#x27; can also refer to legal bans on private contracts negotiated between a private employer and their employees requiring workers at a particular workplace to join a union as a term and condition of employment. Supporters of this sort of private freedom of association claim that the right to join a union incorporates a right not to join a union. In the United States, the term &#x27;right-to-work law&#x27; is more common for this type of law.

&quot;The Supreme Court today (1-21-1997) sharply limited the ability of labor union organizers to go onto an employer&#x27;s property to distribute literature or urge workers to join the union. In a 6-to-3 opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court said that the National Labor Relations Board had failed to give adequate protection to employers&#x27; property rights when it adopted a rule four years ago that gave union organizers greater access to areas like the parking lots of shopping centers or factories.&quot; -New York Times

==Theory==

===Democracy and civil society===
Jeremy McBride argues that respecting the freedom of association by all public authorities and the exercising of this freedom by all sections of society are essential both to establish a &quot;genuine democracy&quot; and to ensure that, once achieved, it remains &quot;healthy and flourishing&quot;. In this regard he sees the formation of political parties as a significant manifestation of the freedom of association.

The freedom of association is however not only exercised in the political sense, but also for a vast array of interests – such as culture, recreation, sport and social and humanitarian assistance. Jeremy McBride argues that the formation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which he equates with civil society, is the &quot;fruit of associational activity&quot;.

===Libertarian===
Right-libertarians believe that while freedom of association includes the right for workers to organise as unions and to withdraw their labour it also recognises the right of an employer to replace that labour. They also believe that where unions employ coercive or violent tactics, such behaviours would be in breach of both individual rights and property rights. Some critics of unionism allege that such breaches have frequently been the case with union activity.

<text>At the 1904 Summer Olympics, nine swimming events were contested. The 1904 swimming competition was the only time in Olympic history that racing distances were measured in yards. The competition was held September 4–6, 1904. There was a total of 32 participants from 5 countries competing. The 10 events at the swimming competitions were held at a man-made lake that was used for life-saving exhibitions by the coast guard.

The short sprint, at , made its first Olympic appearance in 1904. The 100 returned after not being contested in 1900. The 1000 metres and 4000 metres were replaced with the much shorter and events, making the 200 the only freestyle event to be held for the second time in a row.

The 200 metre backstroke was shortened to and the team swimming event was replaced with a 4 × 50 yard freestyle relay. The obstacle course and underwater swimming events were eliminated, while breaststroke made its Olympic debut.

<doc id="219596" wikidata="Q1321695" url="?curid=219596" title="Egg cell">
<text>The egg cell or ovum (: ova) is the female reproductive cell, or gamete, in most anisogamous organisms (organisms that reproduce sexually with a larger, female gamete and a smaller, male one). The term is used when the female gamete is not capable of movement (non-motile). If the male gamete (sperm) is capable of movement, the type of sexual reproduction is also classified as oogamous. A nonmotile female gamete formed in the oogonium of some algae, fungi, oomycetes, or bryophytes is an oosphere. When fertilized, the oosphere becomes the oospore.

When egg and sperm fuse during fertilisation, a diploid cell (the zygote) is formed, which rapidly grows into a new organism.

== History ==
While the non-mammalian animal egg was obvious, the doctrine &quot;ex ovo omne vivum&quot; (&quot;every living [animal comes from] an egg&quot;), associated with William Harvey (1578–1657), was a rejection of spontaneous generation and preformationism as well as a bold assumption that mammals also reproduced via eggs. Karl Ernst von Baer discovered the mammalian ovum in 1827. The fusion of spermatozoa with ova (of a starfish) was observed by Oskar Hertwig in 1876.

== Animals ==
In animals, egg cells are also known as &quot;ova&quot; (singular &quot;ovum&quot;, from the Latin word meaning &#x27;egg&#x27;). The term ovule in animals is used for the young ovum of an animal. In vertebrates, ova are produced by female gonads (sex glands) called ovaries. A number of ova are present at birth in mammals and mature via oogenesis.

Studies performed on humans, dogs, and cats in the 1870s suggested that the production of oocytes (immature egg cells) stops at or shortly after birth. A review of reports from 1900 to 1950 by zoologist Solomon Zuckerman cemented the belief that females have a finite number of oocytes that are formed before they are born. This dogma has been challenged by a number of studies since 2004. Several studies suggest that ovarian stem cells exist within the mammalian ovary. Whether or not mature mammals can actually create new egg cells remains uncertain and is an ongoing research question.

=== Mammals including humans ===


In all mammals, the ovum is fertilized inside the female body. Human ova grow from primitive germ cells that are embedded in the substance of the ovaries.

The ovum is one of the largest cells in the human body, typically visible to the naked eye without the aid of a microscope or other magnification device. The human ovum measures approximately in diameter.

In humans, recombination rates differ between maternal and paternal DNA:

* Maternal DNA: Recombines approximately 42 times on average.
* Paternal DNA: Recombines approximately 27 times on average.

=== Ooplasm ===
Ooplasm is like the yolk of the ovum, a cell substance at its center, which contains its nucleus, named the germinal vesicle, and the nucleolus, called the germinal disc.

The ooplasm consists of the cytoplasm of the ordinary animal cell with its spongioplasm and hyaloplasm, often called the &quot;formative yolk&quot;; and the &quot;nutritive yolk&quot; or &quot;deutoplasm&quot;, made of rounded granules of fatty and albuminoid substances imbedded in the cytoplasm.

Mammalian ova contain only a tiny amount of the nutritive yolk, for nourishing the embryo in the early stages of its development only. In contrast, bird eggs contain enough to supply the chick with nutriment throughout the whole period of incubation.

=== Ova development in oviparous animals ===
In the oviparous animals (all birds, most fish, amphibians and reptiles), the ova develop protective layers and pass through the oviduct to the outside of the body. They are fertilized by male sperm either inside the female body (as in birds), or outside (as in many fish). After fertilization, an embryo develops, nourished by nutrients contained in the egg. It then hatches from the egg, outside the mother&#x27;s body. See egg for a discussion of eggs of oviparous animals.

The egg cell&#x27;s cytoplasm and mitochondria are the sole means the egg can reproduce by mitosis and eventually form a blastocyst after fertilization.

===Ovoviviparity===
There is an intermediate form, the ovoviviparous animals: the embryo develops within and is nourished by an egg as in the oviparous case, but then it hatches inside the mother&#x27;s body shortly before birth, or just after the egg leaves the mother&#x27;s body. Some fish, reptiles and many invertebrates use this technique.

==Plants==
Nearly all land plants have alternating diploid and haploid generations. Gametes are produced by the haploid generation, which is known as the gametophyte. The female gametophyte produces structures called archegonia, and the egg cells form within them via mitosis. The typical bryophyte archegonium consists of a long neck with a wider base containing the egg cell. Upon maturation, the neck opens to allow sperm cells to swim into the archegonium and fertilize the egg. The resulting zygote then gives rise to an embryo, which will grow into a new diploid individual, known as a sporophyte. In seed plants, a structure called the ovule contains the female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an egg cell. After fertilization, the ovule develops into a seed containing the embryo.

In flowering plants, the female gametophyte (sometimes referred to as the embryo sac) has been reduced to just eight cells inside the ovule. The gametophyte cell closest to the micropyle opening of the ovule develops into the egg cell. Upon pollination, a pollen tube delivers sperm into the gametophyte and one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo inside the ovule. The ovule, in turn, develops into a seed and in many cases, the plant ovary develops into a fruit to facilitate the dispersal of the seeds. Upon germination, the embryo grows into a seedling.

In the moss &quot;Physcomitrella patens&quot;, the Polycomb protein FIE is expressed in the unfertilised egg cell (Figure, right) as the blue colour after GUS staining reveals. Soon after fertilisation the FIE gene is inactivated (the blue colour is no longer visible, left) in the young embryo.

==Other organisms==
In algae, the egg cell is often called oosphere. &quot;Drosophila&quot; oocytes develop in individual egg chambers that are supported by nurse cells and surrounded by somatic follicle cells. The nurse cells are large polyploid cells that synthesize and transfer RNA, proteins, and organelles to the oocytes. This transfer is followed by the programmed cell death (apoptosis) of the nurse cells. During oogenesis, 15 nurse cells die for every oocyte that is produced. In addition to this developmentally regulated cell death, egg cells may also undergo apoptosis in response to starvation and other insults.

<text>A tug of war competition was held August 31 and September 1 at Francis Field in St. Louis, Missouri, as part of the 1904 Summer Olympics. Thirty athletes participated from six teams across three countries, and six games were played. Four American teams took the top four places, followed by Greek and South African teams unplaced.

==Background==
Tug of war was first held during the 1900 Olympics, when it was won by a mixed team from Scandinavia, featuring three Danish and three Swedish athletes. For the 1904 games in St. Louis, six teams entered. Four of the teams were representing the host nation, the United States, while there were also teams from Greece and South Africa. For the United States, the Milwaukee Athletic Club entered a team, the Southwest Turnverein of St. Louis entered two teams, and the New York Athletic Club were the final entrant. A team from the Pan-Hellenic Athletic Club represented Greece, while South Africa was represented by the Boer Team. The contests were held on turf ground with no shoes on, over a period of five minutes. If within that five minutes, a team succeeded in pulling the other team across a line from their starting position, they were deemed to win. Otherwise, the team that had pulled their opponents closest to the line after five minutes would be the winner. Three local judges were selected to officiate in the competition; Clark Hetherington of the University of Missouri, and John Meyers and Myles McDonough, both of St. Louis.

==Results==
August 30 was the first day of the tug-of-war competition, with the two quarterfinal matches and the first semi-final match (between the two teams who had byes in the quarterfinals) being held. The rest of the competition was conducted on 1 September.

===Quarterfinals===

Losers were eliminated.

===Semifinals===

The losers were sent to the repechage to face each other: the winner would face the loser of the final for second place.

===Final===

The winner received the gold medal, while the loser had to face the winner of the repechage in the silver medal match.

===Silver medal semifinal===

The winner of this match faced the loser of the final for the silver medal.

===Silver and bronze medal matches===

The New York team failed to appear for either the silver medal match or the bronze medal match: both matches were scratched, with the silver medal being awarded to the Saint Louis No. 1 team and the bronze medal being awarded to the Saint Louis No. 2 team.

==Final standings==

==Participating nations==
6 teams of 5, for a total of 30 athletes, competed. The host team had four teams, and two other nations each sent one.

<doc id="219599" wikidata="Q215627" url="?curid=219599" title="Person">
<text>A person (: [[people]] or persons, depending on context) is a being who has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. The defining features of personhood and, consequently, what makes a person count as a person, differ widely among cultures and contexts.

In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.

The plural form &quot;people&quot; is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in &quot;a people&quot;), and this was the original meaning of the word; it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person. The plural form &quot;persons&quot; is often used in philosophical and legal writing.

==Personhood==


Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law, and is closely tied to legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.
Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of slavery and the fight for women&#x27;s rights, in debates about abortion, fetal rights, and in animal rights advocacy.

Various debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, postnatal humans are defined as persons. Likewise, certain legal entities such as corporations, sovereign states and other polities, or estates in probate are legally defined as persons. However, some people believe that other groups should be included; depending on the theory, the category of &quot;person&quot; may be taken to include or not pre-natal humans or such non-human entities as animals, artificial intelligences, or extraterrestrial life.

==Personal identity==

Personal identity is the unique identity of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the &quot;same&quot; person, persisting through time. In the modern philosophy of mind, this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the &quot;&quot; problem of personal identity. The &quot;&quot; problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.

Identity is an issue for both continental philosophy and analytic philosophy. A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.

Proposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory, the bundle theory of self, continuity of personality after the death of the physical body, and proposals that there are actually no persons or selves who persist over time at all.

==Development of the concept==

In ancient Rome, the word &quot;persona&quot; (Latin) or &quot;prosopon&quot; (; Ancient Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various &quot;personae&quot; in the stage play.

The concept of person was further developed during the Trinitarian and Christological debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature. During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the logos (/&quot;Verbum&quot;) and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word &quot;prosopon&quot; () from the Greek theatre. Therefore, the logos (the /&quot;Verbum&quot;), which was identified with the Christ, was defined as a &quot;person&quot; of God. This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings. Trinitarianism holds that God has three persons.

Since then, a number of important changes to the word&#x27;s meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence. According to Jörg Noller, at least six approaches can be distinguished:

# &quot;The ontological definition of the person as &quot;an individual substance of a rational nature&quot; (Boethius).
# The self-consciousness-based definition of the person as a being that &quot;can conceive itself as itself&quot; (John Locke).
# The moral-philosophical definition of the person as &quot;an end in itself&quot; (Immanuel Kant). In current analytical debate, the focus has shifted to the relationship between bodily organism and person.
# The theory of animalism (Eric T. Olson) states that persons are essentially animals and that mental or psychological attributes play no role in their identity.
# Constitution theory (Lynne Baker), on the other hand, attempts to define the person as a natural and at the same time self-conscious being: the bodily organism constitutes the person without being identical to it. Rather, it forms with it a &quot;unity without identity&quot;.
# [... Another idea] for conceiving the natural-rational unity of the person has emerged recently in the concept of the &quot;person life&quot; (Marya Schechtman).&quot;

Other theories attribute personhood to those states that are viewed to possess intrinsic or universal value. Value theory attempts to capture those states that are universally considered valuable by their nature, allowing one to assign the concept of personhood upon those states. For example, Chris Kelly argues that the value that is intuitively bestowed upon humans, their possessions, animals, and aspects of the natural environment is due to a value monism known as &quot;richness.&quot; Richness, Kelly argues, is a product of the &quot;variety&quot; and the &quot;unity&quot; within an entity or agent. According to Kelly, human beings and animals are morally valued and entitled to the status of persons because they are complex organisms whose multitude of psychological and biological components are generally unified towards a singular purpose in any moment, existing and operating with relative harmony.

Primus defines people exclusively as their desires, whereby desires are states which are sought for arbitrary or nil purpose(s). Primus views that desires, by definition, are each sought as ends in and of themselves and are logically the most precious (valuable) states that one can conceive. Primus distinguishes states of desire (or &#x27;want&#x27;) from states which are sought instrumentally, as a means to an end (on the basis of perceived &#x27;need&#x27;). Primus&#x27; approach can thus be contrasted to Kant&#x27;s moral-philosophical definition of a person: whereas Kant&#x27;s second formulation of the categorical imperative states that rational beings must never be treated merely as a means to an end and that they must also always be treated as an end, Primus offers that the aspects that humans (and some animals) desire, and only those aspects, are ends, by definition.

<text>At the 1904 Summer Olympics, a water polo tournament was contested, with three club teams of seven players each. A German team tried to enter, but its entry was refused because their players did not play for the same club.

The event took place in an artificial lake in Forest Park, the location of both the Olympics and the World&#x27;s Fair. Two of the Olympians died of typhoid fever soon after the competition, possibly from contamination caused by livestock at the opposite end of the lake.

Previously, the International Olympic Committee and International Swimming Federation (FINA) considered the water polo event at the 1904 Olympics as a demonstration sport. However, in July 2021, after accepting the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon, the IOC recognized water polo along with several others as an official sport of the 1904 Olympic program.

<text>At the 1904 Summer Olympics, seven wrestling events were contested, all in the freestyle discipline. Then known as catch wrestling, it was the first time freestyle wrestling was featured at the Olympic Games, as the first Olympic wrestling contests in 1896 had been in the Greco-Roman style. Weight classes also made their first appearance. The sport continues to be in the Olympic program to the present day. The event also doubled as that year&#x27;s Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Catch Wrestling Championships.

==Medal summary==
==Participating nations==

A total of 44 wrestlers competed at the St. Louis Games:

* 

The nationalities of some medalists are disputed, as many American competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted U.S. citizenship.

The International Olympic Committee formerly considered Norwegian-American wrestlers Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen to have competed for the United States. Each man won a gold medal. In 2012, Norwegian historians found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, and that Hansen probably never received American citizenship. The historians have therefore petitioned the IOC to have the athletes registered as Norwegians, which was done.

<text>Lörrach is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the southwest of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald and Waldshut. To the west it borders the French &quot;département&quot; Haut-Rhin; to the south the Swiss cantons Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft and Aargau.

==History==
In 1973 part of the district Müllheim and small parts of the district Säckingen were added to the district, which enlarged the district by about 25% to the current size.

==Geography==
The north-east of the district is part of the &quot;Hochschwarzwald&quot;, the highest part of the Black Forest. In the west is the &quot;Markgräfler Hügelland&quot;, in the south the &quot;Dinkelberg&quot;, both lower hilly areas. The Rhine river, which forms most of the district&#x27;s southern and western border, is in a narrow valley until it spreads north of Basel in the much wider &quot;Oberrheinebene&quot;. The district is included in the trinational Basel metropolitan area.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the Lörrach district can be blazoned as &quot;Per fess Argent a Demi Lion facing sinister Gules and in base per pale Or a Bend Gules and Azure a Bend Sinister wavy Argent&quot;. The lion in the top part of the coat of arms represents the Lords of Rötteln, who had their primary castle in Loerrach, Wiesental. The bottom-left shows the coat of Baden, as much of the district belonged to the Counts of Baden historically. The wavy line in the bottom-right represents the small river Wiese, which flows through the district.

<doc id="219614" wikidata="Q148600" url="?curid=219614" title="Panicle">
<text>In botany, a panicle is a much-branched inflorescence. Some authors distinguish it from a compound spike inflorescence, by requiring that the flowers (and fruit) be pedicellate (having a single stem per flower). The branches of a panicle are often racemes. A panicle may have determinate or indeterminate growth.

This type of inflorescence is largely characteristic of grasses, such as oat and crabgrass, as well as other plants such as pistachio and mamoncillo. Botanists use the term paniculate in two ways: &quot;having a true panicle inflorescence&quot; as well as &quot;having an inflorescence with the form but not necessarily the structure of a panicle&quot;.

==Corymb==
A corymb may have a paniculate branching structure, with the lower flowers having longer pedicels than the upper, thus giving a flattish top superficially resembling an umbel. Many species in the subfamily Amygdaloideae, such as hawthorns and rowans, produce their flowers in corymbs.

<text>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (; ), called in English Poliphilo&#x27;s Strife of Love in a Dream or The Dream of Poliphilus, is a book said to be by Francesco Colonna. It is a famous example of an incunable (a work of early printing). The work was first published in 1499 in Venice by Aldus Manutius. This first edition has an elegant page layout, with refined woodcut illustrations in an Early Renaissance style. &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; presents a mysterious arcane allegory in which the main protagonist, Poliphilo, pursues his love, Polia, through a dreamlike landscape. In the end, he is reconciled with her by the &quot;Fountain of Venus&quot;.

==History==

The &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; was printed by Aldus Manutius in Venice in December 1499. The author of the book is anonymous. However, an acrostic formed by the first, elaborately decorated letter in each chapter in the original Italian reads &quot;POLIAM FRATER FRANCISCVS COLVMNA PERAMAVIT&quot;, which means &quot;Brother Francesco Colonna has dearly loved Polia&quot;. Despite this clue, the book has also been attributed to Leon Battista Alberti, and earlier, to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. Manutius himself claimed that the author was a different Francesco Colonna, a wealthy Roman governor. The identity of the illustrator has at times been attributed to Benedetto Montagna, and Sandro Botticelli.

The subject matter of the book lies within the tradition (or genre) of the Romance. It follows the conventions of courtly love, which in 1499 continued to provide engaging thematic matter for the Quattrocento aristocrats. The &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; also draws from Renaissance humanism where arcane writings are a demonstration of classical thought.

The text of the book is written in a bizarre Latinate Italian. Without explanation, the text is full of words based on Latin and Greek roots. The book, however, also includes words from the Italian language and illustrations which include Arabic and Hebrew words. Moreover, Colonna would invent new forms of language when those available to him were inaccurate. The book also contains some uses of Egyptian hieroglyphs, but they are not authentic. Most of them have been drawn from a late antique text of dubious origin called &quot;Hieroglyphica&quot;.

The &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot;, set in 1467, consists of a series of precious and elaborate scenes involving the title character, Poliphilo (&quot;friend of many things&quot; from the Greek words &quot;poly-&quot; meaning &quot;many&quot; and &quot;philos&quot; meaning &quot;friend&quot;). In these scenes, Poliphilo wanders a bucolic-classical dreamland in search of his love, Polia (&quot;many things&quot;). The author&#x27;s style is elaborately descriptive and unsparing in its use of superlatives. The text makes frequent references to classical geography and mythology, mostly by way of comparison.

The book has long been sought after as one of the most beautiful incunabula ever printed. The typography is famous for its quality and clarity. Its roman typeface, cut by Francesco Griffo, is a revised version of a type which Aldus had first used in 1496 for the &quot;De Aetna&quot; of Pietro Bembo. The type is thought to be one of the first examples of the roman typeface, and in incunabula, it is unique to the Aldine Press. The type was revived by the Monotype Corporation in 1923 as &quot;Poliphilus&quot;. In 1929, Stanley Morison directed another revival of the earlier version of Griffo&#x27;s type. It was called &quot;Bembo&quot;.

The &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; is illustrated with 168 exquisite woodcuts showing the scenery, architectural settings, and some of the characters Poliphilo encounters in his dreams. They depict scenes from Poliphilo&#x27;s adventures and the architectural features over which the author rhapsodizes, in a simultaneously stark and ornate line art style. This integrates perfectly with the type, an example of typographic art.

The illustrations are interesting because they shed light on the Renaissance man&#x27;s taste in the æsthetic qualities of Greek and Roman antiquities. In the United States, a book on the life and works of Aldus Manutius by Helen Barolini was set within pages that reproduce all the illustrations and many of the full pages from the original work, reconstructing the original layout.

The psychologist Carl Jung admired the book, believing the dream images presaged his theory of archetypes. The style of the woodcut illustrations had a great influence on late nineteenth century English illustrators, such as Aubrey Beardsley, Walter Crane, and Robert Anning Bell.

In 1592, in a London edition, &quot;R. D.&quot; (who is believed to be Robert Dallington) partially translated the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot;. Here, it was given its best known English title, &quot;The Strife of Love in a Dream&quot;. In 1999, a first complete English translation by musicologist Joscelyn Godwin was published. However his translation uses standard, modern language, rather than following the original text&#x27;s pattern of coining and borrowing words.

Since the 500th anniversary in 1999, several other modern translations have been published. These include a translation into modern Italian as part of the (volume 1: fac-simile; volume 2: translation, introductory essays and more than 700 pages of commentary) edition by Marco Ariani and Mino Gabriele; into Spanish by Pilar Pedraza Martínez; into Dutch with one volume of commentary by Ike Cialona; into German, with commentary inserted into the text, by Thomas Reiser; and partly into Polish by Anna Klimkiewicz.

A complete Russian translation by the art historian Boris Sokolov is now in progress, of which the &quot;Cythera Island&quot; part was published in 2005 and is available online. The book is planned as a precise reconstruction of the original layout, with Cyrillic types and typography by Sergei Egorov.

Ten of the monuments described in the &quot;Hypnerotomachia&quot; were reconstructed with computer graphics and were first published by Esteban A. Cruz in 2006 and in 2012. In 2007, Cruz established a full, design-study project &quot;Formas Imaginisque Poliphili&quot;, an ongoing independent research project with the objective of reconstructing the content of the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot;, through a multi-disciplinary approach, and with the aid of virtual and traditional reconstruction technology and methods.

==Plot summary==
The book begins with Poliphilo, who is spending a restless dream-filled night because his beloved, Polia, has shunned him. Poliphilo is transported into a wild forest, where he becomes lost, encounters dragons, wolves and maidens and a large variety of architectural forms. He escapes, and falls asleep once more.

He then awakens in a second dream, a dream within the first. He is taken by nymphs to meet their queen, and there he is asked to declare his love for Polia, which he does. He is then directed by two nymphs to three gates. He chooses the third, and there he discovers his beloved. They are taken by some more nymphs to a temple to be engaged. Along the way they come across five triumphal processions celebrating their union. They are then taken to the island of Cythera by barge, on which Cupid is the boatswain. On Cythera, they see another triumphal procession celebrating their union. The narrative is interrupted, and assumed by a second voice, as Polia describes Poliphilo&#x27;s erotomania from her own point of view.

Poliphilo then resumes his narrative (from one-fifth of the way through the book). Polia rejects Poliphilo, but Cupid appears to her in a vision and compels her to return and kiss Poliphilo, who has fallen into a deathlike swoon at her feet. Her kiss revives him. Venus blesses their love, and Poliphilo and Polia are united at last. As Poliphilo is about to take Polia into his arms, Polia vanishes into thin air and Poliphilo wakes up.

<doc id="219619" wikidata="Q318156" url="?curid=219619" title="Bahawalpur">
<text>Bahawalpur (Urdu: ; ) is a city in Punjab, Pakistan. It is the 13th largest city of Pakistan and 8th most populous city of Punjab. Bahawalpur is the capital of Bahawalpur Division.

Founded in 1748 by the Daudpotra family of Sindh, Bahawalpur was the capital of the former princely state of Bahawalpur, ruled by the &quot;Nawabs of Bahawalpur&quot; until 1955. The &quot;Nawabs&quot; left a rich architectural legacy, and Bahawalpur is known for its monuments dating from that period. The city lies at the edge of the Cholistan Desert, and serves as the gateway to the nearby Lal Suhanra National Park.

==History==
Bahawalpur was among the 584 princely states before the Partition of India. 
=== Early history ===

Bahawalpur State was home to various ancient societies. The Bahawalpur region was part of Multan province of Mughal Empire in recent history. It contains ruins from the Indus Valley civilisation, as well as ancient Buddhist sites such as the nearby Patan minara. British archaeologist Sir Alexander Cunningham identified the Bahawalpur region as home of the Yaudheya kingdoms of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. Prior to the establishment of Bahawalpur, Cholistan region&#x27;s major city was Uch Sharif – a regional metropolitan centre between the 12th and 17th centuries that is renowned for its collection of historic shrines dedicated to Muslim mystics from the 12–15th centuries built in the region&#x27;s vernacular style.

==== Establishment ====
Bahawalpur was established in 1748 by Nawab Bahawal Khan I, after he migrated to the region around Uch from Shikarpur, Sindh. Bahawalpur replaced Derawar as the clan&#x27;s capital city. The city initially flourished as a trading post on trade routes between Afghanistan and central India.

==== Durrani Attacks ====
In 1785, the Durrani commander Sirdar Khan attacked Bahawalpur city and destroyed many of its buildings on behalf of Mian Abdul Nabi Kalhora of Sindh. Bahawalpur&#x27;s ruling family, along with nobles from nearby Uch, were forced to take refuge in the Derawar Fort, where they successfully repulsed further attacks. The attacking Durrani force accepted 60,000 rupees as &quot;nazrana&quot; or tribute, though Bahawal Khan later had to seek refuge in the Rajput states as the Afghan Durranis occupied Derawar Fort. Bahawal Khan returned to conquer the fort by way of Uch, and re-established control of Bahawalpur.

==== Princely state ====


The princely state of Bahawalpur was founded in 1802 by Nawab Mohammad Bahawal Khan II after the break-up of the Durrani Empire, and was based in the city.

==== Sikh Attacks and treaties with the British ====
In 1807, Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire laid siege to the fort in Multan, prompting refugees to seek safety in Bahawalpur in the wake of his marauding forces that began to attack the countryside around Multan. Ranjit Singh eventually withdrew the siege, and gave the Nawab of Bahawalpur some gifts as the Sikh forces retreated.

Bahalwapur offered an outpost of stability in the wake of crumbling Mughal rule and the declining power of Khorasan&#x27;s monarchy. The city became a refuge for prominent families from affected regions and also saw an influx of religious scholars escaping the consolidation of Sikh power in Punjab.

Fearing an invasion from the Sikh Empire, Nawab Mohammad Bahawal Khan III signed a treaty with the British on 22 February 1833, guaranteeing the independence of the &quot;Nawab&quot; and the autonomy of Bahawalpur as a princely state. The treaty guaranteed the British a friendly southern frontier during their invasion of the Sikh Empire.

==== Trade Routes ====
Trade routes had shifted away from Bahawalpur by the 1830s, and British visitors to the city noted several empty shops in the city&#x27;s bazaar. The population at this time was estimated to be 20,000, and was noted to be made up primarily of Hindus. Also in 1833, the Sutlej and Indus Rivers were opened to navigation, allowing goods to reach Bahawalpur. By 1845, newly opened trade routes to Delhi re-established Bahawalpur as a commercial centre. The city was known in the late 19th century as a centre for the production of silk goods, &quot;lungis&quot;, and cotton goods. The city&#x27;s silk was noted to be of higher quality than silk works from Benares or Amritsar.

==== Increased British Influence ====
An 1866 crisis over succession to the Bahawalpur throne markedly increased British influence in the princely state. Bahawalpur was constituted as a municipality in 1874. Bahalwapur&#x27;s Nawab celebrated the Golden Jubillee of Queen Victoria in 1887 in a state function at the Noor Mahal palace. In 1901, the population of the city was 18,546.

===== The Second World War =====
At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Bahawalpur&#x27;s Nawab was the first ruler of a princely state to offer his full support and resources of the state towards the crown&#x27;s war efforts.

=== Joining Pakistan ===

British Princely states were given the option to join either Pakistan or India upon British withdrawal from the Sub-Continent in August 1947. The city and the princely state of Bahawalpur acceded to Pakistan on 7 October 1947, under Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi V Bahadur.

<text>The bird family Petroicidae includes 51 species in 19 genera. All are endemic to Australasia: New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand and numerous Pacific Islands as far east as Samoa. For want of an accurate common name, the family is often called the Australasian robins. 
Within the family species are known variously as robins, scrub-robins and flyrobins. They are only distantly related to the European robin of Europe, north Africa and western Asia, a member of family Muscicapidae.

==Characteristics==
Most species have a compact build with a large, rounded head, a short, straight bill, and rounded wingtips. They occupy a wide range of wooded habitats, from subalpine to tropical rainforest, and mangrove swamps to semi-arid scrubland. All are primarily insectivorous, although a few supplement their diet with seeds. Hunting is mostly by perch and pounce, a favoured tactic being to cling sideways onto a treetrunk and scan the ground below without moving.

Social organisation is usually centered on long-term pair-bonds and small family groups. Most members of the subfamily Eopsaltrinae practice cooperative breeding, with all family members helping defend a territory and feed nestlings.

Nests are cup-shaped, usually constructed by the female, and often placed in a vertical fork of a tree or shrub. Many species are expert at adding moss, bark or lichen to the outside of the nest as camouflage, making it very difficult to spot, even when it is in a seemingly prominent location.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Australasian robin family was first introduced in 1888, as a subfamily with the spelling Petroecinae, by the English ornithologist Alfred Newton.

Although named after true robins, the Australian robins, along with many other insect-eating birds, were originally classified as flycatchers in a huge family Muscicapidae. They were also classified for a time in the whistler family Pachycephalidae, before being placed in their own family Petroicidae, or Eopsaltridae.

The family Petroicidae is a member of the infraorder Passerides which also includes the parvorders Sylviida, Muscicapida and Passerida. It is most closely related to the families Eupetidae (Rail-babbler), Chaetopidae (Rockjumper) and Picathartidae (Rockfowl).

==Classification==
A comprehensive review, including an analysis of the osteological characters, by Schodde and Mason in 1999 illustrated three groupings, classified as subfamilies below: Testing of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA revealed some changes, and proposed sinking of &quot;Tregellasia&quot; into &quot;Eopsaltria&quot; as the white-breasted robin&#x27;s closest relatives appear to be the two taxa of &quot;Tregellasia&quot;.

The family contains 51 species divided into 19 genera and 6 subfamilies:
*Eopsaltriinae
** &quot;Tregellasia&quot; (2 species)
** &quot;Quoyornis&quot; (monotypic) – white-breasted robin
** &quot;Eopsaltria&quot; (2 species)
** &quot;Gennaeodryas&quot; (monotypic) – banded yellow robin
** &quot;Melanodryas&quot; (2 species)
** &quot;Peneothello&quot; (5 species)
** &quot;Poecilodryas&quot; (4 species)
** &quot;Plesiodryas&quot; (monotypic) – black-throated robin
** &quot;Heteromyias&quot; (3 species)
*Drymodinae
** &quot;Drymodes&quot; (3 species)
*Microecinae
** &quot;Microeca&quot; (3 species)
** &quot;Monachella&quot; (monotypic) – torrent flyrobin
** &quot;Cryptomicroeca&quot; (monotypic) – yellow-bellied flyrobin
** &quot;Kempiella&quot; (2 species)
** &quot;Devioeca&quot; (monotypic) – canary flyrobin
*Petroicinae
** &quot;Eugerygone&quot; (monotypic) – garnet robin
** &quot;Petroica&quot; (14 species)
*Pachycephalopsinae
** &quot;Pachycephalopsis&quot; (2 species)
*Amalocichlinae
** &quot;Amalocichla&quot; (2 species)

<text>The Valaam Monastery (; ) is a stauropegic Orthodox monastery in Russian Karelia, located on Valaam, the largest island in Lake Ladoga, the largest lake in Europe.

==History==

It is not clear when the monastery was founded, as the cloister is not mentioned in documents before the 16th century. Dates from the 10th to the 15th centuries having been suggested. According to one tradition, the monastery was founded by a 10th-century Greek monk, Sergius of Valaam, and his Karelian companion, Herman of Valaam. Heikki Kirkinen dated the foundation of the monastery to the 12th century. Contemporary historians consider even this date too early. According to the scholarly consensus, the monastery was founded at some point towards the end of the 14th century. John H. Lind and Michael C. Paul date the founding to between 1389 and 1393 based on various sources, including the &quot;Tale of the Valamo Monastery&quot;, a sixteenth-century manuscript discovered in 1989, which has the monastery founded during the archiepiscopate of Ioann II of Novgorod.

The monastery was a northern outpost of the Eastern Orthodox Church against pagans and, later, a western outpost against the Catholic Church from Tavastia, Savonia and Karelia Province. The power struggle between Russians and Swedes pushed the border eastwards in the 16th century; in 1578 the monastery was attacked and numerous monks and novices were killed by the Lutheran Swedes. The monastery was left desolate between 1611 and 1715 after another attack by the Swedes, with buildings being burned to the ground and the Karelian border between Russia and Sweden being drawn through Lake Ladoga. In the 18th century the monastery was magnificently restored, and in 1812 it came under the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland.

In 1917, Finland became independent, and the Finnish Orthodox Church became autonomous under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople; previously, it had been a part of the Russian Orthodox Church. Valaam was the most important monastery of the Finnish Orthodox Church. The liturgic language was changed from Church Slavonic to Finnish and the liturgic calendar from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. These changes led to bitter decades-long disputes in the monastic community of Valaam.
The territory was fought over by the Soviet Union and Finland during World War II. Due to the Winter War, the monastery was evacuated in 1940, when 150 monks settled in Heinävesi in Finland. This community still exists as New Valamo Monastery in Heinävesi. Having received evacuees from the Konevsky Monastery and Pechenga Monastery, it is now the only monastery of the Finnish Orthodox Church, alongside the Lintula Holy Trinity Convent located just 14 km away. From 1941 to 1944, during the Continuation War, an attempt was made to restore the monastery buildings at Old Valaam, but later the island served as a Soviet military base.

Since the original Valaam Monastery was bequeathed back to the Orthodox Church in 1989, it has been enjoying the personal patronage of Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow, who frequented the cloister as a child. The monastery, whose buildings have been meticulously restored, has gained significant legal power over the island in a push to return to a state of spiritual seclusion. After years of fruitless legal proceedings with the monastery, many residents of the island chose to leave, though a few still remain. The present Father Superior of the community is Bishop Pankraty (Zherdev) of Troitsk.

==Valaam chant==

The monastery of Valaam has a unique tradition of singing, called the Valaam chant, that combines some features of Byzantine and Znamenny chants.

As in Byzantine chant, the singing is always in 2-parts, comprising a melody and an ison, but, as in Znamenny chant, the scale structure is always diatonic. The ornamentation is simplified in comparison with Byzantine chant, and the melodies are more similar to that of ancient Znamenny Chant, at the edge of being considered a local variety of this tradition. This relative simplicity became one of the reasons for the experimental introduction of Valaam chanting in various parishes across Russia by the end of 20th century.

The monastery has a professional five-strong male-voice choir which tours the world to raise money for the ongoing restoration of the buildings. Some of its music can be heard at the monastery&#x27;s website.

==2016 fire==
On the morning of 1 May 2016, Pascha (Orthodox Easter Sunday), a blaze covering 800 square metres erupted on the monastery&#x27;s property, inside the “Winter Hotel&quot;, a national heritage site constructed in the 1850s. Belonging to the Valaam monastery, the building is located immediately adjacent to the monastery&#x27;s main cathedral. Emergency services reported no casualties from the incident.

<text>Elamkulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad (13 June 1909 – 19 March 1998), popularly known as ″E.M.S. Namboodiripad″ or simply by his initials ″E. M. S.″, was an Indian communist politician and theorist, who served as the first Chief Minister of Kerala in 1957–1959 and then again in 1967–1969. As a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI), he became the first non-Congress Chief Minister in the Indian republic. In 1964, he led a faction of the CPI that broke away to form the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). 

As chief minister, EMS pioneered radical land and educational reforms in Kerala, which helped it become the country&#x27;s leader in social indicators. It is largely due to his commitment and guidance that the CPI(M), of which he was Politburo member and general secretary for 14 years, has become such a domineering political force, playing a vital role in India&#x27;s new era of coalition politics.

== Early life ==
E. M. Sankaran Namboodiripad was born on 13 June 1909, as the fourth son of Parameswaran Namboodiripad and Vishnudatha Antharjanam, at Elamkulam, situated on the banks of Thuthapuzha River, in Perinthalmanna taluk of the present Malappuram district. He belonged to a prominent Malayali Nambudiri Brahmin family. His two elder brothers died before he was born, and the third brother was intellectually disabled. He lost his father when he was five. 

During the 1921 Malabar rebellion he moved to Irinjalakuda as the belligerent attacked his house. In his early years, he was a close friend of Sr. P.M. Mathew. He was associated with V. T. Bhattathiripad, M. R. Bhattathiripad and many others in the fight against the casteism and conservatism that existed in the Namboothiri community. He became one of the office-bearers of Valluvanadu Yogaskshema Sabha, an organization of progressive Namboothiri youth.

Namboodiripad graduated from St. Thomas College, Thrissur. During his college days, he was deeply associated with the Indian National Congress and the Indian independence movement. It is said he would walk 5–8 km to hear the firebrand Cochin politician V.J Mathai speak.

Namboodiripad was well known for his stammer. When asked if he always stammered, he would reply, &quot;No, only when I speak.&quot;

== Socialism ==

In 1934, he was one of the founders of Congress Socialist Party, a socialist wing within the Indian National Congress, and elected as its All India Joint Secretary from 1934 to 1940. He edited the Malayalam newspaper &quot;Prabhatham&quot; which was the organ of the Congress Socialist Party in Kerala. During this period, he was also elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly (1939).

He remained committed to socialist ideals, and his compassion towards the working class led him to join the Communist movement. The Indian government considered him to be one of the founders of the Communist Party of India (CPI) in Kerala, forcing him to go into hiding. During the 1962 Sino-Indian war, he was among leaders who aired China&#x27;s view on the border issue. When the CPI split in 1964, EMS stood with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). He was the leader of the Kerala state committee of CPI(M). He served as a member of the Central Committee and the Politburo of the CPI(M) until his death in 1998. EMS became general secretary in 1977, a designation he held until 1992. A Marxist scholar, he influenced the development of Kerala, of which he was the first chief minister.

== Election to state government ==

Kerala Assembly Election Results

A Communist-led government under E. M. S. Namboodiripad resulted from the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957, making him the first communist leader in India to head a popularly elected government. It was the second ever Communist government to be democratically elected, after Communist success in the 1945 elections in the Republic of San Marino, a microstate in Europe. On 5 April 1957 he was appointed as the first chief minister of Kerala. His government introduced the Land Reform Ordinance and Education Bill. In 1958, a period of anticommunist protest, the Vimochana Samaram, began in response to the bills. The central government of India responded in 1959 by invoking Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, suspending state government and imposing President&#x27;s rule.
Initially, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was hesitant to dismiss a democratically elected government, but he was convinced by his daughter Indira Gandhi. Involvement by the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s in the ouster has been long suspected. Declassified CIA documents show that the establishment of communist state governments in India concerned them and &quot;preventing additional Keralas became an important argument for augmenting U.S. assistance to India&quot;. According to the biography of former US Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, &quot;the election results rang alarm bells in Washington&quot;.

Namboodiripad became the Chief Minister of Kerala for the second time in 1967 as the leader of a seven-party coalition (Saptakakshi Munnani) which included the CPI and Muslim League. Soon after becoming Chief Minister again, on 31 January 1968 he inaugurated a mechanized coir factory called Floorco in Pozhikkara, Paravur. This time Namboodiripad&#x27;s tenure lasted for two and a half years, and the government fell on 24 October 1969 due to internal conflicts within the constituent parties.

Namboodiripad was the Leader of Opposition in the Kerala Legislative Assembly from 1960 to 1964 and again from 1970 to 1977. His vision of decentralization of power and resources (People&#x27;s Plan) and the Kerala Literacy Movement influenced Kerala society. He authored several books in English and Malayalam. Chintha Publication, Kerala has published all his books under the title, &quot;E M S Sanchika&quot;. He also was well known as a journalist.

==As the head of ministries in the Kerala State Assembly==
E. M. S. has led 2 ministries in Kerala.
== Sino-Indian war and split in the Communist Party==
During the 1962 Sino-Indian war, other parties portrayed left-wing parties as pro-China, since both were Communist. Namboodiripad stated that the left was focused on solving the border dispute through talks.

== Association with Progressive Movement for Arts and Letters ==
Namboodiripad, Kesari Balakrishna Pillai, Joseph Mundassery, M. P. Paul and K. Damodaran were architects of &quot;JeevalSahitya Prastanam&quot;, renamed Purogamana Sahitya Prastanam (Progressive Association for Arts and Letters). Though the party considered Kesari one of the visionaries of the Progressive Movement for Arts and Letters in Kerala, serious differences of opinion emerged between full-time Communist Party activists and other personalities, namely Kesari and Mundassery. In this context, Namboodiripad famously accused Kesari of being a &quot;petit-bourgeois intellectual&quot;, an appellation he retracted. Namboodiripad also acknowledged some of the earlier misconceptions of the Communist Party with respect to the Progressive Literature and Arts Movement. This debate is known as &quot;Rupa Bhadrata Vivadam&quot;, an important milestone in the growth of modern Malayalam literature.

== Death ==
Despite his age and failing health, Namboodiripad was still active in political and social fields. He actively campaigned during the 1998 general election. Soon after the results were declared, he contracted pneumonia, and was admitted to the Cosmopolitan hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, where he died at 3:40 p.m. (IST) on 19 March 1998, aged 88. This was barely hours after he had dictated two articles for &quot;Deshabhimani&quot;, a CPI (M) daily, and replies to a few letters.

The state government declared a seven-day mourning. His body was draped in the CPI (M) flag and was taken to AKG Centre in the city where members of his family paid their respects, before it was taken to Durbar Hall and was kept for viewing, where members of the public, and party leaders and workers paid their respects. Thousands of people joined the funeral procession and he was cremated with full state honours in Thycaud electric crematorium in Thiruvananthapuram.

The President of India K. R. Narayanan condoled his death and stated: &quot;A scholar, historian and journalist, he was above all an educator of the people as well as their leader. Unremittingly, for the last several decades, he analysed the socio-political scene from the firm-rootedness of his intellectual position and enriched Indian political thought to his very last days.&quot; Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who took office on the same day Namboodiripad died, recalled that Namboodiripad had brought to politics a sense of commitment and purpose and that he was a champion of the cause of the working classes and the downtrodden.

Three more deaths occurred in his family within five years after his death, starting with his daughter-in-law Dr. Yamuna in August 2001, and later followed by his wife Arya Antharjanam in January 2002 and elder son E.M. Sreedharan in November 2002. E.M. Sasi, his younger son, died on 24 January 2022 after suffering from a massive heart attack.

== Family ==
EMS was married to Arya Antharjanam and had two sons – E. M. Sreedharan and E. M. Sasi – and two daughters – E. M. Malathy and E. M. Radha. His grandson (Sreedharan&#x27;s son) Sujith Shankar is an actor.

== Writing ==
He was a writer and author of several literary works and his book on the history of Kerala is notable.

== In popular culture ==
In the 2014 film &quot;Vasanthathinte Kanal Vazhikalil&quot;, Sudheesh reprises the role of Namboodiripad.

<doc id="219630" wikidata="Q1366862" url="?curid=219630" title="Wim van Est">
<text>Willem &quot;Wim&quot; van Est (25 March 1923 – 1 May 2003) was a Dutch racing cyclist. He is best known for being the first Dutch cyclist to wear the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification in the Tour de France of 1951, and for falling into a ravine while wearing it.

==Biography==

Van Est was born in the town of Fijnaart, in North Brabant, the 2nd child in a family of 16 children. His family was pushed into poverty in the aftermath of World War One and growing up he lived on a makeshift farm. During this time one of his brothers died at a very young age and his father had to make a coffin for the child, and ride several miles on his bike while carrying the coffin with his son inside to the local church to give the child a proper burial.

During World War 2 the teenage Van Est began riding a considerable distance into Belgium smuggling tobacco and cheese which he would either sell or trade for soap, which he would return home with in order to sell on the Black Market. He was caught doing this during the war and had to serve six months in prison. After this, while the Nazi&#x27;s occupied his homeland, the teenage Van Est got the idea cycling for sport. When the war was over and races began again he saw a local race and thought he could beat everyone, but it would take him five years to reach the pro level.

He started his cycling career (as an amateur) in 1946, after a professional runner had seen him race in a local competition as part of a wager. His first major victory came in 1950, when he won the 600 km Bordeaux–Paris race.

In 1951, Van Est was part of the Dutch team for the Tour de France. This would be the first time in his entire life he had ever seen mountains of this caliber, let alone tried riding up or descending one. In the 12th stage, from Agen to Dax, he escaped with a small group. He won the stage and gained 19 minutes on the leader, enough to move up to first place in the general classification. As the first Dutchman to wear the accompanying yellow jersey he was praised by the public and media at home.

The next day, in defence of his position, Van Est was chasing the leaders on the descent of the Col d&#x27;Aubisque. He was following Fiorenzo Magni on the descent, a very strong rider who had already won two Giro&#x27;s as well as two Tour Stages, who had superior descending skill. Due to a flat tyre (according to Van Est himself), in conjunction with snow melt and many loose stones on the road he lost control of his bike and went over the cliff. He instinctively kicked his bike away as he fell and of the riders, officials and fans, Belgian rider Roger Decock was the only person to see him go over the ravine.

The ravine was approximately 1,000 feet or 300 meters deep, and much of it was steep enough that a falling person would continue falling all the way to the bottom. Van Est fell about 200 feet or 70 meters trying to grab at the saplings growing on the mountainside to break his fall. Fortunately he slowed and was able to grab hold of a small tree nearby a one meter wide outcrop, which he then made his way to. Even if he wanted to he could not climb back up or down, despite the fact he did not suffer any major injury.

As Van Est precariously sat overlooking a several hundred foot drop he began screaming for help. Fortunately Decock stopped when Van Est went over, giving up his 5th place in the overall standings dropping to 17th by the end of the Tour as a result of the 25 minutes he lost assisting the Dutchman. When the Dutch team car arrived and were told what happened they screamed down the mountain for him for several minutes hearing nothing but echoes. After a few minutes they were able to find his approximate location. It took the team quite some time to tie together every single tire tube they had in order to make a rope that they hoped would reach him. After a great deal of time their 75 meter &quot;rope&quot; reached Van Est and he was able to use the tires to rig together a hoist which he put around his chest under both arms.

Helped by spectators and his manager, he managed to get back to the road. Van Est wanted to continue, but was persuaded to go to the hospital because he had just crashed down a 200 foot ravine.

At home, Van Est&#x27;s fame grew even more when Belgian watchmaker , which had supplied watches to the Dutch team in the Tour de France, started an advertising campaign &quot;Seventy meters deep I dropped, my heart stood still but my Pontiac never stopped&quot;.

Later in his career, Van Est twice won the Ronde van Nederland, wore the yellow jersey again in 1955 and 1958, placed 8th in 1957 and won two more stages. Also, he won Bordeaux–Paris two more times, two national road titles, four national titles in the individual pursuit on the track, as well as three medals in the pursuit at the World Championships.

Nevertheless, he remained most famous for the two days in the 1951 Tour de France. To remember this event, a monument was placed on the mountain 50 years after the event, on 17 July 2001.

Wim van Est died in his hometown Sint Willebrord. His brothers Kees, Toon, Leen and Nico were also professional cyclists. His brother Piet was also a pro cyclist who rode in several Tours and won a stage in the 1961 Giro.

<doc id="219632" wikidata="Q294321" url="?curid=219632" title="James Brendan Connolly">
<text>James Brendan Bennet Connolly (, October 28, 1868 – January 20, 1957) was an American athlete and author. In 1896, he became the first modern Olympic champion.

== Early life ==
Connolly was born to poor Irish immigrants from the Aran Islands, fisherman John Connolly and Ann O&#x27;Donnell, as one of twelve children, in South Boston, Massachusetts. Growing up at a time when the parks and playground movement in Boston was slowly developing, Connolly joined other boys in the streets and vacant lots to run, jump, and play ball.

He was educated at Notre Dame Academy and then at the Mather and Lawrence grammar school, but never went to high school. Instead, Connolly worked as a clerk with an insurance company in Boston and later with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Savannah, Georgia.

His predisposition to sport also became apparent. Calling a special meeting of the Catholic Library Association (CLA) of Savannah in 1891, he was instrumental in forming a football team. Soon thereafter, Connolly was elected captain of the CLA Cycling Club and aggressively sought to promote the sport on behalf of the Savannah Wheelmen.

Altogether dissatisfied with his career path, Connolly sought to regain the lost years of high school through self-education. In October 1895, he sat for the entrance examination to the Lawrence Scientific School and was unconditionally accepted to study the classics at Harvard University.

== Olympic Games ==
After the creation of the International Olympic Committee in 1894 the first modern edition of the Olympic Games were scheduled for April 6 to 15, 1896 in Athens, Greece. Connolly decided to participate, and submitted a request for a leave of absence to the Chairman of the Harvard University Committee on the Regulation of Athletic Sports and was denied. According to Connolly himself, he was informed that his only course of action would be to resign and make a reapplication to the college. Connolly then claimed to have replied:

I am not resigning and I&#x27;m not making application to re-enter. I&#x27;m getting through with Harvard right now. Good day!

It is unclear whether this really happened. Harvard records do show a request by Connolly for a leave of absence to Europe, which was denied. Connolly then requested an honorable withdrawal as a student, which was granted on March 19, 1896.

Representing the Suffolk Athletic Club, which paid for most of Connolly&#x27;s expenses (Connolly later claimed he paid it all himself), he left for Greece on a German freighter, the &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, along with most of the rest of the first American Olympic team. After arriving in Naples, Italy he was robbed and almost lost his ticket to Athens. He managed to retrieve it only after a pursuit against the robber. Finally he took the train to Athens, arriving there just in time for the Games.

The first final on the opening day was the triple jump (then known as the &quot;hop, skip and jump&quot;), one of the events in which Connolly competed. Connolly&#x27;s style, taking two hops with the right foot, is no longer allowed in this event but was perfectly acceptable in 1896. With this style, he outjumped the field, finishing more than one meter ahead of his nearest opponent by jumping 11 3/4 in), earning him the first silver medal (gold medals did not yet exist). With this performance, he became the first Olympic champion since AD 385, when the Athenian Zopyrus won the pankration (other sources name the Armenian Varasdates, who won at boxing in 369).

He went on to take second place in the high jump () tying with Robert Garrett behind Ellery Clark, and third place in the long jump (). Back home in Boston, Connolly was welcomed enthusiastically, and was presented a gold watch by the citizens of South Boston.

Connolly competed at the 1906 Olympics in the Triple Jump and Long Jump.

Connolly would also visit the second edition of the modern Olympics, held in Paris. There, he failed to retain his title in the triple jump, losing to compatriot Meyer Prinstein.

In the 1984 NBC miniseries &quot;The First Olympics: Athens 1896&quot;, he was portrayed by David Caruso. Contrary to what is portrayed in the film, Connolly did not emigrate to America from Ireland.

Connollystraße, in Munich is named in his honour and was a key location in the events surrounding the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

== Writer ==
The 1904 Summer Olympics were also attended by Connolly, but as a journalist, not as an athlete. Earlier, he had already published his accounts of the Spanish–American War in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; as &quot;Letters from the Front in Cuba&quot;. He served there in the Irish 9th Infantry of Massachusetts.

Connolly became an authority on maritime writing, after spending years on many different vessels, fishing boats, military ships all over the world. In all, he published more than 200 short stories, and 25 novels. Furthermore, he twice ran for Congress of the United States on the ticket of the Progressive Party, but was never elected.

He never returned to Harvard, but received an honorary athletic sweater in 1948. A year later, he was offered an honorary doctorate by Harvard University, which he turned down. He was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Connolly died in New York City at the age of 88. A collection of items related to Connolly, including his triple jump silver medal, is housed in the library of Colby College in Maine.

==Schooner championship==
Connolly was a crew member of the victorious schooner &quot;Esperanto&quot; in 1920, during the first International Fishing Schooner Championship Races in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He wrote of this in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on December 25, 1920, and in &quot;The Book of the Gloucester Fishermen&quot;, published in 1927.

==Politics==
In 1912, Connolly was the Progressive nominee for Congress from South Boston and Dorchester. He was defeated by incumbent Congressman James Michael Curley.

When Curley resigned to become Mayor of Boston in 1914, Connolly ran again in the special election to replace him, but finished third behind James A. Gallivan and Republican Frank Brier. he died in 1957 at 88.

<doc id="219638" wikidata="Q4690451" url="?curid=219638" title="After 7">
<text>After 7 is an American R&amp;B group founded in 1987 by brothers Melvin and Kevon Edmonds, and their friend Keith Mitchell. The Edmonds brothers are the older siblings of pop/R&amp;B singer-songwriter and record producer Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, who named the group and helped them get a record deal with Virgin Records in 1988. After 7 released their platinum-selling self-titled debut album in 1989, which spawned three singles &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;, &quot;Ready or Not&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;. &quot;Ready or Not&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; were No. 1 R&amp;B hits and top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second album &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot;, released in 1992, also went platinum and contained the R&amp;B hit medley &quot;Baby, I&#x27;m for Real/Natural High&quot;. After 7&#x27;s Gold-selling 1995 album &quot;Reflections&quot; was their last album before the group disbanded in 1997. The album included the R&amp;B hit &quot;&#x27;Til You Do Me Right. Years later the group resumed touring with Jason Edmonds, son of Melvin Edmonds, replacing his father. Melvin rejoined the group for their successful 2016 comeback album Timeless, which featured 3 adult R&amp;B top 10 hits &quot;Runnin&#x27; Out&quot;, &quot;I Want You&quot; and &quot;Let Me Know&quot;.

Melvin Edmonds died on May 18, 2019, at the age of 65. Jason left the group shortly thereafter and Daniel McClain was added in 2019. Four years later, McClain departed and was replaced by Wil Robinson.

==History==
===Early beginnings and formation===
Marvin Edmonds Sr. and Barbara Edmonds of Indianapolis, Indiana had six sons: Marvin Jr., Melvin, Michael, Kevon, Kenneth and Derek. According to Babyface, Melvin and Kevon were the two best singers in the musical family. The roots of After 7 trace to when Kevon met Keith Mitchell at Indiana University Bloomington in the late 1970s, where they were members of the Indiana University Soul Revue. Kevon and Keith decided to form a group as a hobby and add Melvin. For years Kevon worked at Eli Lilly and Company, Mitchell worked at John Hancock in Chicago and Melvin worked at Chrysler Corp. in Indianapolis. They would occasionally come together to perform in Indianapolis. Mitchell was long thought to be the cousin of Babyface&#x27;s then-songwriting/production partner Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid; however, this was set up as a marketing tool for the group and was incorrect.

By the late 1980s, the Edmonds&#x27; younger brother Babyface had built a successful career singing, writing and producing. He invited Melvin, Kevon and Keith out to Los Angeles, named them After 7, and got them a record deal with Virgin Records.

===Career success===
After 7 released their self-titled debut album in August 1989. The album was mostly written and produced by Babyface and L.A. Reid. The album was certified platinum and produced three singles &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;, &quot;Ready or Not&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; and two other charting songs &quot;One Night&quot; and &quot;My Only Woman&quot;. &quot;Ready or Not&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; were both No. 1 R&amp;B hits and reached No. 7 and No. 6 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of best R&amp;B performance by a duo or group. After 7 toured with MC Hammer in the summer of 1990, and they won an NAACP Image Award for best new male artist or group that year. In 1991, they released the top 10 R&amp;B hit &quot;Nights Like This&quot; for &quot;The Five Heartbeats&quot; movie soundtrack. That same year, they took the road as Whitney Houston&#x27;s opening act on her &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight World Tour&quot;.

After 7&#x27;s second album &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; was released in August 1992. The album is notable for being their only album without any songs produced by Babyface and L.A. Reid, who were focused on developing other artists. Instead, they contribute as writers, with Reid co-writing the songs &quot;Can He Love U Like This&quot; and &quot;G.S.T.&quot;, and Babyface writing &quot;Truly Something Special&quot; and &quot;Love by Day/Love by Night&quot;. The production was handed over to Daryl Simmons &amp; Kayo, who co-produced and co-wrote many of the songs on their debut album.

Other songs on the album were produced by Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis associate Randy Ran and producer Dallas Austin. As a result, this gave &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; a decidedly &quot;new jack swing&quot; sound and feel. Three singles were released from the album; the first was &quot;Kickin&#x27; It&quot;, followed by a medley of The Originals&#x27; song &quot;Baby I&#x27;m for Real&quot; and Bloodstone&#x27;s &quot;Natural High&quot;. The third single was &quot;Can He Love U Like This&quot;. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA.

&quot;Reflections&quot; is the third and last studio album by After 7 before the group split. The album reunited them with producer Babyface and L.A. Reid. They also enlisted the production talents of Babyface protegés Jon B. and Keith Andes as well as newcomers The Boom Brothers. Reflections is the first After 7 album on which the members of the group are credited as both songwriters and executive producers. The album included the R&amp;B top 5 hit &quot;&#x27;Til You Do Me Right. Melvin exited the group after the release of &quot;Reflections&quot; and the group officially disbanded in 1997. After 7&#x27;s last release on Virgin Records was the compilation album &quot;The Very Best of After 7&quot; in March 1997. It included unreleased material, including a cover version of &quot;Sara Smile&quot;. Also in 1997, Melvin and Kevon joined their brother Babyface to form the quintet Milestone along with K-Ci &amp; JoJo. The group only released one single, &quot;I Care &#x27;Bout You&quot;, for the &quot;Soul Food&quot; movie soundtrack.

===Comeback=== 
Kevon Edmonds released the solo album 24/7 in October 1999. He invited his nephew Jason Edmonds, son of Melvin, to tour with him as a background singer for years. By the late 2000s, After 7 resumed touring with Jason replacing his father. However, the group decided not to record again without the participation of Melvin. Melvin battled health issues, including a stroke in 2011. Melvin was able to reunite with the group on the 2015 single &quot;I Want You&quot;, which reached the top 10 of Billboard&#x27;s adult R&amp;B songs chart. The group also recorded a version of the song with Babyface. The album &quot;Timeless&quot; was released in October 2016. It featured the group as a quartet (Melvin, Kevon, Keith and Jason) and included &quot;I Want You&quot; and other top 10 adult R&amp;B hits &quot;Runnin&#x27; Out&quot; and &quot;Let Me Know&quot;.

Melvin Edmonds died on May 18, 2019, at the age of 65. Jason left the group shortly thereafter and Daniel McClain was added. After 7 released their fifth album &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; in August 2021. Danny was then replaced in 2023 by Wil Robinson and they continue to perform to the present day.

<text>Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture concerned with animals that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, or other products. It includes day-to-day care, management, production, nutrition, selective breeding, and the raising of livestock. Husbandry has a long history, starting with the Neolithic Revolution when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000 BC onwards, predating farming of the first crops. During the period of ancient societies like ancient Egypt, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs were being raised on farms.

Major changes took place in the Columbian exchange, when Old World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the Dishley Longhorn cattle and Lincoln Longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists, such as Robert Bakewell, to yield more meat, milk, and wool. A wide range of other species, such as horse, water buffalo, llama, rabbit, and guinea pig, are used as livestock in some parts of the world. Insect farming, as well as aquaculture of fish, molluscs, and crustaceans, is widespread. Modern animal husbandry relies on production systems adapted to the type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where, for example, beef cattle are kept in high-density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil, such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Animal agriculture at modern scale drives climate change, ocean acidification, and biodiversity loss. 

Most livestock are herbivores, except (among the most commonly-kept species) for pigs and chickens which are omnivores. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage and require other high-protein foods.

==Etymology==
The verb &quot;to husband&quot;, meaning &quot;to manage carefully&quot;, derives from an older meaning of &quot;husband&quot;, which in the 14th century referred to the ownership and care of a household or farm, but today means the &quot;control or judicious use of resources&quot;, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants or animals. Farmers and ranchers who raise livestock are considered to practice &quot;animal husbandry&quot;.

==History==
===Birth of husbandry===

The domestication of livestock was driven by the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to the domesticator, should be able to thrive in his or her company, should breed freely, and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities. The first wild animal to be domesticated was the dog. Half-wild dogs, perhaps starting with young individuals, may have been tolerated as scavengers and killers of vermin, and being naturally pack hunters, were predisposed to become part of the human pack and join in the hunt. Prey animals, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle, were progressively domesticated early in the history of agriculture. Pigs were domesticated in the Near East between 8,500 and 8000 BC, sheep and goats in or near the Fertile Crescent about 8,500 BC, and cattle from wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. A cow was a great advantage to a villager as she produced more milk than her calf needed, and her strength could be put to use as a working animal, pulling a plough to increase production of crops, and drawing a sledge, and later a cart, to bring the produce home from the field. Draught animals were first used about 4,000 BC in the Middle East, increasing agricultural production immeasurably. 

In southern Asia, the elephant was domesticated by 6,000 BC. Fossilised chicken bones dated to 5040 BC have been found in northeastern China, far from where their wild ancestors lived in the jungles of tropical Asia, but archaeologists believe that the original purpose of domestication was for the sport of cockfighting. Meanwhile, in South America, the llama and the alpaca had been domesticated, probably before 3,000 BC, as beasts of burden and for their wool. Neither was strong enough to pull a plough which limited the development of agriculture in the New World. Horses occur naturally on the steppes of Central Asia and their domestication began around 3,000 BC in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea region. Although horses were originally seen as a source of meat, their use as pack animals and for riding followed. Around the same time, the wild ass was being tamed in Egypt. Camels were domesticated soon after this, with the Bactrian camel in Mongolia and the Arabian camel becoming beasts of burden. By 1000 BC, caravans of Arabian camels were linking India with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.

===Ancient civilisations===
In ancient Egypt, cattle were the most important livestock, and sheep, goats, and pigs were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Honey bees were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax. In ancient Rome, all the livestock known in ancient Egypt were available. In addition, rabbits were domesticated for food by the first century BC. To help flush them out from their burrows, the polecat was domesticated as the ferret, its use described by Pliny the Elder.

===Medieval husbandry===
In northern Europe, agriculture including animal husbandry went into decline when the Roman empire collapsed. Some aspects such as the herding of animals continued throughout the period. By the 11th century, the economy had recovered and the countryside was again productive. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; recorded every parcel of land and every animal in England: &quot;there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover ... not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in [the king&#x27;s] writ.&quot; For example, the royal manor of Earley in Berkshire, one of thousands of villages recorded in the book, had in 1086 &quot;2 fisheries worth [paying tax of] 7s and 6d [each year] and 20 acres of meadow [for livestock]. Woodland for [feeding] 70 pigs.&quot; The improvements of animal husbandry in the medieval period in Europe went hand in hand with other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.

===Columbian exchange===
Exploration and colonisation of North and South America resulted in the introduction into Europe of such crops as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc, while the principal Old World livestock – cattle, horses, sheep and goats – were introduced into the New World for the first time along with wheat, barley, rice and turnips.

===Agricultural Revolution===

Selective breeding for desired traits was established as a scientific practice by Robert Bakewell during the British Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century. One of his most important breeding programs was with sheep. Using native stock, he was able to quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was hornless and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines. These sheep were exported widely and have contributed to numerous modern breeds. Under his influence, English farmers began to breed cattle for use primarily as beef. Long-horned heifers were crossed with the Westmoreland bull to create the Dishley Longhorn.

The semi-natural, unfertilised pastures formed by traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. As the ecological impact of this land management strategy is similar to the impact of such natural disturbances as grazing and wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of biodiversity. This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.

==Practices==
=== Systems ===

Traditionally, animal husbandry was part of the subsistence farmer&#x27;s way of life, producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal was still alive. In the traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture was up in the mountains, the winter pasture in the valleys.

Animals can be kept extensively or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, or under the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca.

In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.

At the other extreme, in the more developed parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family-run farms where livestock graze outside for much of the year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed, and other inputs are brought onto the farm from outside.

===Feeding===

Animals used as livestock are predominantly herbivorous, the main exceptions being the pig and the chicken which are omnivorous. The herbivores can be divided into &quot;concentrate selectors&quot; which selectively feed on seeds, fruits and highly nutritious young foliage, &quot;grazers&quot; which mainly feed on grass, and &quot;intermediate feeders&quot; which choose their diet from the whole range of available plant material. Cattle, sheep, goats, deer and antelopes are ruminants; they digest food in two steps, chewing and swallowing in the normal way, and then regurgitating the semidigested cud to chew it again and thus extract the maximum possible food value.
The dietary needs of these animals is mostly met by eating grass. Grasses grow from the base of the leaf-blade, enabling it to thrive even when heavily grazed or cut.

In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass). Other forage crops are also grown and many of these, as well as crop residues, can be ensiled to fill the gap in the nutritional needs of livestock in the lean season.

Extensively reared animals may subsist entirely on forage, but more intensively kept livestock will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, fats and oils and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction.
Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals&#x27; rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, in the form of pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.

=== Breeding===
The breeding of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers with a view to encouraging traits seen as desirable. These include hardiness, fertility, docility, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, and better fibre qualities. Undesirable traits such as health defects and aggressiveness are selected against.

Selective breeding has been responsible for large increases in productivity. For example, in 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957, while in the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.

===Animal health===

Good husbandry, proper feeding, and hygiene are the main contributors to animal health on the farm, bringing economic benefits through maximised production. When, despite these precautions, animals still become sick, they are treated with veterinary medicines, by the farmer and the veterinarian. In the European Union, when farmers treat their own animals, they are required to follow the guidelines for treatment and to record the treatments given. Animals are susceptible to a number of diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Animals living under intensive conditions are prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.

Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antimicrobial resistance in livestock and in humans.

Governments are concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases that can affect domestic animals which may acquire them as a result of insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.

===Range of species===
There is no single universally agreed definition of which species are livestock. Widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and dairy, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. Various other species are sometimes considered livestock, such as horses, while poultry birds are sometimes excluded. In some parts of the world, livestock includes species such as buffalo, and the South American camelids, the alpaca and llama. Some authorities use much broader definitions to include fish in aquaculture, micro-livestock such as rabbits and rodents like guinea pigs, as well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption.

==Products==
Animals are raised for a wide variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and eggs, but also including tallow, isinglass and rennet. Animals are also kept for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and antiserum (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or other crops are grown alongside animals, manure can serve as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.

==Branches==
===Dairy===

Although all mammals produce milk to nourish their young, the cow is predominantly used throughout the world to produce milk and milk products for human consumption. Other animals used to a lesser extent for this purpose include sheep, goats, camels, buffaloes, yaks, reindeer, horses and donkeys.

All these animals have been domesticated over the centuries, being bred for such desirable characteristics as fecundity, productivity, docility and the ability to thrive under the prevailing conditions. Whereas in the past cattle had multiple functions, modern dairy cow breeding has resulted in specialised Holstein Friesian-type animals that produce large quantities of milk economically. Artificial insemination is widely available to allow farmers to select for the particular traits that suit their circumstances.

Whereas in the past cows were kept in small herds on family farms, grazing pastures and being fed hay in winter, nowadays there is a trend towards larger herds, more intensive systems, the feeding of silage and &quot;zero grazing&quot;, a system where grass is cut and brought to the cow, which is housed year-round.

In many communities, milk production is only part of the purpose of keeping an animal which may also be used as a beast of burden or to draw a plough, or for the production of fibre, meat and leather, with the dung being used for fuel or for the improvement of soil fertility. Sheep and goats may be favoured for dairy production in climates and conditions that do not suit dairy cows.

===Meat===

Meat, mainly from farmed animals, is a major source of dietary protein and essential nutrients around the world, averaging about 8% of man&#x27;s energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more than a year to mature; sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one litter of up to about 11 piglets each year. Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food conversion efficiency. About half of the world&#x27;s meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.

===Poultry===

Poultry, kept for their eggs and for their meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great majority of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.

In the developed world, the majority of the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this way are known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor absorbs the droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one time.

A similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys, which are less hardy than chickens, but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate fattening units to finish. Ducks are particularly popular in Asia and Australia and can be killed at seven weeks under commercial conditions.

===Aquaculture===

Aquaculture has been defined as &quot;the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants and implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated.&quot; In practice it can take place in the sea or in freshwater, and be extensive or intensive. Whole bays, lakes or ponds may be devoted to aquaculture, or the farmed animal may be retained in cages (fish), artificial reefs, racks or strings (shellfish). Fish and prawns can be cultivated in rice paddies, either arriving naturally or being introduced, and both crops can be harvested together.

Fish hatcheries provide larval and juvenile fish, crustaceans and shellfish, for use in aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities can be used to raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this while at the same time maximising growth rates.

===Insects===

Bees have been kept in hives since at least the First Dynasty of Egypt, five thousand years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used in many parts of the world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.

Sericulture, the rearing of silkworms, was first adopted by the Chinese during the Shang dynasty. The only species farmed commercially is the domesticated silkmoth. When it spins its cocoon, each larva produces an exceedingly long, slender thread of silk. The larvae feed on mulberry leaves and in Europe, only one generation is normally raised each year as this is a deciduous tree. In China, Korea and Japan however, two generations are normal, and in the tropics, multiple generations are expected. Most production of silk occurs in the Far East, with a synthetic diet being used to rear the silkworms in Japan.

Insects form part of the human diet in many cultures. In Thailand, crickets are farmed for this purpose in the north of the country, and palm weevil larvae in the south. The crickets are kept in pens, boxes or drawers and fed on commercial pelleted poultry food, while the palm weevil larvae live on cabbage palm and sago palm trees, which limits their production to areas where these trees grow. Another delicacy of this region is the bamboo caterpillar, and the best rearing and harvesting techniques in semi-natural habitats are being studied.

==Effects==
=== Environmental impact ===

Animal husbandry has a significant impact on the world environment. Both production and consumption of animal products have increased rapidly. Since 1950, meat production has tripled, whereas the production of dairy products doubled and that of eggs almost increased fourfold. Meanwhile, meat consumption has nearly doubled worldwide. Developing countries had a surge in meat consumption, particularly of monogastric livestock. Animal husbandry drives climate change, ocean acidification, and biodiversity loss, and kills 60 billion animals annually. It uses between 20 and 33% of the world&#x27;s fresh water, Livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the Earth&#x27;s ice-free land. Livestock production contributes to species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. and is the primary driver of the Holocene extinction. Some 70% of the agricultural land and 30% of Earth&#x27;s land surface is involved directly or indirectly in animal husbandry. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, animal husbandry causes up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day, that accounts for 35 to 40% of the overall methane emissions of the planet. Further, livestock production is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide.
===Animal welfare===

Since the 18th century, people have become increasingly concerned about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly in line with the most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, are not necessary to use, and should never be used by humans. Live export of animals has risen to meet increased global demand for livestock such as in the Middle East. Animal rights activists have objected to long-distance transport of animals; one result was the banning of live exports from New Zealand in 2003.
== In culture ==
Since the 18th century, the farmer John Bull has represented English national identity, first in John Arbuthnot&#x27;s political satires, and soon afterwards in cartoons by James Gillray and others including John Tenniel. He likes food, beer, dogs, horses, and country sports; he is practical and down to earth, and anti-intellectual.

Farm animals are widespread in books and songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, a picture completely at odds with the realities of the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.

Pigs, for example, appear in several of Beatrix Potter&#x27;s &quot;little books&quot;, as Piglet in A.A. Milne&#x27;s Winnie the Pooh stories, and somewhat more darkly (with a hint of animals going to slaughter) as Babe in Dick King-Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Sheep-Pig&quot;, and as Wilbur in E. B. White&#x27;s &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;. Pigs tend to be &quot;bearers of cheerfulness, good humour and innocence&quot;. Many of these books are completely anthropomorphic, dressing farm animals in clothes and having them walk on two legs, live in houses, and perform human activities. The children&#x27;s song &quot;Old MacDonald Had a Farm&quot; describes a farmer named MacDonald and the various animals he keeps, celebrating the noises they each make.

Many urban children experience animal husbandry for the first time at a petting farm; in Britain, some five million people a year visit a farm of some kind. This presents some risk of infection, especially if children handle animals and then fail to wash their hands; a strain of &quot;E. coli&quot; infected 93 people who had visited a British interactive farm in an outbreak in 2009. Historic farms such as those in the United States offer farmstays and &quot;a carefully curated version of farming to those willing to pay for it&quot;, sometimes giving visitors a romanticised image of a pastoral idyll from an unspecified time in the pre-industrial past.

<doc id="219642" wikidata="Q740920" url="?curid=219642" title="Porgy and Bess">
<text>Porgy and Bess () is an English-language opera by American composer George Gershwin, with a libretto written by author DuBose Heyward and lyricist Ira Gershwin. It was adapted from Dorothy Heyward and DuBose Heyward&#x27;s play &quot;Porgy&quot;, itself an adaptation of DuBose Heyward&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;Porgy&quot;.

&quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was first performed in Boston on September 30, 1935, before it moved to Broadway in New York City. It featured a cast of classically trained African-American singers—a daring artistic choice at the time. A 1976 Houston Grand Opera production gained it a renewed popularity, and it is now one of the best known and most frequently performed operas.

The libretto of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; tells the story of Porgy, a disabled black street beggar living in the slums of Charleston. It deals with his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown, her violent and possessive lover, and Sportin&#x27; Life, her drug dealer. The opera plot generally follows the stage play.

In the years following Gershwin&#x27;s death, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was adapted for smaller-scale performances. It was adapted as a film in 1959. Some of the songs in the opera, such as &quot;Summertime&quot;, became popular and are frequently recorded. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been toward productions with greater fidelity to Gershwin&#x27;s original intentions, though smaller-scale productions also continue to be mounted. A complete recorded version of the score was released in 1976; since then, it has been recorded several times.

==Inception==
The origin of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; is DuBose Heyward&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;Porgy&quot;. Heyward produced a play by the same name with Dorothy Heyward.

George Gershwin read &quot;Porgy&quot; in 1926 and proposed to Heyward to collaborate on an operatic version. In 1934, Gershwin and Heyward began work on the project by visiting the author&#x27;s native Charleston, South Carolina. In a 1935 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Gershwin explained his motivation for calling &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; a folk opera:
&quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; is a folk tale. Its people naturally would sing folk music. When I first began work on the music I decided against the use of original folk material because I wanted the music to be all of one piece. Therefore I wrote my own spirituals and folksongs. But they are still folk music—and therefore, being in operatic form, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; becomes a folk opera.

== Composition history ==

In the fall of 1933 Gershwin and Heyward signed a contract with the Theatre Guild to write the opera. In the summer of 1934 Gershwin and Heyward went to Folly Beach, South Carolina (a small island near Charleston), where Gershwin got a feel for the locale and its music. He worked on the opera there and in New York. Ira Gershwin, in New York, wrote lyrics to some of the opera&#x27;s classic songs, most notably &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot;. Most of the lyrics, including &quot;Summertime&quot;, were written by Heyward, who also wrote the libretto.

== Performance history ==
=== 1935 original Broadway production ===
Gershwin&#x27;s first version of the opera, running four hours (counting the two intermissions), was performed privately in a concert version in Carnegie Hall, in the fall of 1935. He chose as his choral director Eva Jessye, who also directed her own renowned choir. The world premiere performance took place at the Colonial Theatre in Boston on September 30, 1935—the try-out for a work intended initially for Broadway where the opening took place at the Alvin Theatre in New York City on October 10, 1935. During rehearsals and in Boston, Gershwin made many cuts and refinements to shorten the running time and tighten the dramatic action. The run on Broadway lasted 124 performances. The production and direction were entrusted to Rouben Mamoulian, who had previously directed the Broadway productions of Heyward&#x27;s play &quot;Porgy&quot;. The music director was Alexander Smallens.

The leading roles were played by Todd Duncan and Anne Brown. Brown was a 20-year-old student at Juilliard, the first African-American vocalist admitted there, when she read that George Gershwin was going to write a musical version of &quot;Porgy&quot;. She wrote him and asked to sing for him, and Gershwin&#x27;s secretary invited her. Gershwin was impressed and began asking Brown to come and sing the songs as he composed them for &quot;Porgy&quot;. The character of Bess was originally a secondary character, but as Gershwin was impressed with Brown&#x27;s singing, he expanded the part of Bess and cast Brown. When they had completed rehearsals and were ready to begin previews, Gershwin invited Brown to join him for lunch. At that meeting, he told her, &quot;I want you to know, Miss Brown, that henceforth and forever after, George Gershwin&#x27;s opera will be known as &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.&quot; Influential vaudeville artist John W. Bubbles created the role of Sportin&#x27; Life; the role of Serena was created by Ruby Elzy.

After the Broadway run, a tour started on January 27, 1936, in Philadelphia and traveled to Pittsburgh and Chicago before ending in Washington, DC, on March 21, 1936. During the Washington run, the cast—as led by Todd Duncan—protested segregation at the National Theatre. Eventually management gave in to the demands, resulting in the first integrated audience for a performance of any show at that venue.

In 1938, many of the original cast reunited for a West Coast revival that played in Los Angeles and at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco. Avon Long took on the role of Sportin&#x27; Life for the first time, a role he continued to play in many productions over a long career.

=== 1942 Broadway revival ===
Noted director and producer Cheryl Crawford produced professional stock theater in Maplewood, New Jersey, for three very successful seasons. The last of these closed with &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, which she co-produced with John Wildberg. In refashioning it in the style of musical theater which Americans were used to hearing from Gershwin, Crawford produced a drastically cut version of the opera compared with the first Broadway staging. The orchestra was reduced, the cast was halved, and many recitatives were reduced to spoken dialog.

Having seen the performance, theater owner Lee Shubert arranged for Crawford to bring her production to Broadway. The show opened at the Majestic Theatre in January 1942. Duncan and Brown reprised their roles as the title characters, with Alexander Smallens again conducting. In June, contralto Etta Moten, whom Gershwin had first envisioned as Bess, replaced Brown in the role. Moten was such a success that Bess became her signature role. The Crawford production ran for nine months and was far more successful financially than the original.

Radio station WOR in New York broadcast a live one-hour version on May 7, 1942. The cast included Todd Duncan, Anne Brown, Ruby Elzy, Eloise C. Uggams, Avon Long, Edward Matthews, Harriet Jackson, Georgette Harvey, Jack Carr, and the Eva Jessye Choir; the WOR Symphony was conducted by Alfred Wallenstein. The 12-inch-diameter 78 rpm, glass base, lacquer-coated disks were transferred to open-reel tape on February 6, 1975.

=== European premieres ===
On March 27, 1943, the opera had its European premiere at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen. Performed during the Nazi occupation of the country, this performance was notable for being performed by an all-white cast made up in blackface. After 22 sold-out performances, the Nazis forced the theater to close the production. Other all- or mostly white productions in Europe, reflecting contemporary demographics in the countries, took place in Zürich, Switzerland, in 1945 and 1950, and Gothenburg and Stockholm, Sweden, in 1948.
=== 1952 touring production ===
Blevins Davis and Robert Breen produced a revival in 1952 which restored much of the music cut in the Crawford version, including many of the recitatives. It divided the opera into two acts, with the intermission occurring after Crown forces Bess to stay on Kittiwah Island. This version restored the work to a more operatic form, though not all of the recitatives were retained. In this version, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was warmly received throughout Europe. The London premiere took place on October 9, 1952, at the Stoll Theatre where the opera continued until February 10, 1953.

This production&#x27;s original cast featured Americans Leontyne Price as Bess, William Warfield as Porgy, and Cab Calloway as Sportin&#x27; Life, a role that Gershwin had composed with him in mind. The role of Ruby was played by a young Maya Angelou. Price and Warfield met and wed while on the tour. The role of Porgy was the first for Warfield after his appearance as Joe singing &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; in the popular 1951 MGM film of &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

After a tour of Europe financed by the United States Department of State, the production came to Broadway&#x27;s Ziegfeld Theatre in March 1953. It later toured North America. After completing its North American run in Montreal, the company embarked on an international tour, with LeVern Hutcherson as Porgy and Gloria Davy as Bess. The production first performed in Venice, Paris, and London, and in other cities in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The company also made a stop at the Cairo Opera House in Egypt in January 1955. In 1955–1956 the company toured in cities in the Middle East, Africa, Russia, and Latin America.

During this tour, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was presented for the first time at La Scala in Milan in February 1955. A historic yet tense premiere took place in Leningrad in December 1955; it was during the Cold War and the first time an American theater group had been to the Soviet capital since the Bolshevik Revolution. Author Truman Capote traveled with the cast and crew, and wrote an account included in his book &quot;The Muses Are Heard&quot;.

=== 1965 New Zealand Opera production ===
This 1965 production by New Zealand Opera included several Māori opera singers, deemed by the Gershwin trust to be consistent with the requirement for black artists as the cast. The experience of working with a Broadway musical director, Ella Gerber, and being in the cast (from chorus to a minor character role) was a unique opportunity for New Zealand opera singers.

===1965 Volksoper Vienna production===
As opposed to the American productions from 1942 up until 1976, the 1965 Volksoper production was performed as an opera as George Gershwin conceived it and was based on the original 1935-Broadway production, i.e., restoring the sung recitatives as well as opening cuts similar to 1935. The conductor and stage director were Americans, and the lead roles as well as most small parts were sung by Black-Americans. Only the chorus was the Volksoper&#x27;s own white chorus. The Volksoper orchestra used the original instrumentation, though its string section was larger than the original Broadway. The production was revived several times up into the first half of the 1970&#x27;s

=== 1976 Houston Grand Opera production ===
During the 1960s and early 1970s, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; mostly languished on the shelves, a victim of its perceived racism. Though new productions took place in 1961 and 1964, along with a Vienna Volksoper premiere in 1965 (again with William Warfield as Porgy), these did little to change many African Americans&#x27; opinions of the work. Many music critics still had not accepted it as a true opera.

A new staging of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was produced by the Houston Grand Opera in 1976, directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien with musical direction by John DeMain; it restored the complete original score for the first time. Following its debut in Houston, the production opened on Broadway at the Uris Theatre on September 25, 1976, and was recorded complete by RCA Records. This version was very influential in turning the tide of opinion about the work.

For the first time, an American opera company, not a Broadway production company, had tackled the opera. This production was based on Gershwin&#x27;s original full score. It did not incorporate the cuts and other changes that Gershwin had made before the New York premiere, nor the ones made for the 1942 Cheryl Crawford revival or the 1959 film version. It allowed the public to take in the operatic whole as first envisioned by the composer. In this light, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was accepted as an opera. Donnie Ray Albert and Robert Mosley alternated performances in the role of Porgy. Clamma Dale and Larry Marshall starred, respectively, as Bess and Sportin&#x27; Life. This production won the Houston Grand Opera a Tony Award—the only opera ever to receive one—and a 1978 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. The conductor was John DeMain.

===Subsequent productions===
Another Broadway production was staged in 1983 at Radio City Music Hall with conductor C. William Harwood, based on the Houston production.

The Metropolitan Opera presented a production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; in 1985 after considering it since the 1930s. It opened February 6, 1985, with a cast including Simon Estes, Grace Bumbry, Bruce Hubbard, Gregg Baker and Florence Quivar. The Met production was directed by Nathaniel Merrill and designed by Robert O&#x27;Hearn. The conductor was James Levine. The production received 16 performances in its first season and was revived in 1986, 1989 and 1990, for a total of 54 performances.

Trevor Nunn first tackled the work in an acclaimed 1986 production at England&#x27;s Glyndebourne Festival. The 1986 Trevor Nunn production was scenically expanded and videotaped for television in 1993 (see below in &quot;Television&quot;). These productions were also based on the &quot;complete score,&quot; without incorporating Gershwin&#x27;s revisions. A semi-staged version of this production was performed at the Proms in 1998.

In 1995, the Houston Grand Opera launched a new tour of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; that travelled to ten cities with co-producing opera companies: Cleveland, Dallas, Irvine, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle; and Japan in 1996. The two-million dollar production included cast members Marquita Lister, Alvy Powell, Terry Cook, Larry Marshall, and Stacey Robinson; musical conductor John DeMain; and director and choreographer Hope Clarke, who became the first African American to direct a professional U.S. staging of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

The centennial celebration of the Gershwin brothers from 1996 to 1998 included a new production as well. On February 24–25, 2006, the Nashville Symphony, under the direction of John Mauceri, gave a concert performance at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. It incorporated Gershwin&#x27;s cuts made for the New York premiere, thus giving the audience an idea of what the opera sounded like on its Broadway opening. In 2000 and 2002 the New York City Opera had a revival directed by Tazewell Thompson. In 2007, Los Angeles Opera staged a revival directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted by John DeMain, who led the history-making Houston Opera revival of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; in 1976.

South Africa&#x27;s Cape Town Opera has frequently performed &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; abroad, most notably with the Welsh National Opera, NorrlandsOperan, Deutsche Oper Berlin and at the Wales Millennium Centre, Royal Festival Hall and Edinburgh Festival Theatre. In October 2010, its planned tour of the opera to Israel was criticized by Desmond Tutu.

=== 2006 &quot;The Gershwins&#x27; Porgy and Bess&quot; (Nunn adaptation) ===
&quot;The Gershwins&#x27; Porgy and Bess&quot; premiered on November 9, 2006, at the Savoy Theatre (London), directed by Trevor Nunn. (Although that was the title given to this production, the 1993 television adaptation of Nunn&#x27;s 1986 production had also used it.) For this new production, he adapted the lengthy opera to fit the conventions of musical theater. Working with the Gershwin and Heyward estates, Nunn used dialogue from the original novel and subsequent Broadway stage play to replace the recitatives with naturalistic scenes. He did not use operatic voices in this production, but relied on musical theater actors as leads. Gareth Valentine provided the musical adaptation. Despite mostly positive reviews, Nunn&#x27;s production closed months early because of poor box office returns.

This original cast of this version included Clarke Peters as Porgy, Nicola Hughes as Bess, O. T. Fagbenle as Sportin&#x27; Life, and Cornell S. John as Crown.

=== 2011 &quot;The Gershwins&#x27; Porgy and Bess&quot; (Paulus adaptation) ===
Another production titled &quot;The Gershwins&#x27; Porgy and Bess&quot;, directed by Diane Paulus with book adapted by Suzan-Lori Parks and music adapted by Diedre Murray, was presented by the American Repertory Theater (ART) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Broadway production was produced by Buddy Freitag and Barbara Freitag. Previews started August 17, and the show opened August 31, 2011. Following Trevor Nunn&#x27;s latest production of the work, the ART &quot;Porgy&quot; was the second production initiated by the Gershwin and Heyward estates to adapt the opera for the musical theater stage. Again spoken dialogue, here written by Parks, replaced the opera&#x27;s sung recitatives. William David Brohn and Christopher Jahnke created new orchestrations for the production.

Before the opening, Paulus, Parks and Murray made statements to the press about the production&#x27;s primary goal being to &quot;introduce the work to the next generation of theatergoers&quot;. They discussed changes to the opera&#x27;s plot, dialogue and score that were being explored to make the work more appealing to a contemporary audience. In response, esteemed Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim wrote a blistering letter to the &quot;New York Times&quot; criticizing Paulus, McDonald and Parks&#x27; &quot;disdain... toward the opera itself&quot; and criticized the new title &#x27;&quot;as just dumb&quot; because it underplayed the contribution of Heyward. The complete text of Sondheim&#x27;s letter may be seen at this link. Critic Hilton Als countered in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that Sondheim had very little exposure to black culture and that the Paulus version succeeded in &quot;humanizing the depiction of race onstage.&quot;

The production began previews on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in December 2011 and officially opened on January 12, 2012. The original cast included Audra McDonald as Bess, Norm Lewis as Porgy, David Alan Grier as Sportin&#x27; Life, Phillip Boykin as Crown, Nikki Renee Daniels as Clara, and Joshua Henry as Jake. All of the major roles are played by the same cast as in Cambridge.

Early reviews of the show were positive to mixed. All praised McDonald&#x27;s performance of Bess, but critics were divided on the success of the adaptation, staging and setting. Some praised the intimate scale of the drama and the believability of the performances; others found the staging to be unfocused and the settings to lack atmosphere. &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked the show as its number two choice among theater productions in 2011.

The production was nominated for 10 awards in the 2012 Tony Awards, winning Best Revival of a Musical and Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical for McDonald. The production ran through September 23, 2012. It played 322 performances, 17 more than the 1953 revival, making it the longest-running production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; on Broadway thus far.

=== 2014 &quot;The Gershwins&#x27; Porgy and Bess&quot; (London production) ===
This production ran at the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre from July 17 to August 23. Cast members included Rufus Bonds Jr (Porgy), Nicola Hughes (Bess), Cedric Neal (Sportin&#x27; Life), Phillip Boykin (Crown), Sharon D. Clarke (Mariah), Jade Ewen (Clara) and Golda Rosheuvel (Serena). The production was directed by Timothy Sheader, and also used the book adapted by Suzan-Lori Parks, It was nominated at the Olivier Awards for Best Musical Revival.

=== 2019 Metropolitan Opera production ===
After an absence of nearly thirty years on the Met stage, the company staged the new 2018 London production conducted by David Robertson in Fall 2019. It featured a cast including Golda Schultz, Latonia Moore, Angel Blue, Elizabeth Llewellyn, Denyce Graves, Eric Owens, Frederick Ballentine, Alfred Walker, and Ryan Speedo Green.

The production was hailed as &quot;splendid&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A live cast album, released on December 17, 2019, won a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.

== Roles ==

With the exception of a few speaking roles, all of the characters are black.

== Synopsis ==
:Place: Catfish Row, a fictitious large black tenement based on Cabbage Row, on the waterfront of Charleston, South Carolina.
:Time: The early 1920s.

=== Act 1 ===
&quot;Scene 1: Catfish Row, a summer evening&quot;

The opera begins with a short introduction which segues into an evening in Catfish Row. Jasbo Brown entertains the community with his piano playing. Clara, a young mother, sings a lullaby to her baby (&quot;Summertime&quot;) as the working men prepare for a game of craps (&quot;Roll them Bones&quot;). One of the players, Robbins, scorns his wife Serena&#x27;s demands that he not play, retorting that on a Saturday night, a man has the right to play. Clara&#x27;s husband, the fisherman Jake, tries his own lullaby (&quot;A Woman is a Sometime Thing&quot;) with little effect. Little by little, other characters in the opera enter Catfish Row, among them Mingo, another fisherman, and Jim, a cotton-hauling stevedore who, tired of his job, decides to give it up and join Jake and the other fishermen. Porgy, a disabled beggar, enters on his goat cart to organize the game. Peter, an elderly &quot;honey man&quot; [honey vendor] returns, singing his vendor&#x27;s call. Crown, a strong and brutal stevedore, storms in with his woman, Bess, and buys cheap whiskey and some &quot;happy dust&quot; off the local dope peddler, Sportin&#x27; Life. Bess is shunned by the women of the community, especially the pious Serena and the matriarchal cookshop owner Maria, but Porgy softly defends her. The game begins. One by one, the players get crapped out, leaving only Robbins and Crown, who has become extremely drunk. When Robbins wins, Crown attempts to prevent him from taking his winnings. A brawl ensues, which ends when Crown stabs Robbins with Jim&#x27;s cotton hook, killing him. Crown runs, telling Bess to fend for herself but that he will be back for her when the heat dies down. Sportin&#x27; Life gives her a dose of happy dust and offers to take her with him when he goes to New York, but she rejects him. He flees, and Bess begins to pound on doors, but is rejected by all of the residents of Catfish Row, with the exception of Porgy, who lets her in.

&quot;Scene 2: Serena&#x27;s Room, the following night&quot;

The mourners sing a spiritual to Robbins (&quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot;). To raise money for his burial, a saucer is placed on his chest for the mourners&#x27; donations (&quot;Overflow&quot;). Bess enters with Porgy and attempts to donate to the burial fund, but Serena rejects her money until Bess explains that she is now living with Porgy. A white detective enters and coldly tells Serena that she must bury her husband the next day, or his body will be given to medical students (for dissection). He suddenly accuses Peter of Robbins&#x27;s murder. Peter denies his guilt and says Crown was the murderer. The Detective orders Peter to be arrested as a material witness, whom he will force to testify against Crown. Serena laments her loss in &quot;My Man&#x27;s Gone Now&quot;. The undertaker enters. The saucer holds only fifteen dollars of the needed twenty-five, but he agrees to bury Robbins as long as Serena promises to pay him back. Bess, who has been sitting in silence slightly apart from the rest of those gathered, suddenly begins to sing a gospel song and the chorus joyfully join in, welcoming her into the community. (&quot;Oh, the Train is at de Station&quot;)

=== Act 2 ===
&quot;Scene 1: Catfish Row, a month later, in the morning&quot;

Jake and the other fishermen prepare for work (&quot;It take a long pull to get there&quot;). Clara asks Jake not to go because it is time for the annual storms, but he tells her that they desperately need the money. This causes Porgy to sing from his window about his new, happy-go-lucky outlook on life. (&quot;I got plenty o&#x27; nuttin&quot;). Sportin&#x27; Life waltzes around selling &quot;happy dust&quot;, but soon incurs the wrath of Maria, who threatens him. (&quot;I hates yo&#x27; struttin&#x27; style&quot;). A fraudulent lawyer, Frazier, arrives and farcically divorces Bess from Crown. When he discovers Bess and Crown were not married, he raises his price from a dollar to a dollar and a half. Archdale, a white lawyer, enters and informs Porgy that Peter will soon be released. The bad omen of a buzzard flies over Catfish Row and Porgy demands that it leave now that he finally has found happiness. (&quot;Buzzard keep on flyin&#x27; over&quot;.)

As the rest of Catfish Row prepares for the church picnic on nearby Kittiwah Island, Sportin&#x27; Life again offers to take Bess to New York with him; she refuses. He attempts to give her some &quot;happy dust&quot; despite her claims that she&#x27;s given up drugs, but Porgy grabs his arm and scares him off. Sportin&#x27; Life leaves, reminding Bess as he goes that her men friends come and go, but he will be there all along. Bess and Porgy are now left alone, and express their love for each other (&quot;Bess, You Is My Woman Now&quot;). The chorus re-enters in high spirits as they prepare to leave for the picnic (&quot;Oh, I can&#x27;t sit down&quot;). Bess is invited to the picnic by Maria, but she demurs as Porgy cannot come (due to his disability, he cannot get on the boat), but Maria insists. Bess leaves Porgy behind as they go off to the picnic. Porgy watches the boat leave (&quot;I got plenty o&#x27; nuttin&quot; reprise).

&quot;Scene 2: Kittiwah Island, that evening&quot;

The chorus enjoys themselves at the picnic (&quot;I ain&#x27;t got no shame&quot;). Sportin&#x27; Life presents the chorus his cynical views on the Bible (&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot;), causing Serena to chastise them (&quot;Shame on all you sinners!&quot;). Everyone gets ready to leave. As Bess, who has lagged behind, tries to follow them, Crown emerges from the bushes. He reminds her that Porgy is &quot;temporary&quot; and laughs off her claims that she has been living decently now. Bess wants to leave Crown forever and attempts to make him forget about her (&quot;Oh, what you want wid Bess?&quot;) but Crown refuses to give her up. He grabs her and will not let her go to the boat, which leaves without her, and then forcefully kisses her. He laughs at his conquest as her resistance begins to fail, and commands her to get into the woods, where his intentions are only too clear.

&quot;Scene 3: Catfish Row, a week later, just before dawn&quot;

A week later, Jake leaves to go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that it looks as if a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy&#x27;s room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since returning from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess&#x27;s affliction (&quot;Oh, Doctor Jesus&quot;), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o&#x27;clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares (&quot;Vendors&#x27; Trio&quot;). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay (&quot;I Wants to Stay Here&quot;), she is afraid of Crown&#x27;s hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her. Porgy promises that she will never have to be afraid again (&quot;I Loves You, Porgy&quot;).

Clara watches the water, fearful for Jake. Maria tries to allay her fears, but suddenly the hurricane bell begins to ring.

&quot;Scene 4: Serena&#x27;s Room, dawn of the next day&quot;

The residents of Catfish Row are all gathered in Serena&#x27;s room for shelter from the hurricane. They drown out the sound of the storm with prayers and hymns (&quot;Oh, Doctor Jesus&quot;) while Sportin&#x27; Life mocks their assumption that the storm is a signal of Judgment Day. Clara desperately sings her lullaby (&quot;Summertime&quot; [reprise]). A knock is heard at the door, and the chorus believes it to be Death (&quot;Oh there&#x27;s somebody knocking at the door&quot;). Crown enters dramatically, having swum from Kittiwah Island, seeking Bess. He shows no fear of God, claiming that after the long struggle from Kittiwah, God and he are friends. The chorus tries to drown out his blaspheming with more prayer, and he taunts them by singing a vulgar song (&quot;A red-headed woman&quot;). Suddenly, Clara sees Jake&#x27;s boat float past the window, upside-down, and she runs out to try to save him, handing her baby to Bess. Bess asks that one of the men go out with her, and Crown taunts Porgy, who cannot go. Crown goes himself, yelling out as he leaves &quot;Alright, Big Friend! We&#x27;re on for another Bout!&quot; The chorus continue to pray as the storm rises.

=== Act 3 ===
&quot;Scene 1: Catfish Row, the next night&quot;

A group of women mourn Clara, Jake, and all of those who have been killed in the storm (&quot;Clara, Clara, don&#x27;t you be downhearted&quot;). When they begin to mourn for Crown as well, Sportin&#x27; Life laughs at them and is told off by Maria. He insinuates that Crown may not be dead, and observes that when a woman has a man, maybe she&#x27;s got him for keeps, but if she has &quot;two&quot; men, then it&#x27;s highly likely she&#x27;ll end up with none. Bess is heard singing Clara&#x27;s lullaby to her baby, whom she is now taking care of. (&quot;Summertime&quot; [reprise]). Once Catfish Row is dark, Crown stealthily enters to claim Bess, but is confronted by Porgy. A fight ensues that ends when Porgy kills Crown. Porgy exclaims to Bess, &quot;You&#x27;ve got a man now. You&#x27;ve got Porgy!&quot;

&quot;Scene 2: Catfish Row, the next afternoon&quot;

The detective enters and talks with Serena and her friends about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny knowledge of Crown&#x27;s murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner&#x27;s inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown&#x27;s body. Sportin&#x27; Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed in the presence of their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin&#x27; Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York (&quot;There&#x27;s a boat dat&#x27;s leavin&#x27; soon for New York&quot;). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.

&quot;Scene 3: Catfish Row, a week later&quot;

On a beautiful morning, Porgy is released from jail, where he has been arrested for contempt of court after refusing to look at Crown&#x27;s body. He returns to Catfish Row much richer after playing craps with his cellmates. He gives gifts to the residents, and pulls out a beautiful red dress for Bess. He does not understand why everyone seems so uneasy at his return. He sees Clara&#x27;s baby is now with Serena and realizes something is wrong. He asks where Bess is. Maria and Serena tell him that Bess has run off with Sportin&#x27; Life to New York (&quot;Oh Bess, Oh Where&#x27;s my Bess?&quot;). Porgy calls for his goat cart, and resolves to leave Catfish Row to find her. He prays for strength, and begins his journey. (&quot;Oh, Lawd, I&#x27;m on my way&quot;)

== Racial controversy ==
Ira Gershwin stipulated that only black people be allowed to play the lead roles when the opera was performed in the United States, launching the careers of several prominent opera singers. Gershwin sought to write a true jazz opera and believed that Metropolitan Opera staff singers could never master the jazz idiom, which could instead only be sung by a black cast. Some black singers were overjoyed at Gershwin&#x27;s work, going so far as to describe him as the &quot;Abraham Lincoln of Negro music&quot;.

Nevertheless, the opera&#x27;s depiction of African Americans attracted controversy from the outset. Virgil Thomson, a white American composer, stated that &quot;Folklore subjects recounted by an outsider are only valid as long as the folk in question is unable to speak for itself, which is certainly not true of the American Negro in 1935.&quot; An apocryphal quote attributed to Duke Ellington allegedly stated &quot;the times are here to debunk Gershwin&#x27;s lampblack Negroisms,&quot; but the quote was probably invented by a journalist who interviewed Ellington about the opera. Ellington publicly repudiated the article shortly after its publication. Ellington&#x27;s response to the 1952 Breen revival was completely the opposite. His telegram to the producer read: &quot;Your &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; the superbest, singing the gonest, acting the craziest, Gershwin the greatest.&quot; Several of the members of the original cast later stated that they, too, had concerns that their characters might play into a stereotype that African Americans lived in poverty, took drugs, and solved their problems with their fists.

A planned production by the Negro Repertory Company of Seattle in the late 1930s, part of the Federal Theatre Project, was canceled because actors were displeased with what they viewed as a racist portrayal of aspects of African-American life. The director initially envisioned that they would perform the play in a &quot;Negro dialect.&quot; These Pacific Northwest African American actors, who did not speak in such dialect, would be coached in it. Florence James attempted a compromise of dropping the use of dialect but the production was canceled.

Another production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, this time at the University of Minnesota in 1939, ran into similar troubles. According to Barbara Cyrus, one of the few black students then at the university, members of the local African-American community saw the play as &quot;detrimental to the race&quot; and as a vehicle that promoted racist stereotypes. The play was canceled due to pressure from the African-American community, which saw their success as proof of the increasing political power of blacks in Minneapolis–Saint Paul.

The belief that &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was racist gained strength during the civil rights movement and Black Power movement of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. As these movements advanced, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was seen as more and more out of date. When the play was revived in the 1960s, social critic and African-American educator Harold Cruse called it, &quot;The most incongruous, contradictory cultural symbol ever created in the Western World.&quot;

In the 1976 Houston Opera production, the director, Sherwin Goldman, had trouble finding interested performers. Goldman, a white Texas native and a graduate of Yale and Oxford Universities, recalled, &quot;I was auditioning singers all around the country, I guess thirty cities in all, from theater groups to church choirs, but was having a hard time finding directors ... I don&#x27;t think there was a single black person, of those who had never been associated with Porgy, who didn&#x27;t seriously bad-mouth it.&quot; Nevertheless, a cast was assembled of African American classically trained performers from all around the country.

Gershwin&#x27;s all-black opera was also unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte declined to play Porgy in the late 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Poitier found the opera insulting and only took on the film role due to coercion from producer Samuel Goldwyn. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My way of dealing with it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.

Over time, however, the opera gained acceptance from the opera community and some in the African-American community. Maurice Peress stated in 2004 that &quot;&quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; belongs as much to the black singer-actors who bring it to life as it does to the Heywards and the Gershwins.&quot;

===Adaptations in other countries===

During the era of apartheid in South Africa, several South African theater companies planned to put on all-white productions of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. Ira Gershwin, as heir to his brother, consistently refused to permit these productions to be staged. But in 2009, Cape Town Opera&#x27;s production, set in 1970s South Africa and inspired by life in Soweto, toured Britain, opening at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff and going on to the Royal Festival Hall in London and Edinburgh Festival Theatre. Most of the cast were black South Africans; American singers involved in the production have found the &quot;passionate identification with the opera&quot; by the South African singers &quot;a wake-up call&quot;.

A 2017/2018 staging of the opera by the Hungarian State Opera featured a predominantly white cast. While the opera was presented in the context of the Syrian migrant crisis (moved from Catfish Row to an airport), the controversy of recasting continued. While the Hungarian State Opera, in discussions with the Tams-Witmark Music Library originally agreed to the casting requirements, it ultimately declined to do so when the wording was not included in the written contract. This production galvanized conservative commentators who lauded it as a success over &quot;political correctness&quot;. Ultimately, Tams-Witmark required the Hungarian State Opera to include in its printed material that this production &quot;is contrary to the requirements for the presentation of this work&quot;.

== Musical elements ==
In the summer of 1934, George Gershwin worked on the opera in Charleston, South Carolina. He drew inspiration from the James Island Gullah community, which he felt had preserved some African musical traditions.

The music reflects his New York jazz roots, but also draws on southern black traditions. Gershwin modeled the pieces after each type of folk song which the composer knew about; jubilees, blues, praying songs, street cries, work songs, and spirituals and blended them with arias and recitatives from European opera tradition.

The most fundamental influences on the composition and orchestrations in evidence throughout &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, aside from those of American jazz and black religious music, are the European composers whose music Gershwin studied and absorbed during his tutelage with the likes of Edward Kilenyi, Rubin Goldmark, Charles Hambitzer, and Henry Cowell. Cowell&#x27;s key contribution, however, may have been to suggest that Gershwin study with Joseph Schillinger, whose influence, if not as important as his followers claim, is notable throughout. Some commenters have believed they heard similarities to melodies heard in Jewish liturgical music in Gershwin&#x27;s opera. Gershwin biographer Edward Jablonski heard a similarity between the melody of &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot; and the Haftarah blessing, while others hear similarities with Torah blessing. In a sociological survey of Jewish American culture, the author remarked, &quot;One musicologist detected &#x27;an uncanny resemblance&#x27; between the folk tune &#x27;Havenu [sic] Shalom Aleichem&#x27; and the spiritual [sic] &#x27;It Take a Long Pull to Get There&#x27; from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.&quot;

The score makes use of a series of leitmotifs. Many of these represent individual characters: some of these are fragments of the opera&#x27;s set numbers (Sportin&#x27; Life, for example, is frequently represented by the melody which sets the title words of &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot;). Other motifs represent objects (such as the sleazy chromatic &quot;Happy Dust&quot; motif) or places, notably Catfish Row. Many of the through-composed passages of the score combine or develop these leitmotifs in order to reflect the on-stage action. Particularly sophisticated uses of this techniques can be seen after the aria &quot;There&#x27;s a boat dat&#x27;s leaving soon for New York&quot; in act 3, scene 2. The opera also frequently reprises its set numbers (these might be considered extended &quot;Leitsektionen&quot;). Notable in this respect are the reprises of &quot;Bess, you is my woman now&quot; and &quot;I got plenty o&#x27; nuttin&#x27; &quot; which conclude act 2, scene 1. The song &quot;Summertime&quot; is stated four times alone.

The duration of the work is about 180 minutes.

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for two flutes (second doubling piccolo), two oboes (second doubling English horn), three clarinets in B-flat (second and third doubling alto saxophones), one bass clarinet in B-flat (doubling fourth clarinet and tenor saxophone), one bassoon; three French horns in F, three trumpets in B-flat, one trombone, one bass trombone, one tuba; a percussion section that includes timpani, xylophone, triangle, glockenspiel, suspended and crash cymbals, snare drum, tom-toms, bass drum, African drums, an unspecified small drum, tubular bells, wood block, temple blocks, cowbell, sandpaper and train whistle; one piano; one banjo; and strings.

== Recordings ==
The 1976 and 1977 recordings of the opera won Grammy Awards for Best Opera Recording, making &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; the only opera to win this award over two consecutive years.

=== Excerpts ===
Days after the Broadway premiere of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; with an all-black cast, two white opera singers, Lawrence Tibbett and Helen Jepson, both members of the Metropolitan Opera, recorded highlights of the opera in a New York sound studio, released as &quot;Highlights from Porgy and Bess&quot;.

Members of the original cast were not recorded until 1940, when Todd Duncan and Anne Brown recorded selections from the work. Two years later, when the first Broadway revival occurred, American Decca rushed other members of the cast into the recording studio to record other selections not recorded in 1940. These two albums were marketed as a two-volume 78 rpm set &quot;Selections from George Gershwin&#x27;s Folk Opera Porgy and Bess&quot;. After LPs began to be manufactured in 1948, the recording was transferred to LP, and subsequently, to CD.

Also in 1940, baritone Bruce Foote released a 78-RPM album of selections from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

In 1942, Mabel Mercer and Cy Walter released a 78-RPM jazz album of excerpts from the opera on an obscure label.

Although members of the jazz community initially felt that a Jewish-American composer and a white novelist could not adequately convey the plight of black people in a 1930s Charleston ghetto, jazz musicians warmed up more to the opera after twenty years, and more jazz-based recordings of it began to appear. Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald recorded an album in 1957 in which they sang and scatted Gershwin&#x27;s tunes. The next year, Miles Davis recorded what some consider a seminal interpretation of the opera arranged for big band.

In 1959, Columbia Masterworks Records released a soundtrack album of Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s film version of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, which had been made that year. It was not a complete version of the opera, nor was it even a complete version of the film soundtrack, which featured more music than could be contained on a single LP. The album remained in print until the early 1970s, when it was withdrawn from stores at the request of the Gershwin estate. It is the first stereo album of music from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; with an all-black cast. However, according to the album liner notes, Sammy Davis Jr. was under contract to another recording company, and his vocal tracks for the film could not be used on the album. Cab Calloway substituted his own vocals of Sportin&#x27; Life&#x27;s songs. Robert McFerrin was the singing voice of Porgy, and Adele Addison the singing voice of Bess. The white singer Loulie Jean Norman was the singing voice of Clara (portrayed onscreen by Diahann Carroll), and Inez Matthews the singing voice of Serena (portrayed onscreen by Ruth Attaway).

In 1963, Leontyne Price and William Warfield, who had starred in the 1952 world tour of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, recorded their own album of excerpts from the opera for RCA Victor. None of the other singers from that production appeared on that album, but John W. Bubbles, the original Sportin&#x27; Life, substituted for Cab Calloway (who had played Sportin&#x27; Life onstage in the 1952 production). The 1963 recording of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; excerpts remains the only official recording of the score on which Bubbles sings Sportin&#x27; Life&#x27;s two big numbers.

In, 1976, for RCA Victor, Ray Charles and Cleo Laine recorded an album of excerpts in which the two of them sang several roles. The album was arranged and conducted by Frank De Vol. It featured the organ of Joe Sample, the trumpet of Harry Edison and guitar work of Joe Pass and Lee Ritenour. It was jazz-based with full orchestrations, but the orchestrations used were not Gershwin&#x27;s.

In 1990, Leonard Slatkin conducted an album of excerpts from the opera, released on a Philips Records CD, with Simon Estes (who sang Porgy in the first Metropolitan Opera production of the work) and Roberta Alexander.

=== Complete recordings ===
* 1951: Columbia Masterworks: the company recorded a 3-LP album of what was then the standard performing version of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;—the most complete recording made of the opera up to that time. It was billed as a &quot;complete&quot; version, but was complete only insofar as that was the way the work was usually performed then. (Actually, nearly an hour was cut from the opera.) Because album producer Goddard Lieberson was eager to bring as much of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; as he felt was practical on records at the time, the recording featured more of Gershwin&#x27;s original recitatives and orchestrations than had ever been heard before. The recording was conducted by Lehman Engel, and starred Lawrence Winters and Camilla Williams, both from the New York City Opera. Several singers who had been associated with the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; were finally given a chance to record their roles more or less complete. The album was highly acclaimed as a giant step in recorded opera in its time. It was re-released at budget price on the Odyssey label in the early 1970s. It has subsequently appeared on CD on Sony&#x27;s &quot;Masterworks Heritage&quot; CD series, and on the Naxos label as well. The album is not sung in as directly &quot;operatic&quot; a style as later versions, treading a fine line between opera and musical theater.
* 1952: Guild (not released until 2008): A live recording of a September 21, 1952, performance of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, starring Leontyne Price, William Warfield, Cab Calloway and the rest of the cast of the 1952 Davis-Breen revival. This is the only known recording of an actual performance made from the historic and highly acclaimed 1952 world tour of the opera. While the opera itself is not performed truly complete, it is a complete recording of that specific performance. Alexander Smallens, who led the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival, conducts. Some of the sung recitatives are still performed as spoken dialogue in the production.
* 1956: Bethlehem Records: A version of the opera more heavily oriented toward jazz than the original. Mel Tormé sings Porgy and Frances Faye is Bess. The only 3-LP version of most of the opera with white singers. (Released on CD by Rhino Records.)
* 1976: Decca Records: The first complete recording of the opera based on Gershwin&#x27;s original score, restoring the material cut by Gershwin during rehearsals for the New York premiere in 1935, was made by the Cleveland Orchestra under Lorin Maazel in 1976 for Decca Records in the UK and London Records in the U.S., in time for the U.S. Bicentennial. It starred Willard White singing his first Porgy, and Leona Mitchell as Bess.
* 1977: RCA Victor: A complete recording of the opera by the Houston Grand Opera based on the complete original score.
* 1989: EMI: The Glyndebourne album also based on the complete original score, without Gershwin&#x27;s cuts.
* 2006: Decca: A recording of the opera made by the Nashville Symphony under John Mauceri is the first to observe Gershwin&#x27;s cuts and thus present the opera as it was heard in New York in 1935. The musical cuts made on this album coincide almost exactly with those in the 1951 album, with the exception that &quot;The Buzzard Song&quot;, usually cut in early productions, is heard on the 1951 album, and the &quot;Occupational Humoresque&quot;, heard on the 2006 album, is not heard on the 1951 album at all. This version stars Marquita Lister as Bess.
* 2010: RCA Victor: Nikolaus Harnoncourt, an unusual choice for this Gershwin opera, conducted a recording of an almost complete &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, which was released in the U.S. in September 2010. Gregg Baker, who sang Crown in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production, the 1986 Glyndebourne production, the 1989 EMI recording made with the Glyndebourne cast, and in the 1993 television adaptation of that production, repeated his performance here, but the roles of Porgy and Bess are taken by two singers virtually unknown in the U.S., Jonathan Lemalu and Isabelle Kabatu.
* 2014: EuroArts Music International: DVD and Blu-ray recorded live by San Francisco Opera in June 2009, with Eric Owens and Laquita Mitchell in the title roles.

== Adaptations ==

=== Film ===

====1959 film====

A 1959 film adaptation, produced in 70 mm Todd-AO by Samuel Goldwyn, was plagued with problems. Rouben Mamoulian, who helmed the 1935 Broadway premiere, was hired to direct, but was subsequently fired in favor of director Otto Preminger, following a disagreement with the producer. Mamoulian urged making the film on location in South Carolina after a soundstage fire destroyed the sets. Goldwyn, who wasn&#x27;t a fan of on location production, considered Mamoulian&#x27;s request a sign of disloyalty.

Robert McFerrin dubs the singing voice for Sidney Poitier and Adele Addison for Dorothy Dandridge, with Ruth Attaway and Diahann Carroll also dubbed. Although Dandridge and Carroll were singers, their voices were not considered operatic enough. Sammy Davis Jr. (Sportin&#x27; Life), Brock Peters (Crown), and Pearl Bailey (Maria) were the only principals who provide their own singing. André Previn&#x27;s adaptation of the score won him an Academy Award, the film&#x27;s only Oscar. An associated soundtrack recording was released on LP by Columbia Masterworks Records. For the soundtrack album, Cab Calloway performed the songs sung by the Sportin’ Life character because Davis&#x27;s label, Decca records, released a competing album featuring Davis and Carmen McRae performing songs from the opera.

The Gershwin estate was disappointed with the film, as the score was substantially edited to make it more like a musical. Much of the music was ultimately omitted from the film, and many of Gershwin&#x27;s orchestrations were either changed or completely scrapped. It was shown on network television in the U.S. only once, in 1967. Critics lambasted it for not being faithful to the opera, for over-refining the language grammatically, and for its &quot;overblown&quot; staging. The film was removed from release in 1974 by the Gershwin estate. In 2011, it was selected to the U.S. National Film Registry.

Mike Medavoy and Bobby Geisler announced in 2019 that they are developing a re-envisioned and updated film version with the approval of the Gershwin estate. It is to be directed by Dee Rees.

====Other films====
&quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (1945), the Warner Bros. biopic of Gershwin, features an extended musical scene recreating the opening of the original Broadway production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. Included was the original Bess, Anne Brown, recreating her performance. The scene includes a more elaborate (and historically inaccurate) arrangement of &quot;Summertime&quot;, sung by Brown with a full chorus. However, the Catfish Row set design is a virtual duplicate of the one seen in the 1935 Broadway stage production.

&quot;White Nights&quot; (1985) features Gregory Hines performing &quot;There&#x27;s a Boat Dat&#x27;s Leavin&#x27; Soon for New York&quot; as Sportin&#x27; Life. Hines&#x27; rendition, before a Siberian audience, included a tap dance. Director Taylor Hackford pointed out in a special edition DVD release that it was necessary to locate a Russian woman of color (Helene Denbey) to portray Bess, as per Gershwin&#x27;s stipulations.

=== Television ===
In 1993, Trevor Nunn&#x27;s Glyndebourne Festival stage production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, not to be confused with his later production, was greatly expanded scenically and videotaped in a television studio without an audience. This first Nunn production was also called &quot;The Gershwins&#x27; &#x27;Porgy and Bess&#x27; &quot; when shown on television. It was telecast by the BBC in England and by PBS in the United States. It featured a cast of operatic American singers, with the exception of Willard White, who is Jamaican but sounded American, as Porgy. Cynthia Haymon sang the role of Bess. Nunn&#x27;s &quot;opening up&quot; of the stage production was considered highly imaginative; his cast received much critical praise, and the three-hour production retained nearly all of Gershwin&#x27;s music, heard in the original 1935 orchestrations. This included the opera&#x27;s sung recitatives, which have occasionally been turned into spoken dialogue in other productions. No extra dialogue was written for this production, as had been done in the 1959 film. All performers lip-synched rather than singing live on set, leading &quot;The New York Times&quot; to write: &quot;What you hear is basically Mr. Nunn&#x27;s acclaimed Glyndebourne Festival production, the original cast intact. What you see was filmed later in a London studio. The performers, some new to the production, are lip-synching. It&#x27;s as if an elaborate visual aid had been concocted for the EMI recording.&quot;

This &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; production was subsequently released on VHS and DVD. It has won far greater acclaim than the 1959 film, which was widely panned by most critics. The 1993 television production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was nominated for four Emmy Awards, and won for its art direction. It also won a BAFTA Award for Best Video Lighting.

In 2002, the New York City Opera telecast its new version of the Houston Opera production, in a live performance from the stage of Lincoln Center. This version featured far more cuts than the previous telecast, but, like nearly all stage versions produced since 1976, used the sung recitatives and Gershwin&#x27;s orchestrations. The telecast also included interviews with director Tazewell Thompson and was hosted by Beverly Sills.

In 2009 the San Francisco Opera debuted the Gershwins&#x27; &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; to critical acclaim. The production was recorded at that time and shown on PBS in the fall of 2014, and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.

=== Radio ===
On December 1, 1935, during the Broadway run, Todd Duncan and Anne Brown performed &quot;Summertime&quot;, &quot;I Got Plenty o&#x27; Nuttin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Bess, You Is My Woman Now&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Key of RCA&quot; radio program. Duncan and Brown also appeared on the 1937 CBS Gershwin memorial concert on September 8, 1937, broadcast from the Hollywood Bowl less than two months after the composer&#x27;s death, along with several other members of the Broadway cast, including John W. Bubbles and Ruby Elzy. They performed several selections from the opera.

The complete &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; has been broadcast by the Metropolitan Opera three times as part of the Met&#x27;s live radio broadcast series. The 1985 broadcast performance starred Simon Estes and Roberta Alexander. In 1986 Bumbry was heard with Robert Mosley as Porgy. In 1990, Estes and Leona Mitchell sang the leads in the third broadcast.

=== Concert ===
Gershwin prepared an orchestral suite containing music from the opera after &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; closed early on Broadway. Though it was originally titled &quot;Suite from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;&quot;, Ira later renamed it &quot;Catfish Row&quot;.

In 1942 Robert Russell Bennett arranged a medley (rather than a suite) for orchestra which has often been heard in the concert hall, known as &quot;Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture&quot;. It is based on Gershwin&#x27;s original scoring, though for a slightly different instrumentation (the piano was removed from the orchestral texture at the request of the conductor Fritz Reiner, for whom the arrangement was made). In addition, both Morton Gould and Robert Farnon each arranged an orchestral suite, premiering in 1956 and 1966, respectively.

* In 1991, experimental rock band When People Were Shorter and Lived Near the Water released the album &quot;Porgy&quot;, consisting entirely of their interpretations of songs from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, on Shimmy Disc. It was originally planned for release in 1990, but was held up by legal objections from the Gershwin estate.

== Songs ==
&quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; contains many songs that have become popular in their own right, becoming standards in jazz and blues in addition to their original operatic setting.

Some of the more celebrated renditions of these songs include Sarah Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot; and the versions of &quot;Summertime&quot; recorded by Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Jascha Heifetz in his own transcriptions for violin and piano.

Numerous other musicians have recorded &quot;Summertime&quot; in varying styles, including both instrumental and vocal recordings; it may be even the most popular cover song in popular music.
* Janis Joplin recorded a Blues rock version of &quot;Summertime&quot; with Big Brother and the Holding Company. Billy Stewart&#x27;s version became a Top 10 Pop and R&amp;B hit in 1966 for Chess Records.
* Even seemingly unlikely performers such as The Zombies (1965) or the ska punk band Sublime (as &quot;Doin&#x27; Time&quot;, 1997) have made recordings of &quot;Summertime&quot;. An international group of collectors of recordings of &quot;Summertime&quot; by the name &quot;The Summertime Connection&quot; claims more than 30,000 recorded performances (many live) in their collection.
* Nina Simone recorded several &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; songs. She made her debut in 1959 with a version of &quot;I Loves You, Porgy&quot;, which became a &quot;Billboard&quot; top 20 hit. Other songs she recorded included &quot;Porgy, I&#x27;s Your Woman Now&quot; [i.e. &quot;Bess, You Is My Woman Now&quot;], &quot;Summertime&quot; and &quot;My Man&#x27;s Gone Now&quot;.
* Phoebe Snow recorded a small jazz combo version of &quot;There&#x27;s a Boat Dat&#x27;s Leavin&#x27; Soon for New York&quot; on her &quot;Second Childhood&quot; album in 1976.
* Christina Aguilera performed &quot;I Loves You, Porgy&quot; in a tribute to the Nina Simone version at the 2008 Grammy Nominations Concert.
* The violinist Isaac Stern and the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber both recorded instrumental versions of &quot;Bess, You is My Woman Now&quot;.
* The Marcels, a racially diverse doo-wop group, recorded a version as a follow-up to their hit &quot;Blue Moon&quot; in 1961. It was unusual in that it was recorded in a major key rather than Gershwin&#x27;s minor key.

== Commendations ==
On July 14, 1993, the United States Postal Service recognized the opera&#x27;s cultural significance by issuing a commemorative 29-cent postage stamp.

In 2001, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was proclaimed the official opera of the state of South Carolina.

The 1940/1942 Decca &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; recording with members of the original cast was included by the National Recording Preservation Board in the Library of Congress, National Recording Registry in 2003. The board selects recordings on an annual basis that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

<doc id="219649" wikidata="Q800236" url="?curid=219649" title="Bahawalpur (princely state)">
<text>Bahawalpur (Urdu, ) was a princely state in subsidiary alliance with British Raj and later Dominion of Pakistan, that was a part of the Punjab States Agency. The state covered an area of and had a population of 1,341,209 in 1941. The capital of the state was the town of Bahawalpur.

The state was founded in 1748 by Nawab Bahawal Khan Abbasi. On 22 February 1833, Abbasi III entered into a subsidiary alliance with the British, by which Bahawalpur was admitted as a princely state. When British rule ended in 1947 and British Raj was partitioned into India and Pakistan, Bahawalpur joined the Dominion of Pakistan. Bahawalpur remained an autonomous entity until 14 October 1955, when it was merged with the province of West Pakistan.

==History==
The Kingdom of Bahawalpur was established by Bahawal Khan, who belonged to the Daudpotra tribe and had migrated from Shikarpur, Sindh in 1748. By the 18th century, Nawabs of Bahawalpur had consolidated power by settling his Daudpotra kinsmen on new canal lands along Sutlej.

As part of the 1809 Treaty of Amritsar, Ranjit Singh was confined to the right bank of the Sutlej. The first treaty with Bahawalpur was negotiated in 1833, the year after the treaty with Ranjit Singh for regulating traffic on the Indus. It secured the independence of the Nawab within his own territories and opened up the traffic on the Indus and Sutlej. The political relations of Bahawalpur with the British Raj were regulated by a treaty made in October 1838, when arrangements were in progress for the restoration of Shah Shuja to the Kabul throne.

During the First Anglo-Afghan War, the Nawab assisted the British with supplies and allowing passage and in 1847-8 he co-operated actively with Sir Herbert Edwardes in the expedition against Multan. For these services, he was rewarded by the grant of the districts of Sabzalkot and Bhung, together with a life-pension of a lakh. On his death, a dispute arose regarding succession. He was succeeded by his third son, whom he had nominated in place of his eldest son. The new ruler was, however, deposed by his elder brother, and obtained asylum in British territory, with a pension from the Bahawalpur revenues; he broke his promise to abandon his claims and was confined in the Lahore Fort, where he died in 1862.
In 1863 and 1866 insurrections broke out against the Nawab who successfully crushed the rebellions; but in March 1866, the Nawab died suddenly, not without suspicion of having been poisoned, and was succeeded by his son, Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan IV, a boy of four. After several endeavors to arrange for the administration of the country without active interference on the part of the Government, it was found necessary, on account of disorganization and disaffection, to place the principality in British hands. In 1879, the Nawab was invested with full powers, with the advice and assistance of a council of six members. During the Afghan campaigns (1878–80) the Nawab placed the entire resources of his State at the disposal of the British Indian Government, and a contingent of his troops was employed in keeping open communications, and in guarding the Dera Ghazi Khan frontier. On his death in 1899 he was succeeded by Muhammad Bahawal Khan V, who attained his majority in 1900, and was invested with full powers in 1903. The Nawab of Bahawalpur was entitled to a salute of 17 guns.

===Independence of Pakistan===

The predominantly Muslim population supported the Muslim League and the Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in Bahawalpur state. After the independence of Pakistan, the Nawab of Bahawalpur Sadeq Mohammad Khan V proved to be very helpful and generous to the government of Pakistan. He gave seventy million rupees to the government and the salaries of all the government departments for a couple of months were also drawn from the treasury of Bahawalpur state. He donated his private property to the University of the Punjab, King Edward Medical College and the Mosque of Aitchison College, Lahore. At the time of independence, all the princely states of British India were given a choice to join either Pakistan or India or to remain independent, outside both. On 5 October 1947 the Nawab signed an agreement with the government of Pakistan according to which Bahawalpur State acceded to Pakistan, and the accession was accepted on 9 October. Thus the State of Bahawalpur was the first state to accede to Pakistan.

== Demography ==

In 1941, Bahawalpur had a population of 1,341,209 of whom 737,474 (54.98%) were men and 603,735 (45.02%) were women. Bahawalpur had a literacy rate of 2.8% (5.1% for males and 0.1% for females) in 1901. The bulk of the population (two-thirds) lived on the fertile Indus River banks with the eastern desert tract being sparsely populated.
Between 1916 and 1941, the population had almost doubled due to the Sutlej Valley Project when vast amounts of Bahawalpur territory were opened to irrigation. There was a migration of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs to Bahawalpur from other parts of Punjab. These colonists were labelled non-Riyasatis as opposed to locals or &quot;Riyasatis&quot; and were systematically discriminated against in government appointments.
=== Religion ===
The state was predominantly Muslim. According to the 1941 census, Muslims made up 81.9% (1,098,814) of the state&#x27;s population while Hindus numbered 174,408 (13%) and Sikhs numbered 46,945 (1.84%). While a majority of Muslims and Hindus had their origins in Bahawalpur, a considerable proportion of settlers were migrants from other parts of the Punjab. The Sikhs, on the other hand, were predominantly colonists who had migrated after the opening of canal colonies. The largest Muslim castes were Khokhar, Gujjar, Jat and Baloch. The Syeds were also prominent. Most Hindus were Aroras and Khatris with a minority of Jats and Bishnois in Minchinabad and Haroonabad. Half of the Sikhs were Jatt Sikhs and half were Labanas and Rai Sikhs.
== Legacy ==

The Nawabs donated portions of their land in Lahore to Punjab University, while the mosque at Aitchison College was also donated by the Nawab. The Bahawalpur Block of the King Edward Medical College was also donated by the Nawab.

==Rulers==

The rulers of Bahawalpur took the title of Amir until 1740, when the title changed to Nawab Amir. Although the title was abolished in 1955 by the Government of Pakistan, the current head of the House of Bahawalpur (Salah ud-Din Muhammad Khan) is referred to as the &quot;Amir&quot;. From 1942, the Nawabs were assisted by Prime Ministers.

20th century onwards, Sadeq Muhammad Khan V was the Nawab and later Emir of Bahawalpur State from 1907 to 1966. He became the Nawab on the death of his father, when he was only three years old. In 1955 he signed an agreement with the Governor-General of Pakistan, Malik Ghulam Muhammad, under which Bahawalpur became part of the province of West Pakistan, with effect from 14 October 1955, and the Ameer received a yearly privy purse of 32 lakhs of rupees, keeping his titles. Other members of the present day form of the royal family include: HH Nawab Brig. Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi (Last Nawab of Bahawalpur, former Governor of Punjab); Nawab Salahuddin Ahmed Abbasi (Urdu: نواب صلاح الدین عباسی) who is a member of parliament in Pakistan. He is also the grandson of Sadeq Mohammad Khan V, who was the last ruling Nawab of the Princely State Bahawalpur. Prince Muhammad Bahawal (who studied at Aitchison College in Lahore, and graduated from King&#x27;s College London with a degree in International Political Economy and joined PTI), Prince Falahuddin Abbasi (who died in London in April 2016 from cancer), Begum of Bahawalpur, Princess Aiysha Yasmien Abbasi and Princess Safia Nausheen Abbasi.

<doc id="219650" wikidata="Q949662" url="?curid=219650" title="White's thrush">
<text>White&#x27;s thrush (Zoothera aurea) is a member of the thrush family, Turdidae. It was named after the English naturalist Gilbert White. The genus name &quot;Zoothera&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;zoon&quot;, &quot;animal&quot; and &quot;theras&quot;, &quot;hunter&quot;. The specific &quot;aurea&quot; is from Latin &quot;aureus&quot;, &quot;golden&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in wet coniferous taiga, mainly in the eastern Palearctic in Siberia to Manchuria, Korea and Japan. Northern races are strongly migratory, with most birds moving to southeastern Asia during the winter. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

==Description==
The sexes are similar, 27–31 cm long, with black scaling on a paler white or yellowish background. The most striking identification feature in flight is the black band on the white underwings, a feature shared with Siberian thrush. The male has a song which is a loud, far-carrying mechanical whistle, with 5–10 second pauses between each one second long phrase &quot;twee...tuuu...tuuu...tuuu&quot;.

It was previously considered a subspecies of the scaly thrush.

<doc id="219657" wikidata="Q8583" url="?curid=219657" title="Vulkaneifel">
<text>Vulkaneifel () is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the northwest of the state Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is the least densely populated district in the state and the fourth most sparsely populated district in Germany. The administrative centre of the district is in Daun. Neighboring districts are Euskirchen (North Rhine-Westphalia), Ahrweiler, Mayen-Koblenz, Cochem-Zell, Bernkastel-Wittlich, and Bitburg-Prüm.

== Location ==

The county of Vulkaneifel lies in the western part of the eponymous region which lies at heights between 150 and 700 metres above sea level.
As a result of former volcanism numerous mineral springs (&quot;Sauerbrunnen&quot;) have formed. The Kyll flows through the county from north to south. The German Wildlife Route and the German Volcano Route also cross the county as does the Eifelsteig hiking trail.

==History==
The district was created in 1815 when the Eifel became part of Prussia. As most of the local industries had their traditional markets in France, the district fell into a severe economic crisis. The construction of a railroad in the second half of the 19th century helped it to recover. The construction of the Nürburgring in 1927 was also an infrastructural project that helped the local economy. The district was enlarged significantly in 1970–1971, when the districts Mayen and Prüm were dissolved and parts were added to the Daun district.

On January 1, 2007, the district Daun was renamed &quot;Vulkaneifel&quot;, the name of the landscape.

==Geography==
The district is located in the Eifel mountains, containing volcanic lakes called maars. The largest river in the district is the Kyll.

The Vulkaneifel consists of three regions: Vulkanische Osteifel (municipalities of Brohltal, Vordereifel, Mendig, Pellenz), Vulkanische Hocheifel (municipalities of Kelberg, Ulmen, and the village of Nohn), and Vulkanische Westeifel (remainder of the municipality of Hillesheim, and municipalities Obere Kyll, Gerolstein, Manderscheid, Daun).

==Tourism==
Places of interest in the Vulkaneifel include the maar lakes around Daun, and Manderscheid, as well as the caldera lake of Laacher See at the abbey of Maria Laach, which is the largest, and the youngest within the region. Hiking and cycling trails dot the region.

Museums in the Vulkaneifel include the Lava-Dome (the German volcanic museum) in Mendig, the Vulkanhaus in Strohn, and the Eifel-Vulkanmuseum in Daun.

The Vulkaneifel contains three geological parks (2004,45 km2), the Vulkanpark Brohltal/Laacher See, the Vulkanpark Osteifel, and the Vulkaneifel European Geopark.

The Castle of Eltz and the Castle of Lissingen are well preserved castles in the Vulkaneifel.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show the symbols of three territories which historically made up the district. In the left is the cross of Trier, the lion in the right represents the Counts of Blankenheim-Gerolstein. The escutcheon in the middle show the arms of the Counts of Daun.

<text>Gemütlichkeit () is a German-language word used to convey the idea of a state or feeling of warmth, friendliness, and good cheer. Other qualities encompassed by the term include cosiness, peace of mind, and a sense of belonging and well-being springing from social acceptance. The adjective &quot;gemütlich&quot; is translated as &quot;cosy&quot;, so &quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot; could be simply translated as &quot;cosiness&quot;.

==History and etymology==
&quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot; derives from &quot;gemütlich&quot;, the adjective of &quot;Gemüt&quot;, which means &quot;heart, mind, temper, feeling&quot; expressed by (and cognate with) English &quot;mood&quot;. The German abstract noun &quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot; has been adopted into English. The current meaning of the word derives from its use in the Biedermeier period. By the second half of the 19th century, it also became associated with a set of traits supposedly unique to the Austrian culture. 

The word can be used in descriptions of holidays. In the 1973 English contract law case &quot;Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd&quot;, a holidaymaker sued after not receiving the &quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot; promised by the promotional literature for a package holiday to the Swiss Alps.

The communal connotations of &quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot; are also emphasized in some uses of the term. For example, one academic described it as a tradition of &quot;public festivity&quot; (in the form of a &quot;mixture of music, food, and drink&quot;), which &quot;promote[d] community solidarity.&quot; 

&quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot; has been appropriated at least once to describe the tenor of an economic era rather than spirit of a social gathering. In analyzing the &quot;inflation dampening effects of globalization&quot; an American professor wrote that certain U.S. economic trends could &quot;spell an end of the Gemütlichkeit — a situation in which cheap labor and money abroad as well as ever-increasing productivity at home had permitted an uninterrupted spell of controlled growth in overall prices&quot;.

==Similar words in other languages==
English has no direct translation for &quot;gemütlich&quot; or &quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot;. &quot;Cosy&quot; captures an element of it but crucially lacks those of friendliness and belonging. Another possible translation could be &quot;comfort&quot;.

The Swedish-language equivalent is &quot;gemytlig&quot;, deriving directly from the German word and sharing its meaning. But the word &quot;mysig&quot; has identical connotations to Danish &quot;hygge.&quot;

Danish also has &quot;gemytlig&quot; but uses &quot;hygge&quot; (hyggelig as an adjective) instead. In Norwegian the word is rendered &quot;gemyttlig&quot;, but words such as &quot;hyggelig&quot; and &quot;&quot; which means cosy, comfortable, nice, or pleasant, are analogues.

The Dutch equivalent &quot;gezelligheid&quot;, derived from the adjective &quot;gezellig&quot;, has broader social connotations than the German &quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot; and can be more accurately compared to the Danish term &quot;hygge&quot;.

In Bulgarian and Russian, &quot;уют&quot; ( and , respectively) means cosiness, comfort, contentment, ease, and carries almost identical connotations to the German word. In Ukrainian &quot;затишок&quot; ( means comfort and quietness. 

The Romance languages with Latin roots do not have a single term expressing the many connotations of &quot;Gemütlichkeit&quot;.

<text>Titania (), also designated Uranus III, is the largest moon of Uranus. At a diameter of it is the eighth largest moon in the Solar System, with a surface area comparable to that of Australia. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, it is named after the queen of the fairies in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Its orbit lies inside Uranus&#x27;s magnetosphere.

Titania consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water may be present at the core–mantle boundary. Its surface, which is relatively dark and slightly red in color, appears to have been shaped by both impacts and endogenic processes. It is covered with numerous impact craters reaching up to in diameter, but is less heavily cratered than Oberon, outermost of the five large moons of Uranus. It may have undergone an early endogenic resurfacing event which obliterated its older, heavily cratered surface. Its surface is cut by a system of enormous canyons and scarps, the result of the expansion of its interior during the later stages of its evolution. Like all major moons of Uranus, Titania probably formed from an accretion disk which surrounded the planet just after its formation.

Infrared spectroscopy conducted from 2001 to 2005 revealed the presence of water ice as well as frozen carbon dioxide on Titania&#x27;s surface, suggesting it may have a tenuous carbon dioxide atmosphere with a surface pressure of about 10 nanopascals (10−13 bar). Measurements during Titania&#x27;s occultation of a star put an upper limit on the surface pressure of any possible atmosphere at 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar). The Uranian system has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in January 1986. It took several images of Titania, which allowed mapping of about 40% of its surface.

== Discovery and naming ==

Titania was discovered by William Herschel on January 11, 1787, the same day he discovered Uranus&#x27;s second largest moon, Oberon. He later reported the discoveries of four more satellites, although they were subsequently revealed as spurious. For nearly the next 50 years, Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel&#x27;s, although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present-day high-end amateur telescope.

All of Uranus&#x27;s moons are named after characters created by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. The name Titania was taken from the Queen of the Fairies in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by Herschel&#x27;s son John in 1852, at the request of William Lassell, who had discovered the other two moons, Ariel and Umbriel, the year before. It is uncertain if Herschel devised the names, or if Lassell did so and then sought Herschel&#x27;s permission.

Titania was initially referred to as &quot;the first satellite of Uranus&quot;, and in 1848 was given the designation &#x27; by William Lassell, although he sometimes used William Herschel&#x27;s numbering (where Titania and Oberon are II and IV). In 1851 Lassell eventually numbered all four known satellites in order of their distance from the planet by Roman numerals, and since then Titania has been designated &#x27;.

Shakespeare&#x27;s character&#x27;s name is pronounced , but the moon is often pronounced , by analogy with the familiar chemical element titanium. The adjectival form, &quot;Titanian&quot;, is homonymous with that of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. The name &quot;Titania&quot; is ancient Greek for &quot;Daughter of the Titans&quot;.

== Orbit ==

Titania orbits Uranus at the distance of about , being the second farthest from the planet among its five major moons after Oberon. Titania&#x27;s orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 8.7 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Titania is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward the planet.

Titania&#x27;s orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).

Because Uranus orbits the Sun almost on its side, and its moons orbit in the planet&#x27;s equatorial plane, they (including Titania) are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the zenith over one of the poles at each solstice. The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere&#x27;s 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire southern hemisphere was illuminated. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus&#x27;s moons become possible. In 2007–2008 a number of such events were observed including two occultations of Titania by Umbriel on August 15 and December 8, 2007.

== Composition and internal structure ==

Titania is the largest and most massive Uranian moon, the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System, and the 20th largest object in the Solar System. Its density of 1.68 g/cm3, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn&#x27;s satellites, indicates that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline water ice on the surface of the moon. Water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania&#x27;s leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on Oberon, where the trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma&#x27;s co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.

Except for water, the only other compound identified on the surface of Titania by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide, which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials under the influence of the solar ultraviolet radiation or energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus. The latter process would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, because the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the outgassing of the primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Titania&#x27;s interior. The escape of CO2 from the interior may be related to the past geological activity on this moon.

Titania may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core is about 66% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 58% of the moon&#x27;s mass—the proportions are dictated by moon&#x27;s composition. The pressure in the center of Titania is about 0.58 GPa (5.8 kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Titania may have a subsurface ocean at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to and its temperature is around 190 K (close to the water–ammonia eutectic temperature of 176 K). However the present internal structure of Titania depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known. Recent studies suggest, contrary to earlier theories, that Uranus largest moons like Titania in fact could have active subsurface oceans.

== Surface features ==

Among Uranus&#x27;s moons, Titania is intermediate in brightness between the dark Oberon and Umbriel and the bright Ariel and Miranda. Its surface shows a strong opposition surge: its reflectivity decreases from 35% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 25% at an angle of about 1°. Titania has a relatively low Bond albedo of about 17%. Its surface is generally slightly red in color, but less red than that of Oberon. However, fresh impact deposits are bluer, while the smooth plains situated on the leading hemisphere near Ursula crater and along some grabens are somewhat redder. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8%. However, this difference is related to the smooth plains and may be accidental. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Titania is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would be deposited predominately on the leading hemisphere.

Scientists have recognized three classes of geological feature on Titania: craters, chasmata (canyons) and rupes (scarps). The surface of Titania is less heavily cratered than the surfaces of either Oberon or Umbriel, which means that the surface is much younger. The crater diameters reach 326 kilometers for the largest known crater, Gertrude (there can be also a degraded basin of approximately the same size). Some craters (for instance, Ursula and Jessica) are surrounded by bright impact ejecta (rays) consisting of relatively fresh ice. All large craters on Titania have flat floors and central peaks. The only exception is Ursula, which has a pit in the center. To the west of Gertrude there is an area with irregular topography, the so-called &quot;unnamed basin&quot;, which may be another highly degraded impact basin with the diameter of about .

Titania&#x27;s surface is intersected by a system of enormous faults, or scarps. In some places, two parallel scarps mark depressions in the satellite&#x27;s crust, forming grabens, which are sometimes called canyons. The most prominent among Titania&#x27;s canyons is Messina Chasma, which runs for about from the equator almost to the south pole. The grabens on Titania are wide and have a relief of about 2–5 km. The scarps that are not related to canyons are called rupes, such as Rousillon Rupes near Ursula crater. The regions along some scarps and near Ursula appear smooth at &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s image resolution. These smooth plains were probably resurfaced later in Titania&#x27;s geological history, after the majority of craters formed. The resurfacing may have been either endogenic in nature, involving the eruption of fluid material from the interior (cryovolcanism), or, alternatively it may be due to blanking by the impact ejecta from nearby large craters. The grabens are probably the youngest geological features on Titania—they cut all craters and even smooth plains.

The geology of Titania was influenced by two competing forces: impact crater formation and endogenic resurfacing. The former acted over the moon&#x27;s entire history and influenced all surfaces. The latter processes were also global in nature, but active mainly for a period following the moon&#x27;s formation. They obliterated the original heavily cratered terrain, explaining the relatively low number of impact craters on the moon&#x27;s present-day surface. Additional episodes of resurfacing may have occurred later and led to the formation of smooth plains. Alternatively smooth plains may be ejecta blankets of the nearby impact craters. The most recent endogenous processes were mainly tectonic in nature and caused the formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust. The cracking of the crust was caused by the global expansion of Titania by about 0.7%.

== Atmosphere ==

The presence of carbon dioxide on the surface suggests that Titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of CO2, much like that of the Jovian moon Callisto. Other gases, like nitrogen or methane, are unlikely to be present, because Titania&#x27;s weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space. At the maximum temperature attainable during Titania&#x27;s summer solstice (89 K), the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is about 300 μPa (3 nbar).

On September 8, 2001, Titania occulted a bright star (HIP 106829) with a visible magnitude of 7.2; this was an opportunity to both refine Titania&#x27;s diameter and ephemeris, and to detect any extant atmosphere. The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar); if it exists, it would have to be far thinner than that of Triton or Pluto. This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible surface pressure of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.

The peculiar geometry of the Uranian system causes the moons&#x27; poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this may lead to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface. Titania is thought to have lost a significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.

== Origin and evolution ==

Titania is thought to have formed from an accretion disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the relatively high density of Titania and other Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of nitrogen and carbon may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide and N2 instead of ammonia and methane. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as a clathrate) and more rock, explaining their higher density.

Titania&#x27;s accretion probably lasted for several thousand years. The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon&#x27;s outer layer. The maximum temperature of around was reached at a depth of about . After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Titania heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon&#x27;s crust leading to cracking. Some of the present-day canyons may be a result of this. The process lasted for about 200 million years, implying that any endogenous activity ceased billions of years ago.

The initial accretional heating together with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably strong enough to melt the ice if some antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or salt was present. Further melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is . If the temperature dropped below this value, the ocean would have subsequently frozen. The freezing of the water would have caused the interior to expand, which may have been responsible for the formation of the majority of the canyons. However, the present knowledge of Titania&#x27;s geological evolution is quite limited. Whereas more up to date analysis suggest that larger moons of Uranus are not only capable of having active subsurface oceans; but in fact; presumed to have subterranean oceans beneath them.

== Exploration ==

So far the only close-up images of Titania have been from the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest distance between &quot;Voyager 2&quot; and Titania was only , the best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 3.4 km (only Miranda and Ariel were imaged with a better resolution). The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 24% was photographed with the precision required for geological mapping. At the time of the flyby, the southern hemisphere of Titania (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied.

No other spacecraft has ever visited the Uranian system or Titania. One possibility, now discarded, was to send &quot;Cassini&quot; on from Saturn to Uranus in an extended mission. Another mission concept proposed was the Uranus orbiter and probe concept, evaluated around 2010. Uranus was also examined as part of one trajectory for a precursor interstellar probe concept, Innovative Interstellar Explorer.

The Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission architecture was identified as the highest priority for a NASA Flagship mission by the 2023–2032 Planetary Science Decadal Survey. The science questions motivating this prioritization include questions about the Uranian satellites&#x27; bulk properties, internal structure, and geologic history. A Uranus orbiter had previously been listed as the third priority for a NASA Flagship mission by the 2013–2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey.

<text>San José (; meaning &quot;Saint Joseph&quot;) is the capital and largest city of Costa Rica, and the capital of San José Province. It is in the center of the country, in the mid-west of the Central Valley, within San José Canton. San José is Costa Rica&#x27;s seat of national government, focal point of political and economic activity, and major transportation hub. San José is simultaneously one of Costa Rica&#x27;s cantons, with its municipal land area covering 44.62 square kilometers (17.23 square miles) and having within it an estimated population of people in 2022. Together with several other cantons of the central valley, including Alajuela, Heredia and Cartago, it forms the country&#x27;s Greater Metropolitan Area, with an estimated population of over 2 million in 2017. The city is named in honor of Joseph of Nazareth.

Founded in 1736 by order of Cabildo de León, the population of San José rose during the 18th century through the use of colonial planning. It has historically been a city of strategic importance, having been the capital of Costa Rica three times. More than a million people pass through it daily. It is home to the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, the National Theatre of Costa Rica, and La Sabana Metropolitan Park. Juan Santamaría International Airport serves the city.

San José is notable among Latin American cities for its high quality of life, security, level of globalization, environmental performance, public service, and recognized institutions. In 2012, San José was one of the safest and least violent cities in the region. It is considered a &quot;Beta-&quot; global city by GaWC. San José joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016.

==History==

The population of San José grew during the eighteenth-century colonization planning, which was different from the traditional foundation plans of Spanish cities in the continent of Central America.

Founded in 1736 by order of Cabildo de León, its objective was to concentrate the scattered inhabitants of the Aserrí Valley. De León thus ordered the construction of a chapel near the area known as which was completed a year later. That year St. Joseph was chosen as parish patron, hence its name. The chapel, which was very modest, was erected with help from the church of Cartago.

Unlike neighboring Cartago, San José was not founded by formal decree and thus lacked a city government. It was not until the enactment of the Constitution of Cádiz in 1812 that San José had its first city government. On 18 October 1813, the area was first defined as a city by presbyter Florencio del Castillo, on behalf of the Spanish government, a title which was then lost in 1814 when Ferdinand VII of Spain annulled the proceedings of the courts. The municipal government was restored in 1820 along with the title of city and in 1823 San José became the capital of Costa Rica. This makes San José one of the youngest capital cities in Latin America by year of conception.

Population and economic growth were spurred by improvements in access to water and the installment of the Tobacco Factory in 1782. The accumulation of capital brought by tobacco plantations allowed the city to economically surpass neighboring provinces.

The first modern urban neighborhood carries the name of its founder, the French coffee entrepreneur Monsieur Amon, and was created in the late 19th century, in line with Belle Époque contemporary architecture. Barrio Amon, as well as the National Theatre, remain symbols of the so-called Costa Rican coffee golden age.

Today San José is a modern city with bustling commerce and brisk expressions of art and architecture. Spurred by the country&#x27;s improved tourism industry, it is a significant destination and stopover for foreign visitors.

San José exerts a strong influence because of its proximity to other cities (Alajuela, Heredia and Cartago) and the country&#x27;s demographic assemblage in the Central Valley.

==Districts==
The borders of San José city, as defined in the Administrative Territorial Division and stipulated in the Executive Decree 11562 of 27 May 1980, assign the borders of San José canton except an East sector of Uruca district. Therefore the city is composed of the totality of the districts of Carmen, Merced, Hospital, Catedral, Zapote, San Francisco de Dos Ríos, Mata Redonda, Pavas, Hatillo, San Sebastián and partially of Uruca district.

== Demographics ==

For the 2022 population estimate, San José had a population of inhabitants, more than any other canton in the country and up from people, according the 2011 census. The canton has a population density of 

Most of the population is distributed in the peripheral districts around the downtown (the districts of El Carmen, Merced, Hospital, and Catedral are known as similar to a downtown or financial center, only 18% of the canton population inhabits these districts).

In 2022, the canton had 0.92 men per woman, a small change from 0.90 men per woman in 2011. In 2000, the province had 100% of urban population. 17.33% of its inhabitants are under ten, and 7.67% are over 65.

== Government ==

=== Mayor ===

According to Costa Rica&#x27;s Municipal Code, mayors are elected every four years by the population of the canton. As of the latest municipal elections in 2024, the Together San José candidate, Luis Diego Miranda Méndez, was elected mayor of the canton with 23.95% of the votes, with Yariela Franciny Quirós Álvarez and Fernando Antonio Vega Guillén as first and second vice mayors, respectively.

=== Municipal Council ===
Like the mayor and vice mayors, members of the Municipal Council (called ) are elected every four years. San José&#x27;s Municipal Council has 11 seats for regidores and their substitutes, who can participate in meetings but not vote unless the owning regidor () is absent. The current president of the Municipal Council is Together San José Party member, Mariana de los Ángeles Zúñiga Pérez, with the regidor for More San José Party, Juan Diego Gómez González, as vice president. The Municipal Council&#x27;s composition for the 2024-2028 period is as follows:

==Climate==
San José has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Precipitation varies widely between the driest month () and the wettest month (), while average temperatures vary little. The hottest month is April with an average temperature of , while the coolest month is October with an average temperature of .
==Education==
Costa Rica has developed high education levels. As of 2011 97.6% of the population over 10 was literate, 96% of children aged 6–11 attend primary school and 71% of students of high-school age attend high-school. The country as a whole has the highest education levels in Central America and one of the best in Latin America. This is especially true for San José, the nation&#x27;s educational hub home to a large number of public and private universities.

University of Santo Tomas, the first university of Costa Rica, was established here in 1843. That institution maintained close ties with the Roman Catholic Church and was closed in 1888 by the progressive and anti-clerical government of President Bernardo Soto Alfaro as part of a campaign to modernize public education. The schools of law, agronomy, fine arts, and pharmacy continued to operate independently, but Costa Rica had no university proper until 1940, when those four schools were re-united to establish the modern University of Costa Rica (UCR), during the reformist administration of President Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia. The University for Peace, an intergovernmental organization with university status, established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1980, is located in San José.

The city&#x27;s public education system is composed of pre-schools, elementary and high schools (from grades 7 to 11), which are located in all of the city&#x27;s districts and are under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Education. Nevertheless, private institutions do exist within the city. These educational institutions range from pre-schools to universities. Most tend to be bilingual, teaching subjects in either French or English and Spanish, among other languages, apart from just teaching a certain language.

==Security==
San José is one of Latin America&#x27;s safest cities. As of 19 June 2012, both city and nation reduced their crime indices considerably. Nationwide, crime was reduced from 12.5 to 9.5 incidents per 100,000 inhabitants.

In 2012, new police equipment was issued by the government, and the security budget was increased. President Laura Chinchilla&#x27;s government donated vehicles and other equipment to the police department on at least two occasions.

The city&#x27;s greater metropolitan area (in Los Yoses, San Pedro) also serves as the headquarters of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.

==Major landmarks==


===Theaters and auditoriums===
San José has a number of theaters, many with European-inspired architecture. These buildings serve as the city&#x27;s main tourist attractions, not only because of their architecture, but because of the cultural, musical, and artistic presentations and activities, which include traditional and modern Costa Rican and San Josefinan culture.

The most well-known are:
*The National Theater of Costa Rica (&quot;Teatro Nacional de Costa Rica&quot;).
*The Melico Salazar Theater (&quot;Teatro Popular Melico Salazar&quot;).
*The National Auditorium of The Children&#x27;s Museum of Costa Rica (&quot;Museo de los Niños&quot;).

The National Theater of Costa Rica (considered the finest historic building in the capital and known for its exquisite interior which includes its lavish Italian furnishings) and the Melico Salazar Theater present drama, dance performances and concerts throughout the year. Nevertheless, other &#x27;smaller&#x27; theaters can be found throughout the city and provide a large array of entertainment.

El Teatro Variedades (1892) is San José&#x27;s oldest theater.

==Transportation==
San José has several internal transportation networks that connect the city districts and metropolitan area; as well as national transportation networks that connect the city to other parts of Costa Rica.

San José is undergoing modernization in transportation. In February of 2011, the former mayor, Johnny Araya, along with then Costa Rican President, Laura Chinchilla, announced the establishment of an urban tramway system that will, in its first phase, cover the central core of the city going from west to east.

On 27 September 2012, San José disclosed plans to install its first street signs, about 22,000 signs and plaques. It is estimated that the lack of proper street names for directions causes the loss of $720 million a year by the Inter-American Development Bank in 2008, due to undelivered, returned or re-sent mail.

=== Roads ===
The following national road routes cover the city:
===Buses===
Private bus companies connect different areas of the city with each other and the suburbs. Services to other parts of the country are provided by other private companies which have stations or stops spread all over the city center. There are also bus services between Juan Santamaría International Airport and downtown San José.

===Train===
The &quot;Instituto Costarricense de Ferrocarriles&quot;, or the state-owned railway institute, is in charge of all of Costa Rica&#x27;s railways. In 2004, this institution began work on the establishment of an inter-urban railway network. This network would connect Tibás, Heredia, San Antonio de Belén, Pavas, San Pedro de Montes de Oca, Sabanilla, and Curridabat, among other locations.

There are plans to expand this inter-urban railway system into Cartago, Alajuela, and the Juan Santamaría International Airport.

Trains run to Heredia from &quot;Estación Atlantico and San Antonio de Belen&quot; and from &quot;Estación Pacifico&quot;.

===Taxis===
San José public taxi services complement the urban transportation network. Taxis are characterized by their red color and belong to registered cooperatives. There are other taxi services which do not belong to the registered system, there are also taxis from the airport that are usually orange.

The car-sharing company Uber is active in Costa Rica and, despite repeated clashes with and strikes by taxi drivers protesting unfair competition, continues to operate in the country.

===Airports===
The city is serviced by Juan Santamaría International Airport , west of downtown, in the city of Alajuela, which is one of the busiest airports in Central America. In 2011, the airport was named the 3rd Best Airport in Latin America/Caribbean from the Airport Service Quality Awards by Airports Council International. In 2023, Juan Santamaría International Airport received 5.6 million passengers, most of them from international flights. 

The airport is undergoing a modernization plan, which is expected to be brief. The previous remodeling done to the airport cost around $7 million.

Another important airport in San José is Tobías Bolaños International Airport . It is located north-west of the city proper and south-east of Juan Santamaría International Airport.

==Cuisine==

Costa Rican cuisine, called (&quot;traditional food&quot;), is generally not spicy. Throughout San José, the most popular food is the national dish of (&quot;painted chicken&quot;), which is black beans served with white rice. &quot;Gallo pinto&quot; is usually served for breakfast with tortillas and , a thin sour cream. Costa Rican restaurants serving traditional food at an affordable price are called &quot;sodas&quot; and usually offer substantial for lunch and dinner. A &quot;casado&quot; (meaning &quot;married&quot; or &quot;married man&quot; in Spanish) consists of rice, beans, and meat, with cabbage-and-tomato salad, fried plantains, and tortillas. San José Central Market, in downtown San José, has numerous food markets and sodas.

==Sports==
The city&#x27;s major football club is Deportivo Saprissa, which has won a record 36 league titles. The team plays its home games at the Estadio Ricardo Saprissa Aymá, which is located in Tibas. Another top-level club, Universidad, plays at the Estadio Ecológico.

<text>The Karakoram () is a mountain range in the Kashmir region spanning the border of Pakistan, China, and India, with the northwestern extremity of the range extending to Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Most of the Karakoram mountain range is within Pakistan&#x27;s Gilgit-Baltistan region, the northern subdivision of Kashmir. 

Karakoram&#x27;s highest and the world&#x27;s second-highest peak, K2, is located in Gilgit-Baltistan. The mountain range begins in the Wakhan Corridor in Afghanistan in the west, encompasses the majority of Gilgit-Baltistan, controlled by Pakistan and then extends into Ladakh, controlled by India and Aksai Chin, controlled by China. It is part of the larger Trans-Himalayan mountain ranges.

The Karakoram is the second-highest mountain range on Earth and part of a complex of ranges that includes the Pamir Mountains, Hindu Kush, and the Indian Himalayas.

The range contains 18 summits higher than in elevation, with four above : K2 ( AMSL) (the second-highest peak on Earth), Gasherbrum I, Broad Peak, and Gasherbrum II.

The range is about in length and is the most glaciated place on Earth outside the polar regions. The Siachen Glacier ( long) and Biafo Glacier ( long) are the second- and third-longest glaciers outside the polar regions.

The Karakoram is bounded on the east by the Aksai Chin plateau, on the northeast by the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and on the north by the river valleys of the Yarkand and Karakash rivers beyond which lie the Kunlun Mountains. At the northwest corner are the Pamir Mountains. The southern boundary of the Karakoram is formed, west to east, by the Gilgit, Indus and Shyok rivers, which separate the range from the northwestern end of the Himalaya range proper. These rivers flow northwest before making an abrupt turn southwestward towards the plains of Pakistan. Roughly in the middle of the Karakoram range is the Karakoram Pass, which was part of a historic trade route between Ladakh and Yarkand that is now inactive.

The Tashkurghan National Nature Reserve and the Pamir Wetlands National Nature Reserve in the Karalorun and Pamir mountains have been nominated for inclusion in UNESCO in 2010 by the National Commission of the People&#x27;s Republic of China for UNESCO and have been tentatively added to the list.

== Name ==

Karakoram is a Turkic term meaning &quot;black gravel&quot;. The Central Asian traders originally applied the name to the Karakoram Pass. Early European travellers, including William Moorcroft and George Hayward, started using the term for the range of mountains west of the pass, although they also used the term Muztagh (meaning, &quot;Ice Mountain&quot;) for the range now known as Karakoram. Later terminology was influenced by the Survey of India, whose surveyor Thomas Montgomerie in the 1850s gave the labels K1 to K6 (K for Karakoram) to six high mountains visible from his station at Mount Haramukh in Kashmir Valley, codes extended further up to more than thirty.

In traditional Indian geography the mountains were known as Krishnagiri (black mountains), &quot;Kanhagiri&quot; and &quot;Kanheri&quot;.

== Exploration ==
Due to its altitude and ruggedness, the Karakoram is much less inhabited than parts of the Himalayas further east. European explorers first visited early in the 19th century, followed by British surveyors starting in 1856.

The Muztagh Pass was crossed in 1887 by the expedition of Colonel Francis Younghusband and the valleys above the Hunza River were explored by General Sir George K. Cockerill in 1892. Explorations in the 1910s and 1920s established most of the geography of the region.

The name Karakoram was used in the early 20th century, for example by Kenneth Mason, for the range now known as the Baltoro Muztagh. The term is now used to refer to the entire range from the Batura Muztagh above Hunza in the west to the Saser Muztagh in the bend of the Shyok River in the east.
Floral surveys were carried out in the Shyok River catchment and from Panamik to Turtuk village by Chandra Prakash Kala during 1999 and 2000.

== Geology and glaciers ==

The Karakoram is in one of the world&#x27;s most geologically active areas, at the plate boundary between the Indo-Australian plate and the Eurasian plate.
A significant part, somewhere between 28 and 50 percent, of the Karakoram Range is glaciated covering an area of more than , compared to between 8 and 12 percent of the Himalaya and 2.2 percent of the Alps. Mountain glaciers may serve as an indicator of climate change, advancing and receding with long-term changes in temperature and precipitation. The Karakoram glaciers are slightly retreating, unlike the Himalayas where glaciers are losing mass at significantly higher rate, many Karakoram glaciers are covered in a layer of rubble which insulates the ice from the warmth of the sun. Where there is no such insulation, the rate of retreat is high.

* Siachen Glacier
* Baltoro Glacier
* Hispar Glacier
* Batura Glacier
* Biafo Glacier
* Chogo Lungma Glacier
* Yinsugaiti Glacier

=== Ice Age ===
In the last ice age, a connected series of glaciers stretched from western Tibet to Nanga Parbat, and from the Tarim basin to the Gilgit District. To the south, the Indus glacier was the main valley glacier, which flowed down from Nanga Parbat massif to elevation. In the north, the Karakoram glaciers joined those from the Kunlun Mountains and flowed down to in the Tarim basin.

While the current valley glaciers in the Karakoram reach a maximum length of , several of the ice-age valley glacier branches and main valley glaciers, had lengths up to . During the Ice Age, the glacier snowline was about lower than today.

== Highest peaks ==
Here is a list for the highest peaks of the Karakoram. Included are some of the mountains named with a K code, the most famous of which is the K2 (mountain).

The majority of the highest peaks are in the Gilgit–Baltistan region administered by Pakistan. Baltistan has more than 100 mountain peaks exceeding height from sea level.

== Subranges ==

The naming and division of the various subranges of the Karakoram is not universally agreed upon. However, the following is a list of the most important subranges, following Jerzy Wala. The ranges are listed roughly west to east.

* Batura Muztagh
* Rakaposhi-Haramosh Mountains
* Spantik-Sosbun Mountains
* Hispar Muztagh
* South Ghujerab Mountains
* Panmah Muztagh
* Wesm Mountains
* Masherbrum Mountains
* Baltoro Muztagh
* Saltoro Mountains
* Siachen Muztagh
* Rimo Muztagh
* Saser Muztagh

== Passes ==

Passes from west to east are:
* Dandala Pass is the most important and earlier pass. It starts from Ghursay saitang city to Yarqand in China. It is the main trade route between Khaplu, Ladakh, Kharmang to Yarqand, China.
* Kilik Pass
* Mintaka Pass
* Khunjerab Pass is the highest paved international border crossing at . It serves the China-Pakistan Friendship Highway, the &quot;8th world wonder&quot;.
* Shimshal Pass
* Mustagh Pass
* Karakoram Pass
* Sasser Pass
* Naltar Pass or Pakora Pass

The Khunjerab Pass is the only motorable pass across the range. The Shimshal Pass (which does not cross an international border) is the only other pass still in regular use.

== Cultural references ==
The Karakoram mountain range has been referred to in a number of novels and movies. Rudyard Kipling refers to the Karakoram mountain range in his novel &quot;Kim&quot;, which was first published in 1900. Marcel Ichac made a film titled &quot;Karakoram&quot;, chronicling a French expedition to the range in 1936. The film won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival of 1937. Greg Mortenson details the Karakoram, and specifically K2 and the Balti, extensively in his book &quot;Three Cups of Tea&quot;, about his quest to build schools for children in the region. &quot;K2 Kahani&quot; (The K2 Story) by Mustansar Hussain Tarar describes his experiences at K2 base camp.

<doc id="219682" wikidata="Q547407" url="?curid=219682" title="Good Friday prayer for the Jews">
<text>The Good Friday prayer for the Jews is an annual prayer in some Christian liturgies. It is one of several petitions, known in the Catholic Church as the Solemn Intercessions and in the Episcopal Church (United States) as the Solemn Collects, that are made in the Good Friday service for various classes and stations of peoples: for the Church; for the pope; for bishops, priests and deacons; for the faithful; for catechumens; for other Christians; for the Jews; for others who do not believe in Christ; for those who do not believe in God; for those in public office; and for those in special need. These prayers are ancient, predating the eighth century at least, as they are found in the Gelasian Sacramentary.

== Roman Catholicism ==
===Background===
In medieval Europe, Good Friday and Easter week generally was a time of dread for Jews who often came under attack. The extent to which the language used in the Good Friday prayers contributed to this is a matter of dispute.

In 1926, the Clerical Association of Friends of Israel, a Catholic organization founded to foster positive attitudes toward Jews and to pray for their conversion to Christianity, requested that the phrase &quot;perfidious Jews&quot; (; ) be removed from the liturgy. Pope Pius XI was reportedly strongly in favour of the change and asked the Congregation of Rites to review the matter. Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, who was among the Friends of Israel, was appointed to monitor this issue. The Roman Curia, however, reacted very negatively to the proposal warning that any change to the liturgy would invite other such proposals. Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val, head of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, wrote:

The Holy Office dissolved the association on 25 March 1928.

===Changes by Pius XII===
After World War II, Eugenio Zolli, the former Chief Rabbi of Rome and a convert to Roman Catholicism, asked Pope Pius XII to excise the adjective from the prayer for the Jews. Professor Jules Isaac, a French scholar of Catholic-Jewish relations, did so as well in an audience with Pius in 1949. Pius responded with a public declaration that the Latin word means &#x27;unbelieving&#x27;, not &#x27;perfidious&#x27; or &#x27;treacherous&#x27;. Pope John XXIII later made that change official.

The form used before 1955 read as follows:

At that time, the congregants did not kneel during the prayer for the conversion of the Jews as they did for all of the other petitions in the Good Friday rite. The rationale is a matter of dispute. Liturgist Dom Prosper Guéranger, O.S.B., wrote:

The Russian-Jewish historian Solomon Lurie, on the other hand, wrote in his 1922 book on antisemitism in antiquity that this explanation was arbitrary and &quot;ad hoc&quot; invented since according to the gospels, it was the Roman soldiers, not the Jews, who mocked Christ. Lurie quotes Kane who wrote that &quot;all authors tried to justify the practice that had existed before them, not to introduce the new one. Apparently this practice (of not kneeling) had been established as a result of the populist antisemitism.&quot; The French historian Pierre Pierrard recalled being struck in his youth by this failure to kneel as a lesson in antisemitism, as the Jews were consigned to a &quot;moral ghetto&quot;.

As part of his major revision of the Holy Week liturgy in 1955, Pope Pius XII instituted kneeling for this petition as at the other petitions of the litany, so that the prayer read:

===Changes by John XXIII===
On 21 March 1959, Pope John XXIII ordered that the word &quot;faithless&quot; () be removed from the prayer for the conversion of the Jews. This word had caused much trouble because of misconceptions that the Latin was equivalent to &quot;&quot;, giving birth to the view that the prayer accused the Jews of treachery (perfidy), though the Latin word is more correctly translated as &#x27;faithless&#x27; or &#x27;unbelieving&#x27;. Accordingly, the prayer was revised to read:

John XXIII demonstrated his commitment to the change during the Good Friday service in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in April 1963. When the canon reciting the eight prayers included the word when chanting the Prayer for the Jews, the seventh prayer, the Pope signaled for the liturgy to stop and then had the sequence of prayers repeated from the beginning with the word omitted.

===Changes after Vatican II===
After the Second Vatican Council, the prayer was completely revised for the 1970 edition of the Roman Missal. Because of the possibility of a misinterpretation similar to that of the word , the reference to the veil on the hearts of the Jews, which was based on 2 Corinthians 3:14, was removed. The 1973 ICEL English translation of the revised prayer, which was to be retained in the rejected 1998 version, is as follows:

===Changes by Benedict XVI===
On 7 July 2007, the Vatican released Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s entitled, which permitted more widespread celebration of Mass according to the &quot;Missal promulgated by Pope John XXIII in 1962&quot;. The universal permission given to priests by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 to use the 1962 Roman Missal both privately and, under certain conditions, with a congregation was followed by complaints from Jewish groups and some Catholic leaders over what they perceived as a return to a supersessionist theology that they saw expressed in the 1960 prayer. In response to the complaints, Pope Benedict amended the Good Friday prayer. On 6 February 2008, the Vatican newspaper, , published a note of the Secretariat of State announcing that Pope Benedict XVI had amended the Good Friday prayer for the Jews contained in the 1962 Roman Missal, and decreeing that the amended text &quot;be used, beginning from the current year, in all celebrations of the Liturgy of Good Friday according to the aforementioned &quot;.

The new prayer reads as follows:

Even the new formulation met with reservations from groups such as the Anti-Defamation League. They considered the removal of &quot;blindness&quot; and &quot;immersion in darkness&quot; with respect to the Jews an improvement over the original language in the Tridentine Mass, but saw no reason why the prayer in the rite as revised by Paul VI was not used instead.

===Renewed debate===
Jewish reactions to Benedict&#x27;s authorization underlined their concern that the traditional formulation, which Jews felt offensive, would be more broadly used.

In the form in which they appear in the 1962 Missal, the set of prayers in which that of the Jews is included are for: the Holy Church, the Supreme Pontiff; all orders and grades of the faithful (clergy and laity); public officials (added in 1955, replacing an older prayer for the Holy Roman Emperor, not used since the abdication of Francis II in 1806 but still printed in the Roman Missal); catechumens; the needs of the faithful; heretics and schismatics; the conversion of the Jews (without the word ); the conversion of pagans.

In later editions of the Missal, the prayers are for: the Church; the Pope, the clergy and laity of the Church; those preparing for baptism; the unity of Christians, the Jewish people; those who do not believe in Christ; those who do not believe in God; all in public office; those in special need.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) raised concerns about the document because the 1962 text for Good Friday includes the request asking God to &quot;lift the veil&quot; from Jewish hearts and to show mercy &quot;to the Jews also.&quot; The ADL called the motu proprio &quot;a theological setback in the religious life of Catholics and a body blow to Catholic-Jewish relations, after 40 years of progress between the Church and the Jewish people.&quot; Monsignor Dennis Mikulanis, vicar for inter-religious and ecumenical affairs for the Roman Catholic diocese of San Diego, responded to the ADL saying that &quot;the Church has not restored antisemitic language.&quot; Mikulanis said that the ADL jumped the gun by issuing a statement before the official document had been released and not understanding it. Mikulanis stated that the previous &quot;antisemitic wording from the liturgy&quot; had already been removed from this missal. A letter from the Vatican stated, &quot;Several media reports erroneously contend that the letter could in effect reinstate a prayer offensive to Jews from the Good Friday liturgy of the Tridentine Mass, which dates back to 1570.&quot; The Latin Mass before 1959 contained a reference to &quot;the Jews, who do not have the Faith&quot;, which was deleted in 1959 and does not appear in the missal being permitted by .

After having some time to study and its implications for the Jewish point of view, Abraham Foxman, the National Director of the ADL, reiterated its previously-stated position. Foxman wrote, &quot;The wider use of the Latin Mass will make it more difficult to implement the doctrines of Vatican II and Pope John Paul II, and could even set in motion retrograde forces within the church on the subject of the Jews, none of which are in the interest of either the church or the Jewish people.&quot; He goes on to reiterate that the problem lies with a prayer that calls for the conversion of the Jews that &quot;was removed by Paul VI in 1970&quot;.

At the same time, Foxman emphasized that &quot;the Vatican is not an enemy of the Jewish people, nor is Pope Benedict XVI.&quot; Rather, he wrote, &quot;the current controversy speaks to the need for direct and honest communication based on the friendly relations that have evolved. The church must be true to itself and its teachings, and it must understand that reintroducing this prayer – it was removed by Paul VI in 1970 and replaced with a positive one recognizing the Jews&#x27; eternal covenant with God – will play into the hands of those who are against better relations between Jews and Catholics.&quot;

Although the 1962 version does not include the phrase deemed most offensive (), it is still criticized by some as a prayer that explicitly asks for the conversion of Jews to the Catholic faith of Christ.

Cardinal Avery Dulles responded that the church has a &quot;God-given responsibility to proclaim Christ to all the world. Peter on Pentecost Sunday declared that the whole house of Israel should know for certain that Jesus is Lord and Messiah and that every one of his hearers should be baptized in Jesus&#x27; name (Acts 2:38). Paul spent much of his ministry proclaiming the gospel to Jews throughout the diaspora. Distressed by their incredulity, he was prepared to wish himself accursed for the sake of their conversion ( 9:3).&quot;

The tradition of praying for various groups and purposes dates back to the Early Church (1 Timothy 2:1–5). Roman Catholics believe that on Good Friday in particular, they must acknowledge their common fallen nature, and that Jesus died for all (1 John 2:2). Catholics have long prayed for many classes of people, both inside and outside the church: for the church as a whole, for the Pope, for the hierarchy and the people (regular and lay), for the Emperor, for catechumens, for various needs, for heretics, for achismatics, for the Jews, and for pagans, wishing that all be called to conversion.

Given that, according to the rubrics of both the 1962 and the 1970 Missals, there can be only one celebration of the Good Friday liturgy in each church, the ordinary form of the Roman Rite (i.e. the post-1970 form, which omits the images of the veil and of blindness) is the one to be used almost everywhere.

Some have argued that the Good Friday prayers are liturgically similar to the Jewish prayers or the Aleinu or the Hagaddah, although this is controversial.

The American Jewish Committee (AJC), on the other hand, expressed &quot;its appreciation to Pope Benedict XVI for his confirmation that the positive changes of Vatican II will apply to his recent decision regarding the Latin Mass, which has been reinstated by the Church&quot;. Rabbi David Rosen, the AJC&#x27;s international director of Interreligious Affairs stated: &quot;We acknowledge that the Church&#x27;s liturgy is an internal Catholic matter and this motu proprio from Pope Benedict XVI is based on the permission given by John Paul II in 1988 and thus, on principle, is nothing new&quot;. The statement by the committee, after acknowledging the said quote from its president, affirmed: &quot;However we are naturally concerned about how wider use of this Tridentine liturgy may impact upon how Jews are perceived and treated. Pope Benedict XVI, in a decree issued on Saturday, authorized wider use of the traditional Latin Mass, which in some liturgy contains language offensive to Jews. We appreciate that the motu proprio actually limits the use of the Latin Mass in the days prior to Easter, which addresses the reference in the Good Friday liturgy concerning the Jews[...] However, it is still not clear that this qualification applies to all situations and we have called on the Vatican to contradict the negative implications that some in the Jewish community and beyond have drawn concerning the motu proprio.&quot;

In the May/June 2007 issue of its newsletter, the Committee on the Liturgy of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) published an unofficial English translation of and its cover letter, together with commentary in the form of footnotes and 20 questions and answers. Answer 14 addresses the question of anti-Semitism:

Throughout his papacy, John Paul II worked to reconcile the Church with the Jewish people and to strengthen new bonds of friendship. In 1988, Pope John Paul II gave permission for the Mass to be celebrated according to the of 1962 only as a pastoral provision to assist Catholics who remained attached to the previous rites, thereby hoping to develop closer bonds with the family of the Church.

In 2007 Pope Benedict XVI extended such permission for wider pastoral application, but he remained committed to &quot;the need to overcome past prejudices, misunderstandings, indifference and the language of contempt and hostility [and to continue] the Jewish-Christian dialogue…to enrich and deepen the bonds of friendship which have developed&quot;.

===2011 prayer (Ordinary Form)===
As part of the ICEL English translation of the third edition of the &quot;Roman Missal&quot;, the 1970 prayer was retranslated as follows:
Since 2011, this version of the prayer is the only English version authorized for use in the ordinary form of the Roman Rite.

==Eastern Churches==
In 2007, a group of twelve Eastern Orthodox priests representing five different national churches, some in open defiance of directives from their church leadership, issued a ten-page declaration calling for the removal all liturgical passages they considered anti-Semitic.

==Anglican Communion==
The third of the Solemn Collects in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of the Church of England is as follows:

Canon XIV of the Anglican Church of Canada provides for the deletion of this collect in the Canadian prayerbook. The 1928 revision of the prayer book of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America replaced &quot;all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics&quot; with &quot;all who know thee not as thou art revealed in the Gospel of thy Son.&quot;

The 1979 edition contains this prayer:

<text>An appeal to [[pity]] (also called argumentum ad misericordiam, the sob story, or the [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] argument) is a fallacy in which someone tries to win support for an argument or idea by exploiting one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s feelings of pity or guilt.

<doc id="219685" wikidata="Q30617" url="?curid=219685" title="Cartago, Costa Rica">
<text>Cartago () is the head city of Cartago canton of the Cartago Province, and is composed of the Oriental and Occidental districts as stated in the administrative divisions of Costa Rica. It was the capital of Costa Rica from 1574 to 1824. 

==History==
Founded in 1563 by Juan Vasquez de Coronado, it was the first successful establishment in Costa Rica. The city was granted a coat of arms by King Philip II of Spain in 1565, and the title of Muy Noble y Muy Leal (&quot;Very Noble and Very Loyal&quot;) by the Cortes (Spanish Parliament) in 1814. It served as the first capital of Costa Rica until 1823, when Republican leader Gregorio José Ramírez, moved the capital to the bigger city of San José, because Cartago wanted to unite the newly independent province of Costa Rica to the Iturbide&#x27;s Mexican Empire while San Jose and Alajuela supported a Republican system.

The city was severely damaged by major earthquakes in 1822, 1841 and 1910. In 1963, a volcanic eruption of Irazu Volcano which for two years covered San José in ash badly damaged some agricultural areas around Cartago, but not the city.

Many pilgrims come to Cartago annually, to visit the nation&#x27;s principal church, the enormous Basílica de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles, on the feast day of the Virgin of the Angels (August 2). The church has a statue of a Black Madonna known as La Negrita, who supposedly had great healing powers. The sick come to her statue in hope of a miracle from La Negrita.

According to folklore in Costa Rica, the statue was found by an indigenous girl in 1635. But, in reality, the only inhabitants were black and mulatto slaves who lived in a village named La Puebla, away from the white masters in Cartago. The legend says that she brought the statue home several times, but it mysteriously reappeared at its original site. The rock where she found it is now kept in a backroom in the basilica and is revered as a sacred relic and object of inspiration. The rock is supposed to be in the same location it was when La Negrita was found, but it has been moved as the basilica was rebuilt (see below). It is common for pilgrims to touch the rock in reverence.

The Plaza Mayor in Cartago includes the Santiago Apóstol Parish Ruins, about seven blocks west from the basilica. Despite their beauty, they are not real ruins but an unfinished building, which was badly damaged by the 1910 earthquake and then interrupted. The city&#x27;s government is declaring 100 blocks as Cartago&#x27;s &quot;historical center.&quot; This is a way to keep the historical buildings alive in the future, as many cities in the world have done. On the other hand, the government of the city and JASEC (the company that produces and distributes electricity to Cartago and surrounding areas) have been working to light some of the most important historical buildings as a way to attract inhabitants and tourists to the city at night time.

On April 24, 2010 the former &quot;Cuartel de la Ciudad&quot;, home of the local police, finally opened after a two-year restoration as the new City Museum. It is located 2 blocks north of the Plaza Mayor.

The Chilean biochemist and biophysicist Jorge Allende was born in Cartago in 1934.


==Economy==
Agricultural products make up the base of the economy of the rural areas around the city. There is an industrial park where a few Costa Rican and international companies are located. However, a large portion of the locals do not work in the city itself but in San José metropolitan area. Those who do work within the city limits concentrate largely in the service and commerce sectors of the economy.

Cartago is home of the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC), one of the most prestigious higher education institutions in the country and one of Central America&#x27;s most important engineering schools. It is located in Dulce Nombre district, not far from Los Angeles Basilica.

==Tourism==
Places tourists often visit in the city include the Basilica of Los Angeles, the &quot;Ruins of Santiago Apostle Church&quot;, The City Museum, Maria Auxiliadora church, the Costa Rica Institute of Technology, The Central Market (especially on Thursdays and Saturdays), and the main building of San Luis Gonzaga High School, site of the first Central American Supreme Court. Cultural activities take place at the &quot;Casa de la Ciudad&quot; and the &quot;Casa de la Cultura&quot;, as well as in the campus of the Costa Rica Institute of Technology.

The province is known for its rich ecological diversity and dense tropical rainforests along the mountain ranges near the Irazu and Turrialba volcanoes.

==Sports==
The city&#x27;s football club is Cartaginés, who have won the Costa Rican league four times. They play their home games at the Estadio José Rafael Fello Meza Ivankovich.

==Geography==
It has an elevation of above sea level, at the base of the Irazú Volcano.

==Climate==
Cartago has a borderline tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) and dry winter subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;). Coinciding with the tropical monsoon classification, it has noticeably cooler weather than most places of this climate type, owing to its high elevation. It has steadily very warm temperatures throughout the year, with heavy rainfall in most months and a short dry season in the winter.

<text>Robert S. Garrett (May 24, 1875 – April 25, 1961) was an American athlete, as well as investment banker and philanthropist in Baltimore, Maryland and financier of several important archeological excavations. Garrett was the first modern Olympic champion in discus throw as well as shot put.

==Early and family life==

Robert S. Garrett was born in then rural/suburban Baltimore County, Maryland (which surrounds the City of Baltimore) into one of Maryland&#x27;s most prominent and wealthy families. For four generations, the Garretts ran Robert Garrett and Sons, a shipping and financing, investment banking firm founded by his Irish immigrant great-grandfather, also named Robert Garrett, in 1819. His grandfather John Work Garrett (1820–1884) had led the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (the first passenger railroad line established in America, 1827–1828), for nearly three decades (1858–1884), including supporting the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865), making it by the middle of the 19th century as one of the most important lines in the nation, and also became an important philanthropist in Baltimore. His father was Thomas Harrison Garrett (1849–1888),&lt;ref name=&quot;pmc/meG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother the former Alice Dickerson Whitridge (1851–1920); his elder brother John Work Garrett (1872–1942) became a distinguished American diplomat for the United States Department of State.

Like his elder brother, Robert S. Garrett studied at Princeton University, in Princeton, New Jersey, where he excelled in track and field athletics as an undergraduate, and captained Princeton&#x27;s track team in both his junior and senior years. Garrett married Katharine Barker Johnson (1885–1961), who survived him by less than a year. They had two sons and three daughters by 1920. Although their first daughter and son both died as infants, and their youngest son, a United States Army Air Corps pilot Lt. John Work Garrett (1924–1944) died during World War II (1939/1941–1945), and sons Harrison Garrett (1911–1994) and Johnson Garrett (1912–1979) survived their parents, as did daughters Katharine Garrett Bainbridge (1914–1999) and Ella Brock Johnson Garrett Brigham (1917–2006).

==Athletic career==
As an undergraduate, Garrett was primarily a shot-putter, though he also competed in the jumping events. When he decided to compete in the famous first modern Olympic games (First Olympiad) being revived and held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, Professor William Milligan Sloane suggested that Garrett also try the discus. They consulted classical authorities to develop a drawing and Garrett hired a blacksmith to make a discus. It weighed nearly 30 pounds (14 kg) and was impossible to throw any distance, so he gave up on the idea. Garrett paid for his own and three classmates&#x27; travel to Athens to compete in the games. Francis Lane would finish third in 100 m, Herbert Jamison finished second in 400 m, and Albert Tyler placed second in pole vault. When Garrett discovered that a real discus weighed less than , he decided to enter the event for fun.

===1896 First Olympics===
The three Greek discus throwers among the eleven men entered in the event were true stylists. Each throw, as they spun and rose from a classical Discobolus stance, was intended to be beautiful. Garrett threw the discus with tremendous force using a style more similar to the hammer throw, after seizing the discus in his right hand and swinging himself around and around. Garrett&#x27;s first two throws were clumsy. Instead of sailing parallel to the ground, the discus turned over and over and narrowly missed hitting audience members. Both foreigners and Americans laughed at his efforts, and Garrett joined in the general merriment. His final throw, however, punctuated with a loud grunt, sent the discus sailing beyond the second-place throw (by Panagiotis Paraskevopoulos) mark at .

American spectator Burton Holmes wrote: &quot;All were stupefied. The Greeks had been defeated at their own classic exercise. They were overwhelmed by the superior skill and daring of the Americans, to whom they ascribed a supernatural invincibility enabling them to dispense with training and to win at games which they had never before seen.&quot; According to James Connolly, the winning Americans in five of the track and field events had not had a single day of outdoor practice since the previous fall.

Garrett also won the shot put with a distance of and finished second in the high jump (tied equally with James Connolly at ) and second in the long jump (with a jump of ).

===1900 Second Olympics===
In the subsequent 1900 Olympics four years later, Garrett competed again and placed third in the shot put and the standing triple jump. His bronze medal in the shot put was unusual, as he refused to compete in the final because it was on a Sunday, his religious day of rest. However, his qualifying mark was good enough to place Garrett in third place. He also competed in the discus throw again, but due to a poorly planned course was unable to set a legal mark as all of his discus throws hit trees.

Garrett was also a member of the Tug-of-War team at the 1900 Olympics that was forced to withdraw because three of the six members were engaged in the hammer throw final.

==Baltimore banker and civic leader==
Garrett later became a banker and financier at his grandfather&#x27;s historic mercantile firm, Robert Garrett and Sons, at their landmark office building on the southwest corner of South and Water Streets in downtown Baltimore. He was an investor in the B&amp;O Railroad.

===Archeology and manuscripts===

Garrett had an early intensive interest in science, especially in history and archeology, and became an early collector and important donor. He helped to organize and finance an archaeological expedition to Syria, led by Dr. John M. T. Finney. From 1932 to 1939, he was involved with the Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity both helping to fund the excavations and working on them. Garrett&#x27;s hobby was collecting medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. Garrett amassed a collection of historical volumes of Western and non-Western manuscripts, fragments, and scrolls, originating from Europe, the Near East, Africa, Asia and Mesoamerica, ca. 1340 B.C. – A.D. 1900s. He inherited his collecting interest from his father, Thomas Harrison Garrett. After his father&#x27;s sudden death in 1888, Robert spent the following two and a half years traveling extensively with his mother and two brothers, Horatio and John, in Europe and the Near East. During his travels Garrett developed a particular interest in manuscripts and began collecting. He used the text Universal Paleography: or, Facsimiles of Writing of All Nations and Periods by J. B. Silvester (by Sir Frederic Madden, London, 1949–50) as his guide for collecting primary examples of every known type of script.

Garrett was for many years an enthusiastic alumnus and served as trustee of Princeton University and also on the governing board of the Baltimore Museum of Art, founded in 1914 by his aunt Mary Elizabeth Garrett, (1857-1915), and working in the relocation and construction project of their new museum building designed by famous American architect John Russell Pope (1874-1937), on Art Museum Drive, off of North Charles Street, and adjacent to the also newly located Homewood Campus of The Johns Hopkins University. In 1942, Garrett donated his collection of more than 11,000 manuscripts to Princeton University, including the &quot;Aksum Scrolls&quot; and sixteen Byzantine Greek manuscripts, containing rare examples of illuminated Byzantine art.

===Baltimore activist===
Through a mayoral appointment, Garrett served as the chairman of the city&#x27;s Public Improvement Commission. He was also largely responsible for bringing the new Boy Scouts of America youth organization to Baltimore in 1910, shortly after its national establishment and imported from Great Britain with founder. He managed the BSA in Baltimore until his retirement in 1934. In 1919, Garrett gave to the City of Baltimore a tract of land of a city block along East Patapsco Avenue, between Second and Third Streets in its recently annexed Brooklyn neighborhood in South Baltimore to be used as a public park, which was named in his honor.

Garrett helped develop Baltimore&#x27;s public recreational facilities, many of which were privately funded by himself, colleagues and friends. Garrett organized the Public Athletic League which later merged with a similar earlier Children&#x27;s Playground Association. He was the first chairman of Baltimore City&#x27;s Bureau of Recreation, and the first chairman of the city&#x27;s Board of Park Commissioners for the combined Department of Recreation and Parks. Garrett was through much of his life an active member of the National Recreation Association, and was elected its chairman in 1941.

In the Baltimore mayoral campaign of 1947, both the Republican and Democratic nominees promised that, if elected, they would name Garrett as chairman of the city&#x27;s Department of Recreation and Parks. A devout Presbyterian throughout his life, he was a member of their national convention - the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, and was recognized in 1948 as the year&#x27;s outstanding layperson in the field of religious education by the International Council of Religious Education.

In the realm of civil rights for African-Americans, Garrett was a staunch conservative and opposed any racial integration of the city&#x27;s public facilities in its parks, playgrounds, swimming pools, tennis courts and recreation centers. Controversies increased as the national civil rights movement expanded in the late 1940s and 1950s. Garrett was later asked to resign from the Board of Park Commissioners when a positive vote for integration was taken.

==Death and legacy==

Garrett died on April 25, 1961, in Baltimore, Maryland and was buried with other family members at Baltimore&#x27;s historic Green Mount Cemetery, where his widow would also be buried by year&#x27;s end. As noted above, the Garrett Park recreation area in Baltimore City&#x27;s Brooklyn neighborhood, on East Patapsco Avenue, between Second and Third Streets, was donated and named for him. He donated his papers to Princeton University; the Library of Congress also has family papers

In the 1984 NBC television two-part miniseries, &quot;The First Olympics: Athens 1896&quot;, Garrett was portrayed by actor Hunt Block. In the second episode, Garrett was incorrectly portrayed as being a participant in the first Olympic Marathon.

<text>was a Japanese Grand Prix motorcycle road racer, the 2001 250cc world champion, and the 2000 and 2002 Suzuka 8 Hours winner. He died as a result of injuries sustained after a crash during the 2003 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix at Suzuka Circuit, Japan.

==Career==
Kato was born in Saitama, and started racing miniature bikes at an early age, becoming a four-time national champion in the Japanese pocket-bike championship.

He began road racing in 1992, and entered his first Grand Prix in 1996, as a wild-card rider. In the 250cc class, Kato finished third after debuting at his home circuit of Suzuka Circuit. The next year, he won the Japanese Championship, and again entered the Japanese Grand Prix with a wild card, winning the race at this occasion.
In spite of these successes, Kato did not ride his first full Grand Prix season until 2000, when he started in the 250cc, riding a Honda. He won four races that season (of which two in Japan), and placed third in the championship. He also finished all the races in the 2000 Season In 2001, he dominated the 250cc championship. He won no fewer than 11 races, a record in 250cc and still stands today after the class became Moto2, and easily won the title. In that season he also set a new record for the most points in a single season in 250cc class with 322 points.

The following season, Kato moved up to the MotoGP class (formerly 500cc) racing for Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) in the Fortuna Gresini Racing team. Some strong performances on the Honda NSR500 two-stroke bike in the first half of the season including second place at the 2002 Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix at Jerez circuit, meant he was given a full factory supported four-stroke Honda RC211V for the rest of the season; his best result on the Honda RC211V was a second place at the Czech Grand Prix at Brno. He also took pole at his home race at Twin Ring Motegi.

For 2003, Kato remained at the Gresini Racing team, now with sponsorship from Telefónica Movistar brought by new teammate Sete Gibernau joining from Suzuki.

===Death===

On 6 April 2003, during the first race of the MotoGP season at the Japanese Grand Prix held at the Suzuka Circuit, Kato crashed hard and sustained severe head, neck and chest injuries. He hit the wall near the Casio Triangle chicane of the circuit at around 125 mph (200 km/h).

The Accident Investigation Committee determined that Kato crashed when he lost control of his motorcycle, which entered a near high-side state, followed by an uncontrollable oscillating weave resulting in his leaving the track and striking the barrier. Initially he and the bike struck a tire barrier, followed by a foam barrier. There was a gap between the tire and foam barriers, and Kato was severely injured when his head struck the edge of the foam barrier, dislocating the joint between the base of the skull and the cervical spine.

Questions were raised regarding the actions of the corner workers immediately following the crash. Kato was thrown back onto the track after hitting the barriers and was lying next to the racing line. Depending on the type of race (endurance or standard), when a motorcycle or rider is incapacitated on the race track, a red flag is waved and the race stopped, or in endurance races and British Superbike Championship events, the safety car is called on the circuit to neutralise the race so the motorcycles are packed-up behind the said vehicle at slow speeds, so the track can be safely cleared. This did not happen following Kato&#x27;s accident. Instead, the corner workers moved him onto a stretcher and off the circuit. The race was not stopped. Kato&#x27;s crash was the first fatal accident to occur during a Grand Prix motorcycle racing race session at Suzuka Circuit; his was the last motorsport fatal crash at the circuit until Jules Bianchi at the 2014 Formula One Japanese Grand Prix. 

The Investigation Committee noted: &quot;According to images broadcast during the race, four rescue workers took hold of Kato, who lay collapsed face up in the middle of the course, held him by the right shoulder, the torso and both legs, and moved him sideways just a few dozen centimeters onto the stretcher. It certainly appears that sufficient care was taken to immobilize his head and neck area. However, when the stretcher was moved Kato&#x27;s head drooped markedly, and it cannot be denied that this might have additionally injured his neck.&quot;

Kato spent two weeks in a coma following the accident before dying as a result of the injuries he sustained. The cause of death was listed as brain stem infarction. Many of the MotoGP riders wore black armbands or placed small #74&#x27;s on their leathers and bikes at the following race in South Africa to pay tribute to the fallen racer. His teammate, Sete Gibernau, thereafter wore a #74 on his racing suit since winning the race in his memory. There has not been a Grand Prix motorcycle race held at Suzuka following Kato&#x27;s crash, with safety issues at the facility being cited as the reason.

During the 2003 Suzuka 8 Hours race held that July, Honda paid tribute to Kato, a two-time Suzuka winner, by bearing his racing number on the Sakurai Honda bike of Tadayuki Okada and Chojun Kameya (who in Turn 1 crashed on spilt oil on the second lap), along with the bikes of Nicky Hayden and Atsushi Watanabe. Once Okada and the others returned to the pits with their broken bikes, Okada was permitted to go back out with a spare bike, as a mark of respect, but was ineligible to win since his original bike was badly damaged. Two hours later, he returned to the pitlane to retire the bike amid mass applause from the crowd. At the end of the race, the other Sakurai bikes of Yukio Nukumi and Manabu Kamada (who were still racing), went on to the rostrum to show off Kato&#x27;s helmet bearing his number on the visor, and a photo of him on the bike, as a mark of respect.

Afterwards the FIM retired Kato&#x27;s number, and the bike number 74 has not been used by any rider since. The FIM named him a Grand Prix &quot;Legend&quot;. Satoshi Motoyama, a fellow Japanese racer driving in the Super GT and a childhood friend of Kato had the latter&#x27;s racing number on his helmet ever since Kato&#x27;s death.

===Tributes===
A month after the crash, on 18 May Honda organised a day whereupon 9,000 people including his last team owner, Fausto Gresini, attended their Aoyama building in Tokyo, where a shrine with exhibits to &quot;Daiji-chan&quot; had been created. Then British American Racing Formula One driver Takuma Sato led a tribute by expressing his condolences of the death to his friend Daijiro Kato during 2003 San Marino Grand Prix weekend as a test driver.

In 2006, the Misano World Circuit honoured Kato, who lived part of the season in the area, by naming a new access road to the circuit &quot;Via Daijiro Kato&quot;. That circuit&#x27;s offices are located on the road named in his memory.

<text>Ellery Harding Clark (March 13, 1874 – July 27, 1949) was an American track and field athlete and a writer. He was the first modern Olympic champion in high jump and long jump.

==Biography==
Clark is the only person to have won both the Olympic high jump and long jump. Clark achieved it in 1896, at the first modern Olympics in Athens. A Harvard student, he was given a leave of absence to compete because of his high grades - in contrast to another gold medal winner from Harvard, James Connolly. Clark was one of the top all-around athletes from 1893 to 1912.

In the long jump, Clark had used his hat to mark his runway. Twice the judge (King Constantine of Greece) had removed the hat, saying this was a practice of professionals. Only at the third attempt, and without the hat, did Clark achieve a valid jump, good enough for gold. His final jump was of 6.35 meters. Clark later won the high jump as well, clearing 1.81 meters. The closest competitors were fellow Americans Connolly and Robert Garrett at 1.65 meters. In the shot put, Clark was among the bottom three of the seven-man field.

He never won a national championship in either jump, but he was the 1897 and 1903 AAU champion in the all-around, an event similar to the decathlon. He won the 1897 American all-around championship with performances that would have won him the 1896 Olympic high jump, long jump, and shot put, and probably the 100 metres and the 110 metres hurdles as well.

Ellery also competed in the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, in the all-around competition. Although he had to abandon the contest after five events due to bronchitis, he was still classed sixth. At age 32, he was still winning major meets. He competed as a walker until the age of 56.

Clark&#x27;s professional life was equally varied. He excelled as an author, lawyer, track coach, teacher and Boston city alderman. He wrote 19 books including one which was made into a 1952 film, &quot;Caribbean&quot;.

In 1904 he married Mary Victoria Maddelena, a Swiss. The engagement and subsequent marriage caused something of a stir in the press - Clark was a millionaire and Maddalena was from the &#x27;South end slums&#x27;.

In 1949, he died at the age 75 on a train en route from Boston to his home at Cohasset.

Clark was inducted into the USATF Hall of Fame in 1991.

<doc id="219709" wikidata="Q3048" url="?curid=219709" title="Charles Maurras">
<text>Charles-Marie-Photius Maurras (; ; 20 April 1868 – 16 November 1952) was a French author, politician, poet, and critic. He was an organizer and principal philosopher of &quot;Action Française&quot;, a political movement that is monarchist, anti-parliamentarist, and counter-revolutionary. Maurras also held anti-communist, anti-Masonic, anti-Protestant, and antisemitic views, while being highly critical of Nazism, referring to it as &quot;stupidity&quot;. His ideas greatly influenced National Catholicism and integral nationalism, led by his tenet that &quot;a true nationalist places his country above everything&quot;.

Raised Catholic, Maurras went deaf and became an agnostic in his youth, but remained anti-secularist and politically supportive of the Church. An Orléanist, he began his career by writing literary criticism and became politically active as a leading anti-Dreyfusard. In 1926, Pope Pius XI issued a controversial papal condemnation of &quot;Action Française&quot;, which was repealed by Pope Pius XII in 1939.

In 1936, after voicing death threats against the socialist politician Léon Blum, Maurras was sentenced to eight months in La Santé. While imprisoned, he received the support of Marie-Pauline Martin, Henry Bordeaux, Pius XI, and up to 60,000 sympathetic citizens. During World War II, Maurras supported the Nazi-collaborationist Vichy regime, believing that Free France was being manipulated by the Soviet Union. He wrote many anti-Semitic articles during this time, although he opposed Vichy&#x27;s deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps. He explained his support for Vichy, writing: &quot;As a royalist I never lost sight of the necessity of monarchy. But to enthrone the royal heir, the heritage had to be saved.&quot; After the regime&#x27;s collapse, he was arrested and accused of complicity with the enemy. Following a political trial, he was convicted of incitement to murder, receiving &quot;Indignité nationale&quot; and a life sentence. In 1951, after falling ill, he was transferred to a hospital and later received a medical pardon. In his final days, he reverted to Catholicism and received the last rites shortly before his death.

As a political theorist and major right-wing intellectual of 20th-century Europe, Maurras significantly influenced right-wing and far-right ideologies, anticipating some of the ideas of fascism. He has been described as the most important French conservative intellectual, and has directly influenced a large number of politicians, theorists, and writers on both the left and right, including Eliot, Hulme, Douglas, Evola, Schmitt, Heidegger, Bernanos, Mauriac, Thibon, Sorel, Déon, Laurent, Henri of Orléans, Kuehnelt-Leddihn, Maritain, de Oliveira, Sardinha, Pereyra, Althusser, Osma, Lanz, de Gaulle, Franco, Salazar, Duplessis, Coughlin, Degrelle, Pétain, Perón, Ferrara, Bannon, and Macron. To this day, Maurras remains controversial. Critics have attacked his anti-Semitic views and support of Vichy, calling him a &quot;fascist icon&quot;. Conversely, supporters like Georges Pompidou have praised him as a prophet. Others, including Macron, have taken a nuanced approach, with Macron stating: &quot;I fight all the antisemitic ideas of Maurras, but I find it absurd to say that Maurras must no longer exist.&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Before World War I ===

Maurras was born into a Provençal family, brought up by his mother and grandmother in a Catholic and monarchist environment. In his early teens, he became deaf. Like many other French politicians, he was affected greatly by France&#x27;s defeat in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. After the 1871 Commune of Paris and the 1879 defeat of Marshal MacMahon&#x27;s &quot;Moral Order&quot; government, French society slowly found a consensus for the Republic, symbolized by the rallying of the monarchist Orleanists to the Republic. Maurras published his first article, at the age of 17 years, in the review &quot;Annales de philosophie chrétienne&quot;. He then collaborated on various reviews, including &quot;L&#x27;Événement&quot;, &quot;La Revue bleue&quot;, &quot;La Gazette de France&quot; and &quot;La Revue encyclopédique&quot;, in which he praised Classicism and attacked Romanticism.

At some point during his youth, Maurras lost his Catholic faith and became an agnostic. In 1887, at the age of seventeen, he came to Paris and began writing literary criticism in the Catholic and Orleanist &quot;Observateur&quot;. At this time, Maurras was influenced by Orleanism, as well as German philosophy reviewed by Catholic thinker Léon Ollé-Laprune, an influence of Henri Bergson, and by the philosopher Maurice Blondel, one of the inspirations of Christian &quot;modernists&quot;, who would later become his greatest opponents. He became acquainted with the Provençal poet Frédéric Mistral in 1888 and shared the federalist thesis of Mistral&#x27;s Félibrige movement (see Maurras and Félibrige). The same year he met the nationalist writer Maurice Barrès.

In 1890, Maurras approved Cardinal Lavigerie&#x27;s call for the rallying of Catholics to the Republic, thus making his opposition not to the Republic in itself, but to &quot;sectarian Republicanism&quot;.

Beside this Orleanist affiliation, Maurras shared some traits with Bonapartism. In December 1887, he demonstrated to the cry of &quot;Down with the robbers!&quot; during the military decorations trafficking scandal, which had involved Daniel Wilson, the son-in-law of President Jules Grévy. Despite this, he initially opposed the nationalist-populist Boulangist philosophy. But in 1889, after a visit to Maurice Barrès, Barrès voted for the Boulangist candidate; despite his &quot;anti-Semitism of the heart&quot; (&quot;anti-sémitisme de coeur&quot;), he decided to vote for a Jew.

During 1894–1895, Maurras briefly worked for Barrès&#x27; newspaper &quot;La Cocarde&quot; (The Cockade), although he sometimes opposed Barrès&#x27; opinions concerning the French Revolution. &quot;La Cocarde&quot; supported General Boulanger, who had become a threat to the parliamentary Republic in the late 1880s.

During a trip to Athens for the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, Maurras came to criticize the Greek democratic system of the &quot;polis&quot;, which he considered doomed because of its internal divisions and its openness towards &quot;métèques&quot; (foreigners).

====Political involvement====
Maurras became involved in politics at the time of the Dreyfus affair, becoming an Anti-Dreyfusard. He endorsed Colonel Henry&#x27;s forgery blaming Dreyfus, as he considered that defending Dreyfus weakened the Army and the justice system. According to Maurras, Dreyfus was to be sacrificed on the altar of national interest. But while the Republican nationalist thinker Barrès accused Dreyfus of being guilty because of his Jewishness, Maurras went a step further, vilifying the &quot;Jewish Republic&quot;. While Barrès&#x27; anti-Semitism originated both in pseudo-scientific racist contemporary theories and Biblical exegesis, Maurras decried &quot;scientific racism&quot; in favor of a more radical &quot;state anti-Semitism.&quot; 
Maurras assisted with the foundation of the nationalist and anti-Dreyfusard Ligue de la patrie française at the end of 1898, along with Maurice Barrès, the geographer Marcel Dubois, the poet François Coppée and the critic and literature professor Jules Lemaître.

In 1899, Maurras founded the review &quot;Action Française&quot; (AF), an offshoot of the newspaper created by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois the year preceding. Maurras quickly became influential in the movement, and converted Pujo and Vaugeois to monarchism, which became the movement&#x27;s principal cause. With Léon Daudet, he edited the movement&#x27;s review, &quot;La Revue de l&#x27;Action Française&quot;, which during 1908 became a daily newspaper with the shorter title &quot;L&#x27;Action Française&quot;. The AF mixed integral nationalism with reactionary themes, shifting the nationalist ideology, previously supported by left-wing Republicans, to the political right. It had a wide readership during the implementation of the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State. In 1899 he wrote a short notice in favour of monarchy, &quot;Dictateur et roi&quot; (&quot;Dictator and King&quot;), and then in 1900 his &quot;Enquête sur la monarchie&quot; (&quot;Investigations on Monarchy&quot;), published in the Legitimist mouthpiece &quot;La Gazette de France&quot;, which made him famous. Maurras also published thirteen articles in the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; during 1901 and 1902, as well as six articles between November 1902 and January 1903 in Edouard Drumont&#x27;s anti-Semitic newspaper, &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;.

Between 1905 and 1908, when the &quot;Camelots du Roi&quot; monarchist league was initiated, Maurras introduced the concept of political activism through extra-parliamentary leagues, theorizing the possibility of a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. 
Maurras also founded the Ligue d&#x27;Action Française in 1905, whose mission was to recruit members for the Action Française. 
Members pledged to fight the republican regime and to support restoration of the monarchy under Prince Philippe, Duke of Orléans (1869–1926).

Many early members of the Action Française were practicing Catholics, including Bernard de Vésins, the art historian Louis Dimier and the essayist Léon de Montesquiou. They helped Maurras develop the royalist league&#x27;s pro-Catholic policies.

=== From World War I to the end of the 1930s ===
Maurras then endorsed France&#x27;s entry into World War I (even to the extent of supporting the thoroughly republican Georges Clemenceau) against the German Empire. During the war, the Jewish businessman Emile Ullman was forced to resign from the board of directors of the Comptoir d&#x27;Escompte bank after Maurras accused him of being a German agent. He then criticized the Treaty of Versailles for not being harsh enough on the Germans and condemned Aristide Briand&#x27;s policy of cooperation with Germany. In 1923, Germaine Berton carried out the assassination of fellow Action Française member Marius Plateau. Berton had planned to also assassinate Léon Daudet and Maurras but was unsuccessful.
In 1925, he called for the murder of Abraham Schrameck, the Interior Minister of Paul Painlevé&#x27;s Cartel des Gauches&#x27;s (left-wing coalition) government, who had ordered the disarming of the far-right leagues. For this death threat, he was sentenced to a fine and a year in jail (suspended). 

In 1929 Pope Pius XI condemned the &quot;Action Française&quot;, which until then was supported by a large number of Catholics, clergy and laity alike. Several of the works of the movement&#x27;s founder Charles Maurras were placed into the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;, alongside the movement&#x27;s official newspaper. This was a devastating blow to the movement. On 8 March 1927, AF members were prohibited from receiving the sacraments. Many of its members left (two Catholics who were forced to look for a different path in politics and life were writers François Mauriac and Georges Bernanos); and it entered a period of decline.

Maurras again voiced death threats against the President of the Council (prime minister) Léon Blum, organizer of the Popular Front, in the &quot;Action Française&quot; of 15 May 1936, emphasizing his Jewish origins (he once called him an &quot;old semitic camel&quot;). This other death threat earned him eight months in prison, from 29 October 1936 to 6 July 1937. Fearing communism, he joined the pacifists and praised the Munich Agreement of 1938, which the President of the Council Édouard Daladier had signed without any illusions. He also wrote in &quot;Action Française&quot;:

During the 1930s – especially after the 6 February 1934 crisis—many of Action Française members turned to fascism, including Robert Brasillach, Lucien Rebatet, Abel Bonnard, Paul Chack, and Claude Jeantet. Most of them belonged to the staff of the fascist newspaper &quot;Je suis partout&quot; (&quot;I am everywhere&quot;).

Influencing António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime in Portugal, Maurras also supported Francisco Franco and, until spring 1939, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist regime. Opposing Adolf Hitler because he was anti-German, Maurras himself criticized the racist policies of Nazism in 1936, and requested a complete translation of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; – some passages had been censored in the French edition.

After his failure against Charles Jonnart in 1924 to be elected to the Académie française, he succeeded in entering the ranks of the &quot;Immortals&quot; on 9 June 1938, replacing Henri-Robert, winning by 20 votes against 12 to Fernand Gregh. He was received in the Academy on 8 June 1939 by Catholic writer Henry Bordeaux. In the same year, Pope Pius XII repealed his predecessor&#x27;s condemnation of the &quot;Action Française&quot;.

=== Vichy regime, arrest and death ===

In June 1940 articles in &quot;Action Française&quot; signed by Maurras, Léon Daudet, and Maurice Pujo praised General Charles de Gaulle. While Maurras described Marshal Philippe Pétain as a &quot;divine surprise&quot;, the statement is usually quoted without context; Maurras was referring specifically to Pétain having political talent as well as being a symbol of France, and there is no evidence of the remark until February 1941.

Vichy France&#x27;s reactionary program of a &quot;Révolution Nationale&quot; (National Revolution) was fully approved of by Maurras, who inspired large parts of it. The monarchist newspaper was forbidden in the Occupied Zone and under Vichy censorship in the Southern Zone from November 1942. In &quot;La Seule France&quot; (1941) Maurras argued for a policy of &quot;France d&#x27;abord&quot; (&quot;France First&quot;), whereby France would restore itself politically and morally under Pétain, resolving what Maurras saw as the causes of France&#x27;s defeat in 1940, before dealing with the issue of the foreign occupation. This position was contrasted to the attitude of the Gaullists, who fled France and continued the military struggle. Maurras savaged the pre-war French governments for taking an increasingly bellicose position vis-à-vis Germany at precisely the same time that these governments were weakening France, militarily, socially and politically, thereby making France&#x27;s defeat during 1940 all but inevitable. Maurras also criticized the 1940 Law on the status of Jews for being too moderate. At the same time, he continued to express elements of his longstanding antipathy towards Germany by arguing in &quot;La Seule France&quot; that Frenchmen must not be drawn to that country&#x27;s model and by hosting anti-German conferences, and he opposed both the &quot;dissidents&quot; in London and the collaborators in Paris and Vichy (such as Lucien Rebatet, Robert Brasillach, Pierre Laval, or Marcel Déat). In 1943, the Germans planned to arrest Maurras.

A pre-war admirer of de Gaulle, who himself had been influenced by Maurras&#x27; integralism, Maurras then harshly criticized the General in exile. He later claimed he believed that Pétain was playing a &quot;double game&quot;, working for an Allied victory in secret.

After the liberation of France, Maurras was arrested in September 1944 together with his right-hand man Maurice Pujo, and indicted before the High Court of Lyon for &quot;complicity with the enemy&quot; on the basis of the articles he had published since the beginning of the war. At the end of the trial, during which there were many irregularities such as false dating or truncated quotations, Maurras was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil liberties. He was automatically dismissed from the Académie française (a measure included in the ordinance of 26 December 1944). His response to his conviction was to exclaim &quot;C&#x27;est la revanche de Dreyfus!&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Dreyfus&#x27;s revenge!&quot;)

According to historian Eugen Weber, the trial against Maurras was political and was rigged against him. Weber writes that the jurors who were chosen for Maurras&#x27; case were taken from a list drawn up by his political enemies.

Meanwhile, the Académie française declared his seat vacant, as it had for Pétain&#x27;s, instead of expelling him as it did for Abel Hermant and Abel Bonnard. (The academy waited until his death to elect his successor, and chose Antoine de Lévis-Mirepoix, who was himself influenced by Action Française and collaborated with Pierre Boutang&#x27;s monarchist review &quot;La Nation Française&quot;.)

After being imprisoned in Riom and then Clairvaux, Maurras was released in March 1952 to be hospitalized. He was supported by Henry Bordeaux, who repeatedly asked the President of the Republic, Vincent Auriol, to pardon Maurras. Although weakened, Maurras collaborated with &quot;Aspects de la France&quot;, which had replaced the outlawed review &quot;Action Française&quot; in 1947. He was transferred to a clinic in Tours, where he died soon afterwards. In his last days he readopted the Catholic faith of his childhood and received the last rites.

== Maurras&#x27; work ==
=== Maurras and Félibrige ===
A Provence-born author, Maurras joined Félibrige, a literary and cultural association founded by Frédéric Mistral and other Provençal writers to defend and promote Occitan languages and literature. The name of the association was derived from &quot;félibre&quot;, a Provençal word meaning pupil or follower.

=== Maurras&#x27; political thought ===
Maurras&#x27; political ideas were based on intense nationalism (what he described as &quot;integral nationalism&quot;) and a belief in an ordered society based on strong government. These were the bases of his endorsement for both a French monarchy and the Roman Catholic Church.

He formulated an aggressive political strategy, which contrasted with the Legitimists&#x27; apathy for political action. He managed to combine the paradox of a reactionary thought which would actively change history, a form of Counter-revolution opposed to simple conservatism. His &quot;integral nationalism&quot; rejected all democratic principles which he judged contrary to &quot;natural inequality&quot;, criticizing all evolution since the 1789 French Revolution, and advocated the return to a hereditary monarchy.

Like many people in Europe at the time, he was haunted by the idea of &quot;decadence&quot;, partly inspired by his reading of the publications of Hippolyte Taine and Ernest Renan, and admired classicism. He felt that France had lost its grandeur during the Revolution of 1789, a grandeur inherited from its origins as a province of the Roman Empire and forged by, as he put it, &quot;forty kings who in a thousand years made France.&quot; The French Revolution, he wrote in the &quot;Observateur Français&quot;, was negative and destructive.

He traced this decline further back, to the Enlightenment and the Reformation; he described the source of the evil as &quot;Swiss ideas&quot;, a reference to the adopted nation of Calvin and the birth nation of Rousseau. Maurras further blamed France&#x27;s decline on &quot;Anti-France&quot;, which he defined as the &quot;four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners&quot; (his actual word for the latter being the xenophobic term &quot;métèques&quot;). Indeed, to him the first three were all &quot;internal foreigners.&quot;

Antisemitism and anti-Protestantism were common themes in his writings. He believed that the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and the eventual outcome of the French Revolution had all contributed to individuals valuing themselves more than the nation, with consequent negative effects on the latter, and that democracy and liberalism were only making matters worse.

Although Maurras advocated the revival of monarchy, in many ways Maurras did not typify the French monarchist tradition. His endorsement of the monarchy and for Catholicism was explicitly pragmatic, as he alleged that a state religion was the only way of maintaining public order. By contrast with Maurice Barrès, a theorist of a kind of Romantic nationalism based on the Ego, Maurras claimed to base his opinions on reason rather than on sentiment, loyalty and faith.

Paradoxically, he admired the positivist philosopher Auguste Comte, like many of the Third Republic politicians he detested, with which he opposed German idealism. Whereas the Legitimist monarchists refused to engage in political action, retreating into an intransigently conservative Catholicism and a relative indifference to a modern world they believed was irredeemably wicked and apostate, Maurras was prepared to engage in political action, both orthodox and unorthodox (the Action Française&#x27;s Camelots du Roi league frequently engaged in street violence with left-wing opponents, as well as Marc Sangnier&#x27;s socialist Catholic Le Sillon). Maurras was twice convicted of inciting violence against Jewish politicians, and Léon Blum, the first Jewish French prime minister, nearly died from the injuries inflicted by associates of Maurras. His slogan was the phrase &quot;La politique d&#x27;abord!&quot; (&quot;Politics first!&quot;). Other influences included Frédéric Le Play, British empiricism, which allowed him to reconcile Cartesian rationalism with empiricism, and René de La Tour du Pin.

Maurras&#x27; religious views were likewise less than orthodox. He supported the political Catholic Church both because it was intimately involved with French history and because its hierarchical structure and clerical elite mirrored his image of an ideal society. He considered the Church to be the mortar which held France together, and the association linking all Frenchmen together. However, he distrusted the Gospels, written, as he put it, &quot;by four obscure Jews&quot;, but admired the Catholic Church for having allegedly concealed much of the Bible&#x27;s &quot;dangerous teachings&quot;. Maurras&#x27; interpretation of the Gospels and his integralist teachings were fiercely criticised by many Catholic clergy. However, towards the end of his life Maurras eventually converted from agnosticism to Catholicism.

Notwithstanding his religious unorthodoxy, Maurras gained a large following among French monarchists and Catholics, including the Assumptionists and the Orleanist pretender to the French throne, the comte de Paris, Philippe. Nonetheless, his agnosticism worried parts of the Catholic hierarchy, and in 1926 Pope Pius XI placed some of Maurras&#x27;s writings on the Index of Forbidden Books and condemned the Action Française philosophy as a whole. Seven of Maurras&#x27; books had already been placed on this list in 1914 and a dossier on Maurras had been submitted to Pius X.

It was not just his agnosticism which worried the Catholic hierarchy but that by insisting upon &quot;politiques d&#x27;abord&quot; he questioned the primacy of the spiritual and thus the teaching authority of the Church and the authority of the Pope himself. That this was the basis of the matter is shown by Jacques Maritain&#x27;s book &quot;Primauté du Spirituel&quot;. Maritain was associated with L&#x27;Action Française and knew Maurras. While his unease with the movement pre-dates the 1926 crisis, it was this which occasioned his alienation from Maurras and L&#x27;Action Française. This papal condemnation was a great surprise to many of his devotees, who included a considerable number of French clergy, and caused great damage to the movement. The papal ban was later ended by Pope Pius XII in 1939, a year after Maurras was elected to the &quot;Académie française&quot;.

===Legacy===

Maurras was a major intellectual influence of national Catholicism, far-right movements, Latin conservatism, and integral nationalism. He and the &quot;Action Française&quot; influenced many people and movements including General Francisco Franco, José Antonio Primo de Rivera, António Sardinha, Leon Degrelle, historian and journalist Álvaro Alcalá-Galiano y Osma, and autonomist movements in Europe. The Christian Democrat Jacques Maritain was also close to Maurras before the papal condemnation of the AF in 1927, and criticized democracy in one of his early writings, &quot;Une opinion sur Charles Maurras ou le devoir des catholiques&quot;. Furthermore, Maurrassism also influenced many writings from members of the &quot;Organisation armée secrète&quot; who theorized &quot;counter-revolutionary warfare&quot;. In Spain, the &quot;Acción Española&quot; adopted not only its far right monarchism but also its name from Maurras&#x27;s movement.

The influence extended to Latin America, as in Mexico where Jesús Guiza y Acevedo was nicknamed &quot;the little Maurras&quot;, as well as the historian Carlos Pereyra or the Venezuelan author Laureano Vallenilla Lanz, who wrote a book titled &quot;Cesarismo democrático&quot; (Democratic Caesarism). Other figures influenced include the Brazilian Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira. Maurras&#x27; thought also influenced Catholic fundamentalist supporters of the Brazilian dictatorship (1964–85) as well as the &quot;Cursillos de la Cristiandad&quot; (Christendom Courses), similar to the &quot;Cité Catholique&quot; group, which were initiated during 1950 by the bishop of Ciudad Real, Mgr. Hervé. The Argentine militarist Juan Carlos Onganía, who overthrew Arturo Illia in a military putsch in 1966, as well as Alejandro Agustín Lanusse, who succeeded Onganía after another coup, had participated in the &quot;Cursillos de la Cristiandad&quot;, as did also the Dominican militarists Antonio Imbert Barrera and Elías Wessin y Wessin, chief of staff of the military and an opponent of the restoration of the 1963 Constitution after Rafael Trujillo was deposed. In Argentina he also influenced the nationalist writers of the 1920s and 1930s such as Rodolfo Irazusta and Juan Carulla.

In 2017, Michael Crowley wrote that Steve Bannon, then chief strategist to President Donald Trump, &quot;has also expressed admiration for the reactionary French philosopher Charles Maurras, according to French media reports confirmed by &quot;Politico&quot;.&quot;
