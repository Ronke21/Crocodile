<text>Strategy &amp; Tactics (S&amp;T) is a wargaming magazine now published by Decision Games, notable for publishing a complete new wargame in each issue.

==Beginnings==
&quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; was first published in January 1967 under its original editor, Chris Wagner, intended as a better alternative to Avalon Hill&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The General&quot;. &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; began life as a wargaming fanzine published by Wagner (then a staff sergeant with the US Air Force in Japan), at first in Japan, then moving to the United States with Wagner.

Graphic designer Redmond Simonsen was hired soon after to improve the quality of the magazine. When subscriptions became stagnant, debts began to accumulate. Jim Dunnigan created the company Simulations Publications to save &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot;; Dunnigan had been contributing to the magazine since issue #2 (February 1967), and when Wagner was having financial difficulties he sold the rights to the magazine to Dunnigan for $1. A persistent rumor that Dunnigan had purchased &quot;S&amp;T&quot; from Wagner for one dollar, and that furthermore the dollar was not paid until much later, was confirmed by Wagner during an interview printed in &quot;S&amp;T&quot; issue #83 (&quot;The Kaiser&#x27;s Battle&quot;).

==Dunnigan era==
Dunnigan set up his new company SPI in the windowless basement of a building in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side, where he published his first issue, &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; #18 (September 1969); starting with that issue, every issue included a new wargame. Albert Nofi became an associate editor on the magazine in 1969. The first game published in issue #18 was &quot;Crete&quot;. Not only did this represent a break from the cautious policy of Avalon Hill (a pioneer company in modern commercial wargaming, and the leading company in the fledgling wargaming industry) in publishing only one or two games per year (for fear of new games cannibalizing sales of old ones), but the need for new game designs spurred research into many of the lesser-known corners of military history. Despite the diversity in themes, the style of the games was fairly consistent. They predominantly used a hexgrid for the maps and many rule concepts such as zones of control were repeated in many games.

In addition to the games, the magazine featured many articles on military history, many of them notable for applying modern quantitative analysis to battles that had traditionally been described in a narrative &quot;heroic&quot; style.

Avalon Hill continued to produce more than just wargames, priding itself on other themes, such as party games, sports titles, and children&#x27;s games. Dunnigan&#x27;s focus remained primarily on military history, and he felt that there was a market for detailed historical articles as an accompaniment to detailed and accurate games. (A single experiment in using the &quot;S&amp;T&quot; game format to explore the use of strategy and tactics in professional sports, &quot;Scrimmage&quot;, in issue #37, was not repeated.) &quot;S&amp;T&quot; now embarked on providing six new games a year, and at a much lower cost per game than was to be found elsewhere, with the magazine itself almost being a bonus. There was no middleman in the form of a local games store; subscribers got their games delivered right to their homes. Circulation of the magazine was substantial and games that might not otherwise sell went to subscribers automatically, eclipsing expected independent sales of most titles. SPI also benefited from having the magazine as an advertising vehicle for boxed (i.e. non-magazine) games, sold directly or through local games stores.

In 1972, &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; spun off &quot;Moves&quot; magazine, which was focused more on how to play the games.

S&amp;T&#x27;s circulation exceeded that of Avalon Hill&#x27;s &quot;The General&quot; by the mid-1970s, improving its physical appearance dramatically under the guidance of Redmond Simonsen. (SPI&#x27;s non-magazine games were improving by leaps and bounds also – their first games were made in black and white on regular paper; counters were simple colored paper that had to be cut out and glued to cardboard by the purchaser. Rules were not done in booklet form, but on large sheets of paper folded to letter-size as a cost-savings measure. There were no costs incurred, then, for cutting, collating or binding – nor for boxes or counter trays.) As die-cut counters, printed on both sides in full color, became the norm, they were included in the magazine games, as were two color and finally full color maps.

&quot;S&amp;T&quot; eventually made its magazine games available for purchase in stores with standard boxes, dice and counter trays, and also sold boxes and counter trays separately for the convenience of subscribers who wanted to store their subscriber game components in something other than the envelope the magazine had been delivered in.

By the mid-1970s, SPI&#x27;s annual income rose to the six-figure range, with paid staff numbering as many as 40 people, and with 40+ games being produced through both the magazine and boxed sales annually. Competition began to spring up, with many new companies appearing in the mid- to late-1970s. Wargaming was reaching its high-water mark, just as the release of &quot;Squad Leader&quot; by Avalon Hill took the wargaming world by storm (eventually resulting in an unprecedented 200,000 copies sold). Such faith was placed in the future of the industry that a Game Designer&#x27;s Guild was even created, in the hope that it just might be possible to earn a comfortable living providing wargames to the public.

==Dunnigan&#x27;s departure==
However, despite annual income declared at two million dollars, SPI&#x27;s sales declined, and while monetary income remained constant, increasing inflation eroded the company&#x27;s profits. Dunnigan&#x27;s departure in the late 1970s led to internal struggle at SPI in 1980; chief among SPI&#x27;s problems was poor marketing. Howie Barasch&#x27;s departure as marketing manager in the late 1970s was never properly rectified and the founder of &quot;S&amp;T,&quot; Chris Wagner, who was now a management consultant, was brought back into the fold to address SPI&#x27;s marketing problems. He found that many sales representatives, previously independently commissioned by SPI, had no idea they were still representing the company, and some didn&#x27;t even realize the company was still in operation, as no one had been in touch with them for several years.

In 1980 &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; spun off &quot;Ares&quot; magazine, which focused more on science-fiction and fantasy, and featured a game in every issue.

==TSR==
Financial mismanagement also cost SPI money, and a recession didn&#x27;t help matters. Negotiations began with Avalon Hill and then TSR, Inc. for a buy-out.

By the time of the buyout in 1982, SPI was selling an estimated 60-70% of all wargames in the world. Avalon Hill remained a bigger company, but only because it sold many more sports and general interest games than wargames. By this point, &quot;S&amp;T&quot; boasted 30,000 subscribers and the magazine was truly the flagship of SPI.

The popularity of &quot;S&amp;T&quot; reached the point where SPI began publishing a second magazine, &quot;Moves&quot;, that consisted primarily of articles on winning strategies for playing SPI games and additional scenarios for them. A third magazine, &quot;Ares&quot;, devoted to science-fiction and fantasy games and including one in each issue, was also published for a time.

One innovation of &quot;S&amp;T&quot; was its feedback system, in which readers could answer various multiple-choice questions on a return card, whose data would then be entered into a Burroughs minicomputer for analysis. Thus &quot;S&amp;T&quot; always had good information about which games readers were looking for.

When TSR purchased SPI in 1982, the company did not honor lifetime subscriptions to &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot;. SPI unfortunately had no assets to its name when the takeover occurred, but there were over 1,000 subscribers who had made a significant payment (in c. 1978 terms) for a &quot;lifetime subscription&quot; to &quot;S&amp;T&quot;, meaning that they were entitled to all future issues without any further payment. These subscribers were informed that their subscriptions would not be honored. People who had placed pre-release, paid, orders for certain games that had been in development were informed that they would receive neither the game they had paid for nor a refund of the money they had paid for it. TSR saved money in the short term, but alienated its best customers.

SPI&#x27;s design staff moved on to Avalon Hill, where they set up a subsidiary company based in New York called Victory Games. It produced many unique and popular titles, which by the late 1980s were outselling even Avalon Hill games. TSR continued making games, hoping to recoup its investment in SPI (another reason was the enthusiasm of some staff members for wargaming), but despite a healthier distribution chain than SPI had enjoyed, its wargame line was never successful. &quot;S&amp;T&quot; Magazine was eventually sold to 3W, a small company which published &quot;The Wargamer&quot; magazine, a direct competitor. By this time, other companies were also stepping up production, and a splintered market ensured that the days of selling 50,000 copies or more of a title were gone. Publishers became happy to sell 10,000 copies, with 20,000 being considered phenomenal.

TSR produced the magazine from issue #91 (Winter 1983) to #111 (1987) and then sold the rights for &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; to 3W.

==3W and Decision Games==

3W published the magazine from #112 (June 1987) to #139. It was during this decline that 3W continued its publication of &quot;S&amp;T&quot;, and James Dunnigan returned for a brief stint as editor of the magazine (Keith Poulter was the editor from issues #112 to #119, Ty Bomba from #120 to #129, James Dunnigan from #130 to #139). Although circulation began to increase again, subscriptions never recovered fully, and most sales were through game stores and not subscriptions, which meant third party retailers cut into profits. Sales were also no longer guaranteed.

3W&#x27;s Keith Poulter later left the business, and in 1991 &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; was sold to Decision Games, which has been publishing the magazine since issue #140 (February 1991). Since issue #176 (September/October 1995), Decision Games has also offered a newsstand version at a lower price without the wargame that comes in every regular issue. According to the official website &quot;by issue #216, more copies of the magazine edition were being produced than the game edition.&quot; In 2003, Decision Games spun off Strategy &amp; Tactics Press as a sister company for magazine and media development. In 2008, &quot;World at War&quot; magazine was begun which covers World War II. In 2012, &quot;Modern War&quot; magazine began which covers post-World War II military history. &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; continues to cover all periods in history and so the periods covered may overlap.

As &quot;S&amp;T&quot; reached its 40th year as a professionally produced magazine, it laid claim to being the longest continually published wargame magazine.

==Reception==
In Issue 7 of &quot;Perfidious Albion&quot;, Charles Vasey reviewed issue #55 and wrote, &quot;this isssue is worth getting&quot;, noting especially its article on the Thirty Years War.

===Awards and value===

&quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; won thirteen Charles S. Roberts/Origins Awards between 1974 and 2009, and in 1997 the magazine was inducted into the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame.

Back issues of &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; are highly valued by wargame collectors, and some have become quite expensive. &quot;S&amp;T&quot; magazine games that have not been played and have counter sheets intact (&quot;unpunched&quot;) are worth much more than played (&quot;punched&quot;) games.

<doc id="222469" wikidata="Q14286" url="?curid=222469" title="Chris Evert">
<text>Christine Marie Evert (born December 21, 1954) is an American former professional tennis player. One of the most successful players of all time, she was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 260 weeks (fourth-most of all time), and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Evert won 157 singles titles, including 18 majors (among which a record seven French Open titles and a joint-record six US Open titles). Alongside Martina Navratilova, her greatest rival, Evert dominated women&#x27;s tennis from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.

In singles, Evert reached the semifinals or better in 52 of the 56 majors she played, including at 34 consecutive majors entered from the 1971 US Open through the 1983 French Open. She never lost in the first or second round of a major, and lost in the third round only twice. Evert holds the record of most consecutive years (13) of winning at least one major title, and contested an all-time record 34 major women&#x27;s singles finals. Evert&#x27;s career winning percentage in singles matches of 89.97% (1309–146) is the second highest in the Open Era, for men or women. On clay courts, Evert&#x27;s career winning percentage in singles matches of 94.55% (382–22) remains a WTA Tour record. She also won three major doubles titles, two partnering Navratilova and one with Olga Morozova.

Evert served as president of the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association for eleven years, 1975–76 and 1983–91. She was awarded the Philippe Chatrier award and inducted into the Hall of Fame. In later life, Evert was a coach and is now an analyst for ESPN, and has a line of tennis and active apparel.

==Early life and family==
Evert was born in 1954 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Colette ( Thompson) and Jimmy Evert, and raised in a committed Catholic household. She is a 1973 graduate of St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Ft. Lauderdale.

Evert&#x27;s father was a professional tennis coach, and tennis was a way of life in his family. Chris and her sister Jeanne became professional tennis players; their brother John played tennis on scholarship at the University of Alabama and later at Vanderbilt University, and brother Drew had a tennis scholarship to Auburn University. Youngest sister Clare played scholarship tennis at Southern Methodist University. Chris, John, Jeanne, and Clare, all won titles at the prestigious Junior Orange Bowl in Florida.

==Tennis career==
Evert began taking tennis lessons from her father Jimmy Evert when she was five years old. He was a professional tennis coach who had won the men&#x27;s singles title at the Canadian Championships in 1947. By 1969, she had become the No. 1 ranked under-14 girl in the United States. Evert played her first senior tournament in that year also, reaching the semifinals in her hometown of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, losing to Mary-Ann Eisel in three sets. For years, this was the record for the furthest a player had reached in her first senior-level tournament. That record was broken when another Floridian, Jennifer Capriati, reached the final at Boca Raton in 1990. In 1970, Evert won the national 16-and-under championship and was invited to play in an eight-player clay-court tournament in Charlotte, North Carolina. The 15-year-old Evert defeated Françoise Dürr in the first round in straight sets before defeating Margaret Court 7–6, 7–6 in a semifinal. Court was the world No. 1 player and had just won the Grand Slam in singles. These results led to Evert&#x27;s selection for the U.S. Wightman Cup team as the youngest player ever in the competition.

Evert made her Grand Slam tournament debut at age 16 at the 1971 US Open; she received an invitation after winning the national 16-and-under championship. After an easy straight-sets win over Edda Buding in the first round, she faced the American No. 4, Mary-Ann Eisel in the second round. With Eisel serving at 6–4, 6–5 (40–0) in the second set, Evert saved six match points before going on to win 4–6, 7–6, 6–1. She made two further comebacks from a set down, against fifth seed Dürr and Lesley Hunt, both seasoned professionals, before losing in straight sets to top seed Billie Jean King in a semifinal. This defeat ended a 46-match winning streak built up through a variety of professional and junior tour events.

In 1973, Evert was the runner-up at the French Open and the Wimbledon Championships. A year later she won both those events during her then-record 55-consecutive-match winning streak, which included eight other tournament wins. She ended the year with a 100–7 match record, winning 16 tournaments including two Grand Slams, having been a finalist in her first Australian Open, and having for a fourth straight year reached the semifinals at the US Open. She was chosen as the year-end number one by the leading tennis experts and authorities of the day – except Bud Collins.

For the next five years, Evert was the world&#x27;s No.1 player. In 1975 she won her second French Open and the first of four straight US Open titles by defeating Cawley in a three-set final. Also in November of that year, the official WTA computer ranking system was instituted, with Evert being the first No. 1. In total, Evert logged 260 weeks at number one. Ten years after she had first achieved the number-one spot, she regained it in November 1985 at the age of 30 years and 11 months. That made her the oldest woman to have reached WTA number one, a record that stood for 27 years until Serena Williams surpassed it in 2013.

Evert&#x27;s domination of the women&#x27;s game and her calm, steely demeanor on court earned her the nickname of the &quot;Ice Maiden&quot; of tennis. Throughout her career, Evert was ranked number one in the world at the end of seven different years by &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine, by &quot;World Tennis&quot; magazine and as well as a majority of other major tennis experts from 1974 through 1978, and in 1980 and 1981.

The 1976 season held a unique distinction for Evert, as this was the only time in her career where she won both Wimbledon and the US Open titles in the same year. She defeated Goolagong Cawley in a thrilling three-set final on grass and then dismantled her on clay at Forest Hills, losing just three games. However, Evert lost to Goolagong Cawley again in the final of the Virginia Slims Championships. In all, Evert won 26 of 39 matches with Cawley. Evert&#x27;s 1976 performance earned her Sports Illustrated&#x27;s title of Sportsman of the Year. She is the first woman to be the sole recipient of this honor, and is one of only four tennis players to receive it.

The years 1977 and 1978 saw Evert continue to dominate the women&#x27;s game, winning two more US Opens. Evert won the final US Open played at Forest Hills on clay (1977) and the inaugural championship to be held on hard courts at Flushing Meadow (1978). She won 18 of 25 tournaments during this two-year period and had a match record of 126–7. Of particular note is that Evert skipped the French Open during these years (as well as 1976) to play in King&#x27;s World TeamTennis. The other noteworthy event was Evert&#x27;s three-set loss to eventual champion Wade in the semifinals of the 1977 Wimbledon Championships. It was Wimbledon&#x27;s centenary year, coinciding with Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee as monarch.

Though she was successful on all surfaces, it was on clay courts where Evert was most dominant. Beginning in August 1973, she won 125 consecutive matches on clay, losing only eight sets throughout; this run continues to stand as the benchmark among both men and women players. The streak was broken on May 12, 1979, in a semifinal of the Italian Open when Evert lost to Tracy Austin in a third-set tiebreaker. Evert said after the match, &quot;Not having the record will take some pressure off me, but I am not glad to have lost it.&quot; Evert rebounded with another clay court streak that reached 64 matches (including titles at the 1979 and 1980 French Open) before ending with a semifinal loss to eventual winner Hana Mandlíková at the 1981 French Open (a record of 189 victories in 191 matches on clay from 1973 to 1981).

Evert&#x27;s record of seven French Open singles titles stood for 27 years until being broken in June 2013 by Rafael Nadal. She still holds the French Open singles title record for female players. Evert held the record for most clay court Grand Slam titles (10, with seven French Opens and all three US Opens played on clay in 1975–77) before Nadal won his 11th French Open championship in 2018.
Three of her victories came in three-set finals against Navratilova. In 1975, Evert defeated Navratilova 2–6, 6–2, 6–1 to defend her title from the previous year. In 1985, Evert prevailed 6–3, 6–7, 7–5, a win that saw her capture the world No. 1 computer ranking for the fifth and final time.

Evert won at least one Grand Slam singles title a year for 13 consecutive years, from 1974 through 1986. During this period, Evert did not participate in the Australian Opens held from 1975 to 1980 and in 1983, or the French Opens from 1976 to 1978. The reasons for Evert&#x27;s non-participation in the Australian Open during the years of her greatest dominance (she was ranked No.1 in the world five of the six years she was absent from the event between 1975 and 1980) was the relative decline in the status of this Grand Slam tournament during that period. Evert&#x27;s absence from the French Open in 1976, 1977 and 1978 reflected the allure of World TeamTennis and the generally lesser significance that the top players attached to the traditional Slam events in the early years of the professional era. During this period of dominance (1975–80), she skipped ten Grand Slam tournaments.

Between September 1971 (her Grand Slam debut at the US Open) and June 1983 (her 12th visit to the Wimbledon Championships), Evert never failed to reach at least the semi-finals of the 34 Grand Slam singles events she entered. This string, however, was broken in the third round at Wimbledon in 1983 when the All England Club refused Evert&#x27;s request to delay her match with Kathy Jordan to recover from food poisoning. This defeat also ended her attempt to be the holder of all four Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, as Evert was then holder of the &#x27;82 Australian, U.S., and the &#x27;83 French titles. In 56 Grand Slam singles events entered from 1971 to 1989, Evert fell short of the semifinals a mere four times (1983 Wimbledon 3rd round; 1987 US Open quarterfinal; 1988 French Open 3rd round; 1989 US Open quarterfinal).

In total, of the record 34 Grand Slam finals reached, Evert won 18 Grand Slam singles titles: seven at the French Open (record for female), six at the US Open (an open era record, male or female, tied with Serena Williams), three at Wimbledon, and two at the Australian Open (both on grass). In addition, Evert won three Grand Slam doubles titles.

Evert played a reduced schedule in 1989 and retired from the professional tour after the US Open. Upon her retirement, she had amassed 18 Grand Slam singles titles (at the time, an Open Era record, male or female), won 157 singles titles (at the time, the record for male or female) and 32 doubles titles. Evert won the WTA Tour Championships four times and helped the United States win the Fed Cup eight times. Evert&#x27;s last match was a 6–3, 6–2 win over Conchita Martínez in the final of the 1989 Fed Cup.

===Rivalries===

During her career versus selected rivals, Evert was: 40–6 against Virginia Wade, 37–43 against Martina Navratilova, 26–13 against Evonne Goolagong Cawley, 24–0 against Virginia Ruzici, 23–1 against Sue Barker, 22–0 against Betty Stöve, 22–1 against Rosemary Casals, 21–7 against Hana Mandlíková, 20–1 against Wendy Turnbull, 19–7 against Billie Jean King (winning the last 11 matches with a loss of only two sets), 19–3 against Pam Shriver, 18–2 against Kerry Melville Reid, 17–2 against Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, 17–2 against Helena Suková, 17–3 against Andrea Jaeger, 16–3 against Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat, 15–0 against Olga Morozova, 13–0 against Françoise Dürr, 9–4 against Margaret Court, 8–9 against Tracy Austin, 7–0 against Mary Joe Fernández, 6–3 against Gabriela Sabatini, 6–5 against Nancy Richey Gunter (winning the last six matches), 6–8 against Steffi Graf (losing the last eight matches) and 2–1 against Monica Seles.

===Awards and recognitions===
Evert was voted the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year on four occasions and was the first female athlete to be &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s sole recipient of &quot;Sportswoman of the Year&quot; award in 1976. In April 1985, she was voted the &quot;Greatest Woman Athlete of the Last 25 Years&quot; by the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation. Evert served as president of the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association during 1975–76, and from 1983 to 1991.

In 1995, she was the fourth player ever to be unanimously elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame following a worldwide ballot of 185 sports journalists. In 1997, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) presented her with its highest accolade – the Philippe Chatrier Award – for her contributions to tennis, whilst 1999 saw Evert rated No. 50 among ESPN&#x27;s Greatest North American athletes of the 20th century. In 2005, &quot;Tennis&quot; named her fourth on its list of 40 Greatest Players of the &quot;Tennis&quot; era.

In 2012, Tennis Channel conducted a poll of players and experts to determine the 100 Greatest Players of all time, in which Evert ranked ninth overall, and fourth highest among women (finishing behind Graf, Navratilova, and Court in that order.) In June 2013, Evert was awarded a special merit from the International Tennis Hall of Fame. They presented her their gold ring in recognition of her outstanding achievements both on and off the tennis court.

==Playing style==
Evert was a baseline player who is credited with revolutionizing the sport of tennis. She was known for her consistent, counterpunching game, with her being described retrospectively by the International Tennis Hall of Fame as a &quot;human backboard&quot;. Evert was one of the first players to play exclusively from the baseline, typically approaching the net to retrieve short balls only; towards the end of her career, however, Evert would approach the net to end points more frequently. Evert&#x27;s forehand was hit flat, with consistent depth and power, penetrating deep into the court; towards the end of her career with the development of graphite technology, she would begin to apply more topspin to her forehand. Evert was one of the first women who successfully used a double-handed backhand on the WTA tour, which did not have the extra reach that a one-handed backhand afforded, but did provide power and consistency that was previously unseen on the tour, and would later become the norm for female tennis players.

Evert would not typically hit large numbers of winners, instead predicating her game on the retrieval of balls with devastating accuracy, and keeping unforced errors to a minimum. Evert did not possess a powerful serve, however, it was reliable and accurate. Evert possessed delicate touch, and had one of the most effective drop shots at the time. Playing in an era where serve and volleying was the dominant style of play, Evert was able to hit difficult passing shots with ease, pushing her opponents behind the baseline, and preventing them from rushing the net. Evert&#x27;s greatest strengths on court were her speed, detailed footwork, court coverage, fitness, consistency, and mental fortitude. Despite having success on all surfaces, Evert&#x27;s favorite surface was clay, where the high bounce and slower speed afforded by the surface allowed her to execute her measured, defensive style of play with tremendous success; this is highlighted by her career 382–22 (94.6%) winning record on the surface. Due to her composure, mental toughness, and elegant style of play, Evert was known as the &quot;Ice Princess&quot;.

==Personal life==
Before she won her first Grand Slam event, Evert signed a contract with Puritan Fashions to endorse a line of sportswear. Company president Carl Rosen thought so highly of her that he named a yearling racehorse Chris Evert in her honor. The horse went on to win the 1974 U.S. Filly Triple Crown, was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding 3-Year-Old Filly, and was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

In the 1970s, Evert&#x27;s romance with the top men&#x27;s player Jimmy Connors captured the public&#x27;s imagination, particularly after they both won the 1974 singles titles at Wimbledon. Evert and Connors also occasionally played mixed doubles together. They became engaged when she was 19 and a wedding was planned for November 8, 1974. The romance did not last, and the wedding was called off. In May 2013, Connors wrote in his autobiography that Evert was pregnant with their child and she decided to terminate the pregnancy. Evert replied that she was &quot;extremely disappointed that he [Connors] used the book to misrepresent a private matter&quot;.

While playing a match at the 1978 US Open, a diamond line bracelet Evert was wearing, given to her by Connors, fell from her wrist to the surface of the court. She said about this, &quot;I dropped my tennis bracelet&quot;, and since then diamond line bracelets have also been called &quot;tennis bracelets&quot;.
In 1979, Evert married British tennis player John Lloyd and changed her name to Chris Evert Lloyd. After her affair with British singer and actor Adam Faith, the couple separated, but reconciled and chronicled their marriage in a biography &quot;Lloyd On Lloyd&quot; co-authored by Carol Thatcher. The couple divorced in April 1987.

In 1988, Evert married American downhill skier Andy Mill, who had been introduced to her by Martina Navratilova. They have three sons. On November 13, 2006, Evert filed for divorce. The divorce was finalized on December 4, 2006, with Evert paying Mill a settlement of US$7 million in cash and securities.

On June 28, 2008, Evert married her third husband, Australian golfer Greg Norman in the Bahamas. On October 2, 2009, they announced they were separating after 15 months. Their divorce was finalized on December 8, 2009.

In 2021, Evert became a supporter of the new Women&#x27;s Sports Policy Working Group, formed in opposition to President Joe Biden&#x27;s executive order that mandates blanket inclusion for all transgender female athletes.

Evert&#x27;s sister, Jeanne, died of ovarian cancer following a two-year illness. Chris Evert underwent a preventive hysterectomy after learning she carried the BRCA gene mutation. Cancer was uncovered in her resected fallopian tubes in 2022. In May 2022, it was reported that Evert had completed chemotherapy treatment for her ovarian cancer. She stated her doctor told her there was a 90% chance the cancer would never return due to it being diagnosed early. In December 2023, she announced she had been diagnosed with a recurrence of cancer and is undergoing treatment again.
==Current work==
Evert owns the Evert Tennis Academy with her brother John in Boca Raton, Florida and helps coach the Saint Andrew&#x27;s School&#x27;s high school tennis team. She contributes to &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine, of which she is also publisher. In June 2011, she joined ESPN as a tennis commentator for Grand Slam tournaments. In 2015, she launched a line of tennis and active apparel in collaboration with Tail Activewear called Chrissie by Tail. She was also a member of the Athlete Advisory Committee for the 2019 Aurora Games.

On June 10, 2023, Evert presented the 2023 Women&#x27;s French Open Singles tournament trophy to Iga Świątek at Roland-Garros. Evert had won one of her own seven French Open titles forty years earlier in 1983.

* These records were attained in Open Era of tennis.
* Records in bold indicate peerless achievements.
* As Evert elected not to participate in a number of Grand Slam tournaments, the term &quot;consecutive&quot; is inexact. In 19 seasons of professional tennis, Evert competed in all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same year only six times.

<text>A match race is a race between two competitors, going head-to-head.

In sailboat racing it is differentiated from a fleet race, which almost always involves three or more competitors competing against each other, and team racing where teams consisting of 2, 3 or 4 boats compete together in a team race, with their results being combined.

In horse racing, it has historically been a format used for one-off events, but in 2009 IMRA, the International Match Race Association was created to enable anyone to enter a one-on-one horse race in all-terrain half-mile loops.

==Sailing==

The America&#x27;s Cup is an international competition in sailing which is broadcast worldwide. There are three single races or the equivalent of three games in most other sports. America&#x27;s Cup is a category of sailing called match racing in which two similar boats go head to head in a race or set of races to decide which boat has the better crew competing on board. In sailing there are three main ways of competing in order to find the best sailor, crew or boat. These are fleet racing, match racing and team racing; all of which are managed by the same governing body (ISAF), though each has slightly different rules.

==History==
The grounds for match racing were originally set about one hundred and forty four years ago when the first America&#x27;s Cup was set to take place. The match racing rules were set so that you could have two similar boats within a box rule, which specifies a maximum overall size for boats in the class, as well as features such as stability, that could go head to head in attempt to find the best sailing crews and teams. These rules allow one boat to try to attack the other by getting the other boat penalized so that it has to do what is called three sixty (this is turning the boat three hundred and sixty degrees around or as the rule that states, one tack and one gibe in the same direction), which puts the penalized boat at a large disadvantage compared to the others. After the America&#x27;s Cup, the first real match race took place at the Omega Gold Cup in Bermuda in the year 1937. It was considered the first real match race because it was sailed in one design boats (boats that are all exactly identical as they were built and managed by the same people), while the America&#x27;s Cup is a box rule which allows each of the boats to be different speeds. The skipper whom won this regatta was Briggs Cunningham. Briggs Cunningham also won the first America&#x27;s Cup that was held which incorporated the box rule. Since the Omega Gold Cup was a great success, match racing grew exponentially and created a new form of competitive sailing that had to have its rules managed and standardized. This resulted in The World Match Race Conference, which was a meeting with delegates from all major match racing regattas who decided on the rules and restrictions and who now supervise all match racing regattas.

==How the race is raced==
The Match Racing course has a very simple setup in comparison to fleet racing. In match racing there are usually four legs, although some events - such as the 2013 America&#x27;s Cup that has five - may set a different course. Two of the legs are upwind, or sailing against the wind, and the other two legs are downwind, or sailing with the wind. In the first leg the boats are tacking against the wind in order to get to the windward mark the fastest without being penalized while also trying to get the other boats penalized. As their boats and crew get to the windward mark they round it leaving it to starboard, or the right side of the boat. As they go around the mark they cannot touch it, and then they go on to the second leg. On the second leg the boats are going downwind, so they hoist their downwind sails(spinnaker) and go for what is called a gate in sailing, once again trying to get to the gate the fastest by gibing away from the other boat for clear wind or gibing toward another boat to take the opponents wind without getting penalized. A gate in is when there are two marks (buoys) and it is the crew&#x27;s choice as to which one they will go around once they start the rounding by going between the two marks and finish the rounding with only one mark next to them. When the boats go through the gate they are then on the third leg of the race. The third leg is basically a repeat of the first leg where they beat upwind going towards the windward mark. Once the boats round the windward mark again they are on the fourth and final leg where they race downwind towards the finish in hope of winning.

==Match racing in sailing==
A match race in sailing involves two boats racing, and contrasts with fleet racing (at least 3 boats, often many, all racing against each other) and team racing (two teams of 2, 3, or 4 boats per team).

===Tactics===
With a large enough fleet, the winning boat will generally be the one that finds the fastest possible way around the course. In contrast, match racers will only concentrate on crossing the line before their opponent: This sometimes means taking a route that&#x27;s not the fastest possible, for example, in order to slow down their opponent. As a result of this, special pre-start routines have been developed and two other tactics that arise from this mind-set are tight coverage and drawing fouls.

By tight coverage, the lead boat will attempt to stay as close as possible to its opponent while staying in front. For example, if on a downwind leg the losing boat gybes toward the right side of the course, the winning boat will gybe toward the right side of the course as well, even though the left side of the course appears to be favored. That way the winning boat is insured against losing the lead due to a wind shift that favors the right side of the course. In fleet racing there will often be boats on both sides of the course, requiring the lead boat to sail on the side that it considers to be fastest.

Drawing fouls is also an important part of match racing. As fouls in sailboat racing penalize the offending boat, but do not advantage the fouled boat, drawing a foul in fleet racing is almost always a net loss. However, when there are only two boats on the course any penalty for one boat is an advantage for the other. Therefore, in match racing a boat will often try to put itself in a position where the other boat will have no option but to foul it or make a disadvantageous change in course, even at the cost of sailing a slower course.

===Events===
Most match racing is between one-design boats, meaning that ideally the boats should perform identically on all points of sail and that any differences in performance are attributable to the crew. The design of America&#x27;s Cup Class boats is controlled by a complex formula which allows designers a fair bit of room to optimize for different expected conditions. This has resulted in boats that do not perform identically on all points of sail, which opens up another match racing tactic of forcing the opponent onto an unfavored point of sail. During the 2003 America&#x27;s Cup Challenger Series between Oracle BMW Racing and Alinghi, for example, the Alinghi boat was heavier but more powerful and favored on higher points of sail downwind. Alinghi used the tactic of getting to leeward of Oracle on a downwind leg and forcing her up onto a course where Alinghi was comparatively faster, although Alinghi herself could have sailed faster to the finish line on a lower course.

In the Olympics match racing was introduced during the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. The match racing took place in the Soling after selection races in fleet race format also in the Soling. This discipline was continued for the 1996 and 2000 Olympics. A new event for 2012 was the &quot;Women’s Keelboat Match Racing&quot;, using the Elliott 6m.

The World Match Racing Tour is the world&#x27;s pre-eminent monohull match racing series. It is sanctioned by the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) with &#x27;Special Event &#x27; status.

The Tour comprises a series of 9 events which cross 3 continents during the season combining the adrenaline fuelled excitement of match racing with close to shore racing which provides spectacular heart of the action views for the on shore audience. The championship series uses identical locally supplied racing yachts and includes such world class sailing venues as: Marseille, St. Moritz, Portimao, Kuala Terengganu, Gyeonggi and Hamilton.

The World Match Racing Tour has a proud match racing history since its establishment in 1988 and draws on the heritage of the very first match race for the King Edward VII Gold Cup at the City of Hamilton, Bermuda in 1937. The Bermuda Gold Cup is still an annual event which is a key stage of the World Match Racing Tour.

The Women&#x27;s International Match Racing Series (WIM Series), the first and only professional sailing series for women, was started in 2013 by the Women&#x27;s International Match Racing Association (WIMRA). The WIM Series consists of 4-5 events per year throughout the world.

Other notable match racing events in sailing include the Canada&#x27;s Cup and the Richardson Trophy, both held on the Great Lakes. The Richardson Trophy is governed and sponsored by the Yacht Racing Union of the Great Lakes.

The&#x27;Granddaddy of Match Racing&#x27; is the Congressional Cup, held at the Long Beach Yacht Club every Spring, It features 5 days of racing on identical 37 foot Catalinas that were purpose-built for this event by Frank Butler. The race is sailed off of the Belmont Pier in Long Beach, CA, and attracts many Sailors who go on to compete in the America&#x27;s Cup.&lt;https://thecongressionalcup.com&gt;

The San Francisco Perpetual Challenge Trophy, the second-oldest match racing championship, was first contested on San Francisco Bay in 1895, with the Encinal Yacht Club&#x27;s El Sueno defeating the San Francisco Yacht Club&#x27;s Queen by 11 minutes over a 15-mile course. The 2012 event saw the San Francisco Yacht Club&#x27;s classic Bird boat, Robin, defeat the Corinthian Yacht Club&#x27;s Polly in a best-of-three match sailed on September 15. Robin was skippered by 2002 US Rolex Yachtswoman of the Year Liz Baylis.

<doc id="222484" wikidata="Q629060" url="?curid=222484" title="Gog and Magog">
<text>Gog and Magog (; ) or Ya&#x27;juj and Ma&#x27;juj () are a pair of names that appear in the Bible and the Qur&#x27;an, variously ascribed to individuals, tribes, or lands. In Ezekiel 38, Gog is an individual and Magog is his land. By the time of the New Testament&#x27;s Revelation 20 (), Jewish tradition had long since changed Ezekiel&#x27;s &quot;Gog &quot;from&quot; Magog&quot; into &quot;Gog &quot;and&quot; Magog&quot;.

The Gog prophecy is meant to be fulfilled at the approach of what is called the &quot;end of days&quot;, but not necessarily the end of the world. Jewish eschatology viewed Gog and Magog as enemies to be defeated by the Messiah, which would usher in the age of the Messiah. One view within Christianity is more starkly apocalyptic, making Gog and Magog allies of Satan against God at the end of the millennium, as described in the Book of Revelation.

A legend was attached to Gog and Magog by the time of the Roman period, that the Gates of Alexander were erected by Alexander the Great to repel the tribe. Romanized Jewish historian Josephus knew them as the nation descended from Magog the Japhetite, as in Genesis, and explained them to be the Scythians. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes. Throughout the Middle Ages, they were variously identified as the Vikings, Huns, Khazars, Mongols or other nomads, or even the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.

The legend of Gog and Magog and the gates were also interpolated into the Alexander Romances. According to one interpretation, &quot;Goth and Magothy&quot; are the kings of the Unclean Nations whom Alexander drove through a mountain pass and prevented from crossing his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in human cannibalism in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on medieval cosmological maps, or &quot;mappae mundi&quot;, sometimes alongside Alexander&#x27;s wall.

The conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian and Islamic era. They appear in the Quran in chapter Al-Kahf as &quot;Yajuj&quot; and &quot;Majuj&quot;, primitive and immoral tribes that were separated and barriered off by Dhu al-Qarnayn (&quot;He of the Two Horns&quot;) who is mentioned in the Quran as a great righteous ruler and conqueror. Some contemporary Muslim historians and geographers regarded the Vikings as the emergence of Gog and Magog.

==Names==

The names are mentioned together in Ezekiel chapter 38, where Gog is an individual and Magog is his land. The meaning of the name Gog remains uncertain, and in any case, the author of the Ezekiel prophecy seems to attach no particular importance to it. Efforts have been made to identify him with various individuals, notably Gyges, a king of Lydia in the early 7th century BC, but many scholars do not believe he is related to any historical person.

In Genesis 10 Magog is described as a son of Japheth, and a grandson of Noah, although there is no mention there of a person named Gog. The name Magog itself is of obscure origin. It is often associated with Assyrian &quot;mat-Gugu&quot;, &quot;Land of Gyges&quot;, i.e., Lydia. Alternatively, Gog may be derived from Magog rather than the other way around, and &quot;Magog&quot; may be code for Babylon.

The form &quot;Gog and Magog&quot; may have emerged as shorthand for &quot;Gog and/of the land of Magog&quot;, based on their usage in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. An example of this combined form in Hebrew (&quot;Gog u-Magog&quot;) has been found, but its context is unclear, being preserved only in a fragment of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In Revelation, Gog and Magog together are the hostile nations of the world. Gog the Reubenite occurs in 1 Chronicles , but he has no connection with the Gog of Ezekiel or Magog of Genesis.

The Biblical &quot;Gog and Magog&quot; possibly gave derivation of the name Gogmagog, a legendary British giant. A later corrupted folk rendition in print altered the tradition around Gogmagog and Corineus with two giants Gog and Magog, with whom the Guildhall statues came to be identified.

==Jewish texts==
===Ezekiel===

The Book of Ezekiel records a series of visions received by the prophet Ezekiel, a priest of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, who was among the captives during the Babylonian exile. The exile, he tells his fellow captives, is God&#x27;s punishment on Israel for turning away, but God will restore his people to Jerusalem when they return to him. After this message of reassurance, chapters , the Gog oracle, tell how Gog of Magog and his hordes will threaten the restored Israel but will be destroyed, after which God will establish a new Temple and dwell with his people for a period of lasting peace (chapters 40–48).

Internal evidence indicates that the Gog oracle was composed substantially later than the chapters around it. Of Gog&#x27;s allies, Meshech and Tubal were 7th-century BC kingdoms in central Anatolia north of Israel, Persia towards the east, Cush (Ethiopia) and Put (Libya) to the south; Gomer is the Cimmerians, a nomadic people north of the Black Sea, and Beth Togarmah was on the border of Tubal. The confederation thus represents a multinational alliance surrounding Israel. &quot;Why the prophet&#x27;s gaze should have focused on these particular nations is unclear&quot;, comments Biblical scholar Daniel I. Block, but their remoteness and reputation for violence and mystery possibly &quot;made Gog and his confederates perfect symbols of the archetypal enemy, rising against God and his people&quot;. One explanation is that the Gog alliance, a blend of the &quot;Table of Nations&quot; in Genesis 10 and Tyre&#x27;s trading partners in Ezekiel 27, with Persia added, was cast in the role of end-time enemies of Israel by means of Isaiah 66:19, which is another text of eschatological foretelling.

Although the prophecy refers to Gog as an enemy in some future, it is not clear if the confrontation is meant to occur in a final &quot;end of days&quot; since the Hebrew term &quot;aḥarit ha-yamim&quot; () may merely mean &quot;latter days&quot;, and is open to interpretation. Twentieth-century scholars have used the term to denote the eschaton in a malleable sense, not necessarily meaning final days, or tied to the Apocalypse. Still, the Utopia of chapters 40–48 can be spoken of in the parlance of &quot;true eschatological character, given that it is a product of &quot;cosmic conflict&quot; described in the immediately preceding Gog chapters.

The Septuagint reads &quot;Gog&quot; instead of &quot;Agag&quot; in Numbers 24:7.

Over the next few centuries Jewish tradition changed Ezekiel&#x27;s Gog &quot;from&quot; Magog into Gog &quot;and&quot; Magog. The process, and the shifting geography of Gog and Magog, can be traced through the literature of the period. The 3rd book of the Sibylline Oracles, for example, which originated in Egyptian Judaism in the middle of the 2nd century BC, changes Ezekiel&#x27;s &quot;Gog from Magog&quot; to &quot;Gog and Magog&quot;, links their fate with up to eleven other nations, and places them &quot;in the midst of Aethiopian rivers&quot;; this seems a strange location, but ancient geography did sometimes place Ethiopia next to Persia or even India. The passage has a highly uncertain text, with manuscripts varying in their groupings of the letters of the Greek text into words, leading to different readings; one group of manuscripts (&quot;group Y&quot;) links them with the &quot;Marsians and Dacians&quot;, in eastern Europe, amongst others.

The Book of Jubilees, from about the same time, makes three references to either Gog or Magog: in the first, Magog is a descendant of Noah, as in Genesis 10; in the second, Gog is a region next to Japheth&#x27;s borders; and in the third, a portion of Japheth&#x27;s land is assigned to Magog. The 1st-century , which retells Biblical history from Adam to Saul, is notable for listing and naming seven of Magog&#x27;s sons, and mentions his &quot;thousands&quot; of descendants. The Samaritan Torah and the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible made during the last few centuries of the pre-Christian era) occasionally introduce the name of Gog where the Hebrew original has something else, or use Magog where the Hebrew has Gog, indicating that the names were interchangeable.

===Midrashic writings===
The anti-Roman Bar Kokhba revolt in the 2nd century AD looked to a human leader as the promised messiah, but after its failure Jews began to conceive of the messianic age in supernatural terms: first would come a forerunner, the Messiah ben Joseph, who would defeat Israel&#x27;s enemies, identified as Gog and Magog, to prepare the way for the Messiah ben David; then the dead would rise, divine judgement would be handed out, and the righteous would be rewarded.

The aggadah, homiletic and non-legalistic exegetical texts in the classical rabbinic literature of Judaism, treat Gog and Magog as two names for the same nation who will come against Israel in the final war. The rabbis associated no specific nation or territory with them beyond a location to the north of Israel, but the great Jewish scholar Rashi identified the Christians as their allies and said God would thwart their plan to kill all Israel.

===Commentary on Torah portion &quot;Nasso&quot;===
The &quot;Fruit of the Righteous&quot; or &quot;Pri Tzaddik&quot; on the weekly portion Nasso, connects Gog uMagog with Amalek. In this work from Rabbi Tzadok HaKohen of Lublin it can be read in chapter 15:2:&quot;And after all of this, there still will be war of Gog uMagog upon the Messiah son of Yoseph, for Gog uMagog is the seed of Amalek, and Amalek corresponds always to the opposite of the sanctity of Israel, deeply...&quot;.Similarly, in the Tanakh, book of Judges 5:14 (JPS 1985) it can be read: &quot;From Ephraim came they whose roots are in Amalek&quot;.

==Christian texts==

=== Revelation ===
Chapters 19:11–21:8 of the Book of Revelation, dating from the end of the 1st century AD, tells how Satan is to be imprisoned for a thousand years, and how, on his release, he will rally &quot;the nations in the four corners of the Earth, Gog and Magog&quot;, to a final battle with Christ and his saints:

When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the Earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.

=== Alexander Romance ===
The &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; of Pseudo-Callisthenes describes gates constructed by Alexander the Great between two mountains called the &quot;Breasts of the North&quot; (). The mountains are initially 18 feet apart and the pass is rather wide, but Alexander&#x27;s prayers to God causes the mountains to draw nearer, thus narrowing the pass. There he builds the Caspian Gates out of bronze, coating them with fast-sticking oil. The gates enclosed twenty-two nations and their monarchs, including Gog and Magog (therein called &quot;Goth and Magoth&quot;). The geographic location of these mountains is rather vague, described as a 50-day march away northwards after Alexander put to flight his Belsyrian enemies (the Bebrykes, of Bithynia in modern-day North Turkey).

Christian texts following in the tradition of the Alexander Romance, such as the Syriac Alexander Legend (late 7th century) and the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius (7th century) would continue to identify Gog and Magog as among those barbarian groups encapsulated behind Alexander&#x27;s walls, but they would also combine this with the apocalyptic motif of Revelation and assert that the end of the world would also involve the barbarian groups penetrating through the wall and bringing about the apocalypse.

==Islamic texts==

Two chapters of the Qur&#x27;an, &quot;Al Kahf&quot; (Chapter 18) and &quot;Al-Anbiya&quot; (Chapter 21), discuss Gog and Magog. In the Qur&#x27;an, Ya&#x27;juj and Ma&#x27;juj (Gog and Magog) are suppressed by Dhu al-Qarnayn (). Dhul-Qarnayn, having journeyed to the ends of the world, meets &quot;a people who scarcely understood a word&quot; who seek his help in building a barrier that will separate them from the people of Ya&#x27;juj and Ma&#x27;juj who &quot;do great mischief on earth&quot;. He agrees to build it for them, but warns that when the time comes (Last Age), God will remove the barrier.

The early Muslim traditions were summarised by Zakariya al-Qazwini (d. 1283) in two popular works called the Cosmography and the Geography. Gog and Magog, he says, live near to the sea that encircles the Earth and can be counted only by God; this sea is claimed to be the Caspian sea, Black sea or the Sea of Azov. They are human, but only half the height of a normal man, with claws instead of nails, and a hairy tail and huge hairy ears which they use as mattress and cover for sleeping. They dig into their wall each day until they almost break through. They break for the night saying, &quot;Tomorrow we will finish&quot;, but each night God restores it. Then one day, as they stop digging for the night, one will say, &quot;Tomorrow we will finish, God Willing&quot;, and in the morning, it is not restored as with every night. When they do break through, they will be so numerous that, &quot;Their vanguard is in Syria and their rear in Khorasan&quot;.

=== Location of the wall ===
The wall dividing them from civilized peoples was normally placed towards today&#x27;s Armenia and Azerbaijan, but in the year 842 the Caliph Al-Wathiq had a dream in which he saw that it had been breached, and sent an official named Sallam to investigate (this may be related to Ergenekon). Sallam returned a little over two years later and reported that he had seen the wall and also the tower where Dhul Qarnayn had left his building equipment, and all was still intact. It is not entirely clear what Sallam saw, but he may have reached Derbent in the Caucasus or the Jade Gate and the westernmost customs point on the border of China. Somewhat later the 14th-century traveller Ibn Battuta reported that the wall was sixty days&#x27; travel from the city of Zeitun, which is on the coast of China; the translator notes that Ibn Battuta has confused the Great Wall of China with that built by Dhul-Qarnayn.

=== Identifications ===

Various nations and peoples in history were identified as Ya&#x27;juj and Ma&#x27;juj. At one point, it was the Turks, who threatened Baghdad and northern Iran; later, when the Mongols destroyed Baghdad in 1258, it was they who were Gog and Magog. Others regarded the Vikings and their descendants as Gog and Magog, since the unknown group from Scandinavia had made their sudden and considerable entry into the history of Europe. Viking travelers and colonists were seen at many points in history as violent raiders. Many historical documents suggest that their conquests of other territories was retaliation in response to the encroachment upon tribal lands by Christian missionaries, and perhaps by the Saxon Wars prosecuted by Charlemagne and his kin to the south. Researches of professors and philosophers such as Allama Muhammad Iqbal, Syeed Abul Ala Mawdudi, who played important roles in British and South Asian politics, and American academic Abu Ammaar Yasir Qadhi and Caribbean eschatologist Imran N. Hosein, compare the languages, behaviors and sexual activities of the tribes of Gog and Magog with those of Vikings.

Some scholars further attempt to relate Yajuj and Majuj to the Lake of Tiberias, currently known as the Sea of Galilee, the Earth&#x27;s lowest freshwater lake, and the Dead Sea. Historian and exegete Ibn Kathir mentioned similar theories in his book &quot;Al-Bidaya wa&#x27;l-Nihaya&quot; and mentions &quot;Gog and Magog are two groups of Turks, descended from Yafith (Japheth), the father of the Turks, one of the sons of Noah&quot;.

=== In Indomalayan tradition ===
In Malaysian-Indonesian tradition, stories about Gog and Magog were introduced by way of translation from Abbasid-era Arabic texts by religious authorities. They increasingly became prominent during the 16th century, a period of heightened political rivalry and conflict. For example, a text known as the &quot;Hikayat Ya’juj wa-Ma’juj&quot; was read by some Malay warriors fighting against the Portuguese. Similarly, a poem originating in early 19th century Surakarta, a city located on the Indonesian island of Java, goes as far as to subvert Quranic teaching in order to use the story of Gog and Magog to vilify colonists from the Dutch colonial empire. Another text was the &quot;Hikayat Raja Iskandar&quot; (&quot;Story of King Alexander&quot;). This version argued, contrary to other traditions where both Gog and Magog variously descend from Adam, Noah, or Jesus, that Gog descended from the semen Adam produced while he dreamt of intercourse with Eve, and that Magog descended from the menstrual blood of Eve. Alexander (&quot;Iskandar&quot;) is taught this story by the prophet Khidr. Nūr ad-Dīn ar-Ranīrī (d. 1658), a Gujariti scholar, depicted Gog and Magog as infidel tribes that eat dogs, descendants of Noah, and originally from Turkey.

=== In Sunni and Shia sources ===
According to a tradition in Shia sources, Yajooj and Majooj are not from the Children of Adam (the human race). Al-Kafi, one of their primary collections of ahadith although by a non-Shia chain, states that it has been narrated from Ibn Abbas that when he asked Ali about the &quot;creatures&quot;, he responded by saying God has created &quot;1,200 species on the land, 1,200 species in the sea, 70 species from the Children of Adam and the people are the Children of Adam except for the Yajooj and Majooj&quot;. Al-Majlisi, an influential Shia scholar, quotes another tradition linking them to Chinese, Slavs, and Turkic people, and saying they are from the children of Adam, then saying that it is stronger than the former tradition and takes priority. 

Sunni sources, including those in Sahih Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, indicate that they are from the Children of Adam, and this is the belief of the overwhelming majority of Islamic scholars. The &quot;Abbasid orthodoxy&quot; believed the Ilkhanate Mongol invaders who laid siege to and then sacked Baghdad, were Gog and Magog. According to Sahih Muslim, prophet Muhammad said:
==Alexander the Great==

The 1st-century Jewish historian Josephus equated Magog with the Scythians in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, but he never mentioned Gog. In another work, Josephus recounts that the Alans (whom he calls a Scythian tribe) were given passage by the Hyrcanian king, a warder of an iron gate built by Alexander. By the time of Josephus, Alexander was already a Jewish folk hero. However, the earliest fusion of Alexander&#x27;s gate and the apocalyptic nations of Gog and Magog is a product of late antiquity, in what is known as the &quot;Syriac Legend of Alexander&quot;.

===Precursor texts in Syriac===

In the Syriac &quot;Alexander Legend&quot; dating to 629–630, Gog (, gwg) and Magog (ܵ, mgwg) appear as kings of Hunnish nations. Written by a Christian based in Mesopotamia, the &quot;Legend&quot; is considered the first work to connect the Gates with the idea that Gog and Magog are destined to play a role in the apocalypse. The legend claims that Alexander carved prophecies on the face of the Gate, marking a date for when these Huns, consisting of 24 nations, will breach the Gate and subjugate the greater part of the world.

The &quot;Pseudo-Methodius&quot;, written originally in Syriac, is considered the source of the Gog and Magog tale incorporated into Western versions of the Alexander Romance. The earlier-dated Syriac &quot;Alexander Legend&quot; contains a somewhat different treatment of the Gog and Magog material, which passed into the lost Arabic version, or the Ethiopic and later Oriental versions of the Alexander romance.

The &quot;Pseudo-Methodius&quot; (7th century) is the first source in the Christian tradition for a new element: two mountains moving together to narrow the corridor, which was then sealed with a gate against Gog and Magog. This idea is also in the Quran and found its way in the Western Alexander Romance.

===Alexander Romances===
This Gog and Magog legend is not found in earlier versions of the Alexander Romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes, whose oldest manuscript dates to the 3rd century, but an interpolation into recensions around the 8th century. In the latest and longest Greek version are described the Unclean Nations, which include the Goth and Magoth as their kings, and whose people engage in the habit of eating worms, dogs, human cadavers and fetuses. They were allied to Belsyrians (Bebrykes, of Bithynia in modern-day North Turkey), and sealed beyond the &quot;Breasts of the North&quot;, a pair of mountains fifty days&#x27; march away towards the north.

Gog and Magog appear in somewhat later Old French versions of the romance. In the verse &quot;Roman d&#x27;Alexandre&quot;, Branch III, of Lambert le Tort (c. 1170), Gog and Magog (&quot;Gos et Margos&quot;, &quot;Got et Margot&quot;) were vassals to Porus, king of India, providing an auxiliary force of 400,000 men. Routed by Alexander, they escaped through a defile in the mountains of Tus (or Turs), and were sealed by the wall erected there, to last until the advent of the Antichrist. Branch IV of the poetic cycle tells that the task of guarding Gog and Magog, as well as the rule of Syria and Persia was assigned to Antigonus, one of Alexander&#x27;s successors.
Gog and Magog also appear in Thomas de Kent&#x27;s &quot;Roman de toute chevalerie&quot; (c. 1180), where they are portrayed as cave-dwellers who consume human flesh. A condensed account occurs in a derivative work, the Middle English &quot;King Alisaunder&quot; (vv. 5938–6287). In the 13th-century French &quot;Roman d&#x27;Alexandre en prose&quot;, Alexander has an encounter with cannibals who have taken over the role of Gog and Magog. This is a case of imperfect transmission, since the &quot;prose Alexander&quot;&#x27;s source, the Latin work by Archpriest Leo of Naples known as &quot;Historia de Preliis&quot;, does mention &quot;Gogh et Macgogh&quot;, at least in some manuscripts.

The Gog and Magog are not only human flesh-eaters, but illustrated as men &quot;a notably beaked nose&quot; in examples such as the &quot;Sawley map&quot;, an important example of &quot;mappa mundi&quot;. Gog and Magog caricaturised as figures with hooked noses on a miniature depicting their attack of the Holy City, found in a manuscript of the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; in Anglo-Norman.

==Identifications==

=== Barbarian and nomadic identifications ===
Throughout classical and late antiquity, Christian and Jewish writers identified Gog and Magog with a wide diversity of groups:

* Romans. This identification was made by Eusebius.
* Goths. Gog and Magog were connected to the Goths by Ambrose (d. 397) and Jordanes (d. 555). The latter believed that the Goths, Scythians, and Amazons were all the same. The Goths also represent Gog and Magog in the ε and γ recensions of the Alexander Romance, where the term &quot;Gog and Magog&quot; forms a portmanteau with &quot;Goth&quot; to form &quot;Goth and Magoth&quot;.
* Scythians. The Scythian identification was made by Josephus, Jerome (d. 420), Jordanes, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrrhus, Isidore of Seville, John Zonaras, and Otto of Freising.
* Sarmatians and Alans. This identification was made in Josephus (for whom the Scythians were a subgroup of the Alans), Pseudo-Hegesippus, and the Chronicon Paschale.
* Huns. The Byzantine writer Procopius said it was the Huns Alexander had locked out, and in the Syriac Alexander Legend the kingdom of the Huns is also used to represent Gog and Magog. This identification can also be found in Andreas of Caesarea, as well as multiple Syriac and Greek texts which followed the identification found in the Syriac Alexander Legend over the course of the seventh century and beyond: the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ephraem, the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius, the &quot;Vita Alexandri&quot;, and Michael the Syrian.
* Haphthalites. This identification was made by Movses Kaghankatvatsi.
* Avars and Magyars. This identification was made by Isidore of Seville, Theodore Synkellos, the &quot;Anonymi Bele regis notarii Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, and the &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot;.
* Turks. In Islamic tradition, the following authors identified Gog and Magog as the Turks: Abu Hurayra, al-Dahhak ibn Muzahim, Al-Baydawi, Al-Qazwini, and Al-Majlisi.
* Khazars. This identification was made by Aethicus Ister, Iovane Sabanisje, Christian of Stavelot, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, and the &quot;Hadith Dhulqarnayn&quot;.
* Mongols and Tartars. This identification was made by the &quot;Historia de Preliis&quot;, Richer of Senones, Matthew Paris, Marco Polo, Hayton of Corycus, Riccoldo da Monte di Croce, and the &quot;Continuation of Barhebraeus&quot;. 
* Other. A Western monk named Fredegar seems to have Gog and Magog in mind in his description of savage hordes from beyond Alexander&#x27;s gates who had assisted the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (610–641) against the Muslim Saracens.

=== Eurasian steppes ===
As one nomadic people followed another on the Eurasian steppes, so the identification of Gog and Magog shifted. In the 9th and 10th centuries these kingdoms were identified by some with the lands of the Khazars, a Turkic people whose leaders had converted to Judaism and whose empire dominated Central Asia–the 9th-century monk Christian of Stavelot referred to Gazari, said of the Khazars that they were &quot;living in the lands of Gog and Magog&quot; and noted that they were &quot;circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism&quot;. Arab traveler ibn Fadlan also reported of this belief, writing around 921 he recorded that &quot;Khazars are part of the Gog and Magog&quot;.

After the Khazars came the Mongols, seen as a mysterious and invincible horde from the east who destroyed Muslim empires and kingdoms in the early 13th century; kings and popes took them for the legendary Prester John, marching to save Christians from the Muslim Saracens, but when they entered Poland and Hungary and annihilated Christian armies a terrified Europe concluded that they were &quot;Magogoli&quot;, the offspring of Gog and Magog, released from the prison Alexander had constructed for them and heralding Armageddon.

Europeans in Medieval China reported findings from their travels to the Mongol Empire. Some accounts and maps began to place the &quot;Caspian Mountains&quot;, and Gog and Magog, just outside the Great Wall of China. The &quot;Tartar Relation&quot;, an obscure account of Friar Carpini&#x27;s 1240s journey to Mongolia, is unique in alleging that these Caspian Mountains in Mongolia, &quot;where the Jews called Gog and Magog by their fellow countrymen are said to have been shut in by Alexander&quot;, were moreover purported by the Tartars to be magnetic, causing all iron equipment and weapons to fly off toward the mountains on approach. In 1251, the French friar André de Longjumeau informed his king that the Mongols originated from a desert further east, and an apocalyptic Gog and Magog (&quot;Got and Margoth&quot;) people dwelled further beyond, confined by the mountains. In the map of Sharif Idrisi, the land of Gog and Magog is drawn in the northeast corner (beyond Northeast Asia) and enclosed. Some medieval European world maps also show the location of the lands of Gog and Magog in the far northeast of Asia (and the northeast corner of the world).

In fact, Gog and Magog were held by the Mongol to be their ancestors, at least by some segment of the population. As traveler and Friar Riccoldo da Monte di Croce put it in c. 1291, &quot;They say themselves that they are descended from Gog and Magog: and on this account they are called &quot;Mogoli&quot;, as if from a corruption of &quot;Magogoli&quot;&quot;. Marco Polo, traveling when the initial terror had subsided, places Gog and Magog among the Tartars in Tenduc, but then claims that the names Gog and Magog are translations of the place-names Ung and Mungul, inhabited by the Ung and Mongols respectively.

An explanation offered by Orientalist Henry Yule was that Marco Polo was only referring to the &quot;Rampart of Gog and Magog&quot;, a name for the Great Wall of China. Friar André&#x27;s placement of Gog and Magog far east of Mongolia has been similarly explained.

===The confined Jews===

Some time around the 12th century, the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel came to be identified with Gog and Magog; possibly the first to do so was Petrus Comestor in &quot;Historica Scholastica&quot; (c. 1169–1173), and he was indeed a far greater influence than others before him, although the idea had been anticipated by the aforementioned Christian of Stavelot, who noted that the Khazhars, to be identified with Gog and Magog, was one of seven tribes of the Hungarians and had converted to Judaism.

While the confounding Gog and Magog as confined Jews was becoming commonplace, some, like Riccoldo or Vincent de Beauvais remained skeptics, and distinguished the Lost Tribes from Gog and Magog. As noted, Riccoldo had reported a Mongol folk-tradition that they were descended from Gog and Magog. He also addressed many minds (Westerners or otherwise) being credulous of the notion that Mongols might be Captive Jews, but after weighing the pros and cons, he concluded this was an open question.

The Flemish Franciscan friar William of Rubruck, who was first-hand witness to Alexander&#x27;s supposed wall in Derbent on the shores of the Caspian Sea in 1254, identified the people the walls were meant to fend off only vaguely as &quot;wild tribes&quot; or &quot;desert nomads&quot;, but one researcher made the inference Rubruck must have meant Jews, and that he was speaking in the context of &quot;Gog and Magog&quot;. Confined Jews were later to be referred to as &quot;Red Jews&quot; (&quot;die roten Juden&quot;) in German-speaking areas; a term first used in a Holy Grail epic dating to the 1270s, in which Gog and Magog were two mountains enclosing these people.

The author of the &quot;Travels of Sir John Mandeville&quot;, a 14th-century best-seller, said he had found these Jews in Central Asia where as Gog and Magog they had been imprisoned by Alexander, plotting to escape and join with the Jews of Europe to destroy Christians.

In the Borgia map, a copper-engraved world map probably produced in Southern Germany , the most eastern part contains two fortified regions depicting Gog and Magog, with the following Latin inscriptions:
:The province of Gog, in which the Jews were confined during the time of Artaxerxes, king of the Persians.
:Magog – in these two are large people and giants who are full of all kinds of bad behaviors. These Jews were collected by Artaxerxes from all parts of Persia.

The Persian king Artaxerxes (either Artaxerxes I or Artaxerxes II, appearing in the Book of Ezra 7) was commonly confused in medieval Europe with the Neo-Assyrian ruler Shalmaneser V, who according to 2 Kings 17 drove the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel into exile.

=== Kievan Rus ===
The twelfth-century chronicle &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; posited that the people of Kievan Rus&#x27; were descendants of the biblical Japheth, son of Noah, and of the tribe of Magog. According to political scientist Christopher Marsh, &quot;the implications&quot; of being descendants of the tribe of Magog, depicted as being thrown out of heaven in the biblical Revelation of John, &quot;apparently didn&#x27;t matter to those drawing&quot; the connection who believed that &quot;[a]ncestors were found in the Bible, and that was enough&quot;, allegedly making the Rus&#x27; a chosen people of the Christian God.

==Modern apocalypticism==
In the early 19th century, some Hasidic rabbis identified the French invasion of Russia under Napoleon as &quot;The War of Gog and Magog&quot;. But as the century progressed, apocalyptic expectations receded as the populace in Europe began to adopt an increasingly secular worldview. This has not been the case in the United States, where a 2002 poll indicated that 59% of Americans believed the events predicted in the Book of Revelation would come to pass. During the Cold War the idea that Soviet Russia had the role of Gog gained popularity, since Ezekiel&#x27;s words describing him as &quot;prince of Meshek&quot; – &quot;rosh meshek&quot; in Hebrew – sounded suspiciously like Russia and Moscow. Ronald Reagan also took up the idea.

Some post-Cold War millenarians still identify Gog with Russia, but they now tend to stress its allies among Islamic nations, especially Iran. For the most fervent, the countdown to Armageddon began with the return of the Jews to Israel, followed quickly by further signs pointing to the nearness of the final battle – nuclear weapons, European integration, the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War in 1967, and America&#x27;s wars in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.

In the Islamic apocalyptic tradition, the end of the world would be preceded by the release of Gog and Magog, whose destruction by God in a single night would usher in the Day of Resurrection. Reinterpretation did not generally continue after Classical times, but the needs of the modern world have produced a new body of apocalyptic literature in which Gog and Magog are identified as Communist Russia and China. One problem these writers have had to confront is the barrier holding Gog and Magog back, which is not to be found in the modern world: the answer varies, some writers saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are invisible.

<text>The horse Adios Butler, also known as &quot;The Butler&quot; (1956–1983), was a North American harness racing champion.

==Background==
Sired by the great Standardbred Adios and out of an obscure broodmare named Debby Hanover, Adios Butler was trained by Paige West and driven by Clint Hodgins in 1959.

==Racing career==
In 1959, Adios Butler won the Cane Pace, then the Little Brown Jug, where he was the first horse to win with a sub-two-minute mile, and finally, the Messenger Stakes, doing it in track and stake record time to become the first pacer to capture the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. In 1960, Adios Butler was sold in part to Ohio interests and while he remained in the care of Paige West, he was driven throughout the rest of his career by Eddie Cobb. He stood at stud at Fair Chance Farms in Washington Court House, Ohio.

The following year, he lost only one race on a muddy track and later recorded a 1:54.3 mile, the then-fastest time in harness racing history. Adios Butler was named &quot;United States Harness Horse of the Year&quot; in 1960 and 1961 by the U.S. Trotting Association and the U.S. Harness Writers Association.

==Stud record==
After his racing career, he was retired to stud. Adios Butler went on to sire such notable pacers as Honest Story, Pantry Man, El Patron, Escondido, Van Kirk, Uncle Frank, Ocean Mouth, Dean Butler, Lord Butler, Trial Lawyer, Starboard Butler and many others, despite facing fertility problems throughout his career as a stallion.

<text>Camp Nou (), meaning &quot;New Field&quot; and often referred to in English as the Nou Camp, is a stadium in Barcelona and the home of La Liga club Barcelona since its opening in 1957. It is currently undergoing renovation, and with a planned increased seating capacity of 105,000 it will be the stadium with the largest capacity in Spain and Europe, and the third largest association football stadium in the world.

Camp Nou has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga finals, and twenty-one Supercopa de España finals. It also hosted five matches in the 1982 FIFA World Cup (including the opening game), half of the four matches at the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup, and the football tournament&#x27;s final at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

Renovation of the stadium commenced after the end of the 2022–2023 season. Final completion of all renovations is scheduled for June 2026, although the club may return before that date. During the renovation, Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys is serving as Barcelona&#x27;s home ground.

== Construction ==

The construction of the Camp Nou started on 28 March 1954 as Barcelona&#x27;s previous stadium, Camp de Les Corts, had no room for expansion. Although originally planned to be called the Estadi del FC Barcelona, the more popular name Camp Nou (&quot;new field&quot;) was used. The June 1950 signing of László Kubala, regarded as one of Barcelona&#x27;s greatest players, provided further impetus to the construction of a larger stadium.

On 14 November 1950, the president Agustí Montal i Galobart obtained the favourable agreement of an assembly of members to acquire land for the construction of a new stadium, located in Hospitalet de Llobregat, which was later exchanged with the Barcelona City Council for other land in the neighbourhood of Les Corts. The stadium is located at the end of Travessera de les Corts, next to the Cementiri and the Maternitat. The commission dedicated to the project recommended another location in February 1951. The official purchase took place two years later.

The appointment of Francesc Miró-Sans as president of Barcelona, on 14 November 1953, was to relaunch the project. Invested in February of the following year, Miró-Sans decided in favour of the land acquired in 1950, and the first stone of the stadium was laid on 28 March 1954. A procession of several thousands of people made the journey from the Camp de Les Corts to La Masia de Can Planes, where the ceremony of laying the first stone was held, a solemn ceremony in the presence of Miró-Sans, the head of the Civil Government of Barcelona and the archbishop of Barcelona, Gregorio Modrego.

The project was completed one year later, when the club entrusted the construction to the building company Ingar SA. The work was supposed to last eight months, but the costs were more than four times higher than expected, reaching 288 million pesetas. Through mortgages and loans, the club managed to finish the project, borrowing heavily for several years. The club hoped to cover the cost with the sale of the land at Les Corts, but the Barcelona City Council took five years to requalify it, giving rise to a period of certain economic hardship, Finally, the head of state and of the Spanish government at the time, the dictator Francisco Franco, authorised the requalification of the land at Les Corts. During the course of the Camp Nou construction work, La Masia served as a workshop for making the models and a workplace for architects and builders.

The architects were Francesc Mitjans and Josep Soteras, with the collaboration of Lorenzo García-Barbón.

Finally, on 24 September 1957, the feast of La Mercè, the Camp Nou was inaugurated. A solemn mass presided over by the archbishop, who welcomed the finished stadium, preceded the Hallelujah from Handel&#x27;s Messiah. Dignitaries of the Franco regime and of the city gathered in the presidential tribune, and some 90,000 people attended the opening ceremony in the stands of the huge stadium. During the event, football clubs from all over Catalonia paraded on the field, as well as members of the different sections of Barça, the penyes and the different Barcelona teams.

Like Santiago Bernabéu Stadium of Real Madrid, the stadium was inspired by De Kuip, home of Feyenoord Rotterdam, which was built in 1937, and featured oval rings around the pitch, resulting in continuous stands without open corners.

== History ==

The stadium&#x27;s capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, and growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.
In May 1972, the Camp Nou hosted its first European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final between Rangers and Dynamo Moscow. Rangers won the match with a score of 3–2. Electronic scoreboards were installed in 1975.

The stadium underwent an expansion in 1980, in anticipation of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, which added boxes, VIP lounges, a new press area, new markers and the construction of the third tier, which was smaller in height than the original design by 6 metres (46.60 metres compared to the original design of 52.50 metres). The expansion of the stadium added 22,150 new seats, taking the total seating capacity to 71,731, and the standing capacity was expanded by 16,500 to 49,670, taking the total stadium capacity (seated and standing combined) to 121,401. Barcelona&#x27;s record attendance was set on 5 March 1986 in the European Cup quarter-final against Juventus in front of 120,000 spectators, just 1,401 shy of the stadium&#x27;s capacity.

The Camp Nou was one of several stadiums used throughout the 1982 World Cup, hosting the inauguration ceremony on 13 June. It also hosted more matches in that tournament than any of the 16 other stadiums used all over Spain, including the opening match, where the traditional opening ceremonies took place (including the releasing of a dove). In front of 95,000, Belgium upset the defending champions Argentina 1–0 in that opening match. It then hosted three round-robin matches between the Soviet Union, Poland and Belgium, which Poland ended up winning and qualifying from to reach the semi-finals, where they played Italy at the Camp Nou, losing 2–0; Italy went on to win the final match, which was played at Real Madrid&#x27;s Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid.

The Camp Nou also hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich, with both teams in contention to complete league title/domestic cup/European Cup trebles. Bayern led early through Mario Basler&#x27;s goal in the sixth minute and kept the lead as the clock reached 90 minutes, but United came back to win with injury time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær.

As well as hosting Barcelona, the Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team. The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua București was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4–0. The Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics. In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line.

The Camp Nou opened the FC Barcelona club museum in 1984. The stadium was renovated in 1993–94, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5 metres (8 feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favour of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998–99 season. During 1998–99, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities. Although popularly called Camp Nou, the stadium&#x27;s official name was actually “Estadi del FC Barcelona” since its completion, and it was not until the 2000–01 season that club members voted to officially rename the stadium to its popular nickname.

The facilities now include a memorabilia shop, mini-pitches for training matches and a chapel for the players. The stadium also houses the second-most visited museum in Catalonia, the Barcelona Museum, which receives more than 1.2 million visitors per year.

On 1 October 2017, Barcelona&#x27;s league match against Las Palmas was played in an empty Camp Nou due to political turmoil in the region.

In 2022, music streaming service Spotify reached a deal with Barcelona to acquire the naming rights to the stadium for four years in a deal worth $310 million. The stadium was rebranded as Spotify Camp Nou in July 2022.

== Renovation and expansion ==
The club issued an international tender to remodel the stadium as a celebration of the stadium&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary. The objective was to make the facility an integrated and highly visible urban environment. The club sought to increase the seating capacity by 13,500, with at least half of the total seating to be under cover. The intention was to make it the third-largest stadium in the world in terms of seating capacity, after the Narendra Modi Stadium in India (132,000 capacity) and Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in North Korea (114,000 capacity).

On 18 September 2007, the British architect Norman Foster and his company were selected to &quot;restructure&quot; the Camp Nou. The plan included the addition of roughly 6,000 seats, for a maximum capacity of 105,000, at an estimated cost of €250 million. The Barcelona board approved the sale of their former training ground (the Mini Estadi) against significant opposition in order to finance the remodeling. The project was planned to begin in 2009 and to be finished for the 2011–12 season. However, due to the 2008 financial crisis, the sale of the training ground was postponed, and likewise the remodeling project. In May 2010, Sandro Rosell, then a candidate for president of Barcelona, dismissed the possibility of selling the Mini Estadi, saying it would be indefensible to &quot;sell the crown jewels&quot;, and his election on 30 June 2010 effectively halted the plan to remodel the Camp Nou.

In January 2014, Barcelona&#x27;s board of directors rejected the option of building a new stadium due to financial constraints, and instead opted to remodel the Camp Nou to bring the capacity up to 105,000. The project was expected to run from 2017 to early 2021, with a cost of around £495 million (€600 million), making it one of the most expensive expansions on a per-seat basis. A refined plan was released in May 2015 showing plans to add a canopy over the stands and showing the plans for seating expansion in greater detail. Construction was planned in 2019 to begin in summer 2020 and to be completed in 2024.

On 28 April 2022, the club confirmed that renovations would begin after the 2022–23 season. Renovation work on the stadium began on 1 June 2023. At that time, Barcelona president Joan Laporta stated that the club expected to return by December 2024, when most of the work will be done. Final completion of all renovations is scheduled for June 2026. While the renovations are ongoing, Barcelona is playing home matches at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc.

== Other uses ==
Camp Nou has been used for various purposes other than football, often hosting major concerts. Some notable high-profile appearances include:
* Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass for a congregation of over 121,500 at Camp Nou on 17 November 1982, on the occasion being made an honorary citizen of Barcelona.
* Julio Iglesias appeared in concert here on 5 September 1983 and on 8 September 1988.
* Bruce Springsteen performed here on 3 August 1988 during his Tunnel of Love Express Tour in front of 90,000 fans. He was back on 19 and 20 July 2008 during his Magic Tour. He returned to the stadium on 16 May 2016 during The River Tour.
* On 9 August 1988, Michael Jackson appeared at the stadium in front of 95,000 fans during his Bad World Tour.
* On 10 September 1988, the Human Rights Now! charity concert organised by Amnesty International to support human rights featured, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Tracy Chapman, and El Último de la Fila. 

* A concert by the Three Tenors – Josep Carreras, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti – was held on 13 July 1997.
* U2 performed at the stadium three times: the first one was on 7 August 2005 during their Vertigo Tour, in front of a sold-out crowd of 81,269 people. The second and the third were on 30 June and 2 July 2009 during their U2 360° Tour, in front of a total crowd of 182,055 people. The encore performance of &quot;I&#x27;ll Go Crazy If I Don&#x27;t Go Crazy Tonight&quot; from the second 2009 show was filmed for the music video of the single.

On 4 November 2014, Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), which operates France&#x27;s professional rugby union leagues, announced that the 2015–16 Top 14 final would be held at the Camp Nou on 24 June 2016. The Top 14 final is traditionally held at the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. However, the scheduling of the 2015 Rugby World Cup caused the 2015–16 French season to be shifted by several weeks, in turn causing the Stade de France to be unavailable because it would be a major venue for UEFA Euro 2016. The match ultimately drew a crowd of 99,124, setting a new record for attendance at a domestic rugby union match.

On 18 May 2019, the first Super League game in Spain was hosted Camp Nou. The Catalans Dragons defeated the Wigan Warriors 33–16. This match set the Super League attendance record for a non-Magic Weekend, regular season fixture, attracting 31,555 fans.

In 2022, Barcelona had the largest known attendances for women&#x27;s football since the 1971 Women&#x27;s World Cup final,&lt;ref name=&quot;GOAL.com/SPOX.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico–Denmark (110,000), at the Azteca Stadium. Real Madrid and Wolfsburg were the visiting teams at Camp Nou in the Women&#x27;s Champions League (91,553 and 91,648).

== Transport connections ==
The stadium is accessible from the Barcelona Metro with the closest stations to Camp Nou are Palau Reial, Maria Cristina and Les Corts, on L3; Badal on L5 and Collblanc on L5 or L9. All are from Camp Nou, depending on which of the gates (accesses) to Camp Nou are used. Usually metro services are increased when there is a match, which causes significant passenger congestion.

A new station, named Avinguda de Xile / Camp Nou, is under construction and will be served by L9 and L10.

Approximately from Camp Nou there is the Trambaix Avinguda de Xile station (lines T1, T2 and T3).

Camp Nou is also served by several TMB bus routes, an AMB line, and four Nitbus services. Apart from regular routes, there are two special lines to Mossèn Jacint Verdaguer Square and to Catalonia Square on days with matches.

The stadium is located from the El Prat International Airport. It is connected by L9 from the airport directly to Collblanc, which is a short walk from the stadium.

<doc id="222491" wikidata="Q259463" url="?curid=222491" title="7th arrondissement of Paris">
<text>The 7th arrondissement of Paris (&quot;VIIe arrondissement&quot;) is one of the 20 arrondissements of the capital city of France. It is known for being, along with the 16th arrondissement and the &quot;commune&quot; of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the richest neighbourhood in France. In spoken French, this arrondissement is referred to as &quot;le septième&quot;.

The arrondissement, called Palais-Bourbon in a reference to the seat of the National Assembly, includes some of the major and well-known tourist attractions of Paris, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Hôtel des Invalides (Napoleon&#x27;s resting place), the Chapel of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, as well as a concentration of museums such as the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Musée Rodin and the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac.

Situated on the Rive Gauche—the &quot;Left&quot; bank of the River Seine—this central arrondissement, which includes the historical aristocratic neighbourhood of Faubourg Saint-Germain, contains a number of French national institutions, among them the National Assembly and numerous government ministries. It is also home to many foreign diplomatic embassies, some of them occupying outstanding hôtels particuliers.

The arrondissement has been home to the French upper class since the 17th century, when it became the new residence of France&#x27;s highest nobility. The district has been so fashionable within the French aristocracy that the phrase &quot;le Faubourg&quot;—referring to the ancient name of the current 7th arrondissement—has been used to describe French nobility ever since. The 7th arrondissement of Paris and Neuilly-sur-Seine form the most affluent and prestigious residential area in France.

==History==

During the 17th century, French high nobility started to move from the central Marais, the then-aristocratic district of Paris where nobles used to build their urban mansions (see Hotel de Soubise), to the clearer, less populated and less polluted Faubourg Saint-Germain.

The district became so fashionable within the French aristocracy that the phrase &quot;le Faubourg&quot; has been used to describe French nobility ever since. The oldest and most prestigious families of the French nobility built outstanding residences in the area, such as the Hôtel Matignon, the Hôtel de Salm, and the Hôtel Biron.

After the Revolution many of these mansions, offering magnificent inner spaces, many reception rooms and exquisite decoration, were confiscated and turned into national institutions. The French expression &quot;les ors de la Republique&quot; (literally &quot;the golds of the Republic&quot;), refers to the luxurious environment of the national palaces (outstanding official residences and priceless works of art), comes from that time.

During the Restauration, the &quot;Faubourg&quot; recovered its past glory as the most exclusive high nobility district of Paris and was the political heart of the country, home to the Ultra Party. After the Fall of Charles X, the district lost most of its political influence but remained the centre of the French upper class&#x27; social life.

During the 19th century, the arrondissement hosted no fewer than five Universal Exhibitions (1855, 1867, 1878, 1889, 1900) that have immensely impacted its cityscape. The Eiffel Tower and the Orsay building were built for these Exhibitions (respectively in 1889 and 1900).

==Geography==
The arrondissement has a total land area of . It has an average elevation of 47 m, with a minimum of 25 m and a maximum of 71 m. The 7th arrondissement borders the left bank of the Seine to the north, Rue des Saints-Pères to the east, and Rue de Sèvres to the south-east.

==Demography==
The 7th arrondissement attained its peak population in 1926 when it had 110,684 inhabitants. Because it is the location of so many French government bodies, this arrondissement has never been as densely populated as some of the others. In 1999, the population was 56,985, while the arrondissement provided 76,212 jobs.

In the 2017 French presidential election, the 7th gave right-wing candidate François Fillon 52.7% of its votes in the first round, compared to his poor national showing of only 20%. It then went on to vote for Emmanuel Macron in the runoff by a landslide.

The arrondissement hosted the equestrian events for the 1900 Summer Olympics.

<text>The Pacing Triple Crown is a series of three major harness races for three-year-old Standardbred pacers. It consists of the Cane Pace, the Messenger Stakes, and the Little Brown Jug. It was inaugurated in 1956, one year after the Trotting Triple Crown. A horse that wins all three races becomes a Triple Crown winner and is presented with the Pacing Triple Crown trophy.

The Little Brown Jug is the oldest of the three races. It has been held since 1946 at the Delaware County Fair in Delaware, Ohio. The Cane Pace was inaugurated in 1955 as the Cane Futurity and was initially raced at Yonkers Raceway; it has been held at Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey since 2015. The Messenger Stakes was founded in 1956 at Roosevelt Raceway and has been raced at Yonkers Raceway in Yonkers, New York since 2006. 

Adios Butler became the first Pacing Triple Crown winner in 1959. There have been 10 Pacing Triple Crown winners: Adios Butler (1959), Bret Hanover (1965), Romeo Hanover (1966), Rum Customer (1968), Most Happy Fella (1970), Niatross (1980), Ralph Hanover (1983), Western Dreamer (1997), Blissful Hall (1999), and No Pan Intended (2003). Western Dreamer and Blissful Hall are the only living Pacing Triple Crown winners.

<text>In the United States, the Trotting Triple Crown is a series of three major harness races for three-year-old Standardbred trotters. It consists of the Hambletonian, the Yonkers Trot, and the Kentucky Futurity. It was inaugurated in 1955 with the creation of the Yonkers Trot (then called the Yonkers Futurity). A horse that wins all three races is designated as a Triple Crown winner and receives the Trotting Triple Crown trophy.

The Kentucky Futurity, held at The Red Mile in Lexington, Kentucky, is the longest-running of the three events, having been inaugurated in 1893. The Hambletonian&#x27;s inception came in 1926, and it has been held at Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey since 1981. The Yonkers Trot has been held at Yonkers Raceway in Yonkers, New York since its inception in 1955.

The first horse to win the Trotting Triple Crown was Scott Frost, who won it in its inaugural year. Nine horses have won the Trotting Triple Crown: Scott Frost (1955), Speedy Scot (1963), Ayres (1964), Nevele Pride (1968), Lindy&#x27;s Pride (1969), Super Bowl (1972), Windsong&#x27;s Legacy (2004), Glidemaster (2006), and Marion Marauder (2016). Glidemaster and Marion Marauder are the only living Trotting Triple Crown winners.

Stanley Dancer is the only trainer to win the Trotting Triple Crown more than once as a trainer or a driver. Dancer trained and drove both Nevele Pride and Super Bowl to Triple Crown wins.

<text>Trapeze were an English rock band from Cannock, Staffordshire. Formed in 1969, the band originally featured former The Montanas members John Jones (trumpet, vocals) and Terry Rowley (keyboards), and former Finders Keepers members Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals, piano), Mel Galley (guitar, vocals) and Dave Holland (drums). Jones and Rowley left the band following the release of their self-titled debut album in 1970, with the lineup of Hughes, Galley and Holland continuing as a trio. After the release of &quot;Medusa&quot; later in 1970 and &quot;You Are the Music... We&#x27;re Just the Band&quot; in 1972, Hughes left Trapeze in 1973 to join Deep Purple.

Galley and Holland resurfaced with Trapeze a year later, adding second guitarist Rob Kendrick and bassist Pete Wright to the band. &quot;Hot Wire&quot; was released in late 1974 and a second self-titled album followed in 1975, after which the classic trio briefly reunited for a tour in 1976 when Hughes returned following Deep Purple&#x27;s breakup. After Hughes left again, Trapeze returned in 1978 with new frontman Peter Goalby, who performed on the band&#x27;s final album &quot;Hold On&quot;. Several more lineup changes occurred in the following years, including Holland joining Judas Priest in 1979, before the band broke up in 1982 as Galley joined Whitesnake.

In 1991, Hughes, Galley and Holland reunited Trapeze for a string of tour dates the following year, adding Asia keyboardist Geoff Downes for the shows. The tour resulted in a live album, &quot;Welcome to the Real World: Live at the Borderline&quot;, which was released in 1998. The trio revived Trapeze again in 1994 with second guitarist Craig Erickson, completing a brief tour early in the year before permanently disbanding.

Following the band&#x27;s breakup, both Galley and Holland remained relatively inactive, while Hughes continued with his solo career and collaborations with various artists. Galley died of oesophageal cancer on 1 July 2008, and Holland died of lung cancer on 16 January 2018, leaving Hughes the sole surviving member of the classic line-up.

==History==
===1969–1973: Formation and early releases===
Trapeze formed in March 1969, with the original lineup featuring former The Montanas members John Jones (trumpet, vocals) and Terry Rowley (keyboards, guitar, flute), along with former Finders Keepers members Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals, piano) Mel Galley (guitar, vocals) and Dave Holland (drums). One of the band&#x27;s early performances was filmed for an appearance on the BBC2 show &quot;Colour Me Pop&quot;, recorded on 5 July 1969 at Club Lafayette in Wolverhampton, at which they performed the song &quot;Send Me No More Letters&quot;. Local promoter Tony Perry described the show as &quot;one of the most outstanding nights at the [venue]&quot;, praising the band&#x27;s performance as &quot;fantastic&quot;. Later in the year, Trapeze signed as the first act on Threshold Records, a record label founded by The Moody Blues and distributed in the United States by London Records and elsewhere by Decca Records. The band reportedly declined an offer to join Apple Records, the label founded by The Beatles, as they believed that they would have more creative freedom with Threshold.
Working with The Moody Blues bassist John Lodge as producer, Trapeze recorded their self-titled debut album at London&#x27;s Morgan Studios and Decca Studios. Despite Jones being the band&#x27;s official lead singer, Hughes performed all vocals on the release. Hughes has revealed that he was asked to sing on the album by the group&#x27;s management, who deemed him to be the better of the two vocalists. Before the end of the year, the Rowley composition &quot;Send Me No More Letters&quot; was released as the band&#x27;s first single, backed with &quot;Another Day&quot; (written by Galley, Hughes and Jones). &quot;Trapeze&quot; was released in May 1970. The album was generally well received by critics – &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine described it as featuring &quot;a strong rock personality&quot; and dubbed it &quot;a candidate for big chart action&quot;, while journalist Nigel Williamson hailed it as &quot;a classic period example of English prog, mixing pastoral whimsy, swirling psychedelia, rock guitars and pop harmonies&quot;. It also received significant airplay on BBC Radio 1 from DJs such as Bob Harris and Pete Drummond, and was played in full by the station. &quot;Trapeze&quot; was promoted on a string of shows in the UK between January and July.

In August 1970, Jones and Rowley left Trapeze, returning to The Montanas. Rather than replacing the departed members, Hughes, Galley and Holland continued as a power trio, adopting a style more akin to hard rock and funk rock. On 13 November 1970, the band released their second album &quot;Medusa&quot; in the UK, which was issued in the US in March 1971. Produced again by Lodge, the album has since been highlighted by multiple critics as the band&#x27;s best release, as well as one of the decade&#x27;s most underrated hard rock albums. Writing in the booklet for a 1994 reissue of the album, author John Tracy claimed that &quot;Medusa&quot; was &quot;greeted with instant, and seemingly universal, acclaim&quot;. Ultimate Classic Rock writer Eduardo Rivadavia credited the album for contributing to the early development of the heavy metal genre in 1970. &quot;Black Cloud&quot;, written by Galley with brother Tom, was issued in the US as the only single from the album backed with &quot;Your Love Is Alright&quot;, written by the three band members.

Trapeze toured extensively in promotion of &quot;Medusa&quot;, primarily in the US, including a stint in December 1970 supporting The Moody Blues and numerous headline tours throughout 1971, before releasing their third album &quot;You Are the Music... We&#x27;re Just the Band&quot; on 1 December 1972. The album was primarily written by Hughes (three tracks were written by the Galley brothers), produced by Neil Slaven, and featured a number of guest contributors including Rod Argent on piano and B. J. Cole on steel guitar. The album marked an increase in softer, more melodic songs since &quot;Medusa&quot;, which were praised as highlights of the collection by multiple reviewers. &quot;Billboard&quot; dubbed the album a &quot;fine set&quot;, while Tracy described it as &quot;a masterpiece&quot;. &quot;You Are the Music... We&#x27;re Just the Band&quot; was the first Trapeze album to chart, peaking at number 9 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under chart, which acts as an extension to the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band toured throughout late 1972 and early 1973 in promotion of the album, including dates in the US and the UK. Prior to a show at the Village East in December 1972, the band&#x27;s equipment was stolen and they were forced to play using &quot;hastily rented equipment&quot;.

===1973–1976: Hughes&#x27;s departure and return===

In April 1973, Deep Purple members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice attended a Trapeze show at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, California, with a view to asking Hughes to replace bassist Roger Glover in the band. When approached at another show the following month, Hughes declined the invitation in favour of remaining with Trapeze, claiming that he was &quot;in a very, very different frame of mind as a musician&quot; at the time and dubbing Deep Purple &quot;too basic rock for me&quot;. However, due to the high-profile status of the group at the time, combined with the prospect of working with former Free frontman Paul Rodgers, who had been approached to replace vocalist Ian Gillan, Hughes reconsidered and agreed to join the band as bassist and second vocalist. The lineup change was officially announced in the music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; on 14 July 1973. Rodgers ultimately passed on the opportunity to join, focusing instead on the formation of Bad Company. David Coverdale was brought in as Gillan&#x27;s replacement later, after contacting the group in response to the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; article, which mentioned that they were still looking for a new singer. Hughes has since described the choice to leave Trapeze as a &quot;horrible&quot; one to make, dubbing the band his &quot;family&quot; and claiming in multiple interviews that to some extent he regrets leaving.

After a brief hiatus, Trapeze returned in 1974 with Galley on lead vocals, adding second guitarist Rob Kendrick and bassist Pete Wright to their lineup. In July it was announced that the band had signed with Warner Bros. Records, with a new album slated for release later in the year. Threshold issued the band&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;The Final Swing&quot; in October, which featured tracks from their first three albums as well as the previously unreleased &quot;Good Love&quot; and &quot;Dats It&quot;. The album was the band&#x27;s first to chart, entering the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 184 and peaking at number 172. December saw the release of the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Hot Wire&quot;, which peaked at number 146 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 153 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; albums chart, and number 161 on the &quot;Record World&quot; albums chart in early 1975. Former keyboardist Terry Rowley was also featured as a guest contributor on the album, performing synthesizers, organ, electric piano and backing vocals. Rowley remained in the touring lineup of the band for the &quot;Hot Wire&quot; cycle and featured on the album &quot;Live at the Boat Club 1975&quot;, although again not credited as a group member.

Later in 1975, Trapeze released a second self-titled album, on which Hughes returned to perform vocals on two tracks. &quot;Billboard&quot; praised &quot;Trapeze&quot; as an example of &quot;tight, cooking, soul-tinged hard rock&quot;, although AllMusic&#x27;s Dave Thompson criticised it as &quot;a dour little disc, desperately missing the funk infusions of Glenn Hughes and, for the most part, overshadowed even by its disappointing predecessor&quot;. Galley and Holland briefly took a break from Trapeze in November to complete a British concert tour with Justin Hayward and John Lodge, in promotion of their collaboration album &quot;Blue Jays&quot;, released earlier in the year. The following year, after Deep Purple broke up, Hughes temporarily reunited the classic trio of Trapeze for The Appreciation Tour, which was scheduled to visit the US in August and the UK in September. After a short run of US dates, Hughes left again due to off-stage problems caused by drug abuse, particularly cocaine. Speaking about the brief reunion in 2007, Galley recalled that Hughes &quot;wasn&#x27;t in a good state of mind at the time&quot;, suggesting that &quot;if we could have carried the electricity of those shows on, we could have known no bounds&quot;. Similarly, the band&#x27;s manager Tony Perry has recalled that Hughes &quot;[had] major problems at the time and was very difficult to deal with&quot;, adding that he and the other members of the band had discussed the possibility of firing and replacing him during the tour. During their reunion, the trio also recorded a number of new songs, including &quot;L.A. Cut Off&quot; and &quot;Space High&quot;, both of which were later released on Hughes&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Play Me Out&quot; in 1977.

===1978–1982: Later years and disbandment===
After Hughes left the band for a second time, Trapeze returned in 1978 with new frontman Peter Goalby and Wright returning on bass. Signing a deal with newly formed label Aura Records, the band released their final studio album &quot;Hold On&quot; in late 1979, produced by Jimmy Miller. The album, initially released in Germany in 1978 under the title &quot;Running&quot; with a different track listing, was hailed by &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s Graham Neale as the culmination of the band&#x27;s &quot;obvious regenerated enthusiasm&quot; following recent challenges, while Galley presented it as an evolution in the band&#x27;s sound and style of songwriting. The album received a positive review from &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, which described it as &quot;a noticeably strong ... LP that takes its strength from the tight vocal harmonies and solid original material&quot;, suggesting that &quot;Several of the songs included here could become AOR staples&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey hailed &quot;Hold On&quot; as &quot;quite possibly [Trapeze]&#x27;s best&quot; album, while his colleague Joe Viglione praised it for its songwriting and production qualities.
In August 1979, Holland left Trapeze to join heavy metal band Judas Priest. He was replaced later by Steve Bray as the band continued to tour in support of &quot;Hold On&quot;, including dates with Humble Pie and a stint supporting Scottish band Nazareth alongside Swiss group Krokus. The band released their first live album &quot;Live in Texas: Dead Armadillos&quot; in 1981, which was recorded on the resulting tour in May 1981. By the time the album was released, Goalby had left Trapeze to join Uriah Heep. Mervyn Spence (bass, lead vocals) and Richard Bailey (keyboards) joined the band later in the year, and in 1982 Bray was replaced by Kex Gorin. Trapeze officially came to an end in late 1982, when Galley joined a new lineup of Whitesnake in time for the Saints &amp; Sinners Tour, which commenced in October. The final lineup of Trapeze had begun recording material for a potential new album before Galley left, with the material later adapted for Whitesnake and Phenomena, a project started by Tom Galley.

===1991–1994: Reunions and live releases===
Hughes, Galley and Holland revived Trapeze in 1991 for a concert tour featuring keyboardist Geoff Downes. On 20 March 1992 they supported Fish at Hammersmith Apollo. In May 1992, the band recorded the live album &quot;Welcome to the Real World: Live at the Borderline&quot;, which was released in 1998. Another live album, &quot;Live: Way Back to the Bone&quot;, was released the same year, featuring recordings from earlier in the band&#x27;s career. The trio reunited again in 1993, recording a number of demos for a planned future release. On 9 February 1994, the band performed at the Irving Plaza in New York City as part of a concert dedicated to vocalist Ray Gillen, who had died on 1 December 1993. This was followed later in the year by a short string of shows in the US and the UK, which Hughes described as a &quot;wonderful run&quot; and a &quot;great experience&quot;. The trio were joined for the shows by second guitarist Craig Erickson. &quot;Live at the Boat Club 1975&quot; was released in 2006, before Galley died on 1 July 2008, ending any future chance of the band returning again. Nearly a decade later, Holland died on 16 January 2018, which now leaves Hughes the sole surviving member of the trio.

<doc id="222500" wikidata="Q482662" url="?curid=222500" title="Any Given Sunday">
<text>Any Given Sunday is a 1999 American sports drama film directed by Oliver Stone depicting a fictional professional American football team. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, Jamie Foxx, James Woods, LL Cool J, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Matthew Modine, John C. McGinley, Charlton Heston, Bill Bellamy, Lela Rochon, Aaron Eckhart, Elizabeth Berkley, and NFL players Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor.

It is partly based on the 1984 novel &quot;On Any Given Sunday&quot; by NFL defensive end Pat Toomay; the title is derived from a line in the book (also used in the film), that a team can win or lose on &quot;any given Sunday&quot;, said by the fictitious coach Tony D&#x27;Amato. The quote was originally derived from a statement made in 1952 by then-NFL commissioner Bert Bell, about the league&#x27;s devotion to financial and competitive parity.

Cameo roles also feature many former American football players, including Dick Butkus, Y. A. Tittle, Pat Toomay, Warren Moon, Johnny Unitas, Ricky Watters, Emmitt Smith and Terrell Owens, as well as coach Barry Switzer.

==Plot==
The Miami Sharks, a once-great American football team, are struggling to make the 2001 Affiliated Football Franchises of America (AFFA) playoffs. The team is coached by thirty-year veteran Tony D&#x27;Amato, who has fallen out of favor with young team owner Christina Pagniacci, and his offensive coordinator Nick Crozier. Crozier is also D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s expected successor.

In the thirteenth game of the season, both the starting quarterback Jack &quot;Cap&quot; Rooney and second-string quarterback Tyler Cherubini are injured and forced to leave the field. The desperate Sharks call on third-string quarterback Willie Beamen to enter the game. While a nervous Beamen makes a number of errors and fails to win the game for the Sharks, he plays well and gains confidence. Rooney vows to make it back by the playoffs, with D&#x27;Amato promising not to give up on him.

The following day, D&#x27;Amato and Pagniacci argue about the direction of the team. Pagniacci favors Crozier, and wants to eventually cut Rooney. D&#x27;Amato argues that Pagniacci&#x27;s father, the previous owner, would never have meddled in his coaching plans.

During the next game, to D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s chagrin, Beamen disregards the team&#x27;s conservative offense and changes plays in the huddle. As the media hails Beamen as the next model of quarterback, the newfound success feeds his growing narcissism and leads to tension with teammates and coaches. During a confrontation with Beamen, D&#x27;Amato demotes him to the bench.

After Beamen gives an interview in which he takes sole credit for the Sharks&#x27; winning streak, the other players refuse to perform for Beamen and consequently lose a home game. After Beamen is involved in a brawl with Julian &quot;J-Man&quot; Washington, an irate D&#x27;Amato expresses his embarrassment at his team before leaving. Beamen thinks about his behavior and amends his ways.

As the playoffs arrive, Sharks middle linebacker Luther Lavay reminds Beamen about how lucky he is to be in the league, and to find a life outside of football; his words fall on deaf ears. D&#x27;Amato worsens his relationship with Pagniacci and berates Rooney for second-guessing his availability. Before the game, D&#x27;Amato gives an energizing speech urging team unity that Beamen takes to heart and energizes the rest of the team. Rooney returns as starting quarterback but is injured with a concussion after scoring a touchdown.

Rooney urges D&#x27;Amato to let Beamen finish the game; after an argument, D&#x27;Amato relents. Subsequently, Pagniacci enters the locker room to demand that D&#x27;Amato play Beamen. After she and D&#x27;Amato argue, Beamen informs her that he had already been told that he would start the second half. Beamen apologizes to his teammates for his actions and leads the team to win. In a post-game talk with D&#x27;Amato, Beamen dedicates the next game to Rooney, but admits that he is worried about his ongoing health.

The Sharks eventually lose the championship (the Pantheon Cup) to San Francisco. At D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s final press conference as head coach, he is thanked by Pagniacci. D&#x27;Amato is expected to announce his retirement, but he instead drops two bombshells, announcing that he has been hired as head coach and general manager of an expansion team in New Mexico, the Albuquerque Aztecs, and that he has signed Willie Beamen to be his starting quarterback and franchise player.

==Fictional teams==

&quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; was filmed in Miami, Florida, and Dallas, Texas. The Orange Bowl in Miami represents the home of the fictitious American football team, the Miami Sharks, and Texas Stadium is used for the home of the fictitious Dallas Knights. These and the other made-up teams and their league, Associated Football Franchises of America (AFFA), are based on the National Football League. The actual NFL teams and league names are trademarked.

At the end of the film, D&#x27;Amato laments to gathered media about his team&#x27;s loss to San Francisco but does not reference their mascot. On the team schedule, the San Francisco Knights are mentioned, but this is likely a mistake because the Dallas team has that nickname. A team called the Pharaohs is mentioned during the Minnesota game without any city, so it is possible that they are the San Francisco Pharaohs.

==Cast==
* Al Pacino as Tony D&#x27;Amato, head coach of the Miami Sharks. Having held his position for decades and been given much autonomy by the team&#x27;s owner, &quot;Tony D&quot; is respected for great successes, including two Pantheon Cups, the championship for this (fictional) professional football league. He devoted so much time to the team that he became estranged from his wife and children. D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s traditional methods have come under fire from management and the media for recent failures, including missing the playoffs. Bitter that he was never promoted to general manager, D&#x27;Amato resents the hands-on &quot;interference&quot; of Christina Pagniacci, who succeeded her father Arturo as team owner. His last name comes from boxing trainer Constantine &quot;Cus&quot; D&#x27;Amato.
* Cameron Diaz as Christina Pagniacci, owner and general manager. She inherited the team from her father and boasts a Cornell MBA. She attributes the team&#x27;s disappointments to Coach D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s &quot;old-school methods&quot; and takes a more hands-on approach, bringing in innovative new offensive coordinator Nick Crozier as his eventual successor. She hints that D&#x27;Amato will not return after his contract expires, adding to his distractions. She also threatens to move the franchise if the city refuses to build a new stadium, causing a confrontation with the AFFA Commissioner and the Mayor of Miami.
* Dennis Quaid as Jack &quot;Cap&quot; Rooney, starting quarterback and team captain. Seen as being like a son to D&#x27;Amato, the two have been credited with the team&#x27;s greatest on-field successes. Rooney is now an aging veteran who faces injuries and conflicts with team personnel. Pagniacci wants to dump him. Relations have soured between Rooney and wife Cindy (Lauren Holly), the former of whom goads him without sympathy for his physical or mental situation, mercilessly browbeating him when he mentions retiring. Cap is injured during a game and is replaced, but is determined to make a comeback. Rooney recovers for the first round of the playoffs, wherein he plays well until suffering a hard hit while scoring a touchdown before halftime.
* James Woods as Dr. Harvey Mandrake, the unscrupulous team physician. He risks serious injury to players for the team to have a better shot at winning, often at the direction of Pagniacci. He is fired after his unethical methods are discovered by the conscientious team internist.
* Jamie Foxx as Willie &quot;Steamin&quot; Beamen, the third-string quarterback, out of the University of Houston. Beamen has a history that has led him to distrust his coaches. In particular, while playing for San Diego, Beamen was turned into a defensive secondary player for having &quot;fast feet&quot;, and was eventually injured while making a tackle. Beamen initially believes that racism played a major role in his history of being denied opportunities, using an alternative of &quot;placeism&quot; to describe a lack of African-American quarterbacks and head coaches in pro-football. Beaman becomes the starter after injuries to Rooney and the backup quarterback. Although surprisingly successful, Beamen causes tension among staff and teammates. He frequently either changes the plays that the coach calls or calls his own. These acts create major tension with D&#x27;Amato. D&#x27;Amato respects Beamen&#x27;s athletic ability and acknowledges that his talents warrant him to be a quarterback, but heavily criticizes his lack of leadership skills and intangibles. He is granted his own music video, and asks owner Pagniacci for a date when she enters a postgame locker-room full of naked or partly-dressed players like himself. Beamen&#x27;s antics on and off the field eventually get him demoted to the bench by D&#x27;Amato, who firmly believes that a quarterback&#x27;s most important role is to lead the team and help keep them confident, both for which Beamen took a clear disregard. Beamen eventually matures and is inspired by &quot;Cap&quot; Rooney&#x27;s gutsy performance in the Sharks&#x27; first playoff game.
* LL Cool J as Julian &quot;J-Man&quot; Washington, starting running back. He is very good but becomes increasingly angry at Beamen for his cockiness and tendencies to take plays away from him. He is motivated by incentive clauses in his contract, and D&#x27;Amato refers to him as a &quot;merc&quot; (mercenary) &quot;who will be gone before next season&quot;. Washington redeems himself to the team by running out of bounds to stop the play clock while his team was attempting an offensive drive with little time remaining.
* Ann-Margret as Margaret Pagniacci, Christina&#x27;s mother and the widow of the Sharks&#x27; original owner Arturo.
* Lauren Holly as Cindy Rooney, wife of Jack &quot;Cap&quot; Rooney. It is heavily implied that she is no more than a trophy wife, caring more for her wealth and social status than for her husband&#x27;s health and well-being.
* Lawrence Taylor as Luther &quot;Shark&quot; Lavay, starting middle linebacker and the captain of the defense. He has a cortisone addiction and is nearing the twilight of a very successful career, but he is held in high esteem by D&#x27;Amato for &quot;revolutionizing&quot; his position by being highly skilled in both pass rushing and defending against the run. Mandrake has concealed that &quot;Shark&quot; is suffering from a previous injury, a broken neck that did not heal properly. If he suffers another serious hit, he may be permanently disabled, suffer from seizures, or killed. The team&#x27;s internist informs him and D&#x27;Amato of the situation, but &quot;Shark&quot; says that he will lose a one-million-dollar bonus if he does not make his incentive stats (one sack and three tackles) or retire, as Powers suggests. He also has a confrontation with Beamen about the role of offense versus defense (which culminates with him cutting Beamen&#x27;s Chevrolet Suburban in half with a circular saw during a party). While making a hit, Shark is knocked unconscious. He awakens and is hauled away on a stretcher, satisfied that he made his one-million-dollar bonus.
* Jim Brown as Monte &quot;Montezuma&quot; Monroe, defensive coordinator. He is vocal and brings intensity to the defense and to the team in general. A longtime friend of D&#x27;Amato, who personally confides in Montezuma several times. Monroe states at one point that he would like to return to high school coaching where the game is &quot;pure&quot;.
* Aaron Eckhart as Nick Crozier, offensive coordinator. Nick is an offensive guru brought in from Minnesota by Christina Pagniacci. Young and tech-savvy (making use of a laptop computer while calling plays), he is highly critical of Tony&#x27;s old-fashioned ways, as well as Beamen&#x27;s changing the plays in the huddle and Julian&#x27;s playing for contract incentives. Despite the tension, D&#x27;Amato recognizes Crozier&#x27;s talent. He is named D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s successor after the coach departs to lead an expansion franchise in New Mexico.
* Bill Bellamy as Jimmy Sanderson, the wide receiver who becomes Willie Beamen&#x27;s first option on offense once he is moved into the starting Quarterback position, adding to the friction that is already building up between Willie and Julian.
* Matthew Modine as Dr. Ollie Powers, the team&#x27;s internist. He discovers that Dr. Mandrake is covering for players who are suffering from near-career-ending injuries, but are overdosing on painkillers, steroids and hormones to cover the pain. Powers faces his own dilemma needing to relieve the players&#x27; pain versus prescribing too much medication at the insistence of the addicted players.
* John C. McGinley as Jack Rose, an abrasive and prominent sports reporter. On his cable show, Rose displays an incredible distaste for all things D&#x27;Amato. This leads to D&#x27;Amato physically assaulting Rose near the end of the regular season, but no charges are pressed after D&#x27;Amato makes a public apology. In spite of their rivalry (or even because of it), Rose confesses that he will miss D&#x27;Amato when he retires.
* Lela Rochon as Vanessa Struthers, longtime girlfriend of Willie Beamen who unsuccessfully tries to pressure him into marriage after being humiliated by Cindy Rooney in front of the other football wives.
* Elizabeth Berkley as Mandy Murphy, a high-priced escort who provides Tony with a girlfriend experience when he is feeling lonely.
* Clifton Davis as Mayor Tyrone Smalls, who is always a few steps ahead of Christina in her efforts to leverage him into using taxpayer money to build a new stadium for the Sharks.
* Andrew Bryniarski as Patrick &quot;Madman&quot; Kelly, a starting offensive tackle with violent tendencies, who at one point threatens a jeering fan. 
* Charlton Heston as AFFA football commissioner.
* James Karen and Gianni Russo as Christina&#x27;s advisors.
* Duane Martin as Willie&#x27;s agent.
* Pat O&#x27;Hara as Tyler Cherubini, a journeyman quarterback who was initially second string quarterback after &quot;Cap&quot; Rooney is injured, before being injured himself, leading to Willie Beamen&#x27;s first game as quarterback.
* Mazio Royster as wide receiver.
* Rick Johnson as Dallas quarterback.
* Allan Graf as referee.
* Margaret Betts as mayor&#x27;s aide.
* Lester Speight as Sharks&#x27; security guard.
* Eva Tamargo as Tunnel reporter, game 3.
* Delia Sheppard and Jaime Bergman as party girls.
* Dan Sileo as Dallas defensive tackle.
* Sean Stone as fan (as Sean C. Stone).
* Antoni Corone as fan

==Production==
===Development===
Oliver Stone developed a script called &quot;Monday Night&quot; written by Jamie Williams, a former tight end for the Nebraska Cornhuskers and later the San Francisco 49ers, and Richard Weiner, a sports journalist. Stone separately acquired the spec script &quot;On Any Given Sunday&quot; by John Logan. Stone later amalgamated a third screenplay, &quot;Playing Hurt&quot; by Daniel Pyne, into the project.

As of May 1, 1999, the screenplay&#x27;s cover page listed the following writers: original draft by Jamie Williams and Richard Weiner, John Logan, Daniel Pyne; subsequent revisions by Gary Ross; revisions by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans; revisions by John Logan; revisions by Lisa Amsterdam and Robert Huizenga; latest revisions by Oliver Stone.

The Writers Guild of America ultimately awarded screenplay credit to Logan and Stone, with &quot;story&quot; credit to Pyne and Logan. Williams and Weiner went uncredited for their original screenplay, but were credited for their work on the film as technical consultants.

The screenplay was also based in part on the 1994 book &quot;You&#x27;re Okay, It&#x27;s Just a Bruise: A Doctor&#x27;s Sideline Secrets&quot; by Robert Huizenga. Huizenga was the intern doctor for the Los Angeles Raiders in their 1980s heyday, working under Dr. Robert T. Rosenfeld, who dismissed many players&#x27; injuries with the phrase, &quot;You&#x27;re okay, it&#x27;s just a bruise&quot;.

James Woods&#x27;s character is based on Rosenfeld. His first diagnosis of &quot;Cap&quot; Rooney&#x27;s career-threatening injury at the beginning of the film is &quot;you&#x27;re okay, it&#x27;s just a bruise&quot;. Huizenga left the Raiders in the early 1990s, disgusted at the way that the medical advice was kept from players and Rosenfeld being allowed to continue treating them after several mishaps, one of which is closely mirrored in the film—Shark&#x27;s neck injury and risk of sudden death, based on the real-life Mike Harden case.

===Casting===
Director Oliver Stone&#x27;s first two choices to play Tony D&#x27;Amato were Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Henry Rollins was offered a role as a football player but turned it down because he felt that he did not have the size to make the portrayal believable. Sean &quot;P. Diddy&quot; Combs was cast as Willie Beamen, but dropped out amidst rumors that he could not throw a football convincingly. Publicly, Combs dropped out of the project because of scheduling conflicts with his recording career. Will Smith turned down the role, saying that he was not interested. According to Cuba Gooding Jr., he met with Oliver Stone about playing the role of Willie Beamen, but Stone turned Gooding down because he had already played a football player in &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996). Chris Tucker turned down the role of Willie Beamen. George Clooney was offered the role of Jack Rooney, but turned it down because he thought that Stone was going to rewrite the script for him. Ving Rhames was originally cast in a role in the film, but he dropped out due to production delays and scheduling conflicts with &quot;&quot;.

Five Pro Football Hall of Fame players make cameo appearances as opposing head coaches: Bob St. Clair appears as the coach for Minnesota in the first game; Y. A. Tittle, for Chicago, appears in the second game; Dick Butkus, with California, appears during the road game; Warren Moon, with New York in the rain soaked game; Johnny Unitas appears as the coach in the fifth game.

Jim Caviezel played Tony D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s estranged son, but his scenes were cut. They can be seen in the &quot;Extra Features&quot; of the &quot;Oliver Stone Collection&quot; DVD. Tom Sizemore also had a role in the film, but it too was cut.

===Principal photography===
The film was shot in Miami, Florida, and Irving, Texas. When the team traveled to California, the stadium that was used is Pro Player Stadium, which is located in Miami Gardens. Texas Stadium (former home of the Dallas Cowboys) is used for the home of the fictitious Dallas Knights.

Director Oliver Stone failed to get the National Football League&#x27;s permission to use real NFL team logos and stadiums for the film. As a result, the Sharks play at the Miami Orange Bowl (which the NFL Miami Dolphins abandoned after the 1986 season) in the fictional Affiliated Football Franchises of America (AFFA), which is not to be confused with the real AFA; the AFFA exists alongside the NFL in this universe, as the Dolphins are mentioned in one scene.

For the scenes during a football game, production asked local schools to participate as extras for the film, including Lake Stevens Middle School in Miami, for each shot for which the crowd was asked to move around so that each section looked filled. In empty seats, cardboard cutouts were placed in seats with balloons attached to them so that they would seem to be in motion.

Practice scenes were filmed in the ill-fated Homestead Sports Complex, which was built for spring-training baseball; however, the stadium was damaged by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and eventually torn down without ever hosting a Major League team.

The film also uses Arena Football League players, such Pat O&#x27;Hara, who played for the Tampa Bay Storm and coached the Orlando Predators and became an assistant coach with the Tennessee Titans. Not to mention, Connell Maynor, who also played for the Predators and spent time as both a player and coach for the Philadelphia Soul. Meanwhile, Bjorn Nittmo, then with the AFL&#x27;s Buffalo Destroyers, was the Sharks&#x27; placekicker.

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack containing hip hop, rock and R&amp;B music was released on January 4, 2000, by Atlantic Records. It peaked at #28 on the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; 200&quot; and #11 on the &quot;Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums&quot;.

Oliver Stone wanted to use the music of the Canadian band Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and actually filmed a scene using their music. However, when he asked for permission, the band said no, and Stone was forced to redo the scene without the music.

Film composer Richard Horowitz, who supplied the original score, published his complete music for the film on a promotional CD.

&quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; was a financial success; made on a budget of $55 million, it went on to earn $100.2 million worldwide.

===Reception===
The film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave an aggregated score of 52% positive from 127 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Sometimes entertaining, but overall &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; is a disappointment coming from Oliver Stone.&quot; On Metacritic, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; has an aggregated score of 52%, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

&quot;Time Out&quot;&#x27;s Andrew Johnston wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s often been said of films about sports that smaller balls equal better movies. &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; explodes that theory, and not just because of the incredible intensity of its gridiron action. Oliver Stone&#x27;s best movie in many years—and one of his finest ever—looks at the world of professional football from almost every conceivable angle, but it never tries to be the definitive statement on the subject. A surprisingly balanced film that merges Stone&#x27;s hyperkinetic style with a character-centric narrative approach reminiscent of John Sayles and Robert Altman at their best, &quot;Sunday&quot; proves that powerful human drama and MTV visual pyrotechnics actually can coexist after all.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; also gave the film a mostly positive review, awarding it 3 stars out of 4, but criticized its length. &quot;I guess I recommend the movie because the dramatic scenes are worth it. Pacino has some nice heart-to-hearts with Quaid and Foxx, and the psychology of the veteran coach is well-captured in the screenplay by Stone and John Logan. But if some studio executive came along and made Stone cut his movie down to two hours, I have the strangest feeling it wouldn&#x27;t lose much of substance and might even play better.&quot;

Conversely, Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; criticized the story as being &quot;standard&quot;, and stated &quot;(a)lmost three hours of this jitter deteriorates from bravura filmmaking to annoying mannerism, and Any Given Sunday ends up less than the sum of its many, often interesting parts.&quot;

Rick Groen of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that the story was &quot;(c)hoc-a-bloc with manly blather about sacrifice and honour and rugged individuals pulling together for the greater glory of the team&quot;.

Elaborating on many critics&#x27; shared observations that the movie was &quot;hyperkinetic&quot;, Jack Matthews of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; stated that &quot;the sensation we get from the blizzard of images and teeth-jarring sound effects is of having our head used as the football&quot;.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized Dennis Quaid as too old for his part, Cameron Diaz as &quot;not up to the dramatic demands of her unsympathetic character&quot;, and the &quot;ludicrously upbeat&quot; ending, but complimented the portrayal of in-game action, in which the &quot;kinetic furor of the game sequences helps camouflage the weaknesses of a screenplay that is a mechanically contrived series of power struggles&quot;.

===Director&#x27;s cut===
When released to home-video on VHS and DVD, a new director&#x27;s cut by Oliver Stone was used. Due to the package listing, &quot;6 minutes of previously unseen footage&quot; and a running time of 156 minutes, many assumed that the theatrical cut was 150 minutes, and that Stone had added six minutes of footage. In actuality, the theatrical cut ran 162 minutes; 12 minutes were deleted for the director&#x27;s cut, and six minutes of new footage were added. Stone said that these changes were made to help the film&#x27;s pacing.

<doc id="222506" wikidata="Q2123628" url="?curid=222506" title="Acting President of the United States">
<text>An acting president of the United States is a person who lawfully exercises the powers and duties of the president of the United States despite not holding the office in their own right. There is an established presidential line of succession in which officials of the United States federal government may be called upon to be acting president if the incumbent president becomes incapacitated, dies, resigns, or is removed from office (by impeachment by the House of Representatives and subsequent conviction by the Senate) during their four-year term of office; or if a president-elect has not been chosen before Inauguration Day or has failed to qualify by that date.

Presidential succession is referred to multiple times in the U.S. Constitution: Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, the Twentieth Amendment, and the Twenty-fifth Amendment. The vice president is the only officeholder explicitly named in the Constitution as a presidential successor. The Article II succession clause authorizes Congress to designate which federal officeholders would accede to the presidency if the vice president were unable to do so, a situation which has never occurred. The current Presidential Succession Act was adopted in 1947 and last revised in 2006. The order of succession is as follows: the vice president, the speaker of the House of Representatives, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then the eligible heads of the federal executive departments who form the president&#x27;s Cabinet in the order of creation of the department, beginning with the secretary of state.

The vice president immediately assumes the presidency in the event of the death, resignation, or removal of the president from office. Similarly, if a president-elect were to die during the transition period or decline to serve, the vice president-elect would become president on Inauguration Day. A vice president may also serve as acting president if the president becomes incapacitated. If both the presidency and vice presidency were to become vacant, the statutory successor would act as president but would not formally assume the office. To date, three vice presidents have briefly served as acting president without assuming the office of President of the United States.

==Constitutional provisions==
===Eligibility===
The qualifications for acting president are the same as those for the office of president. Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution prescribes three eligibility requirements for the presidency. At the time of taking office, one must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least thirty-five years old, and a resident of the United States for at least fourteen years.

===Succession===
Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 makes the vice president first in the line of succession. It also empowers Congress to provide by law who would act as president in the case where neither the president nor the vice president were able to serve.

Two constitutional amendments elaborate on the subject of presidential succession and fill gaps exposed over time in the original provision:

* Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment declares that if the president-elect dies before their term begins, the vice president-elect becomes president on Inauguration Day and serves for the full term to which the president-elect was elected, and also that, if on Inauguration Day, a president has not been chosen or the president-elect does not qualify for the presidency, the vice president-elect acts as president until a president is chosen or the president-elect qualifies. It also authorizes Congress to provide for instances in which neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect have qualified. Acting on this authority, Congress incorporated &quot;failure to qualify&quot; as a possible condition for presidential succession into the Presidential Succession Act of 1947.
* Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provide for situations in which the president is temporarily or indefinitely unable to discharge the powers and duties of their office.
** The former section enables the president to voluntarily transfer their powers and duties (but not the office itself) to the vice president (who becomes acting president), by notifying the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives. The vice president remains acting president until such a time that the president is able to discharge their powers and duties again.
** The latter section provides a mechanism to remove the president&#x27;s powers and duties without their consent. It is invoked when the vice president and a majority of the 15 Cabinet secretaries write to the Senate president pro tempore and the House speaker to notify them that the president is unable to discharge their powers and duties. The vice president then immediately assumes the role of acting president. Should the president declare that they are still capable of discharging their powers and duties, the vice president and Cabinet secretaries can write a second letter to Congress, reaffirming their position. If this letter is received within four days, then the matter is debated and voted on by Congress (with any attempt to permanently install the vice president as acting president requiring a two-thirds majority of each house). If no such letter is received within the time limit or the vote does not pass in Congress within 21 days, then the president reassumes his powers and duties.

==History==
===Before the Twenty-fifth Amendment===

On April 4, 1841, only one month after his inauguration, William Henry Harrison died and was the first U.S. president to die in office. Afterward, a constitutional crisis ensued over the Constitution&#x27;s ambiguous presidential succession provision (Article II, Section 1, Clause 6).

Shortly after Harrison&#x27;s death, his Cabinet met and decided that John Tyler, Harrison&#x27;s vice president, would assume the responsibilities of the presidency under the title &quot;Vice-President acting President&quot;. Instead of accepting this proposed title, however, Tyler asserted that the Constitution gave him full and unqualified powers of the presidency and had himself sworn in as president; this set a critical precedent for the orderly transfer of power following a president&#x27;s death. Nonetheless, several members of Congress, such as representative and former president John Quincy Adams, felt that Tyler should be a caretaker under the title of &quot;acting president&quot;, or remain vice president in name. Senator Henry Clay saw Tyler as the &quot;vice-president&quot; and his presidency as a mere &quot;regency&quot;.

Throughout Tyler remained resolute in his claim to the title of president and in his determination to exercise the full powers of the presidency. The Senate and House confirmed Tyler as president via resolution. The precedent he set in 1841 was followed subsequently on seven occasions when an incumbent president died prior to the presidential succession being enshrined in the Constitution through section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment.

Though the precedent regarding presidential succession due to the president&#x27;s death was set, questions concerning presidential &quot;inability&quot; remained unanswered, such as what constituted an inability, who determined the existence of an inability, and whether a vice president becomes president for the rest of the presidential term in the case of an inability or if they are merely &quot;acting as president&quot;. Due to this lack of clarity, later vice presidents were hesitant to assert any role in cases of presidential inability.

On two occasions, in particular, the operations of the executive branch were hampered due to the fact that there was no constitutional basis for declaring that the president was unable to function:
* For 79 days in 1881, between the shooting of President James A. Garfield in July and his death in September. Congressional leaders urged Vice President Chester A. Arthur to step up and exercise presidential authority while the president was disabled, but he declined, fearful of being labeled a usurper. Aware that he was in a delicate position and that his every action was placed under scrutiny, he remained secluded in his New York City home for most of the summer.
* October 1919 – March 1921, when President Woodrow Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke. Nearly blind and partially paralyzed, he spent the final 17 months of his presidency sequestered in the White House. Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, the cabinet, and the nation were kept in the dark concerning the severity of the president&#x27;s illness for several months by First Lady Edith Wilson, the president&#x27;s personal physician, and his secretary. Marshall was pointedly afraid to ask about Wilson&#x27;s health, or to preside over cabinet meetings, fearful that he would be accused of &quot;longing for his place.&quot;

===Since the Twenty-fifth Amendment===
Proposed by the 89th Congress and subsequently ratified by the states in 1967, the Twenty-fifth Amendment, as noted above, established formal procedures for addressing instances of presidential disability and succession. As of , the powers of the president have only been transferred in accordance with Section3, covering the voluntary transfer of powers and duties. Section4, covering the involuntary transfer of powers and duties, has not been invoked since the amendment came into force. Three vice presidents have served as acting president on four occasions, each one while the president underwent a medical procedure under general anesthesia.

<doc id="222512" wikidata="Q44261" url="?curid=222512" title="Piano Concerto (Grieg)">
<text>The Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 16, composed by Edvard Grieg in 1868, was the only concerto Grieg completed. It is one of his most popular works, and is among the most popular of the genre. Grieg, who was only 24 years old at the time of the composition, had taken inspiration from Robert Schumann&#x27;s piano concerto (Op.54), also in A minor. 

== Structure ==
The concerto is in three movements:

Performance time of the whole concerto is usually about 30 minutes.

== Instrumentation ==
Grieg scored the concerto for solo piano, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (in A and B), 2 bassoons, 4 horns in E and E, 2 trumpets in C and B, 3 trombones, timpani and strings (violins, violas, cellos and double basses). An earlier version called for only two horns and a tuba instead of a third trombone.

== History and influences ==

The work is among Grieg&#x27;s earliest important works, written by the 24-year-old composer in 1868 in Søllerød, Denmark, during one of his visits there to benefit from the climate.

The concerto is often compared to the Piano Concerto of Robert Schumann: it is in the same key; the opening descending flourish on the piano is similar; the overall style is considered to be closer to Schumann than any other single composer. Incidentally, both composers wrote only one concerto for piano. Grieg had heard Schumann&#x27;s concerto played by Clara Schumann in Leipzig in 1858, and was greatly influenced by Schumann&#x27;s style generally, having been taught the piano by Schumann&#x27;s friend Ernst Ferdinand Wenzel.

Grieg&#x27;s concerto provides evidence of his interest in Norwegian folk music; the opening flourish is based on the motif of a falling minor second followed by a falling major third, which is typical of the folk music of Grieg&#x27;s native country. This specific motif occurs in other works by Grieg, including the String Quartet No. 1. In the last movement of the concerto, similarities to the halling (a Norwegian folk dance) and imitations of the Hardanger fiddle (the Norwegian folk fiddle) have been detected.

The work was premiered by Edmund Neupert on 3 April 1869, in Copenhagen, with Holger Simon Paulli conducting. Some sources say that Grieg himself, an excellent pianist, was the intended soloist, but he was unable to attend the premiere owing to commitments with an orchestra in Christiania (now Oslo). Among those who did attend the premiere were the Danish composer Niels Gade and the Russian pianist Anton Rubinstein, who provided his piano for the occasion. Neupert was also the dedicatee of the second edition of the concerto (Rikard Nordraak was the original dedicatee), and James Huneker said that he composed the first movement cadenza.

The Norwegian premiere in Christiania followed on August 7, 1869, and the piece was later heard in Germany in 1872 and England in 1874. At Grieg&#x27;s visit to Franz Liszt in Rome in 1870, Liszt played the notes &quot;a prima vista&quot; (by sight) before an audience of musicians and gave very good comments on Grieg&#x27;s work which would later influence him. The work was first published in Leipzig in 1872, but only after Johan Svendsen intervened on Grieg&#x27;s behalf.

The concerto is the first piano concerto ever recorded—by pianist Wilhelm Backhaus in 1909. Due to the technology of the time, it was heavily abridged and ran only six minutes.

Grieg revised the work at least seven times, usually in subtle ways, but the revisions amounted to over 300 differences from the original orchestration. In one of these revisions, he undid Liszt&#x27;s suggestion to give the second theme of the first movement (as well as the first theme of the second) to the trumpet rather than to the cello. The final version of the concerto was completed only a few weeks before Grieg&#x27;s death, and it is this version that has achieved worldwide popularity. The original 1868 version has been recorded, by Love Derwinger, with the Norrköping Symphony Orchestra under Junichi Hirokami.

Grieg worked on a transcription of the concerto for two solo pianos, which was completed by Károly Thern. The premiere recording of this version was by the British piano duo Anthony Goldstone and Caroline Clemmow. 

On April 2, 1951, the Russian-born American pianist Simon Barere collapsed while playing the first few bars of the concerto, in a performance with conductor Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in New York. He died backstage shortly afterwards. It was to have been Barere&#x27;s first performance of the work.

== Second concerto ==
In 1882 and 1883, Grieg worked on a second piano concerto in B minor, but it was never completed. The sketches for the concerto have been recorded by the pianist Einar Steen-Nøkleberg. In 1997, the Oslo Grieg Society held its Third International Competition for Composers on the theme: of &quot;re-imagine&quot; Grieg&#x27;s second concerto. One of the contestants, the Belgian composer Laurent Beeckmans, elaborated a full piano concerto from the sketches, which was first performed in London on 3 May 2003.

Another elaboration on Grieg&#x27;s sketches was completed by the Norwegian composer Helge Evju and was recorded by the Naxos label. Among the other contestants the Romanian Șerban Nichifor (&quot;Concerto GRIEGoriano&quot;), the Russian Vladimir Belyayev (&quot;Second Piano Concerto&quot;), the Scottish Callum Kenmuir (&quot;Rhapsody on themes by Grieg&quot;), the American Daniel Powers (&quot;Concerto Reliquary&quot;), the German Klaus Miehling (&quot;Concert Fantasy in B minor&quot;), the New Zealander Alison Edgar (&quot;Fantasia in B minor&quot;), the Australian David Morgan (&quot;Norwegian Fantasy&quot;). The 1st prize went to the Italian Alberto Colla (&quot;Piano Concerto No. 1&quot;).

== In popular culture ==
The enduring popularity of Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto has ensured its use in a wide variety of contexts.
* The first movement&#x27;s coda features in the film &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (1939) starring Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman.
* The Concerto was featured in the film &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot; (1945) as the piece played by the young concert pianist (Ann Todd; the uncredited pianist was Eileen Joyce).
* It was famously parodied in Franz Reizenstein&#x27;s &quot;Concerto Popolare&quot; of 1959 (written for Gerard Hoffnung&#x27;s music festival).
* The opening theme of the first movement was used by Jimmy Wisner, recording under the name &quot;Kokomo&quot;, in the song &quot;Asia Minor&quot;, a top-ten pop hit in the U.S. in 1961. The title of the song was also based on the key of the concerto, A minor.
* Excerpts from the first movement are incorporated into the number &quot;Rosemary&quot;, in the Broadway musical &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; (1961).
* Jethro Tull have played a short excerpt of the second movement live as part of their Thick as a Brick tour of 1972.
* The comedian Bill Bailey is a skilled musician, and has used Grieg&#x27;s piano concerto for comic effect; in the TV series &quot;Black Books&quot; it is played by his character Manny Bianco, and it is cited as an example in his solo mock-scholarly sketch on cockney music.
* The introductory motif opens &quot;Make the Most of Your Music&quot;, in the 1987 revised version of &quot;Follies&quot;.
* Cuban bandleader Alfredo Valdés repeatedly references the first movement of the concerto in &quot;Canto a La Vueltabajera&quot;.
* The strategy video game &quot;Civilization V&quot; also uses the second movement in its soundtrack.
* The second movement&#x27;s theme features in the spy thriller &quot;Red Sparrow&quot; (2018).

=== Morecambe and Wise ===
The concerto was used in a sketch by the British comedians Morecambe and Wise. Originally written by Dick Hills and Sid Green and performed as a two-hander in the ITV series &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; in 1963, the sketch was subsequently amended and used again in the Christmas edition of &quot;The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot;, the duo&#x27;s BBC series, in 1971. The sketch features Eric Morecambe as the piano soloist; while Ernie Wise was the conductor in the original sketch, the amended version features André Previn, then the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. Morecambe claims he is playing &quot;all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order&quot;. He was playing a simplified version of the correct music but in a completely inappropriate style.

The sketch was recorded, in an arrangement by Sid Green, in 1964 for the &quot;EMI Comedy Classics&quot; album series.

<text>Lillian Hardin Armstrong (née Hardin; February 3, 1898 – August 27, 1971) was an American jazz pianist, composer, arranger, singer, and bandleader. She was the second wife of Louis Armstrong, with whom she collaborated on many recordings in the 1920s.

Her compositions include &quot;Struttin&#x27; with Some Barbecue&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Jive Me&quot;, &quot;Two Deuces&quot;, &quot;Knee Drops&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; the Suzie-Q&quot;, &quot;Just for a Thrill&quot; (which was a hit when revived by Ray Charles in 1959), &quot;Clip Joint&quot;, and &quot;Bad Boy&quot; (a hit for the Jive Bombers in 1957). Armstrong was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Background==
Lil&#x27;s grandmother, Priscilla Martin, was a former slave from near Oxford, Mississippi. Martin had a son and three daughters, one of whom was Dempsey, Lil&#x27;s mother. Priscilla Martin moved her family to Memphis to escape from her husband, a trek the family made by mule-drawn wagon. Dempsey married Will Harden, and Lillian Hardin was born on February 3, 1898. She grew up in a household with her grandmother. Will died when Lil was seven. Dempsey later remarried to John Miller.

During her early years, Hardin was taught hymns, spirituals, and classical music on the piano. She was drawn to popular music and later blues.

==Early education and mentors==
Hardin first received piano instruction from her third-grade teacher, Violet White. Her mother then enrolled her in Mrs. Hook&#x27;s School of Music. At Fisk University, a college for African Americans in Nashville, she received more advanced training, and earning a diploma from Fisk, returned to Memphis in 1917. In August 1918, she moved to Chicago with her mother and stepfather. By then she had become a proficient sight-reader, a skill that helped her gain a job as a sheet music demonstrator at Jones Music Store.

The store paid Hardin $3 a week ($61 in 2023 dollars), but bandleader Lawrence Duhé offered $22.50 ($458 in 2023 dollars). Knowing that her mother would disapprove of her working in a cabaret, she made it known that her new job was playing for a dancing school. As observed by Thomas Brothers, the discrepancies between her education and that of Duhé&#x27;s band members were apparent; when she asked what key the New Orleanians were going to play in, they remarked, &quot;We don&#x27;t know what key. When you hear two knocks start playing.&quot; Three weeks later the band moved to a better booking at the De Luxe Café, where the entertainers included Florence Mills and Cora Green. From there, the band moved up to Dreamland. Here the principal entertainers were Alberta Hunter and Ollie Powers. When King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band replaced Duhé&#x27;s group at Dreamland, Oliver asked Hardin to stay with him. She was with Oliver at Dreamland in 1921 when an offer came for the orchestra to play a six-month engagement at the Pergola Ballroom in San Francisco. At the end of that booking Hardin returned to Chicago while the rest of the Oliver band went to Los Angeles. She later studied at the New York College of Music, where she earned a post-graduate diploma in 1929.

==Marriages and divorces==
In Chicago, Hardin returned to work at Dreamland as a pianist in an orchestra for Mae Brady, a violinist and vaudeville stalwart. While there, she fell for Jimmie Johnson, a young singer from Washington, D.C., whom she married on August 22, 1922. The marriage was short-lived, ending in divorce. The Oliver band returned from California and opened at the Royal Gardens with Bertha Gonsoulin at the piano but soon found itself back at Dreamland with Hardin at the piano.

King Oliver&#x27;s band was enjoying enormous success at Dreamland when he sent for Louis Armstrong to join as second cornetist. Armstrong was beginning to make a name for himself in New Orleans and regarded Oliver (&quot;Papa Joe&quot;) as his mentor. At first, Hardin was unimpressed, remembering that she &quot;was very disgusted&quot; by Louis, who arrived in Chicago wearing clothes and a hair style that she deemed to be &quot;too country&quot; for Chicago, but she worked to &quot;take the country out of him&quot;, and a romance developed (to the surprise of other band members, some of whom had been trying to woo her for some time with no success). They would visit cabarets and after-hour spots after their job at Lincoln Gardens, but their relationship was solidified after Armstrong&#x27;s mother&#x27;s intervention in 1923, when she visited Armstrong in Chicago. She and Armstrong needed to be divorced from their previous relationships (Lil Hardin to Jimmie Johnson, Louis Armstrong to Daisy Armstrong) and &quot;claimed desertion&quot; from said relationships to annul the marriages. Hardin and Armstrong were married on February 5, 1924, and honeymooned/toured with the Oliver band in Biglerville, Pennsylvania. The &quot;Defender&quot; noted that Hardin was dressed in a &quot;Parisian gown of white crepe elaborately beaded in rhinestones and silver beads.&quot;

Hardin took Armstrong shopping and taught him how to dress more fashionably. She got rid of his bangs and began working to foster his career. In addition to updating his appearance, Hardin assisted Armstrong in learning classical music with the help of a German teacher in Chicago. She felt he was wasting his talent in a secondary role. Armstrong was happy to be playing next to his idol, but Hardin at first persuaded him to manage his own money and assert himself on the bandstand and during recording sessions; eventually, she convinced him to leave Oliver and go out on his own. Armstrong resigned from Oliver&#x27;s band and in September 1924 accepted a job with bandleader Fletcher Henderson in New York City. Hardin stayed in Chicago, first with Oliver, then leading a band of her own. When Hardin&#x27;s band got a job at the Dreamland Café in Chicago she prepared for Armstrong&#x27;s return to Chicago by having a huge banner that read &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Trumpet Player&quot;.

Richard M. Jones convinced Okeh Records to make a series of sessions under his name: the Armstrong &quot;Hot Five&quot; recordings. With Hardin at the piano, Kid Ory on trombone, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, and Johnny St. Cyr on banjo, this group rehearsed at Armstrong and Hardin&#x27;s residence on Chicago&#x27;s East 41st Street and held its first session on November 15, 1925.

In the late 1920s, Hardin and Armstrong grew apart due to class differences and money issues. He formed a new Hot Five with Earl Hines on piano. Hardin reformed her own band with Freddie Keppard, whom she considered second only to Armstrong. Hardin and Armstrong separated in 1931 when he had a liaison with Alpha Smith, who threatened to sue Armstrong for breach of promise, so he begged Hardin not to grant him a divorce. They finally divorced in 1938.

==Later years==
In the 1930s, sometimes billing herself as &quot;Mrs. Louis Armstrong&quot;, Hardin led an &quot;All Girl Orchestra&quot;, a mixed-sex big band which broadcast nationally over the NBC radio network. In the same decade she recorded for Decca as a swing vocalist and performed as piano accompanist for other singers. She also performed with Red Allen.

==Solo work==
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hardin worked mostly as a soloist, singing and playing piano. In the late 1940s, she decided to leave the music business and become a tailor, so she took a course in tailoring. Her graduation project was to make a tuxedo for Armstrong.

Hardin returned to Chicago and the house on East 41st Street. She made a trip to Europe and had a brief love affair in France, but mostly she worked around Chicago, often with fellow Chicagoans. Collaborators included Red Saunders, Joe Williams, Oscar Brown Jr., and Little Brother Montgomery.

In the 1950s, Hardin recorded a biographical narrative for Bill Grauer at Riverside Records that was issued in LP form. She would again appear on that label in 1961, participating in its project &quot;Chicago: The Living Legends&quot; as accompanist for Alberta Hunter and leader of her own hastily assembled big band. The Riverside recordings led to her inclusion in a 1961 NBC network special, &quot;Chicago and All That Jazz&quot;, and a follow-up album released by Verve. In 1962, she began writing her autobiography with Chris Albertson, but she changed her mind when she realized the book would include experiences that might discomfit Louis Armstrong, so the project was delayed until his death. She died before finishing the book.

==Death==
When Louis Armstrong died in 1971, she traveled to New York for the funeral and rode in the family car. Returning to Chicago, she felt that work on her autobiography could continue, but the following month, performing at a televised memorial concert for Armstrong, she collapsed at the piano and died from a heart attack on the way to the hospital. After her funeral, her letters and the unfinished manuscript of her autobiography disappeared from her house.

She was interred at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, Illinois.

In 2004, the Chicago Park District renamed a community park in her honor.

==Legacy==
Hardin&#x27;s song &quot;Bad Boy&quot; (originally titled &quot;Brown Gal&quot;) was covered by the Jive Bombers (first in 1950 as &quot;Brown Boy&quot;) whose 1956 version was a hit, and by Ringo Starr in 1978 on his seventh album &quot;Bad Boy&quot;.

Armstrong&#x27;s composition &quot;Oriental Swing&quot; was sampled by electro swing musician Parov Stelar to create the 2012 song &quot;Booty Swing&quot;. The song gained notoriety when it was used in a 2013 Chevrolet commercial.

<text>James F. Dunnigan (born August 8, 1943) is an author, military-political analyst, Defense and State Department consultant, and wargame designer currently living in New York City.
==Career==
Dunnigan was born in Rockland County, New York. After high school, he volunteered for the military instead of waiting to be drafted. From 1961 to 1964, he worked as a repair technician for the Sergeant ballistic missile; his service included a tour in Korea. Afterwards, he attended Pace University studying accounting, then transferred to Columbia University, graduating with a degree in history in 1970.

In college he became involved in wargaming. He designed &quot;Jutland&quot;, which Avalon Hill published in 1967, following it up with &quot;1914&quot; the next year, and &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; in 1970, which eventually sold more than 300,000 copies. Meanwhile, Dunnigan had founded his own company, initially known as Poultron Press, and which was soon renamed to Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI). Dunnigan created SPI to save the magazine &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot;, which at that time was published by Chris Wagner. Dunnigan had been contributing material to the magazine since its second issue in February 1967, and when Wagner was having financial challenges with the magazine he sold the rights to Dunningan for $1. Dunnigan took over a windowless basement in the Lower East Side of New York City where he published his first issue, &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; #18 in September 1969; every issue included a new wargame beginning with that issue. Dunnigan also designed the game &quot;Sniper!&quot; (1973). Dunnigan later designed &quot;Dallas: The Television Role-Playing Game&quot; (1980), which was the first published licensed role-playing game. In 1980, Dunnigan was forced to leave SPI as the financial situation at the company was deteriorating. He left SPI to write more books, begin modeling financial markets, and pursue other projects.

Between 1966 and 1992, he designed over 100 wargames and other conflict simulations, ranging from 1969&#x27;s &quot;Up Against the Wall, Motherfucker&quot; about the student takeover at Columbia (which he witnessed as a bystander), to the gigantic &quot;War in Europe&quot;, to the online &quot;Hundred Years War&quot; with his long-time partners Albert Nofi and Daniel Masterson, which has been running since 1992.

In 1979, he wrote &quot;The Complete Wargames Handbook&quot; (first edition), and in 1980 &quot;How to Make War&quot;.

Dunnigan contributed to Three-Sixty Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Victory at Sea&quot; but, he claimed, was not allowed to finish the computer wargame&#x27;s design, although it was advertised as &quot;James F. Dunnigan&#x27;s &quot;Victory at Sea&quot;&quot;. 

With his partners from the &quot;Hundred Years War&quot;, Daniel Masterson and Albert Nofi, Dunnigan founded the online military news site StrategyPage in 1999, of which he is the editor-in-chief. Podcasts of his commentaries on history, military affairs, and the contemporary world are regularly posted on StrategyPage.Com and as at Instapundit.com

Dunnigan regularly lectures at military and academic institutions, such as the Chief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group, in Newport, Rhode Island.

==Awards/recognition==
At Origins in 1976, Dunnigan was inducted into the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame. In 1999 &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named him as one of the millennium&#x27;s most influential persons &quot;at least in the realm of adventure gaming&quot;. He was honored as a &quot;famous game designer&quot; by being featured on the king of diamonds in Flying Buffalo&#x27;s 2008 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.

<doc id="222521" wikidata="Q1188050" url="?curid=222521" title="Treasure (company)">
<text>is a Japanese video game developer based in Tokyo known for its action, platform, and shoot &#x27;em up games. The company was founded in 1992 by former Konami employees seeking to explore original game concepts and free themselves from Konami&#x27;s reliance on sequels. Their first game, &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; (1993) on the Sega Genesis, was a critical success and established a creative and action-oriented design style that would continue to characterize their output. Treasure&#x27;s philosophy in game development has always been to make games they enjoy, not necessarily those that have the greatest commercial viability.

Treasure grew a cult following for their action games developed during the 1990s, and though initially exclusive to Sega platforms, they expanded to other platforms in 1997. The company earned recognition from critics, being called one of the best Japanese indie studios and 2D game developers. The company&#x27;s output decreased in the 2010s, with their most recent release being &quot;Gaist Crusher God&quot; in 2014.

==History==

=== Origins and 16-bit era ===
Treasure founder and president Masato Maegawa dreamed of working in the video game industry when he was young and began learning computer programming in junior high school. He studied programming in college and was hired by developer and publisher Konami after graduating. At Konami, Maegawa and associates that would later establish Treasure worked on a variety of games including arcade titles &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1991) and &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot; (1992), and Super NES games &quot;Super Castlevania IV&quot; (1991), &quot;Contra III: The Alien Wars&quot; (1992), and &quot;Axelay&quot; (1992). In 1991, Maegawa and several other Konami employees began planning an original game that would become &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; (1993)&quot;,&quot; but their concept was rejected by Konami. Maegawa and his team were growing frustrated with Konami&#x27;s growing reliance on sequels to established franchises such as their &quot;Castlevania&quot; and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series. The team felt consumers wanted original games, and so they left Konami in 1992 to establish Treasure and continue development on &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;.
Treasure was founded on June 19, 1992; the company name came from wanting to be a &quot;treasure&quot; to the industry. Around the time of founding, the company had just over ten people. Even though most of the staff made games for the Super NES at Konami, they wanted to develop &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; for the Sega Genesis because the system&#x27;s Motorola 68000 microprocessor was necessary for the visuals and gameplay they were striving for. Treasure approached Sega for a publishing contract. At first, they were not granted approval because they lacked a track record, but Sega instead contracted them to develop &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot; (1993). Several months into development, they were granted approval to work on &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;. Treasure staff was split into two teams to work on both games in parallel. They had a staff of around 18 people at the time, most being ex-Konami programmers. The staff felt they had more freedom working under Sega than Konami.

&quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot; was completed first, but Treasure decided to finish and release &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; first because they wanted their debut to be an original game. North American magazine &quot;GameFan&quot; were enthralled with the game and secured the first English language interview with Treasure that year. &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot; was released next, initiating a trend for Treasure of developing games based on licensed properties. As a small studio, Treasure required the revenue from licensed games to develop original projects. Treasure continued to develop games for the Genesis for the remainder of the 16-bit era because of the system&#x27;s smooth sprite movement, and grew a following among Sega fans. After &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;, Treasure was divided into four teams to develop (in order of release): platformer &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; (1994), fighting game &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho Makyō Tōitsusen&quot; (1994), run and gun &quot;Alien Soldier&quot; (1995), and action-adventure &quot;Light Crusader&quot; (1995). The variety among these games illustrated unevenness and unpredictability in Treasure&#x27;s output that would become characteristic of them.

=== 32-bit era ===
In 1994, Sega introduced the Sega Saturn technology to Treasure. Treasure were impressed with the system&#x27;s ability to handle a large number of sprites. They also knew their fan base consisted entirely of Sega gamers, so as the 32-bit era began, they moved development to the Saturn. Even though the Saturn was capable of 3D graphics, they continued to develop 2D games because they had built up 2D sprite know-how. Competition from 3D games did not concern them. First on Saturn was &quot;Guardian Heroes&quot; (1996), a beat &#x27;em up that combines elements from fighting games and RPGs. Treasure worked on their next two releases concurrently, side-scrolling platformers &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; (1997) and &quot;Silhouette Mirage&quot; (1997). &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; was released on the Nintendo 64 and published by Enix, Treasure&#x27;s first game published by a company other than Sega and released on non-Sega hardware. Treasure chose to develop for the Nintendo 64 because they were interested in the hardware&#x27;s capabilities. Enix had heard of Treasure&#x27;s reputation for action games and requested to publish for them in the past, but it was not until Treasure was developing for a non-Sega platform that they sought Enix&#x27;s cooperation. &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; was followed by &quot;Silhouette Mirage&quot;, which was initially released on the Saturn then ported to the PlayStation in 1998.
In 1998, Treasure released their first arcade game, the shoot &#x27;em up &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;. Treasure had been hesitant to develop an arcade game for years because of concerns with their commercial viability, but the staff felt &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; had potential and they were eager to develop it. The game was ported to the Saturn later that year. Enix published Treasure&#x27;s next game for the PlayStation, fighting game &quot;Rakugaki Showtime&quot; (1999), but had to pull it from shelves shortly after release because of a lawsuit filed against them. This was followed by the multidirectional shooter &quot;Bangai-O&quot; (1999) which received a limited release on the Nintendo 64, but was later modified and re-released for the Dreamcast. By 1999, most of the founding Treasure staff were still with the company.

=== 2000s ===
Treasure began the 2000s with some early troubles. &quot;Gun Beat&quot;, a racing game they were developing for Sega&#x27;s NAOMI arcade platform, was canceled with little explanation. Also, &quot;&quot; (2000) and &quot;Stretch Panic&quot; (2001) for the PlayStation 2 both weren&#x27;t received very well. Despite these hiccups, Treasure did find success with &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot; (2000), a rail shooter co-developed with Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 and later released on the iQue in China. The game was not released in western territories but grew a cult following among import gamers. While &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot; was still in development, Treasure started development on a spiritual sequel to &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; titled &quot;Ikaruga&quot; (2001). The arcade shooter was co-developed with G.rev, and ported to the Dreamcast and saw a worldwide release on the GameCube.

Treasure next embarked on a series of licensed projects. Two of these were based on the &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; franchise, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster&#x27;s Bad Dream&quot; (2002) for the Game Boy Advance and the unreleased &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe&quot; for the PlayStation 2. Other licensed games during this period included Game Boy Advance games &quot;Hajime no Ippo: The Fighting!&quot; (2003) and &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot; (2003), as well as GameCube games &quot;Wario World&quot; (2003) and &quot;Dragon Drive: D-Masters Shot&quot; (2003). &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot; was co-developed with Hitmaker and was critically praised for returning to Treasure&#x27;s classic side-scrolling action style that had been missing from their recent output. Their next game was &quot;Gradius V&quot; (2004) which like &quot;Ikaruga&quot; before it, was co-developed with G.rev. The companies worked under contract for Konami, and the game helped cement Treasure&#x27;s return to critical successes following a slew of mediocre licensed games.

Treasure developed sequels on the Game Boy Advance for their earlier successes, &quot;Advance Guardian Heroes&quot; (2004) and &quot;Gunstar Super Heroes&quot; (2005). Treasure followed this with a series of licensed &quot;Bleach&quot; games for the Nintendo DS. Maegawa explained that his company experiences challenges in developing games based on licensed properties like &quot;Bleach&quot;, saying that the staff wants to be original but cannot detract too far from the source material and risk disappointing fans. By 2009, the company had 20-30 employees.

=== 2010s ===
The number of employees at Treasure had dropped to 16 by 2011. In a 2011 interview, Maegawa explained that Treasure now uses middleware to develop games, no longer using custom programming to push the hardware to their maximum levels. The company was also putting an increased focus on rereleasing their back catalog as downloadable games on the Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live. Treasure has not released any new games since 2014 apart from re-releases of games like &quot;Ikaruga&quot;. 

=== 2020s ===
On June 19, 2022, its 30th anniversary, Treasure announced it was working on a &quot;highly requested&quot; game. They had less than 10 staff by 2022.

==Staff and design philosophy==
Treasure does not have a rigid hierarchy. Maegawa explained that Treasure operates differently from other companies by not assigning lead designers. While a project leader may create a project plan, most of the game design is done collaboratively between the programmers and artists. Most permanent employees and part-time contractors drift in and out of projects as required. Some individuals have been important figures in Treasure&#x27;s history:

* Masato Maegawa – Founder, company president, and lead producer on all games. He was programmer for some of the company&#x27;s Genesis games.
* Hideyuki Suganami – Programmer on &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;, &quot;Alien Soldier&quot;, &quot;Mischief Makers&quot;, and &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot;. Suganami has left the company but worked as a freelancer on &quot;Gunstar Super Heroes&quot; and &quot;Sin and Punishment: Star Successor&quot;.
* Hiroshi Iuchi – Director for &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;, &quot;Ikaruga&quot;, and &quot;Gradius V&quot;
* Mitsuru Yaida – Programmer for the &quot;Bangai-O&quot; games
* Koichi Kimura - Director and Artist for &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot;, &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot;, &quot;Stretch Panic&quot;, and &quot;Wario World&quot;
* Tetsuhiko Kikuchi – Frequent artist and character designer. Led development of &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho Makyō Tōitsusen&quot;, &quot;Guardian Heroes&quot;, &quot;Rakugaki Showtime&quot; and &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe&quot;.
* Norio Hanzawa – Frequent composer
* Yasushi Suzuki – Artist for &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;, &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot;, and &quot;Ikaruga&quot;

Treasure places emphasis on creating original games in the action, platform, and shooter genres. They do not have a preference on gaming platforms or 2D vs. 3D gameplay, preferring to choose the most suitable depending on the game they are designing. The company has never viewed sales as much of a concern. They would prefer making the games they want to make, and not what will more likely sell well. Maegawa has preferred to always keep the company small to keep an &quot;independent-minded&quot; mentality, and help the developers&#x27; personalities shine through their games.

They expressed disinterest in sequels early in their history, but became more open to it later. They pride themselves in creating original ideas and avoiding imitating other works or being associated with games already on the market. They have made games based on licensed properties to generate revenue to pursue original projects. Explaining the Treasure design philosophy, Maegawa said it &quot;simply, to create the games we want to make&quot; and &quot;creating the things we love in the way we like.&quot; The company has generally employed around 20 to 30 people at any given time.

== Reputation ==
Treasure was one of the most celebrated developers of the 16-bit era and grew a cult following during the period. &quot;USgamer&quot; called them &quot;one of Japan&#x27;s pioneering indie developers&quot; and explained the &quot;sense of integrity&quot; in their 1990s work that was not seen in other games of the era. &quot;Maximum: The Video Game Magazine&quot; called them &quot;one of the most respected programming houses in the world&quot; in 1996. &quot;Gamers&#x27; Republic&quot; agreed in 1998, writing: &quot;Any action or platform gamer worth his salt recognizes Treasure as one of the finest development houses in the world.&quot; In 2005, &quot;1UP.com&quot; called Treasure &quot;one of Japan&#x27;s most famous independent development houses [...] releasing some of the most finely crafted, creative, and offbeat action games the world has ever seen.&quot; Treasure did not have any large commercial successes, which influenced &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; to describe their output as &quot;critically acclaimed yet commercially unsuccessful.&quot; Because of the loyal fan base but low sales, prices of Treasure games such as &quot;Rakugaki Showtime&quot; and &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; have climbed on the secondary market.

The company established a signature style early on that became consistent across their work. Their first game, &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;, established what &quot;1UP.com&quot; called Treasure&#x27;s key themes: &quot;creativity, weirdness, and a tendency toward completely absurd levels of action.&quot; &quot;Wireframe&quot; called their style &quot;fast, aggressive [...] featuring bold graphics and surreal dashes of humour.&quot; &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; wrote that they have &quot;consistently excellent art direction&quot; and are renowned for their &quot;action-packed&quot; and &quot;explosive&quot; gameplay. They explained that Treasure is &quot;at the very cutting edge of artistic freedom, forging its own very particular path and creating a softography guided by nothing other than the whims of the creators.&quot; The company is known for taking risks within established genres, borrowing conventional ideas and adding their own creative touches to create something new and innovative. They became recognized for their prowess in 2D game design, with &quot;Gamers&#x27; Republic&quot; calling their output &quot;the finest 2D platform games on the planet.&quot; Treasure is also known for technological innovation; several of their games pushed the hardware to their limits.

<text>is the term for a traditionally-made Japanese blade (日本刀; nihontō) in the form of a spear, or more specifically, the straight-headed spear. The martial art of wielding the is called .

==History==
The forerunner of the is thought to be a derived from a Chinese spear. These are thought to be from the Nara period (710–794).

The term appeared for the first time in written sources in 1334, but this type of spear did not become popular until the late 15th century. The original warfare of the was not a thing for commoners; it was a ritualized combat usually between two warriors who would challenge each other via horseback archery. In the late Heian period, battles on foot began to increase and , a bladed polearm, became a main weapon along with a &quot;yumi&quot; (longbow).

The attempted Mongol invasions of Japan in 1274 and 1281 was one of the factors that changed Japanese weaponry and warfare. The Mongols employed Chinese and Korean footmen wielding long pikes and fought in tight formations. They moved in large units to stave off cavalry. Polearms (including and ) were of much greater military use than swords, due to their significantly longer reach, lighter weight per unit length (though overall a polearm would be fairly hefty), and their great piercing ability.

In the Nanbokuchō period, battles on foot by groups became the mainstream and the importance of further increased, but were not yet the main weapon. However, after the Onin War in 15th century in the Muromachi period, large-scale group battles started in which mobilized (foot peasant troops) fought on foot and in close quarters, and &quot;yari&quot;, (longbow) and (Japanese matchlock) became the main weapons. This made and obsolete on the battlefield, and they were often replaced with and short, lightweight .
Around the latter half of the 16th century, holding pikes () with length of became the main forces in armies. They formed lines, combined with soldiers bearing firearms &quot;tanegashima&quot; and short spears. Pikemen formed a two- or three-row line, and were trained to move their pikes in unison under command. Not only but also samurai fought on the battlefield with &quot;yari&quot; as one of their main weapons. For example, Honda Tadakatsu was famous as a master of one of The Three Great Spears of Japan, the &quot;Tonbokiri&quot; (蜻蛉切). One of The Three Great Spears of Japan, the &quot;Nihongō&quot; (:ja:日本号) was treasured as a gift, and its ownership changed to Emperor Ogimachi, Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Fukushima Masanori, and so on, and has been handed down to the present day.

With the coming of the Edo period the had fallen into disuse. Greater emphasis was placed on small-scale, close quarters combat, so the convenience of swords led to their dominance, and polearms and archery lost their practical value. During the peaceful Edo period, were still produced (sometimes even by renowned swordsmiths), although they existed mostly as either a ceremonial weapon or as a police weapon.

==Description==

 were characterized by a straight blade that could be anywhere from several centimeters to or more in length. The blades were made of the same steel () from which traditional Japanese swords and arrowheads were forged, and were very durable. Throughout history many variations of the straight blade were produced, often with protrusions on a central blade. blades often had an extremely long tang (; 中心); typically it would be longer than the sharpened portion of the blade. The tang protruded into a reinforced hollow portion of the handle ( or ) resulting in a very stiff shaft making it nearly impossible for the blade to fall or break off.

The shaft ( or ) came in many different lengths, widths, and shapes; made of hardwood and covered in lacquered bamboo strips, these came in oval, round, or polygonal cross section. These in turn were often wrapped in metal rings or wire (), and affixed with a metal pommel (; 石突) on the butt end. shafts were often decorated with inlays of metal or semiprecious materials such as brass pins, lacquer, or flakes of pearl. A sheath (; 鞘) was also part of a complete .

==Variations of blades==

Various types of points or blades existed. The most common blade was a straight, flat design that resembles a straight-bladed double edged dagger. This type of blade could cut as well as stab and was sharpened like a razor edge. Though is a catchall term for &#x27;spear&#x27;, it is usually distinguished between , which have additional horizontal blades, and simple () or straight spears. can also be distinguished by the types of blade cross section: the triangular sections were called and the diamond sections were called .
* have a point that resembles a narrow spike with a triangular cross-section. A therefore had no cutting edge, only a sharp point at the end. The was therefore best suited for penetrating armor, even armor made of metal, which a standard yari was not as suited to. There are two types of : , blades with a triangular, equilateral cross section, and , with a triangular, isosceles-shaped cross section.
* , a blade with a diamond shaped cross section.
* were mounted to a shaft by means of a metal socket instead of a tang. The socket and blade are forged from a single piece.
* were one of the rarest types of , possessing only a single edge. This created a weapon that could be used for hacking and closely resembled a . are the only which use a .
* had a very broad, &quot;spade-shaped&quot; head. often had a pair of holes centering the two ovoid halves.

* , also called , looked something similar to a trident or partisan, and brandishing two curved side blades pointing upward. It is occasionally referred to as in modern weaponry texts.
** , a with one side blade pointing downward and one side blade pointing upward.
** , a with the two side blades pointing downward.
** , a with the two side blades resembling a pair of buffalo horns.
* gets its name from a peasant weapon or tool called (lit. &quot;sickle&quot; or &quot;scythe&quot;). 

* had a weapon design sporting a blade that was two-pronged. Instead of being constructed like a military fork, a straight blade (as in ) was intersected just below its midsection by a perpendicular blade. This blade was slightly shorter than the primary, had curved tips making a parallelogram, and was set off center so that only 1/6 of its length extended on the other side. This formed a rough &#x27;L&#x27; shape.
* barely looked like a spear at all. A polearm that had a crescent blade for a spearhead, which could be used for slashing and hooking.
* was a key-shaped spear with a long blade with a side hook much like that found on a fauchard. This could be used to catch another weapon, or even dismount a rider mounted on horseback.
* possessed some of the most ornate designs for any spear. Running parallel to the long central blade were two &#x27;crescent moon&#x27; shaped blades facing outwards. They were attached in two locations by short cross bars, making the head look somewhat like a fleur-de-lis.
* , an old form of possibly from the Nara period (710–794), a guard&#x27;s spear with pole and blade either leaf-shaped or waved (like keris); a sickle-shaped horn projected on one or both sides at the joint of blade. The had a hollow socket like the later period for the pole to fit into rather than a long tang.
* , a broad described as being &quot;leaf shaped&quot; or &quot;bamboo leaf shaped&quot;.
* (alao known as ), a straight double edged blade.
* (), an extra long blade.
* 

==Variations of shafts==
A shaft can range in length from , with some in excess of 6 metres.

* : long, a type of pike used by . It was especially used by Oda clan beginning from the reign of Oda Nobunaga; samurai tradition of the time held that the soldiers of the rural province of Owari were among the weakest in Japan. Kantō was a chaotic place; Kansai was home to the Shogunate, and the Uesugi, Takeda, Imagawa, and Hojo clans, as well as pirate raiders from Shikoku. Additionally, Kyushu was home of one of the most warmongering clans in Japan, the Shimazu clan. Because of this, Nobunaga armed his underperforming soldiers extra-long pikes in order for them to be more effective against armoured opponents and cavalry, and fighting in groups and formations.
* , a long spear used by and samurai.
* . The shaft goes through a hollow metal tube that allowed the spear to be twisted during thrusting. This style of is typified in the school .
* . A with a short simple shaft that was kept by the bedside for home protection.
* . A with a short shaft that was used by samurai and police to help capture criminals.

<text>The polka-mazurka is a dance, musically similar to the mazurka, but danced much like the polka. Many polka-mazurkas were composed by Johann Strauss II and his family. Johann Strauss I did not compose any of this type of music; the first polka-mazurka example written by the Strauss family was in the year 1854 by Johann Strauss II, entitled La Viennoise op. 144.The polka-mazurka was not credited to the Strauss family alone, as many Viennese composers in the 1850s era also wrote many examples. This variant of the polka was seen as cross-cultural, as many of its influences can be seen in the French-polka with its feminine and deliberate steps as well as the exciting schnell-polka, where Eduard Strauss composed many famous pieces of this type.

==Polka-mazurka music==
Its tempo of 3 beats to the bar ( time) meant that it was similar in rhythm to the waltz, but the emphasis of the polka-mazurka was on the first beat of the bar as opposed to the waltz which places its beats on the last two as epitomised by the Viennese waltz with its heavily accentuated final two beats to the bar.

The polka-mazurka does possess a similar structure to the polka, with a main theme quickly proceeding to its subsidiary theme which is usually brash and loudly played. The &#x27;trio&#x27; section is free-style and need not associate with the main theme nor of the same key signature. The Strauss family, Josef Strauss in particular, attempted in most of his famous polka-mazurkas to blend in sensitivity and romanticism, as can be heard in his pieces Sympathie op. 73, and Frauenherz op. 166, which were inspired by his concern for social issues faced by women in that era.

<text>The Mazurka (Polish: &quot;mazurek&quot;) is a Polish musical form based on stylised folk dances in triple meter, usually at a lively tempo, with character defined mostly by the prominent mazur&#x27;s &quot;strong accents unsystematically placed on the second or third beat&quot;. The Mazurka, alongside the polka dance, became popular at the ballrooms and salons of Europe in the 19th century, particularly through the notable works by Frédéric Chopin. The mazurka (in Polish &quot;mazur&quot;, the same word as the mazur) and mazurek (rural dance based on the mazur) are often confused in Western literature as the same musical form.

== History ==
The folk origins of the &quot;Mazurk&quot; are three Polish folk dances which are:

* &quot;mazur&quot;, most characteristic due to its inconsistent rhythmic accents,
* slow and melancholic &quot;kujawiak&quot;,
* fast &quot;oberek&quot;.

The &quot;mazurka&quot; is always found to have either a triplet, trill, dotted eighth note (quaver) pair, or an ordinary eighth note pair before two quarter notes (crotchets). In the 19th century, the form became popular in many ballrooms in different parts of Europe.

&quot;Mazurka&quot; is a Polish word, it means a Masovian woman or girl. It is a feminine form of the word &quot;Mazur&quot;, which — until the nineteenth century — denoted an inhabitant of Poland&#x27;s Mazovia region (Masovians, formerly plural: &quot;Mazurzy&quot;). The similar word &quot;Mazurek&quot; is a diminutive and masculine form of &quot;Mazur&quot;. In relation to dance, all these words (&quot;mazur, mazurek, mazurka&quot;) mean &quot;a Mazovian dance&quot;. Apart from the ethnic name, the word &quot;mazurek&quot; refers to various terms in Polish, e.g. a cake, a bird and a popular surname. 

&quot;Mazurek&quot; is also a rural dance identified by some as the &quot;oberek&quot;. It is said &quot;oberek&quot; is a danced variation of the sung &quot;mazurek&quot;, the latter also having more prominent accents on second and third beats and less fluent of a rhythmical flow, which is so characteristical of &quot;oberek.&quot;

Several classical composers have written mazurkas, with the best known being the 59 composed by Frédéric Chopin for solo piano. In 1825, Maria Szymanowska wrote the largest collection of piano mazurkas published before Chopin. Henryk Wieniawski also wrote two for violin with piano (the popular &quot;Obertas&quot;, Op. 19), Julian Cochran composed a collection of five mazurkas for solo piano and orchestra, and in the 1920s, Karol Szymanowski wrote a set of twenty for piano and finished his composing career with a final pair in 1934. Alexander Scriabin, who was at first conscious of being Chopin&#x27;s follower, wrote 24 mazurkas.

Chopin first started composing mazurkas in 1824, reaching full maturity by 1830, the year of the November Uprising, a rebellion in Congress Poland against Russia. Chopin continued composing them until 1849, the year of his death. The stylistic and musical characteristics of his mazurkas differ from the traditional variety because Chopin in effect created a more complex type of mazurka , using classical techniques, including counterpoint and fugue. By including more chromaticism and harmony in the mazurkas, he made them more technically interesting than the traditional dances. Chopin also tried to compose his mazurkas in such a way that they could not be used for dancing, so as to distance them from the original form.

However, while Chopin changed some aspects of the original mazurka, he maintained others. His mazurkas, like the traditional dances, contain a great deal of repetition: repetition of certain measures or groups of measures; of entire sections; and of an initial theme. The rhythm of his mazurkas also remains very similar to that of earlier mazurkas. However, Chopin also incorporated the rhythmic elements of the two other Polish forms mentioned above, the &quot;kujawiak&quot; and &quot;oberek&quot;; his mazurkas usually feature rhythms from more than one of these three forms (&quot;mazurek&quot;, &quot;kujawiak&quot;, and &quot;oberek&quot;). This use of rhythm suggests that Chopin tried to create a genre that had ties to the original form, but was still something new and different.

The mazurka began as a dance for either four or eight couples. Eventually, Michel Fokine created a female solo mazurka dance dominated by flying &quot;grandes jetés&quot;, alternating second and third arabesque positions, and split-leg climactic postures.

== Outside Poland ==

The form was common as a popular dance in Europe and the United States in the mid to late nineteenth century.

===Cape Verde Islands===
In Cape Verde the mazurka is also revered as an important cultural phenomenon played with acoustic bands led by a violinist and accompanied by guitarists.
It also takes a variation of the mazurka dance form and is found mostly in the north of the archipelago, mainly in São Nicolau, Santo Antão. In the south it finds popularity in the island of Brava.

===Czechia===
Czech composers Bedřich Smetana, Antonín Dvořák, and Bohuslav Martinů all wrote mazurkas to at least some extent. For Smetana and Martinů, these are single pieces (respectively, a Mazurka-Cappricio for piano and a Mazurka-Nocturne for a mixed string/wind quartet), whereas Dvořák composed a set of six mazurkas for piano, and a mazurka for violin and orchestra.

===France===
In France, Impressionistic composers Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel both wrote mazurkas; Debussy&#x27;s is a stand-alone piece, and Ravel&#x27;s is part of a suite of an early work, &quot;La Parade&quot;. Jacques Offenbach included a mazurka in his ballet &quot;Gaîté Parisienne&quot;; Léo Delibes composed one which appears several times in the first act of his ballet &quot;Coppélia&quot;. The mazurka appears frequently in French traditional folk music. In the French Antilles, the mazurka has become an important style of dance and music.

A creolised version of the mazurka is &quot;mazouk&quot; which—beginning around 1979 in Paris—morphed into the globally popular dance style “zouk” developed in France and popularised by Paris&#x27;s Island-creole supergroup Kassav&#x27;; &quot;mazouk&quot; had been introduced to the French Caribbean in the late 1800s. In the 21st century in Brazil and the Afro-Caribbean diaspora, &quot;zouk&quot; (and its progenitor band Kassav&#x27;) remains very popular. In popular 20th century folk dancing in France, the Polish/classical-piano (see Chopin) &quot;mazurka&quot; evolved into &quot;mazouk&quot;, a dance at a more gentle pace (without the traditional &#x27;hop&#x27; step on the 3rd beat), fostering more-intimate dancing and associating mazouk with a &quot;seduction&quot; dance (see also tango from Argentina). This &quot;sexy&quot; style of mazurka has also been imported to “balfolk&quot; dancing in Belgium and the Netherlands, hence the name &quot;Belgian Mazurka&quot; or &quot;Flemish Mazurka&quot;. Perhaps the most enduring style of intimate dancing music of this origin moved &quot;zouk&quot; from the 1980s–2000s into its wildly popular (especially in Brazil and Africa) slow-dancing variant called &quot;zouk love&quot;, which remains a staple of French-Caribbean dance venues in Paris and elsewhere.

===Ireland===
Mazurkas constitute a distinctive part of the traditional dance music of County Donegal, Ireland. As a couple&#x27;s dance, it is no longer popular. The Polish dance entered Ireland in the 1840s, but is not widely played outside of Donegal. Unlike the Polish mazurek, which may have an accent on the second or third beat of a bar, the Irish mazurka (&quot;masúrca&quot; in the Irish language) is consistently accented on the second beat, giving it a unique feel. Musician Caoimhín Mac Aoidh has written a book on the subject, &quot;From Mazovia to Meenbanad: The Donegal Mazurkas&quot;, in which the history of the musical and dance form is related. Mac Aoidh tracked down 32 different mazurkas as played in Ireland.

===Italy===

Mazurkas are part of Italian popular music including the Liscio style. Typical of Italian mazurkas are groups of triplets, strong dotted rhythms, and phrase endings of two accented quarter notes and a rest, unlike a waltz.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the composer Ernesto Nazareth wrote a Chopinesque mazurka called &quot;Mercedes&quot; in 1917. Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote a mazurka for classical guitar in a similar musical style to Polish mazurkas.

===Cuba===
In Cuba, composer Ernesto Lecuona wrote a piece titled &quot;Mazurka en Glisado&quot; for the piano, one of various commissions throughout his life.

===Nicaragua===
In Nicaragua, Carlos Mejía Godoy y los de Palacaguina and Los Soñadores de Saraguasca made a compilation of mazurkas from popular folk music, which are performed with a violin de talalate, an indigenous instrument from Nicaragua.

===Curaçao===
In Curaçao the mazurka was popular as dance music in the nineteenth century, as well as in the first half of the twentieth century. Several Curaçao-born composers, such as Jan Gerard Palm, Joseph Sickman Corsen, Jacobo Palm, Rudolph Palm and Wim Statius Muller, have written mazurkas.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, composers Ricardo Castro and Manuel M Ponce wrote mazurkas for the piano in a Chopin fashion, eventually mixing elements of Mexican folk dances.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the mazurka is a popular form of traditional dance. The Mazurka Boholana is one well-known Filipino mazurka.

===Portugal===
In Portugal the mazurka became one of the most popular traditional European dances through the first years of the annual Andanças, a traditional dances festival held nearby Castelo de Vide.

===Russia===
In Russia, many composers wrote mazurkas for solo piano: Scriabin (26), Balakirev (7), Tchaikovsky (6). Borodin wrote two in his &quot;Petite Suite&quot; for piano; Mikhail Glinka also wrote two, although one is a simplified version of Chopin&#x27;s Mazurka No. 13. Tchaikovsky also included mazurkas in his scores for &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Morceaux de salon Op. 10 includes a Mazurka in D-flat major as its 7th piece.

The mazurka was a common dance at the balls of the Russian Empire and it is depicted in many Russian novels and films. In addition to its mention in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; as well as in a protracted episode in &quot;War and Peace&quot;, the dance is prominently featured in Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s novel &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;. Arkady reserves the mazurka for Madame Odintsov with whom he is falling in love. During Russian balls, it was danced elegantly and famously by the Tsarina Maria Feodorovna, the second-to-last tsarina of the Russian empire before its collapse in 1918.

===Sweden===
In Swedish folk music, the quaver or eight-note polska has a similar rhythm to the mazurka, and the two dances have a common origin. The international version of the mazurka was also introduced under that name during the nineteenth century.

===United States===
The mazurka survives in some old-time fiddle tunes, and also in early Cajun music, though it has largely fallen out of Cajun music now. In the Southern United States it was sometimes known as a &quot;mazuka&quot;. Polish Mazurka was danced in upstate New York in the 1950s and 1960s (similarly to the krakowiak, millennium of Christianity) in Polish community centers or social clubs, which can be found throughout the US. The polka remains the best known dance of the Nation of Poland and its people and is regularly danced at weddings, dance halls and public events (e.g., summers outdoors, barn dances) in US. 

====California====
In addition to being part of the repertoire of Irish traditional music sessions, the mazurka has been played by a wide variety of cultural groups in California. The mazurka first came to Alta California during the Spanish period and danced among Californios. Later, the renowned guitarist Manuel Y. Ferrer, who was born in Baja California to Spanish parents and learned guitar from a Franciscan friar in Santa Barbara but made his career in the San Francisco Bay Area, arranged mazurkas for the guitar. During the early 20th century, the mazurka became part of the repertoire of Italian American musicians in San Francisco playing in the &quot;ballo liscio&quot; style. Pianist Sid LeProtti, an important Oakland-born early jazz musician on the west coast, stated that before jazz took off, he and other musicians in Barbary Coast clubs played mazurkas in addition to waltzes, two-steps, marches, polkas, and schottisches. One mazurka, played on harmonica, was collected by Sidney Robertson Cowell for the WPA California Folk Music Project in 1939 in Tuolumne County.

<text>Fierce Creatures is a 1997 farcical comedy film. While not literally a sequel, &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; is a spiritual successor to the 1988 film &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;. Both films star John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; was written by John Cleese and directed by Robert Young and Fred Schepisi. The film was dedicated to Gerald Durrell and Peter Cook. Some scenes were filmed at Jersey Zoo, a zoological park founded by Durrell.

==Plot==

Willa Weston arrives in Atlanta to take a high-ranking position in a company recently acquired by Octopus Inc.&#x27;s owner, Rod McCain. When he informs her he has already sold the company, she then agrees to run another recent acquisition, Marwood Zoo. She is to create a business model that can be used for multiple zoos in the future. Rod McCain&#x27;s son Vincent, who is attracted to Willa, announces that he will join her at the zoo. The zoo&#x27;s newly appointed director is a retired Hong Kong Police Force officer and former Octopus Television employee, Rollo Lee. To meet Octopus&#x27;s revenue target of 20% from all assets, he institutes a &quot;fierce creatures&quot; theme. Believing dangerous and violent animals will attract more visitors, all animals not meeting those requirements must go. 

All the animal keepers, including spider-handler Bugsy, try to change Rollo&#x27;s mind. One such attempt involves getting him to kill some of the cutest animals himself, but Rollo sees through their prank and fakes the animals&#x27; extermination. He keeps the animals in his bedroom which later causes Willa and Vincent to believe he is having an orgy with female staff. Rollo discovers that several staff members are faking animal attack injuries. He fires several warning shots at those responsible and Reggie rushes in, believing that one of them is shot. Rollo then finds a visitor who has had a genuine accident but, not believing it is real, tastes her blood whilst loudly proclaiming that it is fake. Willa and Vincent, upon seeing this fiasco, demote Rollo to middle management. Vince even threatens to fire him if he does not cease his apparent activities with the female staff.

Vince covers both the zoo and animals alike with advertisements after garnering sponsors, dresses the staff in ridiculous outfits, and installs an artificial panda in one of the enclosures. His continued attempts to seduce Willa fail, while she comes to enjoy working at the zoo after connecting with a silverback gorilla. Willa finds herself attracted to Rollo after becoming fascinated by his apparent ability to attract multiple women. When he tries to discuss Vince&#x27;s marketing plan, she suggests dinner, but she postpones when she remembers Rod is coming from Atlanta to discuss the running of the zoo.

Worried that the visit might be part of a plan to close the zoo, Rollo and the zookeepers bug Rod&#x27;s hotel room to find out. Although the plan goes awry, they discover he wants to sell it to Japanese investors who&#x27;ll turn it into a golf course. Also, he plans to have himself cryogenically frozen whenever he gets ill so Vince would never inherit anything. Discovering Vince has stolen sponsorship money he raised, Willa warns him to return it, or she will tell Rod. As Rollo attempts to work out how the theft can be traced, he and Willa finally kiss, just as Vince arrives to return the money. A confrontation then ensues as Willa, Rollo, Bugsy, and several others attempt to stop Vince from running off with the money. 

Rod arrives just as Vince, who is holding a gun, is being subdued and announces the police are on their way to arrest him for stealing. Vince tries and fails to shoot his father, but then Bugsy takes the pistol and accidentally shoots Rod between the eyes. In the panic that follows, a plan emerges to fool Neville, Rod&#x27;s business associate, and the arriving police. The keepers work together to dress Vince up as Rod, as he can imitate his father&#x27;s accent fairly well. When they arrive, Vince (as Rod) tells them that he has rewritten the will, specifying that the zoo will become a trust for the caretakers while Vince will inherit everything else, and he asks all of them to be witnesses. 

After signing the new will, Vince locks himself in a caretaker hut where they fake Rod&#x27;s suicide. Although Neville becomes suspicious, he is left dumbstruck when he finds his boss&#x27;s dead body in the hut. Now free, the zookeepers destroy the evidence of McCain&#x27;s ownership. Vince becomes the new CEO of Octopus, while Willa and Rollo happily begin a new life together while continuing to run the zoo.

==Production==
The movie was based on a sketch written by Palin and Terry Jones in 1967 for &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; about a zoo that is taken over by a man who just wants to stock it with dangerous animals. Cleese began writing the script in 1992 and shooting began on 15 May 1995. The first director was Robert Young who had previously made commercials with Cleese. The film was completed in August 1995 and previewed in November of that year. Palin recorded in his diary:
No shortage of laughter, and it was good and consistent too, right through the first 50 minutes of the movie. Then it began to sag as the plot became more convoluted and just about everything to do with Kevin’s Vince McCain character failed — especially exposing himself to the tiger. But there were good moments, well received, right up to the end.

Preview audiences expressed dissatisfaction with the ending, and in February 1996 the decision was made to reshoot the ending and some other sequences. These additional scenes could not be shot until August 1996 because of the availability of the cast, in particular Palin who was making &quot;Full Circle with Michael Palin&quot;. Corbett later recalled:
Filming &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; was a struggle from the start. There is always a sort of gloom and a feeling of unease on a film set when the words are not quite right, and, in this case, there were too many good people in the film with not enough for them to do. It was difficult for the director Robert Young because everyone was coming up with new ideas all the time and trying to give him guidance... When it was first edited they realised that it was just not right at all.

Cleese and Johnstone worked on a new ending with William Goldman. The delay meant that director Robert Young was busy on pre-production for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, so Cleese hired Fred Schepisi, with whom he had been discussing making a version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. The reshoots took five weeks and cost $7 million. Schepisi claims he tried to get the producers to take out the opening 15 minutes, which was done for a test screening, but then some of this footage was put back in, which Schepisi thought killed the movie.

Lindsay wrote in his memoirs: &quot;Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline, who are both fantastic people, had tough American lawyers and agents around them throughout the shoot and were able to dictate changes to their benefit and to our detriment.&quot; Corbett recalled that Schepisi &quot;was full of confidence and imagination, but even then it didn’t really turn out right — which confirmed my theory that there is a limit to the amount of tweaking you can do on these occasions.&quot;

In November, Palin wrote: &quot;Word is that the Monday screening and ‘focus group’ out on Long Island didn’t go well. Only 58% returned the good to very good. Fred [Schepisi] then edited out ten minutes that weren’t working and scores went up by 15% on the Wednesday screening. So, after all these years of time, energy, money and hard graft, &quot;FC&quot; looks likely to be a 90-minute quickie, its shape and content decided eventually by 20 people in Long Island. JC’s ‘message’ scenes — all his indignation at the system, his invective against the modem management style — have virtually disappeared.&quot; When Palin saw the film in December he wrote &quot;It’s a short film now — 93 minutes — stripped of all pretensions, and generally honed to comedy scenes that deliver good farce and well-hit one-liners. It’s a solid, aggressive piece of work. Kevin and Jamie attack; John defends well; and I’m quite sidelined, stuck amongst the keepers. The keepers collective in &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; fulfils the same sort of role as Ken Pile in &quot;Wanda&quot;.&quot;

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 53% based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 5.58/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads &quot;&quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; reunites &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;&#x27;s talented ensemble for a comedy that, while not without its moments, suffers from diminishing returns&quot;. Roger Ebert awarded the film two and a half out of four stars, and compared it unfavourably to &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;, stating: &quot;It lacks the hair-trigger timing, the headlong rush into comic illogic, that made &quot;Wanda&quot; so special.&quot;

The film grossed $9 million in the United States and Canada, £4 million ($7 million) in the United Kingdom and $24 million in the rest of the world, for a worldwide total of $40 million. Cleese has since stated that following up &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; with a second film had been a mistake. When asked in 2008 by his friend, director and restaurant critic Michael Winner what he would do differently if he could live his life again, Cleese responded: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have married Alyce Faye Eichelberger and I wouldn&#x27;t have made &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;.&quot;

According to Palin, Kline told him &quot;the problem was that John is at his best when creating awful people (Fawlty, Otto, etc.) and least convincing when trying to write warm, friendly, decent ones (his own character as Archie in Wanda an exception). I think he’s right. John is happiest when he’s on the attack. And funniest too.&quot;

<doc id="222536" wikidata="Q203478" url="?curid=222536" title="Polonaise">
<text>The polonaise (, ; , ) is a dance originating in Poland, and one of the five Polish national dances in time. The original Polish-language name of the dance is &quot;chodzony&quot; (), denoting a walking dance. It is one of the finest dances representing Poland&#x27;s cultural dance tradition. The polonaise dance influenced European ballrooms, folk music and European classical music. 

The polonaise has a rhythm quite close to that of the Swedish semiquaver or sixteenth-note polska, and the two dances share a common origin. Polska dance was introduced to Sweden during the period of the Vasa dynasty and the Polish–Swedish union.

The polonaise is a very popular dance uninterruptedly danced in Poland till today. It is the opening dance in all major official balls and events, at New Year&#x27;s balls, on national days as well as various less official parties. The polonaise is always the first dance at a &quot;studniówka&quot; (&quot;student ball&quot;), the Polish equivalent of the senior prom that occurs approximately 100 days before exams, hence its name &quot;studniówka&quot; or literally in Polish &quot;the ball of the hundred days&quot;.

In 2023, the dance was included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists being recognized as &quot;a form of joint celebration&quot;, which &quot;commemorates important moments in family and community life and symbolizes cooperation, reconciliation and equality.&quot;

==Influence of Polonaise in music==
The notation &quot;alla polacca&quot; ( means &quot;polonaise&quot;) on a musical score indicates that the piece should be played with the rhythm and character of a polonaise. For example, the third movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Triple Concerto op. 56, marked &quot;Rondo alla polacca,&quot; the last movement in Weber&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto No. 2 is marked &quot;Alla Polacca&quot;, his Horn Concertino likewise ends with a polka movement, and the finale of Chopin&#x27;s Variations on &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot; both feature this notation. In his book &quot;Classic Music: Expression, Form, and Style&quot;, Leonard G. Ratner cites the fourth movement from Beethoven&#x27;s Serenade in D major, Op. 8, marked &quot;Allegretto alla Polacca,&quot; as a representative example of the polonaise dance topic (Ratner 1980, pp. 12–13).

Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s polonaises are generally the best known of all polonaises in classical music. But there was a long tradition of polonaise in European music at least 100 years before Chopin. Händel wrote a famous one, and Wilhelm Fiedemann Bach wrote a number of beautiful ones in major minor pairs.Other composers who wrote polonaises or pieces in polonaise rhythm include Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Georg Philipp Telemann, Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Danzi, Bernhard Henrik Crusell, Karol Kurpiński, Józef Elsner, Maria Agata Szymanowska, Henryk Wieniawski, Franz Schubert, Carl Maria von Weber, Clara Schumann, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johann Kaspar Mertz, Moritz Moszkowski, Modest Mussorgsky, Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Alexander Scriabin.

Another more recent prolific polonaise composer was the American Edward Alexander MacDowell.

John Philip Sousa wrote the &quot;Presidential Polonaise&quot;, intended to keep visitors moving briskly through the White House receiving line. Sousa wrote it in 1886 after a suggestion from President Chester A. Arthur. 

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, an adaption of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s novel in poetry verse, includes a famous polonaise.

==National dance==
The polonaise is a Polish dance and is one of the five historic national dances of Poland. The others are the Mazur (Mazurka), Kujawiak, Krakowiak and Oberek. Polonaise originated as a peasant dance known under various names – &quot;chodzony&quot; (&quot;pacer&quot;), &quot;chmielowy&quot; (&quot;hops&quot;), &quot;pieszy&quot; (&quot;walker&quot;) or &quot;wielki&quot; (&quot;great&quot;), recorded as early as the 15th century. In later centuries, it gained popularity among the urban population and the nobles. By the late 16th century, the folk versions of polonaise (accompanied by singing) were commonly danced by the lower Polish nobility, but the dance was not known under its current name until the 17th century. With time, it also became a favorite dance of the Polish aristocratic class and acquired an instrumental form.

==Outside Poland==
===Polonaise in French courts===
The polonaise was first introduced in the 17th century in French courts, although the form originated in Poland and was very popular throughout Europe. This dance in 3/4 metre was designed to entertain the French royal court. The term polonaise was used over the term &quot;polonez&quot; at the start of the 18th century.

===Princess Anna Maria of Saxony=== 

Princess Anna Maria of Saxony collected sheet music for polonaises throughout her life time, collecting over 350. Her collection was focused on the finest examples of instrumentation.

===Maluku===

The polones (from either the Dutch &quot;polonez&quot;, or possibly the Portuguese &quot;polonesa&quot;) is a common feature of wedding receptions in Maluku. A loosely-defined group dance, it typically resembles a country dance or cèilidh, or in some cases a line dance.

<text>The Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54, by the German Romantic composer Robert Schumann was completed in 1845 and is the composer&#x27;s only piano concerto. The complete work was premiered in Dresden on 4 December 1845. It is one of the most widely performed and recorded piano concertos from the Romantic period.

The autograph manuscript of the concerto is preserved in the Heinrich Heine Institute in Düsseldorf.

== History ==
Schumann had worked on several piano concertos earlier. He began one in E-flat major in 1828, from 1829–31 he worked on one in F major, and in 1839, he wrote one movement of a concerto in D minor. None of these works were completed.

Already on 10 January 1833, Schumann first expressed the idea of writing a Piano Concerto in A minor. In a letter to his future father-in-law, Friedrich Wieck, he wrote: &quot;I think the piano concerto must be in C major or in A minor.&quot; From 17–20 May 1841, Schumann wrote a fantasy for piano and orchestra, his &quot;Phantasie&quot; in A minor. Schumann tried unsuccessfully to sell this one-movement piece to publishers. In August 1841 and January 1843 Schumann revised the piece, but was unsuccessful. His wife Clara, an accomplished pianist, then urged him to expand it into a full piano concerto. In 1845 he added the &quot;Intermezzo&quot; and &quot;Allegro vivace&quot; to complete the work. It remained the only piano concerto that Schumann finished.

The premiere of the first movement (&quot;Phantasie&quot;) took place on 13 August 1841 at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig with Clara Schumann as the soloist. The complete three-movement version was premiered in Dresden on 4 December 1845, again with Clara Schumann, and the dedicatee Ferdinand Hiller as the conductor. Less than a month later, on 1 January 1846, the concerto was performed in Leipzig, conducted by Felix Mendelssohn.

After this concerto, Schumann wrote two other pieces for piano and orchestra: the &quot;Introduction and Allegro Appassionato&quot; in G major, Op. 92, and the &quot;Introduction and Allegro Concertante&quot; in D minor, Op. 134.

== Instrumentation ==
The concerto is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, strings, and solo piano. With this instrumentation Schumann chose the usual orchestration in early Romantic music for this concerto.

== Structure ==

The piece, as marked in the score, is in three movements:

There is no break between these last two movements (&quot;attacca subito&quot;). The duration of the concerto is about 30 to 35 minutes, depending on the interpretation.

=== I. Allegro affettuoso ===
The main movement of the concerto is marked &quot;Allegro affettuoso&quot;; its origin lay in the one-movement fantasy written by Schumann in 1841, at whose core is the musical development of the conflict between the boisterous Florestan and the dreamy Eusebius, two characters Schumann often used to express the duality of being. The movement is set in 4/4 rhythm.

The piece starts with an energetic strike by strings and timpani, followed by a fierce, descending attack by the piano. This exposition chord is followed by a descending, rhythmically incisive chord progression of the solo piano corresponding to the ideal of the boisterous Florestan.

Only then, the main, dreamlike theme of Eusebius is introduced by the oboe along with other wind instruments. The melody begins with the notes C–H–A–A, which stand for the Italian spelling of the first name CHiArA of Schumann&#x27;s wife Clara, who was the soloist at the world premiere of the piano concerto. After its introduction by the woodwinds, the theme is then given to the soloist. Schumann provides great variety with this theme.

In the course of the first movement Schumann varies this theme in many ways. He first offers it in the A minor key of the movement, then we hear it again in major, and we can also hear small snatches of the tune in a very slow, A-flat section. The orchestra and especially the clarinet is often used against the piano in this movement: while the solo instrument is dedicated to the main theme of the concerto, the strings begin to intone a Florestan-like, syncopated side thought (bar 41), which becomes more and more dominant, until a variation of the Eusebian main theme recurs quietly but urgently.

This is followed by a subsection labeled &quot;Animato&quot;. At its end Schumann introduces a second theme, which does not reach the significance of the main theme.

Subsequently, the development of the main movement begins in the form of a dramatic lament (bar 156). This part almost reaches the position of an independent middle section. In A-flat major, the metrically altered main theme is referenced by piano arpeggios. Suddenly, however, chords of the Florestan theme interrupt the peace of the main theme. It comes to a struggle between the two ideals, which shapes the development further with rapid changes of soli and tutti.

With further dramatic progression and the modulation to A minor, the reprise is finally reached and cites the exposition almost tone for tone. The last tense progression brings forth a solo cadenza of monumental size and virtuosity (bar 402). It is undoubtedly the culmination of the movement.

In the coda, a throbbing, mysterious 2/4 rhythm dominates. This is turned into a fierce Davidsbündler-march a little later. The main movement of the concerto ends with four tutti chords.

=== II. Intermezzo – Andantino grazioso ===
This movement is in ABA form keyed in F major. The piano and strings open up the piece with a small, delicate tune, which is heard throughout the A section. In the B section in the dominant the cellos and later the other strings and wind instruments display a singing theme which is derived from the piano flourish in bar 7. The piano accompanies the singing theme and interjects but never takes the lead. After a shortened reprise of the A section the movement closes with small glimpses of the first movement&#x27;s theme before moving straight into the third movement.

=== III. Allegro vivace ===
The movement opens with a huge run up the strings while the piano takes the main A major theme. Schumann shows great color and variety in this movement. Though the nominal time signature is 3/4, the movement in reality alternates between 6/4 and 3/2. The piece is cast in a hybrid sonata-rondo form with an extended and exciting coda, ending with a long timpani roll and a huge chord from the orchestra.

== Intention ==
Despite its three movements, the work has retained the character of a fantasy. The basic idea expressed in the work is that of yearning and happiness between two loving people. Schumann musically transforms his fight for Clara in this work. The main theme of the first movement is similar to the melody of the Florestan aria from Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;. Congruent with Beethoven, Schumann saw this theme as an expression of the intimate connection between loyalty and the struggle for freedom. In this way the concerto is, like many of his other compositions, based on Schumann&#x27;s lifelong concern to fight against philistinism with musical means.

== Reception ==
The contemporary reception of the work was consistently positive. Clara Schumann wrote after the premiere: &quot;... how rich in invention, how interesting from the beginning to the end, how fresh and what a beautiful coherent whole!&quot;

Special emphasis was placed on the skilful, colorful and independent orchestral treatment, that would leave room for piano and orchestra alike. The Leipzig Allgemeine Musikzeitung praised the composition on December 31: &quot;because, fortunately, it avoids the usual monotony of the genre, by giving, with great love and care, the obligatory room to orchestra without diminishing the role of the piano, and manages to beautifully link both independent parts together&quot;.

The Dresdner Abendzeitung praised the &quot;quite independent, beautiful and interesting orchestral treatment&quot;, and recognizes that the &quot;receding of the piano part into the background&quot; could certainly also be seen as progress.

The work may have been used as a model by Edvard Grieg in composing his own Piano Concerto, also in A minor. Grieg&#x27;s concerto, like Schumann&#x27;s, employs a single powerful orchestral chord at its introduction before the piano&#x27;s entrance with a similar descending flourish. Sergei Rachmaninoff in turn used Grieg&#x27;s concerto as a model for his first Piano Concerto.

The work has become one of the most widely performed and recorded piano concertos from the Romantic period. It has frequently been paired with the Grieg concerto on recordings.

In popular music, the theme of Eusebius (together with Florestan one of Robert Schumann&#x27;s two imaginary alter egos), which appears played by an oboe and other wind instruments soon into the first movement, might have been an original source of inspiration, possibly via the 1911 suite &quot;Goyescas&quot; by Spanish composer Enrique Granados, of the song Bésame mucho, whose worldwide success dates back to the 1930s.

<text>Milan Cathedral ( ; ), or Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica of the Nativity of Saint Mary (), is the cathedral church of Milan, Lombardy, Italy. Dedicated to the Nativity of St. Mary (), it is the seat of the Archbishop of Milan, currently Archbishop Mario Delpini.

The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete: construction began in 1386, and the final details were completed in 1965. It is the largest church in the Italian Republic—the larger St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica is in the State of Vatican City, a sovereign state—and one of largest in the world.

==History==
Milan&#x27;s layout, with streets either radiating from the Duomo or circling it, reveals that the Duomo occupies what was the most central site in Roman Mediolanum, that of the public basilica facing the forum. The first cathedral, the &quot;new basilica&quot; (&quot;&quot;) dedicated to St Thecla, was completed by 355. It seems to share, on a slightly smaller scale, the plan of the contemporaneous church recently rediscovered beneath Tower Hill in London. An adjoining basilica was erected in 836. The old octagonal baptistery, the &quot;Battistero Paleocristiano&quot;, dates to 335 and still can be visited under the cathedral. When a fire damaged the cathedral and basilica in 1075, they were rebuilt as the Duomo.

===Construction begins===
In 1386, Archbishop Antonio da Saluzzo began construction of the cathedral. Start of the construction coincided with the ascension to power in Milan of the archbishop&#x27;s cousin Gian Galeazzo Visconti, and was meant as a reward to the noble and working classes, who had suffered under his tyrannical Visconti predecessor Barnabò. The construction of the cathedral was also dictated by very specific political choices: with the new construction site the population of Milan intended to emphasize the centrality of Milan in the eyes of Gian Galeazzo, a prominence questioned by the choice of the new lord to reside and maintain his court, like his father Galeazzo II, in Pavia and not in Milan. Before actual work began, three main buildings were demolished: the palace of the Archbishop, the Ordinari Palace and the Baptistry of St. Stephen at the Spring, while the old church of Sta. Maria Maggiore was exploited as a stone quarry. Enthusiasm for the immense new building soon spread among the population, and the shrewd Gian Galeazzo, together with his cousin the archbishop, collected large donations for the work-in-progress. The construction program was strictly regulated under the &quot;Fabbrica del Duomo&quot;, which had 300 employees led by first chief engineer Simone da Orsenigo. Orsenigo initially planned to build the cathedral from brick in Lombard Gothic style.

Visconti had ambitions to follow the newest trends in European architecture. In 1389, a French chief engineer, Nicolas de Bonaventure, was appointed, adding to the church its Rayonnant Gothic. Galeazzo gave the Fabbrica del Duomo exclusive use of the marble from the Candoglia quarry and exempted it from taxes. Ten years later another French architect, Jean Mignot, was called from Paris to judge and improve upon the work done, as the masons needed new technical aid to lift stones to an unprecedented height. Mignot declared all the work done up until then as in &quot;pericolo di ruina&quot; (&quot;peril of ruin&quot;), as it had been done &quot;sine scienzia&quot; (&quot;without science&quot;). In the following years, Mignot&#x27;s forecasts proved untrue, but they spurred Galeazzo&#x27;s engineers to improve their instruments and techniques. However, relations between Gian Galeazzo and the top management of the factory (chosen by the citizens of Milan) were often tense: the lord (who in 1395 had become Duke of Milan) intended to transform the cathedral into the dynastic &quot;mausoleum&quot; of the Visconti, inserting the central part of the cathedral funeral monument of his father Galeazzo II and this met with strong opposition from both the factory and the Milanese, who wanted to underline their autonomy. A clash arose, which forced Gian Galeazzo to decide on the foundation of a new construction site intended exclusively for the Visconti dynasty: the Certosa di Pavia. Work proceeded quickly, and at the death of Gian Galeazzo in 1402, almost half the cathedral was complete. Construction, however, stalled almost totally until 1480, for lack of money and ideas: the most notable works of this period were the tombs of Marco Carelli and Pope Martin V (1424) and the windows of the apse (1470s), of which those extant portray &quot;St. John the Evangelist&quot;, by Cristoforo de&#x27; Mottis, and &quot;Saint Eligius&quot; and &quot;San John of Damascus&quot;, both by Niccolò da Varallo. In 1452, under Francesco Sforza, the nave and the aisles were completed up to the sixth bay.
In 1488, both Leonardo da Vinci and Donato Bramante created models in a competition to design the central cupola; Leonardo later withdrew his submission. From 1500 to 1510, under Ludovico Sforza, the octagonal cupola was completed, and decorated in the interior with four series of 15 statues each, portraying saints, prophets, sibyls and other Figures from the Bible. The exterior long remained without any decoration, except for the &quot;Guglietto dell&#x27;Amadeo&quot; (&quot;Amadeo&#x27;s Little Spire&quot;), constructed 1507–1510. This is a Renaissance masterwork which nevertheless harmonized well with the general Gothic appearance of the church.

During the subsequent Spanish domination, the new church proved usable, even though the interior remained largely unfinished, and some bays of the nave and the transepts were still missing. In 1552 Giacomo Antegnati was commissioned to build a large organ for the north side of the choir, and Giuseppe Meda provided four of the sixteen reliefs which were to decorate the altar area (the program was completed by Federico Borromeo). In 1562, Marco d&#x27;Agrate&#x27;s &quot;St. Bartholomew&quot; and the famous Trivulzio candelabrum (12th century) were added.

===Borromeo===

After the accession of Carlo Borromeo to the archbishop&#x27;s throne, all lay monuments were removed from the Duomo. These included the tombs of Giovanni, and Filippo Maria Visconti, Francesco I and his wife Bianca, Galeazzo Maria, which were brought to unknown destinations. However, Borromeo&#x27;s main intervention was the appointment, in 1571, of Pellegrino Pellegrini as chief engineer— a contentious move, since to appoint Pellegrino, who was not a lay brother of the duomo, required a revision of the Fabbrica&#x27;s statutes.

Borromeo and Pellegrini strove for a new, Renaissance appearance for the cathedral, that would emphasise its Roman / Italian nature, and subdue the Gothic style, which was now seen as foreign. As the façade still was largely incomplete, Pellegrini designed a &quot;Roman&quot; style one, with columns, obelisks and a large tympanum. When Pellegrini&#x27;s design was revealed, a competition for the design of the façade was announced, and this elicited nearly a dozen entries, including one by Antonio Barca.

This design was never carried out, but the interior decoration continued: in 1575-1585 the presbytery was rebuilt, while new altars and the baptistry were added. The wooden choir stalls were constructed by 1614 for the main altar by Francesco Brambilla. In 1577 Borromeo finally consecrated the whole edifice as a new church, distinct from the old Santa Maria Maggiore and Santa Tecla (which had been unified in 1549 after heavy disputes).

===17th and 18th centuries===

At the beginning of the 17th century Federico Borromeo had the foundations of the new façade laid by Francesco Maria Richini and Fabio Mangone. Work continued until 1638 with the construction of five portals and two middle windows. In 1649, however, the new chief architect Carlo Buzzi introduced a striking revolution: the façade was to revert to the original Gothic style, including the already finished details within big Gothic pilasters and two giant belfries. Other designs were provided by, among others, Filippo Juvarra (1733) and Luigi Vanvitelli (1745), but all remained unapplied. In 1682 the façade of Santa Maria Maggiore was demolished and the cathedral&#x27;s roof covering was completed.

In 1762 one of the main features of the cathedral, the Madonnina&#x27;s spire, was erected at the dizzying height of 108.5 m. The spire was designed by Carlo Pellicani and sports at the top a famous polychrome Madonnina statue, designed by Giuseppe Perego that befits the stature of the cathedral. Given Milan&#x27;s notoriously damp and foggy climate, the Milanese consider it a fair-weather day when the Madonnina is visible from a distance, as it is so often covered by mist.

===Completion===

On 20 May 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte, about to be crowned King of Italy, ordered the façade to be finished by Pellicani. In his enthusiasm, he assured that all expenses would fall to the French treasurer, who would reimburse the Fabbrica for the real estate it had to sell. Even though this reimbursement was never paid, it still meant that finally, within only seven years, the cathedral&#x27;s façade was completed. Pellicani largely followed Buzzi&#x27;s project, adding some neo-Gothic details to the upper windows. As a form of thanksgiving, a statue of Napoleon was placed at the top of one of the spires. Napoleon was crowned King of Italy at the Duomo.

In the following years, most of the missing arches and spires were constructed. The statues on the southern wall were also finished, while in 1829–1858, new stained glass windows replaced the old ones, though with less aesthetically significant results. The last details of the cathedral were finished only in the 20th century: the last portal was inaugurated on 6 January 1965. This date is considered the very end of a process which had proceeded for generations, although even now, some uncarved blocks remain to be completed as statues. The Allied bombing of Milan in World War II further delayed construction. Like many other cathedrals in cities bombed by the Allied forces, the Duomo suffered some damage, although to a lesser degree compared to other major buildings in the vicinity such as the La Scala Theatre. It was quickly repaired and became a place of solace and gathering for displaced local residents.

The Duomo&#x27;s main façade went under renovation from 2003 to early 2009: as of February 2009, it has been completely uncovered, showing again the colours of the Candoglia marble.

In November 2012 officials announced a campaign to raise funds for the cathedral&#x27;s preservation by asking patrons to adopt the building&#x27;s spires. The effects of pollution on the 14th-century building entail regular maintenance, and recent austerity cuts to Italy&#x27;s cultural budget have left less money for the upkeep of cultural institutions, including the cathedral. To help make up funds, Duomo management launched a campaign offering its 135 spires up for &quot;adoption&quot;. Donors who contribute €100,000 (about $110,505) or more will have a plaque with their name engraved on it placed on the spire.

==Architecture and art==

The plan consists of a nave with four side aisles, crossed by a transept and then followed by choir and apse. The height of the nave is about , with the highest Gothic vaults in a completed church (not as high as the of Beauvais Cathedral, but it was never completed).

The roof is open to tourists (for a fee), which allows many a close-up view of some spectacular sculpture that would otherwise be unappreciated. The roof of the cathedral is renowned for the forest of openwork pinnacles and spires, set upon delicate flying buttresses.

The cathedral&#x27;s five broad naves, divided by 40 pillars, are reflected in the hierarchic openings of the façade. Even the transepts have aisles. The nave columns are high, and the apsidal windows are . It is a brick building, faced with marble from the quarries which Gian Galeazzo Visconti donated in perpetuity to the cathedral chapter. Maintenance and repairs are very complicated.

In 2015, Milan&#x27;s cathedral developed a new lighting system using LEDs.

===Aesthetic judgements===
The cathedral was built over several hundred years in a number of contrasting styles. Reactions to it have ranged from admiration to disfavour. The Guida d’Italia: Milano 1998 (Touring Club Editore, p. 154) points out that the early Romantics tended to praise it in &quot;the first intense enthusiasms for Gothic&quot;. As the Gothic Revival brought in a purer taste, condemnation was often equally intense.

John Ruskin commented acidly that the cathedral steals &quot;from every style in the world: and every style spoiled. The cathedral is a mixture of Perpendicular with Flamboyant, the latter being peculiarly barbarous and angular, owing to its being engrafted, not on a pure, but a very early penetrative Gothic … The rest of the architecture among which this curious Flamboyant is set is a Perpendicular with horizontal bars across: and with the most detestable crocketing, utterly vile. Not a ray of invention in a single form… Finally the statues all over are of the worst possible common stonemasons’ yard species, and look pinned on for show. The only redeeming character about the whole being the frequent use of the sharp gable ... which gives lightness, and the crowding of the spiry pinnacles into the sky.&quot; (Notebooks[M.6L]). The plastered ceiling painted to imitate elaborate tracery carved in stone particularly aroused his contempt as a &quot;gross degradation&quot;.

While appreciating the force of Ruskin&#x27;s criticisms, Henry James was more appreciative: &quot;A structure not supremely interesting, not logical, not … commandingly beautiful, but grandly curious and superbly rich. … If it had no other distinction it would still have that of impressive, immeasurable achievement … a supreme embodiment of vigorous effort.&quot;

===Main monuments and sights===


The interior of the cathedral includes numerous monuments and artworks. These include:

*At the left of the altar is located the most famous statue in the cathedral, Saint Bartholomew Flayed (1562) by Marco d&#x27;Agrate, which shows the saint carrying his own flayed skin thrown over his shoulders like a stole.

*The Archbishop Alberto da Intimiano&#x27;s sarcophagus, which is overlooked by a Crucifix in copper laminae (a replica).

*The sarcophagi of the archbishops Ottone Visconti and Giovanni Visconti, created by a Campionese master in the 14th century.

*The sarcophagus of Marco Carelli, who donated 35,000 ducati to accelerate the construction of the cathedral.

*The three magnificent altars by Pellegrino Pellegrini, which include the notable Federico Zuccari&#x27;s &quot;Visit of St. Peter to St. Agatha jailed&quot;.

*In the right transept, the monument to Gian Giacomo Medici di Marignano, called &quot;Medeghino&quot;, by Leone Leoni, and the adjacent Renaissance marble altar, decorated with gilt bronze statues.

*The presbytery is a late Renaissance masterpiece composing a choir, a Temple by Pellegrini, two pulpits with giant atlantes covered in copper and bronze, and two large organs. Around the choir, the two sacristies&#x27; portals, some frescoes and a fifteenth-century statue of Martin V by Jacopino da Tradate can be seen.

*The transepts house the Trivulzio Candelabrum, which is in two pieces. The base (attributed to Nicolas of Verdun, 12th no century), characterized by a fantastic ensemble of vines, vegetables and imaginary animals; and the stem, of the mid-16th century.

*In the left aisle, the Arcimboldi monument by Alessi and Romanesque figures depicting the &quot;Apostles&quot; in red marble and the neo-Classic baptistry by Pellegrini.

*A small red light bulb in the dome above the apse marks the spot where one of the nails reputedly from the Crucifixion of Christ has been placed. The Holy Nail is retrieved and exposed to the public every year, during a celebration known as the Rite of the Nivola.

*In November and December, in the days surrounding the birthdate of Saint Charles Borromeo, a series of large canvases, the &quot;Quadroni&quot; are exhibited along the nave.

*Since September 2005, in the cathedral&#x27;s crypt, beside the relics of Saint Charles Borromeo, there has been a video installation by English artist Mark Wallinger. Entitled &quot;Via Dolorosa&quot;, it consists of an 18-minute film reproducing scenes of the Passion excerpted from the film Jesus of Nazareth by Franco Zeffirelli.
*In November 2014 a white marble sculpture by Tony Cragg inspired by the Madonna statue on the rooftop was installed.
*The 5-manual, 225-rank pipe organ, built jointly by the Tamburini and Mascioni Italian organ building firms on Mussolini&#x27;s command, is currently the largest organ in all of Italy.

The American writer and journalist Mark Twain visited Milan in the summer of 1867. He dedicated chapter 18 of &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot; to Milan Cathedral, including many physical and historical details, and a visit to the roof. He describes the Duomo as follows:

Oscar Wilde visited Milan in June 1875. In a letter to his mother, he wrote: &quot;The Cathedral is an awful failure. Outside the design is monstrous and inartistic. The over-elaborated details stuck high up where no one can see them; everything is vile in it; it is, however, imposing and gigantic as a failure, through its great size and elaborate execution.&quot;

In &quot;Italian Hours&quot;, Henry James describes: a certain exhibition that I privately enjoyed of the relics of St. Charles Borromeus. This holy man lies at his eternal rest in a small but gorgeous sepulchral chapel … and for the modest sum of five francs you may have his shrivelled mortality unveiled and gaze at it with whatever reserves occur to you. The Catholic Church never renounces a chance of the sublime for fear of a chance of the ridiculous--especially when the chance of the sublime may be the very excellent chance of five francs. The performance in question, of which the good San Carlo paid in the first instance the cost, was impressive certainly, but as a monstrous matter or a grim comedy may still be. The little sacristan, having secured his audience, … lighted a couple of extra candles and proceeded to remove from above the altar, by means of a crank, a sort of sliding shutter, just as you may see a shop-boy do of a morning at his master&#x27;s window...The black mummified corpse of the saint is stretched out in a glass coffin, clad in his mouldering canonicals, mitred, crosiered and gloved, glittering with votive jewels. It is an extraordinary mixture of death and life; the desiccated clay, the ashen rags, the hideous little black mask and skull, and the living, glowing, twinkling splendour of diamonds, emeralds and sapphires. The collection is really fine, and many great historic names are attached to the different offerings. Whatever may be the better opinion as to the future of the Church, I can&#x27;t help thinking she will make a figure in the world so long as she retains this great fund of precious &quot;properties,&quot; this prodigious capital decoratively invested and scintillating throughout Christendom at effectively-scattered points.

==Astronomical observations==

From 1 December 1786, the Austrian Empire adopted “transalpine time”. The astronomers at Brera Astronomical Observatory were engaged by Count Giuseppe Di Wilczek, the plenipotentiary governor of Lombardy, to build a meridian line inside the Duomo. The meridian was constructed by Giovanni Angelo Cesaris and Francesco Reggio, with Roger Boscovich acting as a consultant.

The meridian line was laid on the floor of the Duomo at the west end so as to be accessible and not interfere with religious services. A hole was inserted in the roof near the south wall at a height of . The Duomo is not quite wide enough for a hole at this height so the meridian line extends up the north wall for about . As the beam of light crossed the brass line and indicated solar noon, a signal was given towards the tower of the Palazzo dei Giureconsulti. A person there alerted Sforzesco Castle and a cannon was fired to announce solar noon to the city. This signal was then used to set all of the city clocks to the same time.

The line was examined in 1976 by the architects of the Duomo and astronomers from Brera. There was a deviation in azimuth by up to and in level by up to but the accuracy of the line still enabled the fixing of solar noon to within 2 seconds.

<text>The Weekly World News is a tabloid formerly published in a newspaper format reporting mostly fictional &quot;news&quot; stories in the United States from 1979 to 2007. The paper was renowned for its outlandish cover stories often based on supernatural or paranormal themes and an approach to news that verged on the satirical. Its characteristic black-and-white covers have become pop-culture images widely used in the arts. It ceased print publication in August 2007. The company has a library of 110,000+ articles and 300+ original characters.

In 2009, the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; was relaunched as an online and social media publication. In July 2021, the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; announced the formation of Weekly World News Studios, to develop and produce entertainment projects based on its brand and characters.

== History ==
Generoso Pope Jr. launched the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; in 1979 to continue using the black-and-white press that sister tabloid &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; had been printed on before it switched to color printing. The &quot;WWN&quot; was published in Lantana, Florida, until it moved to Boca Raton in the late 1990s. It was unique as a tabloid because it was printed entirely in black and white. Eddie Clontz was its long-time editor, a 10th-grade dropout from North Carolina, and a former copy editor at small newspapers. In the 2000s, the circulation of &quot;WWN&quot; peaked at 1.2 million per issue. &quot;WWN&quot; went on to thrive online from 2009 to 2015 and was relaunched in 2019 by senior editor Greg D&#x27;Alessandro, along with investor David Collins.

The editor-in-chief from 2009 to 2018 was Neil McGinness. The editor-in-chief since August 2019 has been D&#x27;Alessandro.

==General approach to stories==
The &quot;WWN&quot; traditionally claimed that it always printed the truth, but many stories appeared to have comedic intent – more so as time went by. As recalled by Joe Berger, a former White House correspondent who served as a &quot;WWN&quot; editor from 1981 to 2001, &quot;About 80 percent of the stories were clipped from newspapers. We had three or four clippers who were surrounded by mountains of newspapers. We spent the day looking at newspapers throughout the world, clipping weird stories. About 50 percent were about people narrowly escaping death; someone falling off a cliff, or hanging off a tree branch for four days until they were rescued.&quot; The introduction to &quot;Batboy Lives!&quot; states that one person would read the tabloid for real news, whereas another would read it for the humor. The tabloid&#x27;s main rival &quot;Sun&quot; carried a fine print disclaimer, whereas the &quot;WWN&quot; never publicly contradicted the accuracy of its own stories until 2004, when it began stating that &quot;the reader should suspend disbelief for the sake of enjoyment.&quot; In the 2000s, &quot;Sun&quot; moved more toward articles on health and miracle cures, leaving &quot;WWN&quot; alone in its niche of supernatural news stories, such as sightings of Elvis Presley and the Loch Ness monster.

Thus, for a significant percentage of its content, the &quot;WWN&quot; ran strange-but-true stories, such as &quot;DEVOUT CHRISTIAN ATTACKED – AND HE&#x27;S THE ONE FINED!&quot; referring to British street evangelist Harry Hammond. Other verifiable stories included those of a giant mutant hog monster attacking Georgia and the arrest of a Tallahassee, Florida, man whose pants were on fire at the time. It reported on the discovery of an infant dragon preserved in formaldehyde proving the existence of dragons, although this was later proven to be a hoax. It also quoted Vatican exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth on Pope John Paul II&#x27;s battles with Satan and ran a story on the trademark dispute between &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot; and a German erotic periodical also named &quot;O&quot;. Whether partially fictional or wholly true, the writing style remained as fact-based as possible. As writer Bob Lind recalled for &quot;Mental Floss&quot;, &quot;We wrote these things straight, for people who wanted to believe these things. We wrote it like a news story. We wrote a lede with a dash in it, filled it in, and then had a money quote.&quot;

In February 1989, &quot;WWN&quot; published real, graphic photos on its front page of the post-autopsied body of executed serial killer Ted Bundy. Managing editor Eddie Clontz defended his decision to run the photos, claiming that he hoped that such images would deter other murderers. Angry and surprised officials in Florida vowed to catch the person responsible, eventually arresting a low-level employee of the Alachua County, Florida Medical Examiner&#x27;s office and charging him with taking the photographs and selling them to the &quot;WWN&quot;.

As other supermarket tabloids switched to celebrity gossip, the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; remained devoted to its original content, refusing to fact-check its way out of a sensational story, or, as Iain Calder, &quot;WWN&quot; co-founder and &quot;Enquirer&quot; editor-in-chief from 1973 to 1997, told &quot;Mental Floss&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;d say Elvis was still alive and run a picture of what Elvis would have looked like at that time. We&#x27;d get dozens of phone calls. If someone calls and says, &#x27;I saw Elvis,&#x27; you didn&#x27;t try to disprove the headline.&quot; Derrik Lang, a stringer for the paper, said that &quot;everything in my stories was fake – you know, depending on how you define fake.&quot; Common &quot;WWN&quot; stories involved alien abductions, the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, time travel, predictions of an oncoming depression or apocalypse, and other newly found lost prophecies or religious relics. There were also characters who, in later years, became stock fixtures in &quot;WWN&quot; news stories, most famously Bat Boy, a half-bat half-boy discovered in West Virginia caverns, and P&#x27;lod, an extraterrestrial who became involved in Earth politics and had an affair with Hillary Clinton.

==Columns and features==
Regular columns included Ed Anger (opinion), first Dear Babs and later Dear Dotti (outspoken advice columnists), Hi Dolly (relationship advice), Horse Sense (medical advice), Monkey Business (financial and business-related advice and information) and Madame Malisa (psychic). The most famous of these was Ed Anger, a character created in 1979 by staffer Rafe Klinger; Anger was a perpetually angry conservative (a typical column began &quot;I&#x27;m pig-biting mad!&quot;), who railed against illegal immigrants, women, speed limits and rainforests, among many other perceived ills.

Beginning on May 9, 2005, the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; went &quot;All New&quot; along with other tabloid papers such as the National Enquirer, which had become &quot;Bigger⁠ ⁠•⁠ ⁠Bolder⁠ ⁠•⁠ ⁠Better.&quot; In the new &quot;Weekly World News&quot;, Serena and Sonya Sabak&#x27;s psychic column was replaced by the horoscopes of Madame Malisa, and Dotti Primrose&#x27;s &quot;Dear Dotti&quot; was supplanted by an advice column called &quot;Hi Dolly&quot; written by a middle-aged Southern blonde woman. The new &quot;WWN&quot; included a weekly &quot;Weird Picture Search&quot; by &quot;Mad&quot; cartoonist Sergio Aragonés. Other features included Trivia, Test Yourself, Jokes, and &quot;Miss Adventure&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;The Gayest American Hero&quot;, who has penetrated the mob, gone to Hollywood, and fought DRAG-U-LA traveling from the depths of the Earth&#x27;s center to outer space.

Two pages of comic strips were spun off from feature stories. For two years, in 2004 and 2005, Peter Bagge created a Bat Boy comic &quot;using celebrities and current events and creating totally absurd and implausible stories and situations for them.&quot; In 2011, IDW Publishing released a hardcover collection of Bagge&#x27;s strips. &quot;SpyCat&quot;, created by Dick Siegel, was drawn by Ernie Colón. SpyCat spoke nine different languages ranging from Persian to &quot;dog&quot; and was armed with &quot;Adamwestium&quot; claws and deadly cat-of-nine-tails. He wrote free-form poetry when not waging war on America&#x27;s enemies—at home and abroad. &quot;Matthew Daemon&quot;, also created by Dick Siegel, was written and illustrated by Mike Collins and was a spinoff from the &quot;SOS Matthew Daemon (Seeker of Obscure Supernaturals)&quot; feature. Daemon&#x27;s lair was located beneath Grant&#x27;s Tomb. Daemon specialized in B-List Monster hunting. &quot;Alien Baby&quot; by Craig Boldman chronicled the adventures of Moogera the deadbeat alien dad, alien baby Ethan, and Stacy, his Earth-born mother.

Though it mainly featured offbeat stories, it also featured legitimate games and quizzes such as crossword puzzles, a segment called &quot;Bedside Manner&quot; where readers choose which celebrity is best suited for the featured celebrity and &quot;Mystery Eyes&quot; which featured photographs of five pairs of eyes which belonged to celebrities and readers have to guess who they are.

==Recurring subjects==

===Bat Boy===
Bat Boy was first featured in a 1992 issue after being found in a cave in West Virginia (Lost World Caverns). He has since led police on a high-speed chase, fought in the war on terror, led the troops to capture Saddam Hussein, bitten Santa Claus, and traveled into outer space. In 2000, he gave his endorsement to Al Gore. It was foretold that Bat Boy would become president in 2028.

The story of Bat Boy was the basis for an acclaimed off-Broadway musical, &quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot;, in which Bat Boy meets a tragic end. In addition to articles, Bat Boy has been featured in a comic strip since 2004, though it is said that only the articles are the &quot;true&quot; story of Bat Boy.

===Page 5 Honey===
Each week a different model was featured on page 5 and on the back page. She was usually wearing a bikini and a description of her was printed. This feature ended after the Halloween issue of 2006.

===&quot;ALIVE!&quot;===

One of the many other recurring subjects was the occasional &quot;ALIVE!&quot; cover story. Most often the story pertained to some sort of creature such as a mummy, prehistoric creature, or, occasionally, a human who had been frozen in a block of ice (e.g. Santa Claus).

Another subject often tackled by &quot;WWN&quot; is the reemergence of many prominent figures believed to be deceased, including Hank Williams, Marilyn Monroe, John F. Kennedy, Adolf Hitler, and Michael Jackson. Survivors of the Titanic and Hindenburg were also occasionally featured. Among the most frequently printed reports were those asserting that &quot;Elvis is alive.&quot;

The &quot;WWN&quot; frequently reported Elvis sightings with a series of articles claiming that Elvis Presley had faked his death and had recently emerged from years of seclusion to prepare for a comeback. Obviously altered photos purported to show a gray-haired, balding Elvis sneaking into a movie theater and coming out of a Burger King restaurant. When the U.S. Postal Service conducted a poll to determine the design of the Elvis commemorative postage stamp, the &quot;WWN&quot; conducted its own poll pitting the USPS&#x27;s 1950s Elvis and 1970s Elvis versus its own, 1990s Elvis; the elderly Elvis won.

In 1994, the newspaper ran a front cover with the headline &quot;Elvis Presley Dead!&quot;, stating that Elvis was now &quot;really dead&quot; from heart failure after slipping into a diabetic coma. In a 2004 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article on Clontz&#x27;s death, humorist Gene Weingarten claimed that he and Dave Barry were the sources of the story. According to Weingarten, the &quot;WWN&quot; later reported that claims of Elvis&#x27; (belated) death had been a hoax. In an earlier telling of his story, Weingarten varied some details.

===The World&#x27;s Fattest...===
Numerous stories regarding shockingly obese people made the pages of &quot;WWN&quot;, the most popular of which was Roland Gillespie, the world&#x27;s fattest man. After Roland was first discovered, &quot;WWN&quot; encouraged readers to send in their guesses as to exactly how much they believed Roland weighed. Weighing in at over 576.2 lbs., Roland was featured being weighed and measured and the crew was possibly sat on, by the world&#x27;s fattest man. Later stories involved Rolands attempts to lose weight through the OMAD diet, his struggle with near fatal obesity, and claims that he ate his family. Other stories featured the exploits of the world&#x27;s fattest couple at the gym, the world&#x27;s fattest baby, and even a similar weight-guessing contest featuring the world&#x27;s fattest dog. One continuing story featured a morbidly obese man named Buster Simcus who had lost so much weight that it left 80 pounds of loose skin hanging off his body that he was planning to have surgically removed. By the next story, he had regained the weight, severely damaging his scars.

===Upcoming economic depressions===
&quot;WWN&quot; covered stories that featured analysis of a coming Great Depression in the immediate future in which many prominent celebrities, politicians, and icons of business would become penniless. The cover story of the June 6, 2005, issue warned that the second Great Depression was &quot;just weeks away.&quot; Because of this, Texas oil tycoons were planning to flee to Luxembourg, the only country to survive this economic crash. Consequences of this depression would include mass starvation, a disease epidemic, mobs of looters and a return to pagan religions and Satanism.

===Religion and Biblical relics===
Another typical &quot;Weekly World News&quot; topic was new Bible-related findings, including relics from Noah&#x27;s Ark, the Garden of Eden (claimed by the tabloid to be in Colorado), the discovery of additional commandments from God, and sandals worn by Jesus. The magazine also reported on when Jesus will return to Earth, and held an interview with Sisyphus when he finished his eternal boulder-hauling &quot;workout.&quot; Other stories stated that natural disasters such as earthquakes and human economic activity like drilling for oil have opened up gates and portals to Hell from which demons have escaped to wreak havoc upon the earth. A story shortly after September 11, 2001 showed the face of Satan appearing in a cloud of dust caused by the collapse of the World Trade Center. Similar stories, wherein Satan&#x27;s face had appeared in a thunderstorm, had appeared before.

===Terrorism===
Following the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, &quot;WWN&quot; featured articles about plans for future terrorist attacks on the United States of America. A 2004 cover story described plans by Kim Jong-il to eventually invade and conquer the United States. Other stories featured profiles on the location and nature of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction, including the news that Saddam Hussein had an arsenal of giant slingshots, the missing link, and dinosaurs. In 2003, a series of articles profiled the ongoing relationship between and eventual marriage of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Other stories have made claims that Bin Laden was actually a dwarf, that he recruited a cloned Adolf Hitler to join Al Qaeda, and that he was in fact dead, long before his actual death and that the CIA was keeping it a secret. After his being captured by Bat Boy, Saddam was humiliated by female prison guards, won the United States lottery, and even demanded that the government pay for his sex change operation.

===Presidency===
&quot;WWN&quot; has often been the home to political satire regarding current and past presidential administrations. The magazine reported that the founding fathers were all gay and that George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were actually women. According to the paper, President Lincoln was insane, and his ghost had also been spotted in the White House giving President George W. Bush advice on the war in Iraq. Stories about President George W. Bush capitalized on the public&#x27;s perception that he lacked intelligence. The paper chronicled his plans to run for pope, his love affair with Janet Reno, and his intention to nominate Yoda as secretary of defense. The June 21, 2004, issue stated that Vice President Dick Cheney was actually a robot and that his frequent trips to the hospital allowed him to rewire his circuits.

===Aliens===
Aliens are another subject frequently tackled by &quot;WWN&quot;. &quot;Weekly World News&quot; blamed these creatures for holes in the ozone. A Roswell crash survivor, &quot;Altair Bob,&quot; made contact with &quot;WWN&quot; via telepathic e-mail. Several factions of extraterrestrials have been using the moon to dump garbage. Martians have been monitoring the Mideast crisis. Warrior aliens have been resurrecting the dead, fighting Bigfoot, and training in a mock U.S. town hidden in Antarctica. San Franciscans have opened their hearts to immigrants from Mercury.

One such alien, named P&#x27;Lod, who made several appearances in &quot;WWN&quot;, has been known to fraternize with known women of politics. It was reported that he and Hillary Clinton once had a close relationship that ended up in a brawl between him and President Bill Clinton, who went on a jealous rage. After P&#x27;Lod left Hillary Clinton, he expressed a lot of interest in Condoleezza Rice. A June 15, 1993 cover announced Hillary Clinton&#x27;s adoption of an alien baby.

In the June 7, 1994, edition, &quot;WWN&quot; reported that 12 U.S. senators were aliens from other planets. In response, several senators or their spokespersons humorously &quot;confirmed&quot; the story. One, William S. Cohen of Maine, told the mainstream press, &quot;It is preferable to be a space alien than a space cadet.&quot;

In the August 11, 1998, edition, &quot;WWN&quot; reported that autograph dealer Steve Koschal offered to pay $1 million for anything signed by an extraterrestrial. Koschal said he would pay the million dollars to anyone who had a signed letter or signed photograph or anything signed by a visitor from outer space. &quot;Hundreds of people claim to have been abducted and taken aboard UFOs and yet there&#x27;s not a single verifiable signature of an extraterrestrial being anywhere on Earth,&quot; said Koschal in an exclusive interview. &quot;Someone out there must have asked one of these creatures for an autograph,&quot; continued Koschal. &quot;If not, someone will in the future. When they do, I want to be the first collector to acquire it.&quot;

The subject of space aliens endorsing U.S. presidential candidates in various elections was also a recurring topic. During the 2000 U.S. presidential election, then-candidate George W. Bush posed for photographers with a &quot;Weekly World News&quot; issue opened to the article reading, &quot;Space Alien Backs Bush for President!&quot;.

===Cryptids===
Cryptids and half-animal half-human hybrids are another frequent topic of &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. Creatures such as Bigfoot, merpeople, real-life catwomen, half-alligator half-humans, frog babies, kangaroo women, and many other creatures have taken the world by storm on various covers (e.g. &quot;Abominable Beachman strikes terror in Hawaii!&quot; and &quot;Bigfoot Steals Race Car!!!!&quot;) including the aforementioned &#x27;Bat Boy&#x27;.

===Merfolk===
The existence of mermen and mermaids is also frequently reported in the pages of the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. One detailed article recounted a mermaid being caught in a fishing net off the coast of Florida on April 17, 2004. According to the article, she was at least half human, very sociable, and extremely intelligent; and was able to talk in a sophisticated &quot;three dimensional language&quot; that depends heavily on noises that could possibly be connected to the &quot;click languages&quot; prevalent in parts of Africa and on hand movements that look like sign language.

Similar to their female counterparts, mermen are found within the pages of the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. On June 17, 2003, a merman was reported to have been caught in the South Pacific, this one measuring only 28 inches.

==Stories taken as legitimate==
Since the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; began to publish online, its stories have occasionally been treated as legitimate news stories by readers unaware of the nature of the publication.
* In late 2010 the &quot;WWN&quot; ran a satirical story, written by Frank Lake, indicating that the Los Angeles Police Department intended to purchase 10,000 jet packs at a total cost of one billion dollars. The story was reported as fact by the &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; morning news show.
* The &quot;WWN&quot; reported twice, once in 2011 and once in 2012, that the social media website Facebook would shut down. Both times, the claim was interpreted by some as genuine. The second time, Facebook issued an official reply to the technology blog &quot;Mashable&quot;, stating, &quot;The answer is no, so please help us put an end to this silliness. We didn&#x27;t get the memo about shutting down and there&#x27;s lots to do, so we&#x27;ll just keep cranking away like always.&quot;

==Demise and relaunch==
In 1999, David Pecker bought American Media Inc., which owned the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. Within the next two years, many of &quot;WWN&quot;&#x27;s longtime writers and editors, including Clontz, Sal Ivone, Derek Clontz, Susan Jimison, Joe Berger, Bob Lind, Dick Kulpa, and Leskie Pinson, were gone. Clontz left the paper in 2001, having been there 20 years, and died in 2004.

In a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2007, American Media said that sales of &quot;WWN&quot; in 2006 were only 83,000 per issue. &quot;WWN&quot; ceased its print publication in August 2007. It was then published as an insert within the &quot;Sun&quot; magazine, with new material being printed alongside articles and columns from older issues, until &quot;Sun&quot; itself ceased publication in 2012.

In October 2008, Bat Boy L.L.C., a company started by Neil McGinness, bought &quot;WWN&quot;. It was relaunched as an online-only publication in 2009. In January 2011, the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; was made available via an online paid subscription. The online edition is emailed to subscribers biweekly. The online edition closely resembles the printed &quot;Weekly World News&quot; in both appearance (it uses the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; logo used from 1979 to 2001) and subject matter (the first issue&#x27;s headline was &quot;Werewolf Sues Airline Over Flight Delay&quot;). In January 2013, &quot;Weekly World News&quot; announced that it would go behind a paywall. An initial limit was set at three free article views, though select content remained unmetered.

In August 2019, Greg D&#x27;Alessandro took over as CEO/Editor-In-Chief with David Collins as President/CFO. They relaunched the brand and began developing a number of projects with Hollywood producers.

On September 21, 2020, &quot;Weekly World News&quot; launched a Kickstarter campaign in an effort to expand reporting, graphics and video production, as well as to get the tabloid back into print. The campaign was successful in reaching its financial goal.

On March 21, 2021, &#x27;Weekly World News&quot; printed its first full-length print publication in 15 years. &quot;Weekly World News Greatest Covers&quot; was printed as a limited special edition (5,000 copies).

==Bat Boy television series==
On July 31, 2024, it was reported by the web site &quot;Deadline&quot; that Netflix was developing a Bat Boy live-action television series.

==In popular culture==
Articles from &quot;Weekly World News&quot; were a primary inspiration for David Byrne&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;True Stories&quot; as reported by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine: &quot;Your big inspiration for the movie was reading headlines in tabloids. Were you mostly reading &quot;Weekly World News&quot; at the time?&quot; David Byrne: &quot;Yeah, they were all from &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. They weren&#x27;t really in the &quot;[National] Enquirer&quot;.&quot;

In January 1996, a satirical comedy series inspired by &quot;Weekly World News&quot; premiered on the USA Network, and was hosted by longtime journalist Edwin Newman. The series was canceled after one season.

&quot;Tabloid Dreams&quot; (1996) by Pulitzer-winning author [Robert Olen Butler] is a short-story collection that used headlines from the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; and other supermarket tabloids as writing prompts. Two examples: “Jealous Husband Returns in the Form of a Parrot” and “Boy Born with Tattoo of Elvis.”

In 1999, the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; was declared the &quot;Official Newspaper of the Windows 2000 Team&quot; at Microsoft, and its Senior Vice President, Brian Valentine, would read excerpts from it at what was called Windows Information Meetings, or WIMs, while attempting to entertain and encourage the developers, testers, program managers, and writers involved.

A parody of the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; called &quot;The World&quot; was featured in the 1997 film &quot;Men in Black&quot; as &quot;The best damn investigative journalism in the country.&quot; A publication that told the truth because it was &#x27;a free country.&#x27; It is cited as a source of material and shows the bug case they are working on.

&quot;Weekly World News&quot; was also featured in the &quot;Supernatural&quot;, season 2 episode &quot;Tall Tales&quot;.

Disney Channel&#x27;s paranormal/supernatural-themed animated show &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; features a reference to Bat Boy in the show&#x27;s intro. Shion Takeuchi and &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; creator Alex Hirsch, executive producers of &quot;Inside Job&quot;, said they were inspired by pages of the publication.

Rapper Travis Scott parodies the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; and references the character Bat Boy on his cover for his 2021 single Escape Plan / Mafia, with a similar tabloid named &quot;Weekly World Truths&quot;.

<doc id="222551" wikidata="Q1136830" url="?curid=222551" title="Motif (software)">
<text>In computing, Motif refers to both a graphical user interface (GUI) specification and the widget toolkit for building applications that follow that specification under the X Window System on Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The Motif look and feel is distinguished by its use of rudimentary square and chiseled three-dimensional effects for its various user interface elements.

Motif is the toolkit for the Common Desktop Environment and IRIX Interactive Desktop, thus it was the standard widget toolkit for Unix. Closely related to Motif is the Motif Window Manager (MWM).

After many years as proprietary software, Motif was released in 2012, as free software under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL-2.1-or-later).

==History==
Motif was created by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) to be a standard graphical user interface for Unix platforms. Rather than create a new interface from scratch, OSF opened a Request For Technology (RFT) in 1988 to solicit existing technologies from third parties. OSF intended to either adopt an existing interface wholesale, or create one using a combination of technologies from multiple existing products. Forty products were submitted, from which OSF selected twenty-three finalists. Among the finalists were Adobe Inc.&#x27;s Display Postscript, Sun Microsystems&#x27; OPEN LOOK, Digital Research&#x27;s GEM, IXI Limited&#x27;s X.desktop, Apollo Computer&#x27;s Open Dialogue, Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Andrew User Interface System, Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s XUI, and Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft&#x27;s CXI and PM/X. Ultimately, OSF selected a combination of the look and feel, window manager and Common User Access compliance from HP and Microsoft&#x27;s CXI, along with the widget toolkit API and User Interface Language (UIL) from DEC&#x27;s XUI. Motif was first shipped by OSF in 1989.

==Standardization==

Motif is the basic building block of the Common Desktop Environment, which was the standard desktop for commercial Unix.

The IEEE 1295 standard (now withdrawn) defines the &quot;Motif API&quot;. As of version 2.1, Motif supports Unicode, which made it widely used in several multilingual environments.

==Licensing==
===Proprietary===
Motif was originally made available under a license requiring royalty payments.

===Open Motif===
A version called Open Motif (substantially the same codebase under a different license) was released on May 15, 2000, under a license which allowed royalty-free distribution of Open Motif if the platform upon which it is used was open sourcebut was not an open source license itself. The name was criticized by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation for likelihood to mislead people into thinking it was proper open source or free software, particularly for the Open Group&#x27;s statement that they had &quot;released the source code of Motif to the Open Source community&quot;. The initial release of Open Motif was version 2.1.30 in May 2000; Open Motif 2.3 was released in June 2007, followed by a 2.3.1 bug fix release in September 2008 and a 2.3.2 bug fix release in March 2009.

During the time when Motif was closed source software, the LessTif project was created with the aim of creating a free software implementation, under the LGPL.

===GNU LGPL===
In October 2012, Motif was released as a source code distribution under the GNU LGPL-2.1-or-later. Motif&#x27;s source code is available on SourceForge.

<text>A widget toolkit, widget library, GUI toolkit, or UX library is a library or a collection of libraries containing a set of graphical control elements (called &quot;widgets&quot;) used to construct the graphical user interface (GUI) of programs.

Most widget toolkits additionally include their own rendering engine. This engine can be specific to a certain operating system or windowing system or contain back-ends to interface with multiple ones and also with rendering APIs such as OpenGL, OpenVG, or EGL.
The look and feel of the graphical control elements can be hard-coded or decoupled, allowing the graphical control elements to be themed/skinned.

==Overview==

Some toolkits may be used from other languages by employing language bindings. Graphical user interface builders such as e.g. Glade Interface Designer facilitate the authoring of GUIs in a WYSIWYG manner employing a user interface markup language such as in this case GtkBuilder.

The GUI of a program is commonly constructed in a cascading manner, with graphical control elements being added directly to on top of one another.

Most widget toolkits use event-driven programming as a model for interaction. The toolkit handles user events, for example when the user clicks on a button. When an event is detected, it is passed on to the application where it is dealt with. The design of those toolkits has been criticized for promoting an oversimplified model of event-action, leading programmers to create error-prone, difficult to extend and excessively complex application code. Finite-state machines and hierarchical state machines have been proposed as high-level models to represent the interactive state changes for reactive programs.

== Windowing systems ==
A window is considered to be a graphical control element. In some windowing systems, windows are added directly to the scene graph (canvas) by the window manager, and can be stacked and layered on top of each other through various means. Each window is associated with a particular application which controls the widgets added to its canvas, which can be watched and modified by their associated applications.

<text>Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov (; 12 January 1903 – 7 February 1960), was a Soviet physicist who played a central role in organizing and directing the former Soviet program of nuclear weapons, and has been referred to as &quot;father of the Russian atomic bomb&quot;.

As many of his contemporaries in Russia, Kurchatov, initially educated as a naval architect, was an &quot;autodidact&quot; in nuclear physics and was brought by Soviet establishment to accelerate the feasibility of the &quot;super bomb&quot;. Aided by effective intelligence management by Soviet agencies on the American Manhattan Project, Kurchatov oversaw the quick development and testing of the first Soviet nuclear weapon, which was roughly based on the first American device, at Semipalatinsk in the Kazakh SSR in 1949.

Kurchatov, a recipient of many former Soviet honors, had an instrumental role in modern nuclear industry in Russia. His rapid decline in health is mainly attributed to a 1949 radiation accident in Chelyabinsk-40. Kurchatov died in Moscow in 1960, aged 57.

==Biography==

Kurchatov was born in a small village in Simsky Zavod in Ufa, Russia (now it is a town of Sim, Chelyabinsk Oblast), on 12 January 1903. His father, Vasily Alekseyevich Kurchatov, was a surveyor and former forester&#x27;s assistant in the Ural Mountains; his mother, Mariya Vasilyevna Ostroumova, a daughter of the parish priest at Sim, was a school teacher. He was an elder and second of three children of Vasily Kurchatov, and the family moved to Simferopol in Crimea in 1912. The Kurchatovs were of Russian ethnicity. 

After his older sister, Antonina, passed away in Crimea, Igor grew up with his younger brother, Boris, where they both attended the Simferopol gymnasium №1, and was a Mandolin player at his school&#x27;s orchestra. During World War I, Igor and Boris had to work to support the family, becoming a skilled welder and developing interests in steam engines, wishing to become an engineer.

Kurchatov attended the Crimea State University where he studied physics and had built a reputation for his mechanical ability to perform physics experiments, for which he was titled as a &quot;doctorate&quot;. Kurchatov soon moved to Baku in Azerbaijan after securing physics assistance job at the Azerbaijan Polytechnic Institute. There, he presented his experiments in electrical conduction, which impressed Dr. Abram Ioffe who was there as a guest, and invited him to Physico-Technical Institute in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Kurchatov married Marina Sinelnikova in 1927 and they did not have children.

While working under Ioffe on ferroelectricity and semiconductors, Kurchatov entered in Leningrad Polytechnic Institute to study engineering and secured his engineer&#x27;s degree in naval architecture in 1930s. Between 1931 and 1934, Kurchatov worked in the Radium Institute which was headed by . In 1937, Kurchatov was a part of the team that designed and built the first cyclotron particle accelerator in Russia, which was installed in Radium Institute. Installation was finished in 1937, and research began to take place on 21 September 1939. During this time, Kurchatov considered studying physics abroad at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States but the plan fell apart due to political reasons. Until 1933, Kurchatov did not go into the nuclear physics and his work was primarily focused on electromagnetism but did an important work on nuclear isomer and radioactivity in 1935.

In 1940, Kurchatov moved to Kazan and raised objection on spontaneous fission when Georgy Flyorov directed a letter about the discovery. In 1942–43, Kurchatov found a project with the Soviet Navy and moved to Murmansk where he worked with fellow physicist Anatoly Alexandrov. By November 1941, they had devised a method of demagnetizing ships to protect them from German mines, which was in active use until the end of World War II and thereafter. The job with Soviet Navy solved Kurchatov&#x27;s objection on spontaneous fission when he wrote in 1944: &quot;Uranium must be separated into two parts at the moment of detonation. Upon the breaking up of the nuclei in a kilogram of uranium, the energy released must be equal to the explosion of 20,000 tons of TNT equivalent.&quot;

==Soviet program of nuclear weapons==
After 1942, Kurchatov oversaw the facility expansion and overall development of the Russian program in the Soviet Union, from military to civilian dimensions of the nuclear program. Kurchatov is widely known as father of the Soviet program of nuclear weapons, and is often compared to American Robert Oppenheimer— although Kurchatov was not a theoretical physicist.

The Soviet establishment did not start the program until 1943 despite receiving intelligence from Russian spies in the United States and a warning from Georgii Flerov. Kurchatov, as many others, was working towards building ammunition for the Red Army&#x27;s campaign against the German forces at the Eastern Front of World War II. Initially, the Soviet establishment asked Abram Ioffe to lead the Soviet program of nuclear weapons, which Ioffe rejected, instead recommending Kurchatov in 1942. Kurchatov established the Laboratory No. 2 in Moscow by bringing Abram Alikhanov (who worked on heavy water production) from Armenia and Lev Artsimovich who was instrumental in electromagnetic isotope separation. Initially, Kurchatov insisted working without foreign data on isotope separation and was aiming to produce material using the gas centrifuges but the gas centrifuge machine would be available to the Soviets only much later. Facing a tighter deadline from Stalin, Kurchatov relied upon foreign data by choosing the Gaseous diffusion method to produce the fissile material, a move that irked Pyotr Kapitsa who raised objections against this but was dismissed.

During the early years, the Soviet program suffered from many setbacks due to logistical failures and lack of commitment by the Soviet establishment but received later full support - after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. In 1942, Kurchatov was informed of results obtained from Chicago Pile-1 by the Soviet intelligence, and provided his view of making a nuclear bomb. In 1945, Kurchatov became involved in designing and building the first reactor at Laboratory No. 2 which sustained the nuclear chain reaction in late 1946. Together with Alikhanov and Flerov, Kurchatov authored a paper on the production of plutonium in a uranium graphite reactor. In 1947, Kurchatov worked with Isaak Kikoin to verify the calculations of the foreign data received on the American program.

In 1946, the Soviet program was aggressively pursued under Lavrentiy Beria, who (like Kapitsa) had a conflict with Kurchatov over his reliance on design data provided by Klaus Fuchs, a German physicist in the American Manhattan Project, to meet Stalin&#x27;s deadline. The design of the first Soviet nuclear device town of Sarov in the Gorki Oblast (now Nizhny Novgorod Oblast), on the Volga, was started and renamed &quot;Arzamas-16&quot;. Kurchatov recruited Yulii Khariton (who first resisted but joined the program) and Yakov Zel&#x27;dovich, and Kurchatov vigorously defended their deuterium calculations, insisting that the data could not be more accurate on cross section estimates.

The team was assisted by public disclosures made by the US government as well as by further information supplied by Fuchs. However, Kurchatov and Beria feared that the intelligence was disinformation and so insisted that their scientists retest everything themselves. Beria, in particular, would use the intelligence as a third-party check on the conclusions of the teams of scientists.

===RDS-1===

The Russian spies in the United States greatly aided in providing the key data on American nuclear devices, which allowed Kurchatov to avoid time-consuming and expensive trial and error problems. The fissile material was obtained from using the gaseous diffusion and implosion-type plutonium core that Kurchatov spent most of his time on. Furthermore, the German nuclear physicists were instrumental in speeding the acquisition of device data, and were employed under Kurchatov&#x27;s guidance.

Final device assembly was overseen by Yulii Khariton who had a device moved to a knock-down subassembly in Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.

On 29 August 1949, Kurchatov and his team successfully detonated its initial test device RDS-1 (a plutonium implosion bomb) at the Semipalatinsk Test Site– the device was codenamed RDS-1 (РДС–1) by Kurchatov which was approved by Soviet establishment. Kurchatov later remarked that his main feeling at the time to be one of relief.

In 1950, the work on thermonuclear weapon was started by Khariton, Sakharov, Zel&#x27;dovich, Tamm, and others working under Kurchatov&#x27;s leadership at Arzamas-16. Kurchatov aided in calculations but most work was done by Vitaly Ginzburg, Andrei Sakharov, Khariton, and Zel&#x27;dovich who had the most credit in developing the design for the thermonuclear device, known as RDS-6, which was detonated in 1953.

By the time RDS-1 exploded, Kurchatov had decided to work on nuclear power generation, working closely with engineer Nikolay Dollezhal, which would established the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant, near Moscow. The site was opened in 1954, which was known for its kind and was the first nuclear power plant in the world. His knowledge on naval architecture undoubtedly helped him in designing the first civilian nuclear ship, the &quot;Lenin&quot;.

After Stalin&#x27;s death and the execution of Beria, Kurchatov began to speak about the dangers of nuclear war, of nuclear weapon testing and visited England where he spoke in favour of greater interaction between Russian and Western scientists on nuclear fusion applications.

==Death==
In January 1949, Kurchatov was involved in a serious radiation accident which became a catastrophe at Chelyabinsk-40, in which it is possible that even more people died than at Chernobyl. In an effort to save the uranium load and reduce losses in the production of plutonium, Kurchatov, without proper safety gear, was the first to step into the central hall of the damaged reactor full of radioactive gases. After 1950, Kurchatov&#x27;s health sharply declined and he suffered a stroke in 1954 and died in Moscow of a cardiac embolism on 7 February 1960 aged 57. He was cremated and his ashes were buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on Red Square.

==Legacy and honors==
During his time in Soviet nuclear program, Kurchatov swore he would not cut his beard until the Soviet program succeeded, and he continued to wear a large beard (often cut into eccentric styles) for the remainder of his life, earning him the nickname &quot;The Beard&quot;. Kurchatov was a communist who had a portrait of Stalin by the time he died, and a member of Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Two towns bear his name: Kurchatov Township in Kazakhstan, and Kurchatov near Kursk (the site of a nuclear power station), the Kurchatov Institute is named in his honour, and bears a large monument dedicated to him at the entrance. The crater Kurchatov on the Moon and the asteroid 2352 Kurchatov are also named after him. Many of his students also enjoyed distinguished careers, among them Andrei Sakharov, Viktor Adamsky, Yuri Babayev, Yuri Trutnev and .

For his part in establishing the Soviet nuclear program, in accordance with state decree 627-258, Kurchatov was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, the Stalin Prize First Class, the sum of 500,000 rubles (besides the earlier results of (50%) premium in the amount of 500,000 rubles) and a ZIS-110 car, a private house and cottage furnished by the state, a doubling of his salary and &quot;the right (for life for him and his wife) to free travel by rail, water and air transport in the USSR&quot;. In all, he was:

*Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (elected in 1943)
*Three times Hero of Socialist Labor (1949, 1951, 1954)
*Awarded five Orders of Lenin 
*Awarded two Orders of the Red Banner
*Awarded the following medals: &quot;For Victory over Germany&quot;, &quot;For the defense of Sevastopol&quot;
*Four times recipient of the Stalin Prize (1942, 1949, 1951, 1954) 
*Recipient of the Lenin Prize (1957).

Kurchatov was buried in the Kremlin Wall in Moscow, a burial place reserved for top Soviet officials. In 1960 his institute was renamed to the I.V. Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, and in 1991 to the Russian Research Centre Kurchatov Institute. The Kurchatov Medal was established by the Academy of Sciences for outstanding work in nuclear physics. In the Transfermium Wars element naming controversy, the USSR&#x27;s proposed name for element 104 was &quot;kurchatovium&quot;, Ku, in honor of Kurchatov. Element 104 is now known as rutherfordium.

<doc id="222568" wikidata="Q155467" url="?curid=222568" title="Tōru Takemitsu">
<text>was a Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory. Largely self-taught, Takemitsu was admired for the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is known for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy and for fusing sound with silence and tradition with innovation.

He composed several hundred independent works of music, scored more than ninety films and published twenty books. He was also a founding member of the &quot;Jikken Kōbō&quot; (Experimental Workshop) in Japan, a group of avant-garde artists who distanced themselves from academia and whose collaborative work is often regarded among the most influential of the 20th century.

His 1957 &quot;Requiem&quot; for string orchestra attracted international attention, led to several commissions from across the world and established his reputation as the leading 20th-century Japanese composer. He was the recipient of numerous awards and honours and the Toru Takemitsu Composition Award is named after him.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Takemitsu was born in Tokyo on 8 October 1930; a month later his family moved to Dalian in the Chinese province of Liaoning. In 1938 he returned to Japan to attend elementary school, but his education was cut short by military conscription in 1944. Takemitsu described his experience of military service at such a young age, under the Japanese Nationalist government, as &quot;... extremely bitter&quot;. Takemitsu first became conscious of Western classical music during his term of military service, in the form of a popular French Song (&quot;Parlez-moi d&#x27;amour&quot;) which he listened to with colleagues in secret, played on a gramophone with a makeshift needle fashioned from bamboo.

During the post-war U.S. occupation of Japan, Takemitsu worked for the U.S. Armed Forces, but was ill for a long period. Hospitalised and bed-ridden, he took the opportunity to listen to as much Western music as he could on the U.S. Armed Forces network. While deeply affected by these experiences of Western music, he simultaneously felt a need to distance himself from the traditional music of his native Japan. He explained much later, in a lecture at the New York International Festival of the Arts, that for him Japanese traditional music &quot;always recalled the bitter memories of war&quot;.

Despite his lack of musical training, and taking inspiration from what little Western music he had heard, Takemitsu began to compose in earnest at the age of 16: &quot;... I began [writing] music attracted to music itself as one human being. Being in music I found my raison d&#x27;être as a man. After the war, music was the &quot;only&quot; thing. Choosing to be in music clarified my identity.&quot; Though he studied briefly with Yasuji Kiyose beginning in 1948, Takemitsu remained largely self-taught throughout his musical career.

===Early development and Jikken Kōbō===
In 1948, Takemitsu conceived the idea of electronic music technology, or in his own words, to &quot;bring noise into tempered musical tones inside a busy small tube.&quot; During the 1950s, Takemitsu had learned that in 1948 &quot;a French [engineer] Pierre Schaeffer invented the method(s) of &quot;musique concrète&quot; based on the same idea as mine. I was pleased with this coincidence.&quot;

In 1951, Takemitsu was a founding member of the anti-academic : an artistic group established for multidisciplinary collaboration on mixed-media projects, who sought to avoid Japanese artistic tradition. The performances and works undertaken by the group introduced several contemporary Western composers to Japanese audiences. During this period he wrote &quot;Saegirarenai Kyūsoku I&quot; (&quot;Uninterrupted Rest I&quot;, 1952: a piano work, without a regular rhythmic pulse or barlines); and by 1955 Takemitsu had begun to use electronic tape-recording techniques in such works as &quot;Relief Statique&quot; (1955) and &quot;Vocalism A·I&quot; (1956). Takemitsu also studied in the early 1950s with the composer Fumio Hayasaka, perhaps best known for the scores he wrote for films by Kenji Mizoguchi and Akira Kurosawa, the latter of whom Takemitsu would collaborate with decades later.

In the late 1950s chance brought Takemitsu international attention: his &quot;Requiem&quot; for string orchestra (1957), written as an homage to Hayasaka, was heard by Igor Stravinsky in 1958 during his visit to Japan. (The NHK had organised opportunities for Stravinsky to listen to some of the latest Japanese music; when Takemitsu&#x27;s work was put on by mistake, Stravinsky insisted on hearing it to the end.) At a press conference later, Stravinsky expressed his admiration for the work, praising its &quot;sincerity&quot; and &quot;passionate&quot; writing. Stravinsky subsequently invited Takemitsu to lunch; and for Takemitsu this was an &quot;unforgettable&quot; experience. After Stravinsky returned to the U.S., Takemitsu soon received a commission for a new work from the Koussevitsky Foundation which, he assumed, had come as a suggestion from Stravinsky to Aaron Copland. For this he composed &quot;Dorian Horizon&quot;, (1966), which was premièred by the San Francisco Symphony, conducted by Copland.

===Influence of Cage; interest in traditional Japanese music===
During his time with Jikken Kōbō, Takemitsu came into contact with the experimental work of John Cage; but when the composer Toshi Ichiyanagi returned from his studies in America in 1961, he gave the first Japanese performance of Cage&#x27;s &quot;Concert for Piano and Orchestra&quot;. This left a &quot;deep impression&quot; on Takemitsu: he recalled the impact of hearing the work when writing an obituary for Cage, 31 years later. This encouraged Takemitsu in his use of indeterminate procedures and graphic-score notation, for example in the graphic scores of &quot;Ring&quot; (1961), &quot;Corona for pianist(s)&quot; and &quot;Corona II for string(s)&quot; (both 1962). In these works each performer is presented with cards printed with coloured circular patterns which are freely arranged by the performer to create &quot;the score&quot;.

Although the immediate influence of Cage&#x27;s procedures did not last in Takemitsu&#x27;s music—&quot;Coral Island&quot;, for example for soprano and orchestra (1962) shows significant departures from indeterminate procedures partly as a result of Takemitsu&#x27;s renewed interest in the music of Anton Webern—certain similarities between Cage&#x27;s philosophies and Takemitsu&#x27;s thought remained. For example, Cage&#x27;s emphasis on timbres within individual sound-events, and his notion of silence &quot;as plenum rather than vacuum&quot;, can be aligned with Takemitsu&#x27;s interest in &quot;ma&quot;. Furthermore, Cage&#x27;s interest in Zen practice (through his contact with Zen scholar Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki) seems to have resulted in a renewed interest in the East in general, and ultimately alerted Takemitsu to the potential for incorporating elements drawn from Japanese traditional music into his composition:
I must express my deep and sincere gratitude to John Cage. The reason for this is that in my own life, in my own development, for a long period I struggled to avoid being &quot;Japanese&quot;, to avoid &quot;Japanese&quot; qualities. It was largely through my contact with John Cage that I came to recognize the value of my own tradition.
For Takemitsu, as he explained later in a lecture in 1988, one performance of Japanese traditional music stood out:
One day I chanced to see a performance of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.
Thereafter, he resolved to study all types of traditional Japanese music, paying special attention to the differences between the two very different musical traditions, in a diligent attempt to &quot;bring forth the sensibilities of Japanese music that had always been within [him]&quot;. This was no easy task, since in the years following the war traditional music was largely overlooked and ignored: only one or two &quot;masters&quot; continued to keep their art alive, often meeting with public indifference. In conservatoria across the country, even students of traditional instruments were always required to learn the piano.
From the early 1960s, Takemitsu began to make use of traditional Japanese instruments in his music, and even took up playing the &quot;biwa&quot;—an instrument he used in his score for the film &quot;Seppuku&quot; (1962). In 1967, Takemitsu received a commission from the New York Philharmonic, to commemorate the orchestra&#x27;s 125th anniversary, for which he wrote &quot;November Steps&quot; for &quot;biwa&quot;, &quot;shakuhachi&quot;, and orchestra. Initially, Takemitsu had great difficulty in uniting these instruments from such different musical cultures in one work. &quot;Eclipse&quot; for &quot;biwa&quot; and &quot;shakuhachi&quot; (1966) illustrates Takemitsu&#x27;s attempts to find a viable notational system for these instruments, which in normal circumstances neither sound together nor are used in works notated in any system of Western staff notation.

The first performance of &quot;November Steps&quot; was given in 1967, under Seiji Ozawa. Despite the trials of writing such an ambitious work, Takemitsu maintained &quot;that making the attempt was very worthwhile because what resulted somehow liberated music from a certain stagnation and brought to music something distinctly new and different&quot;. The work was distributed widely in the West when it was coupled as the fourth side of an LP release of Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalîla Symphony&quot;.

In 1972, Takemitsu, accompanied by Iannis Xenakis, Betsy Jolas, and others, heard Balinese gamelan music in Bali. The experience influenced the composer on a largely philosophical and theological level. For those accompanying Takemitsu on the expedition (most of whom were French musicians), who &quot;... could not keep their composure as I did before this music: it was too foreign for them to be able to assess the resulting discrepancies with their logic&quot;, the experience was without precedent. For Takemitsu, however, by now quite familiar with his own native musical tradition, there was a relationship between &quot;the sounds of the gamelan, the tone of the &quot;kapachi&quot;, the unique scales and rhythms by which they are formed, and Japanese traditional music which had shaped such a large part of my sensitivity&quot;. In his solo piano work &quot;For Away&quot; (written for Roger Woodward in 1973), a single, complex line is distributed between the pianist&#x27;s hands, which reflects the interlocking patterns between the metallophones of a gamelan orchestra.

A year later, Takemitsu returned to the instrumental combination of &quot;shakuhachi&quot;, &quot;biwa&quot;, and orchestra, in the less well known work &quot;Autumn&quot; (1973). The significance of this work is revealed in its far greater integration of the traditional Japanese instruments into the orchestral discourse; whereas in &quot;November Steps&quot;, the two contrasting instrumental ensembles perform largely in alternation, with only a few moments of contact. Takemitsu expressed this change in attitude:

But now my attitude is getting to be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common ... &quot;Autumn&quot; was written after &quot;November Steps&quot;. I really wanted to do something which I hadn&#x27;t done in &quot;November Steps&quot;, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.
===International status and the gradual shift in style===

By 1970, Takemitsu&#x27;s reputation as a leading member of avant-garde community was well established, and during his involvement with Expo &#x27;70 in Osaka, he was at last able to meet more of his Western colleagues, including Karlheinz Stockhausen. Also, during a contemporary music festival in April 1970, produced by the Japanese composer himself (&quot;Iron and Steel Pavilion&quot;), Takemitsu met among the participants Lukas Foss, Peter Sculthorpe, and Vinko Globokar. Later that year, as part of a commission from Paul Sacher and the Zurich Collegium Musicum, Takemitsu incorporated into his &quot;Eucalypts I&quot; parts for international performers: flautist Aurèle Nicolet, oboist Heinz Holliger, and harpist Ursula Holliger.

Critical examination of the complex instrumental works written during this period for the new generation of &quot;contemporary soloists&quot; reveals the level of his high-profile engagement with the Western avant-garde, in works such as &quot;Voice&quot; for solo flute (1971), &quot;Waves&quot; for clarinet, horn, two trombones and bass drum (1976), &quot;Quatrain&quot; for clarinet, violin, cello, piano and orchestra (1977). Experiments and works that incorporated traditional Japanese musical ideas and language continued to appear in his output, and an increased interest in the traditional Japanese garden began to reflect itself in works such as &quot;&quot; for &quot;gagaku&quot; orchestra (1973), and &quot;A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden&quot; for orchestra (1977).

Throughout this apogee of avant-garde work, Takemitsu&#x27;s musical style seems to have undergone a series of stylistic changes. Comparison of &quot;Green&quot; (for orchestra, 1967) and &quot;A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden&quot; (1977) quickly reveals the seeds of this change. The latter was composed according to a pre-compositional scheme, in which pentatonic modes were superimposed over one central pentatonic scale (the so-called &quot;black-key pentatonic&quot;) around a central sustained central pitch (F-sharp), and an approach that is highly indicative of the sort of &quot;pantonal&quot; and modal pitch material seen gradually emerging in his works throughout the 1970s. The former, &quot;Green&quot; (or &quot;November Steps II&quot;) written 10 years earlier, is heavily influenced by Debussy, and is, in spite of its very dissonant language (including momentary quarter-tone clusters), largely constructed through a complex web of modal forms. These modal forms are largely audible, particularly in the momentary repose toward the end of the work. Thus in these works, it is possible to see both a continuity of approach, and the emergence of a simpler harmonic language that was to characterise the work of his later period.

His friend and colleague Jō Kondō said, &quot;If his later works sound different from earlier pieces, it is due to his gradual refining of his basic style rather than any real alteration of it.&quot;

===Later works: the sea of tonality===

In a Tokyo lecture given in 1984, Takemitsu identified a melodic motive in his &quot;Far Calls. Coming Far!&quot; (for violin and orchestra, 1980) that would recur throughout his later works:
I wanted to plan a tonal &quot;sea&quot;. Here the &quot;sea&quot; is E-flat [&quot;Es&quot; in German nomenclature]-E-A, a three-note ascending motive consisting of a half step and perfect fourth. [... In &quot;Far Calls&quot;] this is extended upward from A with two major thirds and one minor third ... Using these patterns I set the &quot;sea of tonality&quot; from which many pantonal chords flow.
Takemitsu&#x27;s words here highlight his changing stylistic trends from the late 1970s into the 1980s, which have been described as &quot;an increased use of diatonic material [... with] references to tertian harmony and jazz voicing&quot;, which do not, however, project a sense of &quot;large-scale tonality&quot;. Many of the works from this period have titles that include a reference to water: &quot;Toward the Sea&quot; (1981), &quot;Rain Tree&quot; and &quot;Rain Coming&quot; (1982), &quot;riverrun&quot; and &quot;I Hear the Water Dreaming&quot; (1987). Takemitsu wrote in his notes for the score of &quot;Rain Coming&quot; that &quot;... the complete collection [is] entitled &quot;Waterscape&quot; ... it was the composer&#x27;s intention to create a series of works, which like their subject, pass through various metamorphoses, culminating in a sea of tonality.&quot; Throughout these works, the S-E-A motive (discussed further below) features prominently, and points to an increased emphasis on the melodic element in Takemitsu&#x27;s music that began during this later period.

His 1981 work for orchestra named &quot;Dreamtime&quot; was inspired by a visit to Groote Eylandt, off the coast of the Northern Territory of Australia, to witness a large gathering of Australian indigenous dancers, singers and story tellers. He was there at the invitation of the choreographer Jiří Kylián.

Pedal notes played an increasingly prominent role in Takemitsu&#x27;s music during this period, as in &quot;A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden&quot;. In &quot;Dream/Window&quot;, (orchestra, 1985) a pedal D serves as anchor point, holding together statements of a striking four-note motivic gesture which recurs in various instrumental and rhythmic guises throughout. Very occasionally, fully fledged references to diatonic tonality can be found, often in harmonic allusions to early- and pre-20th-century composers—for example, &quot;Folios&quot; for guitar (1974), which quotes from J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, and &quot;Family Tree&quot; for narrator and orchestra (1984), which invokes the musical language of Maurice Ravel and American popular song. (He revered the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, and would play through it on the piano before commencing a new work, as a form of &quot;purificatory ritual&quot;.)

By this time, Takemitsu&#x27;s incorporation of traditional Japanese (and other Eastern) musical traditions with his Western style had become much more integrated. Takemitsu commented, &quot;There is no doubt ... the various countries and cultures of the world have begun a journey toward the geographic and historic unity of all peoples ... The old and new exist within me with equal weight.&quot;

Toward the end of his life, Takemitsu had planned to complete an opera, a collaboration with the novelist Barry Gifford and the director Daniel Schmid, commissioned by the Opéra National de Lyon in France. He was in the process of publishing a plan of its musical and dramatic structure with Kenzaburō Ōe, but he was prevented from completing it by his death at 65. He died of pneumonia on 20 February 1996, while undergoing treatment for bladder cancer.

==Personal life==
He was married to Asaka Takemitsu (formerly Wakayama) for 42 years. She first met Toru in 1951, cared for him when he was suffering from tuberculosis in his early twenties, then married him in 1954. They had one child, a daughter named Maki. Asaka attended most premieres of his music and published a memoir of their life together in 2010.

==Music==

Composers whom Takemitsu cited as influential in his early work include Claude Debussy, Anton Webern, Edgard Varèse, Arnold Schoenberg, and Olivier Messiaen. Messiaen in particular was introduced to him by fellow composer Toshi Ichiyanagi, and remained a lifelong influence. Although Takemitsu&#x27;s wartime experiences of nationalism initially discouraged him from cultivating an interest in traditional Japanese music, he showed an early interest in &quot;... the Japanese Garden in color spacing and form ...&quot;. The formal garden of the &quot;kaiyu-shiki&quot; interested him in particular.

He expressed his unusual stance toward compositional theory early on, his lack of respect for the &quot;trite rules of music, rules that are ... stifled by formulas and calculations&quot;; for Takemitsu it was of far greater importance that &quot;sounds have the freedom to breathe. ... Just as one cannot plan his life, neither can he plan music&quot;.

Takemitsu&#x27;s sensitivity to instrumental and orchestral timbre can be heard throughout his work, and is often made apparent by the unusual instrumental combinations he specified. This is evident in works such as &quot;November Steps&quot;, that combine traditional Japanese instruments, &quot;shakuhachi&quot; and &quot;biwa&quot;, with a conventional Western orchestra. It may also be discerned in his works for ensembles that make no use of traditional instruments, for example &quot;Quotation of Dream&quot; (1991), &quot;Archipelago S.&quot;, for 21 players (1993), and &quot;Arc I &amp; II&quot; (1963–66/1976). In these works, the more conventional orchestral forces are divided into unconventional &quot;groups&quot;. Even where these instrumental combinations were determined by the particular ensemble commissioning the work, &quot;Takemitsu&#x27;s genius for instrumentation (and genius it was, in my view) ...&quot;, in the words of Oliver Knussen, &quot;... creates the illusion that the instrumental restrictions are self-imposed&quot;.

===Influence of traditional Japanese music===
Takemitsu summarized his initial aversion to Japanese (and all non-Western) traditional musical forms in his own words: &quot;There may be folk music with strength and beauty, but I cannot be completely honest in this kind of music. I want a more active relationship to the present. (Folk music in a &#x27;contemporary style&#x27; is nothing but a deception).&quot; His dislike for the musical traditions of Japan in particular were intensified by his experiences of the war, during which Japanese music became associated with militaristic and nationalistic cultural ideals.

Nevertheless, Takemitsu incorporated some idiomatic elements of Japanese music in his very earliest works, perhaps unconsciously. One unpublished set of pieces, &quot;Kakehi&quot; (&quot;Conduit&quot;), written at the age of seventeen, incorporates the &quot;ryō&quot;, &quot;ritsu&quot; and &quot;insen&quot; scales throughout. When Takemitsu discovered that these &quot;nationalist&quot; elements had somehow found their way into his music, he was so alarmed that he later destroyed the works. Further examples can be seen for example in the quarter-tone glissandi of &quot;Masques I&quot; (for two flutes, 1959), which mirror the characteristic pitch bends of the &quot;shakuhachi&quot;, and for which he devised his own unique notation: a held note is tied to an enharmonic spelling of the same pitch class, with a portamento direction across the tie.
Other Japanese characteristics, including the further use of traditional pentatonic scales, continued to crop up elsewhere in his early works. In the opening bars of &quot;Litany&quot;, &quot;for Michael Vyner&quot;, a reconstruction from memory by Takemitsu of &quot;Lento in Due Movimenti&quot; (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is clearly visible in the upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis. The pitches of the opening melody combine to form the constituent notes of the ascending form of the Japanese &quot;in&quot; scale.

When, from the early 1960s, Takemitsu began to &quot;consciously apprehend&quot; the sounds of traditional Japanese music, he found that his creative process, &quot;the logic of my compositional thought[,] was torn apart&quot;, and nevertheless, &quot;hogaku [traditional Japanese music ...] seized my heart and refuses to release it&quot;. In particular, Takemitsu perceived that, for example, the sound of a single stroke of the &quot;biwa&quot; or single pitch breathed through the &quot;shakuhachi&quot;, could &quot;so transport our reason because they are of extreme complexity ... already complete in themselves&quot;. This fascination with the sounds produced in traditional Japanese music brought Takemitsu to his idea of &quot;ma&quot; (usually translated as the space between two objects), which ultimately informed his understanding of the intense quality of traditional Japanese music as a whole:

Just one sound can be complete in itself, for its complexity lies in the formulation of &quot;ma&quot;, an unquantifiable metaphysical space (duration) of dynamically tensed absence of sound. For example, in the performance of &quot;nō&quot;, the &quot;ma&quot; of sound and silence does not have an organic relation for the purpose of artistic expression. Rather, these two elements contrast sharply with one another in an immaterial balance.
In 1970, Takemitsu received a commission from the National Theatre of Japan to write a work for the &quot;gagaku&quot; ensemble of the Imperial Household; this was fulfilled in 1973, when he completed &quot;Shuteiga&quot; (&quot;In an Autumn Garden&quot;, although he later incorporated the work, as the fourth movement, into his 50-minute-long &quot;In an Autumn Garden—Complete Version&quot;). As well as being &quot;... the furthest removed from the West of any work he had written&quot;, While it introduces certain Western musical ideas to the Japanese court ensemble, the work represents the deepest of Takemitsu&#x27;s investigations into Japanese musical tradition, the lasting effects of which are clearly reflected in his works for conventional Western ensemble formats that followed.
In &quot;Garden Rain&quot; (1974, for brass ensemble), the limited and pitch-specific harmonic vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the &quot;shō&quot; (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu&#x27;s writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (the players are often required to hold notes to the limit of their breath capacity). In &quot;A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden&quot;, the characteristic timbres of the &quot;shō&quot; and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact transposition of the &quot;shō&#x27;s&quot; chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the &quot;hichiriki&quot; in &quot;gagaku&quot; ensembles.

===Influence of Messiaen===
The influence of Olivier Messiaen on Takemitsu was already apparent in some of Takemitsu&#x27;s earliest published works. By the time he composed &quot;Lento in Due Movimenti&quot;, (1950), Takemitsu had already come into possession of a copy of Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;8 Préludes&quot; (through Toshi Ichiyanagi), and the influence of Messiaen is clearly visible in the work, in the use of modes, the suspension of regular metre, and sensitivity to timbre. Throughout his career, Takemitsu often made use of modes from which he derived his musical material, both melodic and harmonic among which Messiaen&#x27;s modes of limited transposition to appear with some frequency. In particular, the use of the octatonic, (mode II, or the 8–28 collection), and mode VI (8–25) is particularly common. However, Takemitsu pointed out that he had used the octatonic collection in his music before ever coming across it in Messiaen&#x27;s music.

In 1975, Takemitsu met Messiaen in New York, and during &quot;what was to be a one-hour &#x27;lesson&#x27; [but which] lasted three hours ... Messiaen played his &quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot; for Takemitsu at the piano&quot;, which, Takemitsu recalled, was like listening to an orchestral performance. Takemitsu responded to this with his homage to the French composer, &quot;Quatrain&quot;, for which he asked Messiaen&#x27;s permission to use the same instrumental combination for the main quartet, cello, violin, clarinet and piano (which is accompanied by orchestra). As well as the obvious similarity of instrumentation, Takemitsu employs several melodic figures that appear to &quot;mimic&quot; certain musical examples given by Messiaen in his &quot;Technique de mon langage musical&quot;, (see ex. 4). In 1977, Takemitsu reworked &quot;Quatrain&quot; for quartet alone, without orchestra, and titled the new work &quot;Quatrain II.&quot;

On hearing of Messiaen&#x27;s death in 1992, Takemitsu was interviewed by telephone, and still in shock, &quot;blurted out, &#x27;His death leaves a crisis in contemporary music!&#x27;&quot; Then later, in an obituary written for the French composer in the same year, Takemitsu further expressed his sense of loss at Messiaen&#x27;s death: &quot;Truly, he was my spiritual mentor ... Among the many things I learned from his music, the concept and experience of color and the form of time will be unforgettable.&quot; The composition &quot;Rain Tree Sketch II&quot;, which was to be Takemitsu&#x27;s final piano piece, was also written that year and subtitled &quot;In Memoriam Olivier Messiaen&quot;.

===Influence of Debussy===

Takemitsu frequently expressed his indebtedness to Claude Debussy, referring to the French composer as his &quot;great mentor&quot;. As Arnold Whittall puts it:
Given the enthusiasm for the exotic and the Orient in these [Debussy and Messiaen] and other French composers, it is understandable that Takemitsu should have been attracted to the expressive and formal qualities of music in which flexibility of rhythm and richness of harmony count for so much.
For Takemitsu, Debussy&#x27;s &quot;greatest contribution was his unique orchestration which emphasizes colour, light and shadow ... the orchestration of Debussy has many musical focuses.&quot; He was fully aware of Debussy&#x27;s own interest in Japanese art, (the cover of the first edition of &quot;La mer&quot;, for example, was famously adorned by Hokusai&#x27;s &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot;). For Takemitsu, this interest in Japanese culture, combined with his unique personality, and perhaps most importantly, his lineage as a composer of the French musical tradition running from Rameau and Lully through Berlioz in which colour is given special attention, gave Debussy his unique style and sense of orchestration.

During the composition of &quot;Green&quot; (&quot;November Steps II&quot;, for orchestra, 1967: &quot;steeped in the sound-color world of the orchestral music of Claude Debussy&quot;) Takemitsu said he had taken the scores of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;Après-midi d&#x27;un Faune&quot; and &quot;Jeux&quot; to the mountain villa where both this work and &quot;November Steps I&quot; were composed. For Oliver Knussen, &quot;the final appearance of the main theme irresistibly prompts the thought that Takemitsu may, quite unconsciously, have been attempting a latter-day Japanese &quot;Après-midi d&#x27;un Faune&quot;&quot;. Details of orchestration in &quot;Green&quot;, such as the prominent use of antique cymbals, and &quot;tremolandi&quot; harmonies in the strings, clearly point to the influence of Takemitsu&#x27;s compositional mentor, and of these works in particular.

In &quot;Quotation of Dream&quot; (1991), direct quotations from Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La Mer&quot; and Takemitsu&#x27;s earlier works relating to the sea are incorporated into the musical flow (&quot;stylistic jolts were not intended&quot;), depicting the landscape outside the Japanese garden of his own music.

===Motives===

Several recurring musical motives can be heard in Takemitsu&#x27;s works. In particular the pitch motive E♭–E–A can be heard in many of his later works, whose titles refer to water in some form (&quot;Toward the Sea&quot;, 1981; &quot;Rain Tree Sketch&quot;, 1982; &quot;I Hear the Water Dreaming&quot;, 1987).

When spelt in German (Es–E–A), the motive can be seen as a musical &quot;transliteration&quot; of the word &quot;sea&quot;. Takemitsu used this motive (usually transposed) to indicate the presence of water in his &quot;musical landscapes&quot;, even in works whose titles do not directly refer to water, such as &quot;A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden&quot; (1977; see ex. 5).

===&quot;Musique concrète&quot;===

During Takemitsu&#x27;s years as a member of the Jikken Kōbō, he experimented with compositions of &quot;musique concrète&quot; (and a very limited amount of electronic music, the most notable example being &quot;Stanza II&quot; for harp and tape written later in 1972). In &quot;Water Music&quot; (1960), Takemitsu&#x27;s source material consisted entirely of sounds produced by droplets of water. His manipulation of these sounds, through the use of highly percussive envelopes, often results in a resemblance to traditional Japanese instruments, such as the &quot;tsuzumi&quot; and &quot;nō&quot; ensembles.

===Aleatory techniques===

One aspect of John Cage&#x27;s compositional procedure that Takemitsu continued to use throughout his career, was the use of indeterminacy, in which performers are given a degree of choice in what to perform. As mentioned previously, this was particularly used in works such as &quot;November Steps&quot;, in which musicians playing traditional Japanese instruments were able to play in an orchestral setting with a certain degree of improvisational freedom.
However, he also employed a technique that is sometimes called &quot;aleatory counterpoint&quot; in his well-known orchestral work &quot;A Flock Descends Into the Pentagonal Garden&quot; (1977, at [J] in the score), and in the score of &quot;Arc II: i Textures&quot; (1964) for piano and orchestra, in which sections of the orchestra are divided into groups, and required to repeat short passages of music at will. In these passages the overall sequence of events is, however, controlled by the conductor, who is instructed about the approximate durations for each section, and who indicates to the orchestra when to move from one section to next. The technique is commonly found in the work of Witold Lutosławski, who pioneered it in his &quot;Jeux vénitiens&quot;.

===Film music===

Takemitsu&#x27;s contribution to film music was considerable; in under 40 years he composed music for over 100 films, some of which were written for purely financial reasons (such as those written for Noboru Nakamura). However, as the composer attained financial independence, he grew more selective, often reading whole scripts before agreeing to compose the music, and later surveying the action on set, &quot;breathing the atmosphere&quot; whilst conceiving his musical ideas.

One notable consideration in Takemitsu&#x27;s composition for film was his careful use of silence (also important in many of his concert works), which often immediately intensifies the events on screen, and prevents any monotony through a continuous musical accompaniment. For the first battle scene of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Ran&quot;, Takemitsu provided an extended passage of intense elegiac quality that halts at the sound of a single gunshot, leaving the audience with the pure &quot;sounds of battle: cries screams and neighing horses&quot;.

Takemitsu attached the greatest importance to the director&#x27;s conception of the film; in an interview with Max Tessier, he explained that, &quot;everything depends on the film itself ... I try to concentrate as much as possible on the subject, so that I can express what the director feels himself. I try to extend his feelings with my music.&quot;

==Legacy==
In a memorial issue of &quot;Contemporary Music Review&quot;, Jō Kondō wrote, &quot;Needless to say, Takemitsu is among the most important composers in Japanese music history. He was also the first Japanese composer fully recognized in the west, and remained the guiding light for the younger generations of Japanese composers.&quot;

Composer Peter Lieberson shared the following in his program note to &quot;The Ocean that has no East and West&quot;, written in memory of Takemitsu: &quot;I spent the most time with Toru in Tokyo when I was invited to be a guest composer at his Music Today Festival in 1987. Peter Serkin and composer Oliver Knussen were also there, as was cellist Fred Sherry. Though he was the senior of our group by many years, Toru stayed up with us every night and literally drank us under the table. I was confirmed in my impression of Toru as a person who lived his life like a traditional Zen poet.&quot;

On the death of his friend, the pianist Roger Woodward composed &quot;In Memoriam Toru Takemitsu&quot; for unaccompanied violoncello. Woodward recalled concerts with Takemitsu in Australia, the Decca Studios and Roundhouse, London and at the 1976 &#x27; Music Today&#x27;  Festival, with Kinshi Tsuruta and Katsuya Yokoyama; Takemitu&#x27;s dedication of  &quot;For Away&quot;, &quot;Corona&quot; (London Version) and &quot;Undisturbed Rest&quot; and of the inspirational leadership he provided Woodward&#x27;s generation: &quot; From all composers with whom I ever worked it was Toru Takemitsu who understood the inner workings of music and sound on a level unmatched by anyone else. His profound humility concealed an immense knowledge of Occidental and Oriental cultures which greatly extended historical contributions of Debussy and Messiaen.&quot;

His complete piano works have been recorded, among others by the Indonesian pianist and composer Ananda Sukarlan who had worked with him during Takemitsu&#x27;s last visits to Europe in his last years.

In the foreword to a selection of Takemitsu&#x27;s writings in English, conductor Seiji Ozawa writes: &quot;I am very proud of my friend Toru Takemitsu. He is the first Japanese composer to write for a world audience and achieve international recognition.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
Takemitsu won awards for composition, both in Japan and abroad, including the Prix Italia for his orchestral work &quot;Tableau noir&quot; in 1958, the Otaka Prize in 1976 and 1981, the Los Angeles Film Critics Award in 1987 (for the film score &quot;Ran&quot;) and the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition in 1994 (for &quot;Fantasma/Cantos&quot;). In Japan, he received the Film Awards of the Japanese Academy for outstanding achievement in music, for soundtracks to the following films:
* 1979 
* 1985 Fire Festival (film)
* 1986 
* 1990 
* 1996 

He was also invited to attend numerous international festivals throughout his career, and presented lectures and talks at academic institutions across the world. He was made an honorary member of the Akademie der Künste of the DDR in 1979, and the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1985. He was admitted to the French &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; in 1985, and the &quot;Académie des Beaux-Arts&quot; in 1986. He was the recipient of the 22nd Suntory Music Award (1990). Posthumously, Takemitsu received an Honorary Doctorate from Columbia University early in 1996 and was awarded the fourth Glenn Gould Prize in fall 1996.

The Toru Takemitsu Composition Award, intended to &quot;encourage a younger generation of composers who will shape the coming age through their new musical works&quot;, is named after him.

<text>Robert Bloomfield (3 December 1766 – 19 August 1823) was an English labouring-class poet, whose work is appreciated in the context of other self-educated writers, such as Stephen Duck, Mary Collier and John Clare.

==Life==
Robert Bloomfield was born into a poor family in the village of Honington, Suffolk. His father was a tailor, who died of smallpox when his son was a year old. It was from his mother Elizabeth, who kept the village school, that he received the rudiments of education.

Bloomfield was apprenticed at the age of eleven to his mother&#x27;s brother-in-law, and worked on a farm that was part of the estate of the Duke of Grafton, his future patron. Four years later, owing to his small and weak stature (in adulthood just five feet tall), he was sent to London to work as a shoemaker under his elder brother George. One of his early duties was to read the papers aloud while the others in the workshop were working, and he became particularly interested in the poetry section of &quot;The London Magazine&quot;. He had his first poem, &quot;The Village Girl&quot;, published in 1786. When his brother George returned to Suffolk in that year, he set up on his own as a cobbler and in 1790 married Mary Ann Church, by whom he was to have five children.

The poem that made his reputation, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Boy&quot;, was composed in a garret in Bell Alley, Coleman Street. It was influenced by James Thomson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Seasons&quot;. Bloomfield was able to carry in his head some fifty to a hundred finished lines of it at a time, until an opportunity arose to write them down. The manuscript was declined by several publishers and was eventually shown by his brother George to Capel Lofft, a radical Suffolk squire of literary tastes, who arranged for its publication with woodcuts by Thomas Bewick in 1800.

The success of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Boy&quot; was remarkable, over 25,000 copies being sold in the next two years. It was also reprinted in several American editions, appeared in German translation in Leipzig, in French as &quot;Le Valet du Fermier&quot; in Paris, and in Italian translation in Milan. There was even a Latin translation of parts of it – &quot;De Agricolae Puero, Anglicano Poemate celeberrimo excerptum, et in morem Latini Georgici redditum&quot; – made by the lively Suffolk vicar William Clubbe. The poem was particularly admired by the Suffolk-born painter John Constable, who used couplets from it as tags for two of his paintings: &quot;A Ploughing Scene&quot; (shown at the Royal Academy in 1814) and &quot;A Harvest Field, Reapers, Gleaners&quot; (shown at the British Institution in 1817), which he marked as derived from &quot;Bloomfield&#x27;s poem&quot;. It was also admired by Robert Southey, a Romantic poet and future poet laureate.
While this success helped to reduce his poverty for a while, it also took him away from his work. As a result, the Duke of Grafton, who lived at Euston Hall near the village of Bloomfield&#x27;s birth, settled on him a small annuity of £15 and used influence to gain him employment in the Seal Office to the King&#x27;s Bench Court and then at Somerset House, although he did not work for long at either. Meanwhile, Bloomfield&#x27;s reputation was increased by the appearance of his &quot;Rural Tales&quot; (1802), several poems of which were set to music by his brother Isaac. Another of them, &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Maid&quot;, was turned into an opera in 1804 by John Davy (1763–1824) and formed the basis for a two-act melodrama by John Faucit Saville in 1821. Other publications by Bloomfield included &quot;Good Tidings&quot; (in praise of inoculation at the instigation of Edward Jenner, 1804); &quot;Wild Flowers or Pastoral and Local Poetry&quot; (1806); and &quot;The Banks of the Wye&quot; (a poetic journal of a walking tour taken in the footsteps of Wordsworth, 1811).

Unfortunately Vernor and Hood, his publishers, failed, and in 1812 Bloomfield had to move from London into a cottage rented to him by a friend in the Bedfordshire village of Shefford. There one of his daughters died in 1814 and his wife became insane. To support himself, he tried to carry on a business as a bookseller but it failed, and in his later years he was reduced to making Aeolian harps, which he sold among his friends. With failing eyesight and his own reason threatened by depression, he died in great poverty on 19 August 1823. His collection of books and manuscripts, and his household effects, had to be auctioned to pay his debts and cover the funeral expenses. To assist in that fund-raising came the publication in that year of his drama, &quot;Hazlewood Hall&quot;, and in the following year of &quot;The Remains of Robert Bloomfield&quot;, which included writing for children, on which he had been working for some years, and a selection of his correspondence.
Robert Bloomfield is buried in the churchyard of the Church of All Saints in nearby Campton, Bedfordshire.

==Poetry==
Bloomfield&#x27;s poetry invites comparison with that of George Crabbe, who was also a native of Suffolk. Both wrote much in couplets of iambic pentameters, and both provide descriptions of rural life at its hardest and least inviting. Bloomfield, however, is more cheerful in tone and his verse is denser and more vigorous. Here, for instance, is the episode in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Boy&quot; where Giles chops up turnips to feed to the livestock in winter:
:::On GILES, and such as Giles, the labour falls,
:::To strew the frequent load where hunger calls.
:::On driving gales sharp hail indignant flies,
:::And sleet, more irksome still, assails his eyes;
:::Snow clogs his feet; or if no snow is seen,
:::The field with all its juicy store to screen,
:::Deep goes the frost, till every root is found
:::A rolling mass of ice upon the ground.
:::No tender ewe can break her nightly fast,
:::Nor heifer strong begin the cold repast,
:::Till Giles with pond&#x27;rous beetle foremost go,
:::And scatt&#x27;ring splinters fly at every blow;
:::When pressing round him, eager for the prize,
:::From their mixt breath warm exhalations rise.

However, such verse varies little from the work of many of Bloomfield&#x27;s contemporaries, such as James Montgomery and Ebenezer Elliot, whose names, like his, were well known in their time but are scarcely remembered now. Besides such formal productions, he told many light-hearted stories in octosyllabics, some of which are incidentally interesting for their employment of Suffolk dialect words, particularly in &quot;The Horkey&quot;. His work served as an inspiration to John Clare, who began publishing his own rural poetry in 1820 and praised Bloomfield&#x27;s highly.

Robert&#x27;s brother, Nathaniel, also published a collection of poetry in 1803, &quot;An Essay on War, in Blank Verse, and Other Poems&quot;. Byron commented on the brothers in &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot; (lines 775–786), linking Robert&#x27;s name favourably with other poets of humble beginnings such as Burns and Gifford, but dismissing Nathaniel&#x27;s writing as routine and uninspired. Byron returned to the charge in &quot;Hints from Horace&quot; with the apostrophe:
:::Hark to those lines, narcotically soft,
:::The cobbler-laureats sing to Capel Lofft! (lines 733–734)
Although a note makes it clear that Nathaniel is his principal target, he also seems to include his &quot;brother Bobby&quot; in the accusation that Lofft &quot;has spoiled some excellent shoemakers and been accessory to the poetic undoing of many of the industrious poor.&quot;

==Later reputation==
The Robert Bloomfield Masonic lodge No 8328 was founded in 1971 at Biggleswade Masonic Centre, where it continues to meet. Shefford&#x27;s secondary school, later a middle school (for pupils aged 9–13), was named after the poet. In 2000 the Robert Bloomfield Society was founded to promote awareness of his life and work and has encouraged scholarly publications relating to him. A revised and enlarged selection of his poems was published by Trent Editions in 2007. Recent studies see his poetry in its social as well as its literary context.

<text>A voxel is a three-dimensional counterpart to a pixel. It represents a value on a regular grid in a three-dimensional space. Voxels are frequently used in the visualization and analysis of medical and scientific data (e.g. geographic information systems (GIS)). They are also commonly used in video games, both as a technological feature, as in &quot;Outcast&quot;, and a graphical style, which was popularised by &quot;Minecraft&quot;.

As with pixels in a 2D bitmap, voxels themselves do not typically have their position (i.e. coordinates) explicitly encoded with their values. Instead, rendering systems infer the position of a voxel based upon its position relative to other voxels (i.e., its position in the data structure that makes up a single volumetric image). Some volumetric displays use voxels to describe their resolution. For example, a cubic volumetric display might be able to show 512×512×512 (or about 134 million) voxels.

In contrast to pixels and voxels, polygons are often explicitly represented by the coordinates of their vertices (as points). A direct consequence of this difference is that polygons can efficiently represent simple 3D structures with much empty or homogeneously filled space, while voxels excel at representing regularly sampled spaces that are non-homogeneously filled.

One of the definitions is: 

Voxel is an image of a three-dimensional space region limited by given sizes, which has its own &quot;nodal point&quot; coordinates in an accepted coordinate system, its own &quot;form&quot;, its own &quot;state parameter&quot; that indicates its belonging to some modeled object, and has &quot;properties&quot; of modeled region.
This definition has the following advantage. If fixed voxel form is used within the whole model it is much easier to operate with voxel &quot;nodal points&quot; (i.e. three coordinates of this point). Yet, there is the simple form of record: indexes of the elements in the model set (i.e. integer coordinates). Model set elements in this case are &quot;state parameters,&quot; indicating voxel belonging to the modeled object or its separate parts, including their surfaces.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;voxel&quot; originated by analogy to &quot;pixel&quot;, with &quot;vo&quot; representing &quot;volume&quot; (instead of pixel&#x27;s &quot;picture&quot;) and &quot;el&quot; representing &quot;element&quot;; a similar formation with &quot;el&quot; for &quot;element&quot; is the word &quot;texel&quot;.
The term &quot;hypervoxel&quot; is a generalization of voxel for higher-dimensional spaces.

== Rendering ==
A volume described as voxels can be visualized either by direct volume rendering or by the extraction of polygon iso-surfaces that follow the contours of given threshold values. The marching cubes algorithm is often used for iso-surface extraction, however other methods exist as well.

Both ray tracing and ray casting, as well as rasterisation, can be applied to voxel data to obtain 2D raster graphics to depict on a monitor.

=== Incremental error rasterisation ===

Another technique for voxels involves raster graphics where one simply raytraces every pixel of the display into the scene, tracking an error term to determine when to step. A typical implementation will raytrace each pixel of the display starting at the bottom of the screen using what is known as a y-buffer. When a voxel is reached that has a higher y value on the display it is added to the y-buffer overriding the previous value and connected with the previous y-value on the screen interpolating the color values. There is a major downside to voxel rasterization when transformation is applied which causes severe aliasing. The advantage was the ability to rasterise using cheap integer calculations on a CPU without hardware acceleration.

&quot;Outcast&quot;, and other 1990s video games employed this graphics technique for effects such as reflection and bump-mapping and usually for terrain rendering. &quot;Outcast&quot;&#x27;s graphics engine was mainly a combination of a ray casting (heightmap) engine, used to render the landscape, and a texture mapping polygon engine used to render objects. The &quot;Engine Programming&quot; section of the games credits in the manual has several subsections related to graphics, among them: &quot;Landscape Engine&quot;, &quot;Polygon Engine&quot;, &quot;Water &amp; Shadows Engine&quot; and &quot;Special effects Engine&quot;. Although &quot;Outcast&quot; is often cited as a forerunner of voxel technology, this is somewhat misleading. The game does not actually model three-dimensional volumes of voxels. Instead, it models the ground as a surface, which may be seen as being made up of voxels. The ground is decorated with objects that are modeled using texture-mapped polygons. When &quot;Outcast&quot; was developed, the term &quot;voxel engine&quot;, when applied to computer games, commonly referred to a ray casting engine (for example the &quot;VoxelSpace&quot; engine). On the engine technology page of the game&#x27;s website, the landscape engine is also referred to as the &quot;Voxels engine&quot;. The engine is purely software-based: it does not rely on hardware-acceleration via a 3D graphics card.

John Carmack also experimented with Voxels for the &quot;Quake III&quot; engine. One such problem cited by Carmack was the lack of graphics cards designed specifically for such rendering requiring them to be software rendered.

Comanche was also the first commercial flight simulation based on voxel technology. NovaLogic used the proprietary Voxel Space engine developed for the company by Kyle Freeman (written entirely in Assembly language) to create open landscapes. This rendering technique allowed for much more detailed and realistic terrain compared to simulations based on vector graphics at that time.

== Data ==
A voxel represents a single sample, or data point, on a regularly spaced, three-dimensional grid. This data point can consist of a single piece of data, such as an opacity, or multiple pieces of data, such as a color in addition to opacity. A voxel represents only a single point on this grid, not a volume; the space between each voxel is not represented in a voxel-based dataset. Depending on the type of data and the intended use for the dataset, this missing information may be reconstructed and/or approximated, e.g. via interpolation.
The value of a voxel may represent various properties. In CT scans, the values are Hounsfield units, giving the opacity of material to X-rays. Different types of value are acquired from MRI or ultrasound.

Voxels can contain multiple scalar values, essentially vector (tensor) data; in the case of ultrasound scans with B-mode and Doppler data, density, and volumetric flow rate are captured as separate channels of data relating to the same voxel positions.

While voxels provide the benefit of precision and depth of reality, they are typically large data sets and are unwieldy to manage given the bandwidth of common computers. However, through efficient compression and manipulation of large data files, interactive visualization can be enabled on consumer market computers.

Other values may be useful for immediate 3D rendering, such as a surface normal vector and color.

Technologies to extend voxels into 4 and 5 dimensions of data are under investigation.

== Uses ==
Uses of voxels include volumetric imaging in medicine and representation of terrain in games and simulations. Voxel terrain is used instead of a heightmap because of its ability to represent overhangs, caves, arches, and other 3D terrain features. These concave features cannot be represented in a heightmap due to only the top &#x27;layer&#x27; of data being represented, leaving everything below it filled (the volume that would otherwise be the inside of the caves, or the underside of arches or overhangs).

== Editors ==
While scientific volume visualization does not require modifying the actual voxel data, voxel editors can be used to create art (especially 3D pixel art) and models for voxel based games. Some editors are focused on a single approach to voxel editing while others mix various approaches. Some common approaches are:

* Slice based: The volume is sliced in one or more axes and the user can edit each image individually using 2D raster editor tools. These generally store color information in voxels.
* Sculpture: Similar to the vector counterpart but with no topology constraints. These usually store density information in voxels and lack color information.
* Building blocks: The user can add and remove blocks just like a construction set toy.
There are a few voxel editors available that are not tied to specific games or engines. They can be used as alternatives or complements to traditional 3D vector modeling.
== Extensions ==
A generalization of a voxel is the &quot;toxel&quot;, or temporal voxel. This is used in the case of a 4D dataset, for example, an image sequence that represents 3D space together with another dimension such as time. In this way, an image could contain 100×100×100×100 toxels, which could be seen as a series of 100 frames of a 100×100×100 volume image (the equivalent for a 3D image would be showing a 2D cross section of the image in each frame). Although storage and manipulation of such data requires large amounts of memory, it allows the representation and analysis of spacetime systems.

<text>Capel Lofft (sometimes spelled Capell; 14 November 1751 – 26 May 1824) was a British lawyer, writer and amateur astronomer.

==Life==
Born in London, he was educated at Eton College and Peterhouse, Cambridge. He trained as a lawyer at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, where he was called to the bar (qualified as a barrister) in 1775. In addition to his legal practice, he became a prolific writer on the law and political topics. In politics, he was an advocate of parliamentary and other reforms, identifying with the Foxite Whig faction. He also engaged in voluminous correspondence with prominent authors.

His legal career was ended by a case in Stanton, Suffolk. On the night of 3 October 1799, Sarah Lloyd, a 22 year old servant, was incited by a suitor to steal 40 shillings. She was caught, tried, and sentenced to death by hanging. Capel Lofft fought strenuously but unsuccessfully for a reprieve. Lloyd was to be executed on 23 April 1800 in Bury St Edmunds. Lofft accompanied the cart transporting Lloyd on that morning, holding an umbrella over Lloyd to shield her from rain, and remained by her side until she was hanged. The authorities took a dim view of Lofft&#x27;s fight on Lloyd&#x27;s behalf, and he was struck off the Roll (list of qualified lawyers).

Lofft wrote the preface to poet and former Quaker Thomas &#x27;Clio&#x27; Rickman&#x27;s &quot;An Ode, in Celebration of the Emancipation Of The Blacks of Saint Domingo, November 29, 1803&quot;. He commended Toussaint Louverture – &quot;of whom Posterity will know how to speak&quot; – and hoped that &quot;a Nation [Haiti] which has emerged into Freedom should prove itself capable and worthy of the blessings [sic] by its use of it&quot;. He became the patron of Robert Bloomfield, the author of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Boy&quot;, and was responsible for the publication of that work. Byron, in a note to his &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot;, ridiculed Lofft as &quot;the Maecenas of shoemakers and preface-writer general to distressed versemen; a kind of &quot;gratis accoucheur&quot; to those who wish to be delivered of rhyme, but do not know how to bring forth.&quot;

Lofft had an interest in astronomy and is known to have observed several transits and eclipses. These include the transits of Mercury on 7 May 1799 and 9 November 1802, the solar eclipses on 16 June 1806 and 19 November 1816, and the lunar eclipses on 4 December 1797 and 10 June 1816.

The deaths of Lofft&#x27;s father and uncle in 1811 left him with a large property and family estate. A supporter of Napoleon, he wrote letters to the editor of the Morning Chronicle (31 July and 10 August 1815) opposing the Government&#x27;s decision to send Napoleon to St Helena. Lofft attempted to serve a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; (a legal instrument against wrongful imprisonment) while the captive Napoleon was being held aboard a ship in Plymouth.

In 1816 Lofft moved to Europe for his daughters&#x27; education. He died in 1824 aged 72 at Montcalieri, near Turin. His &#x27;law and miscellaneous&#x27; library was auctioned in London by R. H. Evans (along with the books of Henry Cooper Esq) on 8 June 1825. A copy of the catalogue is at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.129(9)).

==Family==
Lofft married Anne, daughter of Henry Emlyn, in 1778. Their fourth son Capell Lofft the younger (1806–1873), was also a writer.

<text>Parque de las Ciencias Luis A. Ferré is an educational and recreational park located in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, owned by the Municipality of Bayamón, focused on STEAM education. It is one of multiple touristic attractions inaugurated under the leadership of longtime mayor Ramón Luis Rivera and is named after former Governor of Puerto Rico Luis A. Ferré. After two major closings, in November 2022, the Municipality of Bayamón announced the contracting of Educational Park Management as the new operator of the park which reopened on September 18, 2024.

==Park features==
The park occupies and connects with several main highways. Some of the main features of the park are a natural observatory set on a hill at 285 feet (87m) above sea level, a zoo, and an artificial lake. It also features exhibitions of archaeology, space exploration, transportation, science and health, among many others. The park also includes a section dedicated to late comedian José Miguel Agrelot and child entertainer Joaquín Monserrat, who was most famous for his character &quot;Pacheco&quot;. In October 2023, Educational Park Management announced a collaboration with Guinness World Records for a new attraction and exhibition at the park upon its reopening.

==Operations==
The park has had two major closings, the first from February 2011 to January 10, 2016, for renovations that cost $11 million, and the second closing in September 2017, due to the aftermath of both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria. In November 2022, the Municipality of Bayamón announced the contracting of Educational Park Management as the new operator of the park for a future reopening. The park officially reopened on September 18, 2024, at an estimated cost of $20 million and a corporate sponsorship from Claro Puerto Rico.

<text>The Army of the Potomac was the primary field army of the Union army in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. It was created in July 1861 shortly after the First Battle of Bull Run and was disbanded in June 1865 following the surrender of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in April.

==History==
The Army of the Potomac was founded in 1861. It initially was only the size of a corps relative to the size of Union armies later in the Civil War. Its nucleus was called the Army of Northeastern Virginia led by Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell. It fought and lost the Civil War&#x27;s first major battle, the First Battle of Bull Run. The arrival in Washington, D.C., of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan dramatically changed the makeup of that army. McClellan&#x27;s original assignment was to command the Division of the Potomac, which included the Department of Northeast Virginia under McDowell and the Department of Washington under Brig. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield.

On July 26, 1861, the Department of the Shenandoah, commanded by Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, was merged with McClellan&#x27;s departments and on that day, McClellan formed the Army of the Potomac, which was composed of all military forces in the former Departments of Northeastern Virginia, Washington, Pennsylvania, and the Shenandoah. The men under Banks&#x27;s command became an infantry division in the Army of the Potomac. The army started with four corps, but these were divided during the Peninsula Campaign to produce two more. After the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Army of the Potomac absorbed the units that had served under Maj. Gen. John Pope.

The belief that John Pope commanded the Army of the Potomac in the summer of 1862 after McClellan&#x27;s unsuccessful Peninsula Campaign is mistaken. On the contrary, Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia was built around different units, although three corps of the Army of the Potomac were sent to northern Virginia and were under Pope&#x27;s operational control during the Northern Virginia Campaign. During the time that the Army of Virginia existed, the Army of the Potomac was headquartered on the Virginia Peninsula, and then outside Washington, D.C., with McClellan still in command, although most of his troops had been temporarily reassigned. After Pope&#x27;s defeat at Second Bull Run, McClellan was given back his original units, plus most of the units of the Army of Virginia, which were integrated into the Army of the Potomacalthough not always successfully.

The Army of the Potomac underwent many structural changes during its existence. The army was divided by Ambrose Burnside into three grand divisions of two corps each with a Reserve composed of two more. Hooker abolished the grand divisions. Thereafter the individual corps, seven of which remained in Virginia, reported directly to army headquarters. Hooker also created a Cavalry Corps by combining units that previously had served as smaller formations. In late 1863, two corps were sent West, andin 1864the remaining five corps were recombined into three. Burnside&#x27;s IX Corps, which accompanied the army at the start of Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Overland Campaign, rejoined the army later. For more detail, see the section Corps below.

The Army of the Potomac fought in most of the Eastern Theater campaigns, primarily in (Eastern) Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. After the end of the war, it was disbanded on June 28, 1865, shortly following its participation in the Grand Review of the Armies.

The Army of the Potomac was also the name given to General P. G. T. Beauregard&#x27;s Confederate army during the early stages of the war (namely, First Bull Run; thus, the losing Union army ended up adopting the name of the winning Confederate army). However, the name was eventually changed to the Army of Northern Virginia, which became famous under General Robert E. Lee.

In 1869, the Society of the Army of the Potomac was formed as a veterans association. It had its last reunion in 1927.

==Noted units==

Because of its proximity to the nation&#x27;s largest cities at the time, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City, the Army of the Potomac received more contemporary media coverage than the other Union field armies. Such coverage produced fame for a number of this army&#x27;s units. Individual brigades, such as the Irish Brigade, the Philadelphia Brigade, the First New Jersey Brigade, the Vermont Brigade, and the Iron Brigade, were well known to the general public, both during and after the Civil War.

===Corps===
The army originally consisted of fifteen divisions, the Artillery Reserve and the Cavalry Command. Commanded by Edwin V. Sumner, William B. Franklin, Louis Blenker, Nathaniel P. Banks, Frederick W. Lander (replaced by James Shields after Lander&#x27;s death on March 2, 1862, Silas Casey, Irvin McDowell, Fitz John Porter, Samuel P. Heintzelman, Don Carlos Buell (replaced by Erasmus D. Keyes in November, 1861), William F. Smith, Joseph Hooker, John A. Dix, Charles P. Stone (replaced by John Sedgwick in February, 1862), George A. McCall, George Stoneman (replaced by Philip St. George Cooke in January, 1862) and Henry J. Hunt.

Because this arrangement would be too hard to control in battle, President Lincoln issued an order on March 13, 1862, dividing the army into five corps headed by MG Irvin McDowell (I Corps; Franklin&#x27;s Division: BG William B. Franklin, McCall&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvania Reserves&quot; Division: BG George A. McCall and McDowell&#x27;s old Division under BG Rufus King.), BG Edwin V. Sumner (II Corps; Sumner&#x27;s old Division under BG Israel B. Richardson, Sedgwick&#x27;s Division: BG John Sedgwick and Blenker&#x27;s Division: Louis Blenker.), BG Samuel P. Heintzelman (III Corps; Porter&#x27;s Division: BG Fitz John Porter, Hooker&#x27;s Division: BG Joseph Hooker and Heintzelman&#x27;s old Division under BG Charles S. Hamilton), BG Erasmus D. Keyes (IV Corps; Keyes&#x27; old Division under BG Darius N. Couch, Smith&#x27;s Division: BG William F. Smith and Casey&#x27;s Division: BG Silas Casey), MG Nathaniel P. Banks (V Corps, which later became the XII Corps; Banks&#x27; old Division under BG Alpheus S. Williams, Shield&#x27;s Division: BG James Shields and a Cavalry Division under BG John P. Hatch).

Lincoln named as corps commanders the five highest-ranking division commanders in the army. McClellan was unhappy with this, as he had intended to wait until the army had been tested in battle before judging which generals were suitable for corps command.

After the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, McClellan requested and obtained permission to create two additions corps; these became the V Corps, headed by BG Fitz-John Porter, and the VI Corps, headed by BG William B. Franklin, both personal favorites of his. After the First Battle of Kernstown in the Valley on March 23, the administration feared the threat to the national capital in Washington, D.C. from &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s force. To McClellan&#x27;s displeasure, it detached Blenker&#x27;s division from the II Corps and sent it to West Virginia, where it served under John C. Fremont&#x27;s command. McDowell&#x27;s I Corps was detached as well and stationed in the Rappahannock area.

In June 1862, George McCall&#x27;s division from I Corps (the Pennsylvania Reserves Division) was sent down to the Peninsula and temporarily attached to the V Corps. In the Seven Days Battles, the V Corps was heavily engaged. The Pennsylvania Reserves, in particular, suffered heavy losses including its division commander, who was captured by the Confederates, and two of its three brigadiers, John F. Reynolds, who was also captured, and George Meade, who was wounded. The III Corps fought at Glendale, however, the rest of the army was not heavily engaged in the week-long fight aside from Slocum&#x27;s division of the VI Corps, which was sent to reinforce the V Corps at Gaines Mill.

The Army of the Potomac remained on the Virginia Peninsula until August, when it was recalled back to Washington D.C. Keyes and one of the two IV Corps divisions were left behind permanently as part of the newly created Department of the James, while the other division, commanded by Brig. Gen Darius Couch, was attached to the VI Corps.

During the Second Battle of Bull Run, the III and V Corps were temporarily attached to Pope&#x27;s army; the former suffered major losses and was sent back to Washington to rest and refit afterward, so it did not participate in the Maryland Campaign. In the battle, Pope issued confusing orders to the V Corps, eventually directing them against Jackson&#x27;s flank, ignoring Longstreet&#x27;s troops on the Union flank. Pope blamed the defeat at Second Bull Run on Porter, who was court-martialed and spent much of his life seeking exoneration. Sigel&#x27;s command, now redesignated the XI Corps, also spent the Maryland Campaign in Washington resting and refitting.

In the Maryland Campaign, the Army of the Potomac had six corps. These were the I Corps, commanded by Joe Hooker after Irvin McDowell was removed from command, the II Corps, commanded by Edwin Sumner, the V Corps, headed by Fitz-John Porter, the VI Corps, headed by William Franklin, the IX Corps, headed by Ambrose Burnside and formerly the Department of North Carolina, and the XII Corps, headed by Nathaniel Banks until September 12, and given to Joseph K. Mansfield just two days prior to Antietam, where he was killed in action.

At Antietam, the I and XII Corps were the first Union outfits to fight and both corps suffered enormous casualties (plus the loss of their commanders) so that they were down to near-division strength and their brigades at regimental strength after the battle was over. The II and IX Corps were also heavily engaged but the V and VI Corps largely stayed out of the battle.

When Burnside took over command of the army from McClellan in the fall, he formed the army into four Grand Divisions. The Right Grand Division was commanded by Edwin Sumner and comprised the II and XI Corps, the Center Grand Division, commanded by Joe Hooker, comprised the V and III Corps, and the Left Grand Division, commanded by William Franklin, comprised the VI and I Corps. In addition, the Reserve Grand Division, commanded by Franz Sigel, comprised the XI and XII Corps.

At Fredericksburg, the I Corps was commanded by John F. Reynolds, the II Corps by Darius Couch, the III Corps by George Stoneman, the V Corps by Daniel Butterfield, the VI Corps by William F. Smith, and the IX Corps by Orlando Willcox. The XI Corps was commanded by Franz Sigel and the XII Corps by Henry Slocum, however, neither corps was present at Fredericksburg, the former not arriving until after the battle was over, and the latter was stationed at Harper&#x27;s Ferry.

Following Fredericksburg, Burnside was removed from command of the army and replaced by Joe Hooker. Hooker immediately abolished the Grand Divisions and also for the first time organized the cavalry into a proper corps led by George Stoneman instead of having them ineffectually scattered among infantry divisions. Burnside and his old IX Corps departed out to a command in the Western Theater. The I, II, and XII Corps retained the same commanders they had had during the Fredericksburg campaign, but the other corps got new commanders once again. Daniel Butterfield was chosen by Hooker as his new chief of staff and command of the V Corps went to George Meade. Daniel Sickles received command of the III Corps and Oliver Howard the XI Corps after Franz Sigel had resigned, refusing to serve under Hooker, his junior in rank. William Franklin also left the army for the same reason. Edwin Sumner, who was in his 60s and exhausted from campaigning, departed as well and died a few months later. William F. Smith resigned from command of the VI Corps, which was taken over by John Sedgwick. The I and V Corps were not significantly engaged during the Chancellorsville campaign.

During the Gettysburg Campaign, the army&#x27;s existing organization was largely retained, but a number of brigades composed of short-term nine-month regiments departed as their enlistment terms expired. Darius Couch resigned from command of the II Corps after Chancellorsville, the corps going to Winfield Hancock. The Pennsylvania Reserves Division, having spent several months in Washington D.C. resting and refitting from the 1862 campaigns, returned to the army, but was added to the V Corps rather than rejoining the I Corps. George Stoneman had been removed from command of the cavalry corps by Hooker after a poor performance during the Chancellorsville campaign and replaced by Alfred Pleasanton.

George Meade was suddenly appointed the commander of the army on June 28, a mere three days before the battle of Gettysburg. At the battle, the I, II, and III Corps suffered such severe losses that they were almost nonfunctional as fighting units at the end. One corps commander (Reynolds) was killed, another (Sickles) lost a leg and was permanently out of the war, and a third (Hancock) was badly wounded and never completely recovered from his injuries. The VI Corps had not been significantly engaged and was mostly used to plug up holes in the line during the battle.

For the remainder of the war, corps were added and subtracted from the army. IV Corps was broken up after the Peninsula Campaign, with its headquarters and 2nd Division left behind in Yorktown, while its 1st Division moved north, attached to the VI Corps, in the Maryland Campaign. Those parts of the IV Corps that remained on the Peninsula were reassigned to the Department of Virginia and disbanded on October 1, 1863. Those added to the Army of the Potomac were IX Corps, XI Corps (Sigel&#x27;s I Corps in the former Army of Virginia), XII Corps (Banks&#x27;s II Corps from the Army of Virginia), added in 1862; and the Cavalry Corps, created in 1863.

Eight of these corps (seven infantry, one cavalry) served in the army during 1863, but due to attrition and transfers, the army was reorganized in March 1864 with only four corps: II, V, VI, and Cavalry. Of the original eight, I and III Corps were disbanded due to heavy casualties and their units combined into other corps. The XI and XII Corps were ordered to the West in late 1863 to support the Chattanooga Campaign, and while there were combined into the XX Corps, never returning to the East.

The IX Corps returned to the army in 1864, after being assigned to the West in 1863 and then served alongside, but not as part of, the Army of the Potomac from March to May 24, 1864. On that latter date, IX Corps was formally added to the Army of the Potomac. Two divisions of the Cavalry Corps have transferred in August 1864 to Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan&#x27;s Army of the Shenandoah, and the 2nd Division alone remained under Meade&#x27;s command.

On March 26, 1865, that division was also assigned to Sheridan for the closing campaigns of the war.

<text>Kusel () is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the south of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north-west clockwise) Birkenfeld, Bad Kreuznach, Donnersbergkreis, Kaiserslautern, Saarpfalz and Sankt Wendel (the last two belonging to the state of Saarland).

==History==
The district of Kusel was created at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1939 it was renamed as &quot;Landkreis Kusel&quot;. The boundary was altered slightly as part of the communal reform of 1969/72 with some parts of the district of Birkenfeld being added to Kusel.

==Geography==
The district of Kusel lies in the North Palatine Uplands (&quot;Nordpfälzer Bergland&quot;), to the north of the industrial areas of the Saarland. The largest rivers are the Lauter (also called the Waldlauter, to distinguish it from other rivers in German-speaking Europe named Lauter) and the Glan.

==Coat of arms==
The German blazon reads: &quot;Gespalten: Vorne in Schwarz ein linksgewendeter, rot bewehrter goldener Löwe, hinten in Silber ein rot bewehrter, blauer Löwe.&quot;

The district&#x27;s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pale sable a lion rampant sinister Or armed and langued gules and argent a lion rampant azure armed and langued of the third.

The two charges, both lions, are both heraldic devices borne by former lords, the one on the dexter (armsbearer&#x27;s right, viewer&#x27;s left) side by the Counts of Veldenz and the one on the sinister (armsbearer&#x27;s left, viewer&#x27;s right) side by Electoral Palatinate, which acquired the area in the 15th century. The arms were approved on 13 December 1965.

<text>Ramón Luis Rivera Rivera (born June 21, 1929) is a Puerto Rican politician affiliated with the New Progressive Party. He served as Mayor of Bayamón from 1977 until 2001.

==Early life==
Rivera was born in Aguas Buenas. Rivera began his primary studies in his hometown of Aguas Buenas, but completed high school at the Dr. Agustín Stahl High School in Bayamón. He then completed an Associate degree in Administration from the Metropolitan School of Commerce. Rivera served in the United States Army. From 1952 to 1954, he served during the Korean War. He was stationed in Germany until being honorably discharged. Rivera worked for 15 years for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith.

==Political career==
Rivera began his political career in 1968, when he was elected as member of the Municipal Assembly of Bayamón. In 1972, Rivera was elected to the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico representing District 6.

After one term as Representative, Rivera ran for Mayor at the 1976 general election. He defeated incumbent Manuel Aponte Borrero. His main concerns towards Bayamón were in the tourism and business industries. During his 24-year tenure, many buildings and other types of structures were inaugurated, including the &quot;Parque De Las Ciencias&quot;, the &quot;Parque del Trensito&quot; (which had, at the time it opened, Puerto Rico&#x27;s only running train and a DC-3 plane formerly used by United Airlines), the city hall, which is a building that crosses over an avenue, the Ruben Rodriguez Coliseum, the Canton Mall, a small, pedestrian suspension bridge at Lomas Verdes neighborhood and many others. In addition, a large industrial park with such notable companies as 7 Up and Wrangler also opened, in the area known as &quot;Lomas Verdes&quot;. 7UP has a bottling facility there.

Rivera was a member of the New Progressive Party (PNP). Rivera was the president of the New Progressive Party from 1988 until 1989. In 2000, he announced he would not run for mayor again, and his son, Ramón Luis Rivera Jr. was then elected as mayor. Rivera Jr. has held that position ever since. Rivera Sr. has since retired from public life.

He was born in York. His father, also named John (1726–1803), was well known as a moulder and seller of plaster casts at the sign of the Golden Head, New Street, Covent Garden, London. His first wife&#x27;s maiden name was Lee, and they had two sons, William and John. 

Within six months of John&#x27;s birth, the family returned to London. He was a sickly child, high-shouldered, with a head too large for his body. His mother died when he was nine, and his father married Elisabeth Gordon in 1763. John had little schooling and was largely self-educated. He took delight in drawing and modelling from his father&#x27;s stock-in-trade, and studied translations from classical literature in an effort to understand them.
His father&#x27;s customers helped him with books, advice, and later with commissions. Particularly significant were the painter George Romney, and a cultivated clergyman, Anthony Stephen Mathew and his wife Mrs. Mathew, in whose house in Rathbone Place the young Flaxman used to meet the best &quot;blue-stocking&quot; society of the day and, among those his own age, the artists William Blake and Thomas Stothard, who became his closest friends. At the age of 12 he won the first prize of the Society of Arts for a medallion, and exhibited in the gallery of the Free Society of Artists; at 15 he won a second prize from the Society of Arts and showed at the Royal Academy for the first time. In the same year, 1770, he entered the academy as a student and won the silver medal. In the competition for the gold medal of the academy in 1772, however, Flaxman was defeated, the prize being awarded by the president, Sir Joshua Reynolds, to a competitor named Engleheart. This episode seemed to help cure Flaxman of a tendency to conceit which led Thomas Wedgwood V to say of him in 1775, &quot;It is but a few years since he was a most supreme coxcomb.&quot;

He continued to work diligently, both as a student and as an exhibitor at the academy, with occasional attempts at painting. To the academy he contributed a wax model of Neptune (1770); four portrait models in wax (1771); a terracotta bust, a wax figure of a child, a historical figure (1772); a figure of &quot;Comedy&quot;; and a relief of a Vestal (1773). During this period he received a commission from a friend of the Mathew family for a statue of Alexander the Great, but he was unable to obtain a regular income from private contracts.

==Wedgwood==
From 1775 he was employed by the potter Josiah Wedgwood and his partner Bentley, for whom his father had also done some work, modelling reliefs for use on the company&#x27;s jasperware and basaltware. The usual procedure was to model the reliefs in wax on slate or glass grounds before they cast for production. D&#x27;Hancarville&#x27;s engravings of Sir William Hamilton&#x27;s collection of ancient Greek vases were an important influence on his work.

His designs included the &quot;Apotheosis of Homer&quot; (1778), later used for a vase; &quot;Hercules in the Garden of Hesperides&quot; (1785); a large range of small bas-reliefs of which &quot;The Dancing Hours&quot; (1776–8) proved especially popular; library busts, portrait medallions, and a chess set.

==Early sculptural work==

By 1780 Flaxman had also begun to earn money by sculpting grave monuments. His early memorials included those to Thomas Chatterton in the church of St Mary Redcliffe in Bristol (1780), Mrs Morley in Gloucester Cathedral (1784), and the Rev. Thomas and Mrs Margaret Ball in Chichester Cathedral (1785). During the rest of Flaxman&#x27;s career memorial bas-reliefs of this type made up the bulk of his output, and are to be found in many churches throughout England. One example, the monument to George Steevens, originally in St Matthias Old Church, is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. His best monumental work was admired for its pathos and simplicity, and for the combination of a truly Greek instinct for rhythmical design and composition with a spirit of domestic tenderness and innocence.

== Marriage ==

In 1782, aged 27, Flaxman married Anne (&quot;Nancy&quot;) Denman, who was to assist him throughout his career. She was well-educated, and a devoted companion. They set up house in Wardour Street, and usually spent their summer holidays as guests of the poet William Hayley, at Eartham in Sussex. Flaxman took a shine to the Denman family, particularly Nancy&#x27;s younger sister Maria, whom he trained as a sculptor, and to whom he left a great deal in his will. He also employed Nancy&#x27;s brother Thomas Denman in his studio and it was Denman who completed the various unfinished sculptures in Flaxman&#x27;s studio after his death. Flaxman&#x27;s portrait of Maria is held in the Soane Museum.

==Italy==
In 1787, five years after their marriage, Flaxman and his wife set off for Rome, on a journey partly funded by Wedgwood. His activities in the city included supervising a group of modellers employed by Wedgwood, although he no longer made any work for the potter himself. His sketchbooks show that while there he studied not only Classical, but also Medieval and Renaissance art.

While in Rome he produced the first of the book illustrations for which he was to become famous, and which promoted his influence all over Europe, leading Goethe to describe him as &quot;the idol of all dilettanti&quot;. His designs for the works of Homer (published in 1793) were commissioned by Georgiana Hare-Naylor; those for Dante (first published in London in 1807) by Thomas Hope; those for Aeschylus by Lady Spencer. All were engraved by Piroli. Flaxman created one hundred and eleven illustrations to Dante&#x27;s Divine Comedy which served as an inspiration for such artists as Goya and Ingres, and were used as an academic source for 19th-century art students.

He had originally intended to stay in Italy for little more than two years, but was detained by a commission for a marble group of the &quot;Fury of Athamas&quot; for Frederick Hervey, Earl of Bristol and Bishop of Derry, which proved troublesome. By the time of his return to England in the summer of 1794, after an absence of seven years, he had also executed &quot;Cephalus and Aurora&quot;, a group in marble based on a story in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. This was bought by Thomas Hope, who arrived in Rome in 1791, and is often said to have commissioned it. Hope was later to make it the centrepiece of a &quot;Flaxman room&quot; at his London home. It is now in the collection of the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Liverpool.

==Return to England==
During their homeward journey, the Flaxmans travelled through central and northern Italy. On their return they took a house in Buckingham Street, Fitzroy Square, which they never left. Buckingham Street has since been renamed Greenwell Street, W1; there is a plaque to Flaxman on the front wall of no.7 identifying this as the site of the house where Flaxman lived. Immediately after his return the sculptor published a protest against the scheme (already considered by the French Directory and carried out two years later by Napoleon) to set up a vast central museum of art at Paris to contain works looted from across Europe. Despite this, he later took take advantage of the Peace of Amiens to go to Paris to see the despoiled treasures collected there.

While still in Rome, Flaxman had sent home models for several sepulchral monuments, including one in relief for the poet William Collins in Chichester cathedral, and one in the round for Lord Mansfield in Westminster Abbey.


In 1797 he was made an associate of the Royal Academy. He exhibited work at the academy annually, occasionally showing a public monument in the round, like those of Pasquale Paoli (1798) or Captain Montague (1802) for Westminster Abbey, of Sir William Jones for University College, Oxford (1797–1801), of Nelson or Howe for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, but more often memorials for churches, with symbolic Acts of Mercy or illustrations of biblical texts, usually in low relief. He made a large number of these smaller funerary monuments; his work was in great demand, and he did not charge particularly high prices. Occasionally he would vary his output with a classical piece like those he favoured in his earlier years. Soon after his election as Associate of the academy, he published a scheme for a grandiose monument to be erected on Greenwich Hill, in the form of a figure of Britannia high, in honour of British naval victories.

==Later life==
In 1800 he was elected a full Academician, and in 1810 the academy appointed him to the specially created post of Professor of Sculpture. He was a thorough and judicious teacher, and his lectures were often reprinted. According to Sidney Colvin writing in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition: &quot;With many excellent observations, and with one singular merit—that of doing justice, as in those days justice was hardly ever done, to the sculpture of the medieval schools—these lectures lack point and felicity of expression, just as they are reported to have lacked fire in delivery, and are somewhat heavy reading.&quot; His most important sculptural works from the years following this appointment were the monument to Mrs Baring in Micheldever church, the richest of all his monuments in relief (1805–1811); that for the Cooke-Yarborough family at Campsall church, Yorkshire, those to Sir Joshua Reynolds for St Paul&#x27;s (1807); to Captain Webbe for India (1810); to Captains Walker and Beckett for Leeds (1811); to Lord Cornwallis for Prince of Wales&#x27;s Island (1812); and to Sir John Moore for Glasgow (1813).

He was commissioned to create the monument to Matthew Boulton (died 1809), by Boulton&#x27;s son, which is on the north wall of the sanctuary of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Handsworth, Birmingham, where Boulton is buried. It includes a marble bust of Boulton, set in a circular opening above two putti, one holding an engraving of the Soho Manufactory.

Around this time there was much debate over the merits of the sculptures from the Parthenon in Athens, which had been brought to Britain by Lord Elgin, and were hence popularly known as the Elgin marbles. When Flaxman first saw them at Elgin&#x27;s house in 1807, he advised against their restoration. Flaxman&#x27;s statements in favour of their purchase by the government to a parliamentary commission carried considerable weight; the sculptures were eventually bought in 1816. His designs for the friezes of &quot;Ancient Drama&quot; and &quot;Modern Drama&quot;, for the facade of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, made in 1809 and carved by John Charles Felix Rossi, provide an early example of the direct influence of the marbles on British sculpture.

In the years immediately following his Roman period he produced fewer outline designs for publication, except three for William Cowper&#x27;s translations of the Latin poems of John Milton (1810). In 1817, however, he returned to the genre, publishing a set of designs to Hesiod, which were engraved by Blake. He also designed work for goldsmiths at around this time—a testimonial cup in honour of John Kemble, and the famous and beautiful (though quite un-Homeric) &quot;Shield of Achilles&quot; designed between 1810 and 1817 for Rundell, Bridge and Rundell. Other late works included a frieze of &quot;Peace, Liberty and Plenty&quot;, for the Duke of Bedford&#x27;s sculpture gallery at Woburn Abbey, and a heroic group of St Michael overthrowing Satan, for Lord Egremont&#x27;s Petworth House, delivered after Flaxman&#x27;s death. He also wrote several articles on art and archaeology for Rees&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopædia&quot; (1819–20).

In the last six years of his life, Flaxman designed decorations for the facades of Buckingham Palace. Some of his drawings for this commission are now held by the Royal Collection Trust.

In 1820 Flaxman&#x27;s wife died. Her younger sister, Maria Denman, and his half sister, Mary Ann Flaxman, continued to live with him, and he continued to work hard. In 1822 he delivered at the academy a lecture in memory of his old friend, Canova, who had recently died; in 1823 he received a visit from Schlegel, who wrote an account of their meeting.

Flaxman died, aged 71, on 7 December 1826. His name is listed as one of the important lost graves on the Burdett Coutts Memorial in Old St. Pancras Churchyard. He was buried at St. Giles&#x27; Cemetery, King&#x27;s Road (St Giles in the Fields), beside his wife Anne and his sister Mary Ann Flaxman.

&quot;Flaxman Terrace&quot; in Bloomsbury, London, is named after him. The Chelsea telephone exchange that became 020 7352 was also named after him, the digits 352 still corresponding to the old three-letter dialling code FLA.

==Studio practice==
Most of the carving of his works was carried out by assistants; Margaret Whinney thought that, as a result, &quot;the execution of some of his marbles is a little dull&quot; but that &quot;his plaster models, cast from his own designs in clay, frequently show more sensitive handling&quot;. Early in his career, Flaxman made his works in the form of small models which his assistants would scale up when making the finished marble versions. In many cases, notably with the monument to Lord Howe, this proved problematic, and for his later works, he produced full-sized plaster versions for his employees to work from.

==Critical reception==
Flaxman&#x27;s complicated monuments in the round, such as the three in Westminster Abbey and the four in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, are considered too &quot;heavy&quot;; but his simple monuments in relief are of finer quality. He thoroughly understood relief, and it gave better scope for his particular talents. His compositions are best studied in the casts from his studio sketches, of which a comprehensive collection is preserved in the Flaxman gallery at University College, London. 

== Collections of Flaxman&#x27;s work ==
The principal public collections of Flaxman&#x27;s work are at University College London, in the British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. University College London also holds archival material belonging to Flaxman and a collection of books illustrated by him.

<text>Filippo Antonio Pasquale de&#x27; Paoli (; or ; ; 6 April 1725 – 5 February 1807) was a Corsican patriot, statesman, and military leader who was at the forefront of resistance movements against the Genoese and later French rule over the island. He became the President of the Executive Council of the General Diet of the People of Corsica and wrote the Constitution of the state.

The Corsican Republic (1755–1769) was a representative democracy asserting that the elected Diet of Corsican representatives had no master. Paoli held his office by election and not by appointment. It made him commander-in-chief of the armed forces as well as chief magistrate. Paoli&#x27;s government claimed the same jurisdiction as the Republic of Genoa. In terms of &quot;de facto&quot; exercise of power, the Genoese held the coastal cities, which they could defend from their citadels, but the Corsican republic controlled the rest of the island from Corte, its capital.

Following the French conquest of Corsica in 1768, Paoli oversaw the Corsican resistance. Following the defeat of Corsican forces at the Battle of Ponte Novu he was forced into exile in Britain where he was a celebrated figure. He returned after the French Revolution, of which he was initially supportive. He later broke with the revolutionaries and helped to create the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom which lasted between 1794 and 1796. After the island was re-occupied by France he again went into exile in Britain where he died in 1807.

Paoli was idolized by a young Napoleon Bonaparte, who was a Corsican nationalist at the time. The Bonapartes had assisted him during the French invasion but refused to go into exile with him and pledged allegiance to King Louis XV. Paoli saw the Bonapartes as collaborators, and upon regaining power during the French Revolution he tried to prevent Napoleon from returning to his position in the Corsican National Guard. In May 1793, Paolists detained Napoleon on his way to his post (though he was soon released), ransacked his home, and formally outlawed the Bonapartes via the Corsican parliament. These events and others in 1793 accelerated Napoleon&#x27;s transition from Corsican to French nationalism. Napoleon never fully outgrew his fondness of Paoli, and had mixed feelings about him throughout the rest of his life.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Paoli was born in the hamlet of Stretta, Morosaglia commune, part of the ancient parish of Rostino, Haute-Corse, Corsica. He was the second son of the physician and patriot Giacinto Paoli, who was to become one of three &quot;Generals of the People&quot; in the Corsican nationalist movement that rebelled against rule by the Republic of Genoa, which at that time they regarded as corrupt and tyrannical. Prior to that century Corsicans more or less accepted Genoan rule. By 1729, the year of first rebellion, the Genovese were regarded as failing in their task of government. The major problems were the high murder rate because of the custom of vendetta, the raiding of coastal villages by the Barbary pirates, oppressive taxes and economic depression.

In the rebellion of 1729 over a new tax, the Genovese withdrew into their citadels and sent for foreign interventions: first from the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire, and then from their enemies in the War of Austrian Succession, Bourbon France. Defeated by professional troops, the Corsicans ceded violence, but kept their organisation. After surrendering to the French in 1739, Giacinto Paoli went into exile in Naples with his then 14-year-old son, Pasquale. An older brother, Clemente, remained at home as a liaison to the revolutionary diet, or assembly of the people.

Corsica was subsequently distracted by the aforementioned War of the Austrian Succession, during which troops of a number of countries temporarily occupied the cities of Corsica. In Naples, Giacinto perceiving that he had a talented son, spared no effort or expense in his education, which was primarily classical. The enlightenment of which Pasquale was to become a part was neo-classical in its art, architecture and sentiments. Paoli is said once to have heard an old man on the road reciting Virgil, walked up behind him, clapped him on the back, and resumed reciting at the point where the other had left off.
In 1741, Pasquale joined the Corsican regiment of the royal Neapolitan army and served in Calabria under his father.

Corsican exiles in Italy were seeking assistance for the revolution, including a skilled general. In 1736 the exiles of Genoa had discovered Theodor von Neuhoff, a soldier of fortune whom they were willing to make king, but he was unsuccessful, and in 1754, languished in a debtors&#x27; prison in London. The young Pasquale became of interest when in opposition to a plan to ask the Knights of Malta to assume command, he devised a plan for a native Corsican government. In that year, Giacinto decided that Pasquale was ready to supplant Theodor, and wrote to Vincente recommending that a general election be held. The subsequent popular election called by Vincente at Caccia made Pasquale General-in-Chief of Corsica, commander of all resistance.

Corsica at that time was still under the influence of feuding clans, as a result of which only the highland clans had voted in the election. The lowlanders now held an election of their own and elected Mario Matra as commander, who promptly attacked the supporters of Paoli. Moreover, Matra called on the Genovese for assistance, dragging Paoli into a conflict with them. Matra was killed shortly in battle and his support among the Corsicans collapsed.

Paoli&#x27;s next task was to confine the Genovese to their citadels. His second was to frame a constitution, which when ratified by the population in 1755, set up a new republic, a representative democracy. Its first election made Paoli president, supplanting his former position.
===President of the Corsican Republic===


In November 1755, the people of Corsica ratified a constitution that proclaimed Corsica a sovereign nation, independent from the Republic of Genoa. This was the first constitution written under Enlightenment principles. The new head of state, called the General, Paoli, was elected over rival candidate Emmanuele Matra by representatives of the pievi (68 ancient administrative units, each grouping several parishes), although only 16 of the 68 were represented. The president and author of the constitution occupied himself with building a modern state. For example, he founded a university at Corte. Linda Colley credits Paoli as writing the first ever written constitution of a nation state.

===French invasion===

Seeing that they had in effect lost control of Corsica, Genoa responded by ceding Corsica to the French by the treaty of Versailles in May 1768, as this was the only way to repay France for the debts incurred for the defence of the island. In September 1768, France proceeded to the conquest of the island. Paoli fought a guerilla war from the mountains but in 1769 he was defeated in the Battle of Ponte Novu by vastly superior forces and took refuge in England. Corsica officially became a French province in 1789.

===First exile===

In London, Paoli attracted the attention of the Johnsonian circle almost immediately for which his expansive personality made him a natural fit. By the time Paoli entered the scene it had in part taken the form of The Club of mainly successful men of a liberal frame of mind. Such behaviour as Paoli showing his bullet-ridden coat to all visitors and then demanding a gratuity for the observation were amusing to the group, which had begun when its members were starting their careers and according to its chronicler James Boswell were themselves needy.

Paoli&#x27;s memoirs were recorded by Boswell in his book, &quot;An Account of Corsica&quot;.

After a series of interviews with King George III, Paoli was given a pension by the Crown with the understanding that if he ever returned to Corsica in a position of authority, he would support British interests against the French. This was not, however, a cynical arrangement. Paoli became sincerely pro-British and had a genuine affection for his new friends, including the King, a predisposition that in the French Revolution led him into the royalist camp. The arrangement also was not a treaty of any sort, as at the time neither Paoli nor King George III would have any idea of future circumstances.

===President of the department of Corsica===

By the time of the French Revolution the name of Paoli had become something of an idol of liberty and democracy. In 1790 the revolutionary National Assembly in Paris passed a decree incorporating Corsica into France, essentially duplicating the work of 1780 but under a new authority. It granted amnesty to exiles, on which Paoli embarked immediately for Corsica. He arrived in time for the election of departmental officers at Orezza, ran for president, and was elected unanimously. Napoleon Bonaparte, organiser of the elections and active Jacobin, did not run at this time, but he was as much an admirer of Paoli as anyone.

Napoleon, on leave from his artillery regiment, returned to the regiment at Auxonne, where he was working on a history of Corsica. Writing to Paoli, he asked his opinion on some of it and for historical documents. The differences between the two men became apparent. Paoli thought the history amateurish and too impassioned and refused the documents; Napoleon at this point had no idea of Paoli&#x27;s regal connections in Britain or moderate, even sympathetic, sentiments about royalty.

===President of the British protectorate===

Paoli split from the French Revolution over the issue of the execution of the King and threw in his lot with the royalist party. He did not make these views generally known, but when the revolutionary government ordered him to take Sardinia he put his nephew in charge of the expedition with secret orders to lose the conflict. In that case he was acting as a British agent, as the British had an interest in Sardinia they could not pursue if the French occupied it.

He had however also sent Napoleon Bonaparte as a colonel in command of two companies of Corsican guard (unofficially reinforced by 6000 revolutionaries from Marseille), which participated in the assault on La Maddalena Island in February 1793. It failed because the commander, Pietro Paolo Colonna-Cesari, failed to take appropriate military action, because the island had been reinforced just prior to the attack, and because the defenders seemed to know exactly where and when the revolutionaries were going to strike.

Napoleon perceived the situation during the first confrontation with his commander and assumed de facto command, but the attack failed and he barely escaped. Enraged, after having been a strong supporter and admirer of Paoli, he and the entire Bonaparte family denounced Paoli as a traitor before the French National Convention. Arrest warrants were issued and sent to Corsica along with a force intended to take the citadels from the royalists, who had supplanted the Genovese after the sale of Corsica. Combining the Paolists and royalists defeated the Bonapartes and drove them from the island.

Paoli then summoned a &quot;consulta&quot; (assembly) at Corte in 1793, with himself as president and formally seceded from France. He requested the protection of the British government, then at war with revolutionary France. In 1794, the British sent a fleet under Admiral Samuel Hood. This fleet had just been ejected from the French port of Toulon by a revolutionary army following the plan of Napoleon Bonaparte, for which he was promoted to Brigadier General. The royalists at Toulon also had requested British protection. Napoleon was now dispatched to deal with Italy as commander of the French forces there.

For a short time, Corsica was a protectorate of King George III, chiefly by the exertions of Hood&#x27;s fleet (e.g. in the Siege of Calvi), and Paoli&#x27;s co-operation. This period has become known as the &quot;Anglo-Corsican Kingdom&quot; because George III was accepted as sovereign head of state, but this was not an incorporation of Corsica into the British Empire. The relationship between Paoli&#x27;s government and the British was never clearly defined, resulting in numerous questions of authority. At last, the Crown invited Paoli to resign and return to exile in Britain with a pension, which, having no other options now, he did. Not long after, the French reconquered the island and all questions of Corsican sovereignty came to an end until the 20th century.

===Second exile and death===

Paoli set sail for England in October 1795, where he lived out his final years. Pasquale Paoli died on 5 February 1807, and was buried in Old St. Pancras Churchyard in London. His name is listed on the 1879 Burdett-Coutts Memorial Sundial amongst the important graves lost.

A bust was placed in Westminster Abbey. In 1889, his bones were brought to Corsica in a British frigate and interred at the family home under a memorial in the Italian language.

== Personal life ==

Pasquale never married and as far as is known had no heirs. Information about his intimate life is mainly lacking. It was rumoured that he had an affair with Maria Cosway but this is unsubstantiated. Robert Harvey claims he was a homosexual, when discussing how Carlo Buonaparte became Paoli&#x27;s personal secretary.

==Paoli and Italian irredentism==

Insofar as Italian irredentism was a political or historical movement, Pasquale Paoli lived long before its time and did not have anything to do with the movement that ended with the occupation of Corsica by Italian fascist troops in late 1942, during World War II.

There is no question, however, that Paoli was sympathetic to Italian culture and regarded his own native language as an Italian dialect (Corsican is an Italic language closely related to Tuscan, Sicilian and, to some extent, Sardinian language). He was considered by Niccolò Tommaseo, who collected his &quot;Lettere&quot; (Letters), as one of the precursors of the Italian irredentism. The &quot;Babbu di a Patria&quot; (Father of the fatherland), as Pasquale Paoli was nicknamed by the Corsicans, wrote in his Letters the following appeal in 1768 against the French invaders:

We are Corsicans by birth and sentiment, but first of all we feel Italian by language, origins, customs, traditions; and Italians are all brothers and united in the face of history and in the face of God ... As Corsicans we wish to be neither slaves nor &quot;rebels&quot; and as Italians we have the right to deal as equals with the other Italian brothers ... Either we shall be free or we shall be nothing... Either we shall win or we shall die (against the French), weapons in hand ... The war against France is right and holy as the name of God is holy and right, and here on our mountains will appear for Italy the sun of liberty...
(&quot;Siamo còrsi per nascita e sentimento ma prima di tutto ci sentiamo italiani per lingua, origini, costumi, tradizioni e gli italiani sono tutti fratelli e solidali di fronte alla storia e di fronte a Dio… Come còrsi non-vogliamo essere né schiavi né &quot;ribelli&quot; e come italiani abbiamo il diritto di trattare da pari con gli altri fratelli d&#x27;Italia… O saremo liberi o non saremo niente… O vinceremo con l&#x27;onore o soccomberemo (contro i francesi) con le armi in mano... La guerra con la Francia è giusta e santa come santo e giusto è il nome di Dio, e qui sui nostri monti spunterà per l&#x27;Italia il sole della libertà…&quot;)

Paoli wanted Italian to be the official language of his Corsican Republic. His Corsican Constitution of 1755 was written in Italian and the short-lived university he founded in the city of Corte in 1765 used Italian as teaching language.

==Paoli commemorated in the United States==

The American Sons of Liberty movement were inspired by Paoli. Ebenezer McIntosh, a leader of the Sons of Liberty, named his son Paschal Paoli McIntosh in honour of him. In 1768, the editor of the &quot;New York Journal&quot; described Paoli as &quot;the greatest man on earth&quot;. Several places in the United States are named after him. These include:
* Paoli, Colorado
* Paoli, Indiana
* Paoli, Kentucky
* Paoli, Oklahoma
* Paoli, Pennsylvania, which was named after &quot;General Paoli&#x27;s Tavern&quot; a meeting-point of the Sons of Liberty and homage to the &quot;General of the Corsicans&quot;.
* Paoli, Wisconsin

<text>Frederick Wedmore (9 July 1844 – 25 February 1921) was a British art critic and man of letters.

Wedmore was born at Richmond Hill, Clifton, the eldest son of Thomas Wedmore of Druids Stoke, Stoke Bishop. His family were Quakers, and he was educated at a Quaker private school and then in Lausanne and Paris. After a short experience of journalism in Bristol he came to London in 1868, and began to write for The Spectator. His early works included two novels, but the best examples of his prose are perhaps to be found in his volumes of short stories, &quot;Pastorals of France&quot; (1877), &quot;Renunciations&quot; (1893), &quot;Orgeas and Miradou&quot; (1896), reprinted in 1905 as &quot;A Dream of Provence&quot;.

In 1900 he published another novel, &quot;The Collapse of the Penitent&quot;. As early as 1878 he had begun a long connection with the &quot;London Standard&quot; as art critic. He began his studies on etching with a noteworthy paper in &quot;The Nineteenth Century&quot; (1877–1878) on the etchings of Charles Meryon. This was followed by &quot;The Four Masters of Etching&quot; (1883), with original etchings by Sir FS Haden, , JM Whistler, and Alphonse Legros; &quot;Etching in England&quot; (1895); an English edition (1894) of E Michel&#x27;s &quot;Rembrandt: His Life, His Works, and His Time In Two Volumes&quot;; and a study and a catalogue of &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Etchings&quot; (1886, 2nd edition 1899). His other works include &quot;Studies in English Art&quot; (2 vols., 1876–80), &quot;The Masters of Genre Painting&quot; (1880), &quot;On Books and Arts&quot; (1899), &quot;English Water Colour&quot; (1902), &quot;Turner and Ruskin&quot; (2 vols., 1900).

He was knighted in 1912. He published that year his &quot;Memories&quot;, a book of reminiscences, social and literary. He also published &quot;Painters and Painting&quot; (1913) and a novel, &quot;Brenda Walks On&quot; (1916). He died at Sevenoaks.

==Family==
His daughter, Millicent Wedmore (born 1879), herself the author of two volumes of verse, helped him to edit during World War I &quot;Poems of the Love and Pride of England&quot;.

<doc id="222609" wikidata="Q946578" url="?curid=222609" title="Francis Seymour Haden">
<text>Sir Francis Seymour Haden PPRE (16 September 1818 – 1 June 1910), was an English surgeon, better known as an original etcher who championed original printmaking. He was at the heart of the Etching Revival in Britain, and one of the founders of the Society of Painter-Etchers, now the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers, as its first president. He was also a collector and scholar of Rembrandt&#x27;s prints.

==Life==
Haden was born at 62 Lower Sloane Street, Chelsea, London. His father, Charles Thomas Haden, being a well-known doctor and lover of music. He was educated at Derby School, Christ&#x27;s Hospital, and University College, London, and also studied at the Sorbonne, Paris, where he took his degree in 1840. He was admitted as a member of the College of Surgeons in London in 1842.

==Artistic career==

In 1843–44, with his friends Duval, Le Cannes and Colonel Guibout, he travelled to Italy and made his first sketches and six etchings from nature. Haden attended no art school and had no art teachers, but between 1845 and 1848 he studied intently, the portfolios of prints belonging to a second-hand dealer named Love, who had a shop in Bunhill Row, the old Quaker quarter of London. Arranging the prints in chronological order, he studied in particular, the works of the great original engravers, Albrecht Dürer, Lucas van Leyden and Rembrandt.

As mentioned in &quot;Print REbels&quot; primarily celebrating the bicentenary of Haden: Exquisite line, especially drypoint burr, sometimes calligraphic in sensibility, can be seen across Haden&#x27;s prints, the majority which are landscapes. Added to this is his range and intensity of expression. He expresses the maximum by means of the minimum to achieve the essence of his subject matter: what Haden himself called &quot;the labour of omission&quot;. Haden&#x27;s printmaking was mutually invigorated by his younger brother-in-law, James McNeill Whistler, at the Haden home in Lower Sloane Street in 1855. An etching press was installed there and for a while Haden and Whistler collaborated on a series of etchings of the Thames. However, the relationship and project did not last.
Haden followed the art of original etching with such vigour that he became not only the foremost British exponent of that art from 1865 but brought about its revival in England. His strenuous efforts and perseverance, aided by the secretarial ability of Sir William R Drake RE, resulted in the foundation of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, styled the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers since 1990. As President Haden ruled the Society for thirty years with a strong hand from its first beginnings in 1880. &quot;As PRE,&quot; Frederick Keppel, author and print collector wrote: &quot;Sir Francis Seymour Haden did great work in maintaining sound doctrine in etching. Nothing was admitted that was &quot;commercial&quot; in character, and etchings that were done after paintings by other hands were vigorously ruled out.&quot; In fact, as regarding the RE Members, &quot;he ruled them with a rod of iron,&quot; However, &quot;membership was eagerly sought for – so much that many famous et hers weren&#x27;t never elected though they thrived hard to be.&quot;

Notwithstanding Haden&#x27;s study of the old masters of his art, Haden&#x27;s own plates were very individual. He preferred to work directly onto the plate in front of the subject. Malcolm Salaman Hon RE wrote of Haden drawing from nature; &quot;with that breadth, freedom, and spontaneity of effect, which, while suggesting a sketch,
represented a true etcher&#x27;s drawing&quot;. Even when working from a picture by another artist his personality dominates the plate, as for example in the large plate he etched after J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s &quot;Calais Pier&quot;, which is a classical example of what interpretative work can do in black and white. Of his original plates, 263 in number, one of the most notable was the large &quot;Breaking up of the Agamemnon&quot;.[4]

An early plate, rare and most beautiful, is &quot;Thames Fisherman&quot;. &quot;Mytton Hall&quot; is broad in treatment, and a fine rendering of a shady avenue of yew trees leading to an old manor-house (now a hotel in Lancashire) in September sunlight. &quot;Sub Tegmine&quot; was etched in Greenwich Park in 1859; and &quot;Early Morning—Richmond&quot;&quot;, full of the poetry and freshness of the hour, was done, according to Haden, actually at sunrise. [4]

Also mentioned in Print REbels: ‘Haden’s finest and rarest compositions were created along the River Muteen, by Greenpark in Dundrum, County Tipperary and at Glenmalure, County Wicklow. This surgeon-etcher visited Ireland four times between 1859 and 1864. Impressions of A River in Ireland, A Bye Road in Tipperary and Sunset in Ireland are hailed internationally amongst the finest landscape etchings of the 19th century. Kenneth Guichard writes in British Etchers 1850-1950 published in London, 1977: 

‘Sunset in Ireland must be one of the greatest prints ever produced in etching, one can feel the dew beginning at the end of a balmy evening in Tipperary.” [4]

This is fortified in Raymond Lister and Robin Garton’s book, Great Images of Printmaking in 1978:

‘1863 was a sublime year for Haden in printmaking. Sunset in Ireland is one of the greatest etchings of its period. It has the potency of ‘A River in Ireland’, but its textures are still richer, with their hint of that humid dusk often encountered in Ireland. There too, a note of mystery in the river as it curves into wooded reaches. In places the lines of shading seem almost careless, where much of the composition is cross-hatched by diagonal lines. The apparent carelessness is all part of Haden’s calculated and brilliant gift of suggestion. The plate was etched on the spot at Dundrum Park in Tipperary’. [4]

Other notable plates include are &quot;Combe Bottom&quot;, &quot;Shere Mill Pond&quot; (both the small study and the larger plate), The Towing Path, Kilgaren Castle, The Three Sisters, Battersea Reach – Out of Whistler&#x27;s Window, &quot;Penton Hook&quot;, &quot;Grim Spain&quot; and &quot;Evening Fishing, Longparish&#x27;. ‘Sunset in Ireland’ is Haden&#x27;s acknowledged pastoral masterpiece. A catalogue of his works was begun by Sir William Drake and completed by Harrington in 1880. During later years also Haden began to practise mezzotint engraving, with a measure of the same success that he had already achieved in pure etching and in drypoint. His mezzotints include &quot;An Early Riser&quot;, a stag seen through the morning mists, &quot;Grayling Fishing&quot; and &quot;A Salmon Pool on the Spey&quot;. He also created paintings and charcoal drawings of trees and park-like country.

==Writings==

Haden&#x27;s studies of Rembrandt, besides influencing his original work, led to his important monograph on the Dutch artist&#x27;s etchings. Haden was the first to catalogue Rembrandt&#x27;s etchings chronologically and in &quot;states&quot;. Through books and lectures, and with the aid of an exhibition at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1877, he tried to give a true reflection of Rembrandt&#x27;s work, excluding from his &quot;oeuvre&quot; a large number of plates previously attributed to him. Haden&#x27;s reasons were founded upon the results of a study of the master&#x27;s works in chronological order, and are clearly expressed in his monograph, &quot;The Etched Work of Rembrandt critically reconsidered&quot;, privately printed in 1877, and in &quot;The Etched Work of Rembrandt: True and False&quot; (1895). 102 of Rembrandt&#x27;s etchings from Haden&#x27;s collection were exhibited alongside the RE Annual exhibition in 1890.

Other books written by Haden not already mentioned are:
*&quot;Etudes a l&#x27;eau forte&quot; (Paris, 1865) 
*&quot;Cremation: a Pamphlet&quot; (London, 1875)
*&quot;About Etching&quot; (London, 1879)
*&quot;The Relative Claims of Etching and Engraving to rank as Fine Arts and to be represented in the Royal Academy&quot; (London, 1883)
*&quot;Address to Students of Winchester School of Art&quot; (Winchester, 1888)
*&quot;The Disposal of the Dead, a Plea for Legislation&quot; (London, 1888).
*&quot;The Art of the Painter-Etcher&quot; (London, 1890)

As the last two indicate, he was an ardent champion of a system of &quot;earth to earth&quot; burial. During the London &#x27;Burial Crisis&#x27; of the late 1840s, following several epidemics, he aired a proposal to ship the bodies of London&#x27;s dead to the Thames Estuary for use in land reclamation but this met with little approval.

==Honours and legacy==
Among numerous distinctions Haden received the Grand Prix, Paris, in 1889 and 1900, and was made an honorary member of the Institut de France, Académie des Beaux-Arts and Société des Artistes Français. Haden was knighted in 1894 for his services &quot;to the advancement of original etching and engraving&quot;.

&quot;Print REbels&quot;, was an exhibition commemorating 200 years since the birth of Haden and celebrating the origins of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers, founded by Haden, was launched by the society at the Bankside Gallery, London. It toured UK museums and galleries at Cambridge, Cheltenham, Marlborough, Devon and Wales as well as Spain in 2018 and 2019. In July and August 2021 this exhibition travelled to Dublin, Republic of Ireland, at the Knight of Glin Exhibition Room, Assembly House, headquarters of the Irish Georgian Society. A 346 page catalogue/book, written by Edward Twohig RE and published by the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers in April 2018, comprehensively mirrors Haden&#x27;s achievements and influence. A limited edition &quot;REbels Portfolio&quot; by current Members of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers was created, also, in celebration. Box sets of this portfolio are in the permanent collection of the British Museum; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge and the Royal Collection.

==Family==

In 1847 he married the musician Dasha Whistler, the half-sister of the artist James McNeill Whistler (the siblings sharing the same father only); and his eldest son, Francis Seymour Haden (b. 1850), was educated at Marlborough College in Wiltshire and had a distinguished career as a member of the government in Natal Colony from 1881 to 1893, being made a C.M.G. in 1890. His daughter Anne was the mother of the mystery writer Molly Thynne.

<text>A free reed aerophone is a musical instrument that produces sound as air flows past a vibrating reed in a frame. Air pressure is typically generated by breath or with a bellows. In the Hornbostel–Sachs system, it is number 412.13 (a member of interruptive free aerophones). Free reed instruments are contrasted with non-free or enclosed reed instruments, where the timbre is fully or partially dependent on the shape of the instrument body, Hornbostel–Sachs number: 42 (flute, reed, and brass).

== Operation ==
The following illustrations depict the type of reed typical of harmonicas, pitch pipes, accordions, and reed organs as it goes through a cycle of vibration. One side of the reed frame is omitted from the images for clarity; in reality, the frame completely encloses the reed. Airflow over one side of the reed (labeled “AR”) creates a region of low pressure on that side (see the Bernoulli&#x27;s principle article for details), causing the reed to flex towards the low-pressure side. The reed frame is constructed so that the flexing of the reed obstructs the airflow, which reduces or eliminates the low-pressure region and allows the reed to flex back.

Each time the reed passes through the frame, it interrupts air flow. These rapid, periodic interruptions of the air flow create the audible vibrations perceived by the listener.

In a free-reed instrument, it is generally the physical characteristics of the reed itself, such as mass, length, cross-sectional area, and stiffness, which determine the pitch of the musical note produced. Of secondary importance to the pitch are the physical dimensions of the chamber in which the reed is fitted, and of the air flow. As an exception, the pitch of the Chinese bawu and hulusi are determined by fingering recorder-like tone holes along the instrument body.

== History ==

Various free reed instruments appear to have been invented since antiquity. The most likely precursor to free reed aerophones is the Jew&#x27;s harp, an instrument known to many cultures throughout the world, and by many names (e.g., &quot;k&#x27;uang&quot; in ancient China). In this instrument, the main sound producer is the vibrating reed tongue itself, rather than the air flow.

Among the ancient instruments, the khene of Laos, the shēng of China and the later shō version of Japan have survived to modern times.

The sheng was traditionally made with bamboo pipes, and was first mentioned in the &quot;Shi Jing&quot; (11th to 7th centuries BC) of the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). A free reed organ was invented in the Arab world in the 13th century, while the German Heinrich Traxdorf (fl. 15th century) of Nuremberg built one around 1460 AD. In Copenhagen, one of these instruments with brass pipes and free reeds in-caved into the sides of the pipes inspired the organ builder Kirsnick to fit similar reeds into portable organs. In 1780 Kirsnick moved to Saint Petersburg improved these new organ pipes to an adjustable pitch with a hook. Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein also built his speaking machine in Copenhagen and he was in contact with Kirsnick. Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein got an award for the machine in Petersburg but he never moved to Petersburg. His machine or a copy of this machine came to Paris very shortly after 1780. Georg Joseph Vogler put all his effort to get this new type of organ pipes in use in church organs so he started with changing organs in Rotterdam (1790), London (1790), Frankfurt (1791), Stockholm (1791), Paris (1796), Berlin (1800), Prague (1802), Vienna (1804), Salzburg Munich (1805), – up to 30 documented rebuilds of organs with new free reed type organ pipes. He also held lessons at universities and did all to promote this new type of reeds, not only in German-speaking regions of Europe. The actual work was done by different organ builders, and very many people were involved, so it is nearly impossible that any organ builder in Europe did not know about free reeds after 1800. In the two years from 1802 to 1804 in Vienna, he spent time with Johann Nepomuk Mälzel and Mälzel changed the type of reeds used in his Panharmonicon to free reed pipes. Vogler, Maelzel and Friedrich Kaufmann were then at the same time in Paris in 1807. From there, Mälzel went to Regensburg and Vienna, where he constructed a new Panharmonicon and the mechanischer Trompeter; after that he went on tour again to Paris, London and other places; maybe he went for the first time to Boston and New York as well, but up to now we don&#x27;t know of any notice in a newspaper about it. Friedrich Kaufmann, a clock maker, went back home to Dresden and copied Mälzel&#x27;s machines. The &quot;mechanischer Trompeter&quot; still can be seen in a museum in Munich.

=== Free reed aerophones in the United States ===

In the United States, organ builder William M. Goodrich is often claimed to have invented the free reed. He tells that he worked in 1810 to 1812 with Johann Nepomuk Mälzel&#x27;s &quot;Pan Harmonicon&quot; that was sent to Boston and then exhibited in several towns. Mälzel had a very good relationship to Vogler while in Europe so his Pan Harmonicon used free reeds. It is not known with certainty whether Mälzel was personally in America around 1811. What is clear is that he arrived New York on February 7, 1826, which might have been either his first or his second visit to the New World. He also visited Boston around that time.
 1823 Pan Harmonicun copied;

There is a story that in 1821 James H. Bazin repaired a free reed pipe and used this type of reeds for constructing, in 1836, the &quot;lap organ&quot;.

From 1833, Prescott built similar instruments.
==== Melodeons in 1840 ====

By 1840, there were 40 melodeon builders in America.
=== Europe ===
Cyrill Demian&#x27;s &quot;(see below)&quot; patent of 1829 however states that the reeds in his instrument &quot;were known for more than 200 years as Regale, Zungen, Schnarrwerk, in organs.&quot; He compares the reeds used by him with beating reeds.

=== The accordion in Russia ===
The earliest history of the accordion in Russia is poorly documented. Nevertheless, according to Russian researchers, the earliest known simple accordions were made in Tula, Russia by from 1820, and from 1830. By the late 1840s, the instrument was already very widespread; together the factories of the two masters were producing 10,000 instruments a year. By 1866, over 50,000 instruments were being produced yearly by Tula and neighbouring villages, and by 1874 the yearly production rate was over 700,000. By the 1860s, Novgorod, Vyatka and Saratov Governorates also had significant accordion production. By the 1880s, the list included Oryol, Ryazan, Moscow, Tver, Vologda, Kostroma, Nizhny Novgorod, Simbirsk and others, and many of these places created their own varieties of the instrument. The first chromatic piano-like accordions in Russia were built in 1871 by Nikolay Ivanovich Beloborodov.

In 1907, St. Petersburg master accordion maker V. S. Sterlingov created a chromatic button accordion for the player Ya. F. Orlandskiy-Titarenko featuring 52 melody keys and 72 chords of the Stradella bass system. Orlandskiy-Titarenko called his new instrument the bayan (after the legendary bard Boyan), and it was the ancestor of the modern instrument with that name. However, its layout on the melody side was different from the layout of the modern bayan. The modern bayan&#x27;s B-system layout (or &quot;Moscow system&quot;) became more popular than the early instrument&#x27;s &quot;Leningrad system&quot; (which was more similar to the Khromka garmon) around 1930–35.

Between 1953 and 1968, the yearly production of button accordions (garmons and bayans) in the Soviet Union ranged between 597,307 and 921,674 instruments, while the yearly production of piano accordions ranged between 7,124 and 120,313 instruments (averaging around 50,000).

=== Examples ===
* Querhammerflügel with Aeoline, circa 1810, made by Johann Kasper Schlimbach at Königshofen Bayern, using steel reeds and frames made in one part.
* The accordion, patented in 1829 by Armenian-Austrian inventor Cyrill Demian.
* The concertina, patented in two forms (perhaps independently) by:
** Sir Charles Wheatstone, in 1829 and 1844;
** Carl Friedrich Uhlig, 1834.
*The harmoneon, patented in 1952 by Pierre Monichon, a French musicologist and accordionist.

Additionally, there are other free-reed instruments, such as the well-known and versatile harmonica (one of the smallest free reeds). The harmonium, or pump-organ, has numerous forms, including the orthotonophonium and the peti or samvadini (the Indian floor harmonium, used often as accompaniment in Indian classical music performances). The martinshorn hails from Germany, while the melodica has seen many applications across numerous styles of music, including reggae and Caribbean music.

The bandoneon (Spanish: &quot;bandoneón&quot;), a slightly larger concertina, was named by German inventor Heinrich Band; by the late 1800s, the instrument was significantly popular across parts of South America, notably Argentina and Uruguay; compared to the standard concertina, which was and is widely utilised in various genres of folk and traditional music, the bandoneon&#x27;s original intended use was to only be played for Christian devotional or religious ceremonies, such as masses (liturgy), weddings, and other related holy or sacred events.

== Related instruments ==
In the related woodwind instruments, a vibrating reed is used to set a column of air in vibration within the instrument. In such instruments, the pitch is primarily determined by the effective length of that column of air. Although the Chinese sheng, Japanese sho and Laotian khene have pipes, the pipes do not determine the pitch. In these instruments, the pipes serve as resonating chambers.

The pump organ and Indian harmonium instruments also use free reeds.

<doc id="222618" wikidata="Q247505" url="?curid=222618" title="Charles Meryon">
<text>Charles Meryon (sometimes Méryon, 23 November 1821 – 14 February 1868) was a French artist who worked almost entirely in etching, as he had colour blindness. Although now little-known in the English-speaking world, he is generally recognised as the most significant etcher of 19th century France. His most famous works are a series of views powerfully conveying his distinctive Gothic vision of Paris. He also had mental illness, dying in an asylum.

Meryon&#x27;s mother was a dancer at the Paris Opera, who moved to London around 1814 to dance there. In 1818 she had a daughter by Viscount Lowther, the future William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale, a wealthy aristocrat and politician, and 1821 Charles Meryon by Dr Charles Lewis Meryon, an English doctor, returning to Paris for the birth, and remaining there for the rest of her life. The household in Paris was supported financially by both fathers, but more so by Lowther, whose indirect funding remained important throughout Meryon&#x27;s life; he made very little money from his art.

Starting at the age of 16, Meryon spent ten years as a naval cadet and finally officer, which included tours of the Mediterranean, and a four year voyage around the world, for most of it based in New Zealand, where the French then maintained an imperial toe-hold. On his return he fought and was wounded in a pro-government militia during political disturbances in 1848. 
He had become seriously interested in art during his naval career, starting to take lessons. He gradually and reluctantly realized that his colour-blindness ruled out painting, and by 1848 settled on etching, then out of favour as a medium for fine art, though about to undergo a considerable revival. His best period lasted between 1850 and about 1856, before his increasing mental illness reduced his output. He spent fourteen months in an asylum in 1858 and 1859, then continued to work until 1866, when he re-entered the asylum for the final time.

==Birth and childhood==
Meryon&#x27;s mother, Pierre-Narcisse Chaspoux, was a Parisian, born in 1791, who became a dancer in the Paris Opera in 1807 with the stage name of Narcisse Gentil. Her appearances there stop in 1814, and it was presumably about this time that she moved to London, where she became the mistress of Viscount Lowther, the future William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale, then an unmarried Tory MP, junior minister, and friend of the Prince Regent. She had a daughter Frances (Fanny) by him in 1818. She was also friendly with Dr Charles Lewis Meryon, who had been a fellow boarder at 10 Warwick Street, Charing Cross, off Cockspur Street, around 1818. In 1821, when she was appearing as a dancer at the London Opera, Pierre-Narcisse became pregnant by Meryon, and returned to Paris with Fanny, Dr Meryon having left for Florence. Charles Meryon was born in the rue Rameau, round the corner from the then site of the Opera.

His father, Dr Meryon, had been working at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital at this time, but had spent the years 1810 to 1817 in the Middle East as (at that point unqualified) doctor to the aristocratic traveller Lady Hester Stanhope, who he was later to visit in Lebanon three times, seeing her for the last time in 1838. He continued to correspond with Pierre-Narcisse, and pay maintenance for his son, probably of 600 francs a year. The letters became increasingly uncomfortable, and she only found out about his marriage, which had been in 1823, by accident in 1831. Equally, Pierre-Narcisse was rather more generously supported by Lowther, who saw her and Fanny when he was in Paris, but she was keen to keep him unaware of the existence of Charles, although the two fathers were acquaintances in London. Both fathers apparently continued to know her under her stage name of &quot;Narcisse Gentil&quot;.

Charles was registered at birth as a &quot;Chaspoux&quot;, and eventually (in 1829) baptised in the Church of England by the chaplain of the British Embassy in Paris. In 1824 his father legally acknowledged paternity, and he was re-registered as &quot;Meryon&quot;, although apparently usually known as &quot;Gentil&quot; as a child. For over a year after his birth he lived with friends of his mother some 20 kilometres outside Paris, visited not very frequently by his mother, sister and grandmother. He could walk at 9 months. He was moved back to Paris in January 1823, and from late 1825 Fanny was at a boarding school.

By late in 1826 he had entered the &quot;Pension Savary&quot;, one of a number of small boarding schools in the Paris suburb of Passy; Camille Pissarro was a pupil some years later. He remained there until 1836, apart from a period with his father in 1834–35, and it seems to have been a generally happy time in his life. In 1834 his father, with his wife and children, was living in Marseille, where Charles joined them for an extended visit in May 1834; he had previously seen him on a few occasions. They spent the winter in north Italy, reaching as far as Florence; Charles was back in Paris by May 1835. Although in most respects he enjoyed the visit, and had happy memories of it, it appears that &quot;the relationships within the family were not explained&quot; to Charles, and perhaps other members, and this, the last time he would see his father, contributed to a growing resentment Charles felt towards him.

Meryon&#x27;s mother died in October 1838, when he was already in the French Naval School in Brest in Brittany. After this his half-sister Fanny went to live in England, where she married in 1840. She remained in touch with him for the rest of his life. He had his grandmother still in Paris, until her death in 1845, and various cousins and family friends in and around Paris.

==In the Navy==
===Training===
Meryon later said that he first became attracted to a naval career by &quot;the animation of the quays of Marseilles&quot;, on his visit to his father, and from his letters to his father it is clear this had become a clear intention by the end of 1835. He entered the Naval school in Brest in November 1837, having come 47th in the competitive entry exam, out of 68 candidates who passed.

By the end of his first half-year he was ranked 15th, then 19th six months later. By September 1839 he was 11th out of 60 remaining in his class. He &quot;consistently scored a near-perfect mark in Drawing&quot;, did well in English (after greatly improving this when with his father) and Gunnery. The training in drawing covered not only making charts and sketches of coastlines, important skills for naval officers, but &quot;picturesque and linear&quot; drawing of heads and landscapes.

The school for future naval officers had only been founded in 1827. It was based on the ship &quot;Orion&quot; and the course lasted two years. The pupils almost never set foot on shore, and Meryon&#x27;s claim to have not done so for 22 months seems plausible. The routine and discipline were harsh, but Meryon made life-long friends, including Ernest Mouchez.

Meryon joined his first ship, the &quot;Alger&quot; at Toulon in October 1839, as a cadet, second class. Initially he lodged onshore. After a trip to Algiers carrying troops, the ship left Toulon to join the French Levant squadron in the Aegean Sea in February 1840, allowing Meryon to visit Athens, Corinth, Argos, Melos and Mycenae. In April 1840 he transferred to the &quot;Montebello&quot; near modern İzmir (then Smyrna) in Turkey, with which he revisited Greece, then France, before visiting Tunis, then of great political interest to the French, and Carthage. In January 1842 he was promoted to cadet, first class.

===Voyage around the world===

In the corvette &quot;Le Rhin&quot; he made a voyage round the world from 1842 to September 1846. The purpose of the voyage was to promote French interests in New Zealand, which the French government was not yet ready to accept as wholly a British territory; there were also French whaling interests to protect. A small French settlement on the South Island had been established on an earlier voyage. The French naval &quot;New Zealand station&quot; was to end while the &quot;Rhin&quot; was returning home, when the replacement ship, the &quot;Seine&quot;, was wrecked on the coast of New Caledonia.

The French base in New Zealand was Akaroa, or Port Louis-Philippe as the French still called it, then a small whaling-station, with a mostly French population. The &quot;Rhin&quot; reached it on 18 January 1843, and was replaced in April 1846. The outward voyage began on 15 August 1842, heading across the Atlantic, passing Tenerife, but not landing until Bahia in Brazil was reached in October, where they spent nearly two weeks. They then changed direction, rounding the Cape of Good Hope, and arriving at Hobart, Tasmania in late December, staying only a week, before sailing for Akaroa, which they reached on 11 January 1843.
Relations between the French and British populations, and even their officials, were cordial or friendly, despite the British tightening their control over this period, for example restricting the fishing rights allowed to French boats. But both sides were aware the question of French claims would be settled back in Europe. In May and June 1843 the &quot;Rhin&quot; visited Wellington for ten days, then Auckland. In October they set off for Australia, via Kororareka near the tip of the North Island, today Russell, New Zealand, where they stayed until early November. Less than 18 months later the so-called Flagstaff War between the British and Māori was to break out there. In November Meryon was, back in Paris, promoted to ensign, the lowest rank of naval officer, although the news did not reach him on the &quot;Rhin&quot; until July the next year.

At the end of August 1844 the &quot;Rhin&quot; sailed for Valparaiso in Chile &quot;to buy stores, particularly wine, which was very expensive in Sydney&quot;. After staying two weeks they set off on the return voyage on 6 November 1844, stopping at the Marquesas and Tahiti, which had just come under French &quot;protection&quot;, and where there were a total of seven French naval ships at that point. The &quot;Rhin&quot; reached Akaroa again on 8 February 1845, hoping to find that its replacement ship had arrived, and they could return to France. But the ship had not come, and in March tensions between the Maori and Europeans had sharply increased, increasing the warmth of local Franco-British relations.

The replacement ship &quot;Seine&quot; finally arrived on 8 March 1846, and the &quot;Rhin&quot; set sail for home on the 16th. They passed Cape Horn in early May, and landed at Saint Helena on 14 June, staying a week. Meryon&#x27;s visit to Napoleon&#x27;s final home would come to haunt him in later years. After a brief stop at Ascension Island, they passed into the Mediterranean and spent four days at the French North African port of Mers El-Kebir from 18 August. They finally landed at Toulon on 28 August, four years and 13 days after they left it.

===Art during his naval career===
Meryon had sketched in Athens, Algiers and other exotic places he had visited, and by late 1840 decided to take lessons in drawing from the Toulon artist Vincent Courdouan, who was then 30. He had thought of painting in watercolour, but decided he did not have time to learn this at first, but studied using sepia washes. He took full watercolour up in November 1841, when a letter to his father is the first documented mention of his colour-blindness; possibly he had not realized he had the condition before. At this time he seems to have hoped the condition would improve. Courdouan&#x27;s style made much use of strong contrasts of light and dark tones, which is also characteristic of Meryon&#x27;s art in the 1850s.

Throughout his voyage on the &quot;Rhin&quot; he made drawings, many of which he turned into etchings some twenty years later. He also dabbled in sculpture, having bought some plaster of Paris in Sydney in 1843. He made busts and heads of Maori people, none of which have survived. After a dead whale washed up at Akaroa he made a coloured plaster model of whale nearly two metres long, which was later placed on display in the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle (National Museum of Natural History) in Paris, before being transferred to the Muséum d&#x27;Histoire naturelle de La Rochelle (in La Rochelle) in 1926.

A number of drawings he made of Maori men with heavily tattooed faces survive, but most of his drawings from the voyage show landscapes, houses, or boats sailing near the coast. His drawing of full human figures (or animals) shows his lack of training, but these views of areas where very few Western artists had reached by the 1840s are rather conventional. Some critics have been intrigued by the contrast between his lack of artistic engagement with the very different visual cultures he encountered on his voyage, some at this date relatively little subdued by Western expansion, and his exploration of his return to Paris of a sometimes sinister exoticism based on Gothic Paris. In particular &quot;Le Stryge&quot; has the forceful demonic energy which at that date French culture often attributed to exotic cult images from parts of the world where the West was just reaching.

In his last Paris etchings, or his last revisions of them, the fantastic flying creatures that appear in the sky in prints like &quot;Le Ministere de la Marine&quot; (&quot;The Admiralty&quot;), the last Paris scene, of 1865, include fishing boats from Oceania, and whales hunted or ridden, by harpoon-wielding horsemen. In this case the figures in the sky were present from the first state of the print.

==Return to Paris==

On his return from the &quot;Rhin&quot; voyage in August 1846, Meryon was given eight months leave, and went to Paris. He hoped, and rather expected, to be placed at the end of his leave with the team working on the official scientific publication of the voyage, especially as regards the illustrations; the French Navy had a tradition of taking these books very seriously.

In July 1847 he visited his sister Fanny in London, where she lived with her husband Henry Broadwood, like Fanny&#x27;s father a Conservative Member of Parliament, from the piano-making family. The visit to London was notable for his refusal to visit his father, who was then living there. The two had corresponded during the &quot;Rhin&quot; voyage, and the day he docked in Toulon he wrote to his father offering to visit him in Nice, not realizing he was no longer there. In London, and in the main art cities of Belgium, which he visited on his way back to Paris, he spent much of his time on conventional museum visiting, also going to the theatre in London.

1848 saw rising political tensions in Paris, which overthrew the monarchy in February and culminated in the June Days uprising, when Meryon&#x27;s immediate neighbourhood saw some intense fighting around the barricades thrown up by the insurgents. He was a member of the National Guard (probably obligatory for a naval officer on leave), which played a crucial role in resisting the uprising on behalf of the French Second Republic, which Meryon generally supported. He &quot;spent almost three days in the street, broken only by hours snatched for sleep&quot;, and was slightly wounded.

In May 1847, when his extended leave came to an end, he should have returned to Toulon, but had not. The work on the naval publication, and much else in naval administration, had been thrown into confusion by the political situation, and in July 1848 Meryon decided to resign his commission, possibly to prepare his own book on the voyage, but apparently also because of his health, his doubts about his ability to command men, and because his next posting was unclear. Because he had not reported back to Toulon, at least months of his pay were caught in a bureaucratic tangle, recorded at great length in the naval records. Although the final recommendation for a ministerial decision, the following March, supported paying him, it is not clear whether this actually happened. Several of the memorandums mention his dire financial circumstances.

==Professional artist==
In a letter to his father dated 5 November 1846 Meryon announced that he was &quot;getting ready to give myself completely to the study of Art&quot;. He first approached a minor pupil of Jacques-Louis David, who worked at the War Ministry, who agreed to take him as a student in August 1847, setting him drawing exercises copying famous classical statues and drawings, in the &quot;conventional&quot; academic curriculum. An early notebook (1847–48) with an ambitious list of possible subjects shows a predominance of maritime subjects, many with specific settings drawn from his voyage, such as a scene of Maoris fighting and an &quot;Assassination of Captain Cook&quot; (in Hawaii in 1779). 
At least two finished pastel drawings survive from this period: a dramatic whaling scene, and the &quot;Assassination of Captain Marion du Fresne in New Zealand&quot; (by Maoris in 1772, at the Bay of Islands, killing 27 in total). Meryon knew the setting well, and the work was exhibited in the annual Paris Salon at the Louvre in 1848. In 1883 it was turned into an etching by Victor-Louis Focillon (father of the art historian Henri Focillon), which was adapted as a book illustration. His drawing is now in the National Library of New Zealand, and remains the best known depiction of the incident.

The drawing seems to have been intended to be redone on a larger scale in oils, and many writers on Meryon have thought that it was the failed attempt to do this that made Meryon realize the impossibility of pursuing a career in a technique using colour. In early 1848 he met the engraver Eugène Bléry, who according to some accounts had taken an interest in his du Fresne drawing. Bléry (1805–87) was a respected and technically very competent etcher, mostly producing landscapes. A precursor of the Etching Revival, he worked in front of his chosen scene not just in making drawings, but etching his plates. Unlike Meryon, he had little interest in architectural subjects, but both enjoyed strong contrasts of light and dark. Meryon later claimed that his long-term aim in learning printmaking was to participate in illustrating an account, either the official one or his own, of the voyage of the &quot;Rhin&quot;.

Meryon joined Bléry&#x27;s workshop, and was soon on excellent terms with him and his family. In September 1848 he joined Mme Bléry and her daughter on a holiday, and sketching tour, in Normandy for several weeks, when M Bléry could not leave Paris. By December he had accepted an invitation to move in to their house. He started to produce etchings, mostly copying landscape and animal paintings, or other prints, that allowed him to develop his technique, and could also be sold print-dealers, if only for modest sums.

He entered the studio of the engraver Eugène Bléry, from whom he learnt something of technical matters, and to whom he always remained grateful. Méryon had no money, and was too proud to ask help from his family. He was forced to earn a living by doing work that was mechanical and irksome. Among learners&#x27; work, done for his own advantage, are to be counted some studies after the Dutch etchers such as Zeeman and Adriaen van de Velde. Having proved himself a skilled copyist, he began doing original work, notably a series of etchings which are the greatest embodiments of his greatest conceptions—the series called &quot;Eaux-fortes sur Paris.&quot; These plates, executed from 1850 to 1854, are never found as a set and were never expressly published as such, but they nonetheless constituted in Méryon&#x27;s mind an harmonious series.

==Mature work==

Besides the twenty-two etchings &quot;sur Paris&quot;, Meryon did seventy-two etchings of one sort and another ninety-four in all being catalogued in Frederick Wedmore&#x27;s &quot;Méryon&quot; and &quot;Méryon&#x27;s Paris&quot;; but these include the works of his apprenticeship and of his decline, adroit copies in which his best success was in the sinking of his own individuality, and more or less dull portraits. Yet among the seventy-two prints outside his professed series there are at least a dozen famous ones. Three or four beautiful etchings of Paris do not belong to the series at all. Two or three others are devoted to the illustration of Bourges, a city in which the old wooden houses were as attractive to him for their own sakes as were the stonebuilt monuments of Paris. Generally it was when Paris engaged him that he succeeded the most. He would have done more work if the material difficulties of his life had not pressed upon him and shortened his days.

He was a bachelor, yet almost as constantly occupied with love as with work. The depth of his imagination and the surprising mastery which he achieved almost from the beginning in the technicalities of his craft were appreciated only by a few artists, critics and connoisseurs, and he could not sell his etchings or could sell them only for about lod. apiece. Disappointment told upon him, and, frugal as was his way of life, poverty must have affected him. He became subject to hallucinations. Enemies, he said, waited for him at the corners of the streets; his few friends robbed him or owed him that which they would never pay. A few years after the completion of his Paris series he was placed in the asylum at Charenton. Briefly restored to health, he came out and did a little more work, but at bottom he was exhausted. In 1867 he returned to his asylum, and died there in 1868. In middle age, just before he was confined, he associated with Félix Bracquemond and Léopold Flameng, skilled practitioners of etching. The best portrait we have of him is one by Bracquemond under which the sitter wrote that it represented &quot;the sombre Méryon with the grotesque visage.&quot;

There are twenty-two pieces in the &quot;Eaux-fortes sur Paris&quot;. Some of them are insignificant. That is because ten out of the twenty-two were destined as headpiece, tailpiece, or running commentary on some more important plate. But each has its value, and certain of the smaller pieces throw great light on the aim of the entire set. Thus, one little plate—not a picture at all—is devoted to the record of verses made by Méryon, the purpose of which is to lament the life of Paris. Méryon aimed to illustrate its misery and poverty, as well as its splendour. His etchings are no mere views of Paris. They are &quot;views&quot; only so far as is compatible with their being likewise the visions of a poet and the compositions of an artist.

Méryon&#x27;s epic work was coloured strongly by his personal sentiment, and affected here and there by current events — in more than one case, for instance, he hurried with particular affection to etch his impression of some old-world building which was on the point of destruction, as Napoleon III tore down buildings to reconstruct Paris with wide boulevards. Nearly every etching in the series reveals technical skill, but even the technical skill is exercised most happily in those etchings which have the advantage of impressive subjects, and which the collector willingly cherishes for their mysterious suggestiveness or for their pure beauty.

Méryon also taught; among his pupils was the etcher Gabrielle-Marie Niel.

==Style==

The &quot;Abside de Notre Dame&quot; is the general favourite and is commonly held to be Méryon&#x27;s masterpiece. Light and shade play wonderfully over the great fabric of the church, seen over the spaces of the river. As a draughtsman of architecture, Méryon was complete; his sympathy with its various styles was broad, and his work on its various styles unbiased and of equal perfection—a point in which it is curious to contrast him with J. M. W. Turner, who, in drawing Gothic architecture, often drew it with want of appreciation. It is evident that architecture must enter largely into any representation of a city, however much such representation may be a vision, and however little a chronicle. Even the architectural portion of Méryon&#x27;s labour is only indirectly imaginative; to the imagination he has given freer play in his dealings with the figure, whether the people of the street or of the river or the people who, when he is most frankly or even wildly symbolical, crowd the sky.

Generally speaking, his figures are, as regards draughtsmanship, &quot;landscape-painter&#x27;s figures.&quot; They are drawn more with an eye to grace than to academic correctness. But they are not &quot;landscape-painter&#x27;s figures&quot; at all when what we are &#x27;concerned with is not the method of their representation but the purpose of their introduction. They are seen then to be in exceptional accord with the sentiment of the scene. Sometimes, as in the case of &quot;La Morgue&quot;, it is they who tell the story of the picture. Sometimes, as in the case of &quot;La Rue des Mauvais Garçons&quot;—with the two passing women bent together in secret converse—they at least suggest it. And sometimes, as in &quot;L&#x27;Arche du Pont Notre Dame&quot;, it is their expressive gesture and eager action that give vitality and animation to the scene.

Dealing perfectly with architecture, and perfectly, as far as concerned his peculiar purpose, with humanity in his art, Méryon was little called upon by the character of his subjects to deal with Nature. He drew trees but badly, never representing foliage happily, either in detail or in mass. But to render the characteristics of the city, it was necessary that he should know how to portray a certain kind of water—river-water, mostly sluggish—and a certain kind of sky—the grey obscured and lower sky that broods over a world of roof and chimney. This water and this sky Méryon is thoroughly master of; he notes with observant affection their changes in all lights.

In his technique, Méryon experimented variously in his brief career, and at times within individual works. In two different impressions of his Paris view &quot;La Pompe Notre Dame de Paris&quot; (1852) he could employ crisp lines through a well wiped plate without surface tone, or leave softer edges and richer darks by ample surface tone. His aesthetics were often dictated by his paper, of which he endeavored to acquire the finest available. His more defined works he printed on &#x27;Hudelist&#x27; paper, from a mill in Hallines in the North of France, which had the uniform, smooth quality ideal for sharp images. His more gauzy works, by contrast, were printed on a softer, felt-like Morel Lavenere paper produced in Glaignes, which was highly absorbent—and pale green, which Méryon in his colour blindness would not have perceived as the typical viewer. Ultimately, however, his stated preference was for cleanly-wiped, clear prints of a uniform quality, which determination ironically positioned him against the Etching Revival he helped inspire.

==Mental illness==
As early as his voyage on the &quot;Rhin&quot; in his naval period, Meryon had displayed behaviours that were initially interpreted as eccentricity, for which there was considerable tolerance in Parisian artistic circles, but later came to be seen by friends as &quot;the beginnings of a dysfunction&quot;. By the mid-1850s he had periods of depression when he could do nothing, and developed a conviction that he was being persecuted by Emperor Napoleon III; he traced this to &quot;tactless words on the abuse of force&quot; which he had inscribed in 1846 in the visitor&#x27;s book at Longwood, Saint Helena, where Napoleon I had died. He thought several other artists who had died had been done away with by the government, probably by poison.

He developed an obsession with a very young girl in the neighbourhood, Louise Neveu, who lived next door to him between at least 1851 and 1856. His &quot;aggressive and persistent but unsuccessful courting&quot; was an attempt to marry her, for which he negotiated with her parents through a friend. Her father &quot;thought him potentially violent&quot;, and he later &quot;threatened visitors with a pistol&quot;. There may have been another young girl, as various accounts mention the daughter of the owner of the restaurant where he usually ate, who was not Neveu. Several accounts mention his obsessive digging-up of the back-garden of the house he was staying, apparently looking for buried bodies.

In 1858 he agreed to admit himself to the leading Charenton asylum, a doctor having certified him as &quot;suffering from a profound disturbance of the mental faculties&quot; on 10 May. Two days later, his initial examination at Charenton assessed him as having &quot;Deep melancholy, ideas of persecution which he considers to be deserved. depressive ideas. he considers himself deeply guilty towards Society.&quot; This stay lasted fourteen months until 10 September 1859, by which time he was assessed as improved, including by himself in a later letter.

After seven years, during which both his life and his art had shown signs that his condition had remained with him to some degree, he was readmitted to Charenton for the final time on 10 October 1866. Their records of &quot;regular monthly assessments offer a story of persistent violent outbursts, intense melancholy, recurrent hallucinations and the conviction that even his old friends were conspiring against him&quot;. Although he was sometimes well enough to be taken out for trips, his condition deteriorated, he stopped eating, and he died in Charenton on 14 February 1868.
Retrospective diagnoses assess Meryon&#x27;s behavior exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia.

==Value of Meryon&#x27;s prints==
===To 1911===
It is worthwhile to note the extraordinary enhancement in the value of Méryon&#x27;s prints. Probably of no other artist of genius, not even of Whistler, could there be cited within the same period a rise in prices of at all the same proportion. Thus the first state of the &quot;Stryge&quot; – that &quot;with the verses&quot; – selling under the hammer in 1873 for £5, sold again under the hammer in 1905 for £100. The first state of the &quot;Galerie de Notre Dame&quot; – selling in 1873 for £5 and at M. Wasset&#x27;s sale in 1880 for £11, fetched in 1905, £52. A &quot;Tour de l&#x27;Horloge,&quot; which two or three years after it was first issued sold for half a crown, in May 1903 fetched f70. A first state (Wedmore&#x27;s, not of course M. Delteil&#x27;s &quot;first state,&quot; which, like nearly all his first states, is in fact a trial proof) of the &quot;Saint Étienne du Mont,&quot; realizing about £2 at M. Burty&#x27;s sale in 1876, realized £60 at a sale in May 1906. The second state of the &quot;Morgue&quot; (Wedmore) sold in 1905 for £65; and Wedmore&#x27;s second of the &quot;Abside,&quot; which used to sell throughout the seventies for £4 or £5, reached in November 1906 more than £200. At no period have even Dürers or Rembrandts risen so swiftly and steadily.

===Modern===
Though while alive he sold prints for francs, in 2014 prints were for sale under US$1000. Four of the Paris prints sold at Christie&#x27;s in London for £4,375 in 2009, but an especially good impression of one of these had fetched £11,500 in 1998. In 2018 Meryon&#x27;s etchings fetch on the market (in the UK) from between £1,500 to £7,500 GBP.

<text>The City of Portland was a named passenger train on the Union Pacific Railroad between Chicago, Illinois, and Portland, Oregon. The first trip left Portland on June 6, 1935, using the streamlined M-10001 trainset. With only one set of equipment, the train left each terminal six times a month. A broken axle derailed the trip that left Chicago on July 23, 1935, and the repaired train resumed service with the trip leaving Portland on February 6, 1936. In May 1936 it started running five times a month instead of six, allowing more time in Chicago between trips. (In July 1935 it was scheduled to arrive Chicago at 9:30 AM and leave at 6:15 PM the same day.)

It was the first streamliner with sleeping cars and the first streamliner running from Chicago to the Pacific coast; its 39-hour-45-minute schedule became the standard. (In April 1935 the fastest train took 59 hr 20 min Chicago to Portland.) The M-10001 was withdrawn in March 1938 and replaced with another articulated trainset, the former &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; M-10002. In July 1941 M-10002 was replaced with a train powered by the EMC E3 set inherited from &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; pulling the former M-10004 cars, with some former M-10001 cars added. Service was expanded following the war as the train was joined, then replaced, by full-size trains powered by E6 and E7 locomotives. The train was the first of the 40-hour Coast streamliners to run daily, in February 1947. Starting in October 1955 the Milwaukee Road was used instead of the Chicago and North Western between Chicago and Omaha; from January 1959 until 1967 the train ran via Denver. The train was discontinued May 1, 1971, with the takeover of Union Pacific&#x27;s passenger services by Amtrak. The route roughly follows the trail of the defunct Amtrak route, the &quot;Pioneer,&quot; except that the latter diverted to Ogden, Utah, while the &quot;City of Portland&quot; did not enter Utah.

In addition to baggage, coach, and sleeping cars, about 1955 the &quot;City of Portland&quot; added an Astra Dome dome coach, dome observation lounge and dome dining car to each consist. The dome dining cars were unique to Union Pacific and were only operated on this train and the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;.
