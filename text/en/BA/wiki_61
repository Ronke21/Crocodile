<text>Bryn Mawr College ( ; Welsh: ) is a private women&#x27;s liberal arts college in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded as a Quaker institution in 1885, Bryn Mawr is one of the Seven Sister colleges, a group of historically women&#x27;s colleges in the United States. The college has an enrollment of about 1,350 undergraduate students and 450 graduate students. It was the first women&#x27;s college to offer graduate education through a PhD.

== History ==
Bryn Mawr College is a private women&#x27;s liberal arts college founded in 1885. The phrase literally means &#x27;large hill&#x27; in Welsh. The Graduate School is co-educational. It is named after the town of Bryn Mawr, in which the campus is located, which had been renamed by a representative of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Bryn Mawr was the name of an area estate granted to Rowland Ellis by William Penn in the 1680s. Ellis&#x27;s former home, also called Bryn Mawr, was a house near Dolgellau, Merioneth, Gwynedd, Wales. The college was largely funded through the bequest of Joseph W. Taylor, and its first president was James Rhoads. Bryn Mawr was one of the first institutions of higher education in the United States to offer graduate degrees, including doctorates, to women. The first class included 36 undergraduate women and eight graduate students. Bryn Mawr was originally affiliated with the Quakers (Religious Society of Friends), but by 1893 had become non-denominational.

In 1912, Bryn Mawr became the first college in the United States to offer doctorates in social work, through the Department of Social Economy and Social Research. This department became the Graduate School of Social Work and Social Research in 1970. In 1931, Bryn Mawr began accepting men as graduate students, while remaining women-focused at the undergraduate level.

From 1921 to 1938 the Bryn Mawr campus was home to the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, which was founded as part of the labor education movement and the women&#x27;s labor movement. The school taught political economy, science, and literature.

The college celebrated its 125th anniversary of &quot;bold vision, for women, for the world&quot; during the 2010–2011 academic year. In September 2010, Bryn Mawr hosted an international conference on issues of educational access, equity, and opportunity in secondary schools and universities in the United States and around the world. Other festivities held for the anniversary year included publication of a commemorative book on 125 years of student life, and, in partnership with the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, the creation of a mural in West Philadelphia highlighting advances in women&#x27;s education.

=== Transgender students ===
On February 9, 2015, the college&#x27;s board of trustees announced approval of a working group recommendation to expand the undergraduate applicant pool allowing transgender women and intersex individuals identifying as women to apply for admission. This decision made Bryn Mawr the fourth women&#x27;s college in the United States to accept trans women. Bryn Mawr &quot;recognizes that gender is fluid and that traditional notions of gender identity and expression can be limiting&quot;, and has the official policy of accepting nonbinary students who were assigned female at birth as well. All current, past, and future students are fully recognized as members of the Bryn Mawr community, regardless of current gender identity.

== Campus ==
The campus is in the municipality of Lower Merion Township. Most of the campus is in the Bryn Mawr census-designated place.

The campus was designed in part by noted landscape designers Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, and has subsequently been designated an arboretum (the Bryn Mawr Campus Arboretum).

=== Student residences ===
The majority of Bryn Mawr students live on campus in residence halls. Many of the older residence halls were designed by Cope &amp; Stewardson (same architects who designed a large part of Washington University in St. Louis and Princeton University) and are known for their Collegiate Gothic architecture, modeled after Cambridge University. Each is named after a county town in Wales: Brecon, Denbigh (1891), Merion (1885), and Radnor (1887), and Pembroke East and West (1892). Rhoads North and South was named after the college&#x27;s first president, James E. Rhoads; Rockefeller is named after its donor, John D. Rockefeller. Erdman was opened in 1965, designed by architect Louis Kahn. In addition, students may choose to live in Batten House (an environmentally friendly co-op). Perry House, which was originally established as the Spanish language house in 1962, was redefined as the Black Cultural Center in the 1970s. In 2015, Perry House was relaunched by the college in the former French tower of Haffner, which had undergone renovations and reconstruction the previous year. Along with Perry, now known as the Enid Cook &#x27;31 Center, a new residence hall was built where the old Haffner Language and Culture House once stood.

Glenmede (formerly graduate student housing) is an estate located about a half mile from the main campus which at one point was available housing for undergraduate students. In 2007, it was sold to a conservation buyer as the annual costs of upkeep were too great for the college.

=== Blanca Noel Taft Memorial Garden ===
In 1908, John C. Olmsted designed a private garden for M. Carey Thomas adjoining the Deanery. The garden was later modified and renamed as the Blanca Noel Taft Memorial Garden. In its current form, the garden is a small enclosure with two wall fountains, one with a small basin and the other with a sunken reflecting pool. The decorative wall tiles above the smaller wall fountain and basin were purchased from Syria.

=== Erdman Hall dormitory ===

In 1960, architect Louis I. Kahn and Bryn Mawr College president, Katharine Elizabeth McBride, came together to create the Erdman Hall dormitory.

=== Marjorie Walter Goodhart Theater ===

The Marjorie Walter Goodhart Theater houses a vaulted auditorium designed by Arthur Ingersoll Meigs of Mellor, Meigs &amp; Howe, two smaller spaces that are ideal for intimate performances by visiting artists, practice rooms for student musicians, and the Office for the Arts. The building&#x27;s towers and gables, friezes, carvings and ornamental ironwork, designed by Samuel Yellin, were done in the gothic revival style. In the fall of 2009, the college completed a renovation of Goodhart.

===Old Library (previously M. Carey Thomas Library and College Hall) ===

Previously named after Bryn Mawr&#x27;s first Dean and second president, Old Library was used as the primary campus library until 1970, when Mariam Coffin Canaday Library opened. The Great Hall (formerly the reading room of the library) was designed by Walter Cope (of Cope and Stewardson) in 1901 and built by Stewardson and Jamieson several years later, although M. Carey Thomas played a large part in its construction. Today, it is a space for performances, readings, lectures, and public gatherings. Old Library encloses a large open courtyard called &quot;The Cloisters&quot;. The cremated remains of M. Carey Thomas and Emmy Noether are located in the Cloisters. Georgiana Goddard King is also buried in the cloister. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1991. The Great Hall was once the home of an Athena Lemnia statue (damaged in 1997) that is now located in a high alcove in the Rhys Carpenter Art and Archaeology Library. A plaster cast of that Athena now stands in her place at the Great Hall. Students often leave offerings to this statue in the hope that she will intervene on their behalf. In 2018, the board of trustees formalized the use of the name &quot;The Old Library&quot;.

Old Library was formerly known as &quot;Thomas Hall&quot; after Bryn Mawr&#x27;s second president, M. Carey Thomas. The building was informally known as &quot;College Hall&quot; for a year before being officially renamed to &quot;Old Library&quot; in 2018. This renaming was in response to student protests, which claimed that many of M. Carey Thomas&#x27;s views did not represent the values of the college. Student protesters identified that M. Carey Thomas was a virulent eugenicist, antisemite and racist who strongly opposed the admission of students who were not elite white women. Today, the building houses a plaque explaining the controversy of the former name and affirming the college&#x27;s current dedication to equity and inclusion, which was unveiled during the 2019 Community Day of Learning.

=== Rhys Carpenter Art and Archaeology Library ===

Named for Bryn Mawr&#x27;s late professor of Classical Archaeology, the Rhys Carpenter Library was designed by Henry Myerberg of New York and opened in 1997. The space is connected to the rear of Old Library. The entrance is a four-story atrium. Names of art and archaeology faculty are displayed on the main wall of the atrium, along with a series of plaster casts of the metopes of the Parthenon. The roof comprises a wide grassy area used for outdoor concerts and picnics. The building won a 2001 Award of Excellence for Library Architecture from the Library Administration and Management Association and the American Institute of Architects. Carpenter Library also houses the college&#x27;s renowned collections in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology, History of Art, and Classics.

=== The Deanery ===

The Bryn Mawr College Deanery was the campus residence of the first Dean and second President of Bryn Mawr College, M. Carey Thomas, who maintained a home there from 1885 to 1933. Under the direction of Thomas, the Deanery was gradually enlarged and elaborately decorated with the assistance of the American artist Lockwood de Forest and furnished with art from Thomas&#x27; world travels. From 1933 until 1968, the Deanery served as the Alumnae Center and Inn for the college. The building was demolished in the spring of 1968 to make space for the construction of Canaday Library, which stands on the site today. At the time of its demolition, many of the Deanery&#x27;s furnishings were re-located to Wyndham, an 18th-century farmhouse (with several modern additions) which became the college&#x27;s new Alumnae Center.

== Academics ==
Bryn Mawr is a small, four year, residential baccalaureate college. Although the college offers several graduate programs, the majority of enrollments are from students enrolled in the undergraduate arts and sciences program.

Students at Bryn Mawr are required to complete divisional requirements in the social sciences, natural sciences (including lab skills) and humanities. In addition, they must complete one year of a foreign language and fulfill a quantitative skills requirement and an Emily Balch Seminar requirement. The Emily Balch Seminars are similar to courses in freshman composition at other institutions, though focus on a specific topic. The seminars stress development of critical thinking skills and are discussion-based, with &quot;intensive reading and writing.&quot;

Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*English Language and Literature (31)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (27)
*Psychology (24)
*Mathematics (23)
*Computer Science (22)
In 1972, the college founded a year-long post baccalaureate pre-medical program for career changers. The program remains one of the oldest, most prestigious, and successful in the country — with an over 98% medical school acceptance rate.

===Admissions===

For the Class of 2023 (enrolling fall 2019), Bryn Mawr received 3,332 applications, admitted 1,102 (30%), and enrolled 374 students. For the freshmen who enrolled, the middle 50% range of SAT scores was 640–740 for evidence-based reading and writing, and 650–770 for math, while the middle 50% ACT composite score range was 29–33.

== Traditions ==

Students celebrate four major traditions throughout the year, along with other minor traditions. Parade Night, which happens on the Friday of the first week of classes, is a tradition where the freshman class runs to Taylor Hall, while the upperclassmen throw confetti. Following this, the first of the three “Step Sings” takes place, during which the student body sing various traditional and pop songs. The second is Lantern Night, which takes place in late October or early November, where first year students receive a lantern which symbolizes the passing down of knowledge, during a traditional ceremony with songs in Ancient Greek. Welcome the First Years Week, formerly known as Hell Week, takes place during the early part of the semester between February and March. It is a time where students complete silly tasks and attend special events created for them by an upperclassman (called a rose) who the freshman (called a bud) personally selects. May Day is held on the Sunday after the last day of classes, not on the traditional date of May 1. It includes a breakfast of strawberries and cream, a parade, dancing around the traditional Maypole, a feminist alternative called the Mayhole, and student performances. Dar Williams&#x27;s song &quot;As Cool As I Am&quot; has become part of May Day, as the song is played during the Mayhole celebration. The song is even called an &quot;unofficial anthem&quot; for the school.

The traditions are organized and run by two Traditions Mistexes, elected by the student body. In addition to major traditions, there are a number of minor traditions. These include offerings to a statue of Athena for luck or thanks, using a set of stairs leading up to Taylor Hall called the Senior Steps or down Senior Row, a row of trees in the center of campus unless a student is a senior. The Friendship Poles, a set of two vertical poles located under the main arch of the Pembroke Dorms, are not supposed to be split by a group walking through, or else those who “split the poles” will no longer be friends. Additional traditions and superstitions surround the college campus and its facilities and buildings.

== Sustainability ==
Bryn Mawr has signed the American College and University President&#x27;s Climate Commitment, and in doing so, the school agreed to make all new buildings comply with a LEED silver standard or higher; to purchase Energy Star products whenever possible; and to provide and encourage the use of public transportation. The school&#x27;s dining halls strive to be environmentally sustainable by working to expand their local and organic offerings, recycling in all dining areas, and recycling used fry oil as bio-diesel fuel. The dining halls previously offered biodegradable takeout containers, but reverted to Styrofoam in the 2009/10 academic year. Additionally, all leftover food is donated to a local food bank. On the College Sustainability Report Card 2011, published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, Bryn Mawr received a B+. The school&#x27;s highest category score was an A in Investment Priorities, since Bryn Mawr invests in renewable energy funds.

== Athletics ==
Bryn Mawr plays in the Centennial Conference and fields intercollegiate teams in badminton, basketball, cross country, field hockey, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor and outdoor track and field, and volleyball. The badminton team won national intercollegiate championships in 1996 and 2008. The mascot of the college is the owl, the symbol of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom.

<text>The Mackinac Center for Public Policy () is a think tank headquartered in Midland, Michigan. Through research and programs, the Mackinac Center supports lower taxes, reduced regulatory authority for state agencies, right-to-work laws, school choice, and property rights. It has been variously described as free market, conservative, fiscally conservative, and nonpartisan. It prefers the description &quot;free market&quot; over &quot;conservative&quot; because it does not emphasize social issues.

Joseph Overton (1960–2003), a senior vice president of the Mackinac Center, stated the political strategy that later became known as the Overton window. Overton said that politically unpopular, unacceptable policies must be changed into politically acceptable policies before they can be enacted into law.

The Mackinac Center is said to be the largest state-based free market think tank. It was ranked among the top 5 percent of think tanks in the United States by the &quot;2018 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report&quot;. The Center sponsors MichiganVotes.org, an online legislative voting record database which provides a non-partisan summary of every bill and vote in the Michigan legislature.

==History==

The organization was founded in 1987. In a 2011 interview, founder Joe Olson said that the Center was first conceived in a Lansing, Michigan bar at a meeting between Olson, fellow insurance company executive Tom Hoeg, Richard McLellan and then-Michigan Senate Republican majority leader John Engler, who would later become governor. Olson said the founders wanted an organization that would focus on research, writing, speaking, issuing press releases and looking at public policy from a free market point of view.

The Center began operations with no office or full-time staff. It formally opened offices in Midland in 1988 with its first president, Lawrence W. Reed, an economist, writer, and speaker who had chaired the economics department at Northwood University. The Lansing-based Cornerstone Foundation provided early direction and some funding. The Center&#x27;s first annual budget under Reed was $80,000. In 1999, the Mackinac Center moved from rented offices to its current headquarters after having raised $2.4 million to renovate a former Woolworth&#x27;s department store on Midland&#x27;s Main Street.

The Mackinac Center is classified as a 501(c)(3) organization under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. It is a member of the State Policy Network of state-level conservative and libertarian think tanks.

The Mackinac Center published a 20-point plan for state fiscal reform, with Governor John Engler fully or partially implementing 16 of those recommendations during his first term in office. In 1994, Engler said, &quot;When the Mackinac Center speaks, we listen&quot;.

When asked by Detroit&#x27;s &quot;Metro Times&quot; in 1996, the Center&#x27;s President Lawrence Reed said: &quot;Our funding sources are primarily foundations ... with the rest coming from corporations and individuals,&quot; but that &quot;... revealing our contributors would be a tremendous diversion...&quot;

In 2001, Mackinac Center was described as &quot;the leading advocate for a universal education tax credit&quot; by a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial.

In 2002, the Michigan Education Association (MEA) sued the Mackinac Center over the Center&#x27;s use of a supportive quote by the MEA&#x27;s President in fundraising material. In 2004, the Michigan Court of Appeals threw out the lawsuit.

In November 2006 &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a two-part series about state-based &quot;conservative&quot; think tanks that described how the Mackinac Center trained think-tank executives from 42 countries and nearly every US state. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also reported that, &quot;When the Mackinac Center was founded in 1987, there were just three other conservative state-level policy institutes. Now there are 48, in 42 states.&quot;

Reed served as president from the Center&#x27;s founding until September 2008, when he assumed the title President Emeritus and also became the president of the Foundation for Economic Education. Former Chief Operating Officer Joseph G. Lehman was named the Mackinac Center&#x27;s president on September 1, 2008.

In 2014, the organization released a mobile app, VoteSpotter. The app allows users to track votes by elected officials in the United States. It was originally an extension of the organization&#x27;s MichiganVotes.org website but has since expanded to include other states.

The Mackinac Center in 2018 led several conservative groups urging teachers to leave unions with a national campaign called &quot;My Pay, My Say&quot;.

In 2019, a satellite office was opened in Lansing, Michigan.

The Mackinac Center has criticized &quot;sin taxes&quot; like tobacco excise taxes, vaping regulations and a variety of alcohol rules. It received donations from Altria in the 2010s, according to a 2019 investigation by &quot;The Guardian&quot; about connections between the tobacco industry and free-market groups.

The Mackinac Center fought in court against the Biden administration&#x27;s efforts to cancel some student loan payments and extend pandemic-related pauses on loans.

The Mackinac Center&#x27;s director of energy and environmental policy was a contributor to the Project 2025 plan anticipating Donald Trump&#x27;s second term as president of the United States. The Mackinac Center was removed from the Project 2025 credits after a request by the center. A Mackinac Center spokesperson said that it had &quot;offered ideas on labor and energy policy&quot; to the Heritage Foundation, which created Project 2025, but that &quot;we do not endorse&quot; some other ideas in the plan.

=== Coining of the term &quot;Overton Window&quot; ===
The concept of the &quot;Overton window&quot; was introduced in the 1990s by Joseph Overton, former senior vice president of the Mackinac Center. After his death in a plane crash in 2003, his colleague Joseph Lehman named the idea in a presentation about the power of consistent and persistent advocacy. The &quot;Overton window&quot; refers to the range of ideas which are considered culturally and politically fringe to mainstream, and when a subject matter moves along this spectrum it is considered to have changed its status along the &quot;Overton window&quot;. The Mackinac Center defines the Overton Window as:...a model for understanding how ideas in society change over time and influence politics. The core concept is that politicians are limited in what policy ideas they can support — they generally only pursue policies that are widely accepted throughout society as legitimate policy options. These policies lie inside the Overton Window. Other policy ideas exist, but politicians risk losing popular support if they champion these ideas. These policies lie outside the Overton Window.

== Legal advocacy ==
The Mackinac Center Legal Foundation is a non-profit, pro-bono organization associated with the Mackinac Center for Public Policy focusing on advancing liberty and free markets.

According to the Mackinac Center, its key areas of focus include: labor law, property law, constitutional law and laws pertaining to healthcare in America.

In 2020, the Mackinac Center Legal Foundation initiated a lawsuit against Governor Gretchen Whitmer, which ultimately led to the Michigan Supreme Court issuing a unanimous decision in favor of the Mackinac Center. The court declared that Governor Whitmer&#x27;s attempts to extend a state of emergency beyond April 30, 2020, without legislative approval was illegal. Additionally, in a 4-3 decision, the Court ruled that the Emergency Powers of Governor Act of 1945, which Governor Whitmer had cited as the basis for maintaining unilateral control for an indefinite period, is unconstitutional. Consequently, all executive orders issued after April 30 are currently considered null and void.

=== Lawsuits involving Michigan Education Association (MEA) ===

==== &quot;Michigan Education Association v. Mackinac Center for Public Policy&quot; ====
In 2002 the Michigan Education Association (MEA) and its president, Luigi Battaglieri, sued the Mackinac Center for quoting Battaglieri in a fundraising letter highlighting its effectiveness. The MEA argued that commercial speech case law required the Mackinac Center to obtain permission for using the quotation. However, the Court concluded that the quotation in the fundraising letter &quot;falls squarely within the protection of the First Amendment for discourse on matters of public interest.&quot;

==== &quot;Mackinac Center Legal Foundation v. Michigan Education Association&quot; ====
In January 2022, the Mackinac Center Legal Foundation filed a lawsuit against the Michigan Education Association (MEA) and its insurance affiliate, the Michigan Education Special Services Association (MESSA). The lawsuit was filed under the federal False Claims Act, maintaining that these labor unions improperly sought and received $12.5 million in COVID-19 relief money through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

The Paycheck Protection Program, which was intended to provide relief to small businesses, was not designed for 501(c)(5) nonprofits like the MEA or 501(c)(9) nonprofits like MESSA. Despite this, both organizations applied for and received funding through the PPP in April 2020, with the MEA receiving $6.4 million and MESSA receiving $6.1 million. In December 2020, the MEA and MESSA reportedly returned the funds.

The Mackinac Center Legal Foundation filed the lawsuit on the grounds that the actions of the MEA and MESSA deprived other businesses of relief funds during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fourteen months after the lawsuit was filed, the case was settled in favor of the Mackinac Center. As part of the settlement, the MEA and MESSA agreed to pay $200,000 in reimbursements and fines. Additionally, the two union organizations agreed to pay the Mackinac Center $77,000 in attorneys fees, and the federal government paid the Mackinac Center $23,000 for discovering the improper loans.

==Positions==
The Center writes that its ideology is most accurately characterized as flowing from the &quot;classical liberal tradition&quot; of Milton Friedman and others: &quot;socially tolerant, economically sophisticated, desiring little government intervention in either their personal or economic affairs.&quot; In a 2011 interview about the organization, one of its founders, Olson, said &quot;Some will say the Mackinac Center is a Republican front&quot; but that he disagreed.

The Mackinac Center was involved in the effort to pass a right-to-work law in Michigan and has supported efforts in other states to expand right to work laws and workers&#x27; rights to not pay dues to a union they do not support. The Center also launched the website MyPayMySay.com to alert union members to their rights.

==Funding==

In 2022, the foundation&#x27;s total revenue was $11.5 million, and its expenditures were $11.5 million, according to ProPublica.

Between 2008 and 2013, the Mackinac Center received $2.4 million from DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund used by conservative philanthropists, according to a liberal group called the Bridge Project. Donor-advised funds allow individuals, foundations and charities to give money anonymously. DonorsTrust has been used by the Koch family and other donors. The funding was for statehouse reporting and attendance at meetings of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).

==Publications and projects==
In addition to policy studies, the Center publishes a number of periodicals including &quot;Michigan Education Report&quot;, &quot;Michigan Privatization Report&quot;, &quot;Michigan Science&quot;, &quot;Michigan Capitol Confidential&quot;, &quot;Impact&quot;, &quot;Michigan Education Digest&quot; and &quot;Michigan Context and Performance Report Card&quot;.

=== &quot;Michigan Capitol Confidential&quot; ===
&quot;Michigan Capitol Confidential&quot; is a nonprofit news service published by the Mackinac Center. It provides news and analysis of Michigan-specific issues, including state and local government policies, education, and economics.

=== MichiganVotes ===
MichiganVotes is a project whose primary objective is to facilitate access to information regarding historical and ongoing legislative actions. Its users have the capability to search for bills by their respective numbers, categories, or keywords. This platform is designed by Mackinac Center with the aim to enable individuals to stay informed about various legislations and to ensure that their elected officials are held responsible for their actions.

<text>Jacopo della Quercia (, ; 20 October 1438), also known as Jacopo di Pietro d&#x27;Agnolo di Guarnieri, was an Italian sculptor of the Renaissance, a contemporary of Brunelleschi, Ghiberti and Donatello. He is considered a precursor of Michelangelo.

==Biography==

Jacopo della Quercia takes his name from Quercia Grossa (now Quercegrossa), a place near Siena, Tuscany, where he was born in 1374. He received his early training from his father, Piero d&#x27;Angelo, a woodcarver and goldsmith. Jacopo della Quercia, a Sienese, must have seen the works of Nicola Pisano and Arnolfo di Cambio on the pulpit in the cathedral of Siena and this must have influenced him. His first work may have been at the age of sixteen, an equestrian wooden statue for the funeral of Azzo Ubaldini. 
In 1386 he and his father moved to Lucca, owing to party strife and disturbances.

It is likely that della Quercia studied the huge collection of Roman sculptures and sarcophagi in the Camposanto in Pisa. These and later influences made him a transitional figure in the history of European art; his work shows a pronounced mid-career shift from the Gothic style to that of the Italian Renaissance. As in the case of Ghiberti, this development probably results from exposure to his contemporary, Donatello.

Della Quercia&#x27;s earliest work (though this attribution is sometimes contested) appears in the Lucca cathedral: &quot;Man of Sorrows&quot; (Altar of the Sacrament) and a relief on the tomb of &quot;St. Aniello&quot;. In 1401 he entered a competition to design the bronze doors for Florence&#x27;s Baptistery, but lost to Ghiberti. The unsuccessful entry&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown.

In 1403 he sculpted the marble &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; for the Ferrara cathedral. Another (possible) work from his period in Ferrara is the statuette of &quot;St. Maurelius&quot; (both on in display in the Museo del Duomo).

Back again in Lucca in 1406, he received the commission from the city&#x27;s ruler, Paolo Guinigi, to begin work at the tomb of his second wife Ilaria del Carretto in the Lucca cathedral. The richly dressed woman rests on top of the sarcophagus, delicately portrayed in a Gothic fashion, with her dog, a symbol of conjugate fidelity, at her feet. But his use of several nude putti at the flanks of the tomb clearly shows the classical influence of the Roman sarcophagi at Camposanto (Pisa). This is a first, a harbinger of the incipient Renaissance.

==Fonte Gaia in Siena==
In 1406 he was asked to build a new fountain in the Piazza del Campo in Siena. It had to replace the original fountain with a statue of the goddess Venus. This pagan statue was blamed for an outbreak of the Black Plague. The statue was destroyed and buried outside the city walls to avert its &quot;evil influence&quot;. This prestigious commission shows that he was already being recognized as Siena&#x27;s most prominent sculptor. The rectangular fountain, built in white marble, was dedicated to the Virgin, adorned on the three sides by many statues and multiple spouts. Because he accepted also other commissions at the same time, progress was slow. He started in 1414 and the fountain was only finished in 1419. He carved the panels in the workshop for sculptors, next to the cathedral. This workshop is now converted into the Cathedral Museum. It was called &quot;Fonte Gaia&quot;, because of the joy and the festivities when it was brought into operation. It is now a centre of attraction for many tourists. The old statues were replaced by copies in 1858 from Tito Sarrocchi and are now on display in the lower levels at Santa Maria della Scala.

==Other works==
In 1412, contracted by a wealthy merchant Lorenzo Trenta, he started the design of the Trenta Chapel in the basilica of San Frediano in Lucca. In 1413 he was accused, together with his assistant Giovanni da Imola, of serious crimes: theft, as well as rape and sodomy of one Clara Sembrini. He fled to Siena (and began working on the Fonte Gaia), but his assistant was incarcerated for three years. Jacopo della Quercia only would return to Lucca in March 1416, given a letter of safe conduct. He continued at the Trenta Chapel on the marble altar and several statues of saints, contained in niches. Some work was also performed by his assistant. Jacopo also designed the tomb slabs of Lorenzo Trenta and his wife Isabetta Onesti, on the pavement in front of the altar.

When in 1416 Lorenzo Ghiberti was asked to design a hexagonal basin with bronze panel for the Baptistery in Siena, political infighting brought Jacopo della Quercia into the project (who had been his competitor for the bronze doors in Florence). He only completed one bronze relief &quot;The Annunciation to Zacharias&quot; because he was working at the same time on the Fonte Gaia and the Trenta Chapel. His lingering on this project brought him in legal difficulties with the authorities. Since he had been rejected in the competition for the &quot;Doors of Paradise&quot; in Florence, he had been reluctant to work with bronze. And when he worked on the tabernacle of the baptistery, he insisted on taking care only of the marble part.

In 1421 he carved an &quot;Annunciation&quot;, in a different style, with two wooden polychromed statues &quot;Virgin&quot; and &quot;Gabriel&quot; for the Collegiata in San Gimignano (the polychrome finishing was done by other masters, such as Martino di Bartolomeo). The sophistication of this group, equal to the quality of his marble statues, shows that he was also versatile in woodcarving. This led some authors to ascribe other wooden statues to him, but most are attributable to his very active workshop.

In his later years, he became even more active, working on different projects simultaneously. In 1427 he received the commission to design the upper part of the baptismal font for the Siena Baptistery. This hexagonal column, resting on a pillared base in the middle of the basin, contains five prophets situated in niches. The marble statue of &quot;St. John the Baptist&quot;, at the top of the dome above the tabernacle, is also attributed to Jacopo della Quercia.

==Porta Magna in Bologna==
In 1425 he accepted another major commission: the design of the round-arched Porta Magna of the San Petronio church in Bologna. It would keep him busy for a good deal of the last thirteen years of his life and it is considered his masterwork. Each side of the door is flanked, first by a colonette with a spirally wound decoration, then nine busts of prophets and at the end five scenes from the Old Testament, carved into somewhat lower relief. In the &quot;Creation of Adam&quot;, he uses the same arrangement as in the &quot;Fonte Gaia&quot; (in Siena), but in reverse order. Michelangelo, who had visited Bologna in 1494, conceded that his Genesis on the Sistine Chapel ceiling was based on these reliefs (birth of Eve shown at right). The architrave above the door contains five reliefs with representations from the New Testament. The lunette contains three free-standing statues: &quot;Virgin and Child&quot;, &quot;Saint Petronius&quot; (with a model of Bologna in his right hand) and &quot;Saint Ambrose&quot; (carved by another sculptor Domenico Aimo in 1510). Originally this third statue had to represent the papal legate Cardinal Alemmano, but this intention was quickly abandoned after the cardinal had been evicted from Bologna. He relied heavily on the artists of his Bolognese workshop, such as Cino di Bartolo, for assistance in this project.

While working at the Porta Magna, he was asked in 1434 by the Sienese to design the Loggia di San Paolo, close to the Piazza del Campo. He was not able to finish this commission. At his death, he had only finished the capitals and six niches.

In his final years, he was awarded several honours by the Sienese. In 1435 he was knighted and given the important position of Operaio of the cathedral.

In his final years, he was also involved in the decoration of the chapel of Saint Sebastian (destroyed in 1645) for the cardinal Casini in the cathedral of Siena, but, as part of a relief of the cardinal, most works were done by his Siena workshop. This carved high relief, &quot;Cardinal Antonio Casini presented to the Virgin by St. Anthony of Egypt&quot;, is on display in the Hall of Statues in the Cathedral Museum.

Jacopo della Quercia died at Siena on 20 October 1438. He was buried in the San Agostino church in Siena.

He was already held in high esteem by his contemporaries, such as Lorenzo Ghiberti, Antonio Filarete and Giovanni Santi. Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Jacopo della Quercia in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;.

<text>The Seven Summits are the highest mountains on each of the seven traditional continents. On 30 April 1985, Richard Bass became the first climber to reach the summit of all seven. 

In January 2023, &quot;Climbing&quot; said &quot;Today, the Seven Summits are a relatively common—almost cliché—tour of each continent&#x27;s highest peak&quot;, and while reaching the peak of the &quot;Seven Summits&quot; is no longer considered a significant achievement amongst mountaineers, it remains a popular challenge for &quot;adventure mountaineers&quot; using expedition climbing techniques.

==Definitions==
The Seven Summits consist of the highest mountain peak on each of the continents. Different lists include slight variations, but generally, the same core is maintained. The seven summits depend on the definition used for a continent – in particular the location of the border of that continent. This results in two major points of variation. The first one is Mont Blanc versus Mount Elbrus for Europe, which depends on whether the crest of the Greater Caucasus Mountains is taken to define the Greater Caucasus watershed which marks the continental boundary between Asia and Europe for the region between the Black and Caspian seas; this classification would place Mount Elbrus in Europe. The second one is Puncak Jaya (also known as &quot;Carstensz Pyramid&quot;) versus Mount Kosciuszko for the continent of Australia, which depends on whether one includes the Sahul Shelf or only mainland Australia as the continent. This also gives rise to another list called the &quot;Eight Summits&quot;, which includes both Puncak Jaya and Mount Kosciuszko along with the six summits on the other continents.

This creates several possible versions of the seven summits:

*Everest, Aconcagua, Denali (Mount McKinley), Kilimanjaro, Vinson, Elbrus, Mount Wilhelm (Continent)
*Everest, Aconcagua, Denali, Kilimanjaro, Vinson, Elbrus, Kosciuszko (the Bass version)
*Everest, Aconcagua, Denali, Kilimanjaro, Vinson, Elbrus, Puncak Jaya (the Messner version)
*Everest, Aconcagua, Denali, Kilimanjaro, Vinson, Mont Blanc, Mount Wilhelm (the Wilhelm version) 
*Everest, Aconcagua, Denali, Kilimanjaro, Vinson, Mont Blanc, Kosciuszko (the 1950s explorer Hackett version)
*Everest, Aconcagua, Denali, Kilimanjaro, Vinson, Mont Blanc, Puncak Jaya
*Everest, Aconcagua, Denali, Kilimanjaro, Vinson, Mauna Kea, Puncak Jaya / Kosciuszko (the tectonic version)

The concept Richard Bass and his climbing partner Frank Wells were pursuing was to be the first to stand atop the highest mountain on each continent. They pursued this goal as they defined it, climbing Aconcagua for South America, Denali for North America, Kilimanjaro for Africa, Elbrus for Europe, Vinson for Antarctica, Kosciuszko for Australia, and finally Everest for Asia.

=== Safety and climbing preference ===
In terms of safety and preference for climbers, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has affected Western climbers&#x27; ability to travel to Russia, making Elbrus less attractive. Similarly, Puncak Jaya in New Guinea has been closed due to security concerns and the risks posed by ongoing tribal conflicts and mining operations. These challenges have prevented climbers from accessing the area, further complicated by a security lockdown since August 2019. The situation escalated in February 2023 when Papuan rebels of Free Papua Movement took New Zealand pilot Philip Mark Mehrtens hostage, an event known as Nduga hostage crisis, signaling a new level of risk for foreigners in New Guinea highlands. The rebels&#x27; declaration of &quot;all foreigners are now target&quot; marked an intensification of the conflict, making travel to New Guinea highly advised against. Consequently, many climbers postponed their expedition to climb Carstensz Pyramid until the regional conflict subsides.

In summary, the Mount Wilhelm version of the Seven Summits currently presents the safest option for climbers, avoiding travel to Russia and New Guinea. Papua New Guinea remains a relatively safer option for mountaineers, and Mount Wilhelm offers an excellent high mountain expedition experience as the highest peak in Oceania.

===Definition using tectonic plates===
Using the largest tectonic plates, Asia and Europe could be grouped as Eurasia, and the very large Pacific Plate would have Mauna Kea as its highest mountain. Puncak Jaya is actually on the Maoke Plate, while Mount Wilhelm is depending upon evolving plate tectonic understanding, on either the Trobriand Plate, Solomon Sea Plate or Woodlark Plate, all of whom were historically grouped with the larger Australian Plate. If not, then Mount Kosciuszko would revert to being the highest of that plate (see also list of highest points of Oceanian countries).

*African Plate – Kilimanjaro
*Antarctic Plate – Vinson 
*Australian Plate – Puncak Jaya / Kosciuszko
*Eurasian Plate – Mount Everest
*North American Plate – Denali 
*Pacific Plate – Mauna Kea
*South American Plate – Aconcagua

==Oceania==
The highest mountain in mainland Australia is Mount Kosciuszko, above sea level. However, the highest mountain on the Australian continent, which includes Australia and New Guinea, is Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid), above sea level, in the Indonesian province of Central Papua on the island of New Guinea, which shares the Sahul continental shelf with Australia. Mount Kosciuszko is considerably easier to climb, being a four-hour, grade 3 return walk from the nearest car park, while Puncak Jaya is classed as a mountaineering expedition with technical climbing, an approach through dense jungle and the need to charter an aircraft.

Some sources claim Mount Wilhelm () in Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Bismarck Range (on the island of New Guinea, like Puncak Jaya) as the highest mountain on the Australian continent, on account of Indonesia being a part of Asia (see list of Southeast Asian mountains, which includes Puncak Jaya and other mountains in Western New Guinea, Indonesia). However, such a definition is political, not geophysical, and would mean that the western part of New Guinea changed continents in 1969.

In terms of Australia as a country, Mawson Peak () is higher than Kosciuszko. However, it is not located in Oceania, but on the Australian external territory of Heard Island, part of an island group in the southern Indian Ocean. While Mt McClintock () is located within the claimed Australian Antarctic Territory and is also claimed as Australia&#x27;s highest peak, it is again not in Oceania. 
If excluding the island of New Guinea, then Aoraki / Mount Cook on the South Island of New Zealand is the highest mountain in Australasia at .

Sources that list Mount Wilhelm as the highest point in Oceania or show boundaries putting Puncak Jaya in Asia include: the United Nations, 7 Continent Summits, World Atlas, the CIA World Factbook, Canada Atlas, and Papua New Guinea PNG Trekking.

==Europe==
The generally accepted highest summit in Europe is Mount Elbrus () in the Caucasus, appearing on both the Bass and Messner lists. However, because the location of the boundary between Asia and Europe is not universally agreed upon, its inclusion in Europe is disputed: if the Kuma–Manych Depression is used as the geological border between Asia and Europe, the Caucasus and Elbrus lie wholly in Asia. If the Greater Caucasus watershed is used instead, Elbrus&#x27; peaks are wholly in Europe, albeit close to the border with Asia. Mont Blanc (), lying on the border between France and Italy in the Graian Alps, is seen by some to be the highest mountain in Europe.

==North America==
Denali is the highest mountain peak in North America. The Caribbean Plate and the Panama Plate, both of which share geological processes with the North American continent, have their own highest mountain peaks:

*North America – Denali ()
*Caribbean Plate – Acatenango Volcano () 
*Panama Plate – Mount Chirripó ()

==South America==
Aconcagua is the highest mountain peak in South America. The Altiplano Plate and the North Andes Plate, both of which share geological processes with the South American continent, have their own highest mountain peaks:

*South America – Aconcagua ()
*Altiplano Plate – presumably Nevado Sajama ()
*North Andes Plate – Chimborazo ()

==Bass and Messner lists==
The first Seven Summits list as postulated by Bass (the Bass or Kosciusko list) chose the highest mountain of mainland Australia, Mount Kosciuszko (), to represent the Australian continent&#x27;s highest summit. Reinhold Messner postulated another list (the Messner or Carstensz list), replacing Mount Kosciuszko with Indonesia&#x27;s Puncak Jaya, or Carstensz Pyramid (). Neither the Bass nor the Messner list includes Mont Blanc. From a mountaineering point of view, the Messner list is the more challenging one. Climbing Carstensz Pyramid has the character of an expedition, whereas the ascent of Kosciuszko is an easy hike. Indeed, Patrick Morrow used this argument to defend his choice to adhere to the Messner list, &quot;Being a climber first and a collector second, I felt strongly that Carstensz Pyramid, the highest mountain in Australasia ... was a true mountaineer&#x27;s objective.&quot;



===History===
In 1956, William D. Hackett (1918–1999), an American mountaineer, reached the top of five continents. He climbed Denali (then known as Mount McKinley) (1947), Aconcagua (1949), Kilimanjaro (1950), Kosciuszko (1956) and Mont Blanc (1956). At that time, Mont Blanc was considered to be the highest mountain of the European continent. Hackett made an attempt to climb Mount Vinson and obtained a permit for Mount Everest in 1960, but due to several circumstances (frostbite, lack of funds, etc.), he never made it to more than five summits.

In 1970, the Japanese mountaineer and adventurer Naomi Uemura (1941-1984) was the first person to reach five of the Seven Summits including Mount Everest. He climbed Mont Blanc (1966), Kilimanjaro (1966), Aconcagua (1968), Mount Everest (1970 solo) and Denali (1970 solo). After the first solo trip to the North Pole (1978), he planned to go on his own to Antarctica to climb Mount Vinson. In preparation for the Antarctica expedition, he did a solo winter ascent of Denali (1984). On the descent he disappeared in a winter storm.

In 1978, the Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner was the first person to reach six of the Seven Summits (1971 Puncak Jaya, 1974 Aconcagua, 1976 Denali (Mount McKinley), 1978 Kilimanjaro, 1978 Mount Everest). For Messner, Carstensz Pyramid (Puncak Jaya) was the highest peak in Australia (Messner list), but in 1983, he climbed Mount Kosciuszko to also satisfy the other geographic definition of Australia. In the same year, Messner climbed Mount Elbrus and declared that it was the true highest peak in Europe. This definition was quickly accepted by others in the mountaineering community. Finally in 1986, he climbed Mount Vinson. At that time, he was only the fifth person to reach the Seven Summits.In 1985, Richard Bass, a businessman and amateur mountaineer, was the first man to climb all Seven Summits. In only one year, 1983, he climbed six peaks: Aconcagua, Denali, Kilimanjaro, Mount Elbrus, Mount Vinson and Mount Kosciuszko. All of these climbs he did together with his companion Frank Wells and different mountain guides. Beginning in 1983, Bass and Wells made various guided attempts to climb Mount Everest, the highest and most difficult peak in the list. On 30 April 1985, Bass reached the summit of Mount Everest in a party without Wells, guided by the American professional mountaineer David Breashears. He then co-authored the book &quot;Seven Summits&quot;, which covered the undertaking. Later in 1985, American mountaineer Gerry Roach became the second person to climb the Seven Summits.

In 1986, the Canadian mountaineer Patrick Morrow became the first man to climb the Seven Summits in the Carstensz version (Messner list). He climbed Denali (1977), Aconcagua (1981), Mount Everest (1982), Kilimanjaro (1983), Mount Kosciuszko (1983), Mount Vinson (1985), Mount Elbrus (1985) and finally the Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid) on May 7, 1986. Morrow was also the first to complete both lists (Bass and Messner).

In 1990, Rob Hall and Gary Ball became the first to complete the &quot;Seven Summits&quot; in seven months. Using the Bass list, they started with Everest on 10 May 1990, and finished with Vinson on 12 December 1990, hours before the seven-month deadline.

In 1992, Junko Tabei became the first woman to complete the &quot;Seven Summits&quot;. Mary &quot;Dolly&quot; Lefever became the first American woman to climb the &quot;Seven Summits&quot; on March 11, 1993, when she climbed Australia&#x27;s Mount Kosciuszko. Earlier in 1993, she had become the oldest surviving woman to have reached the summit of Mount Everest; she was 47 years old. In January 1996, Chris Haver became the first American to climb and ski all seven summits. Yasuko Namba was famous in her native Japan for becoming the second Japanese woman to reach all of the Seven Summits including Everest, where she died during the storm of May 1996 during her descent.

In 2000, Croatian mountaineer Stipe Božić completed the Seven Summits. In May 2002, Susan Ershler and her husband, Phil, became the first married couple to climb the &quot;Seven Summits&quot; together. The first person to climb the Seven Summits without using supplemental oxygen on Mount Everest is Reinhold Messner. Miroslav Caban is the second climber to finish the project without supplemental oxygen on Everest (finished in 2005 with Carstensz). Ed Viesturs also summitted all peaks without supplemental oxygen. Between 2002 and 2007, Austrian climber Christian Stangl completed the Seven Summits (Messner list), climbing alone and without supplemental oxygen, and reported a record total ascent time from respective base camp to summit of 58 hours and 45 minutes.

On 17 May 2006, Rhys Jones became the youngest person to complete the Seven Summits (Bass list) at the age of exactly 20 years. Notable climbers who had previously been the youngest to complete the Seven Summits include Rob Hall in 1990 and David Keaton in 1995. In May 2007, Samantha Larson completed the seven at the age of 18 years and 220 days (she is still the youngest woman to have climbed the Seven Summits). Johnny Strange finished climbing the summits at the age of 17 years and 161 days in June 2009. On 26 May 2011, at 6:45 Nepali time, Geordie Stewart became the youngest Briton to complete the Seven Summits at the age of 22 years and 21 days. In 2009-10, Indian mountaineer Krushnaa Patil made a bid for the fastest woman to complete the challenge; she fell short of the challenge when, in May 2009, her seventh and final summit bid on Denali was halted by her guide&#x27;s illness. George Atkinson then became the youngest person in the world to complete the round aged 16 years 362 days. On 24 December 2011, the record was once again beaten, by American Jordan Romero, who completed the challenge at the age of 15 years, 5 months and 12 days by climbing Vinson.

In October 2006, Kit Deslauriers became the first person to have skied down (parts of) all seven peaks (Bass list). Three months later, in January 2007, Swedes Olof Sundström and Martin Letzter completed their Seven Summits skiing project by skiing down (parts of) Carstensz Pyramid, thus becoming the first and only people to have skied both lists.

Indian mountaineer Malli Mastan Babu also had the eminence of setting a Guinness world record by surmounting the Seven Summits in 172 days in 2006. The world record for completion of the Messner and Bass list was 136 days, by Danish climber Henrik Kristiansen in 2008. Kristiansen completed the summits in the following order: Vinson on Jan 21, Aconcagua on Feb 6, Kosciuszko on Feb 13, Kilimanjaro on Mar 1, Carstensz Pyramid on Mar 14, Elbrus on May 8, Everest on May 25, spending just 22 days on the mountain (normally, expeditions take up to two months acclimatizing, laying ropes, etc.) and finally Denali on June 5, beating Ian McKeever&#x27;s previous record by 20 days. Vern Tejas set the new record for the same, in 134 days. Tejas began with summiting Vinson on 18 January 2010 and ended with summiting Denali on May 31. This was Tejas&#x27; ninth time to complete the Bass Seven Summits.

In January 2010, the Spanish climber Carlos Soria Fontán, at the age of 71, completed the seven summits (Messner list) after reaching the summit of Kilimanjaro. He climbed the first one in 1968. On 23 May 2010, AC Sherpa summited Mount Everest as his last and final conquest of the Seven Summits (Bass list). In doing this, he set a new record by climbing the Seven Summits within 42 climbing days. Additionally, when climbing Mount Kilimanjaro (via Marangu) he summited in just 16 hours and 37 minutes, easily beating the previous record of 18 hours.

On 24 December 2011, it was reported that only 118 people had climbed the Seven Summits if one assumes &quot;full&quot; completion of the quest requires climbing the &quot;Eight Summits&quot; across both the Bass and Messner lists (climbing both Carstensz Pyramid and Kosciusko in addition to the other six &quot;undisputed&quot; summits such as Everest). 231 persons have climbed the Messner list, while 234 have completed the Bass list. 348 have done either the Bass or Messner list.

In 2013, Vanessa O&#x27;Brien became the fastest female to complete the Seven Summits (including Carstensz Pyramid), finishing in 10 months. Cason Crane became the first openly gay man to climb the Seven Summits. On 21 November 2013, Werner Berger (Canada, ex-South African), at the age of 76 years and 129 days, became the oldest person in the world to complete the Seven Summits after a 6-day jungle trek to Carstensz Pyramid. In 2013, Cheryl and Nikki Bart became the first mother-daughter team to complete the Seven Summits.

On 16 December 2014, Tashi and Nungshi Malik became the world&#x27;s first twins and siblings to complete the Seven Summits (Messner list). Colin O&#x27;Brady broke the record for the Messner and Bass lists in 131 days, summiting Vinson on 17 January 2016 and completing with Denali on 27 May 2016.

The youngest person to complete both the Seven Summits and the Volcanic Seven Summits is Satyarup Siddhanta from India. He completed the feat on 15 Jan 2019 after summitting Mt Sidley, Antarctica at the age of 35 years 261 days breaking the record of Daniel Bull from Australia. He was also the first Indian to accomplish the feat and created a Guinness world record.

On 6 January 2018, Chris Bombardier reached the summit of Mount Vinson, becoming the first person with hemophilia to complete the Seven Summits (Messner list). On 23 June 2018, Silvia Vasquez-Lavado reached the summit of Denali, becoming the first openly gay woman to complete the Seven Summits (including Carstensz Pyramid). On 4 January 2019, Arunima Sinha reached the summit of Mount Vinson, becoming the first female amputee to complete the Seven Summits (including Carstensz Pyramid).

===Criticism===

Alpinism author Jon Krakauer (1997) wrote in &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; that it would be a bigger challenge to climb the second-highest peak of each continent, known as the Seven Second Summits – a feat that was not accomplished until January 2013. This discussion had previously been published in an article titled &quot;The Second Seven Summits&quot; in Rock &amp; Ice Magazine (#77) authored by the mountaineer and Seven Summits completer David Keaton. This is especially true for Asia, as K2 (8,611 m) demands greater technical climbing skills than Everest (8,848 m), while altitude-related factors such as the thinness of the atmosphere, high winds and low temperatures remain much the same. Some of those completing the seven ascents are aware of the magnitude of the challenge. In 2000, in a foreword to Steve Bell et al., &quot;Seven Summits&quot;, Morrow opined &quot;[t]he only reason Reinhold [Messner] wasn&#x27;t the first person to complete the seven was that he was too busy gambolling up the 14 tallest mountains in the world.&quot;
In January 2023, a writer for &quot;Climbing&quot; said &quot;Today, the Seven Summits are a relatively commonalmost clichétour of each continent&#x27;s highest peak&quot;, and that the real challenge was the Explorer&#x27;s Grand Slam, the Seven Summits with the North and South poles.

===Defence===
Bill Allen, who completed the Seven Summits twice, said that getting to the summit never gets old. The 8000ers are all in East Asia; Nepal, China, India and Pakistan in a more narrow region of Earth, and many of the climbs are quite dangerous with several climbers dying short of completing all 14. Another problem is that while there are 14 main summits, there are additional sub-peaks over 8000 m. Indeed, in 2013, authorities were considering officially recognizing some additional peaks as 8000ers.

==Second and third lists==

The Seven Second Summits collection is considered to be a more difficult mountaineering challenge than the standard Seven Summits, even if the peaks are lower. Like the number one list, the number two and three lists are subject to the Bass vs. Messner geophysical/political dichotomy.
;Number twos
*Asia-K2
*South America-Ojos del Salado (&quot;Eyes of Salt&quot;)
*North America- Mount Logan
*Europe-Dykh-Tau (&quot;Jagged Mount&quot;)
*Africa-Mount Kenya
*Antarctica-Mount Tyree 
*Oceania-Puncak Mandala (formerly &quot;Juliana Peak&quot;)
*Oceania-Mount Townsend

A Seven Second Summits collection was first achieved in January 2013 by Christian Stangl.

<doc id="220865" wikidata="Q7711975" url="?curid=220865" title="The 700 Club">
<text>The 700 Club is the flagship television program of the Christian Broadcasting Network, airing each weekday in syndication in the United States and available worldwide on CBN.com. The news magazine program features live guests, daily news, political opinion commentary, contemporary music, testimonies, and Christian ministry. Celebrities and other guests are often interviewed, and Christian lifestyle issues are presented. The program additionally features world news stories plus investigative reporting by the CBN News team.

&quot;The 700 Club&quot; has been in production since 1966 and was initially hosted by Jim Bakker, as well as being hosted by Gordon Robertson, Terry Meeuwsen, Ashley Key, Wendy Griffith and Andrew Knox. Previous co-hosts include Pat Robertson (1966–1987; 1988–2021), Ben Kinchlow (1975–1988, 1992–1996), Sheila Walsh (1987–1992), Danuta Rylko Soderman (1983–1988), Kristi Watts (1999–2013), and Lisa Ryan (1996–2005). Tim Robertson served as host for a year (1987–88) along with Kinchlow and actress Susan Howard, while Pat Robertson ran unsuccessfully for President in the 1988 campaign.

== History ==
In 1960, Pat Robertson, the son of former U.S. Senator Absalom Willis Robertson, purchased the license for WTOV-TV, channel 27 in Portsmouth, Virginia (unrelated to the current WTOV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio), which had ceased operation because of poor viewership. Renamed WYAH-TV (known today as independent station WGNT), the station began broadcasting Christian programming to the Hampton Roads area on October 1, 1961.

In 1962, the station suffered financially and almost closed. It had a total operating budget of $700 per month. To keep the station on the air, WYAH produced a special telethon edition of the show. For the telethon, Robertson set a goal of 700 members each contributing $10 per month (), which was enough to support the station. Robertson referred to these members as the &quot;700 Club&quot; and the name stuck. The telethon was successful and is still held annually.

After the telethon in 1966, &quot;The 700 Club&quot; continued as a nightly, two-hour Christian variety program of music, preaching, group prayer, Bible study, and interview segments. The music was hymns, instrumental pieces, southern gospel music, and urban gospel music.

The first permanent host of the program was Jim Bakker, who, along with his then-wife Tammy Faye Bakker, also hosted a children&#x27;s show on WYAH called &quot;Come On Over&quot; (later retitled &quot;Jim and Tammy&quot;). The couple left CBN in 1972; reportedly, Jim Bakker was fired by Pat Robertson over philosophical differences. The Bakkers then moved on to help launch the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) before starting their own television ministry and signature show, &quot;The PTL Club&quot;. After the Bakkers left, some staffers at the station reportedly responded by destroying the Bakkers&#x27; sets and puppets. Pat Robertson took over as host and evolved his &quot;700 Club&quot; by cutting back on music and preaching and heading toward the talk show format developed by Bakker. Robertson transformed the &quot;700 Club&quot; from a nightly religious-themed telethon to a Christian talk show.

&quot;The 700 Club&quot; originally aired only on WYAH-TV and other CBN-owned stations in Atlanta (WANX-TV) and Dallas (KXTX-TV), and later Boston (WXNE-TV). The program entered national syndication in 1974, as CBN purchased airtime on stations such as WPIX in New York City, KTLA in Los Angeles, WPHL-TV in Philadelphia, and WDCA in Washington, D.C., among others. The roster of stations carrying the program grew to over 100 markets by 1976. In some markets, the show aired on multiple stations, choosing between either the full 90-minute version or an edited 60-minute version. In 1977, &quot;The 700 Club&quot; received additional exposure nationally on the newly launched CBN Cable Network where, like CBN&#x27;s broadcast outlets, it aired three times daily. 

In 1979, &quot;The 700 Club&quot; moved its studios from WYAH&#x27;s facilities in Portsmouth into CBN&#x27;s then-new campus in neighboring Virginia Beach, from where the program continues to originate. During the 1980s, the show evolved into more of a format resembling a magazine show like Group W&#x27;s &quot;PM Magazine&quot;, with news/opinion and lifestyle segments interspersed with interviews. In some markets, &quot;The 700 Club&quot; aired during the morning hours, competing head-to-head with the major network &quot;breakfast television&quot; programs such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. 

After CBN sold its group of terrestrial stations later in the decade, &quot;The 700 Club&quot; continued to air on CBN Cable as well as many commercial secular stations and Christian stations nationally. CBN was re-branded as The Family Channel in 1988. The Family Channel was packaged as part of a sale of International Family Entertainment to News Corporation and television producer Haim Saban in 1998. The channel was renamed Fox Family Channel, but only three years later Fox Family was sold to The Walt Disney Company and was subsequently re-branded ABC Family. Disney later rebranded ABC Family as Freeform on January 12, 2016; Freeform was later reunited with many of its former corporate siblings from News Corporation in 2019. , &quot;The 700 Club&quot; airs on Freeform three times daily, part of a contractual obligation originally made as part of the Family Channel&#x27;s sale to News Corporation. As of 2009, the first airing of the show in the morning (only) has been preceded by a half-hour show called &quot;700 Club Interactive&quot;, which utilizes Internet user-generated videos and comments by viewers of the show. Longtime host Pat Robertson announced his retirement from &quot;The 700 Club&quot; on October 1, 2021.

== Political advocacy ==
Between 1978 and 1980, discussions on current political issues became a part of the program, and news segments were added in the first 20 minutes of the show. &quot;The 700 Club&quot; strongly supports Israel, especially in its conflicts with the Palestinians and the United Nations.

== Criticism ==

As a commentator and minister on &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, Robertson made many controversial statements attracting criticism.

On March 23, 1995, Pat Robertson led a television program in which he attacked Hinduism, calling it &quot;demonic&quot;. He has also referred to Islam as &quot;Satanic&quot;. Robertson has denounced views of feminism, activism regarding homosexuality, abortion, and liberal college professors. Critics claim Robertson had business dealings in Africa with former presidents Charles Taylor of Liberia and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire who both had been internationally denounced for claims of human rights violations. Robertson was criticized worldwide for his call for Hugo Chávez&#x27;s assassination and for his remarks concerning Ariel Sharon&#x27;s ill-health as an act of God.

Former &quot;700 Club&quot; co-host Danuta Rylko Soderman later criticized Robertson for having no room on the show for profiling people with progressive illness, who were overweight, had facial blemishes, used wheelchairs, crutches, were blind or had blindness, no disabilities that could not be healed as Robertson viewed people with such problems as &quot;failures of the faith&quot; and that &quot;Robertson offers the Reader&#x27;s Digest version of answers to difficult and demanding religious, social, financial, marital, political, sexual and moral concepts.&quot; She also accused the show of faking a piece that had Robertson walking into a Contras camp in the Nicaraguan jungle during the Nicaraguan Civil War, claiming that the camp was actually a &quot;prop&quot; built by an airfield specifically for Robertson&#x27;s visit.

The week of September 11, 2001, Robertson discussed the terror attacks with Jerry Falwell, who said that &quot;the ACLU has to take a lot of blame for this&quot; in addition to &quot;the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays, and the lesbians [who have] helped [the terror attacks of September 11th] happen&quot;. Robertson replied, &quot;I totally concur&quot;. Both evangelists were seriously criticized by President George W. Bush for their commentary, for which Falwell later issued an apology.

In October 2003, while interviewing State Department critic Joel Mowbray about his book &quot;Dangerous Diplomacy&quot;, Robertson appeared to suggest that destroying the Harry S Truman Building with a nuclear bomb would enhance United States security by eliminating a nest of liberal traitors who secretly yearn for Islamic world domination. After officials condemned his remarks, Robertson aired a &quot;clarifying&quot; segment which he described as &quot;issu[ing] a correction to the State Department&quot; in which he reiterated his previous comments.

On November 9, 2009, Robertson said that Islam is &quot;a violent political system bent on the overthrow of the governments of the world and world domination&quot;. He went on to elaborate that &quot;you&#x27;re dealing with not a religion, you&#x27;re dealing with a political system, and I think we should treat it as such, and treat its adherents as such as we would members of the communist party, members of some fascist group&quot;.

Robertson&#x27;s response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake also drew worldwide controversy and was met with international condemnation. Robertson claimed that Haiti&#x27;s founders had sworn a &quot;pact to the Devil&quot; in order to liberate themselves from the French slave owners and indirectly attributed the earthquake to the consequences of the Haitian people being &quot;cursed&quot; for doing so. CBN later issued a statement saying that Robertson&#x27;s comments &quot;were based on the widely-discussed 1791 slave rebellion led by Dutty Boukman at Bois Caiman, where the slaves allegedly made a famous pact with the devil in exchange for victory over the French&quot;. Various figures in mainline and evangelical Christianity have on occasion disavowed some of Robertson&#x27;s remarks.

<doc id="220872" wikidata="Q1145411" url="?curid=220872" title="Cry of Dolores">
<text>The Cry of Dolores () occurred in Dolores, Mexico, on 16 September 1810, when Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rang his church bell and gave the call to arms that triggered the Mexican War of Independence. The Cry of Dolores is most commonly known by the locals as &quot;El Grito de Independencia&quot; (The Independence Cry).

Every year on the of Independence Day, the president of Mexico re-enacts the cry from the balcony of the National Palace in Mexico City while ringing the same bell Hidalgo used in 1810. During the patriotic speech, the president calls out the names of the fallen heroes who died during the War of Independence and ends the speech by shouting &quot;¡Viva México!&quot; three times, followed by the Mexican National Anthem.

==History==
In the 1810s, what would become Mexico was still New Spain, part of the Spanish crown. Following Napoleon&#x27;s overthrow of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy in 1808, Spain&#x27;s American possessions rose in rebellion, refusing to accept Napoleon&#x27;s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as king. In New Spain, the criollo leadership attempted to set a course of autonomy in support of the legitimate heir to the throne, Ferdinand VII, but the peninsular elite, fearing the loss of the colony, carried out a coup, also in the name of Ferdinand. Almost immediately, groups of creoles formed various plots around the viceroyalty, including in Querétaro, of which Father Hidalgo became a part. When the plot was discovered in early September 1810, some plotters decided to proceed with the uprising. Around 2:30 am on 16 September 1810, Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation. Flanked by Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama, he addressed the people in front of his church, urging them to revolt. His speech became known as the &quot;Cry of Dolores&quot;.

The liberated country adopted Mexico as its official name. Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain took a decade of war. Independence was achieved by the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire 11 years and 12 days later, on 28 September 1821. However, Hidalgo is credited as being the &quot;father of his country&quot;.

===Exact words and meaning===
Scholars have not been able to reach a consensus on the exact words Miguel Hidalgo said at the time. Michael Meyer has noted: &quot;The exact words of this most famous of all Mexican speeches are not known, or, rather, they are reproduced in almost as many variations as there are historians to reproduce them.&quot;

Meyer also argues that:
In contrast, William F. Cloud divides the sentiments above between Hidalgo and the crowd:
Many believe that Hidalgo&#x27;s Grito condemned the notion of monarchy and criticized the current social order in detail. However, his opposition targeted Spain and its viceroy in Mexico: that is, not against the monarchy in general but against &quot;bad government&quot;. The Grito also emphasized loyalty to the Catholic religion, a sentiment with which both Mexican-born &quot;Criollos&quot; and &quot;Peninsulares&quot; (native Spaniards) could sympathize. However, the strong anti-Spanish cry of &quot;Death to Gachupines&quot; (Gachupines being a slur given to Peninsulares) would have shocked Mexico&#x27;s elites.

==National festivities==
16 September was first celebrated in 1812 in Huichapan, Hidalgo. It was given the status of a national holiday in the Constitution of Apatzingán, ratified by the conventions of 1822 and 1824, and first celebrated nationally in 1825.

The Cry of Dolores has assumed an almost mythical status. Since the late 20th century, the event has come to symbolize Mexican independence and to initiate Independence Day ceremonies the following day (16 September). Independence Day in Mexico is a patriotic holiday marked by parades, concerts, patriotic programs, drum and bugle and marching band competitions, and special programs on national and local media outlets.

===Presidential celebration at Mexico City===


Every 15 September at around 11 p.m., the president of Mexico stands on the balcony of the National Palace in Mexico City and rings the same bell Hidalgo rang in 1810, which was moved to the National Palace. The president then recites a shout of patriotism (a Grito Mexicano) based upon the &quot;Grito de Dolores&quot;, with the names of the important heroes of the Mexican War of Independence who were there on that historic day. The Grito ends with the threefold shout of &quot;¡Viva México!&quot;

The Grito often differs slightly from year to year to reflect recent sentiments or a preference by the president for a shorter or longer shout. This is the version usually recited by the president of Mexico:
;Spanish
: ¡Mexicanos!
: ¡Vivan los héroes que nos dieron patria!
: ¡Viva Hidalgo!
: ¡Viva Morelos!
: ¡Viva Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez!
: ¡Viva Allende!
: ¡Vivan Aldama y Matamoros!
: ¡Viva la independencia nacional!
: ¡Viva México! ¡Viva México! ¡Viva México!

; English
: Mexicans!
: Long live the heroes who gave us our homeland!
: Long live Hidalgo!
: Long live Morelos!
: Long live Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez!
: Long live Allende!
: Long live Aldama and Matamoros!
: Long live the nation&#x27;s independence!
: Long live Mexico! Long live Mexico! Long live Mexico!
Beneath the balcony of the National Palace, there is a large crowd in the Plaza de la Constitución (also called the Zócalo) to hear the recitation. The event draws up to half a million spectators from all over Mexico and tourists worldwide. After the president recites each line beginning with &quot;¡Viva(n)!&quot;, the crowd responds by repeating, &quot;¡Viva(n)!&quot;

After the recitation, the president rings the bell and waves the flag of Mexico to the crowd&#x27;s applause.

This is followed by the playing of the Mexican national anthem by a military band from the Mexican Armed Forces, with the crowd singing along. The ceremonies conclude with a spectacular fireworks display at the Zócalo grounds.

On the morning of 16 September, or Independence Day, the national military parade in honor of the holiday starts in the Zócalo and its outskirts, passes the Hidalgo Memorial, and ends on the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City&#x27;s main boulevard, passing the &quot;Ángel de la Independencia&quot; memorial column and other places along the way.

===Recent exceptions===
The Grito is not always re-enacted at the National Palace; some years, it is performed in Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, where it originally happened. This is especially common in the final year of a President&#x27;s term.

President Felipe Calderón made an exception by re-enacting the Grito in Dolores Hidalgo as part of the bicentennial celebrations on 16 September 2010, even though he had already done so the night before from the National Palace balcony to launch the celebrations. As a result, in 2012, Calderón&#x27;s final year as president, he did not go to Dolores Hidalgo but gave the Grito from the National Palace balcony instead. President Enrique Peña Nieto did not perform the Grito in Dolores Hidalgo in his six years as president, becoming the fourth president to break the tradition.

Many presidents add their &quot;personal touch&quot; to the Grito, and this can be controversial. President Vicente Fox frequently took liberties with it, adding and removing items, addressing Mexicans of both genders, and wishing long life to &quot;our agreements&quot; in 2001. Peña Nieto gave &quot;vivas&quot; to victims of recent earthquakes in 2017.

During Peña Nieto&#x27;s presidency, the Grito became an occasion for political protest against him and his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). On 15 September 2016, a month after the president appeared humiliated by U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, thousands of citizens marched, yelled, and carried signs. They tried to enter the Zócalo during the Grito but were blocked by a wall of soldiers. News outlets within Mexico failed to acknowledge the protest. The event was well-attended, but opponents charged that the PRI brought &quot;acarreados&quot; (poor people or hand-picked party members) as a fake show of support.

The Grito was also disrupted in 2006 by a demonstration called the &quot;plantón&quot;. Crowds loyal to losing candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador protested alleged irregularities in the just-concluded general election, and the Grito could not be delivered at the Zócalo but was spoken at the National Palace. López Obrador won the presidency in 2018.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Grito to be done remotely.

===Celebrations by governors and municipal presidents===

Similar celebrations to the presidential one occur in cities and towns throughout Mexico, as well as Mexican embassies and consulates worldwide on 15 or 16 September. The chief executive, ambassador, or consul rings a bell and recites the traditional words, including the names of independence heroes and local s, and ends with the threefold shout of &quot;¡Viva México!&quot; The bell rings again, the Mexican flag is waved, and everyone sings the National Anthem, followed by fireworks. There are also celebrations in schools throughout Mexico, and in these cases, whenever the bell ringing is reenacted, the school or university head utters the traditional words. Celebrations also take place outside of Mexico, such as in U.S. states that have a large concentration of people of Mexican heritage who celebrate the holiday.

=== U.S. observances ===
As Mexico has historically been one of the largest sources of tourism to the region, the U.S. city of Las Vegas is known for hosting cultural events—including concerts and sporting events—that appeal to Mexicans and Hispanic Americans on and around 16 September. In the United States, National Hispanic Heritage Month also begins on 15 September; the date was chosen due to its proximity to the independence day of Mexico and other Latin American countries. 

Since the early 1990s, boxing cards with main events involving top Mexican fighters have been a fixture of Independence Day weekend in Las Vegas. While U.S.-hosted fights on the weekend date back as far as the 1970s, the tradition of hosting these fights in Las Vegas was first established by Julio César Chávez and his manager Don King, who fought annually during Independence Day week from 1991 to 1995. All but one of these bouts were held in Las Vegas, with his 1993 fight against Pernell Whitaker occurring at San Antonio&#x27;s Alamodome instead. The tradition was later taken up by other boxers of Mexican descent, such as Oscar De La Hoya and Canelo Álvarez. The tradition has also been extended to mixed martial arts, with UFC beginning to host a Las Vegas event on the weekend promoted as &quot;Noche UFC&quot; beginning with 2023&#x27;s UFC Fight Night: Grasso vs. Shevchenko 2 (with a main event featuring the promotion&#x27;s first women&#x27;s champion of Mexican descent, Alexa Grasso), and UFC 306 in 2024 (where all but one of the matches featured at least one fighter of Mexican or Mexican-American descent).

<text>Dolores Hidalgo (; in full, Dolores Hidalgo Cuna de la Independencia Nacional, ) is the name of a city and the surrounding municipality in the north-central part of the Mexican state of Guanajuato.

It is located at , at an elevation of about above sea level. In the census of 2005 the city had a population of 54,843, while the municipality had 134,641 inhabitants. The city lies directly in the center of the municipality, which is in area and includes numerous small outlying communities, the largest of which is Río Laja with a population of 2,211 (2005 census).

Dolores Hidalgo was named a &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; (Magic Town) in 2002

==History== 

The city was a small town known simply as Dolores when Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla uttered his famous cry for the independence of Mexico (the &quot;Grito de Dolores&quot;) there in the early hours of September 16, 1810, in front of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores parish church. After Mexico achieved independence, the town was renamed &quot;Dolores Hidalgo&quot; in his honor.

Today Dolores Hidalgo is known primarily for its ceramics industry, started by Father Hidalgo, which provides income to well over half the city&#x27;s population. The inexpensive and mass-produced output of the town is marketed throughout Latin America and the United States. The central square of the town, in front of Fr Hidalgo&#x27;s historic church, is a popular tourist spot.

A place of pilgrimage in Dolores Hidalgo for many fans of ranchera and popular music is the tomb of José Alfredo Jiménez, one of the country&#x27;s most beloved singers and songwriters, as well as one of the most prolific popular songwriters in the history of western music. He is buried in the town cemetery.

Footballer Adolfo &quot;El Bofo&quot; Bautista and USA Olympian Leonel Manzano were born here.

<text>Florence Cathedral (), formally the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flower ( ), is the cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Florence. Commenced in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and structurally completed by 1436 with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi, the basilica&#x27;s exterior is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink, bordered by white, and features an elaborate 19th-century Gothic Revival (west) façade by Emilio De Fabris.

The cathedral complex, in Piazza del Duomo, includes the Baptistery and Giotto&#x27;s Campanile. These three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major tourist attraction of Tuscany. The basilica is one of world&#x27;s largest churches and its dome is still the largest masonry dome ever constructed. The cathedral is the mother church of the Archdiocese of Florence, whose archbishop is Gherardo Gambelli.

==History==

Santa Maria del Fiore was built on the site of Florence&#x27;s second cathedral dedicated to Saint Reparata; the first was the Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze, the first building of which was consecrated as a church in 393 by St. Ambrose of Milan. The ancient structure, founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs, was crumbling with age, according to the 14th-century &quot;Nuova Cronica&quot; of Giovanni Villani, and was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city. Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period, such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed.

The city council approved Arnolfo di Cambio&#x27;s design for the new church in 1294. Di Cambio was also architect of the church of Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio. He designed three wide naves ending under the octagonal dome, with the middle nave covering the area of Santa Reparata. The first stone was laid on 9 September 1296, by Cardinal Valeriana, the first papal legate ever sent to Florence. The building of this vast project was to last 140 years; Arnolfo&#x27;s plan for the eastern end, although maintained in concept, was greatly expanded in size.

After Arnolfo died in 1302, work on the cathedral slowed for almost 50 years. When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata, the project gained a new impetus. In 1331, the Arte della Lana, the guild of wool merchants, took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work. Assisted by Andrea Pisano, Giotto continued di Cambio&#x27;s design. His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile. When Giotto died on 8 January 1337, Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348.
In 1349, action resumed on the cathedral under a series of architects, starting with Francesco Talenti, who finished the campanile and enlarged the overall project to include the apse and the side chapels. In 1359, Talenti was succeeded by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini (1360–1369) who divided the centre nave in four square bays. Other architects were Alberto Arnoldi, Giovanni d&#x27;Ambrogio, Neri di Fioravanti and Andrea Orcagna. By 1375, the old church Santa Reparata was pulled down. The nave was finished by 1380, and only the dome remained incomplete until 1436.

On 19 August 1418, the Arte della Lana announced an architectural design competition for erecting Neri&#x27;s dome. The two main competitors were two master goldsmiths, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi, the latter of whom was supported by Cosimo de Medici. Ghiberti had been the winner of a competition for a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery in 1401 and lifelong competition between the two remained sharp. Brunelleschi won and received the commission.

Ghiberti, appointed coadjutor, drew a salary equal to Brunelleschi&#x27;s and, though neither was awarded the announced prize of 200 florins, was promised equal credit, although he spent most of his time on other projects. When Brunelleschi became ill, or feigned illness, the project was briefly in the hands of Ghiberti. But Ghiberti soon had to admit that the whole project was beyond him. In 1423, Brunelleschi was back in charge and took over sole responsibility.

Erection of the dome had begun in 1420 and was finished in 1436. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV on 25 March 1436, the first day of the year according to the Florentine calendar. It was the first &#x27;octagonal&#x27; dome in history to be built without a temporary wooden supporting frame. During the consecration in 1436, Guillaume Dufay&#x27;s motet &quot;Nuper rosarum flores&quot; was performed.

The decoration of the exterior of the cathedral, begun in the 14th century, was left unfinished after the initial works done by Arnolfo di Cambio, which led Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici to initiate a design competition for the façade between 1490 and 1491. The competition went ultimately nowhere, and the façade was not completed until 1887, when the polychrome marble façade was completed with the design of Emilio De Fabris. The floor of the church was relaid in marble tiles in the 16th century.

The exterior walls are faced in alternate vertical and horizontal bands of polychrome marble from Carrara (white), Prato (green), Siena (red), Lavenza and a few other places. These marble bands had to repeat the already existing bands on the walls of the earlier adjacent baptistery the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto&#x27;s Bell Tower. There are two side doors: the &quot;Doors of the Canonici&quot; (south side) and the &quot;Door of the Mandorla&quot; (north side) with sculptures by Nanni di Banco, Donatello, and Jacopo della Quercia. The six side windows, notable for their delicate tracery and ornaments, are separated by pilasters. Only the four windows closest to the transept admit light; the other two are merely ornamental. The clerestory windows are round, a common feature in Italian Gothic.

==Exterior==

===Plan and structure===

The cathedral of Florence is built as a basilica, having a wide central nave of four square bays, with an aisle on either side. The chancel and transepts are of identical polygonal plan, separated by two smaller polygonal chapels. The whole plan forms a Latin cross. The nave and aisles are separated by wide pointed Gothic arches resting on composite piers.

The dimensions of the building are enormous: building area , length , width , width at the crossing . The height of the arches in the aisles is . The height of the dome is . It has the fifth tallest dome in the world.

===Planned sculpture for the exterior===
The Overseers of the Office of Works of Florence Cathedral the Arte della Lana, had plans to commission a series of twelve large Old Testament sculptures for the buttresses of the cathedral. Donatello, then in his early twenties, was commissioned to carve a statue of David in 1408, to top one of the buttresses of Florence Cathedral, though it was never placed there. Nanni di Banco was commissioned to carve a marble statue of Isaiah, at the same scale, in the same year. One of the statues was lifted into place in 1409, but was found to be too small to be easily visible from the ground and was taken down; both statues then languished in the workshop of the &quot;opera&quot; for several years. In 1410 Donatello made the first of the statues, a figure of Joshua in terracotta. In 1409–1411 Donatello made a statue of &quot;Saint John the Evangelist&quot; which until 1588 was in a niche of the old cathedral façade. Between 1415 and 1426, Donatello created five statues for the campanile of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, also known as the Duomo. These works are the &quot;Beardless Prophet&quot;; &quot;Bearded Prophet&quot; (both from 1415); the &quot;Sacrifice of Isaac&quot; (1421); &quot;Habbakuk&quot; (1423–25); and &quot;Jeremiah&quot; (1423–26); which follow the classical models for orators and are characterized by strong portrait details. A figure of Hercules, also in terracotta, was commissioned from the Florentine sculptor Agostino di Duccio in 1463 and was made perhaps under Donatello&#x27;s direction. A statue of David by Michelangelo was completed 1501–1504 although it could not be placed on the buttress because of its six-ton weight. In 2010 a fiberglass replica of &quot;David&quot; was placed for one day on the Florence cathedral.
===Dome===
After a hundred years of construction and by the beginning of the 15th century, the structure was still missing its dome. The basic features of the dome had been designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1296. His brick model, high, long, was standing in a side aisle of the unfinished building, and had long been sacrosanct. It called for an octagonal dome higher and wider than any that had ever been built, with no external buttresses to keep it from spreading and falling under its own weight.
The commitment to reject traditional Gothic buttresses had been made when Neri di Fioravanti&#x27;s model was chosen over a competing one by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini. That architectural choice, in 1367, was one of the first events of the Italian Renaissance, marking a break with the Medieval Gothic style and a return to the classic Mediterranean dome. Italian architects regarded Gothic flying buttresses as ugly makeshifts. Furthermore, the use of buttresses was forbidden in Florence, as the style was favored by central Italy&#x27;s traditional enemies to the north. Neri&#x27;s model depicted a massive inner dome, open at the top to admit light, like Rome&#x27;s Pantheon, partly supported by the inner dome, but enclosed in a thinner outer shell, to keep out the weather. It was to stand on an unbuttressed octagonal drum. Neri&#x27;s dome would need an internal defense against spreading (hoop stress), but none had yet been designed.

The building of such a masonry dome posed many technical problems. Brunelleschi looked to the great dome of the Pantheon in Rome for solutions. The dome of the Pantheon is a single shell of concrete, the formula for which had long since been forgotten. The Pantheon had employed structural centring to support the concrete dome while it cured. This could not be the solution in the case of a dome this size and would put the church out of use. For the height and breadth of the dome designed by Neri, starting above the floor and spanning , there was not enough timber in Tuscany to build the scaffolding and forms. Brunelleschi chose to follow such design and employed a double shell, made of sandstone and marble. Brunelleschi would have to build the dome out of brick, due to its light weight compared to stone and being easier to form, and with nothing under it during construction. To illustrate his proposed structural plan, he constructed a wooden and brick model with the help of Donatello and Nanni di Banco, a model which is still displayed in the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo. The model served as a guide for the craftsmen, but was intentionally incomplete, so as to ensure Brunelleschi&#x27;s control over the construction.
Brunelleschi&#x27;s solutions were ingenious. The spreading problem was solved by a set of four internal horizontal stone and iron chains, serving as barrel hoops, embedded within the inner dome: one at the top, one at the bottom, with the remaining two evenly spaced between them. A fifth chain, made of wood, was placed between the first and second of the stone chains. Since the dome was octagonal rather than round, a simple chain, squeezing the dome like a barrel hoop, would have put all its pressure on the eight corners of the dome. The chains needed to be rigid octagons, stiff enough to hold their shape, so as not to deform the dome as they held it together.

Each of Brunelleschi&#x27;s stone chains was built like an octagonal railroad track with parallel rails and cross ties, all made of sandstone beams in diameter and no more than long. The rails were connected end-to-end with lead-glazed iron splices. The cross ties and rails were notched together and then covered with the bricks and mortar of the inner dome. The cross ties of the bottom chain can be seen protruding from the drum at the base of the dome. The others are hidden. Each stone chain was supposed to be reinforced with a standard iron chain made of interlocking links, but a magnetic survey conducted in the 1970s failed to detect any evidence of iron chains, which if they exist are deeply embedded in the thick masonry walls. Brunelleschi also included vertical &quot;ribs&quot; set on the corners of the octagon, curving towards the center point. The ribs, deep, are supported by 16 concealed ribs radiating from center. The ribs had slits to take beams that supported platforms, thus allowing the work to progress upward without the need for scaffolding.

A circular masonry dome can be built without supports, called centering, because each course of bricks is a horizontal arch that resists compression. In Florence, the octagonal inner dome was thick enough for an imaginary circle to be embedded in it at each level, a feature that would hold the dome up eventually, but could not hold the bricks in place while the mortar was still wet. Brunelleschi used a herringbone brick pattern to transfer the weight of the freshly laid bricks to the nearest vertical ribs of the non-circular dome.
The outer dome was not thick enough to contain embedded horizontal circles, being only thick at the base and thick at the top. To create such circles, Brunelleschi thickened the outer dome at the inside of its corners at nine different elevations, creating nine masonry rings, which can be observed today from the space between the two domes. To counteract hoop stress, the outer dome relies entirely on its attachment to the inner dome and has no embedded chains.

A modern understanding of physical laws and the mathematical tools for calculating stresses were centuries in the future. Brunelleschi, like all cathedral builders, had to rely on intuition and whatever he could learn from the large scale models he built. To lift 37,000 tons of material, including over 4 million bricks, he invented hoisting machines and lewissons for hoisting large stones. These specially designed machines and his structural innovations were Brunelleschi&#x27;s chief contribution to architecture. Although he was executing an aesthetic plan made half a century earlier, it is his name, rather than Neri&#x27;s, that is commonly associated with the dome.

Brunelleschi&#x27;s ability to crown the dome with a lantern was questioned and he had to undergo another competition, even though there had been evidence that Brunelleschi had been working on a design for a lantern for the upper part of the dome. The evidence is shown in the curvature, which was made steeper than the original model. He was declared the winner over his competitors Lorenzo Ghiberti and Antonio Ciaccheri. His design (now on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo) was for an octagonal lantern with eight radiating buttresses and eight high arched windows. Construction of the lantern was begun a few months before his death in 1446. Then, for 15 years, little progress was possible, due to alterations by several architects. The lantern was finally completed by Brunelleschi&#x27;s friend Michelozzo in 1461. The conical roof was crowned with a gilt copper ball and cross, containing holy relics, by Verrocchio in 1469. This brings the total height of the dome and lantern to . This copper ball was struck by lightning on 17 July 1600 and fell down. It was replaced by an even larger one two years later.
The commission for this gilt copper ball [atop the lantern] went to the sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio, in whose workshop there was at this time a young apprentice named Leonardo da Vinci. Fascinated by Filippo&#x27;s [Brunelleschi&#x27;s] machines, which Verrocchio used to hoist the ball, Leonardo made a series of sketches of them and, as a result, is often given credit for their invention.

Leonardo might have also participated in the design of the bronze ball, as stated in the G manuscript of Paris &quot;Remember the way we soldered the ball of Santa Maria del Fiore&quot;.

The decorations of the drum gallery by Baccio d&#x27;Agnolo were never finished after being disapproved by no one less than Michelangelo.

A huge statue of Brunelleschi now sits outside the Palazzo dei Canonici in the Piazza del Duomo, looking thoughtfully up towards his greatest achievement, the dome that would forever dominate the panorama of Florence. It is still the largest masonry dome in the world.

The building of the cathedral had started in 1296 with the design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was completed in 1469 with the placing of Verrochio&#x27;s copper ball atop the lantern. But the façade was still unfinished and would remain so until the 19th century.

===Façade===
The original façade, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and usually attributed to Giotto, was actually begun twenty years after Giotto&#x27;s death. A mid-15th-century pen-and-ink drawing of this so-called Giotto&#x27;s façade is visible in the Codex Rustici, and in the drawing of Bernardino Poccetti in 1587, both on display in the Museum of the Opera del Duomo. This façade was the collective work of several artists, among them Andrea Orcagna and Taddeo Gaddi. This original façade was completed in only its lower portion and then left unfinished. It was dismantled in 1587–1588 by the Medici court architect Bernardo Buontalenti, ordered by Grand Duke Francesco I de&#x27; Medici, as it appeared totally outmoded in Renaissance times. Some of the original sculptures are on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo, behind the cathedral. Others are now in the Berlin Museum and in the Louvre.

The competition for a new façade turned into a huge corruption scandal. The wooden model for the façade of Buontalenti is on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo. A few new designs had been proposed in later years, but the models (of Giovanni Antonio Dosio, Giovanni de&#x27; Medici with Alessandro Pieroni and Giambologna) were not accepted. The façade was then left bare until the 19th century.

In 1864, a competition held to design a new façade was won by Emilio De Fabris (1808–1883) in 1871. Work began in 1876 and was completed in 1887. This neo-gothic façade in white, green and red marble forms a harmonious entity with the cathedral, Giotto&#x27;s bell tower and the Baptistery.

==Main portal==
The three huge bronze doors date from 1899 to 1903. They are adorned with scenes from the life of the Madonna. The mosaics in the lunettes above the doors were designed by Niccolò Barabino. They represent (from left to right): &quot;Charity among the founders of Florentine philanthropic institutions&quot;; &quot;Christ enthroned with Mary and John the Baptist&quot;; and &quot;Florentine artisans, merchants and humanists&quot;. The pediment above the central portal contains a half-relief by Tito Sarrocchi of &quot;Mary enthroned holding a flowered scepter&quot;. Giuseppe Cassioli sculpted the right-hand door.

On top of the façade is a series of niches with the twelve Apostles with, in the middle, the Madonna with Child. Between the rose window and the tympanum, there is a gallery with busts of great Florentine artists.

==Interior==




The Gothic interior is vast and gives an empty impression. The relative bareness of the church corresponds with the austerity of religious life, as preached by Girolamo Savonarola.

Many decorations in the church have been lost in the course of time, or have been transferred to the Museum Opera del Duomo, such as the magnificent cantorial pulpits (the singing galleries for the choristers) of Luca della Robbia and Donatello.

As this cathedral was built with funds from the public, some important works of art in this church honour illustrious men and military leaders of Florence:

Lorenzo Ghiberti had a large artistic impact on the cathedral. Ghiberti worked with Filippo Brunelleschi on the cathedral for eighteen years and had a large number of projects on almost the whole east end. Some of his works were the stained glass designs, the bronze shrine of Saint Zenobius and marble revetments on the outside of the cathedral.

*&quot;Dante Before the City of Florence&quot; by Domenico di Michelino (1465). This painting is especially interesting because it shows us, apart from scenes of the Divine Comedy, a view on Florence in 1465, a Florence such as Dante himself could not have seen in his time.
*&quot;Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood&quot; by Paolo Uccello (1436). This almost monochrome fresco, transferred to canvas in the 19th century, is painted in &quot;terra verde&quot;, a color closest to the patina of bronze.
*&quot;Equestrian statue of Niccolò da Tolentino&quot; by Andrea del Castagno (1456). This fresco, transferred on canvas in the 19th century, in the same style as the previous one, is painted in a color resembling marble. However, it is more richly decorated and gives more the impression of movement. Both frescoes portray the condottieri as heroic figures riding triumphantly. Both painters had problems when applying in painting the new rules of perspective to foreshortening: they used two unifying points, one for the horse and one for the pedestal, instead a single unifying point.
*Busts of Giotto (by Benedetto da Maiano), Brunelleschi (by Buggiano – 1447), Marsilio Ficino, and Antonio Squarcialupi (a most famous organist). These busts all date from the 15th and the 16th centuries.

Above the main door is the colossal clock face with fresco portraits of four Prophets or Evangelists by Paolo Uccello (1443). This one-handed liturgical clock shows the 24 hours of the &quot;hora italica&quot; (Italian time), a period of time ending with sunset at 24 hours. This timetable was used until the 18th century. This is one of the few clocks from that time that still exist and are in working order.

The church is particularly notable for its 44 stained glass windows, the largest undertaking of this kind in Italy in the 14th and 15th century. The windows in the aisles and in the transept depict saints from the Old and the New Testament, while the circular windows in the drum of the dome or above the entrance depict Christ and Mary. They are the work of the greatest Florentine artists of their times, such as Donatello, Lorenzo Ghiberti, Paolo Uccello and Andrea del Castagno.

&quot;Christ crowning Mary as Queen&quot;, the stained-glass circular window above the clock, with a rich range of coloring, was designed by Gaddo Gaddi in the early 14th century.

Donatello designed the stained-glass window (&quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot;) in the drum of the dome (the only one that can be seen from the nave).

The funeral monument of Antonio d&#x27;Orso (1323), bishop of Florence, was made by Tino da Camaino, the most important funeral sculptor of his time.

The monumental crucifix, behind the Bishop&#x27;s Chair at the high altar, is by Benedetto da Maiano (1495–1497). The choir enclosure is the work of the famous Bartolommeo Bandinelli. The ten-paneled bronze doors of the sacristy were made by Luca della Robbia, who has also two glazed terracotta works inside the sacristy: &quot;Angel with Candlestick&quot; and &quot;Resurrection of Christ&quot;.

In the back of the middle of the three apses is the altar of Saint Zanobius, first bishop of Florence. Its silver shrine, a masterpiece of Ghiberti, contains the urn with his relics. The central compartment shows us one of his miracles, the reviving of a dead child. Above this shrine is the painting &quot;Last Supper&quot; by the lesser-known Giovanni Balducci. There was also a glass-paste mosaic panel &quot;The Bust of Saint Zanobius&quot; by the 16th-century miniaturist Monte di Giovanni, but it is now on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo.

Many decorations date from the 16th-century patronage of the Grand Dukes, such as the pavement in colored marble, attributed to Baccio d&#x27;Agnolo and Francesco da Sangallo (1520–26). Some pieces of marble from the façade were used, topside down, in the flooring (as was shown by the restoration of the floor after the 1966 flooding).

The ceiling of the dome is decorated with a representation of &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;. Originally left whitewashed following its completion it was the Grand Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici who decided to have the ceiling of the dome painted. This enormous work, 3,600 metres² (38 750 ft²) of painted surface, was started in 1572 by Giorgio Vasari and would not be completed until 1579. The upper portion, near the lantern, representing &quot;The 24 Elders of Apocalypse&quot; was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574. Federico Zuccari with the assistance of Bartolomeo Carducci, Domenico Passignano and Stefano Pieri finished the other portions: (from top to bottom) &quot;Choirs of Angels&quot;; &quot;Christ, Mary and Saints&quot;; &quot;Virtues, Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes&quot;; and at the bottom of the cupola: &quot;Capital Sins and Hell&quot;. These frescoes are considered Zuccari&#x27;s greatest work. But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques. Vasari had used &quot;true fresco&quot;, while Zuccari had painted &quot;in secco&quot;. During the restoration work, which ended in 1995, the entire pictorial cycle of &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue. All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system.

==Astronomical observations==

In 1475 the Italian astronomer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli (who was also a mathematical tutor of Brunelleschi) pierced a hole in the dome at above the pavement to create a meridian line. The height precluded the installation of a complete meridian line on the floor of the cathedral, but allowed a short section of approximately to run between the main altar and the north wall of the transept. This allows for observation for around 35 days either side of the summer solstice.

Due to settlement in the building and also movements due to the outside temperature changes, the meridian line had limited astronomical value and fell into disuse until it was restored in 1755 by Leonardo Ximenes.

The meridian line was covered over by the &quot;fabbricieri&quot; in 1894 and unveiled again in 1997. A yearly re-enacement of the observation takes place on 21 June each year at 12.00 UT.

==Crypt==

The cathedral underwent difficult excavations between 1965 and 1974. The archaeological history of this huge area was reconstructed through the work of Franklin Toker: remains of Roman houses, an early Christian pavement, ruins of the former cathedral of Santa Reparata and successive enlargements of this church. Close to the entrance, in the part of the crypt open to the public, is the tomb of Brunelleschi. While its location is prominent, the actual tomb is simple and humble. That the architect was permitted such a prestigious burial place is proof of the high esteem he was held in by the Florentines.

*Conrad II of Italy

*Filippo Brunelleschi
*Giotto di Bondone

*Pope Stephen IX
*John Hawkwood

==Cracking of the dome==

The unreinforced masonry that Brunelleschi used to construct the dome is weak in tension which leads to cracking when tensile stresses exceed the limited masonry tensile strength. The material is especially susceptible to damage from seismic loading due to its heterogeneity and many surfaces between different materials (stones to mortar connection).

Cracking of the dome was observed even before its construction was completed. It is possible that the first cracks were caused by a strong earthquake in 1453.

The first written evidence about the presence of cracks appears in a report by Gherardo Silvani report dated 18 September 1639 which refers to &quot;peli&quot; (&quot;hairs&quot;). In 1694 Giambattista Nelli and Vincenzo Viviani surveyed the cracks with Nelli recording that there were two major cracks with a maximum width of . They believed that the cracks were caused by the weight of the dome, and the resulting horizontal thrusts on the pillars. A commission, headed by Vincenzo Viviani, carried out investigations in 1695 and came to the conclusion that the cracking was due to the dead weight of the buildings. It was proposed that the dome be strengthened by installing four large iron belts; three on the outside of the dome between the bulging area of the dome and the circular windows, while the fourth would be installed internally in the second walkway between the two shells. This was similar to what had been done on the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome. After a long debate, a decision was made to leave the dome as it was.

The first most complete survey of the cracks was published in 1757 by the Jesuit Leonardo Ximenes (1716–1786). In his document he described 13 different crack typologies. In 1934, Pier Luigi Nervi, who was head of a special commission established by the Opera del Duomo to study the cracking, observed that the cracks opened and closed with the seasons. In the winter, the dome&#x27;s stone and bricks would contract causing the cracks to widen, while over the summer the materials would expand and the cracks would close up. While modern buildings by design incorporate expansion joints, the cathedral&#x27;s dome does not include any and so subsequently developed its own expansion joints in the form of these cracks which allowed the structure to &quot;breathe&quot;. To date they have not caused any catastrophic damage to the dome.

In 1955 the Opera del Duomo installed 22 mechanical deformometers, which were read four times a year to record the variations in the width of the major cracks in the inner dome. At the same time the dome&#x27;s internal and external temperatures were also recorded. This remained in service until 2009.

In 1975 a commission was appointed by the Italian government to safeguard the dome. In 1978 a government culture agency decided to restore the frescoes. Brunelleschi left forty eight holes in the base of the dome. They are open on the inside and covered by the outer skin of the dome. It has long been assumed that the holes simply served as mounts for the scaffold used when frescoes were painted on the inside of the dome. While the holes had been able to support the scaffolding used for the creation of the frescos on the interior of the dome they were not strong enough for the network of modern metal scaffolding necessary to provide access for the restoration work undertaken on the frescos between 1979 and 1995. To strengthen the scaffolding, the private company contracted to build scaffolding for the work was allowed in 1982 to fill the holes with concrete so that steel beams could be anchored in them.

In 1985 local architect Lando Bartoli noticed that additional cracks were forming around the sealed holes. It was theorized at the time that in summer the four major masses separated by the &quot;A&quot; cracks expanded into the fissures, but now, at the base of the dome, the masses come up against the unyielding concrete that now fills the 48 holes acts as a fulcrum which causes the energy that was once dissipated with the closing of the fissures and into the holes to be transferred into the upper areas of the dome.
However analysis by Andrea Chiarugi, Michele Fanelli and Giuseppetti (published in 1983) found that the principal source of the cracks was a dead-weight effect due to the geometry of the dome, its weight (estimated to be 25,000 tons) and the insufficient resistance of the ring beam, while thermal variations, has caused fatigue loading and thus expanding of the structure.
This is a well-known collapse mechanism typical of domed structures: a lowering of the top of the structure under its own weight with significant horizontal thrusts on the bearing elements.

In 1985 a commission established by the Italian Ministry of Cultural and Monumental Heritage accepted this theory. The debate about the filling of the scaffolding holes was finally settled in 1987 when it was demonstrated that closing the 48 holes had had no impact on the expansion and contraction of the dome. A survey completed in 1984 counted a total of 493 cracks of various sizes, sorted into categories identified by the letters &quot;A&quot; through &quot;D&quot;. These are as follows:
*Type A. These are sub-vertical major cracks that start from the ring beam and continue upwards for approximately two-thirds of the height of the dome; they pass through both the internal and external layer of the even webs and their range in thickness from to (webs 4 and 6) and to (webs 2 and 8). The dome has eight webs numbered counter clockwise from 1, which faces the main nave of the cathedral. These effectively divide the dome into quarters and never completely close in summer. There is a theory that the plaster used to patch the cracks over the years and crumbling building materials have jammed the fissures.
*Type B. These sub-vertical minor cracks are located near the circular windows.
*Type C. These are sub-vertical minor cracks that are present around the eight edges of the dome.
*Type D. These are four sub-vertical minor cracks in the internal part of the odd webs. They do not pass through the width of the dome.
All have formed in a symmetrical pattern.

The development of the Type &quot;A&quot; cracks means that the dome now permanently behaves as four drifting half-arches linked below the upper oculus. The abutments of these half-arches are constituted by the pillars, the chapels and the nave of the church. The differences in the cracking patterns between even and odd webs is believed to be due to variations in the stiffness of the supporting ring beam structure under the dome as it is supported by four heavy pillars which line up with the even webs while the odd webs are located over four arches which connect the pillars.

In 1987 a second, more comprehensive digital system (which automatically collects data every six hours) was installed by ISMES (in cooperation with the &quot;Soprintendenza&quot;, the local branch of the Ministry of Culture, which is responsible for the conservation of all historical monuments in Florence). It consists of 166 instruments, among which are 60 thermometers measuring the masonry and air temperature at various locations, 72 inductive type displacement transducers (deformometers) at various levels on the main cracks of the inner and outer domes; eight plumb-lines at the centre of each web, which measure the relative displacements between pillars and tambour; eight livellometers and two piezometers, one near the web 4 and the other below the nave which register the variation of the underground water level. A linear regression analysis of the recorded data has shown that the major cracks are widening by approximately per century. Another source quotes a movement of 5.5mm.

Using software that had been used to model the structures of large dams, a computer model of the dome was developed in 1980 in a collaboration between Italian National Agency for Electric Power and Structural and Hydraulic Research Centre (CRIS) by a group of researchers led by Michele Fanelli and Gabriella Giuseppetti in cooperation with the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Florence, under the supervision of Andrea Chiarugi. Because of limited computational resources and for reasons of symmetry, only a quarter of the dome was modelled. The resulting finite elements analysis confirmed that the main cracks were essentially being created by self-weight of the dome. Since then series of numerical models of increasing complexity have been developed. To assist in monitoring of the dome an extensive photogrammetric and topographical survey of the entire dome was commissioned in 1992 by the &quot;Soprintendenza&quot;. The results of this survey were then used to further develop the finite elements model of the dome.

<text>The Big Mac Index is a price index published since 1986 by &quot;The Economist&quot; as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and providing a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It &quot;seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible.&quot; The index compares the relative price worldwide to purchase the Big Mac, a hamburger sold at McDonald&#x27;s restaurants.

== Overview ==

The Big Mac index was introduced in &quot;The Economist&quot; in September 1986 by Pam Woodall as a semi-humorous illustration of PPP and has been published by that paper annually since then. Although the Big Mac Index was not intended to be a legitimate tool for exchange rate evaluation, it is now globally recognised and featured in many academic textbooks and reports. The index also gave rise to the word &quot;burgernomics.&quot;

The theory underpinning the Big Mac index stems from the concept of PPP, which states that the exchange rate between two currencies should equalize the prices charged for an identical basket of goods. However, in reality, sourcing an identical basket of goods in every country provides a complex challenge. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), over &quot;3,000 consumer goods and services, 30 occupations in government, 200 types of equipment goods and about 15 construction projects&quot; are included in the current PPP calculations. In an effort to simplify this important economic concept, The Economist proposed that a single McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac could be used instead of a basket of goods. A McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac was chosen because of the prevalence of the fast food chain worldwide, and because the sandwich remains largely the same across all countries. Although a single sandwich may seem overly simplistic for PPP theory, the price of a Big Mac is derived from the culmination of &quot;many local economic factors, such as the price of the ingredients, local wages, or how much it costs to put up billboards and buy TV ads&quot;. As a result, the Big Mac index provides a &quot;reasonable measure of real-world purchasing power&quot;.

The purpose of the Big Mac index is to calculate an implied exchange rate between two currencies. In order to calculate the Big Mac index, the price of a Big Mac in a foreign country (in the foreign country&#x27;s currency) is divided by the price of Big Mac in a base country (in the base country&#x27;s currency). Typically, the base country used is the United States.

For example, using figures from July 2023:

# In Switzerland, a Big Mac costs 6.70 Swiss francs.
# In the U.S., a Big Mac costs US$5.58.
# The implied exchange rate is 1.20 francs per dollar, that is 6.70 francs/$5.58 = 1.20.

Consistent with PPP economic theory, the Big Mac index also provides a method to analyse a currency&#x27;s level of under/over-valuation against a base currency. In order to calculate whether a currency is under/over-valued, the implied exchange rate (as defined by the Big Mac index) must be compared to the actual exchange rate. If the implied exchange rate is greater than the actual exchange rate, then the analysed currency is overvalued against the base currency. If the implied exchange rate is less than the actual exchange rate, then the analysed currency is undervalued against the base currency.

For example, using figures for July 2023:

# The implied exchange rate according to the Big Mac index is 1.20 francs per dollar
# The actual exchange rate is 0.87 francs per dollar
# The Swiss franc is overvalued by 38.5% against the U.S. dollar, that is (1.20-0.87)/0.87 = 38.5%

== Variants ==
* &quot;The Economist&quot; sometimes produces variants on the theme. For example, in January 2004, it showed a &quot;Tall Latte index&quot; with the Big Mac replaced by a cup of Starbucks coffee.
* In 2007, an Australian bank tried a variation the Big Mac index, being an &quot;iPod index&quot;: since the iPod is manufactured at a single place, the value of iPods should be more consistent globally. However, this theory can be criticised for ignoring shipping costs, which will vary depending on how far the product is delivered from its &quot;single place&quot; of manufacture in China.
* Bloomberg L.P. introduced the Billy index where they convert local prices of IKEA&#x27;s Billy bookshelf into U.S. dollars and compare the prices.
* Gold-Mac-Index: The value of the purchasing power for 1 g of gold (Gold.de: calculation of the gold price average of the corresponding year), how many burgers one got for 1 g gold.
* A Swiss bank has expanded the idea of the Big Mac index to include the amount of time that an average local worker in a given country must work to earn enough to buy a Big Mac.
* In 2017, the comparison platform Versus did a version called The Chai Latte Global Index, comparing Starbucks Chai Latte prices worldwide, by first converting the local prices into U.S. dollars.
* Global personal finance comparison website, Finder.com, released a more comprehensive Starbucks Index in 2019, which analyzed coffee prices for a tall latte in 76 countries and autonomous regions around the world. The report included a Latte Line, which measured the correlation between the price of coffee and a country&#x27;s GDP.
* In 2022, Trusaic, a provider of equal pay compliance software, unveiled a new online tool called The Big Mac Pay Gap Index, which shows how much more a Big Mac would cost you, after adjusting the menu price of a Big Mac to reflect whatever pay gap you may face.

== Limitations ==
While economists widely cite the Big Mac index as a reasonable real-world measurement of purchasing power parity, the burger methodology has some limitations.

The Big Mac Index is limited by geographical coverage, due to the presence of the McDonald&#x27;s franchise. For example, in Africa McDonald&#x27;s is only present in Morocco, Egypt, South Africa and Mauritius (there has been a similar index created solely for Africa called the &quot;KFC Index&quot;: as the name suggests, instead of using a Big Mac, this index uses KFC&#x27;s Original 15-piece bucket to compile its data).

In many countries, eating at international fast-food chain restaurants such as McDonald&#x27;s is relatively expensive in comparison to eating at a local restaurant, and the demand for Big Macs is not as large in countries such as India as in the United States. Social status of eating at fast food restaurants such as McDonald&#x27;s in a local market, what proportion of sales might be to expatriates, local taxes, levels of competition, and import duties on selected items may not be representative of the country&#x27;s economy as a whole.

In addition, there is no theoretical reason why non-tradable goods and services such as property costs should be equal in different countries: a pound of American beef used in the Big Mac&#x27;s patties is not the same price as a pound of beef in China. This is the theoretical reason PPPs differ from market exchange rates over time. The relative cost of high-margin products, such as essential pharmaceutical products or cellular telephony, might compare local capacity and willingness to pay as much as relative currency values.

Nevertheless, McDonald&#x27;s is also using different commercial strategies which can result in huge differences for a product. Overall, the price of a Big Mac will be a reflection of its local production and delivery cost, the cost of advertising (considerable in some areas), and most importantly what the local market will bear – quite different from country to country, and not all a reflection of relative currency values.

In some markets, a high-volume and low-margin approach makes most sense to maximize profit, while in others a higher margin will generate more profit. Thus the relative prices reflect more than currency values. For example, a hamburger costs only in France, and in Belgium, but overall, McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in both countries cost roughly the same. Prices of Big Macs can also vary greatly between different areas within a country. For example, a Big Mac sold in New York City will be more expensive than one sold at a McDonald&#x27;s located in a rural area.

One other example is that Russia had one of the cheapest Big Macs at its time in 2019, despite the fact that Moscow was then the most expensive city in the world. Standard food ingredients are cheap in Russia, while restaurants suitable for business dinners with English speaking staff are expensive.

=== Manipulation ===
Critics of the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Argentina and many economists believe that the government has for years falsified consumer price data to understate the country&#x27;s true inflation rate. &quot;The Economist&quot; stated in January 2011 that Big Mac index &quot;does support claims that Argentina&#x27;s government is cooking the books. The gap between its average annual rate of burger inflation (19%) and its official rate (10%) is far bigger than in any other country.&quot; That year the press began reporting on unusual behavior by the more than 200 Argentinean McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. They no longer prominently advertised Big Macs for sale and the sandwich, both individually and as part of value meals, was being sold for an unusually low price compared to other items. Guillermo Moreno, Secretary of Commerce in the Kirchner government, reportedly forced McDonald&#x27;s to sell the Big Mac at an artificially low price to manipulate the country&#x27;s performance on the Big Mac index. In June 2012, the price of the Big Mac value meal suddenly rose by 26%, closer to that of other meals, after &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and other media reported on the unusual pricing.

The Big Mac (and virtually all sandwiches) vary from country to country with differing nutritional values, weights and even nominal size differences.

Not all Big Mac burgers offered by the chain are exclusively beef. In India – which is a predominantly Hindu country – beef burgers are not available at any McDonald&#x27;s outlets. The Chicken Maharaja Mac serves as a substitute for the Big Mac.

There is a lot of variance with the exclusively beef &quot;Big Mac&quot;: the Australian version of the Big Mac has 22% fewer calories than the Canadian version, and is 8% lighter than the version sold in Mexico.

On 1 November 2009, all three of the McDonald&#x27;s in Iceland closed, primarily due to the chain&#x27;s high cost of importing most of the chain&#x27;s meat and vegetables, by McDonald&#x27;s demands and standards, from the Eurozone. At the time, a Big Mac in Iceland cost 650 krona ($5.29), and the 20% price increase that would have been needed to stay in business would have increased that cost to 780 krona ($6.36). Fish and lamb are produced in Iceland, while beef is often imported (but also exported).

<doc id="220888" wikidata="Q2600673" url="?curid=220888" title="Duffman">
<text>Barry Duffman, or Barry Huffman, more commonly known by his work name Duffman, is a character on the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is the mascot and chief spokesperson for Duff Beer. It has been referenced, however, that the corporate mascot &quot;Duffman&quot; has actually been embodied by a number of different actors, though they are virtually identical. He is known for his staccato catchphrase: &quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; (also the character&#x27;s unofficial theme song). He is recognizable by his &quot;Duff&quot;-branded cap, wayfarer sunglasses, red cape, light blue bodysuit, and utility belt stocked with &quot;Duff&quot;.

==Profile==
Barry Huffman, better known as Duffman and voiced by Hank Azaria, is a recurring character who, according to Chris Turner, &quot;embodies all the self-importance and over-statement of contemporary marketing.&quot; He is the mascot for the fictional Duff Corporation that sells Duff Beer, and is based on Budweiser&#x27;s former mascot Bud Man. Duffman is a muscular actor, dressed in a superhero costume who spouts slogans while he thrusts his hips. Duffman&#x27;s thrusts were first acted out by Brad Bird. His catchphrase, &quot;Oh, yeah!&quot;, is a nod to the Yello song &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, which many advertisers began to use when &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; made it a hit. While loyal to his corporate sponsors, in the season 15 episode &quot;Co-Dependents&#x27; Day&quot;, Duffman reveals he is ashamed of betraying his Jewish heritage by doing a Nazi-esque performance at Oktoberfest (&quot;This Reich will last a thousand beers! Oh, &quot;ja&quot;! [muttering]: I do this, and I&#x27;m Jewish.&quot;). In the season 17 episode &quot;Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play&quot;, it was revealed there were two other Duffmen working (but it is kept a secret so as not to disillusion children). &quot;Jaws Wired Shut&quot; revealed that all the actors who have played Duffman have died, a nod to the Marlboro Man deaths, (&quot;Duffman can never die; only the actors who play him&quot;), which sheds some light on the so-called continuity error in which Duffman was referred to as &quot;Larry&quot; in &quot;Pygmoelian&quot;. Howard K. Duff called him &quot;Sid&quot;, in &quot;Hungry, Hungry Homer&quot;, and in &quot;Old Yeller Belly&quot;, he self-identifies (while out of character) as &quot;Barry Duffman&quot;. In &quot;Waiting for Duffman&quot;, in which Duffman retires temporarily and is replaced by Homer, his name is Barry Huffman. The character has been portrayed as Jewish.

Duffman&#x27;s first appearance was in the ninth-season episode &quot;The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson&quot; in 1997. Incidentally, a comic book character named &quot;Duffman&quot; was featured in the cover of the program for the 1994 San Diego Comic-Con, drawn by Simpsons illustrators Steve Vance and Bill Morrison.

There are also international, culture-specific versions of Duffman for the overseas markets. &quot;Duffmensch&quot;, the German version of Duffman, wears a blue pickelhaube helmet and blue spandex lederhosen with a dark leather waistbelt with beer-can holders that look like ammunition pouches. He uses the German language slogan &quot;Oh Ja!&quot;. The Canadian version of Duffman (seen on the label of &quot;Le Duff&quot;, the Canadian version of Duff) wears a Mountie uniform and uses the French-language slogan &quot;Mais Oui!&quot; They are still played by the American Duffman and have his mannerisms.

==Production and reception==
Duffman&#x27;s voice actor, Hank Azaria, has revealed that he &quot;dreads&quot; voicing the character, as it &quot;will blow me out in a second&quot; and &quot;actually does hurt&quot;.

MLB player Matt Duffy, nicknamed &quot;Duffman&quot;, has had the character stenciled on his bats.

<doc id="220890" wikidata="Q1693466" url="?curid=220890" title="Pan-American Exposition">
<text>The Pan-American Exposition was a world&#x27;s fair held in Buffalo, New York, United States, from May 1 through November 2, 1901. The fair occupied of land on the western edge of what is now Delaware Park, extending from Delaware Avenue to Elmwood Avenue and northward to Great Arrow Avenue. It is remembered today primarily for being the location of the assassination of United States President William McKinley at the Temple of Music on September 6, 1901. The exposition was illuminated at night. Thomas A. Edison, Inc. filmed it during the day and a pan of it at night.

==History==
The Pan-American Exposition, often referred to as &quot;The Rainbow City&quot;, received national attention in the press and elsewhere a couple of years before, during and after it occurred During the course of the exposition more than 8,000,000 visitors came to the event.

The event was organized by the Pan-American Exposition Company, formed in 1897. Cayuga Island was initially chosen as the place to hold the Exposition because of the island&#x27;s proximity to Niagara Falls, which was a huge tourist attraction. When the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898, plans were put on hold. After the war, there was a heated competition between the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls over the location. Buffalo won for two main reasons. First, Buffalo had a much larger population; with roughly 350,000 people, it was the eighth-largest city in the United States. Second, Buffalo had better railroad connections; the city was also located on the east shore of Lake Erie and serviced by 12 steamship lines, and was within a day&#x27;s journey by rail or steamship for over 40 million people. The Pan-American Exposition was distinctive from its former predecessors in that it was the first exposition to employ a central theme in its overall design and layout, employing extensive lighting on and about the buildings and other structures, along with color, and sculpture to obtain its harmony. It was also the first exposition with a global unifying theme that emphasized the concept of Pan-Americanism.

The planning committee considered some twenty different locations for the exposition and after much consideration and deliberation a 350-acre tract in the western area of Delaware Park was selected. The grounds on which the exposition would be constructed extended from Delaware Ave. to Elmwood and from Park Lake northward to present Great Arrow. The total expense for the exposition came to US$7 million. ($ in dollars.)
In March 3, 1899, Congress pledged $500 000, and publicly declared that &quot;it is desirable to encourage the holding of a Pan-American Exposition on the Niagara Frontier in the City of Buffalo, in the year 1901, fittingly to illustrate the marvelous development of the Western Hemisphere during the Nineteenth Century, by a display of the arts, industries, manufactures and the products of the soil, mine and sea...The &quot;Pan American&quot; theme was carried throughout the event with the slogan &quot;commercial well being and good understanding among the American Republics.&quot; The advent of the alternating current power transmission system in the US allowed designers to light the Exposition in Buffalo using power generated away at Niagara Falls.

In the months preceding the exposition promotional pamphlets, newspaper articles, guide books and other publications were published and released around the United States and elsewhere. Among them were a number of different publications from the Pan-American exposition company in Buffalo, along with publications from Rand McNally in New York.

===Events and attractions===
At the opening of the Pan-American Exposition on &quot;Dedication Day&quot;, March 20, 1901, a procession led by Vice-President Roosevelt, who was attended by a number of dignitaries, which included Governor Odell, of New York, Conrad Diehl, the mayor of Buffalo, Senator Hanna, of Ohio, and Senator Gallinger, of New Hampshire. Leading the military division of the parade was Louis Babcock, Grand Marshal of the Exposition parade, which also included the first division, consisting of the 71st Regiment Band and other military brigades. The procession passed over the monumental Triumphal Bridge which passes over Mirror Lake, and proceeded to the Temple of Music. More than 100,000 people were in attendance. At the temple they listened to various key note speakers, where the idea of &quot;America for the Americans&quot; was emphasized.

Though the Pan-American Exposition featured many exhibits that possessed commercial and transportation and different worldly themes, it was also considered to be an art exhibition, with many American paintings, sculptures and other works of art from Canada and other countries, all of which were displayed in the Exposition&#x27;s Albright Art Gallery and other locations about the fairgrounds. The Exposition also served to define what was officially to be considered &quot;American Art&quot; at the turn of the century.
In May 1901 the U.S. Post Office began issuing a series of six commemorative stamps to help promote and fund the exposition. The stamps depicted the various modern transportation themes that were featured at the exposition. The stamps were placed on sale at the exposition from May 1 to October 31, 1901. Post Offices in Buffalo post-marked out-going mail with a number of different specially made postmarks inscribed with the words, &quot;Pan-American Exposition, 1901&quot;. The Pan American issues were the first commemorative stamps to be issued in the 20th century.
On September 4, President McKinley arrived and was greeted by thousands of people in anticipation of his visit. Also in September, former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan visited the exposition and made an appearance at the exhibit of the Bureau of Indian Affairs with several prominent Sioux Indian chiefs, including Red Cloud, High Hawk and Blue Horse. Also present were chiefs from the Six Nations League of the Iroquois Confederacy, dressed in the traditional attire of their ancestors. Arriving during the preparatory stages of the Exposition, they erected various long houses that were once commonplace in their home lands of central New York, while they were attended by various translators.

Lina Beecher, creator of the Flip Flap Railway, attempted to demonstrate one of his looping roller coasters at the fair, but the organizers of the event considered the ride to be too dangerous and refused to allow it on the grounds. Buffalo native Nina Morgana, later a soprano with the Metropolitan Opera, was a child performer in the &quot;Venice in America&quot; attraction at the Exposition. Composer/organist Fannie Morris Spencer gave two recitals in the Temple of Music.
Other attractions included The Great Amphitheater, Joshua Slocum&#x27;s sloop, the &quot;Spray&quot;, on which he had recently sailed around the world alone, the Trip to the Moon exhibit, a mechanical dark ride that was later housed at Coney Island&#x27;s Luna Park. In the center of the rose-garden beside the Woman&#x27;s Building was Enid Yandell&#x27;s &quot;Struggle of Existence,&quot; and a plaster version of the fountain &quot;Struggle of Life&quot; installed in Rhode Island.

On the last day of the exposition, Saturday, November 2, a sham battle was staged at the Stadium at the Pan-American Exhibition The several hundred participants included the six tribes of American Indians, dressed in traditional garb, and the United States Infantry stationed at Buffalo. The event also included theatrical explosive charges, weaponry and many hand to hand combat encounters, and was said to be realistic in its presentation.

===Assassination of President McKinley===
The exposition is often remembered because it was the location where United States President William McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, at the Temple of Music on September 6, 1901. The President died eight days later on September 14 from gangrene caused by the bullet wounds. McKinley&#x27;s last words, from a favorite hymn, were, &quot;Nearer my God to Thee, Nearer to Thee&quot;.

McKinley&#x27;s presence at the Exposition was widely advertised by newspapers and magazines which played a significant role in attracting many thousands of people to the event. Of his visit to the exposition, McKinley&#x27;s secretary of State, John Hay, remarked, &quot;Never had I seen him higher in hope and patriotic confidence.&quot;

His arrival was the source of great concern for the Secret Service, the Exposition police and others who were assigned to McKinley&#x27;s security. The year before a plot to kill the president had been discovered, while two other world leaders had recently been assassinated. Normally people who would draw near to the president were required to have their hands empty and in plain sight, but for reasons not clear, this rule was not strictly enforced.

On the day prior to the shooting, McKinley had given an address at the exposition, which began as follows:
The day after, McKinley appeared in the Temple of Music to shake hands with lucky attendees. Czolgosz was in the line, and hid a revolver beneath a handkerchief he had wrapped around his right hand. When he reached McKinley, he shot him multiple times and was then attacked by attendees. McKinley urged the attendees to spare his assassin, and after McKinley died, Czolgosz was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death.
The newly developed X-ray machine was displayed at the fair, but doctors were reluctant to use it on McKinley to search for the bullet because they did not know what side effects it might have had on him. Also, the operating room at the exposition&#x27;s emergency hospital did not have any electric lighting, even though the exteriors of many of the buildings were covered with thousands of light bulbs. Doctors used a pan to reflect sunlight onto the operating table as they treated McKinley&#x27;s wounds.

==Buildings and exhibits==
Buildings and exhibits featured at the Pan-American Exposition included:

==Demolition==
When the fair ended, the contents of the grounds were sold to the Chicago House Wrecking Company of Chicago for US$92,000 ($ in dollars). Demolition of the buildings began in March 1902, and within a year, most of the buildings were demolished. The grounds were then cleared and subdivided to be used for residential streets, homes, and park land. Similar to previous world fairs, most of the buildings were constructed of timber and steel framing with precast staff panels made of a plaster/fiber mix. These buildings were built as a means of rapid construction and temporary ornamentation and not made to last. Prior to its demolition, an effort was made via public committee to purchase and preserve the original Electric Tower from the wrecking company for nearly US$30,000 ($ in dollars). However, the necessary funding could not be raised in time.

The site of the exposition was bounded by Elmwood Avenue on the west, Delaware Avenue on the east, what is now Hoyt Lake on the south, and the railway on the north. It is now occupied by a residential neighborhood from Nottingham Terrace to Amherst Street, and businesses on the north side of Amherst Street. A stone and marker on a traffic island dividing Fordham Drive, near the Lincoln Parkway, marks the area where the Temple of Music was located.

==Legacy==
*The New York State Building, located in Delaware Park, was designed to outlast the Exposition and has been the home of the Buffalo History Museum since 1902. Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, it can be visited at the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Nottingham Avenue. The Museum&#x27;s Research Library has an online bibliography of its extensive Pan-American holdings. Included in the Library collection are the records of the Pan-American Exposition Company.
*The Albright-Knox Art Gallery was intended to serve as a Fine Arts Pavilion but due to construction delays, it was not completed in time.
*While the original Electric Tower may have inspired the 13 story Beaux-Arts General Electric Tower, built in 1912 in downtown Buffalo, the General Electric building is not a faithful replica. 
*The Hotel Statler was demolished after 1901. Ellsworth Statler then built second Buffalo hotel in 1907, then a third in 1923.
*A boulder with a plaque and a flagpole marking the site of McKinley&#x27;s assassination was placed in the grassy median on Fordham Drive in Buffalo.
*At least one engine from the miniature railway that carried visitors around the fair was preserved. It is currently privately owned and operated in Braddock Heights, Maryland.

<doc id="220895" wikidata="Q5595524" url="?curid=220895" title="Grandparent visitation">
<text>Grandparent visitation is a legal right that grandparents in some jurisdictions may have to have court-ordered contact (or visitation) with their grandchildren. In no case is contact between grandparents and children considered an inalienable right.

==United States==
, all US states have statutes that permit non-parents to ask a court to grant them the legal right to maintain ongoing contact with a child. In many states, these statutes explicitly name grandparents and great-grandparents as potentially eligible people. These requests must be justifiable as being in the best interests of the child, and they may only apply under certain circumstances, such as after one parent dies or loses custody.

State statutes pertaining to grandparent visitation must comport with the United States Supreme Court decision of &quot;Troxel v. Granville&quot;. This case, decided in 2000, involved a dispute between a widowed mother and her deceased partners parents, the child&#x27;s paternal grandparents. The mother limited the grandparents time with her child, and the grandparents brought suit in Washington state. The trial court ruled that the paternal grandparents were entitled to visitation and set forth a schedule in its order delineating when and where the grandparents were permitted to see their grandchild. The mother appealed the decision, arguing that the Washington statute was unconstitutional. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional on its face (that it could not be constitutionally applied in any circumstance), that the trial court had erred in requiring the mother to prove why visitation should not be granted rather than the burden of proof being on the petitioning party, and that the best interests standard alone is not enough to interfere with a parents constitutional right to control the upbringing of their children.

State laws vary greatly, and no state guarantees that the petitioning grandparents will receive a court order granting them visitation. All states, however, require the best interests of the child to be a controlling factor upon certain standards being met.

===Impact of &quot;Troxel v. Granville&quot;===
In the case of &quot;Troxel v. Granville&quot;, the United States Supreme Court stated that &quot;the interest of parents in the care, custody and control of their children–is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.&quot; The Supreme Court also said that this fundamental right is implicated in grandparent visitation cases, when visitation orders are imposed over parental objection. 

The court held that grandparent visitation laws were not unconstitutional on their face, as requested in the case. The Supreme Court declared that a parent&#x27;s fundamental right to the &quot;care, custody and control of their children&quot; was &quot;at issue in this case.&quot; They held that in order for state laws to be constitutional, three things need to be in the law: 

# If there is a claim or action filed, it is the grandparent that has the burden of proof; 
# The court should give &quot;deference&quot; to a &quot;fit&quot; parent&#x27;s decision; and 
# The grandparent may still proceed with their request for grandparent visitation and overcome being denied contact; and each state should have a set of factors for the court to evaluate when deciding to either grant or deny a grandparent&#x27;s request, over a parent&#x27;s objections. 

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the statute impermissibly interfered with a parents fundamental right to raise their child as they saw fit in that the statute was “breathtakingly over broad” and allowed anyone, biologically related or not, to, at any time, petition the court for an order granting them contact with a child.

State courts considering non-parent visitation petitions must apply &quot;a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.&quot;. &quot;Troxel&quot; requires that state courts must give &quot;deference&quot; or some special weight to a fit parent&#x27;s decision to deny non-parent visitation. &quot;Choices [parents make] about the upbringing of children... are among constitutional rights, but were not an absolute right... sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State&#x27;s unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect.&quot; This principle must inform the understanding of the &quot;special weight&quot; that &quot;Troxel&quot; requires courts to give to parents&#x27; decisions concerning their choices regarding how the grandparents will associate with their children. Even though &quot;Troxel&quot; does not define &quot;special weight,&quot; previous Supreme Court precedent indicates that &quot;special weight&quot; is a strong term signifying very considerable deference. The &quot;special weight&quot; requirement, as illuminated by the Supreme Court in its previously decided cases, means that the deference provided to the parent&#x27;s wishes will be overcome only by some compelling governmental interest and by overwhelmingly clear factual circumstances supporting that governmental interest.

==Italy==
Limited grandparent visitation rights exist in Italy.

<text>Johann Dominicus Fiorillo (13 October 1748 – 10 September 1821) was a German painter and historian of art.

Fiorillo, a son of Italian composer Ignazio Fiorillo, was born at Hamburg, Holy Roman Empire. He received his first instructions in art at an academy of painting at Bayreuth; and in 1761, to continue his studies, he went first to Rome, and next to Bologna, where he distinguished himself sufficiently to attain in 1769 admission to the academy. Returning soon after to Germany, he obtained the appointment of historical painter to the court of Brunswick.

In 1781 he removed to Göttingen, occupied himself as a drawingmaster, and was named in 1784 keeper of the collection of prints at the university library. He was appointed professor extraordinary in the philosophical faculty in 1799, and ordinary professor at Göttingen University in 1813. During this period he had made himself known as a writer by the publication of his &quot;Geschichte der zeichnenden Künste&quot;, in 5 volumes (1798–1808). This was followed in 1815 to 1820 by the &quot;Geschichte der zeichnenden Künste in Deutschland und den vereinigten Niederlanden&quot;, in 4 volumes. These works, though not attaining to any high mark of literary excellence, are esteemed for the information collected in them, especially on the subject of art in the later Middle Ages. Fiorillo practiced his art almost until his death, but has left no memorable masterpiece. The most noticeable of his painting is perhaps the &quot;Surrender of Briseis&quot;.

He died at Göttingen.

<doc id="220901" wikidata="Q1211457" url="?curid=220901" title="Software release life cycle">
<text>The software release life cycle is the process of developing, testing, and distributing a software product (e.g., an operating system). It typically consists of several stages, such as pre-alpha, alpha, beta, and release candidate, before the final version, or &quot;gold&quot;, is released to the public.

Pre-alpha refers to the early stages of development, when the software is still being designed and built. Alpha testing is the first phase of formal testing, during which the software is tested internally using white-box techniques. Beta testing is the next phase, in which the software is tested by a larger group of users, typically outside of the organization that developed it. The beta phase is focused on reducing impacts on users and may include usability testing.

After beta testing, the software may go through one or more release candidate phases, in which it is refined and tested further, before the final version is released.

Some software, particularly in the internet and technology industries, is released in a perpetual beta state, meaning that it is continuously being updated and improved, and is never considered to be a fully completed product. This approach allows for a more agile development process and enables the software to be released and used by users earlier in the development cycle.

== Stages of development ==

=== Pre-alpha ===
Pre-alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project before formal testing. These activities can include requirements analysis, software design, software development, and unit testing. In typical open source development, there are several types of pre-alpha versions. &quot;Milestone&quot; versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the feature is complete.

The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase of software testing (alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, used as the number 1). In this phase, developers generally test the software using white-box techniques. Additional validation is then performed using black-box or gray-box techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black-box testing inside the organization is known as &quot;alpha release&quot;.

Alpha software is not thoroughly tested by the developer before it is released to customers. Alpha software may contain serious errors, and any resulting instability could cause crashes or data loss. Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version. In general, external availability of alpha software is uncommon for proprietary software, while open source software often has publicly available alpha versions. The alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze, indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be feature-complete. A beta test is carried out following acceptance testing at the supplier&#x27;s site (the alpha test) and immediately before the general release of the software as a product.

==== Feature-complete ====
A feature-complete (FC) version of a piece of software has all of its planned or primary features implemented but is not yet final due to bugs, performance or stability issues. This occurs at the end of alpha testing in development.

Usually, feature-complete software still has to undergo beta testing and bug fixing, as well as performance or stability enhancement before it can go to release candidate, and finally gold status.

=== Beta ===

Beta, named after the second letter of the Greek alphabet, is the software development phase following alpha. A beta phase generally begins when the software is feature-complete but likely to contain several known or unknown bugs. Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software and speed or performance issues, and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts on users, often incorporating usability testing. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called &quot;beta release&quot; and is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it. Software beta releases can be either open or closed, depending on whether they are openly available or only available to a limited audience. Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization and to prospective customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a &quot;preview&quot;, &quot;preview release&quot;, &quot;prototype&quot;, &quot;technical preview&quot; or &quot;technology preview&quot; (&quot;TP&quot;), or &quot;early access&quot;.

&quot;Beta testers&quot; are people who actively report issues with beta software. They are usually customers or representatives of prospective customers of the organization that develops the software. Beta testers tend to volunteer their services free of charge but often receive versions of the product they test, discounts on the release version, or other incentives.

==== Perpetual beta ====
Some software is kept in so-called &quot;perpetual beta&quot;, where new features are continually added to the software without establishing a final &quot;stable&quot; release. As the Internet has facilitated the rapid and inexpensive distribution of software, companies have begun to take a looser approach to the use of the word &quot;beta&quot;.

==== Open and closed beta ====
Developers may release either a &quot;closed beta&quot;, or an &quot;open beta&quot;; closed beta versions are released to a restricted group of individuals for a user test by invitation, while open beta testers are from a larger group, or anyone interested. Private beta could be suitable for the software that is capable of delivering value but is not ready to be used by everyone either due to scaling issues, lack of documentation or still missing vital features. The testers report any bugs that they find, and sometimes suggest additional features they think should be available in the final version.

Open betas serve the dual purpose of demonstrating a product to potential consumers, and testing among a wide user base is likely to bring to light obscure errors that a much smaller testing team might not find.

=== Release candidate ===
A &quot;release candidate&quot; (&quot;RC&quot;), also known as gamma testing or &quot;going silver&quot;, is a beta version with the potential to be a stable product, which is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. In this stage of product stabilization, all product features have been designed, coded, and tested through one or more beta cycles with no known showstopper-class bugs. A release is called &quot;code complete&quot; when the development team agrees that no entirely new source code will be added to this release. There could still be source code changes to fix defects, changes to documentation and data files, and peripheral code for test cases or utilities.

=== Stable release ===
Also called &quot;production release&quot;, the &quot;stable release&quot; is the last &quot;release candidate&quot; (&quot;RC&quot;) which has passed all stages of verification and tests. Any known remaining bugs are considered acceptable. This release goes to production.

Some software products (e.g. Linux distributions like Debian) also have &quot;long-term support&quot; (&quot;LTS&quot;) releases which are based on full releases that have already been tried and tested and receive only security updates.

== Release ==
Once released, the software is generally known as a &quot;stable release&quot;. The formal term often depends on the method of release: physical media, online release, or a web application.

=== Release to manufacturing (RTM) ===

The term &quot;release to manufacturing&quot; (RTM), also known as &quot;going gold&quot;, is a term used when a software product is ready to be delivered. This build may be digitally signed, allowing the end user to verify the integrity and authenticity of the software purchase. The RTM build is known as the &quot;gold master&quot; or GM is sent for mass duplication or disc replication if applicable. The terminology is taken from the audio record-making industry, specifically the process of mastering. RTM precedes general availability (GA) when the product is released to the public. A golden master build (GM) is typically the final build of a piece of software in the beta stages for developers. Typically, for iOS, it is the final build before a major release, however, there have been a few exceptions.

RTM is typically used in certain retail mass-production software contexts—as opposed to a specialized software production or project in a commercial or government production and distribution—where the software is sold as part of a bundle in a related computer hardware sale and typically where the software and related hardware is ultimately to be available and sold on mass/public basis at retail stores to indicate that the software has met a defined quality level and is ready for mass retail distribution. RTM could also mean in other contexts that the software has been delivered or released to a client or customer for installation or distribution to the related hardware end user computers or machines. The term does &quot;not&quot; define the delivery mechanism or volume; it only states that the quality is sufficient for mass distribution. The deliverable from the engineering organization is frequently in the form of a golden master media used for duplication or to produce the image for the web.

=== General availability (GA) ===

General availability (GA) is the marketing stage at which all necessary commercialization activities have been completed and a software product is available for purchase, depending, however, on language, region, and electronic vs. media availability. Commercialization activities could include security and compliance tests, as well as localization and worldwide availability. The time between RTM and GA can take from days to months before a generally available release can be declared, due to the time needed to complete all commercialization activities required by GA. At this stage, the software has &quot;gone live&quot;.

=== Release to the Web (RTW) ===
Release to the Web (RTW) or Web release is a means of software delivery that utilizes the Internet for distribution. No physical media are produced in this type of release mechanism by the manufacturer. Web releases have become more common as Internet usage has grown.

== Support ==
During its supported lifetime, the software is sometimes subjected to service releases, patches or service packs, sometimes also called &quot;interim releases&quot; or &quot;maintenance releases&quot; (MR). For example, Microsoft released three major service packs for the 32-bit editions of Windows XP and two service packs for the 64-bit editions. Such service releases contain a collection of updates, fixes, and enhancements, delivered in the form of a single installable package. They may also implement new features. Some software is released with the expectation of regular support. Classes of software that generally involve protracted support as the norm include anti-virus suites and massively multiplayer online games. Continuing with this Windows XP example, Microsoft did offer paid updates for five more years after the end of extended support. This means that support ended on April 8, 2019.

=== End-of-life ===
When software is no longer sold or supported, the product is said to have reached end-of-life, to be discontinued, retired, deprecated, abandoned, or obsolete, but user loyalty may continue its existence for some time, even long after its platform is obsolete—e.g., the Common Desktop Environment and Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

After the end-of-life date, the developer will usually not implement any new features, fix existing defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities (whether known before that date or not), or provide any support for the product. If the developer wishes, they may release the source code, so that the platform may be maintained by volunteers.

== History ==
Usage of the &quot;alpha/beta&quot; test terminology originated at IBM. Similar terminologies for IBM&#x27;s software development were used by people involved with IBM from at least the 1950s (and probably earlier). &quot;A&quot; test was the verification of a new product before the public announcement. The &quot;B&quot; test was the verification before releasing the product to be manufactured. The &quot;C&quot; test was the final test before the general availability of the product. As software became a significant part of IBM&#x27;s offerings, the alpha test terminology was used to denote the pre-announcement test and the beta test was used to show product readiness for general availability. Martin Belsky, a manager on some of IBM&#x27;s earlier software projects claimed to have invented the terminology. IBM dropped the alpha/beta terminology during the 1960s, but by then it had received fairly wide notice. The usage of &quot;beta test&quot; to refer to testing done by customers was not done in IBM. Rather, IBM used the term &quot;field test&quot;.

Major public betas developed afterward, with early customers having purchased a &quot;pioneer edition&quot; of the WordVision word processor for the IBM PC for $49.95. In 1984, Stephen Manes wrote that &quot;in a brilliant marketing coup, Bruce and James Program Publishers managed to get people to &quot;pay&quot; for the privilege of testing the product.&quot; In September 2000, a &quot;boxed version&quot; of Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X Public Beta operating system was released. Between September 2005 and May 2006, Microsoft released &quot;community technology preview&quot;s (&quot;CTP&quot;s) for Windows Vista. From 2009 to 2011, &quot;Minecraft&quot; was in public beta.

In February 2005, ZDNet published an article about the phenomenon of a beta version often staying for years and being used as if it were at the production level. It noted that Gmail and Google News, for example, had been in beta for a long time although widely used; Google News left beta in January 2006, followed by Google Apps (now named Google Workspace), including Gmail, in July 2009. Since the introduction of Windows 8, Microsoft has called pre-release software a &quot;preview&quot; rather than &quot;beta&quot;. All pre-release builds released through the Windows Insider Program launched in 2014 are termed &quot;Insider Preview builds&quot;. &quot;Beta&quot; may also indicate something more like a release candidate, or as a form of time-limited demo, or marketing technique.

<text>The Mundanes were an early-1980s Rhode Island–based new wave band with six members: John Andrews, Marsha Armitage, Jonathan Gregg, Dean Lozow, and Kevin Tooley, and John Linnell.

Marsha Armitage was the lead vocalist. The band was initially based in Providence (several of the band members attended Brown University) and played locally in the Boston–Providence area. The band generated tremendous energy and had a devoted following, but struggled to sign to a record label. In 1981, the band relocated to New York City. Shortly thereafter, John Linnell left the band to pursue another musical project, They Might Be Giants, with John Flansburgh. Drummer Kevin Tooley was replaced by Peter Clemente, and Jim Gillson replaced John Linnell on keyboards. The band continued to gig in New England and played frequently in New York City venues, including CBGB. David Hemming, who had previously managed Pat Travers and Ozzy Osbourne, took on the band&#x27;s management. They recorded a demo at RCA Studios, produced by Mick Ronson, that attracted record label attention, but the band remained unsigned and ultimately broke up in mid-1983.

<text>The of 1855 (), better known in English as the 1855 Paris Exposition, was a world&#x27;s fair held on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, France, from 15 May to 15 November 1855. Its full official title was the . It was the first of ten major expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937. Nowadays, the exposition&#x27;s sole physical remnant is the Théâtre du Rond-Point des Champs-Élysées, designed by architect Gabriel Davioud, which originally housed the Panorama National.

== History ==
The exposition was a major event in France, then newly under the reign of Emperor Napoleon III. It followed London&#x27;s Great Exhibition of 1851 and attempted to surpass that fair&#x27;s Crystal Palace with its own Palais de l&#x27;Industrie.

The arts displayed were shown in a separate pavilion on Avenue Montaigne. There were works from artists from 29 countries, including French artists François Rude, Ingres, Delacroix and Henri Lehmann, and British artists William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. However, Gustave Courbet, having had several of his paintings rejected, exhibited in a temporary &quot;Pavillon du Réalisme&quot; adjacent to the official show.

According to its official report, 5,162,330 visitors attended the exposition, of whom about 4.2 million entered the industrial exposition and 900,000 entered the Beaux Arts exposition. Expenses amounted to upward of $5,000,000, while receipts were scarcely one-tenth of that amount. The exposition covered with 34 countries participating.

For the exposition, Napoleon III requested a classification system for France&#x27;s best Bordeaux wines which were to be on display for visitors from around the world. Brokers from the wine industry ranked the wines according to a château&#x27;s reputation and trading price, which at that time was directly related to quality. The result was the important Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855.

== Influence on art ==
* The Rise of Realism: In the exposition, the French Realist painter Gustave Courbet had some of his works rejected by the official salon. He set his own pavilion called Pavilion of Realism, close to the main exhibition to display his work. Realism, which focused on portraying the everyday lives of common people with accuracy and without idealization, grew as a response to the academic and elite tendencies of art. By rebelling against the dominant trends, Courbet and his followers helped solidify Realism as a serious movement in the years that followed.
* Promotion of Neoclassicism and Romanticism: Neoclassicism and Romanticism, the two dominant movements of the time was featured in the exposition. Key figures like Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (Neoclassicism) and Eugène Delacroix (Romanticism) presented their work, showcasing the stylistic debates of the time. This clash between Neoclassicism’s strict formality and Romanticism’s emotional intensity helped shape the public discourse on the purpose of art and laid the groundwork for future developments in artistic expression.
* Introduction of Photography as an Art Form: Photography was also officially presented for the first time at the 1855 exposition. Its inclusion sparked discussions about its artistic potential and its relationship to painting. Photography’s role in capturing reality influenced artists, especially those in the Realist and Impressionist movements, who sought to depict the world with accuracy and immediacy.
* Expansion of the Audience for Art: Before the exposition, the art world was largely limited to aristocratic circles and private academies, but the Exposition Universelle brought art to the masses, fostering a greater appreciation for different styles and making art more accessible.
* International Artistic Dialogue: The 1855 exposition was one of the first global showcases of art, bringing artists from various countries together in a single venue. This allowed for the exchange of artistic ideas and techniques across borders. The cross-cultural interaction would influence artists&#x27; perspectives, expanding the scope of what art could represent.
* Technological and Artistic Advancements: The exposition also featured innovations in art-making materials, such as the introduction of premixed oil paints in tubes, which allowed artists greater mobility and flexibility to work outdoors. This innovation became crucial for the later Impressionist painters like Édouard Manet and Claude Monet, who emphasized capturing natural light and the changing atmosphere.

== Inventions and Innovations ==
The 1855 exposition featured many early versions of modern inventions. The exposition featured the first ever lawn mower, Moore&#x27;s washing machine, the first non-industrial sewing machine, one of the first oil-powered vehicles, Samuel Colt’s revolver, and Edouard Loysel de Santais’ hydrostatic percolator which could produce 50,000 cups of coffee in a day.

<text>Odette Marie Léonie Céline Hallowes, (née Brailly; 28 April 1912 – 13 March 1995), also known as Odette Churchill and Odette Sansom, code named Lise, was an agent for the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) in France during the Second World War. She was the first woman to be awarded the George Cross by the United Kingdom and was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur by France. The following information relating to her war service uses &#x27;Sansom&#x27; as this was her surname during this period. 

The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers, especially Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. 

Sansom arrived in France on the night of 3/4 November 1942 to work as a courier with the Spindle network (or circuit) of SOE headed by Peter Churchill (whom she later married). In January 1943, to evade arrest, Churchill and Sansom moved their operations to near Annecy in the French Alps. She and Churchill were arrested there on 16 April 1943 by spy-hunter Hugo Bleicher. She spent the rest of the war imprisoned in Ravensbrück Concentration Camp.

Her wartime experiences and endurance of a brutal interrogation and imprisonment, which were chronicled in books and a motion picture, made her one of the most celebrated members of the SOE, and one of the few to survive Nazi imprisonment.

==Early years==
Odette Marie Léonie Céline Brailly was born on 28 April 1912 at 208, rue des Corroyers in Amiens, France; the daughter of Emma Rose Marie Yvonne née Quennehen and Florentin Désiré Eugène &#x27;Gaston&#x27; Brailly, a bank manager, killed at Verdun shortly before the Armistice in 1918 and posthumously awarded the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; and &quot;Médaille militaire&quot; for heroism. She had one brother. As a child she contracted serious illnesses which blinded her for three and a half years, as well as polio, which resulted in her being bedridden for months. She had a convent education and was considered difficult, perhaps because of her illnesses.

She met an Englishman, Roy Patrick Sansom (1911–1957), in Boulogne and married him in Boulogne-sur-Mer on 27 October 1931, moving with him to Britain. The couple had three daughters: Françoise Edith, born 1932 in Boulogne; Lily Marie, born 1934 in Fulham; and Marianne Odette, born 1936 in Fulham. Mr. Sansom joined the army at the beginning of the Second World War, and Odette Sansom and the children moved to Somerset for their safety.

==Second World War service==

===Recruited by SOE===
In the spring of 1942, the Admiralty appealed for postcards or family photographs taken on the French coastline for possible war use. Hearing the broadcast, Sansom wrote that she had photographs taken around Boulogne, but she mistakenly sent her letter to the War Office instead of the Admiralty. That brought her to the attention of Colonel Maurice Buckmaster&#x27;s Special Operations Executive.

As cover for her secret work, Sansom was enrolled in the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, which supplied SOE with support personnel. She left her three daughters in a convent school, and was trained to be sent into Nazi-occupied France to work with the French Resistance.

Originally Sansom was considered too temperamental and stubborn by SOE, with an evaluation stating &quot;She is impulsive and hasty in her judgments and has not quite the clarity of mind which is desirable in subversive activity. She seems to have little experience of the outside world. She is excitable and temperamental, although she has a certain determination.&quot; However, the evaluation noted &quot;her patriotism and keenness to do something for France.&quot; Buckmaster allowed her training to continue regardless. A bad fall during training ruled out parachute entry into France.

George Starr, one of SOE&#x27;s most successful agents and a self-described martinet, called Sansom &quot;a dreadful lady&quot; and deplored what he portrayed as her seductive behaviour. Lise de Baissac, who trained in the same SOE class, said Sansom always wanted to be the centre of attention and often compared herself to Joan of Arc.

===Service in France===

Sansom made a landing on a beach near Cassis on the night of 3/4 November 1942, and made contact with Captain Peter Churchill, who headed Spindle, an SOE network based in Cannes. Her code name was &quot;Lise&quot;. Sansom&#x27;s initial objective was to contact the French Resistance on the French Riviera, and then move to Auxerre in Burgundy to establish a safe house for other agents. 

At the time of her arrival in France, the Spindle network was beset by internal strife between the principal agent, André Girard, his assistant and the network&#x27;s radio operator, Adolphe Rabinovitch. A list of 200 potential supporters, lost by André Marsac, a Girard courier, was obtained by the Germans. With Sansom stranded in Cannes, Churchill obtained Buckmaster&#x27;s permission to scrap her original mission and for her to act as his courier. Sansom, posing as &quot;Madame Odette Metayer&quot;, was required to find food and lodging for Rabinovitch, who was in France illegally and had no ration card, as well as to tend to air drops that were sometimes carelessly placed in dangerous areas. Her work brought her initially to Marseille, then considered a dangerous town because of its infiltration by German agents. Sansom was shocked by the lax attitude towards security by her French supporters. Sansom grew close to Churchill and to Rabinovitch, whom she liked and trusted. She later recalled that she had suspicions of disloyalty about other members of the Spindle network, but declined to identify whom she suspected.

===Captured===
In January 1943, the Spindle team of Churchill, Rabinovich, and Sansom, feeling vulnerable to German capture, moved north from the French Riviera to the quiet Italian-occupied Annecy area in the French Alps. Churchill and Sansom took up residence at the Hotel de la Poste in the village of Saint-Jorioz. They were joined there by several other members of the Carte network and SOE, a gathering which attracted the attention of the Italian fascist police and the Gestapo. SOE agent Francis Cammaerts visited Annecy briefly in March or early April 1943 and assessed the security of Churchill and Sansom&#x27;s network as deficient and likely to be penetrated by the Germans.

Meanwhile, in Paris in mid-March, spy-catcher Hugo Bleicher, an Abwehr counterintelligence officer, arrested Marsac, persuading him and another Carte associate, Roger Bardet, that he was an anti-Nazi German colonel and that they should work together. He learned from Marsac the location of Churchill and Sansom, got a letter of introduction to them from him, and proceeded to Saint-Jorioz where he introduced himself to Sansom as &quot;Colonel Henri&quot;. He spun a tale to her of them travelling together to London to &quot;discuss means of ending the war.&quot; He then departed Saint-Jorioz with a plan to return and for them to leave France together clandestinely by aircraft on April 18. Sansom instructed Rabinovich to send a wireless message to SOE headquarters in London reporting the contact. London replied immediately: &quot;Henri highly dangerous... you are to hide across lake and cut contacts with all save Arnaud [Rabinovich]...&quot;
Churchill was in London consulting with SOE at the time of Bleicher&#x27;s meeting with Sansom. He was warned to avoid contact with Sansom and &#x27;Colonel Henri&quot; on his return to France, but when he was parachuted back into the Annecy area on April 14/15, he was met by Sansom and Rabinovich. As Sansom did not anticipate Henri&#x27;s return until April 18, she and Churchill proceeded to the hotel in Saint-Jorioz. At 2:00 a.m. on April 16, Bleicher, no longer in the guise of &quot;Colonel Henri&quot;, appeared in the hotel with Italian soldiers and arrested Sansom and Churchill.

=== Imprisonment ===

====Fresnes Prison====

At Fresnes prison, near Paris, Sansom was interrogated by the Gestapo fourteen times. She was subjected to torture. Her back was scorched with a red-hot poker and all of her toenails were pulled out. She refused to disclose the whereabouts of Rabinovitch and another British agent, stuck to her fabricated cover story that Churchill was the nephew of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, that she was his wife, and that he knew nothing of her activities. The hope was that, in this way, their treatment would be mitigated. The British had calculated that, if the Germans thought she was related to the British Prime Minister, they would want to keep her alive as a possible bargaining tool.

Sansom succeeded in diverting attention from Churchill, who was subject to only two interrogations, and protected the identities of the two officers whose locations were known only to her. Bleicher occasionally appeared and suggested that they might go to concerts and visit restaurants together in Paris, in return for which he hoped she could be induced to talk. Sansom rejected the overtures.

In June 1943, Sansom was condemned to death on two counts, to which she responded, &quot;Then you will have to make up your mind on what count I am to be executed, because I can only die once.&quot; Infuriated, Bleicher sent her to Ravensbrück concentration camp.

==== Ravensbruck concentration camp ====

In Ravensbruck, Sansom was kept in a punishment block cell, on a starvation diet, and could hear other prisoners being beaten.

After the Allied landings in the south of France in August 1944, on orders from Berlin, all food was withdrawn for a week, all light was removed from Sansom&#x27;s cell, and the heat was turned up. Despite a report by the camp doctor that she would not survive such conditions for more than a few weeks, after being found unconscious in her cell, she was placed in solitary confinement. Her conditions only improved in December 1944, when she was moved to a ground floor cell. The cell was located near the crematorium and would be covered with burned hair from the cremations. At one point toward the end of the war, she witnessed an instance of cannibalism of a dead inmate by starving prisoners.

When the Allies were only a few miles from Ravensbrück, the camp commandant Fritz Suhren forced Sansom into his car and drove to the advancing Americans to surrender. He hoped that her supposed connections to the Prime Minister might allow him to negotiate his way out of execution. Sansom removed Suhren&#x27;s pistol, which is now held in the Imperial War Museum.

Peter Churchill survived the war but Rabinovitch was executed by the Gestapo in 1944.

====Survival methods====
Sansom was aided in her endurance in prison by her early blindness and paralysis, and by the example of her grandfather, who &quot;did not accept weakness very easily.&quot; She also accepted in advance that she might be captured by the Germans. She adopted an attitude of defiance, and found that this resulted in a degree of respect by her captors and helped her survive the imprisonment mentally.

Sansom said she believed she was &quot;not brave, not courageous, but just made up [her] mind about certain things.&quot; She recalled in a post-war interview that while everyone has a breaking point, her feeling was that if she could &quot;survive the next minute without breaking up, that is another minute of life. And if I can think that way instead of thinking what is going to happen in a half-hour&#x27;s time,&quot; because of her past illnesses, she knew &quot;I was able to accept this, and survive it.&quot; By accepting death, she felt that &quot;they would not win anything. They&#x27;ll have a dead body, useless to them. They won&#x27;t have me. I won&#x27;t let them have me.&quot; She described it as a &quot;kind of bargaining.&quot;

The Germans generally found persons of the prisoners&#x27; own nationality to carry out the torture, she later recalled, so that one &quot;could not say they were tortured by the Germans.&quot; Her torture was carried out by a &quot;very good-looking young Frenchman&quot; who she believed was mentally ill.

==After the war==
Sansom testified against the prison guards charged with war crimes at the 1946 Hamburg Ravensbrück Trials, which resulted in Suhren&#x27;s execution in 1950.
Roy and Odette&#x27;s marriage was dissolved in 1946 and she married Peter Churchill in 1947.

In 1951, her home was burgled and the George Cross stolen. After an appeal by her mother, it was returned with a note saying: &quot;You, Madame, appear to be a dear old lady. God bless you and your children. I thank you for having faith in me. I am not all that bad — it&#x27;s just circumstances. Your little dog really loves me. I gave him a nice pat and left him a piece of meat — out of fridge. Sincerely yours, A Bad Egg.&quot; In 1955, she co-founded the annual Women of the Year Lunch with Tony Lothian and Lady Georgina Coleridge (journalist and daughter of the Marquess of Tweeddale).

She was divorced from Churchill in 1955 and married Geoffrey Hallowes, a former SOE officer, in 1956.

She died on 13 March 1995 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England, aged 82.

== Post war ==
Sansom, known as Odette Churchill after her marriage, gained considerable fame after the publication of a 1949 biography and a film on her war work and prison ordeal in 1950. She became what one biographer described as a &quot;celebrated heroine on both sides of the Channel.&quot; However, her story was not without controversy. Some officials did not believe her story and cast doubt upon her integrity.

She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire and was the first of three Second World War First Aid Nursing Yeomanry members to be awarded the George Cross (gazetted 20 August 1946), all for work with the SOE. She remains the only woman to have received the George Cross while alive, all other female awards to date being posthumous. She was also appointed a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur for her work with the French Resistance.

Documents disclosed long after the war indicate that her superiors had to fight for Sansom&#x27;s George Cross, because she was unable to prove that she had been tortured by the Nazis and that she had not betrayed her fellow agents. The medal was awarded after medical records and eyewitness testimony supported her case.

Her wartime record was the subject of a 1950 film, &quot;Odette&quot;, in which the title role was played by Anna Neagle and Trevor Howard played Churchill. Buckmaster played himself in the film, and Sansom, then known as Odette Churchill, wrote a personal message that appeared at the end of the film, which was well received. Odette Churchill had opposed making the film in Hollywood, for fear that the film would be fictionalised. The fame that the movie brought to Odette Sansom and Peter Churchill also brought criticism from their former associates in SOE and the French Resistance. A manifesto signed by about 20 former associates accused Churchill of being in France only to collect material for a book about his experiences and asked what acts of sabotage he and Odette had carried out.

She served as a technical advisor on a film on her fellow SOE agent Violette Szabo, &quot;Carve Her Name with Pride&quot;.

== Legacy ==

On 23 February 2012, the Royal Mail released a postage stamp featuring Hallowes as part of its &quot;Britons of Distinction&quot; series.

On 6 March 2020 Great Western Railway named a train after her; the ceremony in Odette&#x27;s honour was held at Paddington Station in London and attended by Anne, Princess Royal.

<text>The New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition was an international exhibition held in Dunedin, New Zealand from 26 November 1889 to 19 April 1890. A previous exhibition had been held in 1865, the first world&#x27;s fair in New Zealand, and a later exhibition opened in 1925.

==Organization==
D. H. Hasting proposed the hosting of an international exhibition in Dunedin, New Zealand, to celebrate the golden jubilee in 1890 of the proclamation of British sovereignty over New Zealand in 1840. A meeting was held on 25 October 1888 to form an organizing committee. John Roberts was elected president and Richard Twopeny, executive commissioner. Alfred Lee Smith was one of the directors of the exhibition. The national government officially recognized the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition, and granted £10,000 for its organization.
==Architecture==
A site of about 121 acres was donated by the Otago Harbour Board, bounded by Crawford, Anderson&#x27;s Bay, Cumberland, and Jervois Streets. The main building was designed by James Hislop and built by contractors McMath and Walker of Invercargill. The building consisted of several annexes and halls forming an irregular quadrilateral with its longest side measuring 1,162 feet and a total width of 465 feet. A huge dome 50 feet in diameter rose 80 feet above the main entrance and was covered in eight tons of lead. 

The main building was described as being of Moorish design. Inside, there were large arches draped with velvet curtains and bordered by wooden spandrels decorated with New Zealand ferns and flowers, mirrors and baskets of flowers, and a multi-coloured decorated ceiling. Friezes above the arches were decorated with inspiring mottoes on gold backgrounds: &quot;Fax mentis incendium gloriæ&quot; (Glory is the torch of the mind); &quot;Forti omne solum patria&quot; (The man of courage makes every land his home); &quot;Virtutem sequitur gloria&quot; (Merit wins credit); and &quot;Labor omnia vincit improbus&quot; (Incessant toil conquers all). A statue of Queen Victoria stood on a pedestal directly under the dome.

==The exhibition==
The exhibition was opened on 26 November 1889 by Governor Lord Onslow. The fair celebrated industry and products from New Zealand and overseas. Places represented included Mauritius, Canada, Costa Rica, United States, Ceylon, Japan, Syria, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Cook Islands, Fiji, Hawaii, New Guinea, New Hebrides, New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, Samoa, Solomon Islands, South Australia, Tonga, Victoria, and Western Australia.

Exhibitions included &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s Eiffel Tower&quot;, a wooden structure built by the Austral Otis Elevator Company, based on the newly-erected Eiffel Tower in Paris. The tower was estimated to cost £1200. An elevator ascended about 30 m up the tower, and there were four landings where people could alight. The elevator could carry 16 people at a time, for a fee of sixpence per adult. A smaller Eiffel Tower about 12 m (40 ft) high, without an elevator, was situated in an adjacent garden area near the internal courtyard of the exhibition. It was used for displaying whisky. Another very popular attraction was the switchback railway, similar to a roller coaster, which swooped up and down inclines on a 122-metre long (400 ft ) track. At the &#x27;Anthropometrical Laboratory&#x27;, visitors could have tests such as lung capacity, eyesight, and strength and have their body measurements analysed.

There was an attendance of 625,248 during the 125 days the exhibition was open, before it closed on 19 April 1890. The exhibition made a profit of almost £900, which was distributed amongst the shareholders of the organising body, the New Zealand Exhibition Company.

After the exhibition closed, the various buildings and fittings were sold off or demolished and the site was cleared. One of the last existing sections of the exhibition was an octagonal tower, made of timber and corrugated iron, which was sold and removed to a farm at Kuri Bush near Dunedin. It was used for many years as housing for cows and chickens and as a hay barn, gradually becoming more decayed. The structure collapsed in strong winds in November 2015.

John Roberts was awarded the Companionship of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1891 for his services as president of the exhibition.

A book was published on the occasion of the exhibition, titled &quot;Picturesque Dunedin&quot;. It was edited by Alexander Bathgate, and gave a description of Dunedin and its neighbourhood, with a short historical account of the city and its principal institutions.

<doc id="220919" wikidata="Q1305241" url="?curid=220919" title="Encapsulation (computer programming)">
<text>In software systems, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the mechanisms or methods that operate on the data. It may also refer to the limiting of direct access to some of that data, such as an object&#x27;s components. Essentially, encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object.

Encapsulation allows developers to present a consistent interface that is independent of its internal implementation. As one example, encapsulation can be used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class. This prevents clients from directly accessing this information in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.

Encapsulation also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers. Encapsulation is a technique that encourages decoupling.

All object-oriented programming (OOP) systems support encapsulation, but encapsulation is not unique to OOP. Implementations of abstract data types, modules, and libraries also offer encapsulation. The similarity has been explained by programming language theorists in terms of existential types.

== Meaning ==
In object-oriented programming languages, and other related fields, encapsulation refers to one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination thereof:

* A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object&#x27;s components.
* A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on those data.

Some programming language researchers and academics use the first meaning alone or in combination with the second as a distinguishing feature of object-oriented programming, while some programming languages that provide lexical closures view encapsulation as a feature of the language orthogonal to object orientation.

The second definition reflects that in many object-oriented languages, and other related fields, the components are not hidden automatically and this can be overridden. Thus, information hiding is defined as a separate notion by those who prefer the second definition.

The features of encapsulation are supported using classes in most object-oriented languages, although other alternatives also exist.

Encapsulation may also refer to containing a repetitive or complex process in a single unit to be invoked. Object-oriented programming facilitate this at both the method and class levels. This definition is also applicable to procedural programming.

=== Encapsulation and inheritance ===
The authors of &quot;Design Patterns&quot; discuss the tension between inheritance and encapsulation at length and state that in their experience, designers overuse inheritance. They claim that inheritance often breaks encapsulation, given that inheritance exposes a subclass to the details of its parent&#x27;s implementation. As described by the yo-yo problem, overuse of inheritance and therefore encapsulation, can become too complicated and hard to debug.

== Information hiding == 

Under the definition that encapsulation &quot;can be used to hide data members and member functions&quot;, the internal representation of an object is generally hidden outside of the object&#x27;s definition. Typically, only the object&#x27;s own methods can directly inspect or manipulate its fields. Hiding the internals of the object protects its integrity by preventing users from setting the internal data of the component into an invalid or inconsistent state. A supposed benefit of encapsulation is that it can reduce system complexity, and thus increase robustness, by allowing the developer to limit the interdependencies between software components.

Some languages like Smalltalk and Ruby only allow access via object methods, but most others (e.g., C++, C#, Delphi or Java) offer the programmer some control over what is hidden, typically via keywords like codice_1 and codice_2. ISO C++ standard refers to codice_3, codice_2 and codice_1 as &quot;access specifiers&quot; and that they do not &quot;hide any information&quot;. Information hiding is accomplished by furnishing a compiled version of the source code that is interfaced via a header file.

Almost always, there is a way to override such protection – usually via reflection API (Ruby, Java, C#, etc.), sometimes by mechanism like name mangling (Python), or special keyword usage like codice_6 in C++. Systems that provide object-level capability-based security (adhering to the object-capability model) are an exception, and guarantee strong encapsulation.

=== Examples ===
==== Restricting data fields ====
Languages like C++, C#, Java, PHP, Swift, and Delphi offer ways to restrict access to data fields.

Below is an example in C# that shows how access to a data field can be restricted through the use of a codice_2 keyword:

class Program
 public class Account
 private decimal _accountBalance = 500.00m;

 public decimal CheckBalance()
 return _accountBalance;
 }

 static void Main()
 Account myAccount = new Account();
 decimal myBalance = myAccount.CheckBalance();

 /* This Main method can check the balance via the public
 * &quot;CheckBalance&quot; method provided by the &quot;Account&quot; class 
 * but it cannot manipulate the value of &quot;accountBalance&quot; */
}
Below is an example in Java:
public class Employee {
 private BigDecimal salary = new BigDecimal(50000.00);
 public BigDecimal getSalary() {
 return this.salary;

 public static void main() {
 Employee e = new Employee();
 BigDecimal sal = e.getSalary();
}

Encapsulation is also possible in non-object-oriented languages. In C, for example, a structure can be declared in the public API via the header file for a set of functions that operate on an item of data containing data members that are not accessible to clients of the API with the codice_8 keyword.

// Header file &quot;api.h&quot;

struct Entity; // Opaque structure with hidden members

// API functions that operate on &#x27;Entity&#x27; objects
extern struct Entity * open_entity(int id);
extern int process_entity(struct Entity *info);
extern void close_entity(struct Entity *info);
// extern keywords here are redundant, but don&#x27;t hurt.
// extern defines functions that can be called outside the current file, the default behavior even without the keyword
Clients call the API functions to allocate, operate on, and deallocate objects of an opaque data type. The contents of this type are known and accessible only to the implementation of the API functions; clients cannot directly access its contents. The source code for these functions defines the actual contents of the structure:

// Implementation file &quot;api.c&quot;

#include &quot;api.h&quot;

struct Entity {
 int ent_id; // ID number
 char ent_name[20]; // Name
 ... and other members ...

// API function implementations
struct Entity * open_entity(int id)

int process_entity(struct Entity *info)

void close_entity(struct Entity *info)


==== Name mangling ====

Below is an example of Python, which does not support variable access restrictions. However, the convention is that a variable whose name is prefixed by an underscore should be considered private.
class Car: 
 def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
 self._maxspeed = 200
 def drive(self) -&gt; None:
 print(f&quot;Maximum speed is {self._maxspeed}.&quot;)
redcar = Car()
redcar.drive() # This will print &#x27;Maximum speed is 200.&#x27;

redcar._maxspeed = 10
redcar.drive() # This will print &#x27;Maximum speed is 10.&#x27;

<text>Hee-seop Choi (; ; ; born March 16, 1979) is a South Korean former professional baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, Florida Marlins, and Los Angeles Dodgers and in the KBO League for the Kia Tigers. He was the first Korean-born position player to play in the major leagues.

==Early life and amateur career==
Choi was born in Yeongam County, South Jeolla Province, South Korea on March 19, 1979. He graduated from Gwangju Jeil High School in Gwangju, South Korea, in 1998. He attended Korea University in 1998 and was a member of the South Korea national baseball team that finished second in the 1998 Baseball World Cup. He was scouted and signed by Leon Lee, the father of former major league first baseman Derrek Lee. Coincidentally, he later was traded to the Marlins for Lee.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Cubs===
Beginning in , Choi spent four seasons in the Cubs minor league system and was considered to be one of the organization&#x27;s top prospects. On September 3, 2002, Choi made his Major League debut against the Milwaukee Brewers and became the first Korean-born position player to play in the Major Leagues.

In , Choi played in 80 games, hitting .218 with eight home runs and 28 RBI. He was the Opening Day starter for the Cubs, but suffered a concussion following a collision with teammate pitcher Kerry Wood on June 7, 2003. Choi went on the disabled list, and never reclaimed his starting role. After the season, he was traded to the Florida Marlins for Derrek Lee.

===Florida Marlins===
With his new team, Choi began the season impressively batting .295 with nine home runs and 18 RBIs in April. But his stay with the Marlins was a brief one. On July 30, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with Brad Penny and minor league pitcher Bill Murphy for Paul Lo Duca, Guillermo Mota, and Juan Encarnación.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Choi went on to bat only .161 for the remainder of the 2004 season with the Dodgers, leading many to criticize the Dodgers&#x27; sabermetrician general manager Paul DePodesta for acquiring him. Sabermetric baseball analysts claimed that Choi did not get enough playing time because of bias from the Dodgers&#x27; old school managerial style, which kept rookies on the bench for extended periods of time. Jim Tracy reportedly said that he did not start Choi on one particular day because Adam Eaton was pitching and Eaton has a unique arm angle in his pitching delivery.

Choi&#x27;s production picked up during the 2005 season as he played in 133 games that season and posted a .253 batting average, while hitting 15 home runs and driving in 42 runs. The highlight of Choi&#x27;s season came during a weekend series against the Minnesota Twins from June 10–12, when he accomplished the rare feat of hitting six home runs in a three-game series.

However, during the – off-season, DePodesta was fired by Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, and new general manager Ned Colletti signed Nomar Garciaparra to be the everyday first baseman. Rather than keep Choi on the bench or blocking prospect James Loney&#x27;s path to the big leagues, Colletti decided to waive Choi during spring training; he was subsequently claimed by the Boston Red Sox.

===Post-Dodgers===
Choi represented South Korea in the World Baseball Classic, in which his most significant contribution was hitting a three-run pinch-hit home run against Team USA.

Choi spent the entire 2006 season with Pawtucket. He was designated for assignment August 1, 2006, while on Pawtucket&#x27;s disabled list and removed from Boston&#x27;s 40-man roster. Choi cleared waivers on August 11, 2006, and was outrighted to Pawtucket.

On December 1, 2006, Choi signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays where he was given a shot to be Tampa Bay&#x27;s everyday first baseman. Choi decided to return home after failing to make Tampa Bay&#x27;s 40-man roster after spring training.

===Kia Tigers===
On May 14, , Choi signed with the Kia Tigers in the Korea Baseball Organization. In his KBO debut game, He went 0-for-5 against the Doosan Bears. Choi finished his first KBO season with a .337 batting average, 7 home runs and 45 RBI, playing in 52 games.

Choi began the season in a slump due to a waist injury, finishing the month of April with a batting average of just .208 and going 25-for-120 to close out the month, and was then demoted to the Korean minor league affiliate of the Kia Tigers. In July, he returned to the 26-man first-team roster, but finished the season with disappointing offensive numbers, batting .229 with only 6 home runs and 22 RBI.

In , Choi broke out offensively and became a star, rebounding from his subpar year. He helped lift the Tigers into title contention, batting .308, blasting a pro career-best 33 home runs, leading the KBO league in runs with 98 and helping them win the 2009 KBO regular season. Choi was the runner-up in home runs (33), RBI (100), and walks (103), 4th in slugging percentage (.589), 6th in on-base percentage (.435), and 11th in batting average (.308). Choi and Kim Sang-hyeon hit 69 home runs, and the two together were called the &quot;CK Cannon&quot;.

On December 11, 2009, he obtained his first KBO League Golden Glove Award nomination for his play at 1st base.

In , Choi had a .286 batting average, with 21 home runs, 84 RBIs, and drew 81 walks. Choi received an all-star selection and also participated in the home run derby, where he set the record for longest home run.

In , Choi was limited to 70 games due to injury. He hit .281, with 9 home runs and 37 RBI.

In , Choi hit .252, with 7 home runs and 42 RBI in another injury-plagued season.

In , Choi hit .258, with 11 home runs and 42 RBI. After the season, he underwent knee surgery.

<doc id="220950" wikidata="Q217172" url="?curid=220950" title="Gulf Cooperation Council">
<text>The Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (), also known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; ), is a regional, intergovernmental, political, and economic union comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The council&#x27;s main headquarters is located in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The Charter of the GCC was signed on 25 May 1981, formally establishing the institution.

All current member states are monarchies, including three constitutional monarchies (Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain), two absolute monarchies (Saudi Arabia and Oman), and one federal monarchy (the United Arab Emirates, which is composed of seven member states, each of which is an absolute monarchy with its own emir). There have been discussions regarding the future membership of Jordan, Morocco, and Yemen.

During the Arab Spring in 2012, Saudi Arabia proposed to transform the GCC into a &quot;Gulf Union&quot; with tighter economic, political and military coordination, a move considered to be intended to counterbalance Iranian influence in the region, however objections were raised by other countries. In 2014, Bahraini prime minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa said that current events in the region highlighted the importance of the proposal. The Peninsula Shield Force is the military arm of the GCC, formed in 1984.

==History and founding==
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah of Kuwait, alongside the support of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the UAE, played a crucial role in fostering the idea of closer cooperation among the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, laying the groundwork for the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council. 
The members&#x27; shared vision for regional unity, security, and economic integration led to the official establishment of the GCC in 1981, strengthening the collective power and influence of the Gulf countries.

The charter was signed in Arabic in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on 21 Rajab 1401 on the Islamic calendar (corresponding to 25 May 1981 on the Gregorian calendar).

The signatory states on the founding document are the only current members of the GCC.

An economic agreement between the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council was signed on 11 November 1981 in Abu Dhabi, UAE. These countries are often referred to as &quot;the GCC states&quot;.

===Objectives===
In 2001, the GCC Supreme Council set the following goals:
* Customs union in January 2003.
* Common market by 2007
* Common currency by 2010

Oman announced in December 2006 that it would not be able to meet the 2010 target date for a common currency. Following the announcement that the central bank for the monetary union would be located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, rather than in the UAE, they announced their withdrawal from the monetary union project in May 2009. The name Khaleeji has been proposed as a name for this currency. If realized, the GCC monetary union would be the second-largest supranational monetary union in the world, measured by the GDP of the common-currency area.

Other stated objectives include:
* Formulating similar regulations in various fields such as religion, finance, trade, customs, tourism, legislation, and administration.
* Fostering scientific and technical progress in industry, mining, agriculture, water, and animal resources.
* Establishing scientific research centers.
* Setting up joint ventures.
* Unified military (Peninsula Shield Force).
* Encouraging cooperation of the private sector.
* Strengthening ties between their people.
The area has some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, mostly due to a boom in oil and natural gas revenues coupled with a building and investment boom backed by decades of saved petroleum revenues. In an effort to build a tax base and economic foundation before the reserves run out, the UAE&#x27;s investment arms, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, retain over US$900 billion in assets. Other regional funds have several hundreds of billions of dollars of assets under management.

The region is an emerging hotspot for events, including the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar. Doha also submitted an unsuccessful application for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Qatar would later host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Recovery plans have been criticized for crowding out the private sector, failing to set clear priorities for growth, failing to restore weak consumer and investor confidence, and undermining long-term stability.

===Logo===
The logo of the GCC consists of two concentric circles. On the upper part of the larger circle, the phrase Bismillah - &quot;in the name of God&quot; - is written in Arabic, and on the lower part of the circle is written the council&#x27;s full name. The inner-circle contains an embossed hexagonal shape representing the six countries. The inside of the hexagon shows a map encompassing the Arabian Peninsula, on which the areas of the member countries are colored in brown, borderless.

==Economy==
===Internal market===
A common market was launched on 1 January 2008, easing movement of goods and services, with plans to create a fully integrated single market. Implementation later lagged behind, after the 2009 financial crisis. The creation of a customs union began in 2003, and was completed and fully operational by 1 January 2015. In January 2015, the common market was also further integrated, covering full equality among GCC citizens to work in government and private sectors, the ability to access social insurance and retirement coverage, real estate ownership rights, capital movement, and access to education, health and other social services, in all member states. However, some barriers remained in the free movement of goods and services. The coordination of taxation systems, accounting standards and civil legislation is currently in progress. The interoperability of professional qualifications, insurance certificates and identity documents is also underway.

===Monetary union===
In 2014, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia took major steps to ensure the creation of a single currency. Kuwait&#x27;s finance minister said the four members are pushing ahead with the monetary union but said some &quot;technical points&quot; need to be cleared. He added, &quot;A common market and common central bank would also position the GCC as one entity that would have great influence on the international financial system&quot;. The implementation of a single currency and the creation of a central bank is overseen by the Monetary Council.

There is currently a degree to which a nominal GCC single currency already exists. Businesses trade using a basket of GCC currencies, just as before the Euro was introduced, the European Currency Unit (ECU) had been used as a nominal medium of exchange. Plans to introduce a single currency had been drawn up as far back as 2009, however due to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and political differences, the UAE and Oman withdrew their membership.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
Companies and investors from GCC countries are active in mergers and acquisitions. Since 1999, more than 5,200 transactions with a known value of US$573 billion had been announced. Investors include a number of sovereign wealth funds.

===Infrastructure===
The GCC launched common economic projects to promote and facilitate integration and to increase resilency. The GCC Interconnection Grid connects the power grids of member states. In 2009, it initiated operations and by 2013, all six members were connected. A water interconnection project has been discussed but, as of January 2023, there have been no notable developments. Unlike other leading aviation regions like the European Union, members have not agreed to an open skies policy. As such, GCC airlines do not have unlimited market access rights to member states and compete to capture international air traffic flows.

The GCC has also launched major rail projects to connect the peninsula. The railways are expected to fuel intra-regional trade while helping reduce fuel consumption. Over US$200 billion will be invested to develop about of rail network across the GCC, according to Oman&#x27;s Minister of Transport and Communications. According to Ramiz Al Assar, Resident World Bank advisor for the GCC, it will link the six member states as a regional transport corridor, further integrating with the national railway projects, deepening economic social and political integration, and it is developed from a sustainable perspective.

The project, estimated to be worth $15.5 billion, was scheduled to be completed by 2021. As of May 2022, railway construction UAE and Saudi Arabia have progressed significantly, but other members&#x27; efforts have lagged. Saudi Arabian Railways, Etihad Rail, and their respective national governments have invested 15 billion dollars as of early 2015 into railway infrastructure to create rail networks for transporting freight, connecting cities, and reducing transport times.

In the banking industry of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), diversity is increasingly recognized as a strategic asset that goes beyond mere corporate social responsibility. This shift towards embracing a diverse workforce is driven by the recognition that varied perspectives and experiences spur innovation, improve decision-making, and expand market reach in the fast-paced world of finance, increasing market share and profitability.

==Free trade agreements==
The Gulf Cooperation Council has free trade agreements with the following countries:

==Politics and governance==

===Supreme Council===
The GCC Supreme Council is composed of the heads of state of the member states. It is the highest decision-making entity of the GCC, setting its vision and goals. Decisions on important issues require unanimous approval, while issues on procedural matters require a majority. Each member state has one vote. The presidency rotates based on the Arabic alphabetical order of the names of the member states.

===Ministerial Council===
The Ministerial Council is composed of the Foreign Ministers of all the member states. It convenes every three months. It formulates policies, and makes recommendations to promote cooperation and achieve coordination among the member states, when implementing ongoing projects. Decisions are submitted in the form of recommendations, which the Supreme Council can approve. The Ministerial Council is also responsible for preparations of meetings of the Supreme Council and its agenda. The voting procedure in the Ministerial Council is the same as in the Supreme Council.

===Secretariat General===
The Secretariat is the executive arm of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It takes decisions within its authority, and implements decisions approved by the Supreme or Ministerial Council. The Secretariat also compiles studies relating to cooperation, coordination, and planning for common actions, and occasionally releases reports regarding the work done by the GCC as a whole, and the implementation of its own decisions. The current Secretary-General is Nayef Falah Mubarak Al Hajraf, and his deputies include Abdulaziz Al Auwaishig and Khalifa Alfadhel.

===Monetary Council===
On 15 December 2009, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia announced the creation of a Monetary Council, to introduce a single currency for the union. The board of the council, which set a timetable and action plan for establishing a central bank and chose a currency regime, met for the first time on 30 March 2010. Kuwaiti foreign minister Mohammad Sabah Al-Sabah said on 8 December 2009 that a single currency may take up to ten years to establish. Oman and the UAE later announced their withdrawal from the proposed currency.

In 2014, major moves were taken to ensure the launch of a single currency. Kuwait&#x27;s finance minister stated that a currency should be implemented without delay. Negotiations with the UAE and Oman to expand the monetary union were renewed.

===Patent Office===

The GCC Patent Office was approved in 1992, and established soon after in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Applications are filed and prosecuted in the Arabic language before it and grants patents valid in all GCC member states, but is a separate office from the Saudi Arabian Patent Office. The first GCC patent was granted in 2002. As of 2013, it employed about 30 patent examiners.

===Peninsula Shield Force===
Amidst the Bahraini uprising, Saudi Arabia and the UAE sent ground troops to Bahrain in order to protect vital infrastructure such as the airport and highway system. Kuwait and Oman refrained from sending troops. Instead, Kuwait sent a navy unit.

The secretary-general of the GCC strongly endorsed the use of international force in Libya. GCC member states joined coalition efforts to enforce the no-fly zone.

In September 2014, GCC members Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE and Qatar, and pending member Jordan commenced air operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, however, are among the states that oppose the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, whereas Qatar has historically supported it. They also pledged other support including operating training facilities for Syrian rebels, in Saudi Arabia, and allowing the use of their airbases by other countries fighting ISIL. Some GCC countries also send some troops to fight the opposition government in Yemen.

===GCC Standardization Organization===
The GCC Standardization Organization is the standardization organization of the GCC. Yemen is also a member of the GCC Standardization Organization.

===Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting===
The Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC) was founded in 1976 by the six GCC member states; Yemen joined the organization in 2009. It is headquartered at Doha, Qatar. The organization chart of GOIC includes the board members and the General Secretariat. The Board is formed by member state representatives appointed by their governments.

==Secretaries-General==
==Member states==
There are six member states of the union:

===Associated members===
The associate membership of Iraq in certain GCC-related institutions was cancelled after the invasion of Kuwait.

Yemen was in negotiations for GCC membership in 2007, and hoped to join by 2016. Yemen is already a member of the GCC Standardization Authority, the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC), the GCC Auditing and Accounting Authority, the Gulf Radio and TV Authority, the GCC Council of Health Ministers, the GCC Education and Training Bureau, the GCC Council of Labour &amp; and Social Affairs Ministers, and The Gulf Cup Football Tournament. The Council issued directives that all the necessary legal measures be taken, so that Yemen would have the same rights and obligations of GCC member states in those institutions.

==Sports==

The union has served as a grouping for sports co-operation and competition. The GCC states have an annual meeting of the Youth and Sports Ministers of each state to boost youth and sports initiatives in the region. The promotion of the hosting of international sports events has also served an economic purpose for the union&#x27;s countries, leading to investment and development in the region.

The GCC Games, a quadrennial multi-sport event, was established by the union and first held in 2011. There are numerous long-running GCC Championships for individual sports, including: the Gulf Cooperation Council Athletics Championships (first held in 1986; youth section from 2000) sailing, basketball, swimming, tennis, gymnastics (senior and youth levels), weightlifting, futsal, snooker, and table tennis.

==2014 Qatar–Saudi diplomatic conflict==
Qatar&#x27;s support for the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region, Hamas and radical Islamists in Libya, has led to increasing tensions with other Arab states of the Persian Gulf. These tensions came to a head during a March 2014 meeting of the GCC, after which the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain recalled their ambassadors to Qatar.

Some financial economists have interpreted the 2014 Saudi–Qatari rift as a tangible political sign of a growing economic rivalry between oil and natural gas producers, which could &quot;have deep and long-lasting consequences&quot; beyond MENA.

==2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis==

On 5 June 2017, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt had officially cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia said it took the decision to cut diplomatic ties due to Qatar&#x27;s &quot;embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region&quot;, including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaeda, ISIL and Iran-supported groups in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s eastern province of Qatif. Political researcher Islam Hassan viewed this rift as a continuation of Qatar&#x27;s foreign policy rivalry with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain put a ban on Qataris and their businesses. Qataris were not allowed to enter or live in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, or Bahrain, unless they had a spouse living there, in which case they were required to carry a visa in order to enter these countries. Qatar Airways aircraft were not allowed to fly over these countries. Saudi Arabia stated that they would turn its land border with Qatar into a canal, known as the Salwa Canal, in 2018. The plan was abandoned in 2019.

On 4 January 2021, Kuwait National TV announced that Saudi Arabia would restore all diplomatic ties with Qatar, reopen air space to Qatari aircraft and reopen the Qatar–Saudi land border.

Later that evening, it was announced that Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt agreed to restore ties with Qatar. On 4 January 2021, it was made official at the Al-Ula summit, where the blockading countries, along with Qatar, signed an official agreement and ended the rift after three years and seven months.

===GCC—Pakistan relations===
In January 2022, the GCC and Pakistan finalised the Joint Action Plan for Strategic Dialogue (2022–26). In September 2023, the GCC and Pakistan 
signed a preliminary deal on a free trade agreement.

===GCC and EU Summit meetings===
On 16 October 2024, the first GCC and the European Union summit was held in Brussels, Belgium. It was co-chaired by Charles Michel and the rotating GCC President Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, under the theme &quot;Strategic Partnership for Peace and Prosperity&quot;. The Human Rights Watch requested the EU to take advantage of the first summit with Gulf leaders, and challenge the involvement of the UAE and other neighbouring states in the Sudan civil war. The EU director for HRW, Phillippe Dam said the union leaders should &quot;publicly press&quot; the UAE to stop arms supply to the RSF and push the militia to end the war.

==Related states==
Since the creation of the council in 1981 its membership has not expanded, with all members being Arab monarchies.

Some GCC countries have land borders with Iraq, Jordan or Yemen, and sea borders with Iran, Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea or Somalia.

===Egypt===
Only the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt lies in the Arabian Peninsula. In 2011, Bahrain&#x27;s Foreign Minister called for Egypt to be admitted as a member of the GCC.

===Iraq===
Iraq, despite having territory in the Arabian Peninsula and bordering the Persian Gulf, is the only Arab country bordering the gulf that is not a member of the GCC. Despite the societal, political differences between Iraq and its neighboring Gulf states, in 2012, former Iraqi Defence Minister Saadoun al-Dulaimi stated that Iraq wanted to join the GCC. Kuwait supported Iraq joining the GCC, however no progress has been made.

===Iran===
At the December 2012 Manama summit, the GCC states called for an end to Iranian interference in their internal affairs.

===Jordan and Morocco===
In May 2011, Jordan&#x27;s request to join the GCC, which had been first submitted 15 years earlier, was accepted and Morocco was invited to join the union. In September 2011, a five-year economic plan for both countries was put forward after a meeting between the foreign ministers of both countries and those of the GCC states. Although a plan for accession was being looked into, it was noted that there was no timetable for either&#x27;s accession, and that discussions would continue.

As Jordan and Morocco are the only two Arabic-speaking monarchies not currently in the council, the current members see them as strong potential allies. Jordan borders Saudi Arabia and is economically connected to the Arab Gulf States. Although Morocco is not near the Persian Gulf, the Moroccan foreign minister Taieb Fassi Fihri notes that &quot;geographical distance is no obstacle to a strong relationship&quot;.

===Yemen===
Yemen was in negotiations for GCC membership, and hoped to join by 2016. Although it has no coastline on the Persian Gulf, Yemen lies in the Arabian Peninsula.

==Related organizations==

The GCC members and Yemen are also members of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA). However, this is unlikely to affect the agenda of the GCC significantly as it has a more aggressive timetable than GAFTA and is seeking greater integration.

<text>Johann Nepomuk Maelzel (or Mälzel; August 15, 1772 – July 21, 1838) was a German inventor, engineer, and showman, best known for manufacturing a metronome and several music-playing automatons, and displaying a fraudulent chess machine. He worked with Beethoven to compose a piece of music for one of his inventions.

==Life and work==
Maelzel was born in Regensburg. The son of an organ builder, he received a comprehensive musical education. He moved to Vienna in 1792.
After several years of study and experiment, he produced an orchestrion instrument, which was publicly exhibited, and afterward sold for 3,000 florins. In 1804, he invented the panharmonicon, an automaton able to play the musical instruments of a military band, powered by bellows and directed by revolving cylinders storing the notes. This attracted universal attention; the inventor became noted throughout Europe, was appointed imperial court-mechanician at Vienna, and drew the admiration of Ludwig van Beethoven and other noted composers. This instrument was sold to a Parisian admirer for 120,000 francs.
In 1805 Maelzel purchased Wolfgang von Kempelen&#x27;s half-forgotten automaton chess player, The Turk, took it to Paris, and sold it to Eugene Beauharnais at a large profit. Returning to Vienna, he gave his attention to the construction of an automaton trumpeter, which, with lifelike movements and sudden changes of attire, performed French and Austrian field signals and military airs. In 1808 he invented an improved ear trumpet, and a musical chronometer.

In 1813 Maelzel and Beethoven were on familiar terms. Maelzel conceived and musically sketched &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot;, or &quot;The Battle of Vitoria&quot; for which Beethoven composed the music to be played on Maelzel&#x27;s &#x27;mechanical orchestra&#x27;, the panharmonicon; they also gave several concerts, at which Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies were interspersed with the performances of Maelzel&#x27;s automatons. 
In 1814, Beethoven wrote a deposition claiming that Maelzel had defrauded him, claiming ownership of this music, and illegally staging performances of it from an inaccurate transcription. Beethoven described Maelzel in this deposition as &quot;a rude, churlish man, entirely devoid of education or cultivation&quot;.

In 1816 Maelzel became established in Paris as manufacturer of a metronome. Maelzel&#x27;s metronome was copied from a metronome invented earlier by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel. By 1817, Beethoven and Maelzel appear to have reconciled. Beethoven wrote glowingly of Maelzel&#x27;s metronome and declared he would stop using traditional tempo indications like allegro.

In 1817 Maelzel left Paris for Munich, and then again took up his abode in Vienna. At this time he found means to repurchase von Kempelen&#x27;s chess player, and, after spending several preparatory years in constructing and improving a number of mechanical inventions, he formed an enterprise devoted to exhibiting his array of mechanical wonders in the New World.

He died on a ship in the harbor of La Guaira, Venezuela, reportedly from alcohol poisoning.

==Quotations==
Views on Maelzel show that he was not always positively viewed by his contemporaries (e.g. regarding his relation to Art).
*&quot;Maelzel will be especially remembered [...] by the Metronome. [...]As a man, Maelzel seems to have been quarrelsome, extravagant, and unscrupulous. [...] Had he possessed a larger amount of culture and of conscience, he might have done service to high Art.&quot;
::— &quot;The Year-book of facts in science and art (1856)&quot;

<doc id="220964" wikidata="Q460674" url="?curid=220964" title="Ska punk">
<text>Ska punk (also spelled ska-punk) is a fusion genre that mixes ska music and punk rock music. Ska punk tends to feature brass instruments, especially horns such as trumpets, trombones and woodwind instruments like saxophones, making the genre distinct from other forms of punk rock. It is closely tied to third wave ska which reached its zenith in the mid-1990s.

Before ska punk began, many ska bands and punk rock bands performed on the same bills. Some music groups from the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as the Clash, the Deadbeats, the Specials, the Beat, and Madness fused characteristics of punk rock and ska, but many of these were punk bands playing an occasional ska-flavored song or ska bands with punk influences. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, ska-punk enjoyed its greatest success, heralded by bands such as Fishbone, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sublime, Less Than Jake, and more.

Ska punk had significant mainstream success in the middle-to-late 1990s, with many bands topping pop and rock music charts. The best-selling ska punk record of the era was No Doubt&#x27;s &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 1999 and was certified diamond by Music Canada in 1997. By the early 2000s, many of the bands in ska punk had broken up, and the genre lost mainstream appeal, though it continued to have underground popularity and featured a revival in the late 2010s with bands like the Interrupters returning to chart success, when their song &quot;She&#x27;s Kerosene&quot; reached the top 5 on alternative and rock music charts in Canada and the US, as well as in the early 2020s with hyperpop duo 100 gecs album &quot;10,000 gecs&quot; incorporating elements of ska punk to critical acclaim.

==Characteristics==
Ska punk combines ska music with punk rock music. Ska punk often features wind instruments, especially horns such as saxophones, trombones and trumpets, making the genre distinct from other forms of punk rock. It is similar to traditional Jamaican ska, but faster and heavier.

==History==
===Predecessors and early development (late 1970s, 1980s, early 1990s)===
Before ska punk started, many ska bands and punk rock bands performed on the same bills together and appealed to the same audiences. A ska revival occurred simultaneously around the beginning of British punk rock and the near-simultaneous rebirth of the late 1970s British mod and skinhead movements. During the late 1970s and early 1980s in United Kingdom, many punk rock bands mixed punk rock with ska influences. Pioneering punk rock band the Clash incorporated influences from ska alongside a range of other genres on their seminal 1979 post-punk album &quot;London Calling&quot;. Songs like 1978&#x27;s &quot;Kill the Hippies&quot; by the Deadbeats prominently featured horns, although there are no ska elements. Other British bands that were influenced by both punk rock and ska included the Specials, the Beat and Madness. With both films like the 1981 documentary film &quot;Dance Craze&quot; and supportive radio stations like Los Angeles, California&#x27;s KROQ, ska crossed the Atlantic. During the 1980s, ska punk was underground. However, Fishbone, one of the earliest ska punk bands, achieved moderate success. Other ska punk bands from the 1980s and early 1990s include Operation Ivy, The Toasters, Culture Shock, Voodoo Glow Skulls, the Porkers, Sublime, Citizen Fish, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, the Suicide Machines, MU330 and Dance Hall Crashers.


===Mainstream success (mid–late 1990s)===
Ska punk broke into the mainstream in the mid-1990s with bands such as Sublime, No Doubt, Goldfinger, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Less Than Jake and Rancid all achieving mainstream success. Sublime&#x27;s song &quot;Date Rape&quot; became a hit on major California alternative rock radio stations. However, Sublime did not reach its peak of popularity until 1996 with the release of the band&#x27;s 1996 self-titled album, which was certified 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999. Because of Sublime&#x27;s popularity, the band&#x27;s album &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA in 2005.

Another ska punk band that achieved mainstream success during the mid-late 1990s was No Doubt. No Doubt&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was certified diamond by the RIAA in 1999 and was certified diamond by Music Canada in 1997. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; sold at least 16,000,000 copies worldwide. Rancid&#x27;s song &quot;Time Bomb&quot; peaked at number 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart and the band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA. Reel Big Fish&#x27;s album &quot;Turn the Radio Off&quot;, which was released in August 1996, was certified gold by the RIAA in November 1997. Reel Big Fish&#x27;s song &quot;Sell Out&quot; peaked at number 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart. Goldfinger&#x27;s song &quot;Here in Your Bedroom&quot; peaked at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones achieved mainstream success in 1997; their song &quot;The Impression That I Get&quot; peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart, number 19 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart, and number 17 on the Adult Pop Songs chart. Also, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones&#x27; song &quot;The Rascal King&quot; peaked at number 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones&#x27; album &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot;, which was released in March 1997, was certified platinum by the RIAA in September 1997. In 2000, &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that according to Nielsen SoundScan, &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; sold 1,700,000 copies.

===Decline and revival (2000s–present)===
Ska and reggae influenced rock music retreated to niche status by the first decade of the 2000s, with many major acts, such as the Mighty Mighty Bosstones taking an extended hiatus, and chart success eluded most bands of the genre. Some acts continued to produce such music through the decade, spearheaded by groups from Southern California (the home of ska-punk pioneers Sublime) such as Slightly Stoopid, Long Beach Shortbus, Long Beach Dub Allstars, and Tribal Seeds. Chart success returned in 2018 when the Interrupters scored a minor hit with their song &quot;She&#x27;s Kerosene&quot;, that peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart and No. 1 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian rock/alternative chart. Detroit ska punk outfit the Suicide Machines released a new album titled &quot;Revolution Spring&quot;, released in March 2020 on Fat Wreck Chords. The Planet Smashers released &quot;Too Much Information&quot; on Stomp Records in 2019 and continue to play shows in the U.S. and Canada. The duo 100 gecs incorporated ska punk elements into their 2019 song &quot;Stupid Horse&quot; from their album &quot;1000 Gecs&quot;, as well as throughout their album &quot;10,000 Gecs&quot;, released in 2023.

Ann Arbor, Michigan–based ska punk band We Are the Union released &quot;Self Care&quot; in 2018 and tour frequently. Their trombone player, Jeremy Hunter, runs the YouTube channel called Skatune Network, where they post ska and ska punk covers of video game soundtracks, cartoon themes, pop punk, and other genres, garnering a significant international following online and releasing several albums. &quot;BrooklynVegan&quot; has written, &quot;You can&#x27;t talk about the renewed interest in ska without talking Jeremy Hunter&quot;. Buck-O-Nine released a new album titled: &quot;Fundaymental&quot; in 2019. Other artists that continue to tour or put out music on a regular basis include: Kill Lincoln, Omnigone, Catbite, Big D and the Kids Table, Streetlight Manifesto (and by extension Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution), Five Iron Frenzy, Pilfers, Mad Caddies, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Joystick, Hans Gruber and the Die Hards, Mike Park&#x27;s The Bruce Lee Band, Tape Girl, Poindexter, Noise Complaint, Skatsune Miku, Sad Snack, Monkey, Catbite, Young Costello and the Interrupters.

<text>Anton Raphael Mengs (12 March 1728 – 29 June 1779) was a German Neoclassical painter.

==Early life==

Mengs was born on 12 March 1728, at Ústí nad Labem in the Kingdom of Bohemia, the son of Ismael Mengs, a Danish-born painter who eventually established himself at Dresden, where the court of Saxon-Polish electors and kings was. His older sister, Therese Concordia Maron, was also a painter, as was his younger sister, Julia.

His and Therese&#x27;s births in Bohemia were mere coincidence. Their mother was not their father&#x27;s wife; Ismael carried on a years-long affair with the family&#x27;s housekeeper, Charlotte Bormann. In an effort to conceal the births of two illegitimate children, Ismael took Charlotte, under the pretext of &quot;vacations&quot;, to the nearest bigger town abroad, Ústí nad Labem (90 km upstream of the Elbe river). At least in Anton&#x27;s case, Ismael Mengs took his baby and Charlotte back to Dresden a few weeks after the birth. There they lived for the next 13 years. 

In 1741, Ismael moved his family from Dresden to Rome, where he copied in miniature some works of Raphael for the Elector of Saxony, which were intended for Dresden.

==Adulthood==
In 1749, Anton Raphael Mengs was appointed the first painter to Frederick Augustus, Elector of Saxony, but this did not prevent him from continuing to spend much of his time in Rome. There he married Margarita Guazzi, who had sat for him as a model in 1748. In 1749, Mengs accepted a commission from the Duke of Northumberland to make a copy, in oil on canvas, of Raphael&#x27;s fresco &quot;The School of Athens&quot; for his London home. Executed in 1752–5, Mengs&#x27;s painting is full-sized, but he adapted the composition to a rectangular format and added other figures. It is now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

He converted to Catholicism, and in 1754 he became director of the Vatican painting school. In 1757, Mengs painted a superb fresco on the dome of the church of Sant&#x27;Eusebio in Rome. His fresco painting &quot;Parnassus&quot; at Villa Albani gained him a reputation as a master painter.

On two occasions he accepted invitations from Charles III of Spain to go to Madrid, first in 1761. There he produced some of his best work, most notably the ceiling of the banqueting hall of the Royal Palace of Madrid, the subject of which was the &quot;Triumph of Trajan&quot; and the &quot;Temple of Glory.&quot; After the completion of this work in 1777, Mengs returned to Rome, where he died two years later, in poor circumstances, leaving twenty children, seven of whom were pensioned by the king of Spain. 

Mengs died in Rome in June 1779 and was buried there in the Church of Santi Michele e Magno.

==Career==
His portraits and self-portraits show an attention to detail and insight often lost in his grander paintings. His closeness to Johann Joachim Winckelmann has enhanced his historical importance. Mengs came to share Winckelmann&#x27;s enthusiasm for classical antiquity, and worked to establish the dominance of Neoclassical painting over the then popular Rococo style. At the same time, however, the influence of the Roman Baroque remained strong in his work, particularly in his religious paintings. He would have fancied himself the first neoclassicist, while, in fact, he may be the last flicker of Baroque art. Rudolf Wittkower wrote: &quot;In the last analysis, he is as much an end as a beginning&quot;. Goethe regretted that &quot;so much learning should have been allied to a total want of initiative and poverty of invention, and embodied with a strained and artificial mannerism.&quot;
Mengs had a well-known rivalry with the contemporary Italian painter Pompeo Batoni. He was also a friend of Giacomo Casanova. Casanova provides accounts of his personality and contemporary reputation through anecdotes in his &quot;Histoire de ma vie&quot;. Among his pupils in Italy were Anton von Maron (Antonio Maron; (Vienna, 1731- Naples, 1761). His pupils in Spain included Agustín Esteve, Francisco Bayeu and Mariano Salvador Maella.

Besides numerous paintings in Madrid, the &quot;Ascension&quot; and &quot;St Joseph&quot; at Dresden, &quot;Perseus and Andromeda&quot; at Saint Petersburg, and the ceiling of the Villa Albani are among his chief works. A &quot;Noli me tangere&quot; was commissioned as an altar-piece by All Souls College, Oxford, and is now held in the National Gallery, London. Another altar-piece was installed in Magdalen College, Oxford.

===Theoretical writings===
Mengs wrote about art in Spanish, Italian, and German. He reveals an eclectic theory of art that sees perfection as attainable through a well-balanced fusion of diverse excellences: Greek design combined with the expression of Raphael, the chiaroscuro of Correggio, and the colour of Titian.

<doc id="220967" wikidata="Q622803" url="?curid=220967" title="Zambezia Province">
<text>Zambezia ( ) is the second most-populous province of Mozambique, located in the central coastal region south-west of Nampula Province and north-east of Sofala Province. It has a population of 5.11 million, according to the 2017 census. The provincial capital is Quelimane.

Zambezia has a total area of 103,478 km2. The 2,574 kilometre Zambezi River runs through Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique before emptying into the Indian Ocean off the coast of Zambezia. Mangroves are predominant along the coast and five of the 10 islands archipelago are offshore of the region. Considerable forests can be found inland, with a scattering of estuaries and rivers.

Zambezia&#x27;s islands lie in the Primeiras e Segundas Environmental Protection Area. This string of islands is split into the Primeiras Islands and Segundas Islands (First Islands and Second Islands in Portuguese) and are largely uninhabited, aside from providing a stop-off for local artisanal fishers. At present, only Ilha do Fogo, one of the Primeiras Islands, has infrastructure. It runs solely on clean energy, using solar power, and offers ecotourism retreats.

Agricultural products include rice, maize, cassava, cashews, sugarcane, soybeans, coconuts, citrus, cotton, and tea. The country&#x27;s largest tea estates are at Gurúè, while Lioma is a centre of soybean production. Fishing is especially productive of shrimp, and gemstones are mined at several sites.

Vasco da Gama landed at the site of Quelimane in 1498. Shortly after, the Portuguese established a permanent presence, and many moved up the Zambezi into the interior, for many years the farthest inland European presence (although over time there was much intermarrying, and few residents were of purely Portuguese descent).

==Districts==

Zambezia Province is divided into the 16 districts of:
*Alto Molocue District - with an area of 6,386 km2 and 278,064 people,
*Chinde District - with an area of 4,403 km2 and 121,173 people,
*Gilé District - with an area of 8,875 km2 and 168,962 people,
*Gurué District - with an area of 5,606 km2 and 302,948 people,
*Ile District - with an area of 5,589 km2 and 292,504 people,
*Inhassunge District - with an area of 745 km2 and 91,989 people,
*Lugela District - with an area of 6,178 km2 and 137,040 people,
*Maganja da Costa District - with an area of 7,597 km2 and 282,173 people,
*Milange District - with an area of 9,794 km2 and 515,029 people,
*Mocuba District - with an area of 8,867 km2 and 306,543 people,
*Mopeia District - with an area of 7,614 km2 and 115,614 people,
*Morrumbala District - with an area of 12,972 km2 and 361,896 people,
*Namacurra District - with an area of 1,798 km2 and 179,133 people,
*Namarroi District - with an area of 3,019 km2 and 127,651 people,
*Nicoadala District - with an area of 3,582 km2 and 232,929 people, and
*Pebane District - with an area of 9,985 km2 and 186,330 people.

In addition, there is one municipality - the city of
Quelimane - with an area of 117 km2 and 192,876 population.

The above district populations are from the provisional results of the September 2007 Census.

<text>A gelding is a castrated male horse or other equine, such as a pony, donkey or a mule. The term is also used with certain other animals and livestock, such as domesticated camels. By comparison, the equivalent term for castrated male cattle would be &quot;steer&quot; (or &quot;bullock&quot;), and &quot;wether&quot; for sheep and goats.

Castration allows a male animal to be more calm, better-behaved, less sexually aggressive, and more responsive to training efforts. This makes the animal generally more suitable as an everyday working animal, or as a pet in the case of companion animals. The gerund and participle &quot;gelding&quot; and the infinitive &quot;to geld&quot; refer to the castration procedure itself.

==Etymology==
The verb &quot;to geld&quot; comes from the Old Norse , from the adjective . The noun &quot;gelding&quot; is from the Old Norse .

==History==
The Scythians are thought to have been among the first to geld their horses, as they valued war horses that were quiet and less defensive, as well as easier to keep in groups and less likely to be territorial, without the temptation of reproductive/mating urges. Aristotle is said to have mentioned gelding as early as 350 BC.

==Reasons for gelding==

A male horse is often gelded to make him better-behaved and easier to control. Gelding can also remove lower-quality animals from the gene pool. 
To allow only the finest animals to breed on, while preserving adequate genetic diversity, only a small percentage of all male horses should remain stallions. Mainstream sources place the percentage of stallions that should be kept as breeding stock at about 10%, while an extreme view states that only 0.5% of all males should be bred. In wild herds, the 10% ratio is largely maintained naturally, as a single dominant stallion usually protects and breeds with a herd which is seldom larger than 10 or 12 mares, though he may permit a less dominant junior stallion to live at the fringes of the herd. There are more males than just herd stallions, so unattached male horses group together for protection in small all-male &quot;bachelor herds&quot;, where, in the absence of mares, they tend to behave much like geldings.
Geldings are preferred over stallions for working purposes because they are calmer, easier to handle, and more tractable. Geldings are therefore a favorite for many equestrians. In some horse shows, due to the dangers inherent in handling stallions, which require experienced handlers, youth exhibitors are not permitted to show stallions in classes limited to just those riders.

Geldings are often preferred over mares, because some mares become temperamental when in heat and the use of mares may be limited during the later months of pregnancy and while caring for a young foal.

In horse racing, castrating a stallion may be considered worthwhile if the animal is easily distracted by other horses, difficult to handle, or otherwise not running to his full potential due to behavioral issues. While this means the horse loses any breeding value, a successful track career can often be a boost to the value of the stallion that sired the gelding.

Sometimes a stallion used for breeding is castrated later in life, possibly due to sterility, because the offspring of the stallion are not up to expectations, or simply because the horse is not used much for breeding. Castration may allow a stallion to live peacefully with other horses, allowing a more social and comfortable existence.

Under British National Hunt racing (i.e. Steeplechase) rules, to minimize health and safety risks, nearly all participating horses are gelded. On the other hand, in other parts of Europe, geldings are excluded from many of the most prestigious flat races including the Classics and the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe (with an exception being the French classic Prix Royal-Oak, open to geldings since 1986). In North American Thoroughbred racing, geldings, if otherwise qualified by age, winnings, or experience, are allowed in races open to intact males. The same applies in Australia.

===Concerns about gelding===
Some cultures historically did not and still seldom geld male horses, most notably the Arabs, who usually used mares for everyday work and for war. In these cultures, most stallions are still not used for breeding, only those of the best quality. When used as ordinary riding animals, they are kept only with or near other male horses in a &quot;bachelor&quot; setting, which tends to produce calmer, less stallion-like behavior. Sometimes religious reasons for these practices exist; for example, castration of both animals and humans was categorically forbidden in the Hebrew Bible and is prohibited in Jewish law.

Although castrations generally have few complications, there are risks. Castration can have complications, such as swelling, hemorrhage or post-operative bleeding, infections, and eventration. It can take up to six weeks for residual testosterone to clear from the new gelding&#x27;s system and he may continue to exhibit stallion-like behaviors in that period. For reasons not always clear, about 30% of all geldings may still display a stallion-like manner, some because of a cryptorchid testicle retained in the horse, some due to previously learned behavior, but some for no clear reason. Training to eliminate these behaviors is generally effective. If a standing castration is performed, it is possible for the horse to injure the veterinarian during the procedure. If complications arise, the horse must be immediately anesthetized. Castration does not automatically change bad habits and poor manners. This must be accomplished by proper training.

==Time of gelding==
A horse may be gelded at any age; however, if an owner intends to geld a particular foal, it is now considered best to geld the horse prior to becoming a yearling, and definitely before he reaches sexual maturity. While it was once recommended to wait until a young horse was well over a year old, even two, this was a holdover from the days when castration was performed without anesthesia and was thus far more stressful on the animal. Modern veterinary techniques can now accomplish castration with relatively little stress and minimal discomfort, so long as appropriate analgesics are employed. A few horse owners delay gelding a horse on the grounds that the testosterone gained from being allowed to reach sexual maturity will make him larger. However, recent studies have shown that this is not so: any apparent muscle mass gained solely from the presence of hormones will be lost over time after the horse is gelded, and in the meantime, the energy spent developing muscle mass may actually take away from the energy a young horse might otherwise put into skeletal growth; the net effect is that castration has no effect on rate of growth (although it may increase the amount of fat the horse carries).

Many older stallions, no longer used at stud due to age or sterility, can benefit from being gelded. Modern veterinary techniques make gelding an even somewhat elderly stallion a fairly low-risk procedure, and the horse then has the benefit of being able to be turned out safely with other horses and allowed to live a less restricted and isolated life than was allowed for a stallion.

==Specialized maintenance of geldings==

Owners of male horses, both geldings and stallions, need to occasionally check the horse&#x27;s sheath, the pocket of skin that protects the penis of the horse when it is not in use for urination (or, in the case of stallions, breeding). Geldings tend to accumulate smegma and other debris at a higher rate than stallions, probably because geldings rarely fully extrude the penis, and thus dirt and smegma build up in the folds of skin.

==Castration techniques==
There are two major techniques commonly used in castrating a horse, one requiring only local anaesthesia and the other requiring general anaesthesia. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages.

===Standing castration===
Standing castration is a technique where a horse is sedated and local anaesthesia is administered, without throwing the horse to the ground or putting him completely &quot;under&quot;. It has the benefit that general anaesthesia (GA) is not required. This method is advocated for simple procedures because the estimated mortality for GA in horses at a modern clinic is low, approximately one or two in 1000. Mortality in the field (where most horse castrations are performed) is probably higher, due to poorer facilities.

For standing castration, the colt or stallion is sedated, typically with detomidine with or without butorphanol, and often physically restrained. Local anaesthetic is injected into the parenchyma of both testes. An incision is made through the scrotum and the testes are removed, then the spermatic cord is crushed, most commonly with either ligatures or emasculators, or both. The emasculators are applied for two to three minutes, then removed, and a careful check is made for signs of haemorrhage. Assuming that bleeding is at a minimum, the other side is castrated in the same manner. Most veterinarians remove the testis held most &quot;tightly&quot; (or close to the body) by the cremaster muscle first, so as to minimize the risk of the horse withdrawing it to the point where it is inaccessible. The horse, now a gelding, is allowed to recover.

Standing castration can be performed in more complicated cases. Some authorities have described a technique for the removal of abdominally retained testes from cryptorchid animals, but most surgeons still advocate a recumbent technique, as described below. The primary drawback to standing castration is the risk that, even with sedation and restraint, the horse may object to the procedure and kick or otherwise injure the individual performing the operation.

===Recumbent castration===

Putting a horse under general anaesthesia for castration is preferred by some veterinarians because &quot;surgical exposure is improved and it carries less (overall) risk for surgeon and patient&quot;. For simple castration of normal animals, the advantages to recumbent castration are that the horse is prone, better asepsis (sterile environment) can be maintained, and better haemostasis (control of bleeding) is possible. In addition, there is significantly less risk of the surgeon or assistants being kicked. In a more complex situation such as castration of cryptorchid animals, the inguinal canal is more easily accessed. There are several different techniques (such as &quot;open&quot;, &quot;closed&quot;, and &quot;semi-closed&quot;) that may be employed, but the basic surgery is similar. However, general anaesthesia is not without risks, including post-anaesthetic myopathy (muscle damage) and neuropathy (nerve damage), respiratory dysfunction (V/Q mismatch), and cardiac depression. These complications occur with sufficient frequency that castration has a relatively high overall mortality rate. To minimize these concerns, the British Equine Veterinary Association guidelines recommend two veterinary surgeons should be present when an equine general anaesthesia is being performed.

===Aftercare===
With both castration techniques, the wound should be kept clean and allowed to drain freely to reduce the risk of hematoma formation, or development of an abscess. The use of tetanus antitoxin and analgesics (painkillers) are necessary and antibiotics are also commonly administered. The horse is commonly walked in hand for some days to reduce the development of edema.

===Possible complications===
Minor complications following castration are relatively common, while serious complications are rare. According to one in-depth study, for standing castration the complication rate is 22%, while for recumbent castration it is 6% (although with a 1% mortality).
The more common complications are:
*Post-operative swelling (edema) – minor and very common
*Scrotal/incisional infection – local seroma/abscess formation is relatively common, when the skin seals over before the deeper pocket has time to seal. This requires reopening the skin incision, to establish adequate drainage. To prevent the wounds from closing too quickly the horse needs to be exercised at least once daily after the procedure. It is common to treat the horse with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to reduce the swelling and sometimes it is necessary to give antibiotics. 
*Chronic infection leads to a schirrous cord – the formation of a granuloma at the incision site, that may not be obvious for months or even years
*Evisceration, a condition where the abdominal organs &quot;fall out&quot; of the surgical incision, is uncommon, and while the survival rate is 85–100% if treated promptly, the mortality rate is high for those not dealt with immediately.

<text>Giambologna (1529 – 13 August 1608), also known as Jean de Boulogne (French), Jehan Boulongne (Flemish) and Giovanni da Bologna (Italian), was the last significant Italian Renaissance sculptor, with a large workshop producing large and small works in bronze and marble in a late Mannerist style.

== Biography ==

Giambologna was born in Douai, Flanders (then in the Habsburg Netherlands and now in France), in 1529. After youthful studies in Antwerp with the architect-sculptor Jacques du Broeucq, he moved to Italy in 1550 and studied in Rome, making a detailed study of the sculpture of classical antiquity. He was also much influenced by Michelangelo, but developed his own Mannerist style, with perhaps less emphasis on emotion and more emphasis on refined surfaces, cool elegance, and beauty. Pope Pius IV gave Giambologna his first major commission, the colossal bronze Neptune and subsidiary figures for the Fountain of Neptune (the base designed by Tommaso Laureti, 1566) in Bologna. 

Giambologna spent his most productive years in Florence, where he had settled in 1553, initially guested at Palazzo Vecchietti. In 1563, he was named a member (&quot;Accademico&quot;) of the prestigious Accademia delle Arti del Disegno, just founded by the Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the painter-architect Giorgio Vasari, becoming also one of the Medicis&#x27; most important court sculptors. He died in Florence at the age of 79; the Medici had never allowed him to leave Florence, as they rightly feared that either the Austrian or Spanish Habsburgs would entice him into permanent employment. He was interred in a chapel he designed himself in the Santissima Annunziata.

== Work ==
Giambologna became well known for a fine sense of action and movement, and a refined, differentiated surface finish. 

Among his celebrated works are the &quot;Mercury&quot; (of which he did four versions), poised on one foot, supported by a zephyr. The god raises one arm to point heavenwards in a gesture borrowed from the repertory of classical rhetoric that is characteristic of Giambologna&#x27;s style. 

In his &quot;Abduction of a Sabine Woman&quot; (1574–82), a marble sculpture which is featured prominently in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence&#x27;s Piazza della Signoria. This sculpture, which includes three full figures, was carved from a single piece of marble. Giambologna carved it without a subject in mind, and the name &quot;Abduction of a Sabine Woman&quot; was given after it was in place in the Loggia. The sculpture was produced for Francesco I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Another of his marbles, &quot;Hercules Slaying a Centaur&quot; was also placed in the Loggia dei Lanzi in 1599. 

Giambologna&#x27;s several depictions of Venus established a canon of proportions for the female figure, and set reference models for representation of the goddess that were influential for two generations of sculptors in Italy and Northern Europe. 

He created allegories strongly promoting Medicean political propaganda, such as &quot;Florence Triumphant over Pisa&quot; and, less overtly, &quot;Samson Slaying a Philistine&quot;, for Francesco de&#x27; Medici (1562). The latter marble was made for a Medici fountain, its dramatic composition fitting its violent subject from whichever direction it is viewed. It is the only large marble work by Giambologna to have left Florence. It was given to the Duke of Lerma, then to Charles, Prince of Wales, at the time of negotiations for the Spanish Match; it was given by George III to Sir Thomas Worsley, at Hovingham Hall, Norfolk; it was purchased in 1953 for the Victoria and Albert Museum through the Art Fund.

On Michelangelo&#x27;s death in 1564, Daniele da Volterra created several busts of the sculptor from his death mask. After Volterra died in 1566, one of these busts was delivered to Giambologna, who around 1570 sculpted a clothed upper torso for the bust.

The equestrian statue of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, also in Florence, was completed by his studio assistant Pietro Tacca.

Giambologna provided as well as many sculptures for garden grottos and fountains in the Boboli Gardens of Florence and at the Villa di Pratolino, and the bronze doors of Pisa Cathedral. He created the bronze sea-horses and some other sculptures for Bartolomeo Ammannati&#x27;s Fountain of Neptune, Florence.

For the grotto of the Villa di Castello he sculpted a series of studies of individual animals, from life, which may now be viewed at the Bargello. Small bronze reductions of many of his sculptures were prized by connoisseurs at the time and ever since, for Giambologna&#x27;s reputation has never suffered eclipse.

Giambologna was an important influence on later sculptors through his pupils Adriaen de Vries and Pietro Francavilla who left his atelier for Paris in 1601, as well as Pierre Puget who spread Giambologna&#x27;s influence throughout Northern Europe, and in Italy on Pietro Tacca, who assumed Giambologna&#x27;s workshop in Florence, and in Rome on Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Alessandro Algardi.

<doc id="220980" wikidata="Q116327" url="?curid=220980" title="Akashiyaki">
<text>is a small round dumpling from the city of Akashi in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. The dumpling is made of an egg-rich batter and octopus dipped into &quot;dashi&quot; (a thin fish broth) before eating. Modern style akashiyaki was first sold in the Taishō period by a yatai owner Seitarō Mukai. 

Although &quot;takoyaki&quot;, another Japanese dumpling, is more popular in Japan, it is based on akashiyaki. Both are made with a takoyaki pan, a type of frying pan or cooktop with many hemispherical molds. Compared to takoyaki, akashiyaki has a softer, more eggy texture.

Akashiyaki is shown in the cyberpunk visual novel video game &quot;Snatcher&quot;. In the English release, however, it was changed to &quot;Neo Kobe Pizza&quot; (which substitutes soup for the &quot;dashi&quot; and a slice of pizza for the dumplings), a meal that fans of the game have gone through the effort of recreating.

== History == 
Akashiyaki used to be known as tamagoyaki (grilled egg) for a long time locally. However, around 1988, a city official renamed tamagoyaki to akashiyaki for the purpose of promoting the city of Akashi. The origin of the name comes from the decoration called &quot;akashidama&quot;. Akashidama is a kind of artificial coral made by hardening egg whites with saltpeter, and it was used as decoration in kanzashi. From the end of the Edo period to the Taisho period, the production of akashidama was a thriving local industry in Akashi. 
It is said that people started making akashiyaki because there was a large amount of leftover egg yolk and wheat flour from the production of akashidama. In addition, Akashi city had abundant catches of octopus. People started mixing those ingredients together and created akashiyaki. 

== Consumption ==
Regardless of the season, akashiyaki is eaten as lunch or a snack, both at restaurants and at home. As of 2021, there were 70 akashiyaki places in Akashi city.

<text>The  (; ) were the common people of the lower classes in late 18th-century France, a great many of whom became radical and militant partisans of the French Revolution in response to their poor quality of life under the . The word , which is opposed to &quot;aristocrat&quot;, seems to have been used for the first time on 28 February 1791 by Jean-Bernard Gauthier de Murnan in a derogatory sense, speaking about a &quot; army&quot;. The word came into vogue during the demonstration of 20 June 1792.

The name refers to their clothing, and through that to their lower-class status: were the fashionable silk knee-breeches of the 18th-century nobility and bourgeoisie, and the working class wore &quot;pantaloons&quot;, or long trousers, instead. The , most of them urban labourers, served as the driving popular force behind the revolution. They were judged by the other revolutionaries as &quot;radicals&quot; because they advocated a direct democracy, that is to say, without intermediaries such as members of parliament. Though ill-clad and ill-equipped, with little or no support from the middle and upper classes, they made up the bulk of the Revolutionary army and were responsible for many executions during the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars.

==Political ideals==
The most fundamental political ideals of the were social equality, economic equality, and popular democracy. They supported the abolition of all the authority and privileges of the monarchy, nobility, and Roman Catholic clergy, the establishment of fixed wages, the implementation of price controls to ensure affordable food and other essentials, and vigilance against counter-revolutionaries.

They expressed their demands through petitions of the sections presented to the assemblies (the Legislative, and Convention) by the delegates. The had a third way of applying pressure to achieve their demands: the police and the courts received thousands of denunciations of traitors and supposed conspirators. The height of their influence spanned roughly from the original overthrow of the monarchy in 1792 to the Thermidorian Reaction in 1794. Throughout the revolution, the provided the principal support behind the more radical and anti-bourgeoisie factions of the Paris Commune, such as the &quot;Enragés&quot; and the &quot;Hébertists&quot;, and were led by populist revolutionaries such as Jacques Roux and Jacques Hébert.

The also populated the ranks of paramilitary forces charged with physically enforcing the policies and legislation of the revolutionary government, a task that commonly included violence and the carrying out of executions against perceived enemies of the revolution.

During the peak of their influence, the were seen as the truest and most authentic sons of the French Revolution, held up as living representations of the revolutionary spirit. During the height of revolutionary fervor, such as during the Reign of Terror when it was dangerous to be associated with anything counter-revolutionary, even public functionaries and officials actually from middle or upper-class backgrounds adopted the clothing and label of the as a demonstration of solidarity with the working class and patriotism for the new French Republic.

But by early 1794, as the bourgeois and middle-class elements of the revolution began to gain more political influence, the fervent working-class radicalism of the rapidly began falling out of favour within the National Convention. It was not long before Maximilien de Robespierre and the now dominant Jacobin Club turned against the radical factions of the National Convention, including the , despite their having previously been the strongest supporters of the revolution and its government. Several important leaders of the and Hébertists were imprisoned and executed by the very revolutionary tribunals they had supported. The execution of radical leader Jacques Hébert spelled the decline of the , and with the successive rise of even more conservative governments, the Thermidorian Convention and the French Directory, they were definitively silenced as a political force. After the defeat of the 1795 popular revolt in Paris, the ceased to play any effective political role in France until the July Revolution of 1830.

==Appearance==

The distinctive costume of typical featured:
* the (long trousers) – in place of the (silk knee-breeches) worn by the upper classes
* the (short-skirted coat)
* (a type of wooden clog), and
* the red Phrygian cap, also known as a &quot;liberty cap&quot;

==Events==

On 27 April 1791, Robespierre opposed plans to reorganize the National Guard and restrict its membership to active citizens, largely property owners. He demanded the reconstitution of the army on a democratic basis to allow passive citizens. He felt that the army had to become the instrument of defence of the Revolution and no longer be a threat to it. On 28 April, despite Robespierre&#x27;s intensive campaign, the principle of an armed bourgeois militia was definitively enacted in the Assembly.

Along with other Jacobins, he urged in his magazine the creation of a revolutionary army in Paris, consisting of 20,000 men, with the goal to defend &quot;liberty&quot; (the revolution), maintain order in the sections, and educate the members in democratic principles; an idea he borrowed from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Machiavelli. According to Jean Jaures, he considered this even more important than the right to strike.

Following the king&#x27;s veto of the Assembly&#x27;s efforts to raise a militia of volunteers, the reinstatement of Brissotin ministers and suppression of non-juring priests, the monarchy faced an abortive Demonstration of 20 June 1792. Sergent-Marceau and , the administrators of police, urged the to lay down their weapons, telling them it was illegal to present a petition in arms, although their march to the Tuileries was not banned. They invited the officials to join the procession and march along with them.

Early in the morning (10 August 1792) 30,000 Fédérés, and militants from the sections led a successful assault upon the Tuileries; according to Robespierre a triumph for the &quot;passive&quot; (non-voting) citizens. , head of the in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, was appointed provisional president of the Insurrectionary Commune.

In Spring 1793, after the defection of Dumouriez, Robespierre urged the creation of a &quot; army&quot; to sweep away any conspirator.

On 1 May, the crowds threatened armed insurrection if the emergency measures demanded (price control) were not adopted. On 8 and 12 May Robespierre repeated in the Jacobin club the necessity of founding a revolutionary army consisting of , paid by a tax on the rich, to beat the aristocrats inside France and the convention. Every public square should be used to produce arms and pikes. On 18 May, Marguerite-Élie Guadet proposed to examine the &quot;exactions&quot; and to replace municipal authorities.

As rioting persisted, a commission of inquiry of twelve members, with a very strong Girondin majority, was set up to investigate the anarchy in the communes and the activities of the . On 28 May, the Paris Commune accepted the creation of a army to enforce revolutionary laws. Petitioners from the sections and the Commune appeared at the bar of the Convention at about five o&#x27;clock in the afternoon on 31 May. They demanded that a domestic revolutionary army should be raised and that the price of bread should be fixed at three a pound, that nobles holding senior rank in the army should be dismissed, that armouries should be created for arming the , the departments of State purged, suspects arrested, the right to vote provisionally reserved to only, and a fund set apart for the relatives of those defending their country and for the relief of aged and infirm. According to Hampson, the subject is quite extraordinarily complicated and obscure. The next day all Paris was in arms. 

Hanriot was ordered to march his National Guard, by this time mostly consisting of , from the town hall to the Palais National. On 2 June 1793, a large force of supposedly 80,000 and National Guards led by Hanriot, surrounded the convention with 160–172 guns.

On 4 September, the again invaded the convention. They demanded tougher measures against rising prices and the setting up of a system of terror to root out the counter-revolution. The took an especially active interest in the revolutionary army.

A &quot; army&quot; (in a sense, Robespierre&#x27;s brain-child) was formed in Paris.

Barère voiced the Committee of Public Safety&#x27;s support for the measures desired by the assembly: he presented a decree that was passed immediately, establishing a paid armed force of 6,000 men and 1,000 gunners &quot;designed to crush the counter-revolutionaries, to execute wherever the need arises the revolutionary laws and the measures of public safety that are decreed by the National Convention, and to protect provisions (A force of citizen-soldiers which could go into the countryside to supervise the requisition of grain, to prevent the manoeuvres of rich and deliver them up to the vengeance of the laws)&quot;.) For that reason, twelve travelling tribunals (with moveable guillotines) were set up.

Three months later, on 4 December, the departmental revolutionary armies (except in Paris) were banned on proposal of Tallien. The sections lost all rights to control their delegates and officials.

On 4 March 1794, there were rumours of uprising in the Cordeliers club. The Hébertists hoped that the National Convention would expel Robespierre and his Montagnard supporters. The did not respond, and Hanriot refused to cooperate. On 13 March Hébert, the voice of the , had been using the latest issue of to criticise Robespierre. On 18 March Bourdon attacked the Commune and the army. Jacques Hébert, Ronsin, Vincent, Momoro, Clootz, De Kock were arrested on charges of complicity with foreign powers (William Pitt the Younger) and guillotined on 24 March. On 27 March the infantry and cavalry of the revolutionary army, for eight months active in Paris and surroundings, were finally disbanded, except their artillery. (Hanriot was denounced by the Revolutionary Tribunal as an accomplice of Hébert, but seems to have been protected by Robespierre.)

==Montagnard influence==

The working class was especially hurt by a hail storm which damaged grain crops in 1788, which caused bread prices to skyrocket. While the peasants of rural France could sustain themselves with their farms, and the wealthy aristocracy could still afford bread, the urban workers of France, the group that comprised the &quot;&quot;, suffered. In the city, the division grew between the and these wealthy aristocrats; the former had a particular hostility &quot;towards those with large private incomes.&quot;
The faction known as the Montagnards expressed concern for the working classes of France. When the National Convention met to discuss the fate of the former king Louis XVI in 1792, the vehemently opposed a proper trial, instead opting for an immediate execution. The moderate Girondin faction voted for a trial, but the radical Montagnards sided with the &quot;&quot;, deeming that a trial was not necessary, and won with a slim majority. Louis XVI was executed on January 21, 1793.

The demands of the did not stop with the execution of the King, and the Montagnards worked hard to fulfil their mounting orders. This increased pressure from the radical masses exacerbated the ideological split between the Montagnards and the Girondins, and tensions began to grow within the convention. Eventually, by May 1793, the Montagnards worked with the National Guard—which was, at this time, mostly &#x27;—to depose many of the Girondin deputies. Jeremy Popkin writes, &quot;[the Montagnards and the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;] surrounded the Convention, and two days later the intimidated assembly suspended twenty-nine Girondin deputies. The defeated Girondin leaders fled to the provinces. The Montagnards were left in control of the Convention, which itself was clearly at the mercy of whoever could command the armed battalions.&quot; Now, whoever was in control of France&#x27;s destiny had to answer to the &#x27;, who &quot;effectively exercised legislative power&quot; in situations of unrest. Otherwise, they would risk a similar uprising and their own exile, or possibly even execution. This political shift towards radicalism would soon turn into the Reign of Terror.

==Reign of Terror==
The mass violence of the created a lasting impact during the Reign of Terror. These revolutionaries allied themselves most readily with those in power who promised radical change. The believed in a complete upheaval of the government, pushing for the execution of any that were considered corrupt by the leaders, even going as far as wanting &quot;the enemies of the republic [to] hang-main and the guillotine to stand like the first patriots, the finisher of the law.&quot; The support of the could be used as a political weapon to get rid of enemies of the Revolution. The key to Robespierre&#x27;s Terror lay in their willingness and ability to mobilize. Thus, the Committee leaders used speeches to gain their support. In a speech &quot;On the Principles of Political Morality.&quot; Robespierre proclaimed: &quot;It has been said that terror was the mainspring of despotic government. Does your government, then, resemble a despotism? Yes, as the sword which glitters in the hands of liberty&#x27;s heroes resembles the one with which tyranny&#x27;s lackeys are armed.&quot; Robespierre expressed a desire for liberty that the admired. They pushed the committee for radical changes and often found a voice with Robespierre.

==Legacy==
The popular image of the has gained currency as an enduring symbol for the passion, idealism and patriotism of the common man of the French Revolution. The term sans-culottism, in French, refers to this idealized image and the themes associated with it. Many public figures and revolutionaries who were not strictly working class styled themselves in solidarity and recognition. However, in the period immediately following the Thermidorian Reaction, the and other far-left political factions were heavily persecuted and repressed by the likes of the Muscadins.

The French Republican Calendar at first termed the complementary days at the end of the year &quot;Sansculottides&quot;; however, the National Convention suppressed the name when adopting the Constitution of the Year III (1795) and substituted the name (&quot;additional days&quot;).

==Analysis==
According to Sally Waller, part of the mantra was &quot;permanent anticipation of betrayal and treachery&quot;. The members of the were constantly on edge and fearing betrayal, which can be attributed to their violent and radical rebellion tactics.
Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm observes that the were a &quot;shapeless, mostly urban movement of the labouring poor, small craftsmen, shopkeepers, artisans, tiny entrepreneurs and the like&quot;. He further notes they were organised notably in the local political clubs of Paris and &quot;provided the main striking-force of the revolution&quot;. Hobsbawm writes that these were the actual demonstrators, rioters and constructors of the street barricades. However, Hobsbawm maintains, &quot;sans-culottism&quot; provided no real alternative to the bourgeois radicalism of the Jacobins; from Hobsbawm&#x27;s Marxist perspective, the ideal of the &quot;&quot;, which sought to express the interests of the &quot;little men&quot; who existed between the poles of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, was contradictory and ultimately unrealizable.

The Marxist historian Albert Soboul emphasized the importance of the as a social class, a sort of proto-proletariat that played a central role in the French Revolution. That view has been sharply attacked by scholars who say the were not a class at all. As one historian observes, Soboul&#x27;s concept has not been used by scholars in any other period of French history.

==Modern colloquial usage==
The term &quot;culottes&quot; in more recent French describes women&#x27;s underpants, an article of clothing that has little or no relation to the historical culottes, but now also refers to apparent skirts that are actually split with two legs. The term has been used colloquially to mean not wearing underpants.

<doc id="220990" wikidata="Q1537250" url="?curid=220990" title="List of delegates to the Continental Congress">
<text>The Continental Congress was initially a convention of delegates from several British American colonies at the height of the American Revolution era, who spoke and acted collectively for the people of the Thirteen Colonies that ultimately became the United States. The term mostly refers to the First Continental Congress of 1774 and the Second Continental Congress of 1775–1781. It also refers to the Congress of the Confederation of 1781–1789, which covers the period following the establishment of American independence with the end of the Revolutionary War. During this period, the Continental Congress served as the chief legislative and executive body of the U.S. government.

The unicameral Congress of the Confederation, officially styled &quot;The United States in Congress Assembled,&quot; delegates elected by the legislature of the various states. The Confederation Congress was the immediate successor to the Second Continental Congress; and delegates to it were similarly chosen. Many of the delegates to the initial 1775 session of the Second Continental Congress had also attended the previous First Continental Congress. Altogether, The &quot;Biographical Directory of the United States Congress&quot; lists 343 men who served as delegates to the Continental Congress in three incarnations from 1774 to 1789; also listed are another 90 persons who were elected as delegates but never served.

== Background ==
Convened in response to the Intolerable Acts passed by the British Parliament earlier that year, the 56 delegates to the First Continental Congress sought to help repair the frayed relationship between the British government and its American colonies. They passed the Continental Association, an economic boycott of Great Britain, and petitioned the king for a redress of grievances. They also resolved to reconvene in May 1775 if necessary.

Delegates from the various colonies did indeed reconvene for a Second Continental Congress as scheduled, but by the time they gathered, the Revolutionary War had begun. Moderates in the Congress still hoped that the colonies could be reconciled with Great Britain, but a movement towards independence steadily gained ground. At this juncture Congress simultaneously sent an Olive Branch Petition to King George III, hoping for a rapprochement, and issued a Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, which contained the words &quot;Our cause is just. Our union is perfect... being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves...&quot;.
Congress functioned as a &quot;de facto&quot; national government from the outset by establishing the Continental Army, directing strategy, and appointing diplomats. It eventually adopted the Lee Resolution which established the new country on July 2, 1776, and it agreed to the Declaration of Independence two days later.

Afterward, the Congress functioned as the provisional government of the United States through March 1, 1781. During this period, in addition to successfully managing the war effort, its primary achievements included: drafting the Articles of Confederation, the first U.S. Constitution; securing diplomatic recognition and support from foreign nations; and resolving state land claims west of the Appalachian Mountains. When the Articles of Confederation came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states, the Continental Congress became the Congress of the Confederation, which helped guide the new nation through the final stages of the Revolutionary War. Under the Articles, the Confederation Congress had limited power. It could declare war, sign treaties, and settle disputes between the states. It could also borrow or print money, but did not have the power to tax; nor could it compel the individual states to comply with its decisions. It convened in eight sessions (a ninth failed to achieve a quorum) prior to being supplanted in 1789, when the United States Congress became the nation&#x27;s legislative branch of government under a new Constitution.

== Article V of the Articles of Confederation ==
Article V of the Articles of Confederation for the annual election of delegates to Congress by legislatures of the various states to terms that commenced on the first Monday in November, in every year. Each state could send 2–7 delegates, and no person was permitted to serve as a delegate for more than three years within a span of six years. State legislatures also had the authority to recall or to replace its delegates at any time. Prior to 1781, delegates to the Continental Congress served at the pleasure of the state legislature that commissioned them; neither term limits nor specific start–end–date of service existed.

<text>The Serviço Nacional de Informações () or SNI was the intelligence agency of Brazil during its military dictatorship. It was created by President Castelo Branco via Law 4371/64 and remained active until dissolved by Fernando Collor in 1990. Intelligence activities in Brazil were then subordinate to the Brazilian Federal Police until Fernando Henrique Cardoso sanctioned Law 9883/97, which created the Brazilian Intelligence Agency.

==History==

Originally, the SNI was a civilian agency under the retired General Golbery do Couto e Silva in 1964. It provided Castelo Branco with an alternative intelligence source and was initially trained by the PIDE of the Salazar regime.
After the political dominance of Brazilian hard-liners in 1967, the SNI came under military control and began to be trained by the CIA. The agency was the backbone of the regime&#x27;s anti-communist actions. Although there have been secret police in Brazil since at least the Vargas era, military involvement reached new heights with the creation of the SNI. It grew out of the Institute for Research and Social Studies (Instituto de Pesquisas e Estudos Sociais or IPES), which Couto e Silva had established to undermine the former Goulart government (1961–64).

In 1973, control over the domestic intelligence community with the opening of the Escola Nacional de Informações (EsNI or National Intelligence School) was established. The following year, the EsNI absorbed the Escola Superior de Guerra postgraduate intelligence course.

Supposedly, the EsNI did not train police agents and selected its own students. By 1980 some officers were saying that the EsNI would be as useful as the ESG to their careers.

==Structure==
In theory, the SNI supervised and coordinated the intelligence agencies of the three services, but in practice the service agencies maintained their .

The three service agencies were:
*The Army Information Center (Centro de Informações do Exército, or CIE)
*The Air force Information Center (Centro de Informações da Aeronáutica, or CISA)
*The Naval Information Center (Centro de Informações de Marinha, or Cenimar).

The branch chiefs of staff were technically responsible for the intelligence work in their designated service. But in fact, CIE activities followed a parallel chain of command, and so the officers were often left uninformed.

Each command also had an Internal Operations Department-Internal Defense Operations Center (Departamento de Operações Internas-Centro de Operações de Defesa Interna—known as DOI-CODI).
==CIE==

From the outset, there was resistance to the idea of the CIE. In 1966 President Castelo Branco rejected the idea of creating an army intelligence service, because it would weaken the General Staff. The next year, 1967, the new minister of the army, General Aurélio de Lira Tavares, established the CIE over the objections of the chief of staff, General Orlando Geisel.

As early as 1968, the CIE began bombing theaters, destroying bookstores, and kidnapping people. When insurgents began terrorist violence in late 1968, the CIE expanded to about 200 officers and began a counter-offensive, eliminating all signs of violence in three years.

President Geisel, a retired general, struggled to have his orders fulfilled by the CIE system. Consequently, the CIE sought to undermine his government and to make Army Minister Sylvio Couto Coelho da Frota the next president. The CIE also waged a pamphlet war against the previously mentioned Couto e Silva, chief of Geisel&#x27;s Civilian Household, who wanted to shut down the CIE.

==Methods of surveillance==

The SNI provided clearance for anyone seeking a government job or requesting to conduct research in the army archives. Using an elaborate system of informants and telephone taps, the SNI accumulated and analyzed reports on many sources.
One study by political scientist David V. Fleischer and Robert Wesson suggests that there were as many as 50,000 persons employed in the SNI during the 1964-85 regime. Furthermore, both Presidents Médici and Figueiredo had been SNI chiefs.

==Notable differences==

Alfred Stepan, a professor of political science at Columbia University, observed that the SNI differed from similar agencies in other countries. In retrospect, he noted that it had quite a monopoly in operations and training, with a voice as a ministry in the presidential cabinet and representation in almost every facet of public life. High-ranking officials helped achieve SNI security goals through their government positions. Moreover, the SNI was completely autonomous, giving it an unprecedented power.

<doc id="221004" wikidata="Q3630992" url="?curid=221004" title="Wholesale price index">
<text>The wholesale price index (WPI) is the price of a representative basket of wholesale goods. 

The WPI is published by the Economic Adviser in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Wholesale Price Index focuses on the price of goods traded between corporations, rather than the goods bought by consumers, which is measured by the Consumer Price Index. The purpose of the WPI is to monitor price movements that reflect supply and demand in industry, manufacturing and construction. This helps in analyzing both macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions.

Some countries (like the Philippines) use WPI changes as a central measure of inflation. But now India has adopted new CPI to measure inflation. However, United States now report a [[producer price index]] (PPI) instead. It also influences stock and fixed price markets. 

== Calculation ==
The wholesale price index (WPI) is based on the wholesale price of a few relevant commodities of over 240 commodities available. The commodities chosen for the calculation are based on their importance in the region and the point of time the WPI is employed. For example, in India about 435 items were used for calculating the WPI in base year 1993-94 while the advanced base year 2011-12 uses 697 items. Currently the base year has been revised from 2004-05 to 2011-12 by the Office of Economic Advisor(OEA), Department for promotion of industry and internal trade Ministry of Commerce and Industry to align it with the base year of other macro economic indicators 
like the gross domestic product (GDP)and Index of Industrial Production (IIP).

Under primary article group of the new WPI there are 117 items against earlier 98, while fuel and power category remains static at 16. In the new series, there are 564 items of manufactured products compared to 318 items earlier.

The indicator tracks the price movement of each commodity individually. Based on this individual movement, the WPI is determined through the averaging principle. The following methods are used to compute the WPI:

The Laspeyres Formula is the weighted arithmetic mean based on the fixed value-based weights for the base period.

The Ten-Day Price Index is a procedure under which, “sample prices” with high intra-month fluctuations are selected and surveyed every ten days by phone. Utilizing the data retrieved by this procedure, and with the assumption that other non-surveyed “sample prices” remain unchanged, a “ten-day price index” is compiled and released.

Monthly price indexes are compiled by calculating the simple arithmetic mean of three ten-day “sample prices” in the month.

<doc id="221005" wikidata="Q56166" url="?curid=221005" title="Chevrolet Corvette">
<text>The Chevrolet Corvette is a line of American two-door, two-seater sports cars manufactured and marketed by General Motors under the Chevrolet marque since 1953.

Throughout eight generations, indicated sequentially as C1 to C8, the Corvette is noted for its performance, distinctive styling, lightweight fiberglass or composite bodywork, and competitive pricing. The Corvette has had domestic mass-produced two-seater competitors fielded by American Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; it is the only one continuously produced by a United States auto manufacturer. It serves as Chevrolet&#x27;s halo car.

Since its introduction in 1953, the two-seater has steadily moved upmarket. Initially, a relatively modest, lightweight 6cylinder convertible, subsequent introductions of V8 engines, competitive chassis innovations, and rear mid-engined layout have positioned the Corvette in the supercar class. The first three Corvette generations (1953–1983) employed body-on-frame construction, and since the C4 generation, introduced in 1983 as an early 1984 model, Corvettes have used GM&#x27;s unibody Ybody platform. All Corvettes used front mid-engine configuration for seven generations, through 2019, and transitioned to a rear mid-engined layout with the C8 generation.

In 1953, GM executives accepted a suggestion by Myron Scott, then the assistant director of the Public Relations department, to name the company&#x27;s new sports car after the corvette, a small, maneuverable warship. The first model, a convertible, was introduced at the 1953 GM Motorama as a concept car; production models went on sale later that year. In 1963, the second generation was introduced in coupe and convertible styles. Initially manufactured in Flint, Michigan, and St. Louis, Missouri, the Corvette has been produced in Bowling Green, Kentucky, since 1981, which is also the location of the National Corvette Museum.

The Corvette has become widely known as &quot;America&#x27;s Sports Car.&quot; &quot;Automotive News&quot; wrote that after being featured in the early 1960s television show &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;the Corvette became synonymous with freedom and adventure,&quot; ultimately becoming both &quot;the most successful concept car in history and the most popular sports car in history.&quot;

== History ==

=== First generation (C1; 1953–1962) ===


The first generation of Corvette was introduced late in the 1953 model year, appearing as a show car for the 1953 General Motors Motorama, January 17–23 at New York&#x27;s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. At the time, Chevrolet general manager Thomas H. Keating said it was six months to a year away from production readiness. The car generated sufficient interest for mass production to begin on June 30, 1953.

Uniquely, the original Corvette used fiberglass bodywork, its reinforcement placed by hand. This generation was often referred to as the &quot;solid-axle&quot; models, with independent rear suspension appearing in the next. Three hundred hand-built Corvette convertibles were produced, all Polo White, for the 1953 model year.

The 1954 model year vehicles could be ordered in Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, Black, or Polo White; 3,640 were manufactured.

The 1953, 1954, and 1955 model years were the only Corvettes equipped with a version of the second-generation Blue Flame inline-six rated at .

The 1955 model offered a V8 engine as an option. The new V8 improved acceleration by 3 seconds. With a large inventory of unsold 1954 models, GM limited production to 700 units for 1955. Despite the poor sales of the Corvette at the time, the V8 was a popular option, with an estimated six cars produced with the inline-six.

Three new competitors, the Ford Thunderbird, the Studebaker Speedster, and the larger Chrysler C-300 were introduced that same year.

A new body was introduced for the 1956 model featuring a revised front end and side coves; the taillamp fins were deleted. An optional &quot;Ramjet&quot; fuel injection system was made available midway through the 1957 model year. It was one of the first American mass-produced engines in history to reach and Chevrolet&#x27;s advertising agency used a &quot;one hp per cubic inch&quot; slogan for advertising the Small-Block engine. Other options included power windows (1956), hydraulically assisted convertible top (1956), heavy-duty brakes and suspension (1957), and four-speed manual transmission (late 1957). Delco Radio transistorized signal-seeking &quot;hybrid&quot; car radio, which used both vacuum tubes and transistors in its radio&#x27;s circuitry (1956 option).

The 1958 Corvette received a body and interior revisions including a longer front end with quad headlamps, bumper exiting exhaust tips, revised steering wheel, and a dashboard with all gauges mounted directly in front of the driver. For 1958 only were 1958 hood louvers and twin trunk spears. The 1959–60 model years had few changes except a decreased amount of body chrome and more powerful engine offerings.

In 1961, the rear of the car was completely redesigned with the addition of a tapered tail with four round lights. The light treatment would continue for all following model year Corvettes until 2014. In 1962, the Chevrolet Small-Block was enlarged to . In standard form it was rated at . For an additional 12% over list price, the fuel-injected version produced , making it the fastest of the C1 generation. 1962 was also the last year for the wraparound windshield, solid rear axle, and convertible-only body style. The trunk lid and exposed headlamps did not reappear for many decades.

=== Second generation (C2; 1963–1967) ===

The second generation (C2) Corvette, which introduced Sting Ray to the model, continued with fiberglass body panels, and overall, was smaller than the first generation. The car was designed by Larry Shinoda with major inspiration from a previous concept design called the &quot;Q Corvette,&quot; which was created by Peter Brock and Chuck Pohlmann under the styling direction of Bill Mitchell. Earlier, Mitchell had sponsored a car known as the &quot;Mitchell Sting Ray&quot; in 1959 because Chevrolet no longer participated in factory racing. This vehicle had the largest effect on the styling of this generation, although it had no top and did not give away what the final version of the C2 would look like. The third inspiration was a mako shark Mitchell had caught while deep-sea fishing.
Production started for the 1963 model year and ended in 1967. Introducing a new name, &quot;Sting Ray&quot;, the 1963 model was the first year for a Corvette coupé and it featured a distinctive tapering rear deck (a feature that later reappeared on the 1971 &quot;Boattail&quot; Buick Riviera) with, for 1963 only, a split rear window. The Sting Ray featured hidden headlamps, non-functional hood vents, and an independent rear suspension. Corvette chief engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov never liked the split rear window because it blocked rear vision, but Mitchell thought it to be a key part of the entire design. Maximum power for 1963 was and was raised to in 1964. Options included electronic ignition, the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic first offered on some 1963 Pontiac models. On 1964 models the decorative hood vents were eliminated and Duntov, the Corvette&#x27;s chief engineer, got his way with the split rear window changed to a full-width window.

Four-wheel disc brakes were introduced in 1965, as was a &quot;big block&quot; engine option: the  V8. Side exhaust pipes were also optionally available in 1965, and continued to be offered through 1967. The introduction of the big block in 1965 spelled the beginning of the end for the Rochester fuel injection system. The option cost while the fuel injected engine cost . Few could justify spending more for less, even though FI could deliver over 20 mpg on the highway and would keep delivering fuel despite high G-loading in corners taken at racing speeds. Another 1963 and 1964 option was the Z06 competition package, which offered stiffer suspension, bigger, multi-segment lined brakes with finned drums, and more. Only a couple hundred coupes and a single convertible were factory-equipped this way in 1963. With only 771 fuel-injected cars built in 1965, Chevrolet discontinued the option at the end of the 1965 production, having introduced a less-expensive big block 396 engine rated at 425 hp in the middle of the production year and selling over 2,000 in just a few months. For 1966, Chevrolet introduced an even larger Big Block version. Other options available on the C2 included the Wonderbar auto-tuning AM radio, AM-FM radio (mid-1963), air conditioning (late-1963), a telescopic steering wheel (1965), and headrests (1966). The Sting Ray&#x27;s independent rear suspension was successfully adapted for the new-for-1965 Chevrolet Corvair, which solved the quirky handling problems of that unique rear-engine compact.

1967 was the final model year for the second generation. The 1967 model featured restyled fender vents, less ornamentation, and backup lamps - which were inboard in 1966 - became rectangular and centrally located. The first use of all four taillights in red started in 1961 and was continued thru the C2 line-up except for 1966. This feature returned for the 1967 model year and then continued until 1968, the first C3 model year. The 1967 model year had the first L88 engine option that was rated at , but unofficial estimates place the output at or more. Only twenty such engines were installed at the factory. From 1967 through 1969, the Holley triple two-barrel carburetor, or Tri-Power, was available on the 427 L89 (a $368 option, on top of the cost for the high-performance 427). Despite these changes, sales slipped more than 15%, to 22,940 (8,504 coupes, off close to 15%, and 14,436 convertibles, down nearly 19%).

Duntov came up with a lightweight version of the C2 in 1962. Concerned about Ford and what they were doing with the Shelby Cobra, GM planned to manufacture 100 to 125 Grand Sport Corvettes, but only five were actually built. They were driven by historic drivers such as Roger Penske, A. J. Foyt, Jim Hall, and Dick Guldstrand among others. Those five cars (001–005) are all held by private owners, and are among the most coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built. 002 is exhibited in the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum and is in running condition.

=== Third generation (C3; 1968–1982) ===

The third-generation Corvette, patterned after the Mako Shark II concept car, was introduced for the 1968 model year and was in production until 1982. C3 coupes featured the first use of T-top removable roof panels. It introduced monikers that were later revived, such as LT-1, ZR-1, Z07, and Collector Edition. In 1978, Corvette&#x27;s 25th anniversary was celebrated with a two-tone Silver Anniversary Edition and an Indy Pace Car replica edition of the C3. This was also the first time that a Corvette was used as a Pace Car for the Indianapolis 500.

Engines and chassis components were mostly carried over from the C2, but the body and interior were new. The engine replaced the old as the base engine in 1969, but power remained at . 1969 was the only year for a C3 to optionally offer either a factory-installed side exhaust or a normal rear exit with chrome tips. The all-aluminum big-block ZL-1 engine was also new for 1969; the special racing engine was listed at , but was reported to produce and accelerated a ZL-1 through the in 10.89 seconds.

There was an extended production run for the 1969 model year due to a lengthy labor strike, which meant sales were down on the 1970 models, to 17,316. 1970 small-block power peaked with the optional high compression, high-revving small-block LT-1 that produced . The 427 big-block was enlarged to with a rating. The ZR-1 special package was an option available on the 1970 through 1972 model years, and included the LT-1 engine combined with special racing equipment. Only 53 ZR-1&#x27;s were built.

In 1971, to accommodate regular low-lead fuel with lower anti-knock properties, the engine compression ratios were lowered which resulted in reduced power ratings. The power rating for the L48 base engine decreased from 300 to 270 horsepower and the optional special high-performance LT1 engine decreased from 370 to 330 horsepower. The LS5 motor was carried over and produced . Offered in ‘71 only was the LS6 big-block featuring aluminum heads and delivering , the highest of the 1970-1972 series, and could be ordered with an automatic transmission. For the 1972 model year, GM moved to the SAE Net measurement which resulted in further reduced, but more realistic, power ratings than the previous SAE Gross standard. Although the 1972 model&#x27;s horsepower was actually the same as that for the 1971 model year, the lower net horsepower numbers were used instead of gross horsepower. The L48 base engine rating fell to SAE and the optional LT1 dropped to SAE. 1974 models had the last true dual exhaust system that was dropped on the 1975 models with the introduction of catalytic converters requiring the use of no-lead fuel. Engine power decreased with the base ZQ3 engine producing , the optional L82&#x27;s output , while the 454 big-block engine was discontinued. Gradual power increases after 1975 peaked in 1980 with the model&#x27;s optional L82 producing in its final year. 1981 saw a single engine, the L81, which had while the fuel-injected 1982 L83 had .

Styling changed subtly throughout the generation until 1978 for the car&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The Sting Ray nameplate was not used on the 1968 model, but Chevrolet still referred to the Corvette as a Sting Ray; however, 1969 (through 1976) models used the &quot;Stingray&quot; name as one word, without the space. In 1970, the body design was updated including fender flares, and interiors were refined, including redesigned seats and indication lights near the gear shift that were an early use of fiber optics. To comply with government safety regulations the 1973 Corvette&#x27;s chrome front bumper was changed to a system with a urethane bumper cover, while the rear retained the two-piece chrome bumper set, its last year. The optional wire-spoked wheel covers (left) were offered for the last time in 1973. Only 45 Z07 were built in 1973. From 1974 onwards both the front and rear bumpers were polyurethane.

In 1974, a rear bumper system with a two-piece, tapering urethane bumper cover replaced the Kamm-tail and chrome bumper blades, and matched the new front design from the previous year. The 1975 model year ended the convertible body style until it returned 11 years later, and Dave McLellan succeeded Zora Arkus-Duntov as the Corvette&#x27;s Chief Engineer. For the 1976 models the fiberglass floor was replaced with steel panels to provide protection from the catalytic converter&#x27;s high operating temperature. For 15 model years the names Corvette, Sting Ray, and Stingray were synonymous. 1977 was the last year the tunneled roof treatment with a vertical back window was used, in addition, leather seats were available at no additional cost for the first time. The black exterior color returned after a six-year absence.

The 1978 25th Anniversary model introduced the fastback glass rear window and featured a new interior and dashboard. Corvette&#x27;s 25th anniversary was celebrated with the Indy 500 Pace Car limited edition and a Silver Anniversary model featuring silver over gray lower body paint. All 1979 models featured the previous year&#x27;s pace car seats and offered the front and rear spoilers as optional equipment. 53,807 were produced for the model year, making 1979 the peak production year for all versions of the Corvette. Sales have trended downward since then. In 1980, the Corvette received an integrated aerodynamic redesign that resulted in a significant reduction in drag. After several years of weight increases, 1980 Corvettes were lighter as engineers trimmed both body and chassis weight. In mid-1981, production relocated from St. Louis, to Bowling Green, Kentucky (where all subsequent Corvette generations have since been manufactured), and several two-tone paint options were offered. The 1981 models were the last available with a manual transmission until well into the 1984 production run. In 1982, a fuel-injected engine returned, and a final C3 tribute Collectors Edition featured an exclusive, opening rear window hatch.

=== Fourth generation (C4; 1984–1996) ===
The fourth-generation Corvette was the first complete redesign of the Corvette since 1963. Production was to begin for the 1983 model year, but quality issues and part delays resulted in only 43 prototypes for the 1983 model year produced that were never sold. All of the 1983 prototypes were destroyed or serialized as 1984 model year except one white example with a medium blue interior. After extensive testing and modifications were completed, it was initially retired as a display sitting in an external wall over the Bowling Green Assembly Plant&#x27;s employee entrance. Later this only surviving 1983 prototype was removed, restored, and put on display at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It is still owned by GM. On February 12, 2014, it was nearly lost to a sinkhole which opened up under the museum. Eight other Corvettes were severely damaged.

Regular fourth generation production began on January 3, 1983; the 1984 model year and delivery to customers began in March 1983. The 1984 model carried over the L83 &quot;Crossfire&quot; V8 engine from the final 1982 third-generation model. New chassis features were aluminum brake calipers and an all-aluminum suspension for weight savings and rigidity. The new one-piece Targa top had no center reinforcement. Retractable headlights continued to be used, but became single units, which had been last used in 1957. A new electronic dashboard with digital liquid crystal displays for the speedometer and tachometer was standard. Beginning in 1985, the L98 engine with tuned port fuel injection became the standard engine.

September 1984 through 1988 Corvettes were available with a &quot;4+3&quot; transmission designed by Doug Nash - a four-speed manual coupled to an automatic overdrive on the top three gears. It was devised to help the Corvette meet U.S. fuel economy standards. Since 1981 (when it was last offered), a manual transmission returned to the Corvette starting with production in late 1984. The transmission proved to be problematic and was replaced by a modern ZF six-speed manual transmission in 1989.

In 1986, the second Corvette Indy Pace Car was released. It was the first convertible Corvette since 1975. A Center High Mounted Signal Light (CHMSL) – a third center brake light – was added in 1986 to comply with safety regulations. While the color of the pace car used in the race was yellow, all 1986 convertibles also had an Indy 500 emblem mounted on the console, making any color a &quot;pace car edition&quot;. In 1987, the B2K twin-turbo option became available from the factory. The Callaway Corvette was a Regular Production Option (RPO B2K). The B2K option coexisted in 1990 and 1991 with the ZR-1 option, which then replaced it. Early B2Ks produced and ; later versions boasted and .

1988 saw the 35th Anniversary Edition of the Corvette. In 1990, the ZR1 option Corvette was introduced with the LT5 engine designed by Lotus and built in the Mercury Marine plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The LT5 engine was a four-cam (DOHC) design producing . The C4 ZR1 ran from 1990 thru 1995 model years. In 1991, all Corvettes received updates to the body, interior, and wheels. The convex rear fascia that set the 1990 ZR-1 apart from the base model was included on L98 Corvettes, making the styling of the expensive ZR-1 nearly identical to that of the base cars. The most obvious difference remaining between the base and ZR-1 models besides the wider rear wheels was the location of the CHMSL, which was integrated into the new rear fascia used on the base model, but remained at the top of the rear hatch on the ZR-1&#x27;s.

For the 1992 model year, the LT1 engine was introduced, an increase of over 1991&#x27;s L98 engine. This engine featured reverse-flow cooling (the heads were cooled before the block), which allowed for a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1. Also new for 1992 was Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR), a form of traction control that utilized the Corvette&#x27;s brakes, spark retard, and throttle close-down to prevent excessive rear wheel spin and possible loss of control.

Production of the ZR-1 ended in 1995 after 6,939 cars had been built. 1996 was the final year of C4 production, and featured special models and options, including the Grand Sport and Collector Edition, OBD II (On-Board Diagnostics), run-flat tires, and the LT4 engine. The LT4 V8 was available only with a manual transmission, while all LT1 Corvettes used automatic transmissions. Chevrolet released the Grand Sport (GS) version in 1996 to mark the end of production of the C4 Corvette. The Grand Sport moniker was a nod to the original Grand Sport model produced in 1963. The Grand Sport came only in Admiral Blue with a white stripe down the middle, black wheels, and two red stripes on the front left wheel arch.

=== Fifth generation (C5; 1997–2004) ===

The C5 Corvette was redesigned from the ground up after sales from the previous generation began to decline. Production of the C5 Corvette began in 1996 but quality/manufacturing issues saw its public release delayed until 1997. C5 production continued through the 2004 model year. The C5 was a completely new design featuring new concepts and manufacturing innovations, subsequently carried forward to the C6 &amp; C7. With a top speed of , the C5 was noted by the automotive press as an advance, with improved dynamics in nearly every area over the C4. Innovations included a 0.29 drag coefficient, a notably lower weight with near 50/50 weight distribution, and active handling (the first stability control for a Corvette).
An all-new LS1 aluminum engine (Gen III small block) featured individual ignition coils for each cylinder, and aluminum block and pistons. It was initially rated at and , but was increased to in the 2001 edition. The new engine, combined with the new body, was able to achieve up to 28 mpg on the highway.
For its first year, the C5 was available only as a coupe, though the new platform was designed from the ground up to be a convertible, introduced for model year 1998. A fixed-roof coupe (FRC) followed in 1999. One concept for the FRC was for it to be a stripped-down model with a possible V6 engine (nicknamed in-house as the &quot;Billy Bob&quot;). By 2000, FRC plans laid the groundwork for the return in 2001 of the Z06, an RPO option not seen since Zora&#x27;s 1963 race-ready Corvette.

The Z06 model replaced the FRC model as the highest-performance C5 Corvette. Instead of a heavier double-overhead cam engine like the ZR-1 of the C4 generation, the Z06 used an LS6, a derivative of the standard LS1 engine. Using the much more rigid fixed roof design allowed the Z06 unprecedented handling thanks to upgraded brakes and less body flex. Those characteristics, along with the use of materials such as a titanium exhaust system and a carbon fiber hood in the 2004 model year, led to further weight savings and performance gains for the C5 Z06. The LS6 was later upgraded to for 2002–2004. Although the Z06&#x27;s rated power output is equal to that of the C4 ZR-1, the improved rigidity, suspension, brakes, and reduced weight of the C5 produced a car quicker than C4 ZR-1.

=== Sixth generation (C6; 2005–2013) ===


For the C6 Corvette GM wanted to focus more on refining the C5 than trying to redesign it. Car &amp; Driver, and Motor Trend, described the C6 as an &quot;evolution of the C5, instead of a complete redo&quot;. The C6 wheelbase was increased while body overhangs were decreased when compared to the C5. Retractable headlights were replaced with fixed units, for the first time since 1962. The C6 brought a new and improved interior compared to the C5. As a result of the upgraded interior, the C6 had a slight increase in passenger hip room. It also sported an updated engine called the LS2, which bumped the LS1/LS6 to and gained 50 HP, delivering at 6000 rpm and at 4400 rpm, and giving the vehicle a time of under 4.2 seconds. Its top speed was . The C6 shared some components with the Cadillac XLR hard-top convertible introduced two years earlier in 2003.

The C6 generation did not match the previous generation&#x27;s relatively good fuel economy, despite its relatively low 0.28 drag coefficient and low curb weight, achieving 16/26 mpg (city/highway) equipped with automatic or manual transmissions; like all manual transmission Corvettes since 1989, it is fitted with Computer Aided Gear Selection (CAGS) to improve fuel economy by requiring drivers to shift from 1st gear directly to 4th in low-speed/low-throttle conditions. This feature helps the C6 avoid the Gas Guzzler Tax by achieving better fuel economy.

The new Z06 arrived as a 2006 model in the third quarter of 2005. It has a 7.0 L version of the small block engine codenamed &quot;LS7&quot;. At 427.6 cubic inches, the Z06 was the largest small block ever offered by General Motors. Because of the Corvette&#x27;s former use of 427 cubic-inch big blocks in the late-1960s and early 1970s, the LS7&#x27;s size was rounded down to 427 cubic inches. Official output was and has a time of 3.7 seconds. Top speed is . Another first for a Corvette, the Z06 featured a full aluminum chassis. The frame mirrored the C5/6 architecture, but substituted aluminum hydroformed rails and aluminum extrusions and castings fore and aft. This dropped weight from 419 to 287 pounds while improving chassis stiffness.

For 2008, the Corvette received a mild freshening: a new LS3 engine with displacement increased to , resulting in and ( and if ordered with the optional performance exhaust). The six-speed manual transmission also has improved shift linkage and a time of 4.0 seconds, while the automatic is set up for quicker shifts giving the C6 automatic a time of 4.0 seconds, quicker than any other production automatic Corvette. The interior was slightly updated and a new 4LT leather-wrap interior package was added. The wheels were also updated to a new five-spoke design.

The ZR1 was formally announced in a December 2007 press statement by General Motors, where it was revealed that their target of per had been reached by a new &quot;LS9&quot; engine with an Eaton-supercharged 6.2-liter engine producing and of torque. The LS9 engine was the most powerful to be put into a GM production sports car. Its top speed was .

The historical name &quot;Grand Sport&quot; returned to the Corvette lineup in 2010 as an entirely new model series that replaced the Z51 option. The new model was an LS3 equipped Z06 with a steel frame instead of aluminum. It retained many of the features of the Z06 including a wide body with 18x9.5 and 19x12 inch wheels, dry-sump oiling (manual transmission coupes only), 6-piston 14-inch front brakes and 4-piston rear, and improved suspension. Manual transmission-equipped G/S coupe models received a tweaked LS3 with a forged crank, are built in Z06 fashion by hand, and utilize a dry-sump oil system. The first three gears were also made shorter for better throttle response and faster acceleration. A new launch control system was introduced for all models that allow for sub-4-second 0–60. EPA is estimated at 26 MPG highway, 1.0 G on skid pad.

Beginning with the 2011 model year, buyers of the Corvette Z06 and ZR1 were offered the opportunity to assist in the build of their engines. Titled the &quot;Corvette Engine Build Experience,&quot; buyers paid extra to be flown to the Wixom, Michigan Performance Build Center. Participants helped the assembly line workers build the V8 engine, then took delivery of the car at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, KY, near the Corvette final assembly point.

The last C6 Corvette was manufactured in February 2013. In May 2013, a federal investigation of problems with more than 100,000 C6 lighting systems was announced.

=== Seventh generation (C7; 2014–2019) ===

Development for the seventh generation Corvette started in 2007. A prime consideration was countering not just the perception but the fact that the Corvette had become an &quot;old man&#x27;s toy&quot; - confirmed by an October 2012 GM study which showed that about 46 percent of Corvette buyers were 55 or older, compared with 22 percent of Audi R8 and 30 percent of Porsche 911 customers. The head of Chevy marketing, Chris Perry, acknowledged that too many people saw it as the car of &quot;the successful plumber.&quot; John Fitzpatrick, Corvette&#x27;s marketing manager said &quot;It&#x27;s the old saying, &#x27;Nobody wants to be seen driving an old man&#x27;s car, but everybody wants to be seen driving a young man&#x27;s car.&#x27; &quot;

Originally set to be introduced for the 2011 model year, the C7&#x27;s debut was delayed until the 2014 model year to make changes to make the car more appealing to younger buyers. Mid-engine and rear-engine layouts had been considered, but the front-engine, rear-wheel drive (RWD) platform was retained to keep production costs lower.
Promotional efforts towards a new generation of buyers included a camouflaged version of the car was made available in the popular video game &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; in November 2012, and the C7 being featured as the 2013 Indianapolis 500 pace car, the Corvette&#x27;s 12th time in that spotlight.

The 2014 Chevrolet Corvette included an LT1 6.2 L V8 (376 cu in) making or with the optional performance exhaust. The LT1 engine (the &quot;LT1&quot; designation was first used by GM in 1970 and then later in 1992.) is in the Gen V family of small block engines, which was used in GM vehicles as the new small V8 option. It featured three new advanced technologies: direct injection, variable valve timing, and an active fuel management system. Fuel injectors are located under the intake manifold. The Corvette remained rear-wheel drive with the transaxle located in the rear. Transmission choices included a 7-speed manual or a 6-speed (2014) / 8-speed (2015-) automatic with paddle shifters. The new interior included wide-bottom seats as standard, with sportier versions with high side bolsters optional. The Corvette&#x27;s flag logo was revised for the new car and a small casting of a stingray was added to the car&#x27;s ornamentation.

Features of the new generation&#x27;s structure included a carbon fiber hood and removable roof panel. The fenders, doors, and rear quarter panels remained composite. At the rear of the car, the trademark round taillights changed to a more squarish form. The underbody panels were made of &quot;carbon-nano&quot; composite and it made use of a new aluminum frame that located the four wheels an inch farther apart, front to rear and side to side. Luggage space decreased by 33% from the previous generation&#x27;s. The overall weight of the car was not announced by General Motors for many months after its first showing in January 2013. Despite the increased use of aluminum and other light weight materials, numerous publications reported that the weight would remain essentially unchanged from that of the previous generation&#x27;s. In August 2013, the weight of the new Corvette was reported to be , meaning it would weigh more than the previous generation&#x27;s C6 ZR1 model (), which included a supercharger and intercooler.

Chevrolet announced the C7 Z06 at the 2014 Detroit Auto Show. The 2015 Z06 Corvette produced 650 hp from the supercharged LT4 aluminum 6.2 L V8 engine.

The new generation Corvette resurrected the &quot;Stingray&quot; name. Originally spelled &quot;Sting Ray&quot; on 1963 through 1967 models and &quot;Stingray&quot; from 1969 until 1976.

For the 2015 model, Chevrolet began offering a transaxle version of the 8L90 eight-speed automatic to replace the previous six-speed 6L80.


For the 2017 model year Chevrolet once again introduced the Grand Sport (GS) model. This model included Z06 wide-body styling features and suspension tuning along with the Z51 dry sump LT1 engine configuration. Grand Sport models were available in 10 exterior colors and could have the optional Heritage Package which included hash-mark fender graphics (available in six colors. As part of the introduction of the Grand Sport in Geneva, Switzerland, Chevrolet also announced a 2017 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport Collector Edition that was to be limited to 1,000 vehicles in total with 850 for the US Market. Final production numbers show 784 Coupes and 151 Convertibles were built; 935 total.

The $4,995 Z25 Option Package was a cosmetic upgrade that contained blue fender hash-marks, two-tone blue leather seating surfaces with a logo on the seat headrest, blue leather stitching, serialized edition numbered dash plaque, and carpeted floor mats with logo,

The ZR1 variant returned for the 2019 model year. The long block of its new LT5 was the same as the LT4, but the supercharger displacement was increased from 1.7 liters to 2.65 liters. The C7 ZR1 power output was 755 horsepower.

The last C7 Corvette (also making it the last front-engined Corvette), a black Z06, was auctioned off on June 28, 2019, for $2.7 million (~$ in ) at the Barrett-Jackson Northeast auction. The auction benefited the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, which helps pay off mortgages for the families of first responders that were killed in the line of duty and builds &quot;mortgage-free, accessible smart homes&quot; for injured service members.

=== Eighth generation (C8; 2020–present) ===

The 2020 Corvette C8 was the first Corvette to have a rear mid-engine configuration, GM&#x27;s first since the 1984 Pontiac Fiero. The base Stingray coupe was introduced on July 18, 2019, with three launch colors, red (with the Z51 Package), white, and blue, and the convertible on October 2 at the Kennedy Space Center, joined by the C8.R race car, which took part at the 2020 24 Hours of Daytona.

The base engine is the 6.2 liter naturally aspirated LT2 V8, which generates and of torque when equipped with either the performance exhaust package or Z51 performance package. The C8 is the first Corvette to be offered without a traditional manual transmission since all 1982 Corvettes were built with a 4-speed auto with overdrive, and the convertible is the first Corvette with a retractable hardtop.

In January 2020 the car became the most expensive charity vehicle that week at the Barrett-Jackson auction, selling for $3 million (~$ in ). The proceeds of the sale went to the Detroit Children&#x27;s Fund.

The LT2 saw fuel management system upgrades for the 2022 model year which featured a new fuel pump and injectors. The base price was also increased by $1200. A new IMSA GTLM Championship Edition package, limited to 1000 units, was introduced for 2022.

The Corvette C8 Z06 debuted in the 2023 model year. It features the LT6, a , 5.5 liter, DOHC flat-plane crank V8 – the most powerful naturally aspirated production V8. The Z06 is redlined at 8600 RPM and feature the same dual-clutch transmission as the Stingray, with gearing changes specific to the performance of this model.

The Corvette C8 E-Ray was unveiled on January 17, 2023, as a 2024 model year vehicle. It is the first production Corvette to include front wheel drive electric motor components. The Hybrid powertrain features a combined generated from a 6.2L LT2 V8, coupled with an e-motor powering the front wheels. It listed at over $122,000 before options.

The Corvette C8 ZR1 was unveiled on June 25, 2024, as a 2025 model year vehicle. It was referred to by Chevrolet as the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and featured 1064 horsepower and 828 lb-ft torque from a 5.5L twin turbo flat-plane crank V8. The car does 0-60 in 2.3 seconds and the quarter mile in 9.6 seconds at 150 mph. Both best ever figures for Corvette. The starting price for the C8 ZR1 was announced at $174,996 before options.

== Awards ==
Over the years, the Corvette has won awards from automobile publications as well as organizations such as the Society of Automotive Engineers.

== NASA Corvettes ==
Jim Rathmann, a Melbourne, Florida Chevrolet dealer and winner of the 1960 Indy 500, befriended astronauts Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, and Gordon Cooper. Rathmann convinced GM President Ed Cole to set up a program that supplied each astronaut with a pair of new cars each year. Most chose a family car for their wives and a Corvette for themselves. In his memoir &quot;Last Man On The Moon&quot;, Gene Cernan describes how this worked. The astronauts received brand-new Corvettes, which they were given the option to purchase at a &quot;used&quot; price after they had been driven . Alan Bean recalls Corvettes lined up in the parking lot outside the astronaut offices at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and friendly races between Shepard and Grissom along the Florida beach roads and on beaches as local police turned a blind eye. Shepard, Grissom and Cooper even pulled each other on skis in the shallow water. The Mercury and later astronauts were unofficially tied to the Corvette and appeared in official photographs with their cars and with mock-ups of space vehicles such as the Apollo Lunar Module or Lunar Roving Vehicle. Cooper talked of the races along Cocoa Beach in his eulogy of Shepard at the Johnson Space Center in 1998. Shepard, a long-time Corvette owner, was invited by then GM Chief Engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov to drive pre-production Corvette models. General Motors executives later gave Shepard a 1972 model with a Bill Mitchell interior.

== Concept cars ==
Corvette concept cars have inspired the designs of several generations of Corvettes. The first Corvette, Harley Earl&#x27;s 1953 EX-122 Corvette prototype was itself, a concept show car, first shown to the public at the 1953 GM Motorama at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City on January 17, 1953. It was brought to production in six months with only minor changes.

Harley Earl&#x27;s successor, Bill Mitchell was the man behind most of the Corvette concepts of the 1960s and 1970s. The second-generation (C2) of 1963 was his, and its design first appeared on the Stingray Racer of 1959. It made its public debut at Maryland&#x27;s Marlborough Raceway on April 18, 1959, powered by a V8 with experimental 11:1 compression aluminum cylinder heads and took fourth place. The concept car was raced through 1960 having only &quot;Sting Ray&quot; badges before it was put on the auto-show circuit in 1961.

In 1961 the XP-755 Mako Shark show car was designed by Larry Shinoda as a concept for future Corvettes. In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired by the look of that very fast fish. The 1961 Corvette tail was given two additional tail lights (six total) for the concept car. The body inspired the 1963 production Sting Ray.

In 1965 Mitchell removed the original concept body and redesigned it as the Mako Shark II. Chevrolet created two of them, only one of which was fully functional. The original Mako Shark was then retroactively called the Mako Shark I. The Mako Shark II debuted in 1965 as a show car and this concept influenced Mitchell&#x27;s redesigned Corvette of 1968.

The Aerovette has a mid-engine configuration using a transverse mounting of its V8 engine. Zora Arkus-Duntov&#x27;s engineers originally built two XP-882s during 1969. John DeLorean, Chevy general manager, ordered one for display at the 1970 New York Auto Show. In 1972, DeLorean authorized further work on the XP-882. A near-identical body in aluminum alloy was constructed and became the XP-895 &quot;Reynolds Aluminum Car.&quot; Duntov and Mitchell responded with two Chevrolet Vega (stillborn) Wankel two-rotor engines joined as a four-rotor engine which was used to power the XP-895. It was first shown in late 1973. The four-rotor show car was outfitted with a small-block V8 in 1977 and rechristened Aerovette. GM chairman Thomas Murphy approved the Aerovette for 1980 production, but Mitchell&#x27;s retirement that year, combined with then Corvette chief engineer Dave McLellan&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for the mid-engine design and slow-selling data on mid-engined cars kept it from going into production.

A Corvette Stingray Anniversary concept car was unveiled at the 2009 Detroit Auto Show, fifty years after the Sting Ray racer-concept of 1959. The vehicle was based on a combination of the 1963 Sting Ray and the 1968 Stingray. The new Stingray concept appears in the 2009 movie &quot;&quot;, as the vehicle mode of the character Sideswipe. A convertible/speedster version was used for the same character in the 2011 sequel, &quot;&quot;.

== Production ==
Production statistics from when the first-generation of Corvettes was released in 1953 until the present.

== Owner demographics ==
According to research by Specialty Equipment Market Association and Experian Automotive, as of 2009, there were approximately 750,000 Corvettes of all model years registered in the United States. Corvette owners were fairly equally distributed throughout the country, with the highest density in Michigan (3.47 per 1000 residents) and the lowest density in Utah, Mississippi, and Hawaii (1.66, 1.63, and 1.53 registrations per 1000 residents). 47% of them hold college degrees (significantly above the nationwide average of 27%), and 82% are between the ages of 40 and 69 (median age being 53).

== Racing ==

=== C1 ===

In 1960, three C-1 Corvettes were race modified and entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans by team owner Briggs Cunningham and were numbered #1, #2, and #3 cars in the race. The numbered #3 car was driven by John Fitch and Bob Grossman and it had finished the race in eighth place overall, but it had won the big-bore GT class.

=== C5-R ===

The Chevrolet Corvette C5-R is a grand touring racing car built by Pratt &amp; Miller and General Motors for competition in endurance racing. The car is based on the C5 generation of the Chevrolet Corvette sports car, yet is designed purely for motorsports use. It became one of the most dominant cars in GT categories, with wins at the 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, and 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as championships in the American Le Mans Series. The Corvette C5-Rs debuted in 1999 and continues to be raced to this day, although the C5-R has effectively been replaced by the Corvette C6.R.

=== C6.R ===

C6.R GT1 (Z06)
In 2005, the factory Corvette Team began racing the C6.R to coincide with the new sixth-generation (C6) Corvette being released to the public. Private teams, primarily in Europe, continued to race the C5-R for a couple of years before switching to the C6.R. Corvette C6.R went on to win its class at every race it entered in the 2005 ALMS season. By the end of 2009, Corvette had clinched four consecutive ALMS GT1 team and manufacturers titles (2005–2008) and three Le Mans 24 Hour class victories in the LMGT1 category (2005, 2006, 2009). 2007 and 2008 races were won by the factory Aston Martin squad&#x27;s DBR9. The last official race for factory GT1 Corvettes was the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans.

C6.R GT2 (ZR1)
While some privateers continued to use the GT1 version of the C6.R in Europe, the official factory team Corvette Racing switched from the slowly dying GT1 category to the much more competitive and popular GT2 class in mid-2009. The new GT2 C6.R used a modified version of the ZR1 model body but does not have the ZR1 supercharged engine. GT2 rules are based more on production vehicles, therefore the GT2 C6.R naturally aspirated engine was considerably more restricted and less powerful than its predecessor. The car debuted at Mid-Ohio&#x27;s ALMS round. They achieved one ALMS race victory in the remaining 2009 ALMS season, and one victory at the final round of the 2010 ALMS season, Petit Le Mans. Corvette Racing&#x27;s two GT2 C6.Rs also led most of the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans, but both cars were forced to retire. Racing in the new GTE Pro class, the C6.R raced in the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans with the No. 73 car taking the class victory. The No. 74 car led the class for most of the race but crashed in the morning hours. The C6.R raced by Larbre Competition also took the GTE Am class victory. In 2012, Corvette Racing returned to glory in the ALMS winning 4 of 10 races and claiming the Driver&#x27;s, Team, and Manufacturer&#x27;s Championships. Corvette Racing repeated the feat in 2013 by winning 5 of 10 races and claiming the Driver&#x27;s, Team, and Manufacturer&#x27;s Championships again.

=== C7.R ===

IN 2014, Corvette Racing introduced the new C7.R to coincide with the launch of the seventh-generation C7 Corvette. The car made its track debut at the 2013 Rolex Motorsports Reunion and later participated in the 2014 Roar Before the Rolex 24 to prepare for the 2014 United SportsCar Championship. The car&#x27;s new livery debuted at the 2014 North American International Auto Show. In 2015, the Corvette Racing C7.R took class victories at both the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

=== C8.R ===

In October 2019, at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, the C8.R made its surprise debut during the world premiere of the C8 Convertible. Two cars took part in the 2020 Rolex 24 at Daytona International Speedway. The cars placed 4th and 7th in the GTLM Class. For the 2022 model year, Chevrolet offered a C8.R inspired IMSA GTLM Special Edition package for the production Corvette Stingray.

=== Indianapolis 500 pace cars ===
The Indianapolis 500 race has used a Corvette as its pace car 18 times. The 2008 running of the Indy 500 represented a record fifth-consecutive year to lead the field until 2009 when the Chevrolet Camaro SS was selected. The Corvette&#x27;s pace car years and details include:

<text>The &quot;Visby&quot; class is a series of corvettes in use by the Swedish Navy. It is the latest class of corvette adopted by the navy after the - and corvettes. Its design emphasizes low visibility radar cross-section and infrared signature, and the class has received widespread international attention because of its capabilities as a stealth ship. The first ship in the class is named after Visby, the main city on the island of Gotland.

The &quot;Visby&quot; ships are designed by Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) and built by Saab Kockums AB in Karlskrona. The first ship of the class was launched in 2000, but production then suffered repeated delays. The fifth and final ship was delivered in 2015.

==Design==
The hull is constructed with a sandwich design consisting of a PVC core with a carbon fibre and vinyl laminate (see also the Oceanic-Creations spin-off). There are multiple advantages to using composite materials in ship hulls. Good conductivity and surface flatness mean a low radar signature, while good heat insulation lowers the infrared signature and increases survivability in case of fire. The composite sandwich used is also non-magnetic, which lowers the magnetic signature. Composites are also very strong for their relative weight, and less weight means a higher top speed and better maneuverability. The composite weighs roughly 50% less than the equivalent strength steel.

&quot;Visby&quot;″s angular tumblehome design reduces its radar signature. Jan Nilsson, one of the designers, told BBC News Online: &quot;We are able to reduce the radar cross-section by 99%. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s 99% invisible, it means that we have reduced its detection range.&quot; The 57 mm cannon barrel can be folded into the turret to reduce its cross-section.

==History==
Much of the design was based on the experiences learned from the experimental ship . The class was originally designed to be divided into two subcategories where the last ship was optimized for surface combat and 4 others for submarine hunting; however, this was changed due to cutbacks.

A helicopter, such as the Agusta Westland A109M selected by Sweden, can land, take off, and refuel on the upper deck. A helicopter hangar was originally planned but was considered to be too cramped and was removed.

The ships took an exceptionally long time from launch to delivery and the construction has been fraught with repeated delays. In 2008, the only weapons system that had been integrated and tested in &quot;Visby&quot; was the gun.

Finally, on 16 December 2009, the next two of the corvettes were delivered to the Swedish Navy by the Försvarets materielverk (FMV). The two ships, K32 and K33, were delivered with underwater and surface/air sensors fully integrated. However, the only weapon that had been integrated and test-fired on the ships was still the Bofors 57 Mk3 gun, FMV calls this version 4.

Version 5 supplemented the ships with mine clearance systems, helicopter landing capability, anti-surface ship missiles, and additional stealth adaptation. &quot;Visby&quot; was the first of the corvettes to be upgraded to Version 5. On 22 March 2012 FMV reported that the ship had been modified and that the system would be tested before reentering the Swedish Navy by the end of 2012.

Although the design of the ships originally called for the installation of surface-to-air missiles, on 18 September 2008 the Genomförandegruppen cancelled the project to rationalize the procurement of defence materiel for the Swedish defence.

=== Mid-life upgrade ===
In January 2021 Saab and the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration (FMV) signed a contract for the mid-life upgrade of the five &quot;Visby&quot; corvettes. The MLU will include the installation of surface-to-air missiles, the implementation of upgraded anti-ship missiles and anti-submarine torpedoes, improved sensors and enhanced electronic warfare capabilities. The upgrade of all five ships will be completed before 2030 and the MLU aims to keep the &quot;Visby&quot; corvettes operationally relevant beyond 2040.

To be fitted with CAMM surface-to-air missiles.

===Cancelled second generation===

In January 2021 FMV and SAAB also signed an agreement for the product definition phase of the &quot;Visby&quot; Generation 2 corvettes. The new corvettes were to be equipped with modern anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and anti-submarine torpedoes. Four Visby Gen 2 corvettes would be built with the first two ships scheduled for delivery to the Swedish Navy around the year 2030 with the latter two ships being delivered sometime between 2031 and 2035. Rear admiral Ewa Skoog Haslum stated that the &quot;Visby&quot; generation 2 corvettes would be larger than the current &quot;Visby&quot; corvettes, with increased range and crew complement being the main reasons for this change. In 2021, an order was placed for the development of this second generation of evolved &quot;Visby&quot; corvettes.

On 1 November 2022, the supreme commander of the Swedish armed forces, General Micael Bydén, published his recommendations for how the armed forces should grow over the coming years at the request of the Swedish government. This included the recommendation that the &quot;Visby&quot; Gen 2 corvettes should be equipped with longer-range surface-to-air missiles than those which will be used on the &quot;Visby Gen 1&quot; in order for the ships to be able to act as part of NATO integrated air and missile defences. Further recommendations included modifications to the ships to increase their interoperability with both NATO&#x27;s standing maritime groups and the Joint Expeditionary Force.

In early 2023 it was reported that the &quot;Visby&quot; gen 2 had been cancelled in favour of the clean sheet . The changing needs of the Swedish Navy as well as concerns about potential delays that could arise from modifying the Visby-class design were the main reasons given for the cancellation.

== Units ==
All systems for the ship &quot;Uddevalla&quot; were acquired, but the ship was later cancelled.

<text>Colmar (, ; Alsatian: &#x27; ; [[German language|German]]:&#x27;) is a city and commune in the Haut-Rhin department and Alsace region of north-eastern France. The third-largest commune in Alsace (after Strasbourg and Mulhouse), it is the seat of the prefecture of the Haut-Rhin department and of the subprefecture of the Colmar-Ribeauvillé arrondissement.

The city is renowned for its well-preserved old town, its numerous architectural landmarks and its museums, among which is the Unterlinden Museum, which houses the &quot;Isenheim Altarpiece&quot;.

Colmar is located on the Alsatian Wine Route and considers itself to be the capital of Alsatian wine (&quot;&quot;).

==History==
Colmar was first mentioned by Charlemagne in his chronicle about Saxon wars. This was the location where the Carolingian Emperor Charles the Fat held a diet in 884. Colmar was granted the status of a free imperial city by Emperor Frederick II in 1226. In 1354 it joined the Décapole city league. The city adopted the Protestant Reformation in 1575, long after the northern neighbours of Strasbourg and Sélestat. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, it was taken by the Swedish army in 1632, which held it for two years. In 1634, the Schoeman family arrived and started the first town library. In 1635, the city&#x27;s harvest was spoiled by Imperialist forces while the residents shot at them from the walls.

The city was conquered by France under King Louis XIV in 1673 and officially ceded by the 1679 Treaties of Nijmegen. In 1854 a cholera epidemic killed many in the city. With the rest of Alsace, Colmar was ceded to the newly formed German Empire in 1871 as a result of the Franco-Prussian War and incorporated into the Alsace-Lorraine province. It returned to France after World War I according to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1940, and then reverted to French control after the battle of the &quot;Colmar Pocket&quot; in 1945. Colmar has been continuously governed by conservative parties since 1947, the Popular Republican Movement (1947–1977), the Union for French Democracy (1977–1995) and the Union for a Popular Movement (since 1995), and has had only three mayors during that time.

The Colmar Treasure, a hoard of precious objects hidden by Jews during the Black Death, was discovered here in 1863.

==Geography==
Colmar is south-southwest of Strasbourg, at 48.08°N, 7.36°E, on the River Lauch, a tributary of the Ill. It is located immediately to the east of the Vosges and connected to the Rhine in the east by a canal.

In 2017 the city had a population of 69,105, and the metropolitan area of Colmar had a population of 199,234 in 2018. Colmar is the centre of the arrondissement of Colmar-Ribeauvillé, which had 211,312 inhabitants in 2017.

==Climate==

Colmar has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) but it is significantly modified by the city&#x27;s location far inland, with cold, dry winters and warm to hot, wetter summers.

The city has a sunny microclimate and is one of the driest cities in France, with an annual precipitation of just , making it ideal for Alsace wine. It is considered the capital of the Alsatian wine region.

The dryness results from the town&#x27;s location next to mountains, which forces clouds arriving from the west to rise and much of their moisture to condense and fall over the higher ground, leaving the air warmed and dried by the time it reaches Colmar.

The city therefore has more of a continental climate and winter and summer temperatures can sometimes be the lowest or highest in France.
&lt;br&gt;
==Population==

==Main sights==

Mostly spared from the destructions of the French Revolution and the wars of 1870–1871, 1914–1918 and 1939–1945, the cityscape of old-town Colmar is homogenous and renowned among tourists. An area that is crossed by canals of the river Lauch (which formerly served as the butcher&#x27;s, tanner&#x27;s and fishmonger&#x27;s quarter) is now called &quot;little Venice&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

===Library===
The Municipal Library of Colmar (&quot;) owns one of the richest collections of incunabula in France, with more than 2,300 volumes. This is quite an exceptional number for a city that is neither the main seat of a university, nor of a college, and has its explanation in the dissolution of local monasteries, abbeys and convents during the French Revolution and the subsequent gift of their collections to the town.

==Transport==
The small regional Colmar Airport serves Colmar.

The railway station Gare de Colmar offers connections to Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Besançon, Zürich and several regional destinations. Colmar was also once linked to Freiburg im Breisgau, in Germany and on the other side of the Rhine, by the Freiburg–Colmar international railway. However the railway bridge over the Rhine between Breisach and Neuf-Brisach was destroyed in 1945 and never replaced.

The &quot;École Compleméntaire Pour L&#x27;Enseignement Japonaise à Colmar&quot; (コルマール補習授業校 &quot;Korumāru Hoshū Jugyō Kō&quot;), a part-time supplementary Japanese school, is held in Colmar. At one time classes were held at the &quot;Centre Cultural de Seijo&quot;.

==Music==
Since 1980, Colmar is home to an international summer festival of classical music &#x27; (also known as &#x27;). In its first version (1980 to 1989), it was placed under the artistic direction of the German conductor Karl Münchinger. Since 1989, it is helmed by the Russian violinist and conductor Vladimir Spivakov.

==Economy==

Colmar is an affluent city whose primary economic strength lies in the flourishing tourist industry. But it is also the seat of several large companies: Timken (European seat), Liebherr (French seat), Leitz (French seat), Capsugel France (A division of Pfizer).

Every year since 1947, Colmar is host to what is now considered as the biggest annual commercial event as well as the largest festival in Alsace, the &quot;Foire aux vins d&#x27;Alsace&quot; (Alsacian wine fair).

When Air Alsace existed, its head office was on the grounds of Colmar Airport.

<doc id="221026" wikidata="Q553446" url="?curid=221026" title="Fabre d'Églantine">
<text>Philippe François Nazaire Fabre d&#x27;Églantine (; 28 July 1750 – 5 April 1794), commonly known as Fabre d&#x27;Églantine, was a French actor, dramatist, poet, and politician of the French Revolution.

He is best known for having invented the names of the months in the French Republican calendar, and for the song Il pleut, il pleut, bergère which is still a popular nursery rhyme today.

==Early life==
He was born in Carcassonne, Aude. His surname was Fabre, the &quot;d&#x27;Églantine&quot; being added in commemoration of his receiving a silver wild rose () from Clémence Isaure from the Academy of the &quot;Jeux Floraux&quot; at Toulouse. He married Marie Strasbourg Nicole Godin on 9 November 1778. His earliest works included the poem &quot;Étude de la nature&quot;, &quot;The Study of Nature&quot;, in 1783. After travelling in the provinces as an actor, he came to Paris, where he produced an unsuccessful comedy entitled &quot;Les Gens de lettres, ou Le provincial à Paris&quot; (1787).

A tragedy, &quot;Augusta&quot;, produced at the &quot;Théâtre Français&quot;, also proved a failure. Many of his plays were popular and he is remarked as one of the most important playwrights during the French Revolution. His most popular play was: &quot;Philinte, ou La suite du Misanthrope&quot; (1790), supposed to be a continuation of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Misanthrope&quot;, but the hero of the piece is a different character from the nominal prototype —a pure and simple egotist. On its publication, the play was introduced by a preface, in which the author satirises &quot;L&#x27;Optimiste&quot; of his rival Jean François Collin d&#x27;Harleville, whose &quot;Châteaux en Espagne&quot; had gained the applause which Fabre&#x27;s &quot;Présomptueux&quot; (1789) had failed to win. The character of Philinte had much political significance. The play&#x27;s character Alceste received the highest praise, and stands for the patriot citizen, while Philinte is a dangerous aristocrat in disguise.
Fabre constructed the play to represent what he envisioned as the new relationship between theater and society. Not only did Fabre believe that Old Regime society was bankrupt; Old Regime comedy was viewed by the budding playwright as equally without value. Fabre d’Eglantine believed that he could fashion a place for theater in revolutionary culture and redeem French drama by developing a new form of theater that would promote the new social order of equality and fraternity. He found his justification and framework in Rousseaus’s critique of theatricality and advocated transparency as the critical transformative element that could generate theater worthy of and in keeping with revolutionary culture. As envisioned by Fabre, evolutionary political institutions would not shape theater; rather, a regenerated revolutionary theatrical culture would redeem the work of art, generating a new, revolutionary society.

==Political activity==
Fabre served as president and secretary of the club of the Cordeliers, and belonged also to the Jacobin Club. Georges Danton chose Fabre as his private secretary, and he sat in the National Convention of 1792-1794. D&#x27;Églantine voted for the death of King Louis XVI, supporting the &quot;maximum&quot; and a law which allowed for summary executions, and he was a bitter enemy of the Girondins.

After the death of Jean-Paul Marat (13 July 1793), Fabre published &quot;Portrait de l&#x27;Ami du Peuple&quot;.

On the abolition of the Gregorian Calendar in France he sat on the committee entrusted with the creation of the French Republic&#x27;s French Republican Calendar. The calendar was designed by the politician and agronomist Gilbert Romme, although it is usually attributed to Fabre d&#x27;Eglantine, who invented the names of the months. This Calendar featured a ten-day week so that Sunday would be forgotten as a religious day, and the months were named after the intrinsic qualities of the seasons. He contributed a large part of the new nomenclature; for example, the months of &quot;Prairial&quot; and &quot;Floréal&quot;, as well as the days &quot;Primidi&quot; and &quot;Duodi&quot;. The report which he made on the subject, on 24 October 1793, described the aim of the commission as &quot;to substitute for visions of ignorance the realities of reason, and for sacerdotal prestige the truth of nature,&quot; to exalt &quot;the agricultural system…by marking the days and the divisions of the year with intelligible or visible signs taken from agriculture and rural life.&quot;

==Execution and legacy==
Early on the morning of 14 November 1793, the Montagnard and former friar François Chabot burst into Maximilien Robespierre&#x27;s bedroom dragging him from bed with accusations of counter-revolution and conspiracy, waving a hundred thousand livres in assignat notes, claiming that a band of royalist plotters gave it to him to buy Fabre d&#x27;Eglantine&#x27;s vote, along with others, to liquidate some stock in an overseas trading concern.

The fraud that he spoke of regarding Fabre had been carried out in early October, when the French East India Company had been liquidated in accordance with the anti-capitalist legislation of the summer. The decree had apparently been falsified so that the directors were blackmailed into turning over the half-million-livre profits of this exercise to the cabal of the Convention members responsible. In 1794, Robespierre had evidence of Fabre&#x27;s criminality and he denounced Fabre for what he viewed as a particular heinous crime, criminality disguised by patriotism.

On 12 January 1794 Fabre was arrested by order of the Committee of Public Safety on a charge of malversation and forgery in connection with the affairs of the French East India Company. This struck a hard blow to the Montagnards and sent them on their way to extinction in the Convention. During his trial, d&#x27;Eglantine was asked to testify in his own defense and tried to twist the facts around, accusing other people, but was unsuccessful. According to legend, Fabre showed the greatest calmness and sang his own well-known song:

&quot;Il pleut, il pleut, bergère,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;rentre tes blancs moutons.&quot;

Fabre died under the guillotine on 5 April 1794 with the other Dantonists. On his way to the scaffold he distributed his handwritten poems to the people.

According to a popular legend, Fabre complained bitterly about the injustice done to him on the way to the scaffold, whereupon Danton replied with supreme sarcasm: &quot;&quot;Des vers... Avant huit jours, tu en feras plus que tu n&#x27;en voudras!&quot; (&quot;Before eight days have passed, you&#x27;ll make more of them than you would like to&quot;), where &quot;them&quot; (&quot;vers&quot;) can be understood as either &quot;verses&quot; or &quot;worms&quot;&quot;.

A posthumous play, &quot;Les Précepteurs&quot;, using the themes of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, was performed on 17 September 1794 and met with an enthusiastic reception. Among Fabre&#x27;s other plays are &quot;Le Convalescent de qualité&quot; (1791), and &quot;L&#x27;Intrigue épistolaire&quot; (1791, supposedly including a depiction of the painter Jean-Baptiste Greuze). The author&#x27;s &quot;Œuvres mêlées et posthumes&quot; were first published at Paris in 1802 in two volumes.

<doc id="221028" wikidata="Q665606" url="?curid=221028" title="Plains-wanderer">
<text>The plains-wanderer (Pedionomus torquatus) is a bird, the only representative of family Pedionomidae and genus Pedionomus. It is endemic to Australia. Its historic range included much of eastern Australia, including Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory, but in recent years, it has become endangered with remaining known populations concentrated in the Riverina region of New South Wales and western Queensland.

==Description==
The plains-wanderer is a quail-like ground bird, measuring 15–19 cm. It is such an atypical bird that it is placed in an entire family of its own, Pedionomidae. The adult male is light brown above, with fawn-white underparts with black crescents. The adult female is substantially larger than the male, and has a distinctive, white-spotted black collar. They have excellent camouflage and will first hide at any disturbance. If approached too closely, they will run rather than fly, at which they are very poor. Females lay four eggs, which the male then incubates.

==Taxonomy==
It was formerly believed to be related to the buttonquails and thus placed in the gamebird order Galliformes or with the cranes and rails in Gruiformes. DNA–DNA hybridization and RAG-1 sequence data places it as a wader related to the jacanas. It thus represents a remarkable case of morphological convergence, or perhaps it is simply extremely plesiomorphic in morphology (the buttonquails, meanwhile, having turned out to be a very basal offshoot of the wader radiation). In the latter case, this would mean that the jacanas, painted snipe and seedsnipes—all ecologically very different birds—all evolved from birds very similar to the living plains-wanderer.

==Status and conservation==
Population decline has been caused by the conversion of native grasslands to cultivation and intensive predation by the introduced fox—the species&#x27; ground-nesting habits, poor flying ability, and tendency to run rather than fly from predators make it easy prey for the fox. Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for plains-wanderer conservation are Boolcoomatta, Bindarrah and Kalkaroo Stations in north-eastern South Australia, Diamantina and Astrebla Grasslands in western Queensland, Patho Plains in northern Victoria and the Riverina Plains in New South Wales. 

A crucial aspect of Plains-wanderer conservation is their habitat needs. They require grasslands with both open and denser vegetation for foraging and roosting, which is essential for their survival and recovery.

===International===
This bird is listed as Endangered on the 2022 IUCN Red List.

===Australia===
Plains-wanderers are listed as critically endangered under the Australian &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (EPBC Act). Their conservation status varies from state to state within Australia: 

* New South Wales: Endangered, under the &quot;Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (NSW)&quot; (February 2022 list)
* Queensland: Critically Endangered, under Nature Conservation (Animals) Regulation 2020 (November 2021 list)
* South Australia: Endangered, under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; (January 2020 list)
* Victoria: Critically Endangered, under the &quot;Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988&quot; (October 2021 list)

A 2018 study ranked it sixth in a list of Australian birds most likely to go extinct.

=== Conservation efforts ===
A captive population was established in late 2018 within a purpose-built facility containing 30 aviaries at Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo. These captive individuals will form an insurance population as part of a breed-and-release program to support the wild population, as part of the national conservation plan for the species.

<text>The Lake Washington Ship Canal is a canal that runs through the city of Seattle and connects the fresh water body of Lake Washington to the salt water inland sea of Puget Sound. The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks accommodate the approximately difference in water level between Lake Washington and the sound. The canal runs east–west and connects Union Bay, the Montlake Cut, Portage Bay, Lake Union, the Fremont Cut, Salmon Bay, and Shilshole Bay, which is part of the sound.

The ship canal project began in 1911 and was officially completed in 1934. Prior to construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, otherwise known as the Salmon Bay Waterway, water used to exit Lake Washington via the Black River which flowed from the south end of Lake Washington into the Duwamish River.

As early as 1854, there was discussion of building a navigable connection between Lake Washington and Puget Sound for the purpose of transporting logs, milled lumber, and fishing vessels. Thirteen years later, the United States Navy endorsed a canal project, which included a plan for building a naval shipyard on Lake Washington. In 1891 the US Army Corps of Engineers started planning the project. Some preliminary work was begun in 1906, and work began in earnest five years later. The delays in canal planning and construction resulted in the U.S. Navy building the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, which is located across the Sound from Seattle.

===Early efforts ===
For centuries, people had been dragging boats between the lakes, giving names like &quot;carry a canoe&quot; &quot;sxWátSadweehL&quot; to the crossing points. In 1854 Seattle pioneer Thomas Mercer proposed canals connecting Lake Union and Lake Washington to Puget Sound in a speech at the first Independence Day celebration of the Seattle area&#x27;s first permanent white settlement, shortly after its founding. Mercer gave the lakes the names they are presently called, over the original Lushootseed names used by the Duwamish, &quot;tenas Chuck&quot; or &quot;XáXu7cHoo&quot; (&quot;small great-amount-of-water&quot;) for Lake Union and &quot;hyas Chuck&quot; or &quot;Xacuabš&quot; (&quot;great-amount-of-water&quot;) for Lake Washington. Lake Union was chosen to suggest the future canals merging the waters, and Lake Washington for George Washington.

In 1860 local landowner Harvey L. Pike tried to dig a ditch by himself with pick and shovel at Montlake to transport logs between Portage Bay and Union Bay, in the hopes of increasing the value of his property along the route. Giving up on digging the first Portage Canal himself, in 1871 he joined Thomas Burke and Daniel Gilman in incorporating the Lake Washington Canal Company, deeding his land to the company. Instead of finishing the canal, the company instead built a tramway to carry coal brought by barge across Lake Washington. In 1883, David Denny and Burke hired a crew of Chinese laborers to complete the canal at Montlake, creating a channel that included a lock, capable of floating logs down from Lake Washington to Lake Union.

The Army Corps of Engineers investigated Puget Sound for military defense purposes and chose Lake Washington as the best location for a Naval base, due to the security of the waters, proximity to supplies of fresh water, coal and timber, and the less corrosive effect on wooden ship hulls of a fresh water port. A report by Lieutenant Thomas H. Hardy of October 13, 1871, forwarded to Congress by Army General Barton S. Alexander of the Board of Engineers of the Pacific Coast said the coal fields of Seattle Coal and Transportation Company, two miles east of Lake Sammamish, supplied 1,500 tons per month of steam ship grade coal, and potentially twice this amount. The route directly across the narrowest part of Seattle, that is, Semple&#x27;s Canal from Leschi straight across to present-day Harbor Island, was rejected in this report because of the 200 to 300 foot height of the hills that would have to be cut through. The route via the Black and Duwamish Rivers would be crooked and several miles in length, would let out into shoals rather than deep water, and would have to be frequently dredged to remove sand brought by river flooding. As to connecting Lake Union to Shilshole Bay—the route ultimately chosen—Gen. Alexander had &quot;serious objections&quot;, including the expense and the need for dredging a channel, and that the canal line let out in shoal water that was exposed to heavy seas, and would be less defensible in wartime, being &quot;exposed to the cannonade of an enemy&quot;. Alexander was less opposed to digging straight south from Salmon Bay through Interbay to Smith Cove, but would still terminate in shoals and be just as costly as his preferred route from Lake Union through Mercer&#x27;s Farm into Elliott Bay, while being less defensible. The estimated cost for the project was $4.7 million.

In the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1902, Congress directed the Secretary of War to appoint a committee of three officers to study the feasibility of a canal and lock system to connect Puget Sound to Lake Washington. Lieutenant Colonel William H. Heuer, Captain William C. Langfitt and Lieutenant Robert P. Johnson met August, 1902 in Seattle and conducted a survey of possible routes. They examined the route of the Lake Washington Waterway Company, via Shilshole Bay, as well as a route from Lake Union to Smith Cove, the Montlake coal tramway, and Thomas Mercer&#x27;s farm. In November 1902, a public meeting was called in the Chamber of Commerce hall, but was quickly adjourned because no one came to speak.

In 1906, as local debate over the location of the canals continued, and funding from Washington, D.C. was delayed, Seattle developer James A. Moore, known today for the Moore Theatre and Moore Haven, Florida, proposed a canal that could accommodate small ships, with two wooden locks connecting Salmon Bay to Shilshole Bay. Moore secured Congressional approval for his project, granting him rights to build. In April of the same year, Hiram M. Chittenden came to Seattle as the new Army District Engineer. Chittenden favored the same route to Shilshole Bay as Moore, but found the plan too modest, and potentially unsafe. Chittenden said Moore&#x27;s hope-for budget of $500,000 was insufficient, and the locks should be built to accommodate larger vessels, and that the wooden locks would eventually deteriorate and collapse, draining Lake Washington into Puget Sound.

Instead, Chittenden proposed a double concrete lock with steel gates, allowing small craft to pass with less waste. A single set of locks on the western end of Salmon Bay would be used in place of the small wooden lock near Fremont Avenue, which would lower Lake Washington to the same level as Lake Union. Having a single lock between Puget Sound and the freshwater lakes would reduce the risk of flooding and reduce overall cost of the project. Before he could move forward, Chittenden had to sway local leaders away from supporting Moore&#x27;s project. After enthusiasm for his canal eroded and funding dried up, Moore transferred his rights to a public-private entity, the Lake Washington Canal Association, in 1907. Though Chittenden hoped to cap his career with the construction of the Locks, ill health forced him to retire in 1909, though he continued lobbying Congress for the project, and served as a consulting engineer and as a Seattle port commissioner until his death in October 1917.

===Ballard Locks construction===
==Navigation==

===Traffic===

Navigation starts at Webster Point in Lake Washington and continues to Shilshole Bay. Speed limit is 7 knots with more restrictions including 2.5 knots for entering and exiting the locks. Canal traffic signals present 1,000 feet (304.8 m) each side of the Montlake Bridge and east of the Fremont bridge and west of the Ballard Bridge. Vessels 300 tons (272.15 metric tons) and vessels with a tow may not pass a red signal. Other Vessels should use caution for on coming large commercial traffic.

===Drawbridges===
All bridges can be contacted on channel 13 for an opening or use horn. Horn blasts of one long, at least four seconds, and one short, of about a second, can be used to request an opening. A reciprocal response from a bridge is acknowledgement that the information has been received and the bridge will open in time. Bridges may hold for up to ten minutes before opening, and longer at certain times of the day five short blast from a bridge means that the bridge will not be opening.

Non-self-propelled vessels must be towed by a suitable self-propelled vessel past the bridge.

==Sewage and stormwater mitigation==

During heavy or prolonged rain, stormwater runoff and overflowing wastewater from neighborhoods along the Ship Canal is dumped into the waterway. The practice was found to be polluting Salmon Bay and Puget Sound with an average of 130 spills per year dumping of untreated wastewater. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Washington State Department of Ecology ordered the Seattle city government to address the issue, signing a consent decree in 2016 to plan a diversion system. The system will use a tunnel running along the north side of the canal with access stations at five sites in Fremont, northern Queen Anne, and Ballard before reaching a pump station, where wastewater can continue to the West Point sewage treatment plant. The pump station in Ballard is planned to be a cylinder covered in a steel lattice structure that reaches in height; it is expected to cost $100 million. The tower&#x27;s design evokes the local maritime industry and is inspired by crab pots; the lattice will include light-emitting diodes that are programmed to display colors that represent local weather or the pumping station&#x27;s status.

The project is expected to cost $570 million to construct, with 65 percent of funding sourced from Seattle Public Utilities and the remaining 35 percent from the King County government. The project had originally been estimated to cost $423 million, but limited supply in the area&#x27;s busy construction market caused cost overruns. Construction on the tunnel began in June 2021 with the launch of a tunnel boring machine, named &quot;Mudhoney&quot; in honor of the local grunge band following a public contest. Tunnel boring from Ballard to Wallingford was completed in June 2023 and construction is scheduled to be completed in 2026.

==Canal crossings==
The Canal&#x27;s crossings, from east to west, are:
* the University Link Tunnel carrying Link light rail under the canal
* the Montlake Bridge carrying State Route 513 (Montlake Boulevard NE) over the Montlake Cut
* the University Bridge carrying Eastlake Avenue over Portage Bay
* the Ship Canal Bridge carrying Interstate 5 over Portage Bay
* the George Washington Memorial Bridge (commonly called the Aurora Bridge) carrying Aurora Avenue N. (State Route 99) over the west end of Lake Union
* the Fremont Bridge connecting 4th Avenue N. to Fremont Avenue N. over the Fremont Cut
* Northern Pacific Railroad Ship Canal Bridge near the west end of the Fremont Cut 1914–1976, no longer extant.
* the Ballard Bridge carrying 15th Avenue over Salmon Bay
* pedestrian crossing only at the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks
* the BNSF Railway&#x27;s Salmon Bay Bridge over Salmon Bay

An additional crossing for transit, bicycles, and pedestrians between the Ballard and Fremont bridges was proposed by Mayor Mike McGinn in 2012, but funding to study its feasibility were rejected by the Seattle City Council. A new Link light rail crossing, carrying the Ballard Link Extension near the existing Ballard Bridge, is planned to be constructed in the 2030s.

==Seattle landmarks==
The Lake Washington Ship Canal and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Montlake Cut, along with the Montlake Bridge are City of Seattle Designated Landmarks (ID #107995).

<doc id="221043" wikidata="Q6625169" url="?curid=221043" title="List of law schools in the United States">
<text>Law schools in this list are categorized by whether they are currently active or closed; within each section they are listed in alphabetical order by state, then name. Most of these law schools grant the Juris Doctor degree, commonly abbreviated JD, which is the typical first professional degree in law in the United States. Alaska is currently the only state without a law school.

Law schools are nationally accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA), and graduates of these schools may generally sit for the bar exam in any state. There are 198 ABA accredited law schools, along with one law school provisionally accredited by the ABA. The ABA occasionally revokes accreditation, as was done mostly recently with the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in 2019.

In the past decade, since 2014, 11 law schools have closed, with the most recent closing, of Golden Gate University School of Law, announced in fall 2023.

In addition, individual state legislatures or bar examiners, like the State Bar of California, may maintain a separate accreditation system which is open to non-ABA accredited schools. The California State Bar also accredits law schools, which the California Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE) recognizes. Also, the CBE allows registered &quot;Unaccredited&quot; schools to operate and students of those schools are eligible to take the California Bar Examination upon graduation.

Twelve correspondence and online law schools, although not accredited, are registered by the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California. This means that the graduates of these distance learning law schools can sit for the California Bar Examination and, under varying circumstances, the bar exams in many other states.

<doc id="221045" wikidata="Q6625150" url="?curid=221045" title="List of law schools in Canada">
<text>A number of law schools in Canada operate as a faculty or as an affiliated school to a Canadian public university. Twenty law schools offer common law schooling, whereas seven schools offer schooling in the civil law system. Although the judicial system in most Canadian provinces operate under a common law system, the province of Quebec uses the civil law system for private law matters. As a result, most Canadian law schools that offer schooling in civil law are based in Quebec.

==Legal education in Canada==
Generally, entry into law programs in Canada is based primarily on a combination of the student&#x27;s previous grades as well as, for English-language common-law programs, their score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). Factors such as specialized degrees, work experience, community involvement, personal character, extracurricular activities, and references are sometimes taken into account, for which the Universities of Calgary, Windsor and McGill&#x27;s holistic law school admissions are well known, but the LSAT remains far more determinative of admission than comparable standardized tests for other disciplines, such as the MCAT or GMAT. Quebec law schools, including the dual-curriculum, bilingual McGill University Faculty of Law, do not require applicants to write the LSAT, although any scores are generally taken into account; nor do the French-language common-law programs at the Université de Moncton École de droit and University of Ottawa Faculty of Law.

All of Canada&#x27;s law schools are affiliated with public universities, and are thus public institutions. This practice has been held to have helped reduce disparities in the quality of students and instruction as between the schools. Since there is a limited number of positions in each law school&#x27;s annual admissions, entry to all Canadian law schools is intensely competitive: most law schools receive far more applicants than they can accommodate. Most schools focus on their respective regions, and many graduates remain in the region in which the school is located, though the relatively uniform quality of the law schools affords greater geographic mobility to graduates.

After completing the Juris Doctor (J.D.), a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), or a Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.), students must article for about a year (in Quebec, the six-month &quot;stage&quot; is the equivalent to articling); this can be a challenge for those with lower grades, as there are often a shortage of articling positions, and completion of articles is required to be able to practice law in Canada. Articling involves on-the-job training, at a lower introductory salary, under the supervision of a lawyer licensed by the Provincial Bar who has been practising for a minimum of 5 years. An alternative to articling, usually for the most competitive students, is to complete a Judicial Clerkship with a provincial or federal court under the direction of a judge. After ten to sixteen months of articling or clerking and call to the bar, lawyers are free to practice in their own right: many are hired by the same lawyer or firm for which they articled, while some choose to begin independent practices or accept positions with different employers. Others may leave the private practice of law to work in government or industry as a lawyer or in a law-related position. Former Judicial Law Clerks are typically not hired by the court after their clerkship.

<doc id="221046" wikidata="Q1993203" url="?curid=221046" title="Lake Union">
<text>Lake Union () is a freshwater lake located entirely within the city limits of Seattle, Washington, United States. It is a major part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, which carries fresh water from the much larger Lake Washington on the east to Puget Sound on the west. The easternmost point of the lake is the Ship Canal Bridge, which carries Interstate 5 over the eastern arm of the lake and separates Lake Union from Portage Bay. Lake Union is the namesake of the neighborhoods located on three of its shores: Eastlake, Westlake and South Lake Union. Notable destinations on the lake include Lake Union Park, the Museum of History &amp; Industry (MOHAI), and the Center for Wooden Boats on the southern shore and Gas Works Park on the northern shore.
The Aurora Bridge (officially the George Washington Memorial Bridge) carries State Route 99 over the western arm of Lake Union. The Aurora Bridge is so named because it carries Aurora Ave N down the western side of the lake. Lake Union&#x27;s westernmost point can be considered the Fremont Cut, which is located just west of the Aurora Bridge and is spanned by the Fremont Bridge. The Fremont Bridge carries Fremont Ave N between the neighborhoods of Fremont and Queen Anne and separates Lake Union from the rest of the Lake Washington Ship Canal to the west.

==Description==
Lake Union is a natural lake in Seattle that lies north of the city&#x27;s central business district. It is fully surrounded by urban neighborhoods and highways. Lake Union is the smaller of the two major lakes in Seattle, the other being Lake Washington.

Part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal system, water flows into the lake from Lake Washington through the Montlake Cut, and out via the Fremont Cut on its way to Puget Sound. Before the construction of the canal, Lake Union emptied into Salmon Bay via a creek which followed roughly the same course as the Fremont Cut does today.

Because of the connection via the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks to the salt water of Puget Sound, the water is brackish to a certain extent, which increases in the summer as the inflow rate from Lake Washington decreases and the locks open more frequently for pleasure craft.

==History==

A glacial lake, its basin was dug 12,000 years ago by the Vashon glacier, which also created Lake Washington and Seattle&#x27;s Green, Bitter, and Haller Lakes.

===Name===
In Lushootseed, the lake is known as , meaning &quot;small lake.&quot; It is the diminutive form of the name of Lake Washington, .

In Chinook Jargon, the trade language primarily used in the 19th century, it is called (&quot;small water&quot;). 

Lake Union received its present name from Thomas Mercer, who in 1854 correctly predicted that canals would someday join Lake Washington to Puget Sound in a &quot;union of waters.&quot;

===Pre-development===

Lake Union was formed by the recession of the Vashon Glacier approximately 14,000 years before present.

==Geography==

Several Seattle neighborhoods take their name from the lake: Eastlake, Westlake, Northlake, and South Lake Union; and three major streets are named in relation to it: Westlake Avenue, which runs along its western shore from Downtown to the Fremont Bridge; Eastlake Avenue, which runs along its eastern shore from Cascade to the University District, and Northlake Way, which runs along its northern shore from the University District past Gas Works Park to the edge of Fremont.


==Uses==

Boeing began production on Lake Union in 1916, there had a hangar assembled the company&#x27;s first product B &amp; W Seaplane. Shipyards, wharves, and sawmills have also dotted the shore.

===Floating homes===

Floating homes line the east and west sides of Lake Union. In &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, the character played by Tom Hanks lived on one of these homes.

==Recreation==
Lake Union&#x27;s proximity to and scenic views of the central Seattle and University District skylines make it a popular recreational spot. Seaplane operated by Kenmore Air and Seattle Seaplanes land and take off from the lake throughout the day. Pleasure boats from Lake Washington pass through on their way to Puget Sound. The Center for Wooden Boats holds a yearly wooden boat festival, while the annual Seattle Boat Show at the end of January demonstrates seacraft for sale on actual waters, in addition to its displays in the concourse of Lumen Field. The world-famous Duck Dodge sailboat races are run on Lake Union each Tuesday during the summer. Rowers in sweep and sculling boats use the lake year-round. Paddleboarding and kayaking are also popular on this lake.

===Parks===
Gas Works Park is the largest park on Lake Union and the most popular for Seattleites and visitors. It is the venue for summer concerts and Seattle&#x27;s major Fourth of July fireworks show. Other parks ring the lake, clockwise around the compass from Gas Works which is nearly due north: North Passage Point Park, South Passage Point Park, Fairview Park, Terry Pettus Park, and South Lake Union Park.

===Competitive rowing===
Lake Union is home to several rowing centers and teams, including Holy Names Academy Crew, Lake Union Crew, Lake Washington Rowing Club and Pocock Rowing Center, all members of USRowing. Also rowing out of bodies of water attached to Lake Union are the Seattle Rowing Center and the Conibear Shellhouse, serving the Washington Huskies.

==Transportation==

===Seaplane base===

Lake Union is home to two seaplane bases: Kenmore Air Harbor Seaplane Base , and Seattle Seaplanes , located one nautical mile (1.85 km) north of the central business district of Seattle.

<text>Flow measurement is the quantification of bulk fluid movement. Flow can be measured using devices called flowmeters in various ways. The common types of flowmeters with industrial applications are listed below:
* Obstruction type (differential pressure or variable area) 
* Inferential (turbine type)
* Electromagnetic
* Positive-displacement flowmeters, which accumulate a fixed volume of fluid and then count the number of times the volume is filled to measure flow. 
* Fluid dynamic (vortex shedding)
* Anemometer
* Ultrasonic flow meter
* Mass flow meter (Coriolis force).

Flow measurement methods other than positive-displacement flowmeters rely on forces produced by the flowing stream as it overcomes a known constriction, to indirectly calculate flow. Flow may be measured by measuring the velocity of fluid over a known area. For very large flows, tracer methods may be used to deduce the flow rate from the change in concentration of a dye or radioisotope.

==Kinds and units of measurement==
Both gas and liquid flow can be measured in physical quantities of kind volumetric flow rate or mass flow rates, with respective SI units such as cubic meters per second or kilograms per second, respectively. These measurements are related by the material&#x27;s density. The density of a liquid is almost independent of conditions. This is not the case for gases, the densities of which depend greatly upon pressure, temperature and to a lesser extent, composition.

When gases or liquids are transferred for their energy content, as in the sale of natural gas, the flow rate may also be expressed in terms of energy flow, such as gigajoule per hour or BTU per day. The energy flow rate is the volumetric flow rate multiplied by the energy content per unit volume or mass flow rate multiplied by the energy content per unit mass. Energy flow rate is usually derived from mass or volumetric flow rate by the use of a flow computer.

In engineering contexts, the volumetric flow rate is usually given the symbol formula_1, and the mass flow rate, the symbol formula_2.

For a fluid having density formula_3, mass and volumetric flow rates may be related by formula_4.

===Gas===
Gases are compressible and change volume when placed under pressure, are heated or are cooled. A volume of gas under one set of pressure and temperature conditions is not equivalent to the same gas under different conditions. References will be made to &quot;actual&quot; flow rate through a meter and &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;base&quot; flow rate through a meter with units such as &quot;acm/h&quot; (actual cubic meters per hour), &quot;sm3/sec&quot; (standard cubic meters per second), &quot;kscm/h&quot; (thousand standard cubic meters per hour), &quot;LFM&quot; (linear feet per minute), or &quot;MMSCFD&quot; (million standard cubic feet per day).

Gas &quot;mass&quot; flow rate can be directly measured, independent of pressure and temperature effects, with ultrasonic flow meters, thermal mass flowmeters, Coriolis mass flowmeters, or mass flow controllers.

===Liquid===
For liquids, various units are used depending upon the application and industry, but might include gallons (U.S. or imperial) per minute, liters per second, liters per m2 per hour, bushels per minute or, when describing river flows, cumecs (cubic meters per second) or acre-feet per day. In oceanography a common unit to measure volume transport (volume of water transported by a current for example) is a sverdrup (Sv) equivalent to 106 m3/s.

==Primary flow element==
A primary flow element is a device inserted into the flowing fluid that produces a physical property that can be accurately related to flow. For example, an orifice plate produces a pressure drop that is a function of the square of the volume rate of flow through the orifice. A vortex meter primary flow element produces a series of oscillations of pressure. Generally, the physical property generated by the primary flow element is more convenient to measure than the flow itself. The properties of the primary flow element, and the fidelity of the practical installation to the assumptions made in calibration, are critical factors in the accuracy of the flow measurement.

==Mechanical flowmeters==
A positive displacement meter may be compared to a bucket and a stopwatch. The stopwatch is started when the flow starts and stopped when the bucket reaches its limit. The volume divided by the time gives the flow rate. For continuous measurements, we need a system of continually filling and emptying buckets to divide the flow without letting it out of the pipe. These continuously forming and collapsing volumetric displacements may take the form of pistons reciprocating in cylinders, gear teeth mating against the internal wall of a meter or through a progressive cavity created by rotating oval gears or a helical screw.

===Piston meter/rotary piston===
Because they are used for domestic water measurement, piston meters, also known as rotary piston or semi-positive displacement meters, are the most common flow measurement devices in the UK and are used for almost all meter sizes up to and including 40 mm ( in). The piston meter operates on the principle of a piston rotating within a chamber of known volume. For each rotation, an amount of water passes through the piston chamber. Through a gear mechanism and, sometimes, a magnetic drive, a needle dial and odometer type display are advanced.

=== Oval gear meter ===

An oval gear meter is a positive displacement meter that uses two or more oblong gears configured to rotate at right angles to one another, forming a T shape. Such a meter has two sides, which can be called A and B. No fluid passes through the center of the meter, where the teeth of the two gears always mesh. On one side of the meter (A), the teeth of the gears close off the fluid flow because the elongated gear on side A is protruding into the measurement chamber, while on the other side of the meter (B), a cavity holds a fixed volume of fluid in a measurement chamber. As the fluid pushes the gears, it rotates them, allowing the fluid in the measurement chamber on side B to be released into the outlet port. Meanwhile, fluid entering the inlet port will be driven into the measurement chamber of side A, which is now open. The teeth on side B will now close off the fluid from entering side B. This cycle continues as the gears rotate and fluid is metered through alternating measurement chambers. Permanent magnets in the rotating gears can transmit a signal to an electric reed switch or current transducer for flow measurement. Though claims for high performance are made, they are generally not as precise as the sliding vane design.

===Gear meter===
Gear meters differ from oval gear meters in that the measurement chambers are made up of the gaps between the teeth of the gears. These openings divide up the fluid stream and as the gears rotate away from the inlet port, the meter&#x27;s inner wall closes off the chamber to hold the fixed amount of fluid. The outlet port is located in the area where the gears are coming back together. The fluid is forced out of the meter as the gear teeth mesh and reduce the available pockets to nearly zero volume.

====Helical gear====
Helical gear flowmeters get their name from the shape of their gears or rotors. These rotors resemble the shape of a helix, which is a spiral-shaped structure. As the fluid flows through the meter, it enters the compartments in the rotors, causing the rotors to rotate. The length of the rotor is sufficient that the inlet and outlet are always separated from each other thus blocking a free flow of liquid. The mating helical rotors create a progressive cavity which opens to admit fluid, seals itself off and then opens up to the downstream side to release the fluid. This happens in a continuous fashion and the flowrate is calculated from the speed of rotation.

====Nutating disk meter====
This is the most commonly used measurement system for measuring water supply in houses. The fluid, most commonly water, enters in one side of the meter and strikes the nutating disk, which is eccentrically mounted. The disk must then &quot;wobble&quot; or nutate about the vertical axis, since the bottom and the top of the disk remain in contact with the mounting chamber. A partition separates the inlet and outlet chambers. As the disk nutates, it gives direct indication of the volume of the liquid that has passed through the meter as volumetric flow is indicated by a gearing and register arrangement, which is connected to the disk. It is reliable for flow measurements within 1 percent.

===Turbine flowmeter===
The turbine flowmeter (better described as an axial turbine) translates the mechanical action of the turbine rotating in the liquid flow around an axis into a user-readable rate of flow (gpm, lpm, etc.). The turbine tends to have all the flow traveling around it.

The turbine wheel is set in the path of a fluid stream. The flowing fluid impinges on the turbine blades, imparting a force to the blade surface and setting the rotor in motion. When a steady rotation speed has been reached, the speed is proportional to fluid velocity.

Turbine flowmeters are used for the measurement of natural gas and liquid flow. Turbine meters are less accurate than displacement and jet meters at low flow rates, but the measuring element does not occupy or severely restrict the entire path of flow. The flow direction is generally straight through the meter, allowing for higher flow rates and less pressure loss than displacement-type meters. They are the meter of choice for large commercial users, fire protection, and as master meters for the water distribution system. Strainers are generally required to be installed in front of the meter to protect the measuring element from gravel or other debris that could enter the water distribution system. Turbine meters are generally available for 4 to 30 cm (–12 in) or higher pipe sizes. Turbine meter bodies are commonly made of stainless steel, bronze, cast Iron, or ductile iron. Internal turbine elements can be plastic or non-corrosive metal alloys. They are accurate in normal working conditions but are greatly affected by the flow profile and fluid conditions.

Turbine flowmeters are commonly best suited for low viscosity, as large particulate can damage the rotor. When choosing a meter for an application that requires particulate flowing through the pipe, it is best to use a meter without moving parts such as a Magnetic flowmeters.

Fire meters are a specialized type of turbine meter with approvals for the high flow rates required in fire protection systems. They are often approved by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or Factory Mutual (FM) or similar authorities for use in fire protection. Portable turbine meters may be temporarily installed to measure water used from a fire hydrant. The meters are normally made of aluminum to be lightweight, and are usually 7.5 cm (3 in) capacity. Water utilities often require them for measurement of water used in construction, pool filling, or where a permanent meter is not yet installed.

===Woltman meter===
The Woltman meter (invented by Reinhard Woltman in the 19th century) comprises a rotor with helical blades inserted axially in the flow, much like a ducted fan; it can be considered a type of turbine flowmeter. They are commonly referred to as helix meters, and are popular at larger sizes.

===Single jet meter===
A single jet meter consists of a simple impeller with radial vanes, impinged upon by a single jet. They are increasing in popularity in the UK at larger sizes and are commonplace in the EU.

===Paddle wheel meter===
Paddle wheel flowmeters (also known as Pelton wheel sensors) consist of three primary components: the paddle wheel sensor, the pipe fitting and the display/controller. The paddle wheel sensor consists of a freely rotating wheel/impeller with embedded magnets which are perpendicular to the flow and will rotate when inserted in the flowing medium. As the magnets in the blades spin past the sensor, the paddle wheel meter generates a frequency and voltage signal which is proportional to the flow rate. The faster the flow the higher the frequency and the voltage output.

The paddle wheel meter is designed to be inserted into a pipe fitting, either &#x27;in-line&#x27; or insertion style. Similarly to turbine meters, the paddle wheel meter requires a minimum run of straight pipe before and after the sensor.

Flow displays and controllers are used to receive the signal from the paddle wheel meter and convert it into actual flow rate or total flow values.

===Multiple jet meter===
A multiple jet or multijet meter is a velocity type meter which has an impeller which rotates horizontally on a vertical shaft. The impeller element is in a housing in which multiple inlet ports direct the fluid flow at the impeller causing it to rotate in a specific direction in proportion to the flow velocity. This meter works mechanically much like a single jet meter except that the ports direct the flow at the impeller equally from several points around the circumference of the element, not just one point; this minimizes uneven wear on the impeller and its shaft. Thus, these types of meters are recommended to be installed horizontally with its roller index pointing skywards.

===Pelton wheel===
The Pelton wheel turbine (better described as a radial turbine) translates the mechanical action of the Pelton wheel rotating in the liquid flow around an axis into a user-readable rate of flow (gpm, lpm, etc.). The Pelton wheel tends to have all the flow traveling around it with the inlet flow focused on the blades by a jet. The original Pelton wheels were used for the generation of power and consisted of a radial flow turbine with &quot;reaction cups&quot; which not only move with the force of the water on the face but return the flow in opposite direction using this change of fluid direction to further increase the efficiency of the turbine.

===Current meter===

Flow through a large penstock such as used at a hydroelectric power plant can be measured by averaging the flow velocity over the entire area. Propeller-type current meters (similar to the purely mechanical Ekman current meter, but now with electronic data acquisition) can be traversed over the area of the penstock and velocities averaged to calculate total flow. This may be on the order of hundreds of cubic meters per second. The flow must be kept steady during the traverse of the current meters. Methods for testing hydroelectric turbines are given in IEC standard 41. Such flow measurements are often commercially important when testing the efficiency of large turbines.

==Pressure-based meters==
There are several types of flowmeter that rely on Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. The pressure is measured either by using laminar plates, an orifice, a nozzle, or a Venturi tube to create an artificial constriction and then measure the pressure loss of fluids as they pass that constriction, or by measuring static and stagnation pressures to derive the dynamic pressure.

===Venturi meter===
A Venturi meter constricts the flow in some fashion, and pressure sensors measure the differential pressure before and within the constriction. This method is widely used to measure flow rate in the transmission of gas through pipelines, and has been used since Roman Empire times. The coefficient of discharge of Venturi meter ranges from 0.93 to 0.97. The first large-scale Venturi meters to measure liquid flows were developed by Clemens Herschel, who used them to measure small and large flows of water and wastewater beginning at the very end of the 19th century.

===Orifice plate===
An orifice plate is a plate with a hole through it, placed perpendicular to the flow; it constricts the flow, and measuring the pressure differential across the constriction gives the flow rate. It is basically a crude form of Venturi meter, but with higher energy losses. There are three type of orifice: concentric, eccentric, and segmental.

===Dall tube===
The Dall tube is a shortened version of a Venturi meter, with a lower pressure drop than an orifice plate. As with these flowmeters the flow rate in a Dall tube is determined by measuring the pressure drop caused by restriction in the conduit. The pressure differential is typically measured using diaphragm pressure transducers with digital readout. Since these meters have significantly lower permanent pressure losses than orifice meters, Dall tubes are widely used for measuring the flow rate of large pipeworks. Differential pressure produced by a Dall tube is higher than Venturi tube and nozzle, all of them having same throat diameters.

===Pitot tube===

A pitot tube is used to measure fluid flow velocity. The tube is pointed into the flow and the difference between the stagnation pressure at the tip of the probe and the static pressure at its side is measured, yielding the dynamic pressure from which the fluid velocity is calculated using Bernoulli&#x27;s equation. A volumetric rate of flow may be determined by measuring the velocity at different points in the flow and generating the velocity profile.

===Averaging pitot tube===

Averaging pitot tubes (also called impact probes) extend the theory of pitot tube to more than one dimension. A typical averaging pitot tube consists of three or more holes (depending on the type of probe) on the measuring tip arranged in a specific pattern. More holes allow the instrument to measure the direction of the flow velocity in addition to its magnitude (after appropriate calibration). Three holes arranged in a line allow the pressure probes to measure the velocity vector in two dimensions. Introduction of more holes, e.g. five holes arranged in a &quot;plus&quot; formation, allow measurement of the three-dimensional velocity vector.

===Cone meters===

Cone meters are a newer differential pressure metering device first launched in 1985 by McCrometer in Hemet, CA. The cone meter is a generic yet robust differential pressure (DP) meter that has shown to be resistant to effects of asymmetric and swirling flow. While working with the same basic principles as Venturi and orifice type DP meters, cone meters don&#x27;t require the same upstream and downstream piping. The cone acts as a conditioning device as well as a differential pressure producer. Upstream requirements are between 0–5 diameters compared to up to 44 diameters for an orifice plate or 22 diameters for a Venturi. Because cone meters are generally of welded construction, it is recommended they are always calibrated prior to service. Inevitably heat effects of welding cause distortions and other effects that prevent tabular data on discharge coefficients with respect to line size, beta ratio and operating Reynolds numbers from being collected and published. Calibrated cone meters have an uncertainty up to ±0.5%. Un-calibrated cone meters have an uncertainty of ±5.0%

=== Linear resistance meters ===
Linear resistance meters, also called laminar flowmeters, measure very low flows at which the measured differential pressure is linearly proportional to the flow and to the fluid viscosity. Such flow is called viscous drag flow or laminar flow, as opposed to the turbulent flow measured by orifice plates, Venturis and other meters mentioned in this section, and is characterized by Reynolds numbers below 2000. The primary flow element may consist of a single long capillary tube, a bundle of such tubes, or a long porous plug; such low flows create small pressure differentials but longer flow elements create higher, more easily measured differentials. These flowmeters are particularly sensitive to temperature changes affecting the fluid viscosity and the diameter of the flow element, as can be seen in the governing Hagen–Poiseuille equation.

==Variable-area flowmeters==

A &quot;variable area meter&quot; measures fluid flow by allowing the cross sectional area of the device to vary in response to the flow, causing some measurable effect that indicates the rate.
A rotameter is an example of a variable area meter, where a weighted &quot;float&quot; rises in a tapered tube as the flow rate increases; the float stops rising when area between float and tube is large enough that the weight of the float is balanced by the drag of fluid flow. A kind of rotameter used for medical gases is the Thorpe tube flowmeter. Floats are made in many different shapes, with spheres and spherical ellipses being the most common. Some are designed to spin visibly in the fluid stream to aid the user in determining whether the float is stuck or not. Rotameters are available for a wide range of liquids but are most commonly used with water or air. They can be made to reliably measure flow down to 1% accuracy.

Another type is a variable area orifice, where a spring-loaded tapered plunger is deflected by flow through an orifice. The displacement can be related to the flow rate.

==Optical flowmeters==
Optical flowmeters use light to determine flow rate. Small particles which accompany natural and industrial gases pass through two laser beams focused a short distance apart in the flow path in a pipe by illuminating optics. Laser light is scattered when a particle crosses the first beam. The detecting optics collects scattered light on a photodetector, which then generates a pulse signal. As the same particle crosses the second beam, the detecting optics collect scattered light on a second photodetector, which converts the incoming light into a second electrical pulse. By measuring the time interval between these pulses, the gas velocity is calculated as formula_5 where formula_6 is the distance between the laser beams and formula_7 is the time interval.

Laser-based optical flowmeters measure the actual speed of particles, a property which is not dependent on thermal conductivity of gases, variations in gas flow or composition of gases. The operating principle enables optical laser technology to deliver highly accurate flow data, even in challenging environments which may include high temperature, low flow rates, high pressure, high humidity, pipe vibration and acoustic noise.

Optical flowmeters are very stable with no moving parts and deliver a highly repeatable measurement over the life of the product. Because distance between the two laser sheets does not change, optical flowmeters do not require periodic calibration after their initial commissioning. Optical flowmeters require only one installation point, instead of the two installation points typically required by other types of meters. A single installation point is simpler, requires less maintenance and is less prone to errors.

Commercially available optical flowmeters are capable of measuring flow from 0.1 m/s to faster than 100 m/s (1000:1 turn down ratio) and have been demonstrated to be effective for the measurement of flare gases from oil wells and refineries, a contributor to atmospheric pollution.

==Open-channel flow measurement==
Open channel flow describes cases where flowing liquid has a top surface open to the air; the cross-section of the flow is only determined by the shape of the channel on the lower side, and is variable depending on the depth of liquid in the channel. Techniques appropriate for a fixed cross-section of flow in a pipe are not useful in open channels. Measuring flow in waterways is an important open-channel flow application; such installations are known as stream gauges.

===Level to flow===
The level of the water is measured at a designated point behind weir or in flume using various secondary devices (bubblers, ultrasonic, float, and differential pressure are common methods). This depth is converted to a flow rate according to a theoretical formula of the form formula_8 where formula_1 is the flow rate, formula_10 is a constant, formula_11 is the water level, and formula_12 is an exponent which varies with the device used; or it is converted according to empirically derived level/flow data points (a &quot;flow curve&quot;). The flow rate can then be integrated over time into volumetric flow. Level to flow devices are commonly used to measure the flow of surface waters (springs, streams, and rivers), industrial discharges, and sewage. Of these, weirs are used on flow streams with low solids (typically surface waters), while flumes are used on flows containing low or high solids contents.

===Area/velocity===
The cross-sectional area of the flow is calculated from a depth measurement and the average velocity of the flow is measured directly (Doppler and propeller methods are common). Velocity times the cross-sectional area yields a flow rate which can be integrated into volumetric flow. There are two types of area velocity flowmeter: (1) wetted; and (2) non-contact. Wetted area velocity sensors have to be typically mounted on the bottom of a channel or river and use Doppler to measure the velocity of the entrained particles. With depth and a programmed cross-section this can then provide discharge flow measurement. Non-contact devices that use laser or radar are mounted above the channel and measure the velocity from above and then use ultrasound to measure the depth of the water from above. Radar devices can only measure surface velocities, whereas laser-based devices can measure velocities sub-surface.

===Dye testing===
A known amount of dye (or salt) per unit time is added to a flow stream. After complete mixing, the concentration is measured. The dilution rate equals the flow rate.

===Acoustic Doppler velocimetry===
Acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) is designed to record instantaneous velocity components at a single point with a relatively high frequency. Measurements are performed by measuring the velocity of particles in a remote sampling volume based upon the Doppler shift effect.

==Thermal mass flowmeters==

Thermal mass flowmeters generally use combinations of heated elements and temperature sensors to measure the difference between static and flowing heat transfer to a fluid and infer its flow with a knowledge of the fluid&#x27;s specific heat and density. The fluid temperature is also measured and compensated for. If the density and specific heat characteristics of the fluid are constant, the meter can provide a direct mass flow readout, and does not need any additional pressure temperature compensation over their specified range.

Technological progress has allowed the manufacture of thermal mass flowmeters on a microscopic scale as MEMS sensors; these flow devices can be used to measure flow rates in the range of nanoliters or microliters per minute.

Thermal mass flowmeter (also called thermal dispersion or thermal displacement flowmeter) technology is used for compressed air, nitrogen, helium, argon, oxygen, and natural gas. In fact, most gases can be measured as long as they are fairly clean and non-corrosive. For more aggressive gases, the meter may be made out of special alloys (e.g. Hastelloy), and pre-drying the gas also helps to minimize corrosion.

Today, thermal mass flowmeters are used to measure the flow of gases in a growing range of applications, such as chemical reactions or thermal transfer applications that are difficult for other flowmetering technologies. Some other typical applications of flow sensors can be found in the medical field like, for example, CPAP devices, anesthesia equipment or respiratory devices. This is because thermal mass flowmeters monitor variations in one or more of the thermal characteristics (temperature, thermal conductivity, and/or specific heat) of gaseous media to define the mass flow rate.

===The MAF sensor===
In many late model automobiles, a Mass Airflow (MAF) sensor is used to accurately determine the mass flow rate of intake air used in the internal combustion engine. Many such mass flow sensors use a heated element and a downstream temperature sensor to indicate the air flowrate. Other sensors use a spring-loaded vane. In either case, the vehicle&#x27;s electronic control unit interprets the sensor signals as a real-time indication of an engine&#x27;s fuel requirement.

==Vortex flowmeters==
Another method of flow measurement involves placing a bluff body (called a shedder bar) in the path of the fluid. As the fluid passes this bar, disturbances in the flow called vortices are created. The vortices trail behind the cylinder, alternatively from each side of the bluff body. This vortex trail is called the Von Kármán vortex street after von Kármán&#x27;s 1912 mathematical description of the phenomenon. The frequency at which these vortices alternate sides is essentially proportional to the flow rate of the fluid. Inside, atop, or downstream of the shedder bar is a sensor for measuring the frequency of the vortex shedding. This sensor is often a piezoelectric crystal, which produces a small, but measurable, voltage pulse every time a vortex is created. Since the frequency of such a voltage pulse is also proportional to the fluid velocity, a volumetric flow rate is calculated using the cross-sectional area of the flowmeter. The frequency is measured and the flow rate is calculated by the flowmeter electronics using the equation formula_13
where formula_14 is the frequency of the vortices, formula_15 the characteristic length of the bluff body, formula_16 is the velocity of the flow over the bluff body, and formula_17 is the Strouhal number, which is essentially a constant for a given body shape within its operating limits.

==Sonar flow measurement==

Sonar flowmeters are non-intrusive clamp-on devices that measure flow in pipes conveying slurries, corrosive fluids, multiphase fluids and flows where insertion type flowmeters are not desired. Sonar flowmeters have been widely adopted in mining, metals processing, and upstream oil and gas industries where traditional technologies have certain limitations due to their tolerance to various flow regimes and turn down ratios.

Sonar flowmeters have the capacity of measuring the velocity of liquids or gases non-intrusively within the pipe and then leverage this velocity measurement into a flow rate by using the cross-sectional area of the pipe and the line pressure and temperature. The principle behind this flow measurement is the use of underwater acoustics.

In underwater acoustics, to locate an object underwater, sonar uses two knowns:

* The speed of sound propagation through the array (i.e., the speed of sound through seawater)
* The spacing between the sensors in the sensor array

and then calculates the unknown:

* The location (or angle) of the object.

Likewise, sonar flow measurement uses the same techniques and algorithms employed in underwater acoustics, but applies them to flow measurement of oil and gas wells and flow lines.

To measure flow velocity, sonar flowmeters use two knowns:

* The location (or angle) of the object, which is 0 degrees since the flow is moving along the pipe, which is aligned with the sensor array
* The spacing between the sensors in the sensor array

and then calculates the unknown:
* The speed of propagation through the array (i.e. the flow velocity of the medium in the pipe).

==Electromagnetic, ultrasonic and Coriolis flowmeters==
Modern innovations in the measurement of flow rate incorporate electronic devices that can correct for varying pressure and temperature (i.e. density) conditions, non-linearities, and for the characteristics of the fluid.

===Magnetic flowmeters===
Magnetic flowmeters, often called &quot;mag meter&quot;s or &quot;electromag&quot;s, use a magnetic field applied to the metering tube, which results in a potential difference proportional to the flow velocity perpendicular to the flux lines. The potential difference is sensed by electrodes aligned perpendicular to the flow and the applied magnetic field. The physical principle at work is Faraday&#x27;s law of electromagnetic induction. The magnetic flowmeter requires a conducting fluid and a nonconducting pipe liner. The electrodes must not corrode in contact with the process fluid; some magnetic flowmeters have auxiliary transducers installed to clean the electrodes in place. The applied magnetic field is pulsed, which allows the flowmeter to cancel out the effect of stray voltage in the piping system.

===Non-contact electromagnetic flowmeters===
A Lorentz force velocimetry system is called Lorentz force flowmeter (LFF). An LFF measures the integrated or bulk Lorentz force resulting from the interaction between a liquid metal in motion and an applied magnetic field. In this case, the characteristic length of the magnetic field is of the same order of magnitude as the dimensions of the channel. It must be addressed that in the case where localized magnetic fields are used, it is possible to perform local velocity measurements and thus the term Lorentz force velocimeter is used.

===Ultrasonic flowmeters (Doppler, transit time)===
There are two main types of ultrasonic flowmeters: Doppler and transit time. While they both utilize ultrasound to make measurements and can be non-invasive (measure flow from outside the tube, pipe or vessel, also called clamp-on device), they measure flow by very different methods.

Ultrasonic transit time flowmeters measure the difference of the transit time of ultrasonic pulses propagating in and against the direction of flow. This time difference is a measure for the average velocity of the fluid along the path of the ultrasonic beam. By using the absolute transit times both the averaged fluid velocity and the speed of sound can be calculated. Using the two transit times formula_18 and formula_19 and the distance between receiving and transmitting transducers formula_15 and the inclination angle formula_21 one can write the equations:
formula_22
and
formula_23
where formula_24 is the average velocity of the fluid along the sound path and formula_25 is the speed of sound.

With wide-beam illumination transit time ultrasound can also be used to measure volume flow independent of the cross-sectional area of the vessel or tube.

Ultrasonic Doppler flowmeters measure the Doppler shift resulting from reflecting an ultrasonic beam off the particulates in flowing fluid. The frequency of the transmitted beam is affected by the movement of the particles; this frequency shift can be used to calculate the fluid velocity. For the Doppler principle to work, there must be a high enough density of sonically reflective materials such as solid particles or air bubbles suspended in the fluid. This is in direct contrast to an ultrasonic transit time flowmeter, where bubbles and solid particles reduce the accuracy of the measurement. Due to the dependency on these particles, there are limited applications for Doppler flowmeters. This technology is also known as acoustic Doppler velocimetry.

One advantage of ultrasonic flowmeters is that they can effectively measure the flow rates for a wide variety of fluids, as long as the speed of sound through that fluid is known. For example, ultrasonic flowmeters are used for the measurement of such diverse fluids as liquid natural gas (LNG) and blood. One can also calculate the expected speed of sound for a given fluid; this can be compared to the speed of sound empirically measured by an ultrasonic flowmeter for the purposes of monitoring the quality of the flowmeter&#x27;s measurements. A drop in quality (change in the measured speed of sound) is an indication that the meter needs servicing.

===Coriolis flowmeters===
Using the Coriolis effect that causes a laterally vibrating tube to distort, a direct measurement of mass flow can be obtained in a coriolis flowmeter. Furthermore, a direct measure of the density of the fluid is obtained. Coriolis measurement can be very accurate irrespective of the type of gas or liquid that is measured; the same measurement tube can be used for hydrogen gas and bitumen without recalibration.

Coriolis flowmeters can be used for the measurement of natural gas flow.

==Laser Doppler flow measurement==
A beam of laser light impinging on a moving particle will be partially scattered with a change in wavelength proportional to the particle&#x27;s speed (the Doppler effect). A laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV), also called a laser Doppler anemometer (LDA), focuses a laser beam into a small volume in a flowing fluid containing small particles (naturally occurring or induced). The particles scatter the light with a Doppler shift. Analysis of this shifted wavelength can be used to directly, and with great precision, determine the speed of the particle and thus a close approximation of the fluid velocity.

A number of different techniques and device configurations are available for determining the Doppler shift. All use a photodetector (typically an avalanche photodiode) to convert the light into an electrical waveform for analysis. In most devices, the original laser light is divided into two beams. In one general LDV class, the two beams are made to intersect at their focal points where they interfere and generate a set of straight fringes. The sensor is then aligned to the flow such that the fringes are perpendicular to the flow direction. As particles pass through the fringes, the Doppler-shifted light is collected into the photodetector. In another general LDV class, one beam is used as a reference and the other is Doppler-scattered. Both beams are then collected onto the photodetector where optical heterodyne detection is used to extract the Doppler signal.

==Calibration==
Even though ideally the flowmeter should be unaffected by its environment, in practice this is unlikely to be the case. Often measurement errors originate from incorrect installation or other environment dependent factors. In situ methods are used when flowmeter is calibrated in the correct flow conditions. The result of a flowmeter calibration will result in two related statistics: a performance indicator metric and a flow rate metric.

===Transit time method===
For pipe flows a so-called transit time method is applied where a radiotracer is injected as a pulse into the measured flow. The transit time is defined with the help of radiation detectors placed on the outside of the pipe. The volume flow is obtained by multiplying the measured average fluid flow velocity by the inner pipe cross-section. This reference flow value is compared with the simultaneous flow value given by the flow measurement to be calibrated.

The procedure is standardised (ISO 2975/VII for liquids and BS 5857-2.4 for gases). The best accredited measurement uncertainty for liquids and gases is 0.5%.

===Tracer dilution method===
The radiotracer dilution method is used to calibrate open channel flow measurements. A solution with a known tracer concentration is injected at a constant known velocity into the channel flow. Downstream the tracer solution is thoroughly mixed over the flow cross-section, a continuous sample is taken and its tracer concentration in relation to that of the injected solution is determined. The flow reference value is determined by using the tracer balance condition between the injected tracer flow and the diluting flow.
The procedure is standardised (ISO 9555-1 and ISO 9555-2 for liquid flow in open channels). The best accredited measurement uncertainty is 1%.

<text>The John Marek Independent Party (JMIP) was a political party in North Wales which eventually evolved into Forward Wales.

== Formation ==
The JMIP was formed in March 2003 by John Marek, after he was deselected by his local constituency Labour Party (CLP) as the official candidate for the Wrexham constituency in the 2003 National Assembly for Wales election. Marek alleged this was over his criticisms of its &quot;perceived rightward march&quot;, and that he was the victim of a &quot;smear campaign&quot;. Others have alleged this to not be the case, with Jeffrey Cuthbert, then AM for Caerphilly saying that &quot;John Marek did not leave the Labour Party on any point of principle - he wanted to be the party candidate right up to the last minute. It was only when it was clear that the party members in Wrexham wanted someone else that John decided to stand as an independent. John&#x27;s conversion to far-left politics appears to be very recent.&quot;

The JMIP stood for the May 2003 elections to the National Assembly for Wales on a left-wing platform that included public ownership of the railways and greater powers for the Assembly. The media portrayed the JMIP as a real threat to Labour in North-East Wales.

== Electoral Results ==
The party stood in the constituencies of Wrexham and Clwyd South. The party also had a list in the North Wales region. Their candidates were:

*John Marek (Wrexham, former Labour MP/AM)
*Colin Jones (Second on the North Wales List, Anti-War Activist)
*Marc Jones (Clwyd South, BBC Wales Director and Producer)

On 1 May 2003, Marek won Wrexham with 6,539 votes or 37.7% of the vote. Elsewhere they got 2,210 or 11.8% in Clwyd South and 11,008 or 6.3% on the North Wales list. It was the only minor party to retain its deposit in the regional lists and its constituency result compared favourably with other left-wing candidates.

== Re-launch ==
During its existence the JMIP forged strong links with the Scottish Socialist Party, and Tommy Sheridan spoke at its Summer Gathering in August 2003. On 8 November 2003, the JMIP held a conference and re-launched itself as Forward Wales.

<text>Legal education is the education of individuals in the principles, practices, and theory of law. It may be undertaken for several reasons, including to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for admission to legal practice in a particular jurisdiction, to provide a greater breadth of knowledge to those working in other professions such as politics or business, to provide current lawyers with advanced training or greater specialisation, or to update lawyers on recent developments in the law.

Legal education can take the form of a variety of programs, including: 
* Primary degrees in law, which may be studied at either undergraduate or graduate level depending on the country.
* Advanced academic degrees in law, such as masters and doctoral degrees. 
* Practice or training courses, which prospective lawyers are required to pass in some countries before they may enter practice. 
* Applied or specialised law accreditation, which are less formal than degree programs but which provide specialised certification in particular areas. 
* Continuing legal education, which do not lead to a qualification but provide practicing lawyers with updates on recent legal developments.

== History ==
Early Western legal education emerged in Republican Rome. Initially those desiring to be advocates would train in schools of rhetoric. Around the third century BCE Tiberius Coruncanius began teaching law as a separate discipline. His public legal instruction had the effect of creating a class of legally skilled non-priests (&quot;jurisprudentes&quot;), a sort of consultancy. After Coruncanius&#x27; death, instruction gradually became more formal, with the introduction of books on law beyond the then scant official Roman legal texts. It is possible that Coruncanius allowed members of the public and students to attend consultations with citizens in which he provided legal advice. These consultations were probably held outside the College of Pontiffs, and thus accessible to all those interested.

Canon and ecclesiastical law were studied in universities in medieval Europe. However, institutions providing education in the domestic law of each country emerged later in the eighteenth century.

In England, legal education emerged in the late thirteenth century through apprenticeships. The Inns of Court controlled admission to practice and also provided some legal training. English universities had taught Roman and canon law for some time, but formal degrees focused on the native common law did not emerge until the 1800s.

William Blackstone was in favor of a general academic foundation prior to the study of common law:

For sciences are of a sociable disposition, and flourish best in the neighbourhood of each other: nor is there any branch of learning but may be helped and improved by assistances drawn from other arts.

Students of common law would, according to Blackstone, benefit from the study of classical writers, logc, mathematics, philosophical ideas of art and nature, so that &quot;if he has impressed on his mind the sound maxims of the law of nature, the best and most authentic foundation of human laws&quot; and the reduction of such maxims to &quot;a practical system in the laws of imperial Rome&quot;, then the student would enter the study if law &quot;with incredible advantage and reputation&quot;. Blackstone also recommends that students take &quot;a year or two&#x27;s farther leisure&quot; at the conclusion of their formal legal study to establish a &quot;solid scientifical method&quot; as the foundation of his future practice, so that he would afterwards &quot;proceed with the greatest ease, and will unfold the most intricate points with an intuitive rapidity and clearness&quot;.

== Forms ==

=== Primary degrees in law ===

In many countries, including most of those in the Commonwealth of Nations, the principal law degree is an undergraduate degree, usually known as a Bachelor of Laws (LLB). Graduates of such a program are eligible to become lawyers by passing the country&#x27;s equivalent of a bar exam. In these countries, graduate law programs are advanced degrees which allow for more in-depth study or specialisation.

In the United States and Canada, the primary law degree is a graduate degree known as the Juris Doctor (JD). Students may pursue such a degree only after completing an undergraduate degree, usually a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The undergraduate degree can be in any field, though most American lawyers hold bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the humanities and social sciences. American law schools are usually an autonomous entity within a larger university.

Primary degrees in law are offered by law schools, known in some countries as faculties of law. Law schools may have varying degrees of autonomy within a particular university or, in some countries, can be entirely independent of any other post-secondary educational institution.

=== Advanced degrees in law ===
Higher degrees allow for more advanced academic study. These include the Masters of Law (LLM) by coursework or research, and doctoral degrees such as the PhD or SJD.

Practitioners may undertake a Masters of Law by coursework to obtain greater specialisation in an area in which they practice. In many common law countries, a higher degree in law is common and expected for legal academics. In addition, incorporating practical skills is beneficial for practitioners seeking higher degrees to better prepare them in their respective legal area of practice.

In contrast, higher degrees in law are uncommon in the United States, even within the academy.

=== Practice or training courses ===
In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Canada and some states of Australia, the final stages of vocational legal education required to qualify to practice law are carried out outside the university system. The requirements for qualification as a barrister or as a solicitor are covered in those articles.

=== Applied law programs or specialist accreditation ===
Legal education providers in some countries offer courses which lead to a certificate or accreditation in applied legal practice or a particular specialisation.

=== Continuing legal education ===
Continuing legal education (also known as continuing professional development) programs are informal seminars or short courses which provide legal practitioners with an opportunity to update their knowledge and skills throughout their legal career. In some jurisdictions, it is mandatory to undertake a certain amount of continuing legal education each year.

==By country==
===Australia===
In Australia most universities offer law as an undergraduate-entry course (LLB, 4 years), or combined degree course (e.g., BSc/LLB, BCom/LLB, BA/LLB, BE/LLB, 5–6 years). Some of these also offer a three-year postgraduate Juris Doctor (JD) program. Bond University in Queensland runs three full semesters each year, teaching from mid-January to late December. This enables the Bond University Law Faculty to offer the LLB in the usual 8 semesters, but only 2 years. They also offer a JD in two years. The University of Technology, Sydney will from 2010 offer a 2-year accelerated JD program.

In 2008, the University of Melbourne introduced the Melbourne Model, whereby Law is only available as a graduate degree, with students having to have completed a three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree (usually an Arts degree) before being eligible. Students in combined degree programs would spend the first 3 years completing their first bachelor&#x27;s degree together with some preliminary law subjects, and then spend the last 2–3 years completing the law degree (JD). Alternatively, one can finish any bachelor&#x27;s degree, and providing their academic results are high, apply for graduate-entry into a 3-year LLB program. Australian Law Schools include those at the University of New England, Australian Catholic University, Australian National University, La Trobe University, Flinders University, Bond University, Macquarie, Monash, Deakin, UNSW, University of Tasmania, Adelaide, Victoria University, Sydney, Melbourne, Queensland University of Technology, the University of Queensland, the University of Western Australia and the University of Canberra.

=== Canada ===
The professional law degree in Canada is the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) / Juris Doctor (J.D.) for common law jurisdictions, and the Bachelor of Laws, Licentiate of Law or Bachelor of Civil Law (LL.B./LL.L./B.C.L.) for Quebec, a civil law jurisdiction. Quebec civil law degrees (and the transsystemic B.C.L../J.D. [previously called B.C.L./LL.B.] program at McGill University) are undergraduate-entry—students can be admitted directly after Quebec&#x27;s pre-university college program ().

Admittance to an LL.B. (also called J.D.) program in common law requires at least two years of undergraduate education, although a completed undergraduate degree is usually required. In practice, the vast majority of those who are admitted have already earned at least an undergraduate (bachelor&#x27;s) degree. The change in academic nomenclature re-designating the common law degree as a J.D. rather than an LL.B., currently completed or under consideration at a number of Canadian schools, has not affected the level of instruction—it is the same degree.

=== China ===


=== Germany ===
In Germany, law degrees historically did not exist and were unnecessary for legal practice. Now, those who wish to enter the legal profession must study in universities, for which the standard curriculum length is 4 and 1/2 years. Some law schools have also begun to award the Diplom-Jurist degree. German students enter into law school after high school (&quot;Gymnasium&quot;) graduation.

After their studies, candidates complete the First State Examination. In the First State Exam, 30% of the exam is on a specialized area of law, chosen by the examinee, which is organized and carried out by the university. In practice, the more important part is the 70% of obligatory areas of law examined by the &quot;Justizprüfungsamt&quot;, a body of the state administration of justice. Failure rates of the 1st State Examination can be up to 30%. The written part concerns the analysis of legal issues.

After passing the 1st State Examination, candidates undertake a two-year legal traineeship (&quot;Referendariat&quot;), organized by the Federal States. After the legal traineeship, candidates must take the 2nd State Examination, with failure rates far lower than in the 1st State Examination. The written exam consists of drafting judgments, contract and other legal documents; there is also an oral exam. After passing the 2nd State Exam, the trainee may become a lawyer.

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong law can be studied as a four-year undergraduate degree Bachelor of Laws (LLB), a two-year postgraduate degree (Juris Doctor), or the Common Professional Examination conversion course for non-law graduates. One must then pass the one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Laws (PCLL) currently offered at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Chinese University of Hong Kong and City University of Hong Kong, before starting vocational training: a year&#x27;s pupillage for barristers or a two-year training contract for solicitors.

The move to a four-year LLB was recent and, in the case of HKU, was aimed at shifting some of the more theoretical aspects of the HKU PCLL into the LLB, leaving more room for practical instruction.

===India===

The Bar Council of India prescribes and supervises standard of legal education in India. Law degrees in India are granted and conferred in terms of the Advocates Act, 1961, which is a law passed by the Parliament both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession. Various regional universities or specialised national law universities offer Law graduate degrees through various law schools.

In India law can be studied, as LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law), a three-year graduate degree after completion of Bachelor&#x27;s degree. Alternatively after standard 12 one can join an integrated five-year law course which provides option to avail B.A. LL.B. or B.B.A. LLB. or B.Sc. LL.B. In India applied legal education for specific branches of law is also offered such as, Business law, Human resource and Labour laws, Property laws, Family laws, Human rights &amp; Legal awareness, Taxation law and many more.

=== Italy and France ===
Law in Italy and France is studied in a jurisprudence school which is an entity within a larger university. Legal education can be started immediately after obtained a Diploma. Italian and French law schools are affiliated with public universities, and are thus public institutions. As a consequence, law schools are required to admit anyone holding the baccalaureate. However, the failure rate is extremely high (up to 70%) during the first two years of the &quot;licenza in diritto&quot;. There are no vast disparities in the quality of Southern European law schools. Many schools focus on their respective city and region.

The law school program is divided following the European standards for university studies (Bologna process):
* first a license of law program (&quot;Licence de droit&quot;): three-year period
* Then a Master of law program (&quot;Master de droit&quot;): two-year period
* Ph.D. in law (&quot;Doctorat en droit&quot;): three-year period (often more).

The first year of the master program (M1) is specialized: public law, private law, business law, European and international law, etc.

The second year of the master of law program (M2) can be work-oriented or research oriented (the students write a substantial thesis and can apply to doctoral programs, e.g., a PhD in law).

The second year is competitive (entry is based on the student&#x27;s grades and overall score and on extracurricular activities) and generally more specialized (IP law, contract law, civil liberties, etc.).

Students must pass a specific examination to enter bar school (CRFPA, école du barreau). They must successfully finish the first year of a Master of law (M1 or maitrise de droit) to be able to attend.

If they succeed, then after 18 months (school, practical aspects, ethics and internship) they then take the CAPA exam and diploma(Certificat d&#x27;Aptitude à la Profession d&#x27;Avocat). Successful students also take the Oath in order to practice law.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese Ministry of Justice opened the University of Tokyo Faculty of Law in 1877 (changed to Imperial University in 1886). To matriculate to the University of Tokyo, students had to finish ten to fifteen years of compulsory education; acceptance was therefore available to only a small elite. The law program produced politically dependable graduates to fill fast-track administrative positions in government, also known as high civil servants (koto bunkan), and to serve as judges and prosecutors.

Private law schools opened around 1880. These lacked the government funding given to the University of Tokyo, so the quality of education there lagged behind. Students only had to pass an examination to matriculate to private law schools, so many of them had not completed middle school. The private law schools produced a large portion of private attorneys because their graduates were often ineligible to apply for government positions.

The Imperial University Faculty of Law was given supervisory authority over many private law schools in 1887; by the 1920s, it promulgated a legal curriculum comprising six basic codes: Constitutional Law, Civil Law, Commercial Law, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, and Criminal Procedure. The same basic structure survived in Japanese legal education to the end of the twentieth century.

Prior to the implementation of the &quot;law school system&quot; in 2004, the legal education system was driven more by examinations than by formal schooling. The passage rate for the bar exam was historically around three percent, and nearly all those who sat for the exam took it several times. A number of specialized &quot;cram schools&quot; trained prospective lawyers for the exam, and these schools remain prevalent today. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers were required to train for 16 months at the Legal Research and Training Institute of the Supreme Court of Japan. The training period has traditionally been devoted to litigation practice and virtually no training is given for other aspects of legal practice, e.g., contract drafting, legal research. During this period, the most &quot;capable trainees&quot; are &quot;selected out&quot; to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2004, the Japanese Diet passed a law allowing for the creation of graduate level law school that offer a J.D., or Hōmu Hakushi (法務博士). The 2006 bar examination was first in Japanese history to require a law school degree as a prerequisite. In the past, although there has been no educational requirement, most of those who passed the examination had earned undergraduate degrees from &quot;elite&quot; Japanese universities such as the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University or Hitotsubashi University. With this new law school system came a new bar exam, with a 40–50% passage rate which is capped by a numerical quota. Applicants are now limited to taking the exam three times in a five-year period. Despite the much higher bar passage rate with the new exam, due to the quotas, approximately half of Japanese law school graduates will never be admitted to practice. The new system also reduced the apprenticeship period at the Legal Research and Training Institute to one year.

A number of other law-related professions exist in Japan, such as patent agents (&quot;benrishi&quot;), tax accountants (&quot;zeirishi&quot;), scriveners, etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination. Attorneys (&quot;bengoshi&quot;), being qualified to practice any law, can automatically be qualified as patent agents and tax accountants with no additional examination, but not vice versa.

=== Korea ===
Legal education in Korea is driven by examination. The profession of barristers, is highly regulated, and the pass rate for the bar exam is around five percent. Prospective attorneys who do pass the exam usually take it two or three times before passing it, and a number of specialized &quot;private educational institutes&quot; exist for prospective lawyers. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers undergo a two-year training period at the Judicial Research and Training Institute of the Supreme Court of Korea. During this period, the most capable trainees are &quot;selected out&quot; to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2007, the Korean government passed a law allowing for the creation of three-year law schools (&quot;법학전문대학원&quot;). According to the new law, the old system of selecting lawyers by examination will be phased out by 2013 and the U.S.-style law schools will be the sole route to become a lawyer.

In February 2008, the Ministry of Education of Korea selected 25 universities to open law schools. The total enrollment for all law schools is capped at 2,000, which is a source of contention between the powerful Korea Bar Association, and citizen groups and school administrators. There is an uproar among the schools which failed to get the government&#x27;s approval and even among the schools that did get the approval, there is dissatisfaction due to an extremely low enrollment number. Several law schools are permitted to enroll 40 students per year, which is far below the financially sustainable number. Beginning in 2012, passage of the Lawyer Admission Test (which is distinct from the old bar exam) will be required for qualification to practice.

A number of other legal professions exist in Korea, such as patent attorneys (&quot;변리사&quot;), tax attorneys (&quot;세무사&quot;), solicitors(&quot;법무사&quot;), etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination.

=== Malaysia ===

As a Commonwealth country, the Malaysian legal education system is rooted from the United Kingdom. Legal qualifications offered by the local law faculties require students to have a pre-university qualification such as the Malaysian Higher School Certificate, A-Level, International Baccalaureate, Foundation Course or a Diploma. Generally, the law degree programmes in Malaysia consist of civil law subjects, but there are institutions such as The National University of Malaysia, International Islamic University Malaysia and Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin that include Sharia or Islamic law courses as requirements for admission and graduation.

Malaysian law graduates from universities in the UK, Australia or New Zealand are allowed to practice law in Malaysia. However, they are required to obtain a Certificate of Legal Practice in Laws of Malaysia.

===New Zealand===

The Council of Legal Education was established by section 2 of the New Zealand University Amendment Act 1930 (amending and deemed part of the New Zealand University Act 1908). There is a New Zealand Law Students Association, which has published a journal called &quot;Wagon Mound&quot;, and holds an annual national mooting competition. There is an Auckland University Law Students Society, which publishes the Auckland University Law Review, is a member of International Law Students Association, and which held the Students&#x27; Conference on Law Reform in 1965. There is a Wellington Law Students Society, an Otago Law Students Society, and a University of Canterbury Law Students Society. The original Canterbury Law Students Society was established in 1875.

=== Philippines ===

Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas.
Legal education in the Philippines is regulated and supervised by the Legal Education Board, a statutorily created independent Body chaired by a retired member of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals. Its first chairman is Justice Hilarion Aquino. Sitting as members of the Board are a representative of the law professors, a representative of the law deans and a representative of the Commission on Higher Education. The membership of a student representative has been subject to continuing debate and resistance on the part of law schools.
Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the Philippine Bar Examinations, administered by the Supreme Court during the month of September every year.

In order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete either of the two professional degrees: The Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) program or the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines. The degrees Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Legal Studies are available in only a handful of Philippine universities and colleges, among these San Beda College Graduate School of Law, the University of Santo Tomas and Ateneo de Manila University. The Doctor of Civil Law degree (DCL) is offered only by the University of Santo Tomas and the Doctor of Juridical Science (JSD) degree is offered by the San Beda College Graduate School of Law. Graduate programs in law are also regulated by the Legal Education Board.

Legal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 4 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)
* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
Law degree – jurist (often compared to an LL.M., but in fact equivalent to the degree of Specialist specific to the Soviet educational system) is awarded in Russia and Ukraine after 5 years of study at a university. Jurist degree may also be awarded in a shorter period of time if a law student has already completed Bachelor or Specialist degree in another field of studies or has previously earned a basic law degree (comparable to Paralegal, an associate degree in U.S.) from a specialized law college. Bachelor jurist degree (equivalent to Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.)) may be earned concurrently with another bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degree in some universities (comparable to a double-major). Note that this fused, one-degree (Specialist) educational scheme has coexisted with the two-degree (bachelor&#x27;s – master&#x27;s) scheme since Russia and Ukraine launched their higher education reforms to bring the domestic educational systems in closer compliance with the Bologna accords. See also academic degree. The latest educational reforms created new system where a four-year law program is offered at the universities for earning bachelor&#x27;s degree, and a five-year law program is offered for master&#x27;s degree. The degree of Specialist is no longer awarded and is renamed into master&#x27;s degree.

=== Serbia ===
To become a lawyer in Serbia, students must graduate from an accredited faculty of law. First-level studies last four years (eight semesters), after which it is possible to enroll in Master&#x27;s degree and PhD studies programmes. To become a student of the faculty of law, a candidate must pass the admission test. The practical training for students is organized at courts of law, and local and international moot court competitions. A lawyer must pass the national bar examination to become an attorney, a judge, or a prosecutor. In order to take the bar exam, it is only necessary to complete the 4 year studies programme and have a certain amount of work experience ( i.e. as a paralegal), but most attorneys have also attained the master&#x27;s degree in law before passing the bar exam.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the LL.B. is the universal legal qualification for admission and enrollment as an Advocate or Attorney. Since 1998, LL.B. programmes may be entered directly at the undergraduate level; at the same time, the LLB. continues to be offered postgraduate and may then be accelerated dependent on the bachelor&#x27;s degree. The programme lasts between two and four years correspondingly (compare Australia, above). See .

Although not formally required for specialised practice, further training, e.g. in tax, is usually via postgraduate diplomas or focused, coursework-based LL.M. programmes. Research degrees are the LL.M. and LL.D., or PhD depending on university. The Master&#x27;s dissertation reflects an ability to conduct independent research, whereas the Doctoral thesis will, in addition, constitute an original contribution to the field of law in question. A doctorate, generally, is required for positions in legal academia. See ; .

Historically, the B.Proc. and B.Juris were the legal degrees offered at the undergraduate level. The four-year BProc qualified one to practise as an attorney, or become a prosecutor or magistrate in the lower courts, but did not allow for admission as an advocate. The three-year B.Juris was the basic requirement for prosecutors and magistrates in the lower courts, but on its own, did not qualify one to practise as an attorney. Both offered admission to the LLB.

For admission as an attorney, one serves &quot;articles&quot; as a candidate attorney with a practising attorney for two years, and then writes a &quot;board exam&quot; set by the relevant provincial Law Society. See Attorneys in South Africa. The length of articles may be reduced by attending a practical legal training course or performing community service.
Attorneys may additionally qualify as Notaries and Conveyancers, via the Conveyancing and Notarial Practice Examinations; those with technical or scientific training may further qualify as patent attorneys.

The requirements to enter private practice as advocates (Junior Counsel) are to become members of a Bar Association by undergoing a period of training (pupilage) for one year with a practicing Advocate, and to sit an admission examination. On the recommendation of the Bar Councils, an advocate &quot;of proven experience and skill&quot; with at least ten years experience, may be appointed by the President of South Africa as a Senior Counsel (SC; also referred to as a &quot;silk&quot;). See Advocates in South Africa.

The Act regulating admission to practise law (&quot;The Qualifications of Legal Practitioners Amendment Act of 1997&quot;) is being revised.

=== South American countries ===

The law of South America is one of the most unified in the world. All countries can be said to follow civil law systems, although recent developments in the law of Brazil suggest a move towards the &quot;stare decisis&quot; doctrine.

=== Sri Lanka ===

In order to practice law in Sri Lanka, a lawyer must be &#x27;admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. To be admitted to the bar a law student must complete law exams held by the Sri Lanka Law College and undergo a six-month period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer. There are two routes taken by students:

# Those who have gained a law degree, an LL.B. (which is 3–4 years long in Sri Lankan State Universities of University of Colombo, University of Jaffna, Open University of Sri Lanka and University of Peradeniya) are given direct entry to undertake law exams at the Sri Lanka Law College.
# Those who don&#x27;t hold a law degree, could gain entrance to the Sri Lanka Law College via a competitive entrance exam to study law and prepare for the law exams.

Both groups of students must undergo a period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer who has at least 8 years of practicing experience. To become a judge one must be admitted as an Attorney-at-Law.

=== United Kingdom ===

In England and Wales, law can be studied as an undergraduate degree or in a Graduate Diploma in Law where students complete the Common Professional Examination. After obtaining the degree which is necessary to complete certain vocational courses and to serve a period of on the job training before one is able to qualify to practice as a barrister, legal executive, or solicitor. Bar Professional Training Course is regarded as one of the hardest degrees and presently it is the most expensive law-related degree.

===United States===


The education of lawyers in the United States is generally undertaken through a law school program, although in some states (such as California and Virginia) applicants who have not attended law school may qualify to take the bar exam.

Legal education in the United States normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 3 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a state&#x27;s bar exam)
* Legal practice

In the United States, in most cases, the degree awarded by American law schools is the Doctor of Jurisprudence or Juris Doctor (J.D.), a Doctoral degree, the pursuit of which students undertake only after having completed an undergraduate degree in some other field (usually a bachelor&#x27;s degree). The law school program is considered to be a professional school program and upon graduation you receive the distinct title of Doctor (although most states strictly regulate the ability of attorneys to style themselves &quot;doctor&quot;).

Research degrees that are awarded include the Master of Laws (LL.M.), Doctor of Juridical Science degrees (J.S.D. or S.J.D.) and Doctor of Comparative Law (D.C.L.), are post-undergraduate and research and academic-based level degrees. In the U.S. the Legum Doctor (LL.D.) is only awarded as an honorary degree.

A number of law students apply for an optional judicial clerkship (less than 10% end up in such position), to be taken after law school and before legal practice. Clerkships usually last one year with appellate courts, but trial level courts (including federal district court) are increasingly moving towards two-year clerkships.

Once a student has graduated from law school, the student is expected to pursue admission to the bar in order to practice. Requirements for membership in the bar vary across the United States. In almost every state, the only way to be admitted to the bar is to pass a (usually multi-day) written examination. Once admitted, most States require attorneys to must meet certain Continuing Legal Education (CLE) requirements.

Academic degrees for non-lawyers are available at the baccalaureate and master&#x27;s level. A common baccalaureate level degree is a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies (B.S.). Academic master&#x27;s degrees in legal studies are available, such as the Master of Studies (M.S.), and the Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.). Such a degree is not required to enter a J.D. program.

Foreign lawyers seeking to practice in the U.S., who do not have a J.D., often seek to obtain a Master of Laws (LL.M.) (or other degrees similar to the LL.M., such as the Juris Master (J.M.), Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.) and Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.)).

<text>Futura International Airways was an airline with its head office in the &quot;Zona Facturación&quot; on the property of Palma de Mallorca Airport in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. It operated scheduled services and charter flights for tour operators and other airlines, in Europe, as well as wet lease and ad hoc charters. Its main base was Palma de Mallorca Airport. After failing to re-finance itself the company ceased trading on the 8 September 2008, leaving many passengers stranded in and around Spain.

There was also an intrastate airline operating in California in the U.S. in 1962 flying as Futura Airlines with Lockheed Constellation propliners serving Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, Fresno, Bakersfield and Lake Tahoe.

== History ==
The airline was established in 1989 by Aer Lingus, Belton Air and Banco Santander, starting operations on 17 February 1990 with a flight from Palma de Mallorca to Manchester. During the 1990s, the airline expanded to cover the whole of Europe, including the Canary Islands in the South and Scandinavia and Iceland in the North, with charter flights, ad hoc charters, third party short-medium-long term operations (wet-lease) and ACMI. Under the leadership of CEO Roman Pané , it used to operate its own scheduled flights and ad hoc flights on behalf of various tour operators and airlines in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. Futura operated from five permanent bases: Palma de Mallorca, Tenerife, Málaga, Gran Canaria and Dublin; as well as various other seasonal bases throughout the year. (Source: ).

The airline was later owned by Corpfin Capital (65%), Aer Lingus (20%) and management and employees (15%). On 16 October 2007, Corpfin Capital and Aer Lingus sold their stakes, during the process of a secondary buyout instigated by the present management team, making way for the participation of the investment fund Hutton Collins, so that the resulting shareholdings were as follows: the Futura Group (management and employees) had 53.5% and Hutton Collins owned 46.5%. The airline had 1,211 employees (at May 2008). It wholly owned cargo subsidiary Flyant (officially Servicios Aéreos Integrales S.A.) and Dublin-based Irish charter airline Futura Gael.

In 2008, a few months prior to its demise, in order to reduce the cost base structure, Futura relaunched Flyant as a new passenger carrier with a class-1 AOC, while continuing freighter operations as well under the Flyant name as well. Flyant (passenger carrier) took over some Futura operations, wet leasing a Boeing 737-300 and a 737-400 to Air Algerie, both aircraft and crew were based in Algiers. Futura also set up and operated a successful turn-key airline setting up and management consultancy and offered its services and on the ground aircraft maintenance services as well to several air carriers across continents, one example being Aerolínea Principal in Chile.

The airline abruptly ceased operations at 00:00 on September 8, 2008, due to a lack of cash (with debts of around €50 million). Its AOC was revoked by the Spanish Aviation Authority two weeks later after the airline was unable to show a viability plan. Since then, its grounded fleet was gradually returned to lessors.

Flyant, which also ceased operations initially alongside parent Futura, later continued in the cargo business, having been sold for the symbolic amount of one Euro, to New Iberital, a Catalan logistics group, which later renamed it Saicus Air. Flyant/Saicus Air continued operating a reduced fleet of a single Boeing 737-300, although eventually this other airline also ceased operations on 14 December 2008. : An attempt was made to restart passenger operations under Saicus Air using MD-83 aircraft however, that also was unsuccessful.

<doc id="221081" wikidata="Q1552740" url="?curid=221081" title="Hand (unit)">
<text>The hand is a non-SI unit of measurement of length standardized to . It is used to measure the height of horses in many English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It was originally based on the breadth of a human hand. The adoption of the international inch in 1959 allowed for a standardized imperial form and a metric conversion. It may be abbreviated to &quot;h&quot; or &quot;hh&quot;. Although measurements between whole hands are usually expressed in what appears to be decimal format, the subdivision of the hand is not decimal but is in base 4, so subdivisions after the radix point are in quarters of a hand, which are inches. Thus, 62 inches is fifteen and a half hands, or 15.2 hh (normally said as &quot;fifteen-two&quot;, or occasionally in full as &quot;fifteen hands two inches&quot;).

==Terminology==
&quot;Hands&quot; may be abbreviated to &quot;h&quot;, or &quot;hh&quot;. The &quot;hh&quot; form is sometimes interpreted as standing for &quot;hands high&quot;. When spoken aloud, hands are stated by numbers, 15.0 is &quot;fifteen hands&quot;, 15.2 is alternately &quot;fifteen-two&quot; or &quot;fifteen hands, two inches&quot;, and so on.

To convert inches to hands, the number in inches is divided by four, then the remainder is added after the radix point. Thus, a horse that measures 60 inches is 15 hands high (15 × 4 = 60) and a horse halfway between 15 and 16 hands is 15.2 hands, or 62 inches tall (15 × 4 + 2 = 62) Because the subdivision of a hand is a base 4 system, a horse 64 inches high is 16.0 hands high, not 15.4. A designation of &quot;15.5 hands&quot; is not halfway between 15 and 16 hands, but rather reads 15 hands and five inches, an impossibility in a base 4 radix numbering system, where a hand is four inches.

==History==
===Ancient Egypt===
The hand, sometimes also called a handbreadth or handsbreadth, is an anthropic unit, originally based on the breadth of a male human hand, either with or without the thumb, or on the height of a clenched fist.

On surviving Ancient Egyptian cubit-rods, the royal cubit is divided into seven palms of four digits or fingers each. Five digits are equal to a hand, with thumb; and six to a closed fist. The royal cubit measured approximately 525 mm, so the width of the ancient Egyptian hand was about 94 mm.
=== Biblical use ===
In Biblical exegesis the hand measurement, as for example in the Vision of the Temple, Authorized Version , is usually taken to be palm or handbreadth, and in modern translations may be rendered as &quot;handbreadth&quot; or &quot;three inches&quot;.

===United Kingdom===

The hand is a traditional unit in the UK. It was standardised at four inches by a statute of King Henry VIII, the Horses Act 1540 (32 Hen. 8. c. 13), but some confusion between the various types of hand measurement, and particularly between the hand and the handsbreadth, appears to have persisted. Phillips&#x27;s dictionary of 1706 gives four inches for the length of the handful or hand, and three inches for the handsbreadth; Mortimer gives the same, three inches for the Hand&#x27;s-breadth, and four for the &quot;Handful, or simply, Hand&quot;, but adds &quot;The hand among horse-dealers, &amp;c. is four-fingers&#x27; breadth, being the fist clenched, whereby the height of a horse is measured&quot;, thus equating &quot;hand&quot; with both the palm and the fist. Similarly, Wright&#x27;s 1831 translation of Buffon mentions &quot;A hand breadth (palmus), the breadth of the four fingers of the hand, or three inches&quot;, but the &quot;Encyclopædia Perthensis&quot; of 1816 gives under Palm (4): &quot;A hand, or measure of lengths comprising three inches&quot;.

==Use in measuring horses==

Today the hand is used to measure the height of horses, ponies, and other equines. It is used in the US and also in some other nations that use the metric system, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland and the UK. In other parts of the world, including continental Europe and in FEI-regulated international competition, horses are measured in metric units, usually metres or centimetres. In South Africa, measurements may be given in both hands and centimetres, while in Australia, the equestrian regulations stipulate that both measurements are to be given.

In those countries where hands are the usual unit for measuring horse height, inches rather than hands are commonly used in the measurement of smaller equines including miniature horses/ponies, miniature mules, donkeys, and Shetland ponies.

A horse is measured from the ground to the top of the highest non-variable point of the skeleton, the withers. For official measurement, the spinous process of the fifth thoracic vertebra may be identified by palpation, and marked if necessary. Some varieties of Miniature horses are measured at the base of the last true hairs of the mane rather than at the withers.

For international competition regulated by the Fédération Équestre Internationale (FEI) and for USEF competition in the US, a horse can be measured with shoes on or off. In the United Kingdom, official measurement of horses is overseen by the Joint Measurement Board (JMB). For JMB purposes, the shoes must be removed and the hooves correctly prepared for shoeing prior to measurement.

<doc id="221090" wikidata="Q5405002" url="?curid=221090" title="Etti Plesch">
<text>Etti Plesch, born Countess Maria Anna Paula Ferdinandine von Wurmbrand-Stuppach (3 February 1914 – 29 April 2003), was an Austro-Hungarian countess, huntress, racehorse owner, and socialite. Plesch lost two of her six husbands to the same woman, Louise de Vilmorin, a French literary figure, and owned two winners of The Derby, Psidium in 1961 and Henbit in 1980.

== Early life ==
Born as Countess Maria Anna Paula Ferdinandine von Wurmbrand-Stuppach in Vienna, Austria, of Greco-Austrian heritage. &quot;Etti&quot;, as she was known, was putatively the elder daughter of Count Ferdinand von Wurmbrand-Stuppach (1879–1933) and his wife, May Baltazzi (1885–1981), a cousin of Baroness Mary Vetsera, mistress of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. 

It is presumed that countess&#x27;s biological father was Count Josef Gizycki (1867–1926), the son of Count Michał Tadeusz Giżycki (d. 1898) and his wife, Countess Ludmilla Zamoyska (1829-1889). 

Etti&#x27;s mother said that Count Gizycki&#x27;s main interest in life was &quot;the pleasuring of women in a physical way... He was amoral and cynical, but he was a marvelous lover.&quot; Gizycki was famed in the early 1900s because of his stormy marriage to American newspaper heiress Cissy Patterson.

Etti von Wurmbrand-Stuppach spent her childhood in her family&#x27;s castle of Napajedla and was raised in Vienna and in Moravia, with travels to other sites throughout Europe. From the age of 10 until she was 17, she was treated for tuberculosis at the Waltzaner Sanatorium in Davos, the setting for Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;.

== Thoroughbred racing ==
With her last husband, Dr. Plesch, who shared Etti&#x27;s passion for Thoroughbred horse racing, for which she had been influenced by her maternal grandfather , who won the 1876 edition of the Epsom Derby with Kisber. Her husband and she began racing Thoroughbreds in 1954, and won major races such as the 1959 Coronation Cup with Nagami and that year&#x27;s Irish Oaks with Discorea. Their 1961 Epsom Derby winner Psidium was bred by Etti Plesch and raced by the couple. Following her husband&#x27;s death in 1974, she continued to race horses, and in 1970 won France&#x27;s most prestigious race with Sassafras. In 1980, Etti Plesch became the only female owner to ever win the Epsom Derby twice when her horse Henbit won England&#x27;s most prestigious race.

Among her other notable horses, Etti Plesch owned and raced Miswaki, a Group One winner in France as well as a stakes race winner in the United States, hat became an important sire of 97 stakes race winners and was the Leading broodmare sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1999 and 2001.

== Personal life==
At the age of 17, she fell in love with Count Wladimir &quot;Wladschi&quot; Mittrovsky von Mitrowitz (1901-1976), but was forbidden to marry him because he had a blood disease. She journeyed to New York and met up with her mother&#x27;s distant relative, Prince Chlodwig Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst, Prince of Ratibor and Corvey (1897-1968). While there, she met American railway heir Clendenin J. Ryan Jr. (1905–1957), grandson of Thomas Fortune Ryan, who proposed to her on their third date. Etti married him on 20 February 1935 in Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was best man. The marriage only lasted three months; they divorced in 1935 and she returned to Europe with &quot;a settlement of only $35,000.&quot; The marriage was later annulled in 1944.

===Second marriage===
After she returned to Europe, she met another distant relative, Hungarian Count Paul Pálffy ab Erdöd (1890–1968) and became the fourth of his eight eventual wives in late 1935. They lived in Slovakia. Their life was taken up with tiger hunts in India; they both became good shots, killing stags, elephants, and antelopes. They attended the World Exposition of Shooting at Berlin, hosted by Hermann Göring. Shortly afterwards, Pálffy became smitten with siren-like writer Louise de Vilmorin in Paris, divorced Etti in December 1937, and married Louise.

===Third marriage===
On the rebound, Etti married Count Tamás Esterházy de Galántha (1901–1964), descendant of the junior comital branch of a great princely family, on 5 March 1938, and went to live in his Devecser castle, in Hungary. The two were also related, both descending from Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein. Together, they hunted, traveled, and had one daughter:

* Marie-Anna Berta Felicie Johanna Ghislaine Theodora Huberta Georgina Helene Genoveva &quot;Bunny&quot; Esterházy de Galántha (1938–2021), who married the Hon. Dominic Elliot (b. 1931), a younger son of the 5th Earl of Minto, in 1962; they divorced 1972.

In 1942, she journeyed abroad alone, and her husband became involved with Vilmorin, the same woman who had married her second husband Count Pálffy of Erdöd. Count Esterházy divorced Etti in 1944 and ran away with Vilmorin, although the two never married.

===Fourth marriage===
Etti&#x27;s next husband was another distant relative, Austrian Count Sigismund Berchtold zu Ungarschütz (1900–1979), son of Count Leopold Berchtold, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who advised the Emperor to declare war on the Serbs, starting World War I, and his wife, Countess Nandine Károlyi de Nagy-Károly (1868-1955). They wed in 1944 and divorced in 1949.

===Fifth marriage===
The fifth was Chicago millionaire William Deering Davis, who had been briefly married to silent film star Louise Brooks, in the 1930s; Plesch&#x27;s marriage, at age 34, to Davis, aged 52, lasted from 1949 until their divorce in 1951.

===Sixth marriage===
In 1954, Etti married her last husband, Dr Árpád Plesch (1889–1974), a wealthy Hungarian lawyer, international financier, and collector of rare botanical books and pornographic esoterica. She met Plesch through her friends Gloria Guinness and Thomas &quot;Loel&quot; Guinness in Paris. The Plesches lived on the Avenue Foch in Paris, and at the Villa Leonina at Beaulieu-sur-Mer in the south of France, where he had a famous botanical garden.

After her husband&#x27;s death in 1974, she took up partying, and writing her memoirs, which were almost completed at the time of her death. They were edited by Hugo Vickers and published posthumously in 2007 as &quot;Horses and Husbands&quot;. She died 29 April 2003 in Monte Carlo.

===Descendants===
Through her daughter Bunny, she was a grandmother to two boys, Alexander Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound (1963–1985), who died unmarried, and Esmond Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound (b. 1965).
