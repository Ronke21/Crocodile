<text>Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells, are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. They are a kind of large granular lymphocytes (LGL), and belong to the rapidly expanding family of known innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and represent 5–20% of all circulating lymphocytes in humans. The role of NK cells is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells in the vertebrate adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, stressed cells, tumor cells, and other intracellular pathogens based on signals from several activating and inhibitory receptors. Most immune cells detect the antigen presented on major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) on infected cell surfaces, but NK cells can recognize and kill stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction. They were named &quot;natural killers&quot; because of the notion that they do not require activation to kill cells that are missing &quot;self&quot; markers of MHC class I. This role is especially important because harmful cells that are missing MHC I markers cannot be detected and destroyed by other immune cells, such as T lymphocyte cells.

NK cells can be identified by the presence of CD56 and the absence of CD3 (CD56+, CD3−). NK cells differentiate from CD127+ common innate lymphoid progenitor, which is downstream of the common lymphoid progenitor from which B and T lymphocytes are also derived. NK cells are known to differentiate and mature in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, and thymus, where they then enter into the circulation. NK cells differ from natural killer T cells (NKTs) phenotypically, by origin and by respective effector functions; often, NKT cell activity promotes NK cell activity by secreting interferon gamma. In contrast to NKT cells, NK cells do not express T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) or pan T marker CD3 or surface immunoglobulins (Ig) B cell receptors, but they usually express the surface markers CD16 (FcγRIII) and CD57 in humans, NK1.1 or NK1.2 in C57BL/6 mice. The NKp46 cell surface marker constitutes, at the moment, another NK cell marker of preference being expressed in both humans, several strains of mice (including BALB/c mice) and in three common monkey species.

Outside of innate immunity, both activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors play important functional roles in self tolerance and the sustaining of NK cell activity. NK cells also play a role in the adaptive immune response: numerous experiments have demonstrated their ability to readily adjust to the immediate environment and formulate antigen-specific immunological memory, fundamental for responding to secondary infections with the same antigen. The role of NK cells in both the innate and adaptive immune responses is becoming increasingly important in research using NK cell activity as a potential cancer therapy and HIV therapy.

==Early history==
In early experiments on cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor target cells, both in cancer patients and animal models, investigators consistently observed what was termed a &quot;natural&quot; reactivity; that is, a certain population of cells seemed to be able to destroy tumor cells without having been previously sensitized to them. The first published study to assert that untreated lymphoid cells were able to confer a natural immunity to tumors was performed by Dr. Henry Smith at the University of Leeds School of Medicine in 1966, leading to the conclusion that the &quot;phenomenon appear[ed] to be an expression of defense mechanisms to tumor growth present in normal mice.&quot; Other researchers had also made similar observations, but as these discoveries were inconsistent with the established model at the time, many initially considered these observations to be artifacts.

By 1973, &#x27;natural killing&#x27; activity was established across a wide variety of species, and the existence of a separate lineage of cells possessing this ability was postulated. The discovery that a unique type of lymphocyte was responsible for &quot;natural&quot; or spontaneous cytotoxicity was made in the early 1970s by doctoral student Rolf Kiessling and postdoctoral fellow Hugh Pross, in the mouse, and by Hugh Pross and doctoral student Mikael Jondal in the human. The mouse and human work was carried out under the supervision of professors Eva Klein and Hans Wigzell, respectively, of the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. Kiessling&#x27;s research involved the well-characterized ability of T lymphocytes to attack tumor cells which they had been previously immunized against. Pross and Jondal were studying cell-mediated cytotoxicity in normal human blood and the effect of the removal of various receptor-bearing cells on this cytotoxicity. Later that same year, Ronald Herberman published similar data with respect to the unique nature of the mouse effector cell.
The human data were confirmed, for the most part, by West &quot;et al.&quot; using similar techniques and the same erythroleukemic target cell line, K562. K562 is highly sensitive to lysis by human NK cells and, over the decades, the K562 51chromium-release assay has become the most commonly used assay to detect human NK functional activity. Its almost universal use has meant that experimental data can be compared easily by different laboratories around the world.

Using discontinuous density centrifugation, and later monoclonal antibodies, natural killing ability was mapped to the subset of large, granular lymphocytes known today as NK cells. The demonstration that density gradient-isolated large granular lymphocytes were responsible for human NK activity, made by Timonen and Saksela in 1980, was the first time that NK cells had been visualized microscopically, and was a major breakthrough in the field.

==Types==
NK cells can be classified as CD56bright or CD56dim. CD56bright NK cells are similar to T helper cells in exerting their influence by releasing cytokines. CD56bright NK cells constitute the majority of NK cells, being found in bone marrow, secondary lymphoid tissue, liver, and skin. CD56bright NK cells are characterized by their preferential killing of highly proliferative cells, and thus might have an immunoregulatory role. CD56dim NK cells are primarily found in the peripheral blood, and are characterized by their cell killing ability. CD56dim NK cells are always CD16 positive (CD16 is the key mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC). CD56bright can transition into CD56dim by acquiring CD16.

NK cells can eliminate virus-infected cells via CD16-mediated ADCC. All coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients show depleted CD56bright NK cells, but CD56dim is only depleted in patients with severe COVID-19.

==Receptors==
NK cell receptors can also be differentiated based on function. Natural cytotoxicity receptors directly induce apoptosis (cell death) after binding to Fas ligand that directly indicate infection of a cell. The MHC-independent receptors (described above) use an alternate pathway to induce apoptosis in infected cells. Natural killer cell activation is determined by the balance of inhibitory and activating receptor stimulation. For example, if the inhibitory receptor signaling is more prominent, then NK cell activity will be inhibited; similarly, if the activating signal is dominant, then NK cell activation will result.
NK cell receptor types (with inhibitory, as well as some activating members) are differentiated by structure, with a few examples to follow:
===Activating receptors===
*Ly49 (homodimers), relatively ancient, C-type lectin family receptors, are of multigenic presence in mice, while humans have only one pseudogenic Ly49, the receptor for classical (polymorphic) MHC I molecules.
*NCR (natural cytotoxicity receptors), type 1 transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily, upon stimulation mediate NK killing and release of IFNγ. They bind viral ligands such as hemagglutinins and hemagglutinin neuraminidases, some bacterial ligands and cellular ligands related to tumour growth such as PCNA.
*CD16 (FcγIIIA) plays a role in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; in particular, they bind immunoglobulin G.
*TLR – Toll-like receptors are receptors that belong in the group of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) which are typical for the cells of innate immunity but are expressed also on NK cells. They recognize PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) as their ligands. These receptors are crucial for the induction of the immune response. TLR induction amplifies the immune response by promoting the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and ultimately leads to the activation of NK cell effector functions. So NK cells directly react to the presence of pathogens in their surroundings. Apart from TLR-10, NK cells express all of the human TLR although in various levels. NK cells express high levels of TLR-1, moderate levels of TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-5 and TLR-6, low levels of TLR-4, TLR-8 and TLR-9 and very low levels of TLR-7. TLR receptors are constitutionally expressed independently of their state of activation and they cooperate with cytokines and chemokines on the activation of the natural killer cells. These receptors are expressed extracellularly on the cell surface or endosomally inside the endosomes. Apart from TLR-3 and TLR-4, all TLR signal through adaptor protein MyD88 which ultimately leads mainly to the activation of NF-κB. TLR-3 signals through the adaptor protein TRIF and TLR-4 can switch between signaling through MyD88 and TRIF respectively. Induction of different TLR leads to distinct activation of NK cell functions.

===Inhibitory receptors===
*Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) belong to a multigene family of more recently evolved Ig-like extracellular domain receptors; they are present in nonhuman primates, and are the main receptors for both classical MHC I (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and nonclassical Mamu-G (HLA-G) in primates. Some KIRs are specific for certain HLA subtypes. Most KIRs are inhibitory and dominant. Regular cells express MHC class 1, so are recognised by KIR receptors and NK cell killing is inhibited.
* CD94/NKG2 (heterodimers), a C-type lectin family receptor, is conserved in both rodents and primates and identifies nonclassical (also nonpolymorphic) MHC I molecules such as HLA-E. Expression of HLA-E at the cell surface is dependent on the presence of nonamer peptide epitope derived from the signal sequence of classical MHC class I molecules, which is generated by the sequential action of signal peptide peptidase and the proteasome. Though indirect, this is a way to survey the levels of classical (polymorphic) HLA molecules.
*ILT or LIR (immunoglobulin-like receptor) – are recently discovered members of the Ig receptor family. 
* Ly49 (homodimers) have both activating and inhibitory isoforms. They are highly polymorphic on the population level; though they are structurally unrelated to KIRs, they are the functional homologues of KIRs in mice, including the expression pattern. Ly49s are receptor for classical (polymorphic) MHC I molecules.

== Function ==

===Cytolytic granule mediated cell apoptosis===
NK cells are cytotoxic; small granules in their cytoplasm contain proteins such as perforin and proteases known as granzymes. Upon release in close proximity to a cell slated for killing, perforin forms pores in the cell membrane of the target cell, creating an aqueous channel through which the granzymes and associated molecules can enter, inducing either apoptosis or osmotic cell lysis. The distinction between apoptosis and cell lysis is important in immunology: lysing a virus-infected cell could potentially release the virions, whereas apoptosis leads to destruction of the virus inside. α-defensins, antimicrobial molecules, are also secreted by NK cells, and directly kill bacteria by disrupting their cell walls in a manner analogous to that of neutrophils.

===Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)===
Infected cells are routinely opsonized with antibodies for detection by immune cells. Antibodies that bind to antigens can be recognised by FcγRIII (CD16) receptors expressed on NK cells, resulting in NK activation, release of cytolytic granules and consequent cell apoptosis. This is a major killing mechanism of some monoclonal antibodies like rituximab (Rituxan), ofatumumab (Azzera), and others. The contribution of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity to tumor cell killing can be measured with a specific test that uses NK-92, an immortal line of NK-like cells licensed to NantKwest, Inc.: the response of NK-92 cells that have been transfected with a high-affinity Fc receptor are compared to that of the &quot;wild type&quot; NK-92 which does not express the Fc receptor.

===Cytokine-induced NK and Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation===
Cytokines play a crucial role in NK cell activation. As these are stress molecules released by cells upon viral infection, they serve to signal to the NK cell the presence of viral pathogens in the affected area. Cytokines involved in NK activation include IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-2, and CCL5. NK cells are activated in response to interferons or macrophage-derived cytokines. They serve to contain viral infections while the adaptive immune response generates antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that can clear the infection. NK cells work to control viral infections by secreting IFNγ and TNFα. IFNγ activates macrophages for phagocytosis and lysis, and TNFα acts to promote direct NK tumor cell killing. Patients deficient in NK cells prove to be highly susceptible to early phases of herpes virus infection. [Citation needed]

===Missing &#x27;self&#x27; hypothesis===

For NK cells to defend the body against viruses and other pathogens, they require mechanisms that enable the determination of whether a cell is infected or not. The exact mechanisms remain the subject of current investigation, but recognition of an &quot;altered self&quot; state is thought to be involved. To control their cytotoxic activity, NK cells possess two types of surface receptors: activating receptors and inhibitory receptors, including killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. Most of these receptors are not unique to NK cells and can be present in some T cell subsets, as well.

The inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I alleles, which could explain why NK cells preferentially kill cells that possess low levels of MHC class I molecules. This mode of NK cell target interaction is known as &quot;missing-self recognition&quot;, a term coined by Klas Kärre and co-workers in the late 90s. MHC class I molecules are the main mechanism by which cells display viral or tumor antigens to cytotoxic T cells. A common evolutionary adaptation to this is seen in both intracellular microbes and tumors: the chronic down-regulation of MHC I molecules, which makes affected cells invisible to T cells, allowing them to evade T cell-mediated immunity. NK cells apparently evolved as an evolutionary response to this adaptation (the loss of the MHC eliminates CD4/CD8 action, so another immune cell evolved to fulfill the function).

===Tumor cell surveillance===
Natural killer cells often lack antigen-specific cell surface receptors, so are part of innate immunity, &quot;i.e.&quot; able to react immediately with no prior exposure to the pathogen. In both mice and humans, NKs can be seen to play a role in tumor immunosurveillance by directly inducing the death of tumor cells (NKs act as cytolytic effector lymphocytes), even in the absence of surface adhesion molecules and antigenic peptides. This role of NK cells is critical to immune success particularly because T cells are unable to recognize pathogens in the absence of surface antigens. Tumor cell detection results in activation of NK cells and consequent cytokine production and release.

If tumor cells do not cause inflammation, they will also be regarded as self and will not induce a T cell response. A number of cytokines are produced by NKs, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), IFNγ, and interleukin (IL-10). TNFα and IL-10 act as proinflammatory and immunosuppressors, respectively. The activation of NK cells and subsequent production of cytolytic effector cells impacts macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, which subsequently enables antigen-specific T and B cell responses. Instead of acting via antigen-specific receptors, lysis of tumor cells by NK cells is mediated by alternative receptors, including NKG2D, NKp44, NKp46, NKp30, and DNAM. NKG2D is a disulfide-linked homodimer which recognizes a number of ligands, including ULBP and MICA, which are typically expressed on tumor cells. The role of dendritic cell—NK cell interface in immunobiology have been studied and defined as critical for the comprehension of the complex immune system.

NK cells, along with macrophages and several other cell types, express the Fc receptor (FcR) molecule (FC-gamma-RIII = CD16), an activating biochemical receptor that binds the Fc portion of IgG class antibodies. This allows NK cells to target cells against which there has been a humoral response and to lyse cells through antibody-dependant cytotoxicity (ADCC). This response depends on the affinity of the Fc receptor expressed on NK cells, which can have high, intermediate, and low affinity for the Fc portion of the antibody. This affinity is determined by the amino acid in position 158 of the protein, which can be phenylalanine (F allele) or valine (V allele). Individuals with high-affinity FcRgammRIII (158 V/V allele) respond better to antibody therapy. This has been shown for lymphoma patients who received the antibody Rituxan. Patients who express the 158 V/V allele had a better antitumor response. Only 15–25% of the population expresses the 158 V/V allele. To determine the ADCC contribution of monoclonal antibodies, NK-92 cells (a &quot;pure&quot; NK cell line) has been transfected with the gene for the high-affinity FcR.

===Clearance of senescent cells===
Natural killer cells (NK cells) and macrophages play a major role in clearance of senescent cells. Natural killer cells directly kill senescent cells, and produce cytokines which activate macrophages which remove senescent cells.

Natural killer cells can use NKG2D receptors to detect senescent cells, and kill those cells using perforin pore-forming cytolytic protein. CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes also use NKG2D receptors to detect senescent cells, and promote killing similar to NK cells. For example, in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, levels of Natural killer cells are elevated as they degrade alpha-synuclein aggregates, destroy senescent neurons, and attenuate the neuroinflammation by leukocytes in the central nervous system.

===Adaptive features of NK cells—&quot;memory-like&quot;, &quot;adaptive&quot; and memory NK cells===

The ability to generate memory cells following a primary infection and the consequent rapid immune activation and response to succeeding infections by the same antigen is fundamental to the role that T and B cells play in the adaptive immune response. For many years, NK cells have been considered to be a part of the innate immune system. However, recently increasing evidence suggests that NK cells can display several features that are usually attributed to adaptive immune cells (e.g. T cell responses) such as dynamic expansion and contraction of subsets, increased longevity and a form of immunological memory, characterized by a more potent response upon secondary challenge with the same antigen.
In mice, the majority of research was carried out with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and in models of hapten-hypersensitivity reactions. Especially, in the MCMV model, protective memory functions of MCMV-induced NK cells were discovered
and direct recognition of the MCMV-ligand m157 by the receptor Ly49 was demonstrated to be crucial for the generation of adaptive NK cell responses. 
In humans, most studies have focused on the expansion of an NK cell subset carrying the activating receptor NKG2C (KLRC2). Such expansions were observed primarily in response to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), but also in other infections including Hantavirus, Chikungunya virus, HIV, or viral hepatitis. However, whether these virus infections trigger the expansion of adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells or whether other infections result in re-activation of latent HCMV (as suggested for hepatitis
), remains a field of study. Notably, recent research suggests that adaptive NK cells can use the activating receptor NKG2C (KLRC2) to directly bind to human cytomegalovirus-derived peptide antigens and respond to peptide recognition with activation, expansion, and differentiation, a mechanism of responding to virus infections that was previously only known for T cells of the adaptive immune system.

===NK cell function in pregnancy===
As the majority of pregnancies involve two parents who are not tissue-matched, successful pregnancy requires the mother&#x27;s immune system to be suppressed. NK cells are thought to be an important cell type in this process. These cells are known as &quot;uterine NK cells&quot; (uNK cells) and they differ from peripheral NK cells. They are in the CD56bright NK cell subset, potent at cytokine secretion, but with low cytotoxic ability and relatively similar to peripheral CD56bright NK cells, with a slightly different receptor profile. These uNK cells are the most abundant leukocytes present &quot;in utero&quot; in early pregnancy, representing about 70% of leukocytes here, but from where they originate remains controversial.

These NK cells have the ability to elicit cell cytotoxicity &quot;in vitro&quot;, but at a lower level than peripheral NK cells, despite containing perforin. Lack of cytotoxicity &quot;in vivo&quot; may be due to the presence of ligands for their inhibitory receptors. Trophoblast cells downregulate HLA-A and HLA-B to defend against cytotoxic T cell-mediated death. This would normally trigger NK cells by missing self recognition; however, these cells survive. The selective retention of HLA-E (which is a ligand for NK cell inhibitory receptor NKG2A) and HLA-G (which is a ligand for NK cell inhibitory receptor KIR2DL4) by the trophoblast is thought to defend it against NK cell-mediated death.

Uterine NK cells have shown no significant difference in women with recurrent miscarriage compared with controls. However, higher peripheral NK cell percentages occur in women with recurrent miscarriages than in control groups.

NK cells secrete a high level of cytokines which help mediate their function. NK cells interact with HLA-C to produce cytokines necessary for trophoblastic proliferation. Some important cytokines they secrete include TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ, GM-CSF and TGF-β, among others. For example, IFN-γ dilates and thins the walls of maternal spiral arteries to enhance blood flow to the implantation site.

===NK cell evasion by tumor cells===
By shedding decoy NKG2D soluble ligands, tumor cells may avoid immune responses. These soluble NKG2D ligands bind to NK cell NKG2D receptors, activating a false NK response and consequently creating competition for the receptor site. This method of evasion occurs in prostate cancer. In addition, prostate cancer tumors can evade CD8 cell recognition due to their ability to downregulate expression of MHC class 1 molecules. This example of immune evasion actually highlights NK cells&#x27; importance in tumor surveillance and response, as CD8 cells can consequently only act on tumor cells in response to NK-initiated cytokine production (adaptive immune response).

===Excessive NK cells===
Experimental treatments with NK cells have resulted in excessive cytokine production, and even septic shock. Depletion of the inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma reversed the effect.

==Applications==

===Anticancer therapy===

Tumor-infiltrating NK cells have been reported to play a critical role in promoting drug-induced cell death in human triple-negative breast cancer. Since NK cells recognize target cells when they express nonself HLA antigens (but not self), autologous (patients&#x27; own) NK cell infusions have not shown any antitumor effects. Instead, investigators are working on using allogeneic cells from peripheral blood, which requires that all T cells be removed before infusion into the patients to remove the risk of graft versus host disease, which can be fatal. This can be achieved using an immunomagnetic column (CliniMACS). In addition, because of the limited number of NK cells in blood (only 10% of lymphocytes are NK cells), their number needs to be expanded in culture. This can take a few weeks and the yield is donor-dependent.

=== CAR-NK cells ===
Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are genetically modified receptors targeting cell surface antigens that provide a valuable approach to enhance effector cell efficacy. CARs induce high-affinity binding of effector cells carrying these receptors to cells expressing the target antigen, thereby lowering the threshold for cellular activation and inducing effector functions.

CAR T cells are now a fairly well-known cell therapy. However, wider use is limited by several fundamental problems: The high cost of CAR T cell therapy, which is due to the need to generate specific CAR T cells for each patient; the necessity to use only autologous T cells, due to the high risk of GvHD if allogeneic T cells are used; the inability to reinfuse CAR T cells if the patient relapses or low CAR T cell survival is observed; CAR T therapy also has a high toxicity, mainly due to IFN-γ production and subsequent induction of CRS (cytokine release syndrome) and/or neurotoxicity.

The use of CAR NK cells is not limited by the need to generate patient-specific cells, and at the same time, GvHD is not caused by NK cells, thus obviating the need for autologous cells. Toxic effects of CAR T therapy, such as CSR, have not been observed with the use of CAR NK cells. Thus, NK cells are considered an interesting &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; product option. Compared to CAR T cells, CAR NK cells retain unchanged expression of NK cell activating receptors. Thus, NK cells recognize and kill tumor cells even if, due to a tumor-escape strategy on tumor cells, ligand expression for the CAR receptor is downregulated.

NK cells derived from umbilical cord blood have been used to generate CAR.CD19 NK cells. These cells are capable of self-producing the cytokine IL-15, thereby enhancing autocrine/paracrine expression and persistence in vivo. Administration of these modified NK cells is not associated with the development of CSR, neurotoxicity, or GvHD.

The FT596 product is the first &quot;Off-the-Shelf&quot;, universal, and allogenic CAR NK cellular product derived from iPSCs to be authorized for use in clinical studies in the USA. It consists of an anti-CD19 CAR optimized for NK cells with a transmembrane domain for the NKG2D activation receptor, a 2B4 costimulatory domain and a CD3ζ signaling domain. Two additional key components were added: 1) a high-affinity, non-cleavable Fc receptor CD16 (hnCD16) that enables tumor targeting and enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity without negative regulation, combined with 2) a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting tumor cells and an IL-15/IL-15 receptor fusion protein (IL-15RF) promoting cytokine-independent persistence.

=== NK-92 cells ===
A more efficient way to obtain high numbers of NK cells is to expand NK-92 cells, an NK cell line with all the characteristics of highly active blood Natural Killer (NK) cells but with much broader and higher cytotoxicity. NK-92 cells grow continuously in culture and can be expanded to clinical-grade numbers in bags or bioreactors. Clinical studies have shown NK-92 cells to be safe and to exhibit anti-tumor activity in patients with lung or pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma. When NK-92 cells originate from a patient with lymphoma, they must be irradiated prior to infusion. Efforts, however, are being made to engineer the cells to eliminate the need for irradiation. The irradiated cells maintain full cytotoxicity. NK-92 are allogeneic (from a donor different from the recipient), but in clinical studies have not been shown to elicit significant host reaction.

Unmodified NK-92 cells lack CD-16, making them unable to perform antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC); however, the cells have been engineered to express a high affinity Fc-receptor (CD16A, 158V) genetically linked to IL-2 that is bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These high affinity NK-92 cells can perform ADCC and have greatly expanded therapeutic utility.

NK-92 cells have also been engineered to expressed chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), in an approach similar to that used for T cells. An example of this is an NK-92 derived cell engineered with both a CD16 and an anti-PD-L1 CAR; currently in clinical development for oncology indications. A clinical grade NK-92 variant that expresses a CAR for HER2 (ErbB2) has been generated and is in a clinical study in patients with HER2 positive glioblastoma. Several other clinical grade clones have been generated expressing the CARs for PD-L1, CD19, HER-2, and EGFR. PD-L1 targeted high affinity NK cells have been given to a number of patients with solid tumors in a phase I/II study, which is underway.

=== NKG2D-Fc fusion protein ===
In a study at Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, in coordination with Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, in which immunocompromised mice had contracted lymphomas from EBV infection, an NK-activating receptor called NKG2D was fused with a stimulatory Fc portion of the EBV antibody. The NKG2D-Fc fusion proved capable of reducing tumor growth and prolonging survival of the recipients. In a transplantation model of LMP1-fueled lymphomas, the NKG2D-Fc fusion proved capable of reducing tumor growth and prolonging survival of the recipients.

In Hodgkin lymphoma, in which the malignant Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells are typically HLA class I deficient, immune evasion is in part mediated by skewing towards an exhausted PD-1hi NK cell phenotype, and re-activation of these NK cells appears to be one mechanism of action induced by checkpoint-blockade.

=== TLR ligands ===
Signaling through TLR can effectively activate NK cell effector functions &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;. TLR ligands are then potentially able to enhance NK cell effector functions during NK cell anti-tumor immunotherapy.

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody that is used as a treatment of the HER2+ breast cancer. NK cells are an important part of the therapeutical effect of trastzumab as NK cells recognize the antibody coated cancer cells which induces ADCC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) reaction. TLR ligand is used in addition to trastuzumab as a means to enhance its effect. The polysaccharide krestin, which is extracted from &quot;Trametes versicolor&quot;, is a potent ligand of TLR-2 and so activates NK cells, induces the production of IFNg and enhances the ADCC caused by recognition of trastuzumab-coated cells.

Stimulation of TLR-7 induces the expression of IFN type I and other pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-12. Mice suffering with NK cell-sensitive lymphoma RMA-S were treated with SC1 molecule. SC1 is novel small-molecule TLR-7 agonist and its repeated administration reportedly activated NK cells in TLR-7- and IFN type I- dependent manner thus reversing the NK cell anergy which ultimately lead to lysis of the tumor.

VTX-2337 is a selective TLR-8 agonist and together with monoclonal antibody cetuximab it was used as a potential therapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. Results have shown that the NK cells had become more reactive to the treatment with cetuximab antibody upon pretreatment with VTX-2337. This indicates that the stimulation of TLR-8 and subsequent activation of inflammasome enhances the CD-16 mediated ADCC reaction in patients treated with cetuximab antibody.

NK cells play a role in controlling HIV-1 infection. TLR are potent enhancers of innate antiviral immunity and potentially can reverse HIV-1 latency. Incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with novel potent TLR-9 ligand MGN1703 have resulted in enhancement of NK cell effector functions, thus significantly inhibiting the spread of HIV-1 in culture of autologous CD4+ T-cells. The stimulation of TLR-9 in NK cells induced a strong antiviral innate immune response, an increase in HIV-1 transcription (indicating the reverse in latency of the virus) and it also boosted the NK cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 infections in autologous CD4+ T cells.

==New findings==

===Innate resistance to HIV===
Recent research suggests specific KIR-MHC class I gene interactions might control innate genetic resistance to certain viral infections, including HIV and its consequent development of AIDS. Certain HLA allotypes have been found to determine the progression of HIV to AIDS; an example is the HLA-B57 and HLA-B27 alleles, which have been found to delay progression from HIV to AIDS. This is evident because patients expressing these HLA alleles are observed to have lower viral loads and a more gradual decline in CD4+ T cells numbers. Despite considerable research and data collected measuring the genetic correlation of HLA alleles and KIR allotypes, a firm conclusion has not yet been drawn as to what combination provides decreased HIV and AIDS susceptibility. 

NK cells can impose immune pressure on HIV, which had previously been described only for T cells and antibodies. HIV mutates to avoid NK cell detection.

=== Tissue-resident NK cells ===
Most of our current knowledge is derived from investigations of mouse splenic and human peripheral blood NK cells. However, in recent years tissue-resident NK cell populations have been described. These tissue-resident NK cells share transcriptional similarity to tissue-resident memory T cells described previously. However, tissue-resident NK cells are not necessarily of the memory phenotype, and in fact, the majority of the tissue-resident NK cells are functionally immature. These specialized NK-cell subsets can play a role in organ homeostasis. For example, NK cells are enriched in the human liver with a specific phenotype and take part in the control of liver fibrosis. Tissue-resident NK cells have also been identified in sites like bone marrow, spleen and more recently, in lung, intestines and lymph nodes. In these sites, tissue-resident NK cells may act as reservoir for maintaining immature NK cells in humans throughout life.

=== Adaptive NK cells against leukemia targets ===
Natural killer cells are being investigated as an emerging treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells have shown promise with their enhanced antileukemia functionality. It has been shown that this kind of NK cell has enhanced interferon-γ production and cytotoxicity against leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts in patients. During a phase 1 clinical trial, five out of nine patients exhibited clinical responses to the treatment, and four patients experienced a complete remission, which suggests that these NK cells have major potential as a successful translational immunotherapy approach for patients with AML in the future.

<text>In behavioral psychology, reinforcement refers to consequences that increase the likelihood of an organism&#x27;s future behavior, typically in the presence of a particular &quot;antecedent stimulus&quot;. For example, a rat can be trained to push a lever to receive food whenever a light is turned on; in this example, the light is the antecedent stimulus, the lever pushing is the &quot;operant behavior&quot;, and the food is the &quot;reinforcer&quot;. Likewise, a student that receives attention and praise when answering a teacher&#x27;s question will be more likely to answer future questions in class; the teacher&#x27;s question is the antecedent, the student&#x27;s response is the behavior, and the praise and attention are the reinforcements.

Consequences that lead to appetitive behavior such as subjective &quot;wanting&quot; and &quot;liking&quot; (desire and pleasure) function as rewards or &quot;positive reinforcement&quot;. There is also &quot;negative reinforcement&quot;, which involves taking away an undesirable stimulus. An example of negative reinforcement would be taking an aspirin to relieve a headache.

Reinforcement is an important component of operant conditioning and behavior modification. The concept has been applied in a variety of practical areas, including parenting, coaching, therapy, self-help, education, and management.

==Terminology==
In the behavioral sciences, the terms &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; refer when used in their strict technical sense to the nature of the action performed by the conditioner rather than to the responding operant&#x27;s evaluation of that action and its consequence(s). &quot;Positive&quot; actions are those that add a factor, be it pleasant or unpleasant, to the environment, whereas &quot;negative&quot; actions are those that remove or withhold from the environment a factor of either type. In turn, the strict sense of &quot;reinforcement&quot; refers only to reward-based conditioning; the introduction of unpleasant factors and the removal or withholding of pleasant factors are instead referred to as &quot;punishment&quot;, which when used in its strict sense thus stands in contradistinction to &quot;reinforcement&quot;. Thus, &quot;positive reinforcement&quot; refers to the addition of a pleasant factor, &quot;positive punishment&quot; refers to the addition of an unpleasant factor, &quot;negative reinforcement&quot; refers to the removal or withholding of an unpleasant factor, and &quot;negative punishment&quot; refers to the removal or withholding of a pleasant factor.

This usage is at odds with some non-technical usages of the four term combinations, especially in the case of the term &quot;negative reinforcement&quot;, which is often used to denote what technical parlance would describe as &quot;positive punishment&quot; in that the non-technical usage interprets &quot;reinforcement&quot; as subsuming both reward and punishment and &quot;negative&quot; as referring to the responding operant&#x27;s evaluation of the factor being introduced. By contrast, technical parlance would use the term &quot;negative reinforcement&quot; to describe encouragement of a given behavior by creating a scenario in which an unpleasant factor is or will be present but engaging in the behavior results in either escaping from that factor or preventing its occurrence, as in Martin Seligman’s experiment involving dogs learning to avoid electric shocks.

==Introduction==

B.F. Skinner was a well-known and influential researcher who articulated many of the theoretical constructs of reinforcement and behaviorism. Skinner defined reinforcers according to the change in response strength (response rate) rather than to more subjective criteria, such as what is pleasurable or valuable to someone. Accordingly, activities, foods or items considered pleasant or enjoyable may not necessarily be reinforcing (because they produce no increase in the response preceding them). Stimuli, settings, and activities only fit the definition of reinforcers if the behavior that immediately precedes the potential reinforcer increases in similar situations in the future; for example, a child who receives a cookie when he or she asks for one. If the frequency of &quot;cookie-requesting behavior&quot; increases, the cookie can be seen as reinforcing &quot;cookie-requesting behavior&quot;. If however, &quot;cookie-requesting behavior&quot; does not increase the cookie cannot be considered reinforcing.

The sole criterion that determines if a stimulus is reinforcing is the change in probability of a behavior after administration of that potential reinforcer. Other theories may focus on additional factors such as whether the person expected a behavior to produce a given outcome, but in the behavioral theory, reinforcement is defined by an increased probability of a response.

The study of reinforcement has produced an enormous body of reproducible experimental results. Reinforcement is the central concept and procedure in special education, applied behavior analysis, and the experimental analysis of behavior and is a core concept in some medical and psychopharmacology models, particularly addiction, dependence, and compulsion.

==History==

Laboratory research on reinforcement is usually dated from the work of Edward Thorndike, known for his experiments with cats escaping from puzzle boxes. A number of others continued this research, notably B.F. Skinner, who published his seminal work on the topic in &quot;The Behavior of Organisms&quot;, in 1938, and elaborated this research in many subsequent publications. Notably Skinner argued that positive reinforcement is superior to punishment in shaping behavior. Though punishment may seem just the opposite of reinforcement, Skinner claimed that they differ immensely, saying that positive reinforcement results in lasting behavioral modification (long-term) whereas punishment changes behavior only temporarily (short-term) and has many detrimental side-effects.

A great many researchers subsequently expanded our understanding of reinforcement and challenged some of Skinner&#x27;s conclusions. For example, Azrin and Holz defined punishment as a “consequence of behavior that reduces the future probability of that behavior,” and some studies have shown that positive reinforcement and punishment are equally effective in modifying behavior. Research on the effects of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement and punishment continue today as those concepts are fundamental to learning theory and apply to many practical applications of that theory.

==Operant conditioning==
The term &quot;operant conditioning&quot; was introduced by Skinner to indicate that in his experimental paradigm, the organism is free to operate on the environment. In this paradigm, the experimenter cannot trigger the desirable response; the experimenter waits for the response to occur (to be emitted by the organism) and then a potential reinforcer is delivered. In the classical conditioning paradigm, the experimenter triggers (elicits) the desirable response by presenting a reflex eliciting stimulus, the &quot;unconditional stimulus&quot; (UCS), which they pair (precede) with a neutral stimulus, the &quot;conditional stimulus&quot; (CS).

&quot;Reinforcement&quot; is a basic term in operant conditioning. For the punishment aspect of operant conditioning, see punishment (psychology).

===Positive reinforcement===

Positive reinforcement occurs when a desirable event or stimulus is presented as a consequence of a behavior and the chance that this behavior will manifest in similar environments increases. For example, if reading a book is fun, then experiencing the fun positively reinforces the behavior of reading fun books. The person who receives the positive reinforcement (i.e., who has fun reading the book) will read more books to have more fun.

The high probability instruction (HPI) treatment is a behaviorist treatment based on the idea of positive reinforcement.
===Negative reinforcement===

Negative reinforcement increases the rate of a behavior that avoids or escapes an aversive situation or stimulus. That is, something unpleasant is already happening, and the behavior helps the person avoid or escape the unpleasantness. In contrast to positive reinforcement, which involves adding a pleasant stimulus, in negative reinforcement, the focus is on the removal of an unpleasant situation or stimulus. For example, if someone feels unhappy, then they might engage in a behavior (e.g., reading books) to escape from the aversive situation (e.g., their unhappy feelings). The success of that avoidant or escapist behavior in removing the unpleasant situation or stimulus reinforces the behavior.

Doing something unpleasant to people to prevent or remove a behavior from happening again is &quot;punishment&quot;, not negative reinforcement. The main difference is that reinforcement always increases the likelihood of a behavior (e.g., channel surfing while bored temporarily alleviated boredom; therefore, there will be more channel surfing while bored), whereas punishment decreases it (e.g., hangovers are an unpleasant stimulus, so people learn to avoid the behavior that led to that unpleasant stimulus).

===Extinction===
Extinction occurs when a given behavior is ignored (i.e. followed up with no consequence). Behaviors disappear over time when they continuously receive no reinforcement. During a deliberate extinction, the targeted behavior spikes first (in an attempt to produce the expected, previously reinforced effects), and then declines over time. Neither reinforcement nor extinction need to be deliberate in order to have an effect on a subject&#x27;s behavior. For example, if a child reads books because they are fun, then the parents&#x27; decision to ignore the book reading will not remove the positive reinforcement (i.e., fun) the child receives from reading books. However, if a child engages in a behavior to get attention from the parents, then the parents&#x27; decision to ignore the behavior will cause the behavior to go extinct, and the child will find a different behavior to get their parents&#x27; attention. 
===Reinforcement versus punishment===
Reinforcers serve to increase behaviors whereas punishers serve to decrease behaviors; thus, positive reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to attain, and negative reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to be rid of or to end. The table below illustrates the adding and subtracting of stimuli (pleasant or aversive) in relation to reinforcement vs. punishment.


===Further ideas and concepts===

* Distinguishing between positive and negative reinforcement can be difficult and may not always be necessary. Focusing on what is being removed or added and how it affects behavior can be more helpful.
* An event that punishes behavior for some may reinforce behavior for others.
* Some reinforcement can include both positive and negative features, such as a drug addict taking drugs for the added euphoria (positive reinforcement) and also to eliminate withdrawal symptoms (negative reinforcement).
* Reinforcement in the business world is essential in driving productivity. Employees are constantly motivated by the ability to receive a positive stimulus, such as a promotion or a bonus. Employees are also driven by negative reinforcement, such as by eliminating unpleasant tasks.
* Though negative reinforcement has a positive effect in the short term for a workplace (i.e. encourages a financially beneficial action), over-reliance on a negative reinforcement hinders the ability of workers to act in a creative, engaged way creating growth in the long term.

===Primary and secondary reinforcers===

A &quot;primary reinforcer&quot;, sometimes called an &quot;unconditioned reinforcer&quot;, is a stimulus that does not require pairing with a different stimulus in order to function as a reinforcer and most likely has obtained this function through the evolution and its role in species&#x27; survival. Examples of primary reinforcers include food, water, and sex. Some primary reinforcers, such as certain drugs, may mimic the effects of other primary reinforcers. While these primary reinforcers are fairly stable through life and across individuals, the reinforcing value of different primary reinforcers varies due to multiple factors (e.g., genetics, experience). Thus, one person may prefer one type of food while another avoids it. Or one person may eat much food while another eats very little. So even though food is a primary reinforcer for both individuals, the value of food as a reinforcer differs between them.

A &quot;secondary reinforcer&quot;, sometimes called a conditioned reinforcer, is a stimulus or situation that has acquired its function as a reinforcer after pairing with a stimulus that functions as a reinforcer. This stimulus may be a primary reinforcer or another conditioned reinforcer (such as money). 

When trying to distinguish primary and secondary reinforcers in human examples, use the &quot;caveman test.&quot; If the stimulus is something that a caveman would naturally find desirable (e.g. candy) then it is a primary reinforcer. If, on the other hand, the caveman would not react to it (e.g. a dollar bill), it is a secondary reinforcer. As with primary reinforcers, an organism can experience satisfaction and deprivation with secondary reinforcers.

===Other reinforcement terms===

* A generalized reinforcer is a conditioned reinforcer that has obtained the reinforcing function by pairing with many other reinforcers and functions as a reinforcer under a wide-variety of motivating operations. (One example of this is money because it is paired with many other reinforcers).
* In reinforcer sampling, a potentially reinforcing but unfamiliar stimulus is presented to an organism without regard to any prior behavior.
* Socially-mediated reinforcement involves the delivery of reinforcement that requires the behavior of another organism. For example, another person is providing the reinforcement.
* The Premack principle is a special case of reinforcement elaborated by David Premack, which states that a highly preferred activity can be used effectively as a reinforcer for a less-preferred activity.
* Reinforcement hierarchy is a list of actions, rank-ordering the most desirable to least desirable consequences that may serve as a reinforcer. A reinforcement hierarchy can be used to determine the relative frequency and desirability of different activities, and is often employed when applying the Premack principle.
* Contingent outcomes are more likely to reinforce behavior than non-contingent responses. Contingent outcomes are those directly linked to a causal behavior, such a light turning on being contingent on flipping a switch. Note that contingent outcomes are &quot;not&quot; necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.
* Contiguous stimuli are stimuli closely associated by time and space with specific behaviors. They reduce the amount of time needed to learn a behavior while increasing its resistance to extinction. Giving a dog a piece of food immediately after sitting is more contiguous with (and therefore more likely to reinforce) the behavior than a several minute delay in food delivery following the behavior.
* Noncontingent reinforcement refers to response-independent delivery of stimuli identified as reinforcers for some behaviors of that organism. However, this typically entails time-based delivery of stimuli identified as maintaining aberrant behavior, which decreases the rate of the target behavior. As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent &quot;reinforcement&quot;.

==Natural and artificial reinforcement==

In his 1967 paper, &quot;Arbitrary and Natural Reinforcement&quot;, Charles Ferster proposed classifying reinforcement into events that increase the frequency of an operant behavior as a natural consequence of the behavior itself, and events that affect frequency by their requirement of human mediation, such as in a token economy where subjects are rewarded for certain behavior by the therapist.

In 1970, Baer and Wolf developed the concept of &quot;behavioral traps.&quot; A behavioral trap requires only a simple response to enter the trap, yet once entered, the trap cannot be resisted in creating general behavior change. It is the use of a behavioral trap that increases a person&#x27;s repertoire, by exposing them to the naturally occurring reinforcement of that behavior. Behavioral traps have four characteristics:
* They are &quot;baited&quot; with desirable reinforcers that &quot;lure&quot; the student into the trap.
* Only a low-effort response already in the repertoire is necessary to enter the trap.
* Interrelated contingencies of reinforcement inside the trap motivate the person to acquire, extend, and maintain targeted skills.
* They can remain effective for long periods of time because the person shows few, if any, satiation effects.

Thus, artificial reinforcement can be used to build or develop generalizable skills, eventually transitioning to naturally occurring reinforcement to maintain or increase the behavior. Another example is a social situation that will generally result from a specific behavior once it has met a certain criterion.

== Intermittent reinforcement schedules ==

Behavior is not always reinforced every time it is emitted, and the pattern of reinforcement strongly affects how fast an operant response is learned, what its rate is at any given time, and how long it continues when reinforcement ceases. The simplest rules controlling reinforcement are continuous reinforcement, where every response is reinforced, and extinction, where no response is reinforced. Between these extremes, more complex &quot;schedules of reinforcement&quot; specify the rules that determine how and when a response will be followed by a reinforcer.

Specific schedules of reinforcement reliably induce specific patterns of response, and these rules apply across many different species. The varying consistency and predictability of reinforcement is an important influence on how the different schedules operate. Many simple and complex schedules were investigated at great length by B.F. Skinner using pigeons.

===Simple schedules===
* Ratio schedule – the reinforcement depends only on the number of responses the organism has performed.
* Continuous reinforcement (CRF) – a schedule of reinforcement in which every occurrence of the instrumental response (desired response) is followed by the reinforcer.

Simple schedules have a single rule to determine when a single type of reinforcer is delivered for a specific response.
* &quot;Fixed ratio&quot; (FR) – schedules deliver reinforcement after every &quot;n&quot;th response. An FR 1 schedule is synonymous with a CRF schedule.
* &quot;Variable ratio schedule&quot; (VR) – reinforced on average every &quot;n&quot;th response, but not always on the &quot;n&quot;th response.
* &quot;Fixed interval&quot; (FI) – reinforced after &quot;n&quot; amount of time.
* &quot;Variable interval&quot; (VI) – reinforced on an average of &quot;n&quot; amount of time, but not always exactly &quot;n&quot; amount of time.
* &quot;Fixed time&quot; (FT) – Provides a reinforcing stimulus at a fixed time since the last reinforcement delivery, regardless of whether the subject has responded or not. In other words, it is a non-contingent schedule.
* &quot;Variable time&quot; (VT) – Provides reinforcement at an average variable time since last reinforcement, regardless of whether the subject has responded or not.

Simple schedules are utilized in many differential reinforcement procedures:
* &quot;Differential reinforcement of alternative behavior&quot; (DRA) - A conditioning procedure in which an undesired response is decreased by placing it on extinction or, less commonly, providing contingent punishment, while simultaneously providing reinforcement contingent on a desirable response. An example would be a teacher attending to a student only when they raise their hand, while ignoring the student when he or she calls out.
* &quot;Differential reinforcement of other behavior&quot; (DRO) – Also known as omission training procedures, an instrumental conditioning procedure in which a positive reinforcer is periodically delivered only if the participant does something other than the target response. An example would be reinforcing any hand action other than nose picking.
* &quot;Differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior&quot; (DRI) – Used to reduce a frequent behavior without punishing it by reinforcing an incompatible response. An example would be reinforcing clapping to reduce nose picking 
* &quot;Differential reinforcement of low response rate&quot; (DRL) – Used to encourage low rates of responding. It is like an interval schedule, except that premature responses reset the time required between behavior.
* &quot;Differential reinforcement of high rate&quot; (DRH) – Used to increase high rates of responding. It is like an interval schedule, except that a minimum number of responses are required in the interval in order to receive reinforcement.

====Effects of different types of simple schedules====

* Fixed ratio: activity slows after reinforcer is delivered, then response rates increase until the next reinforcer delivery (post-reinforcement pause).
* Variable ratio: rapid, steady rate of responding; most resistant to extinction.
* Fixed interval: responding increases towards the end of the interval; poor resistance to extinction.
* Variable interval: steady activity results, good resistance to extinction.
* Ratio schedules produce higher rates of responding than interval schedules, when the rates of reinforcement are otherwise similar.
* Variable schedules produce higher rates and greater resistance to extinction than most fixed schedules. This is also known as the Partial Reinforcement Extinction Effect (PREE).
* The variable ratio schedule produces both the highest rate of responding and the greatest resistance to extinction (for example, the behavior of gamblers at slot machines).
* Fixed schedules produce &quot;post-reinforcement pauses&quot; (PRP), where responses will briefly cease immediately following reinforcement, though the pause is a function of the upcoming response requirement rather than the prior reinforcement.
** The PRP of a fixed interval schedule is frequently followed by a &quot;scallop-shaped&quot; accelerating rate of response, while fixed ratio schedules produce a more &quot;angular&quot; response.
*** fixed interval scallop: the pattern of responding that develops with fixed interval reinforcement schedule, performance on a fixed interval reflects subject&#x27;s accuracy in telling time.
* Organisms whose schedules of reinforcement are &quot;thinned&quot; (that is, requiring more responses or a greater wait before reinforcement) may experience &quot;ratio strain&quot; if thinned too quickly. This produces behavior similar to that seen during extinction.
** Ratio strain: the disruption of responding that occurs when a fixed ratio response requirement is increased too rapidly.
** Ratio run: high and steady rate of responding that completes each ratio requirement. Usually higher ratio requirement causes longer post-reinforcement pauses to occur.
* Partial reinforcement schedules are more resistant to extinction than continuous reinforcement schedules.
** Ratio schedules are more resistant than interval schedules and variable schedules more resistant than fixed ones.
** Momentary changes in reinforcement value lead to dynamic changes in behavior.

===Compound schedules===
Compound schedules combine two or more different simple schedules in some way using the same reinforcer for the same behavior. There are many possibilities; among those most often used are:
* &quot;Alternative schedules&quot;&#x27; – A type of compound schedule where two or more simple schedules are in effect and whichever schedule is completed first results in reinforcement.
* &quot;Conjunctive schedules&quot; – A complex schedule of reinforcement where two or more simple schedules are in effect independently of each other, and requirements on all of the simple schedules must be met for reinforcement.
* &quot;Multiple schedules&quot; – Two or more schedules alternate over time, with a stimulus indicating which is in force. Reinforcement is delivered if the response requirement is met while a schedule is in effect.
* &quot;Mixed schedules&quot; – Either of two, or more, schedules may occur with no stimulus indicating which is in force. Reinforcement is delivered if the response requirement is met while a schedule is in effect.
*&quot;Concurrent schedules&quot; – A complex reinforcement procedure in which the participant can choose any one of two or more simple reinforcement schedules that are available simultaneously. Organisms are free to change back and forth between the response alternatives at any time.
* &quot;Concurrent-chain schedule of reinforcement&quot;&#x27; – A complex reinforcement procedure in which the participant is permitted to choose during the first link which of several simple reinforcement schedules will be in effect in the second link. Once a choice has been made, the rejected alternatives become unavailable until the start of the next trial.
* &quot;Interlocking schedules&quot; – A single schedule with two components where progress in one component affects progress in the other component. In an interlocking FR 60 FI 120-s schedule, for example, each response subtracts time from the interval component such that each response is &quot;equal&quot; to removing two seconds from the FI schedule.
* &quot;Chained schedules&quot; – Reinforcement occurs after two or more successive schedules have been completed, with a stimulus indicating when one schedule has been completed and the next has started
* &quot;Tandem schedules&quot; – Reinforcement occurs when two or more successive schedule requirements have been completed, with no stimulus indicating when a schedule has been completed and the next has started.
* &quot;Higher-order schedules&quot; – completion of one schedule is reinforced according to a second schedule; e.g. in FR2 (FI10 secs), two successive fixed interval schedules require completion before a response is reinforced.

===Superimposed schedules===
The psychology term &quot;superimposed schedules of reinforcement&quot; refers to a structure of rewards where two or more simple schedules of reinforcement operate simultaneously. Reinforcers can be positive, negative, or both. An example is a person who comes home after a long day at work. The behavior of opening the front door is rewarded by a big kiss on the lips by the person&#x27;s spouse and a rip in the pants from the family dog jumping enthusiastically. Another example of superimposed schedules of reinforcement is a pigeon in an experimental cage pecking at a button. The pecks deliver a hopper of grain every 20th peck, and access to water after every 200 pecks.

Superimposed schedules of reinforcement are a type of compound schedule that evolved from the initial work on simple schedules of reinforcement by B.F. Skinner and his colleagues (Skinner and Ferster, 1957). They demonstrated that reinforcers could be delivered on schedules, and further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules. Rather than a reinforcer, such as food or water, being delivered every time as a consequence of some behavior, a reinforcer could be delivered after more than one instance of the behavior. For example, a pigeon may be required to peck a button switch ten times before food appears. This is a &quot;ratio schedule&quot;. Also, a reinforcer could be delivered after an interval of time passed following a target behavior. An example is a rat that is given a food pellet immediately following the first response that occurs after two minutes has elapsed since the last lever press. This is called an &quot;interval schedule&quot;.

In addition, ratio schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable number of behaviors by the individual organism. Likewise, interval schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable intervals of time following a single response by the organism. Individual behaviors tend to generate response rates that differ based upon how the reinforcement schedule is created. Much subsequent research in many labs examined the effects on behaviors of scheduling reinforcers.

If an organism is offered the opportunity to choose between or among two or more simple schedules of reinforcement at the same time, the reinforcement structure is called a &quot;concurrent schedule of reinforcement&quot;. Brechner (1974, 1977) introduced the concept of superimposed schedules of reinforcement in an attempt to create a laboratory analogy of social traps, such as when humans overharvest their fisheries or tear down their rainforests. Brechner created a situation where simple reinforcement schedules were superimposed upon each other. In other words, a single response or group of responses by an organism led to multiple consequences. Concurrent schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as &quot;or&quot; schedules, and superimposed schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as &quot;and&quot; schedules. Brechner and Linder (1981) and Brechner (1987) expanded the concept to describe how superimposed schedules and the social trap analogy could be used to analyze the way energy flows through systems.

Superimposed schedules of reinforcement have many real-world applications in addition to generating social traps. Many different human individual and social situations can be created by superimposing simple reinforcement schedules. For example, a human being could have simultaneous tobacco and alcohol addictions. Even more complex situations can be created or simulated by superimposing two or more concurrent schedules. For example, a high school senior could have a choice between going to Stanford University or UCLA, and at the same time have the choice of going into the Army or the Air Force, and simultaneously the choice of taking a job with an internet company or a job with a software company. That is a reinforcement structure of three superimposed concurrent schedules of reinforcement.

Superimposed schedules of reinforcement can create the three classic conflict situations (approach–approach conflict, approach–avoidance conflict, and avoidance–avoidance conflict) described by Kurt Lewin (1935) and can operationalize other Lewinian situations analyzed by his force field analysis. Other examples of the use of superimposed schedules of reinforcement as an analytical tool are its application to the contingencies of rent control (Brechner, 2003) and problem of toxic waste dumping in the Los Angeles County storm drain system (Brechner, 2010).

===Concurrent schedules===

In operant conditioning, concurrent schedules of reinforcement are schedules of reinforcement that are simultaneously available to an animal subject or human participant, so that the subject or participant can respond on either schedule. For example, in a two-alternative forced choice task, a pigeon in a Skinner box is faced with two pecking keys; pecking responses can be made on either, and food reinforcement might follow a peck on either. The schedules of reinforcement arranged for pecks on the two keys can be different. They may be independent, or they may be linked so that behavior on one key affects the likelihood of reinforcement on the other.

It is not necessary for responses on the two schedules to be physically distinct. In an alternate way of arranging concurrent schedules, introduced by Findley in 1958, both schedules are arranged on a single key or other response device, and the subject can respond on a second key to change between the schedules. In such a &quot;Findley concurrent&quot; procedure, a stimulus (e.g., the color of the main key) signals which schedule is in effect.

Concurrent schedules often induce rapid alternation between the keys. To prevent this, a &quot;changeover delay&quot; is commonly introduced: each schedule is inactivated for a brief period after the subject switches to it.

When both the concurrent schedules are variable intervals, a quantitative relationship known as the matching law is found between relative response rates in the two schedules and the relative reinforcement rates they deliver; this was first observed by R.J. Herrnstein in 1961. Matching law is a rule for instrumental behavior which states that the relative rate of responding on a particular response alternative equals the relative rate of reinforcement for that response (rate of behavior = rate of reinforcement). Animals and humans have a tendency to prefer choice in schedules.

==Shaping==
Shaping is the reinforcement of successive approximations to a desired instrumental response. In training a rat to press a lever, for example, simply turning toward the lever is reinforced at first. Then, only turning and stepping toward it is reinforced. Eventually the rat will be reinforced for pressing the lever. The successful attainment of one behavior starts the shaping process for the next. As training progresses, the response becomes progressively more like the desired behavior, with each subsequent behavior becoming a closer approximation of the final behavior.

The intervention of shaping is used in many training situations, and also for individuals with autism as well as other developmental disabilities. When shaping is combined with other evidence-based practices such as Functional Communication Training (FCT), it can yield positive outcomes for human behavior. Shaping typically uses continuous reinforcement, but the response can later be shifted to an intermittent reinforcement schedule.

Shaping is also used for food refusal. Food refusal is when an individual has a partial or total aversion to food items. This can be as minimal as being a picky eater to so severe that it can affect an individual&#x27;s health. Shaping has been used to have a high success rate for food acceptance.

==Chaining==
Chaining involves linking discrete behaviors together in a series, such that the consequence of each behavior is both the reinforcement for the previous behavior, and the antecedent stimulus for the next behavior. There are many ways to teach chaining, such as forward chaining (starting from the first behavior in the chain), backwards chaining (starting from the last behavior) and total task chaining (teaching each behavior in the chain simultaneously). People&#x27;s morning routines are a typical chain, with a series of behaviors (e.g. showering, drying off, getting dressed) occurring in sequence as a well learned habit.

Challenging behaviors seen in individuals with autism and other related disabilities have successfully managed and maintained in studies using a scheduled of chained reinforcements. Functional communication training is an intervention that often uses chained schedules of reinforcement to effectively promote the appropriate and desired functional communication response.

==Mathematical models== 
There has been research on building a mathematical model of reinforcement. This model is known as MPR, which is short for mathematical principles of reinforcement. Peter Killeen has made key discoveries in the field with his research on pigeons.

== Applications ==

Reinforcement and punishment are ubiquitous in human social interactions, and a great many applications of operant principles have been suggested and implemented. Following are a few examples.

===Addiction and dependence===

Positive and negative reinforcement play central roles in the development and maintenance of addiction and drug dependence. An addictive drug is intrinsically rewarding; that is, it functions as a primary positive reinforcer of drug use. The brain&#x27;s reward system assigns it incentive salience (i.e., it is &quot;wanted&quot; or &quot;desired&quot;), so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving. In addition, stimuli associated with drug use – e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use – become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug. These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become conditioned positive reinforcers of continued use. Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of drug paraphernalia as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.

In drug dependent individuals, negative reinforcement occurs when a drug is self-administered in order to alleviate or &quot;escape&quot; the symptoms of physical dependence (e.g., tremors and sweating) and/or psychological dependence (e.g., anhedonia, restlessness, irritability, and anxiety) that arise during the state of drug withdrawal.

===Animal training===

Animal trainers and pet owners were applying the principles and practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, a few of the most salient are: availability of immediate reinforcement (e.g. the ever-present bag of dog yummies); contingency, assuring that reinforcement follows the desired behavior and not something else; the use of secondary reinforcement, as in sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response; shaping, as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher; intermittent reinforcement, reducing the frequency of those yummies to induce persistent behavior without satiation; chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually put together.

=== Child behavior – parent management training ===
Providing positive reinforcement for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of parent management training. Typically, parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child). In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called &quot;successive approximations&quot;). They may also use indirect rewards such through progress charts. Providing positive reinforcement in the classroom can be beneficial to student success. When applying positive reinforcement to students, it&#x27;s crucial to make it individualized to that student&#x27;s needs. This way, the student understands why they are receiving the praise, they can accept it, and eventually learn to continue the action that was earned by positive reinforcement. For example, using rewards or extra recess time might apply to some students more, whereas others might accept the enforcement by receiving stickers or check marks indicating praise.

===Economics===

Both psychologists and economists have become interested in applying operant concepts and findings to the behavior of humans in the marketplace. An example
is the analysis of consumer demand, as indexed by the amount of a commodity that is purchased. In economics, the degree to which price influences consumption is called &quot;the price elasticity of demand.&quot; Certain commodities are more elastic than others; for example, a change in price of certain foods may have a large effect on the amount bought, while gasoline and other essentials may be less affected by price changes. In terms of operant analysis, such effects may be interpreted in terms of motivations of consumers and the relative value of the commodities as reinforcers.

=== Gambling – variable ratio scheduling ===
As stated earlier in this article, a variable ratio schedule yields reinforcement after the emission of an unpredictable number of responses. This schedule typically generates rapid, persistent responding. Slot machines pay off on a variable ratio schedule, and they produce just this sort of persistent lever-pulling behavior in gamblers. Because the machines are programmed to pay out less money than they take in, the persistent slot-machine user invariably loses in the long run. Slots machines, and thus variable ratio reinforcement, have often been blamed as a factor underlying gambling addiction.

===Praise===
The concept of praise as a means of behavioral reinforcement in humans is rooted in B.F. Skinner&#x27;s model of operant conditioning. Through this lens, praise has been viewed as a means of positive reinforcement, wherein an observed behavior is made more likely to occur by contingently praising said behavior. Hundreds of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of praise in promoting positive behaviors, notably in the study of teacher and parent use of praise on child in promoting improved behavior and academic performance, but also in the study of work performance. Praise has also been demonstrated to reinforce positive behaviors in non-praised adjacent individuals (such as a classmate of the praise recipient) through vicarious reinforcement. Praise may be more or less effective in changing behavior depending on its form, content and delivery. In order for praise to effect positive behavior change, it must be contingent on the positive behavior (i.e., only administered after the targeted behavior is enacted), must specify the particulars of the behavior that is to be reinforced, and must be delivered sincerely and credibly.

Acknowledging the effect of praise as a positive reinforcement strategy, numerous behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols. The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management and parenting training interventions, though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and behavioral rewards.

===Traumatic bonding===
Traumatic bonding occurs as the result of ongoing cycles of abuse in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.

The other source indicated that 

&#x27;The necessary conditions for traumatic bonding are that one person must dominate the other and that the level of abuse chronically spikes and then subsides. The relationship is characterized by periods of permissive, compassionate, and even affectionate behavior from the dominant person, punctuated by intermittent episodes of intense abuse. To maintain the upper hand, the victimizer manipulates the behavior of the victim and limits the victim&#x27;s options so as to perpetuate the power imbalance. Any threat to the balance of dominance and submission may be met with an escalating cycle of punishment ranging from seething intimidation to intensely violent outbursts. The victimizer also isolates the victim from other sources of support, which reduces the likelihood of detection and intervention, impairs the victim&#x27;s ability to receive countervailing self-referent feedback, and strengthens the sense of unilateral dependency ... The traumatic effects of these abusive relationships may include the impairment of the victim&#x27;s capacity for accurate self-appraisal, leading to a sense of personal inadequacy and a subordinate sense of dependence upon the dominating person. Victims also may encounter a variety of unpleasant social and legal consequences of their emotional and behavioral affiliation with someone who perpetrated aggressive acts, even if they themselves were the recipients of the aggression.

===Video games===
Most video games are designed around some type of compulsion loop, adding a type of positive reinforcement through a variable rate schedule to keep the player playing the game, though this can also lead to video game addiction.
As part of a trend in the monetization of video games in the 2010s, some games offered &quot;loot boxes&quot; as rewards or purchasable by real-world funds that offered a random selection of in-game items, distributed by rarity. The practice has been tied to the same methods that slot machines and other gambling devices dole out rewards, as it follows a variable rate schedule. While the general perception that loot boxes are a form of gambling, the practice is only classified as such in a few countries as gambling and otherwise legal. However, methods to use those items as virtual currency for online gambling or trading for real-world money has created a skin gambling market that is under legal evaluation.

==Criticisms==

The standard definition of behavioral reinforcement has been criticized as circular, since it appears to argue that response strength is increased by reinforcement, and defines reinforcement as something that increases response strength (i.e., response strength is increased by things that increase response strength). However, the correct usage of reinforcement is that something is a reinforcer &quot;because&quot; of its effect on behavior, and not the other way around. It becomes circular if one says that a particular stimulus strengthens behavior because it is a reinforcer, and does not explain why a stimulus is producing that effect on the behavior. Other definitions have been proposed, such as F.D. Sheffield&#x27;s &quot;consummatory behavior contingent on a response&quot;, but these are not broadly used in psychology.

Increasingly, understanding of the role reinforcers play is moving away from a &quot;strengthening&quot; effect to a &quot;signalling&quot; effect. That is, the view that reinforcers increase responding because they signal the behaviors that are likely to result in reinforcement. While in most practical applications, the effect of any given reinforcer will be the same regardless of whether the reinforcer is signalling or strengthening, this approach helps to explain a number of behavioral phenomena including patterns of responding on intermittent reinforcement schedules (fixed interval scallops) and the differential outcomes effect.

<text>Leon Klinghoffer (September 24, 1916 – October 8, 1985) was an American man who was shot, killed and thrown overboard from the cruise ship &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; by members of the Palestinian Liberation Front who hijacked the ship in 1985.

==Personal life==
Klinghoffer grew up on Suffolk Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Among his close friends was Jack Kirby, who grew up in the same neighborhood and who became well known for his work involving comic books.

Klinghoffer married Marilyn (born Windwehr), the daughter of a haberdasher, in September 1949. The couple had two daughters. Klinghoffer suffered two strokes later in his life that caused him to use a wheelchair.

==Career==
While he was growing up, Klinghoffer worked in his family&#x27;s hardware store, Klinghoffer Supply Company. In 1942, he joined the Army Air Force and was trained as a navigator. He flew missions in Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers with the 93rd Bombardment Group in the European theatre of World War II.
After his honorable discharge from the Army in January 1944, Klinghoffer and his brother Albert took over the store and began to invent appliances. A few years later, the two brothers founded the Roto-Broil Corporation of America. Their feature item was the Roto-Broil Rotisserie Oven or Roto-Broil 400, a common kitchen appliance during the 1950s.

==Hijacking and shooting==
In 1985, Klinghoffer (then 69, retired, and using a wheelchair) was on a cruise on the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; with his wife Marilyn to celebrate their 36th wedding anniversary. On October 7, four hijackers from the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF) took control of the liner off Egypt as it was traveling from Alexandria to Port Said, Egypt. Taking the passengers and crew hostage, they ordered the captain to travel to Tartus, Syria, and demanded the release of 50 Palestinians, then in Israeli prisons, including the Lebanese prisoner Samir Kuntar, who had been responsible for the murder of five civilians during a terrorist attack in 1979.

The hijackers said that if the prisoners were not released they would begin killing hostages: &quot;We will start executing at 3:00 p.m. sharp.&quot; Syria, having consulted with the U.S. and Italian governments, did not respond to any of the demands.

As 3:00 p.m. neared, the terrorists began to decide who to kill by shuffling the U.S., British, and Austrian hostages&#x27; passports. They selected Leon Klinghoffer to be killed first. Several reasons have been proposed that may have contributed to why Klinghoffer was chosen. Earlier in the hijacking, he had refused to be silent when gunmen took his watch and cigarettes, becoming brusque and complaining in his slurred speech; this antagonized some of the hijackers, though one of them gave Klinghoffer his possessions back. Additionally, Klinghoffer was Jewish and American, and his wheelchair made him both difficult to move around the ship and his absence less likely to cause resistance among the surviving hostages. One of the hijackers, Youssef Majed al-Molqi, later gave a statement on why he was chosen: &quot;I and Bassm [al-Ashker] agreed that the first hostage to be killed had to be an American. I chose Klinghoffer, an invalid, so that they would know that we had no pity for anyone, just as the Americans, arming Israel, do not take into consideration that Israel kills women and children of our people.&quot;

Molqi ordered Manuel De Souza, a Portuguese waiter, to accompany him and push Klinghoffer outside onto the open deck. Klinghoffer was taken back along the entire deck of the ship to the stern. Molqi ordered De Souza to return into the ship. The other terrorists moved the rest of the hostages back down into the lounge. Marilyn Klinghoffer noticed that Leon was not there and began to weep. Molqi shot Leon Klinghoffer once in the head and again in the chest. He died instantly, toppling onto his face. Molqi then went in and ordered De Souza to throw the body over the side of the ship. When De Souza was unable to do the task alone, Molqi found Italian hairdresser Ferruccio Alberti and forced the two of them at gunpoint to throw the body and then the wheelchair into the sea.

Several of the hostages heard the shots and splashes, including Marilyn Klinghoffer. She pleaded with the hijackers to let her see her husband in the infirmary, but they refused. She feared the worst but remained hopeful. She learned the truth only after the hijackers left the ship at Port Said. Molqi, with blood-splattered clothing, returned to the other terrorists and told them, &quot;I have killed the American&quot;. He and Bassam al-Ashker then went to the bridge. Handing Klinghoffer&#x27;s passport to Captain De Rosa, he raised a finger and said &quot;boom, boom&quot;.

Molqi ordered De Rosa to tell the Syrians that a passenger had been killed and that they were prepared to kill another. The Syrians responded by telling Molqi to &quot;go back where you came from&quot;. Finding no help in Syria, Molqi ordered De Rosa to move the ship to Libya. Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Foreign Secretary Farouq Qaddumi said that perhaps the terminally ill Marilyn had killed her husband for insurance money. However, the PLF leader Muhammad Zaidan said in 1996 that the hijack was a mistake, and apologized for killing Klinghoffer.

Initially, the hijackers were granted safe passage to Tunisia, but U.S. president Ronald Reagan ordered a U.S. fighter airplane to intercept the getaway airplane, forcing it to land at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Italy. After an extradition dispute, Italian authorities arrested and tried the Palestinian terrorists but decided that there was insufficient evidence to associate Abu Abbas with the hijacking.

Klinghoffer&#x27;s body was found by Syrians on October 14 or 15, and it was returned to the United States about October 20. His funeral, with 800 mourners in attendance, was performed at Temple Shaaray Tefila in New York City. Klinghoffer was buried at Beth David Memorial Park in Kenilworth, New Jersey. On February 9, four months after his death, his wife (1926–1986) died of cancer. They were survived by two daughters, Ilsa and Lisa Klinghoffer.

==Aftermath==
Five days after the murder, Rabbi Morris Gordon and a group of student activists performed a mock Jewish funeral service for Leon Klinghoffer in front of the Palestine Liberation Organization&#x27;s Washington, D.C., office to call attention to the group&#x27;s role in the killing of an American military veteran.

After the death of their parents, the Klinghoffers&#x27; daughters established the Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer Memorial Foundation with the Anti-Defamation League. The foundation combats terrorism through educational, political, and legal means. The foundation is funded by an undisclosed settlement paid by the PLO to the Klinghoffers to settle a lawsuit seeking damages for the PLO&#x27;s role in the hijacking (&quot;Klinghoffer v. PLO&quot;, 739 F. Supp. 854 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) and &quot;Klinghoffer v. PLO&quot;, 937 F.2d 44, 50 (2d Cir. 1991). This lawsuit spurred passage of the Antiterrorism Act of 1990, which made it easier for victims of terrorism to sue terrorists and collect civil damages for losses incurred.

PLF commander Muhammad Zaidan, a.k.a. Abu Abbas, was freed by the Italian government after the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; affair. The Clinton administration, aware of Abbas&#x27; arriving in Gaza, neither asked for his extradition nor requested he be given to Italy who had found him guilty in absentia. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution 99–0 asking President Bill Clinton to request Abbas&#x27; extradition to the US. He was captured in Iraq in 2003 by U.S. forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and he died in custody a year later of heart disease, according to the U.S. government.

The ship involved in the hijacking, the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot;, returned to cruise duty until it was caught afire off the coast of Somalia on November 30, 1994. After evacuating the ship of passengers, the crew could not control the fire, and the abandoned ship sank on December 2. Two people died.

==Portrayals==

The hijacking was made into a television movie in 1990, &quot;Voyage of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair&quot; featuring Burt Lancaster and Eva Marie Saint.

Karl Malden played the role of Klinghoffer in the 1989 television movie &quot;The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro&quot;.

The concept of the opera &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot; originated with theatre director Peter Sellars, who was a major collaborator, as was choreographer Mark Morris. It was American composer John Adams&#x27; second opera, based on the events of 1985. It opened to great controversy in 1991. It featured a libretto by Alice Goodman. In the opera, Klinghoffer sings two arias, one shortly before he is killed and one after his death. The Los Angeles Opera shared in the work&#x27;s commission but never presented it. The opera has since drawn controversy, including allegations by some (including Klinghoffer&#x27;s two daughters) that the opera is antisemitic and glorifies terrorism. The work&#x27;s creators and others have disputed these criticisms. A Prix Italia-winning television version of the opera, starring Sanford Sylvan and Christopher Maltman, and directed by Penny Woolcock, was screened by United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 4 in 2003.

Klinghoffer (and his supposed travel diary) play a minor role in Philip Roth&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;.

Klinghoffer is also mentioned in the graphic novel &quot;Palestine&quot; by Joe Sacco.

<text>The &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers were a class of seven heavy cruisers built for the United States Navy (USN) in the 1930s.

These ships participated in the heaviest surface battles of the Pacific War. &quot;Astoria&quot;, &quot;Quincy&quot;, and &quot;Vincennes&quot; were all sunk in the Battle of Savo Island, and three others were heavily damaged in subsequent battles in the Guadalcanal campaign.
Only &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, which spent most of the war in the Atlantic, got through the war without being damaged. Collectively, ships of the class earned 64 battle stars. The four surviving ships were laid up immediately after the end of the war, and sold for scrap in 1959.

==Design==
The &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class design was a test bed for innovations in cruiser design, and there were three distinct designs within the class.

Originally called the &quot;Astoria&quot; class, the class was renamed after &quot;USS Astoria&quot; was sunk and the surviving ships of the class underwent substantial reconstruction.
* Design #1: &quot;New Orleans&quot;, &quot;Astoria&quot;, and &quot;Minneapolis&quot;.
* Design #2: &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and &quot;San Francisco&quot;.
* Design #3: &quot;Quincy&quot; and &quot;Vincennes&quot;.

This class was the direct ancestor for all subsequent USN gun cruisers. From them came the , , , and cruisers. While the Washington Naval Treaty was still being observed, new technology was implemented in the &quot;New Orleans&quot; class because the USN knew that if and when war came, they would need this knowledge to build ships (which were already in the planning stage) beyond the treaty limits. The USN came to the conclusion that no 10,000-ton cruiser could adequately perform the roles given.

Originally was the lead ship of this class, but , and , laid down as ships, were reordered to the &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; design in 1930; and were being built in civilian rather than Navy yards and were completed as originally designed.

Three ships of the class (&quot;Astoria&quot;, &quot;Quincy&quot;, and &quot;Vincennes&quot;) were lost in the Battle of Savo Island in 1942. Immediately following the Guadalcanal campaign the remaining ships of the class went through major overhauls to lessen top-heaviness caused by new electrical and radar systems and anti-aircraft weaponry which had been added as technology advanced. In doing so, the ships took on a new appearance, most notably in the bridge area, and became known as the &quot;New Orleans&quot; class. The four survivors were decommissioned shortly after the war ended, and scrapped in 1959–1961.

==Armor==

The &quot;New Orleans&quot; class was the last series of US cruisers completed to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. As completed, the single-ship &quot;Wichita&quot; class (and subsequent heavy cruisers) exceeded the 10,000-ton standard.

Design of these ships began in early 1929, based on the three preceding classes: The , the and the &quot;Portland&quot; classes. All of the cruisers of the &quot;New Orleans&quot; class were outwardly similar but the displacement among these ships varied by some 600 tons. The Bureau of Construction and Repair authorized a contemporary gun cruiser design of smaller size, but one which allocated considerably more tonnage towards protection. The &quot;New Orleans&quot; class was noteworthy for its protection. The hull was shorter than a &quot;Northampton&quot;, with a shorter armor belt that protected only the machinery and other internal spaces, allowing its thickness to be increased to . The machinery bulkheads were given and the deck armor was strengthened to . For the first time in US cruisers, barbette and turret armor was sufficient to withstand 8-inch shellfire. The turrets were faced with 8 inches of armor, on the sides and on the roof. The barbettes were protected with 5 inches of armor on all ships except , whose barbettes were fitted with of armor.

Magazine protection was increased to . Magazine protection was further increased by placing them well below the waterline. Otherwise, only an internal splinter belt and the armor deck protected the magazines. While this allowed an exceptional degree of armored protection for the vitals against shellfire, there was little protected hull volume, and the deep magazines were more exposed to underwater damage ( learned this the hard way at the Battle of Tassafaronga). Protection represented approximately 15% of normal displacement as opposed to only 5.6% in the &quot;Pensacola&quot;s and 6% in the &quot;Northampton&quot; and &quot;Portland&quot; classes. The fuel bunkerage had to be reduced, which resulted in a smaller operational range.

== Armament ==
The main armament on the class centered on nine 8 in/55 caliber Mark 14 guns (Mark 9 guns until replaced in World War II), mounted in triple turrets. &quot;New Orleans&quot; was fitted with Mark 14 Mod 0 guns, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; with the Mark 15 Mod 1 guns and the remaining ships of the class received Mark 12 Mod 0 guns. The turret face configurations were also different with the Mark 14 guns being housed in rounded face turrets and the Mark 12 and 15 guns in a flat faced turret. The 8 in guns had a range of with a muzzle velocity of . The armor-piercing round weighed and could penetrate five inches of armor plating at . 

Secondary armament for the class consisted of eight 5 in/25 caliber dual purpose guns, which could be used against surface and aerial targets, as well as .50 caliber water-cooled machine guns to augment the 5 in guns. When the US entered the war in December 1941, the &quot;New Orleans&quot; class and other &quot;Treaty&quot; cruisers were rushed into battle with little modification and lacking in air defense. The Japanese proved at Pearl Harbor and with the sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse off Malaya that this war would be decided with air power. As soon as available, the quadruple 1.1 in guns and the Swiss-designed 20 mm Oerlikon cannon (which would replace the .50 caliber guns) were fitted, as well as early radar units and fire control directors. As the war progressed, developments in radar abilities gave the Allies an increasingly decisive advantage over the enemy. In late 1942, the arrival of the 40 mm Bofors (in twin and quadruple mountings), replaced the quadruple 1.1-inch autocannons, which had proved ineffective. 

By late 1945, even after the removal of many non-essential items (half of their spotter planes as well as a crane and a catapult became non-essential due to advances in radar) the ships became dangerously over weight because of new weaponry and electrical and radar equipment. The threat from the air was so intense this condition had to be tolerated.

== Appearance and performance ==
Outwardly, the &quot;New Orleans&quot; ships had a distinctive appearance and were considered very good-looking vessels, though the 1942–43 refits of the surviving ships changed the appearance substantially. The forward superstructure had the bridge wings cut back, and all of the large size windows were plated in with just a few port holes taking their place. The open bridge above the wheel house was enlarged by 100 percent by extending it forward. In addition several gun tubs were created for the 40 mm Bofors mounts both around the main mast, and aft. The forecastle deck extended back to the second funnel and the main superstructure was constructed without the ungainly tripod mast seen on the previous cruisers. The bow was a raked type, similar to those of British cruisers. The two funnels were situated closer together with a large search light tower in between. Aircraft handling facilities were moved further aft and a larger second conning station erected above the hangar. A single mainmast was erected there, between two huge pedestal cranes which handled both spotter planes and small craft. The main 8-inch turrets, although armored, were actually smaller with a more effective angular faceplate. By enlarging the forecastle deck, the secondary battery of 5-inch guns were mounted closer together, facilitating a more efficient ammunition delivery. 

Power was provided by eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox steam boilers that produced for the four Westinghouse gearing steam turbines. The turbines were shafted to four screws, giving this class a rated speed of . The cruisers&#x27; range – using of bunker oil – was approximately at or at . Their range could be extended by refueling from an oiler or another ship fitted to transfer oil while underway. 

The &quot;New Orleans&quot; cruisers performed peacetime exercises well with no serious shortcomings being found. While many changes were implemented to improve their performance and especially their protection, the 10,000-ton limit of the Washington Naval Treaty was not exceeded. The new cruisers were considered successful in their own right but could not be considered equal to some foreign contemporaries, which were often considerably larger.

==Ships in class==
== World War II ==
For almost four years, the ships of the &quot;New Orleans&quot; class were assigned to the most urgent of front line duties, becoming involved in much deadly action. &quot;Astoria&quot;, &quot;Quincy&quot; and &quot;Vincennes&quot; were sunk in the Battle of Savo Island, 8–9 Aug 1942. Although three of their number were lost, the ships proved to be well designed. &quot;New Orleans&quot;, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; and &quot;San Francisco&quot; were also seriously damaged in early war engagements in the Pacific. These engagements included the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, in which &quot;San Francisco&quot; engaged enemy ships at point blank range, and the Battle of Tassafaronga where &quot;Minneapolis&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot; took heavy damage and losses from Long Lance torpedoes. Damage control work and skillful seamanship kept these ships afloat to continue to fight through the end of the war.

&quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers were found at every major naval skirmish of World War II in the Pacific despite the fact there were only four of the seven units remaining after the first year of war. They were some of the most used and hardest fought ships of the US Navy during the war. Three ships of this class were among the most decorated US ships of World War II. &quot;San Francisco&quot; earned 17 Battle Stars and a Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;New Orleans&quot; earned 17 Battle Stars, and &quot;Minneapolis&quot; earned 17 Battle Stars as well. As a class, they earned a total of 64 Battle Stars and a Presidential Unit Citation.

<text>Bernburg was a district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Schönebeck, Köthen, Saalkreis, Mansfelder Land and Aschersleben-Staßfurt.

== History ==
There was an independent principality called Anhalt-Bernburg following the subdivision of the principality of Anhalt in 1603. This mini state was elevated to the rank of a duchy in 1806, and merged once more with the other parts to form a united duchy of Anhalt again in 1863.

== Geography ==
The small district of Bernburg is located in the historical region of Anhalt. The Saale River crosses the district from south to north.

<doc id="211974" wikidata="Q792312" url="?curid=211974" title="Belgian cuisine">
<text>Belgian cuisine is widely varied among regions, while also reflecting the cuisines of neighbouring France, Germany and the Netherlands. It is characterised by the combination of French cuisine with the more hearty Flemish fare. Outside the country, Belgium is best known for its chocolate, waffles, fries and beer.

Though Belgium has many distinctive national dishes, many internationally popular foods like hamburgers and &quot;spaghetti bolognese&quot; are also popular in Belgium, and most of what Belgians eat is also eaten in neighbouring countries. &quot;Belgian cuisine&quot; therefore usually refers to dishes of Belgian origin, or those considered typically Belgian.

Belgian cuisine traditionally prizes regional and seasonal ingredients. Ingredients typical in Belgian dishes include potatoes, leeks, grey shrimp, white asparagus, Belgian endive, horse meat and local beer, in addition to common European staples including meat, cheese and butter. Belgians typically eat four meals a day, with a light breakfast, medium lunch, a snack, and a large dinner.

Belgium has a plethora of local dishes and products. Examples include &quot;waterzooi&quot; from Ghent, &quot;couque&quot; biscuit from the town of Dinant, and &quot;tarte au riz&quot; from Verviers. While their local origins are acknowledged, most such dishes are enjoyed throughout Belgium.

==History==
===Prehistory and pre-Roman period===
Little is known about early Belgian cuisine. It can only be assumed that it was similar to that of other early European tribes. The ancient Belgians probably kept animals like sheep and cattle, grew root vegetables, hunted for animals such as the wild boar, fished, and foraged for berries and herbs. Beer was brewed as well, although not with hops (a later discovery).

The transition from appropriation to agriculture is thought to have occurred around 2000 BC, with migrants travelling across the continent along the Danube and Rhine rivers. Small, cultivated plots of land grew primitive varieties of wheat (e.g. emmer and einkorn), barley, and legumes (e.g. lentils and peas). Goats were bred for dairy products, sheep provided wool, and pigs provided meat. Wealthier families regularly ate meat, while the poor subsisted primarily on legumes, milk, and cereals in the form of porridge or bread.

The Celtic tribes of the Belgae, who settled in Belgium around 300 BC, brought with them not only the wheeled plough and three-field crop rotation, but also enriched the diet with poultry (e.g. chicken and geese), mead and hops beer. Salt-cured beef was exported from the British Isles to the continent.

===Gallo-Roman period===

In 54 BC, the region of northern Gaul was conquered by Caesar&#x27;s troops and passed into Roman possession for four centuries. The Roman Empire had an extensive road network, which played a significant role in the economic development of the empire, and in particular, individual cities. Active trade led to the spread of products from other regions of the empire to the territory of Gallia Belgica (e.g. olive oil and wine from the Mediterranean).

To meet the growing needs of the Roman army, increasing quantities of food were required. Thus, around the year 100 AD, tracts of forest in Belgica were cleared to plant crops. Wheat, barley and spelt were grown on fertile soils, while legumes and rye were grown on less fertile soils. New varieties of vegetables and herbs were presumably introduced to the region (e.g. cabbage and other brassicas, carrots, onions, beets, dill, coriander, and thyme), as well as many fruits (e.g. apples, pears, grapes, plums, and peaches), but they only became widespread in the 2nd century AD. Livestock numbers also increased. Some regions of Belgica specialised in the production of salted ham and pork, and were known to be a large supplier of those products for many cities across the empire.

Archaeological excavations near the town of Tienen have given insight into the cuisine of Belgica in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD: cereals (e.g. wheat, spelt, and barley), legumes (e.g. lentils, peas, and beans), fruits (e.g. plums, cherries, pears, and grapes), nuts (e.g. walnuts and hazelnuts), in addition to olive oil, porridge, bread, salt, and fennel. For most of the population, the main dish was puls: cereals mixed with water or milk, heated and with a little olive oil added, then served with lentils or beans. Another important product was bread, to which honey or legumes were sometimes added when baking. Meat was rarely eaten (either fried or in vegetable soups), except freshwater fish (e.g. eel, pike, and trout). Water was the main beverage, in addition to milk, beer, and wine diluted with water and flavoured with spices. Rich people could afford to eat meat and wine more often.

===Middles Ages and early modern===

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the ruined and decayed territories of former Belgica were settled by Franks and Germanic peoples. They combined crop cultivation and livestock farming with hunting and gathering, but abandoned some of the food traditions of Belgica, such as fish sauce. They also favoured butter over olive oil and ale over wine.

At the end of the 5th century, Clovis I united the former possessions of Gaul and founded the Frankish Kingdom. During his reign, the Franks were baptised, and from then on the church began to play an increasing role in the development of the kingdom, including greatly influencing the culinary traditions of Belgium. Presumably, the history of Belgian brewing began with breweries at monasteries, and the monks also produced cheese. In addition, the Catholic Church prescribed fasting on certain days, of which there were at least 195 per year. This led to a reduction of meat products in the diet in the 10th–11th centuries, while bread, fish and eggs became more popular.

Over time, the County of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant became some of the most economically developed regions of Europe. Instead of a three-field system, the Flemish people began to fertilise the land, which allowed them to harvest twice a year and raise more livestock. The Flemish and Brabant cities of Bruges, Antwerp, and Ghent became the largest trading cities in Europe, where the richest people settled and where goods were brought from all over the world, including spices from India and exotic fruits from warm countries.

In the 13th to 15th centuries, great importance was attached to table setting and serving dishes. From then on, dishes had to be not only filling, but also pleasing to the eye. To achieve this, before serving, dishes were decorated with greens, crumbled eggs, seasoned with spices that gave colour (e.g. saffron), and poured with sauces. The food of common people consisted mainly of bread (due to low prices, bread was eaten in large quantities), beer, vegetable soups, meat, as well as fruit pies, pancakes, and waffles. Most often they ate beef and lamb; only wealthy families could afford pork, poultry and game.

In the 15th century, the port city of Antwerp became one of the most important economic centres in Europe. With the discovery of America, products such as potatoes, tomatoes, turkey, and cocoa became available. Brewing also developed intensively in Antwerp. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the first cookbooks appeared in Belgium. While the menu of wealthy Belgians consisted of a variety of dishes and elaborate desserts, the poor still subsisted on bread, beer and vegetable soups. Potatoes were initially perceived as pig feed, but by 1830 they had become the staple dish of the poor.

===Late modern and contemporary===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Flemish cities lost their former importance, and the French-speaking territories of Belgium, especially Liège and Mons, took the lead. Many culinary traditions came to Wallonia from neighbouring France. First of all, various meat and fish dishes, expensive seafood (e.g. lobsters and oysters), as well as exotic fruits (e.g. pineapple and melon), became popular dishes at that time; seasonal vegetables went out of fashion. Sauces, potatoes, and offal were widely used. In the 19th century, restaurants began to appear; cookbooks were now published for the middle class as well.

As a result of the Belgian Revolution of 1830, Belgium gained its independence. Brussels was chosen as the capital of the new kingdom, where young dynamic businessmen, diplomats, and politicians settled. An increasing number of restaurants, cafés, and bars appeared in the capital, some of which were recognised as the best in Europe. Brussels chefs successfully combined French cuisine with elements of Flemish and Walloon dishes. The city is also known as the birthplace of the Belgian endive. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode.

In the 20th century, more exotic fruits and vegetables were introduced (e.g. bananas, kiwis, avocados, sweet peppers and aubergines), which gradually entered the everyday life of Belgians only with the spread of supermarkets. Many products became available to the working class. Some culinary traditions were lost because working class women, in order to save time, began to cook only the simplest and most nourishing dishes. At the same time, convenience foods and fast food became increasingly popular (e.g. &quot;spaghetti bolognese&quot;, pizza, and hamburgers), which negatively affected the nation&#x27;s health. Recently, Belgians have become more health-conscious, so many families favour light, healthy meals with lots of vegetables, as well as fresh, natural products without chemical additives.

==Belgian cuisine==

===Appetizers===
* &quot;Tartines/Boterhammen&quot;: slices of rustic bread and an uncovered spread, often &quot;pâté&quot; or soft cheese, served on a cutting board. Typical spreads include &quot;Americain&quot;, &quot;pâté&quot;, and &quot;saucisson&quot;.

==Belgian fries==

Fries, deep-fried chipped potatoes, are very popular in Belgium, where they are thought to have originated. The earliest evidence of the dish comes from a book entitled &quot;Curiosités de la table dans les Pays-Bas-Belgiques&quot; written in 1781, which described how inhabitants of Namur, Dinant and Andenne around the river Meuse had eaten fried potatoes since around 1680. Though they are usually known as &quot;French fries&quot; in the United States, it is argued that American soldiers during the First World War called them &quot;French fries&quot; because the Belgian soldiers who introduced them to the dish spoke French.

In Belgium, fries are sold at fast-food stands or in dedicated fast-food restaurants called &quot;friteries&quot;, &quot;frietkot&quot;, or &quot;frituur&quot; (loosely: “fry shack”). They are often served with a variety of sauces and eaten either on their own or in the company of other snacks. Traditionally, they are served in a &quot;cornet de frites&quot; (French) or &quot;&quot; (Flemish), a cone-shaped white piece of thick paper then wrapped in a piece of thin (and coloured) paper, with the sauce on the top. Larger portions are often served in cardboard trays for practicality&#x27;s sake. Other street foods like &quot;frikandel&quot;, &quot;gehaktbal&quot; or &quot;kroket&quot; are sold alongside. In some cases, the fries are served in the form of a baguette sandwich along with their sauce and meat; this is known as a &quot;mitraillette&quot;. In areas with immigration, the same combination is also available in a wrap called a &quot;dürüm&quot; instead of on a baguette.

The vast majority of Belgian households have a deep fryer, allowing them to make their own fries and other deep-fried foods at home. Supermarkets sell a range of liquid and solid animal- and plant-based fats for use in home deep fryers; beef fat is particularly prized.

In June 2017 the European Commission issued a recommendation to limit the chemical acrylamide—a natural result of frying some foods at high temperatures—from reaching consumers, due to its alleged carcinogenic properties. The document proposed a change in the preparation of Belgian fries to prevent the formation of acrylamide, by blanching them before frying, as opposed to the traditional method of double frying. This led to a wave of protests from several Belgian politicians, who viewed it as an assault on the country&#x27;s culture and gastronomical tradition.

===Sauces===
Traditionally, fries are usually served with mayonnaise in Belgium. Friteries and other fast-food establishments tend to offer a number of different sauces for the fries and meats, including &quot;aïoli&quot; and &quot;sauce américaine&quot; but also much more elaborate varieties, including béarnaise sauce. There are frequently over a dozen options, and most of them are mayonnaise-based, so the varieties include:

* &quot;Aïoli&quot;/&quot;Looksaus&quot;: garlic mayonnaise.
* Algérienne sauce: mayonnaise with mustard, shallot, black pepper, vinegar, and chili pepper or harissa, and sometimes also tomato or tomato sauce, anchovies, or capers.
* &quot;Sauce américaine&quot;: mayonnaise with tomato, chervil, onions, capers, crustacean stock, and celery.
* &quot;Sauce andalouse&quot;: mayonnaise with tomato paste and peppers.
* Bicky sauce: a commercial brand made from mayonnaise, white cabbage, tarragon, dough, cucumber, onion, mustard, and dextrose.
* Brazilian sauce: mayonnaise with pureed pineapple, tomato, and spices.
* Cocktail sauce: one of several types of cold or room temperature sauces often served as part of the dish(es) referred to as a seafood cocktail or as a condiment with other seafood.
* Curry ketchup: a spiced variant on ketchup and a common sauce in Belgium, Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands.
* Curry mayonnaise: mayonnaise with either turmeric, cumin, ginger, and fresh or dried hot chili peppers.
* Joppiesaus: a commercial brand made from mayonnaise, spices, onion, and curry powder.
* Ketchup: a sweet and tangy sauce typically made from tomatoes, sweetener, and vinegar with assorted seasonings and spices.
* Mammoet sauce: mayonnaise with tomato, onion, glucose, garlic, and soy sauce.
* Mayonnaise: a thick cold sauce or dressing usually used in sandwiches and composed salads.
* Pepper sauce: mayonnaise or hot sauce with black pepper.
* Relish—a cooked and pickled product made of chopped vegetables, fruits, or herbs, and is a food item typically used as a condiment, in particular, to enhance a staple.
* &quot;Sauce lapin&quot;: a sauce made from &quot;sirop de Liège&quot;, cooked with raisins, onions, prunes, and cloves, typically served with &quot;boulets à la Liégeoise&quot;.
* &quot;Sauce riche&quot;: a pink, tartar-based sauce.
* Samurai sauce: mayonnaise with Tunisian chili, spices, tomatoes, and bell peppers.
* Tartar sauce: a mayonnaise or &quot;aïoli&quot;-based sauce of French origin, and is typical of a rough consistency due to the addition of diced gherkins or other varieties of pickles.
* Zigeuner sauce: a &quot;gypsy&quot; sauce of tomatoes, paprika, and chopped bell peppers, borrowed from Germany.

Occasionally, warm sauces are offered by &quot;friteries&quot;, including Hollandaise sauce, Provençale sauce, béarnaise sauce, or even a &quot;carbonade flamande&quot;. Most of the sauces above are also readily available in supermarkets. The use of these sauces is not limited to fries; they are used on a variety of other dishes as well.

==Beer==

For a comparatively small country, Belgium produces a very large number of beers in a range of different styles—in fact, it has more distinct types of beer per capita than anywhere else in the world. In 2011, there were 1,132 different varieties of beer being produced in the country. The brewing tradition in Belgium can be traced back to the early Middle Ages and six Trappist monasteries still produce beer, which was initially used to fund their upkeep.

On average, Belgians drink 157 litres of beer each year, down from around 260 each year in 1900. Most beers are bought or served in bottles, rather than cans, and almost every style of beer has its own particular, uniquely shaped glass or other drinking vessel. Using the correct glass is considered to improve the beer&#x27;s flavour.

The varied nature of Belgian beers makes it possible to match them against each course of a meal. For instance:
* Wheat beer with seafood or fish
* Blonde or Tripel beers with eel, chicken or white meat
* Dubbel or other dark beers with dark meat
* Fruit lambics with dessert

A number of traditional Belgian dishes use beer as an ingredient. One is &quot;carbonade&quot;, a stew of beef cooked in beer, similar to beef bourguignon. The beer used is typically the regional speciality—lambic in Brussels, De Koninck in Antwerp—so that the taste of the dish varies. Another is rabbit in &quot;gueuze&quot;. The Trappist monastery at Chimay also manufactures cheese that is &quot;washed&quot; with beer to enhance its flavour.

==Jenever==
Jenever, also known as &quot;genièvre&quot;, &quot;genever&quot;, &quot;peket&quot; or &quot;Dutch gin&quot;, is the national spirit of Belgium from which gin evolved. While beer may be Belgium&#x27;s most famous alcoholic beverage, jenever has been the country&#x27;s traditional and national spirit for over 500 years. Jenever is a &quot;Protected Product of Origin&quot;, having received eleven different appellations or AOCs from the European Union, and can only be crafted in Belgium, the Netherlands and a few areas in France and Germany. Most of the jenever AOC&#x27;s are exclusive to Belgium making Belgian jenever (Belgian genever) one of the best-kept secrets in the liquor industry.

For centuries jenever has been bottled in jugs handcrafted from clay. Its iconic shape is recognizable and unique to jenever. Traditionally the Belgians serve jenever in completely full shot glasses that have just been pulled from the freezer. The first step to drinking the jenever is to keep the glass on the table, bend down and take the first sip without holding the glass. Once this traditional first sip is completed one can drink the rest of the drink normally.

==Chocolate==

Belgium is famed for its high quality chocolate and over 2,000 &quot;chocolatiers&quot;, both small and large. Belgium&#x27;s association with chocolate goes back as far as 1635 when the country was under Spanish occupation. By the mid-18th century, chocolate had become extremely popular in upper and middle class circles, particularly in the form of hot chocolate, including with Charles-Alexander of Lorraine, the Austrian governor of the territory. From the early 20th century, the country was able to import large quantities of cocoa from its African colony, the Belgian Congo. Both the chocolate bar and praline are inventions of the Belgian chocolate industry. Today, chocolate is very popular in Belgium, with 172,000 tonnes produced each year, and widely exported.

The composition of Belgian chocolate has been regulated by law since 1884. In order to prevent adulteration of the chocolate with low-quality fats from other sources, a minimum level of 35% pure cocoa was imposed. Adherence to traditional manufacturing techniques also serves to increase the quality of Belgian chocolate. In particular, vegetable-based fats are not used. Many firms produce chocolates by hand, which is laborious and explains the prevalence of small, independent chocolate outlets, which are popular with tourists. Famous chocolate companies, like Neuhaus and Guylian, strictly follow traditional (and sometimes secret) recipes for their products.

Seafood pralines (pralines shaped like sea shells or fish) are popular with tourists and are sold all over Belgium.

Famous Belgian chocolatiers include Côte d&#x27;or, Leonidas, Guylian and Neuhaus.

<text>Phoenix (also known as Trupa Phoenix in Romania) or for a short time Sfinții ( The Saints) is a Romanian rock band formed in 1962 in Timișoara by guitarists Nicu Covaci and Kamocsa Béla. Guitarist Claudiu Rotaru, vocalist Florin &quot;Moni&quot; Bordeianu and drummer Ioan &quot;Pilu&quot; Ștefanovici completed the early lineup. The group became famous in Romania in the 1970s when it started fusing their 1960s rock and roll sound with traditional folk music, thus pioneering the &quot;ethno rock&quot; subgenre.

After gaining popularity in Romania during the so-called British invasion in the mid-60s, the group changed its style to integrate Romanian folklore elements after vocalist Florin &quot;Moni&quot; Bordeianu emigrated to the United States. A new &quot;LP&quot; was released in 1972 and the band represented Romania in various Eastern Bloc music festivals throughout the 1970s. The group disbanded in 1977, when they illegally fled to West Germany. Latter attempts to regroup the members, both in West Germany and in Romania after 1990, failed to achieve the original success. They have been estimated to have sold over 2 million albums in Romania.

==History==
===Origins===
Phoenix was launched in the cosmopolitan city of Timișoara in 1962 by a pair of schoolboys: Nicu Covaci and Béla Kamocsa, under the name of Sfinții (&quot;The Saints&quot;). In their first years, together with Florin &quot;Moni&quot; Bordeianu (born 1948), they performed in school contests and at local clubs, covering Western music hits from The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Who, etc., and they quickly became very popular among the youth. In 1965 the Communist authorities demanded that the band stop performing under the name &quot;The Saints&quot;, because of the religious innuendo that the name carried. Forced to comply, the band took the name &quot;Phoenix&quot;. Nicu Covaci also changed the composition of the band, around 1963, by adding Claudiu Rotaru, Ioan &quot;Pilu&quot; Ștefanovici (born 1946) and Günther &quot;Spitzly&quot; Reininger (born 1950) to the lineup.

In 1965 they had their first big concert in Bucharest. Their performance brought a collaboration with Cornel Chiriac to record some of their songs. The first songs they recorded were &quot;Știu că mă iubesti și tu&quot; (&quot;I Know You Love Me Too&quot;), &quot;Dunăre, Dunăre&quot; (&quot;Danube, Danube&quot;) and &quot;Bun e vinul ghiurghiuliu&quot; (&quot;Good is the Red Wine&quot;). The same year also marked the beginning of their collaboration with Victor Suvagau, who went on to write many of their most famous songs, such as &quot;Vremuri&quot; (&quot;Old Times&quot;), &quot;Și totuși ca voi sunt&quot; (&quot;And Yet I Am Like You&quot;), &quot;Nebunul cu ochii închiși&quot; (&quot;The Fool with Eyes Closed&quot;), &quot;Floarea stîncilor&quot; (&quot;Mountain Flower&quot;) and &quot;Canarul&quot; (&quot;Canary&quot;).

In December 1967 Phoenix had their first major series of concerts in many western cities, capped off by two huge concerts in Timișoara. After winning a few prizes in national students&#x27; contests, held at Iași the following year, in 1968 they recorded their first EP, &quot;Vremuri&quot;, containing two original songs, &quot;Vremuri&quot; and &quot;Canarul&quot;, and two covers (&quot;Lady Madonna&quot; – The Beatles and &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; – The Easybeats). A second EP would follow one year later, named &quot;Floarea stîncilor&quot; (&quot;The Flower of the Rocks&quot;), with all four songs being original compositions. Both albums sport a sound reminiscent of the &quot;beat&quot; style popular in those days.

They then started working on a rock theater play &quot;Omul 36/80&quot; (&quot;The Man 36/80&quot;) which won several prizes for originality.

In 1969 Ioan &quot;Pilu&quot; Ștefanovici was replaced by Dorel &quot;Baba&quot; Vintilă Zaharia (born 1943). For the next year the band became more and more popular, frequently visiting Bucharest and being invited onto talk shows about music.

===The 1970s===
In 1970, Moni Bordeianu emigrated to the United States. 1970 was the blues period of the band. The band was Nicu Covaci, guitar, Günther &quot;Spitzly&quot; Reininger, piano and vocals, Zoltán Kovács, bass guitar and Liviu Butoi, oboe and flute. &quot;Phoenix&quot; was born again the next year, with Covaci, Josef Kappl, Mircea Baniciu, Costin Petrescu (replaced in 1974 by Ovidiu Lipan, nicknamed &quot;Țăndărică&quot;) and Valeriu Sepi.

But the Communist officials were not very comfortable with the Western-style music that they were singing, and kept creating problems for them. So &quot;Phoenix&quot; abandoned &quot;beat&quot; and turned to Romanian folklore, pagan rituals, mystic animals and old traditions. In this same year, Phoenix started a collaboration with the Institute of Ethnography and Folklore and the Folklore section of Timișoara University on an ambitious project, a rock poem that combined traditional wooden instruments with modern sounds. During this project the band also started collaborating with Valeriu Sepi (born 1947), who eventually joined the band. The first outcome would be the 1972 LP &quot;Cei ce ne-au dat nume&quot; (&quot;Those Who Gave Us a Name&quot;) – the second LP to be recorded in Romania by a Romanian band. Two years later, &quot;Mugur de fluier&quot; (&quot;Flute Bud&quot;) followed. Both albums underwent severe censorship.

In 1973 Phoenix represented Romania at the &quot;Golden Harp&quot; festival in Bratislava (Slovakia), and then at the &quot;Disc festival&quot; in Sopot (Poland). Also, they wanted to record a new rock-opera, named &quot;Meșterul Manole&quot;, but the communist officials censored it all, by &quot;losing&quot; the unique book with costume sketches and lyrics given to them for official approval. The result was only an EP with an extract from the opera, &quot;Meșterul Manole, uvertură&quot; (&quot;Master Manole, overture&quot;) and two older songs, &quot;Mamă, Mamă&quot; (&quot;Mother, Mother&quot;) and &quot;Te întreb pe tine, soare...&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m asking you, sun...&quot;).

On Monday, 19 November 1973, Phoenix held a concert in Bucharest, presenting their new hits &quot;Andrii Popa&quot;, &quot;Pavel Cneazul&quot;, &quot;Mica Țiganiadă&quot; and &quot;Strunga&quot; which composed the new disc &quot;Mugur de fluier&quot;. The new songs were still influenced by folklore yet had a new style. This style was the result of the collaboration with new songwriters Andrei Ujică and Șerban Foarță. Based on those new songs Nicu Covaci created a new show &quot;Introducere la un concert despre muzica veche la români&quot; (&quot;Introduction to a concert about old Romanian music&quot;) in which he introduced violins, flutes, archaic percussion and other traditional instruments. The show was never finished due to a new collaboration with &quot;Cenaclul Flacăra&quot;. This period is considered the peak for Phoenix.

Every winter the members of the band would retreat to Mount Semenic and plan their upcoming songs. That winter the show &quot;Zoosophia&quot;, a title that would later change to &quot;Cantafabule&quot;, was created. The show began by &quot;calling&quot; all mythic animals and continued by dedicating a song to each of them, finishing with the Phoenix, the band&#x27;s symbol. The year 1975 brought a newcomer to the band, Ovidiu Lipan &quot;Țăndărică&quot; (born 1953). The &quot;Cantafabule&quot; show was first presented in Timișoara in February 1975. The disc was recorded in a short time and was published the same year with a misspelling in the title: &quot;Cantofabule.&quot;

By this time, Phoenix had become quite popular, both for the songs and the thinly-veiled allusions to the Communist regime. The band members, especially Nicu Covaci, were increasingly harassed by the Securitate. Covaci married a Dutch woman and left the country in 1976. He returned in 1977, bringing in relief aid for those struck by the powerful earthquake on 4 March. After two grandiose concerts in Constanța and Tulcea, Covaci left the country again, this time with all the band members (except Baniciu) hidden inside their Marshall speakers: at the time it was extremely difficult to obtain approval to travel abroad and illegal border crossing was punished by imprisonment.

===The 1980s===
After fleeing Communist Romania in 1977 via Yugoslavia and after ultimately arriving in West Germany, Phoenix shortly thereafter disbanded. Kappl and a few other members (i.e. &quot;Erlend Krauser and Ovidiu Lipan&quot;) formed a new band called &quot;Madhouse&quot; and released a less successful album entitled &quot;From The East&quot;. In 1981, Covaci co-opted Neumann and Lipan and English bassist Tom Buggie, under the name &quot;Transsylvania Phoenix&quot; (since a band named &quot;Phoenix&quot; already existed) and released an LP named &quot;Transsylvania&quot;, containing two old Phoenix songs translated into English to target the Western audience and five new ones. Covaci together with Kappl also released two EPs and one maxi single as Transsylvania-Phoenix.

===Comeback===

In 1990, Phoenix made a modest comeback to Romania. Although they were expected to sing their first song in their hometown Timișoara, the city that sparked the Romanian Revolution of 1989 that eventually led to the downfall of the Communist regime, their first &quot;post-1989&quot; concert took place in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. Internal conflicts, especially between Covaci and Baniciu, were making headlines in the media.

A new studio album was released in 2000, the first original album after their 1990 comeback attempt; with the exception of Covaci, the lineup comprised none of the members from the &#x27;70s.

In 2002, the 40th anniversary of the band brought together some of the former members.

At the end of 2005 the band released a new album, named &quot;Baba Novak&quot;, in its classic gold lineup.

As of 2010, the band still performed at live events.
In 2014, they recorded the album called &quot;Vino, Țepeș!&quot;.

<text>Edward Joseph Money ( Mahoney; March 21, 1949September 13, 2019) was an American singer and songwriter who, in the 1970s and 1980s, had eleven Top 40 songs, including &quot;Baby Hold On&quot;, &quot;Two Tickets to Paradise&quot;, &quot;Think I&#x27;m in Love&quot;, &quot;Shakin&#x27;, &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Go Back&quot;, &quot;Endless Nights&quot;, &quot;Walk on Water&quot;, and &quot;The Love in Your Eyes&quot;. Critic Neil Genzlinger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him a working-class rocker. In 1987, he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;.

== Early life ==

Edward Joseph Mahoney was born in Manhattan, New York City on March 21, 1949, to a large family of Irish Catholic descent. His parents were Dorothy Elizabeth (), a homemaker, and Daniel Patrick Mahoney, a police officer. He grew up in Levittown, New York, but spent some teenage years in Woodhaven, Queens, New York City. Money was a street singer from the age of eleven. As a teenager, he played in rock bands, in part to get dates from cheerleaders. He was thrown out of one high school for forging a report card. In 1967, he graduated from Island Trees High School. 

At the age of 18, he tried to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, father, and brother as a New York City Police Department trainee. However, after working as a clerk and typist, he left in 1968 to pursue a career in music, as the police did not allow him to grow his hair long. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t see myself in a police uniform for 20 years of my life, with short hair,&quot; he later said. His bandmates also fired him because they did not want a police officer in the group. His father was not happy with his decision to play music and tore Jimi Hendrix posters from his wall. He began studying saxophone during a brief stint at junior college, inspired by rock musicians like David Bowie and Van Morrison who occasionally used the instrument.

In 1968, Money moved to Berkeley, California. There, he studied with vocal coach Judy Davis, and took on the stage name Eddie Money, dropping two letters from his last name and sarcastically referring to the fact that he was always broke.

== Career ==

=== Music career ===

Money became a regular performer at clubs in the San Francisco Bay Area. After gaining the attention of Bill Graham, he secured a recording contract with Columbia Records, releasing his debut album in 1977. He charted with singles such as &quot;Baby Hold On&quot; and &quot;Two Tickets to Paradise&quot;, about visiting his girlfriend despite not having money.

In 1978, Money opened for Santana at Boston&#x27;s Music Hall. The following year, he sang backing vocals on the bridge section on &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot;, a song written and performed by Kenny Loggins. In 2014, Money claimed that Loggins never gave him credit for his contribution.

In 1982, Money took advantage of the MTV music video scene with his humorous narrative videos for &quot;Think I&#x27;m in Love&quot;, performed at The Mission Inn Hotel &amp; Spa, and &quot;Shakin&#x27;&quot;. In the early 1980s, he appeared on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;Fridays&quot;, and &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. In 1978 and 1984, he appeared on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;.

Money&#x27;s career slumped following the commercially unsuccessful 1983 album &quot;Where&#x27;s the Party?&quot;. However, he made a comeback in 1986 with the album &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Back&quot;, which received a music recording certification of platinum. &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;, a single from the album, peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. Money only agreed to perform the songwhich included a line from &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, a song Ronnie Spector performed as part of The Ronettesafter Spector agreed to sing the line herself. In 1987, Money was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;. &quot;I Wanna Go Back&quot; and &quot;Endless Nights&quot;two other singles from the &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Back&quot; albumpeaked at No. 14 and No. 21, respectively.

In 1988, Money released &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, which featured the Top 10 hit &quot;Walk on Water&quot; and the Top 40 hit &quot;The Love in Your Eyes&quot;.

Beginning in 1992, Money opened the summer concert season for the Pine Knob Music Theater in Clarkston, Michigan where he would return to open the venue for 27 consecutive years. In 1996, he wrote the theme music to &quot;Quack Pack&quot;, a Disney cartoon.

Money was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2008. In January 2010, he performed a medley of his hit singles during the halftime performance at the Liberty Bowl.

Money wrote and performed original songs for the films &quot;Americathon&quot; (1979), &quot;Over the Top&quot;, &quot;Back to the Beach&quot; (both 1987), and &quot;Kuffs&quot; (1992), along with the television series &quot;Hardball&quot; (19891990).

In the three days following Money&#x27;s death, fans streamed &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot; more than 3.1million times, which was an increase of 349 percent compared to the previous three-day period. Fans also streamed his other songs by 931 percent more than the three previous days.

=== Television, film, and radio career ===

Money made several screen appearances.

In 1997, he appeared in &quot;Wonderland&quot;, a documentary film about Levittown, New York, where Money went to high school. In the film, he said if he had &quot;two tickets to paradise, I&#x27;d probably get back to Levittown&quot;.

Money played a fictionalized version of himself on a 1999 episode of season 5 of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. In the episode, he had been Mimi Bobeck&#x27;s first husband early in his career and they were long separated but never officially divorced. In May 2002, he played himself on an episode of the sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot;.

In October 2011, Money became the host of &quot;Money in the Morning&quot;, a radio show on WSRV. The gig lasted about three months. He appeared in a 2012 GEICO insurance commercial in which he is depicted as a travel agency owner who sings &quot;Two Tickets to Paradise&quot; to a family that wants tickets for a vacation.

Soon after, Money partnered with Howard Perl Entertainment, to produce special projects, including &quot;Money for the Animals&quot;, a tour with MTV VJ Nina Blackwood, designed to raise funds and adopt rescue animals in need.

In 2018, Money appeared in episode 6 of &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot; as a fictionalized version of himself who is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service and portrays the character Freddie Money in an eponymous tribute act at a casino to avoid further tax problems.

On April 8, 2018, &quot;Real Money&quot;, a reality television series about Money and his family, debuted on AXS TV. An episode sharing his cancer diagnosis aired on AXS TV the day before he died. The show&#x27;s second season was expected to follow Money&#x27;s &quot;journey as he tells his family about the disease and undergoes treatment.&quot;

In late April 2018, Weekly Alibi&#x27;s August March interviewed Money, who discussed his career, his family, and his new television show.

== Personal life and death ==

In 1980, after drinking alcohol, Money overdosed on a synthetic barbiturate that he mistook for cocaine. He suffered damage to the sciatic nerve on his left leg, was unable to walk for months, and had a permanent limp thereafter.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1984 in Moraga, California, Money married Margo Lee Walker, a student from Los Angeles. Money and his bride tried to keep the wedding private, &quot;but a crowd of screaming teenage fans showed up.&quot;

Money married Laurie Harris in 1989. Together, they had five children: Zachary, Jesse (Jessica), Joseph, Julian, and Desmond. They were married for 30 years and had renewed their vows three months before his death.

In March 2000, Money purchased a home in Westlake Village, California, where he lived with his family. At one point in the early 2000s, Money also had a home in Island Estates, a gated community in Palm Coast, Florida, which he called &quot;my place to play golf, be creative, go fishing, go surfing and have fun&quot;.

In 2001, Money joined a 12-step program to deal with his drinking and made a promise to his wife and children that he would change. In 2003, he reported that he was clean and sober.

Money—who had been a cigarette smoker for years—developed pneumonia following a minimally invasive heart valve replacement surgery in July 2019, causing him to cancel tour dates. On August 24, 2019, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer; he died of complications from the cancer at Keck Hospital of USC in Los Angeles on September 13, 2019, at age 70. A year later, his family filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful death against the hospital, with an additional allegation of medical malpractice.

<text>From the viewpoint of physics (dynamics, to be exact), a firearm, as for most weapons, is a system for delivering maximum destructive energy to the target with minimum delivery of energy on the shooter. The momentum delivered to the target, however, cannot be any more than that (due to recoil) on the shooter. This is due to conservation of momentum, which dictates that the momentum imparted to the bullet is equal and opposite to that imparted to the gun-shooter system.

== Firearm energy efficiency ==
From a thermodynamic point of view, a firearm is a special type of piston engine, or in general heat engine where the bullet has a function of a piston. The energy conversion efficiency of a firearm strongly depends on its construction, especially on its caliber and barrel length. 
However, for illustration, here is the energy balance of a typical small firearm for .300 Hawk ammunition:
*Barrel friction 2%
*Projectile motion 32%
*Hot gases 34%
*Barrel heat 30%
*Unburned propellant 1%.
which is comparable with a typical piston engine.

Higher efficiency can be achieved in longer barrel firearms because they have better volume ratio. However, the efficiency gain is less than corresponding to the volume ratio, because the expansion is not truly adiabatic and burnt gas becomes cold faster because of exchange of heat with the barrel. Large firearms (such as cannons) achieve smaller barrel-heating loss because they have better volume-to-surface ratio.
High barrel diameter is also helpful because lower barrel friction is induced by sealing compared to the accelerating force. The force is proportional to the square of the barrel diameter while sealing needs are proportional to the perimeter by the same pressure.

==Force==
According to Newtonian mechanics, if the gun and shooter are at rest initially, the force on the bullet will be equal to that on the gun-shooter. This is due to Newton&#x27;s third law of motion (For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction). Consider a system where the gun and shooter have a combined mass g and the bullet has a mass b. When the gun is fired, the two masses move away from one another with velocities g and b respectively. But the law of conservation of momentum states that the magnitudes of their momenta must be equal, and as momentum is a vector quantity and their directions are opposite: 
:formula_1

In technical mathematical terms, the derivative of momentum with respect to time is force, which implies the force on the bullet will equal the force on the gun, and the momentum of the bullet/shooter can be derived via integrating the force-time function of the bullet or shooter. This is mathematically written as follows:

:formula_2
Where formula_3 represent the gun, bullet, time, mass, velocity and force respectively.

Hollywood depictions of firearm victims being thrown through plate-glass windows are inaccurate. Were this the case, the shooter would also be thrown backwards, experiencing an even greater change in momentum in the opposite direction. Gunshot victims frequently fall or collapse when shot; this is less a result of the momentum of the bullet pushing them over, but is primarily caused by physical damage or psychological effects, perhaps combined with being off balance. This is not the case if the victim is hit by heavier projectiles such as 20 mm cannon shell, where the momentum effects can be enormous; this is why very few such weapons can be fired without being mounted on a weapons platform or involve a recoilless system (e.g. a recoilless rifle).

Example:
A .44 Remington Magnum with a jacketed bullet is fired at at a target. What velocity is imparted to the target (assume the bullet remains embedded in the target and thus practically loses all its velocity)?

Let and stand for the mass and velocity of the bullet, the latter just before hitting the target, and let and stand for the mass and velocity of the target after being hit.
Conservation of momentum requires
Solving for the target&#x27;s velocity gives
: = / = 0.016 kg × 360 m/s / 77 kg = 0.07 m/s = 0.17 mph.

This shows the target, with its great mass, barely moves at all. This is despite ignoring drag forces, which would in reality cause the bullet to lose energy and momentum in flight.

==Velocity==
From Eq. 1 we can write for the velocity of the gun/shooter: V = mv/M. This shows that despite the high velocity of the bullet, the small bullet-mass to shooter-mass ratio results in a low recoil velocity (V) although the force and momentum are equal.

==Kinetic energy==
However, the smaller mass of the bullet, compared to that of the gun-shooter system, allows significantly more kinetic energy to be imparted to the bullet than to the shooter. The kinetic energy for the two systems are formula_4 for the gun-shooter system and formula_5 for the bullet. The energy imparted to the shooter can then be written as:

:formula_6

For the ratio of these energies we have:

:formula_7

The ratio of the kinetic energies is the same as the ratio of the masses (and is independent of velocity). Since the mass of the bullet is much less than that of the shooter there is more kinetic energy transferred to the bullet than to the shooter. Once discharged from the weapon, the bullet&#x27;s energy decays throughout its flight, until the remainder is dissipated by colliding with a target (e.g. deforming the bullet and target).

==Transfer of energy==
When the bullet strikes, its high velocity and small frontal cross-section means that it will exert highly focused stresses in any object it hits. This usually results in it penetrating any softer material, such as flesh. The energy is then dissipated along the wound channel formed by the passage of the bullet. See terminal ballistics for a fuller discussion of these effects.

Bulletproof vests work by dissipating the bullet&#x27;s energy in another way; the vest&#x27;s material, usually Aramid (Kevlar or Twaron), works by presenting a series of material layers which catch the bullet and spread its imparted force over a larger area, hopefully bringing it to a stop before it can penetrate into the body behind the vest. While the vest can prevent a bullet from penetrating, the wearer will still be affected by the momentum of the bullet, which can produce contusions.

<text>Līgatne (; ) is a town in Līgatne Parish, Cēsis Municipality in the Vidzeme region of Latvia. It is situated on the Gauja River. The village of Līgatne was built around the paper mill, still extant, on the River Līgatne in the 19th century. Later it grew into a town and was then awarded city status in 1993.

==Līgatne Nature Trails==

The reserve known as the Līgatne Nature Trails is also located here, in the Gauja National Park, in the forest on the left bank of the Gauja River downstream from the paper mill. There are extensive paths through the nature reserve both for walking and for cycling, and there is a separate route for cars. There are also facilities for horse-riding and camping.

The reserve was set up in 1975 for the protection and display of the diversity of species, both plant and animal, which are characteristic of Latvia.

The animals here have been rescued from all over Latvia, either because they were injured, or because they had been tamed and could not survive on their own in the wild. The reserve contains bear, lynx, elk, European bison, roe deer and red deer.

The Gauja river valley contains distinctive geological formations, forests and meadow plants. Particularly significant places are Jumpraviezis rock, Katrīniezis rock, Gūdu cliffs and one of the country&#x27;s rare sandstone canyons: Paparžu grava (&quot;Fern Glen&quot;), known for its ferns.

Līgatne has numerous caves in vertical sandstone banks, that were dug as cellars for paper mill workers during the time of the Russian Empire.

<text>Baguazhang () is one of the three main Chinese martial arts of the &quot;Wudang&quot; school, the other two being tai chi and &quot;xingyiquan&quot;. It is more broadly grouped as an internal practice (or &quot;neijia&quot;). &quot;Baguazhang&quot; literally means &quot;eight trigram palm&quot;, referring to the &quot;bagua&quot; &quot;trigrams&quot; of the &quot;I Ching&quot;, one of the canons of Taoism.

==History==
The creation of &quot;baguazhang&quot; as a formalized martial art is attributed to Dong Haichuan, who is said to have learned it from Taoist and Buddhist masters in the mountains of rural China during the early 19th century. Many Chinese authorities do not accept the Buddhist origin, instead maintaining that those teachers were purely Taoist in origin, the evidence lying in &quot;baguazhang&quot;&#x27;s frequent reference to core concepts central to Taoism, such as yin and yang theory, &quot;I Ching&quot;, and Taoism&#x27;s most distinctive paradigm, the &quot;bagua&quot; diagram. The attribution to Buddhist teachers came from the second generation teachers, i.e. Dong Haichuan&#x27;s students, some of whom were Buddhist. There is evidence to suggest a synthesis of several pre-existing martial arts taught and practised in the region in which Dong Haichuan lived, combined with Taoist circle walking that emulates the cyclical patterns found in nature. Through his work as a servant in the Imperial Palace he impressed the emperor with his graceful movements and fighting skill, and became an instructor and a bodyguard to the court. Dong Haichuan taught for many years in Beijing, eventually earning patronage by the Imperial court.

Famous disciples of Dong Haichuan to become teachers were Yin Fu, Cheng Tinghua, Ma Gui, Song Changrong (), , Ma Weiqi (), Liu Baozhen (), Liang Zhenpu, and Liu Dekuan (). Although they were all students of the same teacher, their methods of training and expressions of palm techniques differed. The Cheng and Liu styles are said to specialize in &quot;pushing&quot; the palms, Yin style is known for &quot;threading&quot; the palms, Song&#x27;s followers practice &quot;Plum Flower&quot; ( &quot;Mei Hua&quot;) palm technique and Ma style palms are known as &quot;hammers&quot;. Some of Dong Haichuan&#x27;s students, including Cheng Tinghua, participated in the Boxer Rebellion. In general, most &quot;baguazhang&quot; exponents today practice either the Yin (), Cheng (), Liang () styles, although Fan (), Shi (), Liu (), Fu (), and other styles also exist (the Liu-style is a special case, in that it is rarely practiced alone, but as a complement to other styles). In addition, there are sub-styles of the above methods as well, such as the Sun (), Gao (), and Jiang () styles, which are sub-styles of Cheng method.

===Common aspects===
The practice of circle walking, or &quot;turning the circle&quot;, as it is sometimes called, is &quot;baguazhang&quot;&#x27;s characteristic method of stance and movement training. All forms of &quot;baguazhang&quot; utilize circle walking as an integral part of training. Practitioners walk around the edge of the circle in various low stances, facing the center, and periodically change direction as they execute forms. For a beginner, the circle is six to twelve feet in diameter. Students first learn flexibility and proper body alignment through the basic exercises, then move on to more complex forms and internal power mechanics. Although the internal aspects of &quot;baguazhang&quot; are similar to those of &quot;xingyiquan&quot; and tai chi, they are distinct in nature.

Many distinctive styles of weapons are contained within &quot;baguazhang&quot;; some use concealment, like the &quot;judge&#x27;s pen&quot; () or a pair of knives (the most elaborate, which are unique to the style, are the crescent-shaped deer horn knives (). &quot;Baguazhang&quot; is also known for practicing with extremely large weapons, such as the &quot;bagua&quot; sword () and the &quot;bagua&quot; broadsword (). Other weapons are also used, such as the staff (&quot;gun&quot;), spear (&quot;qiang&quot;), cane (&quot;guai&quot;), and hook sword (&quot;gou&quot;). Baguazhang practitioners are known for being able to use anything as a weapon using the principles of their art.

&quot;Baguazhang&quot; contains an extremely wide variety of techniques as well as weapons, including various strikes (with palm, fist, elbow, fingers, etc.), kicks, joint locks, throws, and distinctively evasive circular footwork. As such, &quot;baguazhang&quot; is considered neither a purely striking nor a purely grappling martial art. &quot;Baguazhang&quot; emphasizes circular movement, allowing practitioners to flow, harmonize and evade objects and opponents. This is the source of the theory of being able to deal with multiple attackers and find solutions to seemingly complicated scenarios, within training or in daily life. &quot;Baguazhang&quot;&#x27;s evasive nature is also shown by the practice of moving behind an attacker, so that the opponent cannot harm the practitioner.

Although the many branches of &quot;baguazhang&quot; are often quite different from each other (some, like Cheng-style, specialize in close-in wrestling and joint locks, while others, like some of the Yin styles, specialize in quick, long-range striking), all have circle walking, spiraling movement, and certain methods and techniques (piercing palms, crashing palms, etc.) in common.

&quot;Baguazhang&quot;&#x27;s movements employ the whole body with smooth coiling and uncoiling actions, utilizing hand techniques, dynamic footwork, and throws. Rapid-fire movements draw energy from the center of the abdomen or dantian. The circular stepping pattern also builds up centripetal force, allowing the practitioner to maneuver quickly around an opponent.

==In media==

* &quot;Baguazhang&quot; inspired the main basis of airbending in the 2005–2008 Nickelodeon Animation Studio TV series &quot;&quot;, M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s 2010 film counterpart, its , and its sequel series &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;.
* &quot;Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; features &quot;baguazhang&quot; being used by Ying Li, mother of the title character and wife of Wenwu (the MCU&#x27;s version of the Mandarin).
* &quot;Baguazhang&quot; is used by Zhang Ziyi as Gong Ruo Mei and Zhang Jin as Ma San in &quot;The Grandmaster&quot;. 
* Jet Li uses &quot;baguazhang&quot; when playing Gabriel Yulaw in &quot;The One&quot;.
* &quot;Baguazhang&quot; inspired the Hyuga clan&#x27;s gentle fist-fighting style in &quot;Naruto&quot;.
* Ling Xiaoyu of the &quot;Tekken&quot; series of games is said to practice &quot;Baguazhang&quot; and &quot;Piguazhang&quot; styles.
* Ashrah uses a variation of &quot;baguazhang&quot; in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;.

<doc id="212007" wikidata="Q2707611" url="?curid=212007" title="USS Astoria (CA-34)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Astoria&quot; (CL/CA-34) was a of the United States Navy that participated in both the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, but was then sunk in August 1942, at the Battle of Savo Island. &quot;Astoria&quot; was the first &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruiser to be laid down but launched after and received a hull number higher than the lead ship .

Immediately after the months-long Guadalcanal campaign ended in February 1943, the remaining ships of the class would go through major overhauls to lessen top-heaviness due to new electrical and radar systems and advanced anti-aircraft weaponry. In doing so the ships took on a new appearance, most notably in the bridge.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Astoria&quot; was laid down on 1 September 1930, at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch calibre main guns may be referred to as &quot;treaty cruisers.&quot; Originally classified a light cruiser, because of her thin armor, she was reclassified, after being laid down, a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns. The term &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930. Launched on 16 December 1933, sponsored by Miss Leila C. McKay (a descendant of Alexander McKay, a member of the John Jacob Astor expedition that founded Astoria, Oregon), and commissioned on 28 April 1934, Captain Edmund S. Root in command.

During the summer of 1934, &quot;Astoria&quot; conducted a lengthy shakedown cruise, in the course of which she voyaged extensively in the Pacific. In addition to the Hawaiian Islands, the heavy cruiser also visited American Samoa; Fiji; Sydney, Australia; and Nouméa on the island of New Caledonia. She returned to San Francisco on 26 September 1934.

==Inter-war period==
Between the fall of 1934 and February 1937, she operated as a unit of Cruiser Division 7 (CruDiv 7), Scouting Force, based at San Pedro, California. In February 1937, the warship was reassigned to CruDiv 6, though she continued to serve as an element of Scouting Force based at San Pedro. In both assignments, she carried out normal peacetime maneuvers, the culmination of which came in the annual fleet problem that brought the entire United States Fleet together in a single, vast exercise.

===Special duty: Hiroshi Saito&#x27;s ashes===
At the beginning of 1939, Fleet Problem XX concentrated the fleet in the West Indies, and at its conclusion &quot;Astoria&quot;, Richmond Kelly Turner commanding, made a hasty departure from Culebra Island on 3 March 1939 and headed for Chesapeake Bay. After taking on a capacity load of stores and fuel at Norfolk, Virginia, the heavy cruiser proceeded north to Annapolis, Maryland, where she embarked the remains of the former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, the late Hiroshi Saito, for the voyage to Japan, a gesture that expressed America&#x27;s gratitude to the Japanese for returning the body of the late United States Ambassador to Japan, Edgar Bancroft, in the cruiser in 1926. &quot;Astoria&quot; sailed from Annapolis on 18 March 1939, accompanied by Naokichi Kitazawa, Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Washington.

Arriving in the Panama Canal Zone soon thereafter, where &quot;various high officials and a delegation from the Japanese colony in Panama paid their respects to Saito&#x27;s ashes,&quot; &quot;Astoria&quot; got underway for Hawaii on 24 March. She moored at Honolulu on 4 April, the same day that Madame Saito and her two daughters arrived on board the passenger liner . Two days later, the heavy cruiser proceeded westward across the Pacific.

Accompanied by the destroyers , , , &quot;Astoria&quot; steamed slowly into Yokohama harbor on 17 April, United States ensign at half-mast and the Japanese flag at the fore. The warship fired a 21-gun salute which was returned by the light cruiser . American sailors carried the ceremonial urn ashore that afternoon, and funeral ceremonies took place the following morning.

After the solemn state funeral, the Japanese showered lavish hospitality on the visiting cruiser and her men. Captain Turner, for his part, pleased Ambassador to Japan Joseph C. Grew by his diplomatic role in the proceedings; the naval attaché in Tokyo, Captain Harold Medberry Bemis, later recorded that the choice of Turner for that delicate mission was &quot;particularly fortunate...&quot; In grateful appreciation of American sympathy and courtesy a pagoda was later presented by Hirosi Saito&#x27;s wife and child. That pagoda is located in front of Luce Hall at the United States Naval Academy.

&quot;Astoria&quot; sailed for Shanghai, China, on 26 April, and reached her destination on the morning of the 29th. She remained at Shanghai until 1 May. After receiving Admiral Harry E. Yarnell, Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, on board for a courtesy call that morning, &quot;Astoria&quot; put to sea for Hong Kong in the afternoon. Following the visit to Hong Kong, &quot;Astoria&quot; stopped briefly in the Philippines before continuing on to Guam. When she arrived at Guam early on the morning of 21 May, the heavy cruiser was called upon to assist and in their successful effort to refloat the grounded Army transport . Soon thereafter, &quot;Astoria&quot; joined the search for the noted author and adventurer Richard Halliburton, and the companions with whom he had attempted the voyage from Hong Kong to San Francisco in his Chinese junk, &quot;Sea Dragon&quot;. The cruiser combed more than of the Pacific, without success, before she discontinued the search on 29 May.

===Reassigned to Pearl Harbor===
Assigned to the Hawaiian Detachment in October 1939, &quot;Astoria&quot; changed home ports from San Pedro to Pearl Harbor. The following spring, she participated in Fleet Problem XXI, the last of those major annual exercises that brought the entire United States Fleet together to be conducted before World War II engulfed the United States. The maneuvers took place in Hawaiian waters, and, instead of returning to the west coast at their conclusion, the bulk of the fleet joined &quot;Astoria&quot; and the Hawaiian Detachment in making Pearl Harbor its base of operations.

On 2 April 1941, &quot;Astoria&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for the west coast of the United States. She reached Long Beach, California, on 8 April and entered the Mare Island Navy Yard on the 13th. During her refit, she received quadruple-mount /75 cal anti-aircraft guns and a pedestal fitted at her foremast in anticipation of the imminent installation of the new air-search radar. Emerging from the yard on 11 July 1941, the heavy cruiser sailed for Long Beach on the 16th. Later shifting to San Pedro, &quot;Astoria&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor on 24 July 1941.

Following her return to Hawaii on 31 July, &quot;Astoria&quot; operated between Oahu and Midway through early September. That autumn, the specter of German raiders on the prowl in the Pacific prompted the Navy to convoy its ships bound for Guam and the Philippines. &quot;Astoria&quot; escorted to Manila and thence to Guam, before returning to Pearl Harbor on 29 October. Local patrols and training, alternated with upkeep in port, occupied &quot;Astoria&quot; during the final five weeks of peace.

==World War II==
After rising tensions in the Pacific intensified his concern over the defenses of his outlying bases at the beginning of December 1941, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet/United States Fleet, ordered reinforcements, in the form of Marine Corps planes, to be ferried to Wake Island and Midway. &quot;Astoria&quot; put to sea on 5 December in the screen of Rear Admiral John H. Newton&#x27;s Task Force 12 (TF 12) built around . Once the task force reached open sea, &quot;Lexington&quot;″s air group and the 18 Vought SB2U-3 Vindicators from Marine Scout Bombing Squadron 231 (VMSB-231) bound for Midway landed on the carrier&#x27;s flight deck.

When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December, &quot;Astoria&quot; was some west of Hawaii steaming toward Midway with TF 12. At 0900 the following day, the heavy cruiser , flagship of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Commander, Scouting Force, joined up with TF 12, and Brown assumed command. Its ferry mission canceled, TF 12 spent the next few days searching an area to the southwest of Oahu, &quot;with instructions to intercept and destroy any enemy ship in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor...&quot;

The cruiser reentered Pearl Harbor with the &quot;Lexington&quot; force on 13 December, but she returned to sea on the 16th to rendezvous with and screen a convoy, the oiler and the seaplane tender – the abortive Wake Island relief expedition. When that island fell to the Japanese on 23 December, however, the force was recalled. &quot;Astoria&quot; remained at sea until the afternoon of 29 December, when she arrived back at Oahu. When &quot;Astoria&quot; was moored in Pearl Harbor, she had about 40 sailors from the battleship transferred to her ranks. They were survivors of 7 December, when &quot;California&quot; was sunk at Berth F4 on Battleship Row.

&quot;Astoria&quot; departed Pearl Harbor again on the morning of 31 December with TF 11, formed around , and remained at sea into the second week of January 1942. On 11 January, the Japanese submarine &quot;I-6&quot; torpedoed the carrier, forcing her retirement to Pearl Harbor. &quot;Astoria&quot; and her colleagues in the task force saw the crippled carrier safely into port on the morning of 13 January 1942.

After a brief respite at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Astoria&quot; returned to sea on 19 January with TF 11 – the carrier &quot;Lexington&quot;, escorted by heavy cruisers and , and nine destroyers – to &quot;conduct an offensive patrol northeast of the Kingman Reef-Christmas Island line.&quot; On the afternoon of the 21st, however, TF 11 received orders to rendezvous with &quot;Neches&quot;, and then to conduct an air raid on Wake Island, followed by a surface bombardment &quot;if practicable.&quot; Dispatches intercepted on the 23rd, however, revealed that &quot;Neches&quot; had fallen victim to a Japanese submarine, identified later as . Without the oiler&#x27;s precious cargo of fuel, TF 11 could not execute the planned strike. Ordered back to Oahu, the task force reentered Pearl Harbor on the morning of 24 January.

===Southwestern Pacific cruise: TF 17 (USS &quot;Yorktown&quot;)===
On 16 February, &quot;Astoria&quot; put back to sea for what proved to be an extended cruise in the southwestern Pacific with TF 17, built around the carrier and comprising the heavy cruiser , destroyers , , and , and the oiler , all under the command of Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher. Initially, TF 17&#x27;s orders called for operations in the vicinity of Canton Island. However, after the Japanese discovered TF 11 on its way to attack their important new base at Rabaul and sent a determined raid which hit the &quot;Lexington&quot; task force off Bougainville on 20 February, Vice Admiral Brown asked for a second carrier to strengthen his force for another crack at Rabaul. Accordingly, TF 17 received orders to aid Brown in that attempt, and &quot;Astoria&quot; steamed with &quot;Yorktown&quot; to a rendezvous with TF 11 that took place southwest of the New Hebrides on 6 March.

The combined force, under Brown, stood toward Rabaul until the Japanese landings at Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea prompted a change of plans. Late on 8 March, Brown and his staff decided to shift objectives and attack the two new enemy beachheads by launching planes from the Gulf of Papua in the south and sending them across the width of New Guinea to the targets on the northern coast. &quot;Astoria&quot;, meanwhile, joined a surface force made up of heavy cruisers &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Louisville&quot;, and , and destroyers &quot;Anderson&quot;, &quot;Hammann&quot;, , and &quot;Sims&quot; under the command of Rear Admiral John G. Crace, that Brown detached to operate in the waters off Rossel Island in the Louisiade Archipelago. The heavy cruiser and the other warships of that force carried out a threefold mission. They secured the carriers&#x27; right flank during their operations in the Gulf of Papua; they shielded Port Moresby from any new enemy thrust; and they covered the arrival of Army troops at Nouméa.

The raids on Lae and Salamaua, conducted by 104 planes from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; on 10 March 1942 proved devastating to the Japanese, causing heavy damage to their already depleted amphibious forces by sinking three transports and a minesweeper, as well as damaging a light cruiser, a large minelayer, three destroyers and a seaplane carrier. More importantly, the attack delayed the Japanese timetable for conquest in the Solomons and prompted them to send aircraft carriers to cover the operation. The delay, which also allowed the United States Navy time to marshal its forces, coupled with the dispatch of Japanese carriers led to the confrontation in the Coral Sea.

===Battle of the Coral Sea===
&quot;Astoria&quot; rejoined TF 17 on 14 March and patrolled the Coral Sea for the rest of March. At sea continuously since 16 February, &quot;Astoria&quot; began to run low on provisions, so Rear Admiral Fletcher detached her to replenish from at Nouméa along with , &quot;Hughes&quot; and &quot;Walke&quot;. Arriving on 1 April, the cruiser remained there only briefly, returning to sea the following day. The warship marched and counter-marched across the Coral Sea for two weeks before TF 17 headed for Tongatapu, where she and the &quot;Yorktown&quot; force spent the week of 20–27 April.

About this time, intelligence reports convinced Admiral Chester Nimitz that the enemy sought to take Port Moresby, on the southeastern coast of New Guinea, and he resolved to thwart those designs. He sent TF 11, built around a refurbished &quot;Lexington&quot; and led by a new commander, Rear Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch, to join Fletcher&#x27;s TF 17 in the Coral Sea. &quot;Astoria&quot; returned to sea with TF 17 on 27 April to rendezvous with TF 11. The two carrier task forces met in the eastern Coral Sea early on the morning of 1 May.

Late in the afternoon of 3 May, Rear Admiral Fletcher received word of the Japanese occupation of Tulagi in the Solomons. &quot;Astoria&quot; screened &quot;Yorktown&quot; the following day as the carrier launched three raids on the enemy ships off Tulagi. Admiral Fletcher first considered sending &quot;Astoria&quot; and to finish off the crippled ships at Tulagi with surface gunnery, but demurred and kept his force concentrated in anticipation of further action.

Next came a two-day lull on 5–6 May, during which TF 17 fueled in preparation for the impending battle. &quot;Astoria&quot; screened &quot;Yorktown&quot; on the 7th as her planes joined those from &quot;Lexington&quot; in searches and strikes that located and sank the Japanese carrier . Japanese planes, however, located and sank the oiler and her escort, &quot;Sims&quot;.

Fletcher&#x27;s carriers launched aircraft again early on the morning of 8 May, while &quot;Astoria&quot; and the other units of the screen prepared their antiaircraft batteries to meet the retaliation expected from Japanese carriers and . Enemy planes found TF 17 just before 1100 that morning and quickly charged to the attack. Almost simultaneously, planes from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; deployed to attack the enemy task force.

The Japanese aviators concentrated almost exclusively on the American carriers as the two drew apart with their respective screening ships, ultimately putting some of ocean between them by the end of the battle. Torpedo bombers opened the first phase of the attack, while torpedo and dive bombers coordinated attacks in the second phase.

The battle action on 8 May, as &quot;Astoria&quot;″s executive officer, Commander Chauncey R. Crutcher, recounted, &quot;was short and was accompanied by intense anti-aircraft fire against a determined enemy...&quot; &quot;Astoria&quot; assisted in putting up a protective barrage over &quot;Lexington&quot; at the outset, and after the task forces separated, she shifted to the anti-aircraft umbrella over &quot;Yorktown&quot;. Her gunners claimed to have splashed at least four enemy planes in the attack that &quot;seemed to end as suddenly as it had started.&quot;

At about 1245, &quot;Lexington&quot; – heavily damaged though apparently in satisfactory condition afloat and underway – suffered severe internal explosions that rang her death knell. Fires raged out of control and, by 1630, her engines stopped. Ninety minutes later, Captain Frederick C. Sherman ordered the ship abandoned. Once rescue operations were completed, and &quot;Lexington&quot;″s end was hastened by torpedoes from , TF 17 began a slow retirement from the Coral Sea, having suffered heavy losses but also having inflicted a decisive strategic defeat on the Japanese by barring the Port Moresby invasion.

&quot;Astoria&quot; set course for Nouméa along with &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, , &quot;Anderson&quot;, &quot;Hammann&quot;, , and . That force reached its destination on 12 May but remained only overnight. On the 13th, she and the other warships got underway for Pearl Harbor, via Tongatapu, and arrived at Oahu on 27 May.

===Battle of Midway===
The heavy cruiser remained in Pearl Harbor only until the 30th. On that day, she returned to sea with the hastily repaired &quot;Yorktown&quot; to prepare to meet yet another major thrust by the Japanese fleet – this one aimed at Midway. Air searches from that island spotted the enemy&#x27;s Midway Occupation Force – made up of transports, minesweepers, and two seaplane carriers – early on 3 June, but the enemy carrier force eluded detection until early in the morning of the 4th. The heavy cruiser screened &quot;Yorktown&quot; as the carrier began launching strike aircraft at about 0840. While the planes droned off to make their contribution to the destruction of the Japanese carrier force, &quot;Astoria&quot; and her colleagues prepared for the inevitable Japanese reply.

The counterstroke, however, did not come until a few minutes before noon as &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s victorious aviators began to return to their ship. 18 Aichi D3A1 &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers came in to attack the carrier. Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from Fighting Squadron 3 (VF-3) accounted for 10 of the intruders, but the remaining eight managed to penetrate the combat air patrol (CAP). &quot;Astoria&quot; teamed up with &quot;Portland&quot; and the screening destroyers to splash another two of the attackers. The remaining six, however, succeeded in attacking &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and three of those scored hits. One of the three hit the carrier&#x27;s stack, causing fires in her uptakes that literally smoked Rear Admiral Fletcher and his staff out of flag plot. At about 1310, he shifted his flag to &quot;Astoria&quot;.

&quot;Yorktown&quot;″s damage control parties worked feverishly, and by 1340 she was again underway under her own power, albeit at only . At about 1430, the second attack – composed of 10 Nakajima B5N2 &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers escorted by six Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters – came in and eluded the weak CAP. &quot;Astoria&quot; and the other ships of the screen attempted to discourage attacks from four different directions by bringing every gun to bear and firing them into the sea to throw curtains of water into the path of the attackers. Nevertheless, four of the &quot;Kates&quot; made good their attack and released their torpedoes within . &quot;Yorktown&quot; dodged two, but the other two scored hits which stopped the ship again. By 1500, the order to abandon ship went out. &quot;Astoria&quot; called away lifeboats to assist in the rescue of &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s survivors. That night, the heavy cruiser retired east ward with the rest of the task force to await dawn, while a single destroyer, &quot;Hughes&quot;, stood by the stricken carrier.

The following day broke with &quot;Yorktown&quot; still afloat, and efforts began to salvage the battered warship. Though the Japanese had abandoned the Midway attack and had begun retiring toward Japan, submarine had been given orders to sink &quot;Yorktown&quot;. After a 24-hour search, the enemy submarine found her quarry on the 6th and attacked with a spread of four torpedoes. One torpedo missed completely, two passed under destroyer &quot;Hammann&quot; alongside the carrier and detonated in &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s hull, while the fourth broke &quot;Hammann&quot;″s back. The destroyer sank in less than four minutes. The carrier remained afloat until early on the morning of the 7th. At about dawn, she finally rolled over and sank.

&quot;Astoria&quot; remained as flagship for TF 17, as it operated north of Midway, until shortly after midday on 8 June when TF 11 arrived on the scene, and Rear Admiral Fletcher transferred his flag to &quot;Saratoga&quot;, On 11 June, Admiral Nimitz – satisfied that the major Japanese thrust had been thwarted – ordered his carrier task forces back to Hawaii, and &quot;Astoria&quot; reentered Pearl Harbor with them on 13 June. During the early summer of 1942, she completed repairs and alterations at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard and carried out training in the Hawaiian operating area.

===The Solomons (Battle of Savo Island)===

By the beginning of August, &quot;Astoria&quot; had been reassigned to Task Group 62.3 (TG 62.3), Fire Support Group L, to cover the Guadalcanal-Tulagi landings. Early on the morning of 7 August, the heavy cruiser entered the waters between Guadalcanal and Florida Islands in the southern Solomons. Throughout the day, she supported the Marines as they landed on Guadalcanal and several smaller islands nearby. The Japanese launched air counterattacks on the 7th–8th, and &quot;Astoria&quot; helped to defend the transports from those attacks.

On the night of 8/9 August, a Japanese force of seven cruisers and a destroyer under Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa sneaked by Savo Island and attacked the American ships. At the time, &quot;Astoria&quot; had been patrolling to the east of Savo Island in column behind and . The Japanese came through the channel to the west of Savo Island and opened fire on &quot;Chicago&quot; – force first at about 0140 on the morning of the 9th, hitting both cruisers with torpedoes and shells. They then divided – inadvertently – into two separate groups and turned generally northeast, passing on either side of &quot;Astoria&quot; and her two consorts. The enemy cruisers began firing on that force at about 0150, and the heavy cruiser began return fire immediately. She ceased fire briefly because her commanding officer temporarily mistook the Japanese force for friendly ships but soon resumed shooting. &quot;Astoria&quot; took no hits in the first four Japanese salvoes, but the fifth ripped into her superstructure, turning her into an inferno amidships. In quick succession, enemy shells put her No. 1 turret out of action and started a serious fire in the plane hangar that burned brightly and provided the enemy with a self-illuminated target.

From that moment on, deadly accurate Japanese gunfire pounded her unmercifully, and she began to lose speed. Turning to the right to avoid &quot;Quincy&quot;″s fire at about 0201, &quot;Astoria&quot; reeled as a succession of enemy shells struck her aft of the foremast. Soon thereafter, &quot;Quincy&quot; veered across &quot;Astoria&quot;″s bow, blazing fiercely from bow to stern. &quot;Astoria&quot; put her rudder over hard left and avoided a collision while her battered sister ship passed aft, to starboard. As the warship turned, ″s searchlight illuminated her, and men on deck passed the order to No. 2 turret to shoot out the offending light. When the turret responded with &quot;Astoria&quot;″s 12th and final salvo, the shells missed &quot;Kinugasa&quot; but struck the No. 1 turret of .

&quot;Astoria&quot; lost steering control on the bridge at about 0225, shifted control to central station, and began steering a zig-zag course south. Before she made much progress, though, the heavy cruiser lost all power. Fortunately, the Japanese chose that exact instant to withdraw. By 0300, nearly 400 men, including about 70 wounded and many dead, were assembled on the forecastle deck.

Suffering from the effects of at least 65 hits, &quot;Astoria&quot; fought for her life. A bucket brigade battled the blaze on the gun deck and the starboard passage forward from that deck, and the wounded were moved to the captain&#x27;s cabin, where doctors and corpsmen proceeded with their care. Eventually, however, the deck beneath grew hot and forced the wounded back to the forecastle. The bucket brigade made steady headway, driving the fire aft on the starboard side of the gun deck, while a gasoline handy-billy rigged over the side pumped a small stream into the wardroom passage below.

 came alongside &quot;Astoria&quot;″s starboard bow and, by 0445, took all of the wounded off the heavy cruiser&#x27;s forecastle. At that point, a small light flashed from &quot;Astoria&quot;″s stern, indicating survivors on that part of the ship. Signaling the men on the heavy cruiser&#x27;s stern that they had been seen, &quot;Bagley&quot; got underway and rescued men on rafts – some &quot;Vincennes&quot; survivors – and men who had been driven overboard by the fires blazing aboard &quot;Astoria&quot;.

With daylight, &quot;Bagley&quot; returned to the heavy cruiser and came alongside her starboard quarter. Since it appeared that the ship could be saved, a salvage crew of about 325 able-bodied men went back aboard &quot;Astoria&quot;. Another bucket brigade attacked the fires while the ship&#x27;s first lieutenant investigated all accessible lower decks. A party of men collected the dead and prepared them for burial. came up to assist in the salvage effort at about 0700. After securing a towline, &quot;Hopkins&quot; proceeded ahead, swinging &quot;Astoria&quot; around in an effort to tow her to the shallow water off Guadalcanal. A second gasoline-powered handy-billy, transferred from &quot;Hopkins&quot;, promptly joined the struggle against the fires. soon arrived on the scene, coming alongside the cruiser at about 0900 to pump water into the fire forward. Called away at 1000, &quot;Hopkins&quot; and &quot;Wilson&quot; departed, but the heavy cruiser received word that was on the way to assist in battling the fires and that was coming to tow the ship.

====Sinking====
Nevertheless, the fire below decks increased steadily in intensity, and those topside could hear explosions. Her list increased, first to 10° and then 15°. Her stern lowered in the dark waters, and her bow was distinctly rising. All attempts to shore the shell holes – by then below the waterline due to the increasing list – proved ineffective, and the list increased still more. &quot;Buchanan&quot; arrived at 11:30, but could not approach due to the heavy port list. Directed to stand off the starboard quarter, she stood by while all hands assembled on the stern, which was now wet with seawater. With the port waterway awash at noon, Commodore William G. Greenman gave the order to abandon ship.

&quot;Astoria&quot; turned over on her port beam, rolled slowly, and settled by the stern, disappearing completely by 12:16. &quot;Buchanan&quot; lowered two motor whaleboats and, although interrupted by a fruitless hunt for a submarine, came back and assisted the men in the water. &quot;Alchiba&quot;, which arrived on the scene just before &quot;Astoria&quot; sank, rescued 32 men. Not one man from the salvage crew lost his life. Officially, 219 men were reported missing or killed.

==Rediscovery==
The wreck of USS &quot;Astoria&quot; was discovered in early 2015 during a sonar mapping project of Iron Bottom Sound led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The wreck lies upright in roughly of water with its bow missing and &quot;A&quot; turret pointing aft.

<text>The forest raven (Corvus tasmanicus), also commonly known as the Tasmanian raven, is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae native to Tasmania and parts of southern Victoria, such as Wilsons Promontory and Portland. Populations are also found in parts of New South Wales, including Dorrigo and Armidale. Measuring in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and legs. As with the other two species of raven in Australia, its black feathers have grey bases. Adults have white irises; younger birds have dark brown and then hazel irises with an inner blue rim. New South Wales populations are recognised as a separate subspecies &quot;C. tasmanicus boreus&quot;, but appear to be nested within the Tasmanian subspecies genetically.

The forest raven lives in a wide variety of habitats in Tasmania but is restricted to more closed forest on mainland Australia. Breeding takes place in spring and summer, occurring later in Tasmania than in New South Wales. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, the forest raven eats a wide variety of plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas and roadkill. It has been blamed for killing lambs and poultry and raiding orchards in Tasmania, and is unprotected under Tasmanian legislation. The forest raven is sedentary, with pairs generally bonding for life and establishing permanent territories.

==Taxonomy and naming==
John Latham described the &quot;South-Seas raven&quot; in 1781, with loose throat feathers and found in &quot;the Friendly Isles&quot; in the South Seas, but did not give a binomial name. Although &quot;the Friendly Isles&quot; refers to Tonga, the specimen resembles what is now known as the forest raven and was collected by ships&#x27; surgeon William Anderson on the third voyage of James Cook in January 1777. Of the species, he had written, &quot;Crows, nearly the same as ours in England&quot;. Tasked as the expedition&#x27;s naturalist, Anderson collected many bird specimens but had died of tuberculosis in 1778 before the return home. Many collection localities were incorrect, and notes were lost or pieced together many years later. German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin gave the species the name &quot;Corvus australis&quot; in the 13th edition of &quot;Systema naturae&quot; in 1788.

Since Australia was settled by Europeans, all species of crows and ravens have been colloquially known as crows by the general population and are difficult to distinguish. In his 1865 &quot;Handbook to the Birds of Australia&quot; John Gould noted a single species of corvid in Australia, &quot;Corvus australis&quot;, which he called the white-eyed crow. He used Gmelin&#x27;s 1788 name, which took precedence by virtue of its age over Vigors and Horsfield&#x27;s description. In 1912 Scottish naturalist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant clarified the species as &quot;C. coronoides&quot; (raven, and incorporating little and Australian ravens) and &quot;C. cecilae&quot; (Torresian crow). Subsequently, French-American ornithologist Charles Vaurie acted as First Revisor under Article 24 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) Code and discarded &quot;C. australis&quot; as a junior homonymin 1788 Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the black nunbirdto preserve the stability of the name. This has been followed by later authors.

Gregory Mathews described the forest raven as a distinct subspecies (&quot;Corvus marianae tasmanicus&quot;) of the Australian raven in 1912, its species name derived from Tasmania, the type locality. Ian Rowley raised the forest raven to species rank in 1970, noting there were no intermediate forms between it and the little raven (its closest relative) and that it was clearly larger with a much more massive bill. He described a second subspecies (&quot;Corvus tasmanicus boreus&quot;) the same year, observing that &quot;C. tasmanicus&quot; from Tasmania and southern Victoria has a very short tail compared with individuals from the northern New South Wales population. The term &quot;crow&quot; is colloquially applied to any or all species of Australian corvid. In 1970 Rowley gave the species name &quot;forest raven&quot;, which was later designated the official name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC).

Preliminary genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another, and that the two lineages are not closely related. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the forest raven may be conspecificity with the Australian raven. Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 clarified that the forest and little raven are each other&#x27;s closest relative. The northern subspecies &quot;boreus&quot; turned out to be nested in the Tasmanian &quot;tasmanicus&quot;, indicating the populations separated very recently. It is still recognised as a distinct subspecies by the International Ornithological Committee.

Ian Rowley proposed that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north. The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens in the east and Australian raven in the west. As the climate was cooler and drier, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely as the habitat between became inhospitable. Furthermore, the eastern diverged into nomadic little ravens and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western ravens spread eastwards and outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia, as evidenced by the forest ravens&#x27; being found only in closed forest refuges on the mainland but in a wider variety of habitats in Tasmania.

==Description==
The largest of the Australian corvids, the adult forest raven is long with a wingspan of and weighing approximately . There is no seasonal variation in plumage, which is entirely glossy black with a blue or green sheen visible on the upperparts. The wings are long and broad, with the largest of its ten primary feathers (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped. It is quite short in Tasmanian populations but longer in northern New South Wales. The beak is a similar shape to that of the little raven, though more massive and heavy-set. The upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles. The mouth and tongue are black, as are the powerful legs and feet. The tibia is fully feathered and the tarsus is long.

Sexes have identical plumage; the male is generally larger, but there is considerable overlap in size between individuals. The forest raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled. The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all. Relative size is useful only when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small. In Tasmania, the forest raven could be confused with the black currawong, though the latter species has more slender wings with white markings, a longer tail and a very different call.

Juveniles (birds up to a year old) have a shorter, shallower bill, which is dark grey with some pink at the base. The gape is pink. The plumage is softer and fluffier and often has a brown tint. It generally lacks the glossy sheen of adult birds, though a blue-purple sheen can be seen sometimes on mantle and shoulders plumage. Birds between one and two years old closely resemble adults but retain juvenile feathers on wings and tail and have smaller bills. Birds between two and three years have adult plumage but lack the adult eye colour. Eye colour varies with age: nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey eyes, juveniles aged from four to fourteen months have brown eyes, and immature birds have hazel eyes with blue eyerings around the pupil until age two years and ten months.

===Vocalization===
The call is considered the most reliable means of identification in areas where the forest raven&#x27;s range overlaps with other corvids. It is a deep and husky &quot;korr-korr-korr-korr&quot; with a similarly drawn out last note to the Australian raven. It can also utter a barking alarm call. The calls of juveniles have a higher pitch than those of adult birds. Mated pairs greet each other with a specific return-home call; a long extended descending call, and characteristic flapping flight with reduced-amplitude wingbeats.

==Distribution and habitat==
The only member of the corvid family that has a permanent population in Tasmania, the forest raven is the most widely distributed bird species in the state. There are three populations in southern Victoria: from the vicinity of Lakes Entrance west across Gippsland to Wilsons Promontory, the Otway Ranges from west of Torquay to Port Campbell, and lastly in the Grampians and Millicent Plain extending into south-east South Australia. Isolated records suggest the latter two populations may actually be continuous. There are two disjunct populations in northern New South Wales. A coastal population is found from Tea Gardens north to Yuraygir National Park, while a more montane population is found along the Great Dividing Range and New England Tableland from Gloucester Tops in the south to Tenterfield in the north. The gap between the two populations is around , shrinking to at Dorrigo.

The forest raven inhabits a wide range of habitat within Tasmania such as woods, open interrupted forest, mountains, coastal areas, farmland and town and city fringes. A survey of Mount Wellington found it to be one of the few birds that remained in open and marshland habitat at higher elevations over the winter. Additionally, research within Tasmania found that ravens were thirty percent more likely to be observed in farmland habitat than in non-agricultural forested or urban areas. On mainland Australia it appears to be more confined to forests: wet and dry sclerophyll forest and cool temperate rainforest, as well as pine plantations in Victoria. Populations in Victoria and New South Wales are possibly expanding, with the species more evident in towns such as Forster-Tuncurry and Port Macquarie, and along segments of the Oxley Highway between Wauchope and Walcha, and Thunderbolts Way between Gloucester and Nowendoc, most likely due to roadkill from increased vehicular traffic. It is unclear whether records since the 1970s in areas where the forest raven was unknown are the result of range expansion or improved field observations and identification.

Forest ravens fly from Tasmania and the mainland to islands well offshore in Bass Strait and may even traverse the strait entirely. First recorded on King Island in Bass Strait in 1979, the forest raven has become more numerous and flocks of several hundred birds were recorded by 1997. The island was previously inhabited by little ravens.

==Behaviour==
Sedentary and territorial, the forest raven is similar in breeding and feeding habits to the Australian raven. A single breeding pair and their brood occupy a territory of variable sizeareas of have been recordedand remains there year-round, though groups of ravens may enter this area to forage. In northern New South Wales, forest ravens have been recorded nesting near Australian ravens and Torresian crows. They were observed warding off the Australian ravens but to a degree permitting the crows to pass through their territories. Forest ravens will defend their territory by chasing and mobbing intruding birds of prey as large as wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles. Agonistic displays to ward off potential intruders include flying to a high perch and calling loudly with head extended and hackles raised. Forest ravens will give their wings a flick on the upward wingbeat when flying to the perch and may continue flicking their wings after landing. Subadult and nonbreeding forest ravens form flocks that move around, though they may use the same roosting site for a few months at a time. Forest ravens generally walk when moving around on the ground, though do hop when hurrying, such as when trying to avoid an oncoming car on a road.

===Breeding===
Forest ravens breed after at least three years and form monogamous pairs. Birds breed later in Tasmania than in mainland Australia, though the species has been little studied. Eggs have been recorded from July to September and nestlings in September and October in New South Wales, while nestlings have been noted from September to December in Victoria. In Tasmania, the breeding season appears to take place from August to January. Forest ravens generally nest in forks in tall trees, usually eucalypts, below the canopy line. They have been recorded as nesting on the ground on some Bass Strait Islands. Breeding success rates were impacted severely by droughts in New South Wales.

The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of twigs lined with available materials such as leaves, wool, grass, bark, feathers, or occasionally horse manure or hair from cattle. The sticks are generally thick. Nests are sometimes renovated from previous years. A clutch can comprise up to six eggs, though usually four or five are laid. Measuring 45 by 31  mm ( ×   in), eggs are green-cream and splotched with brown and grey markings. Eggs are laid every one to two days. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless, naked, and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. Both parents feed the young.

===Feeding===
The forest raven is an omnivore, though it eats more meat than other smaller corvids. Its diet includes a wide range of foods such as insects, carrion, fruit, grain, and earthworms. It has been known to attack and eat birds as large as the little penguin, though many birds and mammals are already dead when encountered. In general a significant proportion of its food appears to come from habitats in or near water. Forest ravens observed on the beach at Wilson&#x27;s Promontory would glean the sand and turn over or disturb pieces of seaweed and debris for insect prey. They have also been reported taking crabs from sandbars and raiding seabird colonies for eggs and young.

Forest ravens forage in pairs or groups of up to ten birds, though they may gather in much larger numbers if there is an abundant food source, such as a large carcass, rubbish, or insect swarm. The species is attracted to areas where people have discarded excess food, such as rubbish tips, picnic grounds, parks, gardens, and roads. Forest ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with Torresian crows, little and Australian ravens. In these situations the more abundant species may exclude the less abundant. In Tasmania, forest ravens have been recorded foraging with Pacific and silver gulls, and black currawongs. Foraging takes place in the early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either find objects while walking along and looking and turn over objects with their bills as they go. Forest ravens often fly above the ground over marshland, heath, or beaches looking for food. Nests of various birds, including domestic chickens and burrowing seabirds, have been raided for eggs and young. Forest ravens have been observed attempting to raid the nest of ospreys on the New South Wales north coast.

The species is often observed scavenging, particularly on roadkill. Across much of Tasmania, forest ravens have benefited from the disease-driven decline of the Tasmanian devil (&quot;Sarcophilus harrisii&quot;) due to greater access to carrion. Additionally, forest ravens appear to scavenge heavily on roadkill throughout the entire year on the Bass Strait islands where mammalian scavengers, like devils and quolls, are now absent. In contrast, forest ravens within Tasmania appear to scavenge heavily on roadkill only during Autumn, when other resources like invertebrates and fruit are sparse.

Forest ravens cache food items for later consumption, generally using trees to evade other scavengers. Field observations in Nambucca showed that they built stick-like platforms in diameter high in the canopies of trees as places to store and eat food. They were recorded storing food in tree forks above the ground and within the folds of the bark of paperbark trees. In another field study, a forest raven stole a cape barren goose egg and hid it in a grassy tussock to consume later.

Alongside Australian ravens, forest ravens have been blamed for damaging orchards and killing lambs and poultry. This is not supported by fieldwork. They most often scavenge for afterbirth and newborn lamb feces, which are highly nutritious. They are thought to have a beneficial role in cleaning up carcasses and consuming insect pests. Forest ravens prey on the larvae of the pasture beetle &quot;Scitala sericans&quot;. The beetle can damage pastures and is an agricultural pest; the raven may uproot plants when digging out the grubs.

===Parasites===
The mite &quot;Knemidocoptes intermedius&quot; has been isolated from the forest raven. Infestation results in crusty grey lesions (knemidocoptiasis) around their tibiotarsal joints (ankles), caused by the mites living in tunnels under the skin. The channel-billed cuckoo (&quot;Scythrops novaehollandiae&quot;) has been recorded as a brood parasite.

== Conservation status ==
Its large range and abundance mean the bird is classified as &quot;least concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List; some decrease has been noted but it is of insufficient size or duration to change classification. The populations of northern New South Wales have been classified as &quot;near threatened&quot; in 2000 by Garnett and Crowley and were estimated at the time to number about 10,000 breeding pairs.

==Relationship with humans==
Like the Australian raven on mainland Australia, the forest raven in Tasmania has a history of being shot or poisonedgenerally by farmers as it is perceived to be a threat to livestock and orchard crops. It is not protected under Tasmania&#x27;s Nature Conservation Act 2002 and no permit is required if landowners seek to kill them. Larger numbers of forest ravens (alongside swamp harriers and brown falcons) were killed in 1958 as rabbit populations dwindled due to myxomatosis and predatory birds were thought to have turned their attention to poultry and livestock. Studies on corvids elsewhere in Australia showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to be attacked, and hence their poor reputation was unjustified. Forest ravens may do more good than harm by preying on insects and removing carrion. Research within Tasmania has found that forest ravens are six times more likely to be observed in areas of high roadkill density compared to areas of no roadkill. Despite their fondness for roadkill, forest ravens are rarely hit by vehicles.

<doc id="212024" wikidata="Q1344715" url="?curid=212024" title="Shugart Associates">
<text>Shugart Associates (later Shugart Corporation) was a computer peripheral manufacturer that dominated the floppy disk drive market in the late 1970s and is famous for introducing the -inch &quot;Minifloppy&quot; floppy disk drive. In 1979 it was one of the first companies to introduce a hard disk drive form factor compatible with a floppy disk drive, the SA1000 form factor compatible with the 8-inch floppy drive form factor.

Founded in 1973, Shugart Associates was purchased in 1977 by Xerox, which then exited the business in 1985 and 1986, selling the brand name and the 8-inch floppy product line (in March 1986) to Narlinger Group, which ultimately ceased operations circa 1991.

==History==
===Beginnings===
After a distinguished career at IBM and a few years at Memorex, Alan Shugart decided to strike out on his own in 1973. After gathering venture capital, he started Shugart Associates. The original business plan was to build a small-business system (similar to the IBM 3740) dealing with the development of various major components, including floppy disk drives and printers. After two years, Shugart had exhausted his startup money and had no product to show for it. The board then wanted to focus on the floppy disk drive, but Shugart wished to continue the original plan. Official company documents state that Shugart quit, but he himself claims that he was fired by the venture capitalists. Shugart went on with Finis Conner to found Shugart Technology in 1979, which was later renamed to Seagate Technology in response to a legal challenge by Xerox.

The -inch floppy disk drive was introduced by Shugart in September 1976 as the Shugart SA-400 Minifloppy (Shugart&#x27;s trademarked brand name) at an OEM price of $390 for the drive and $45 for ten diskettes. The SA-400 and related models became the company&#x27;s best selling products, with shipments of up to 4000 drives per day.

The original SA-400 was single-sided with 35-tracks and used FM (single density) recording. It could be used on either hard- or soft-sector floppy controllers and was specified at 80.6 kB with a soft sectored controller. The drive became the basis of the disk system on the Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I, Apple II, and many other early microcomputers.

===Late 1970s===
Xerox announced acquisition of Shugart Associates in August 1977 and completed its purchase that December at a price of about $41 million.

The 440 kilobyte SA450, a double-sided double-density 5¼-inch full height floppy disk drive was announced in December 1977 at $450.

In 1979, Shugart Associates introduced the &quot;Shugart Associates System Interface&quot; (SASI) to the computing world; the interface subsequently evolved into SCSI (Small Computer System Interface). The first standard process completed in 1986 with ANSI standard &quot;X3.131-1986&quot; (popularly known as &quot;SCSI-1&quot;) as the result. Larry Boucher led the SASI engineering team; he and several of the engineers who worked on SASI left in 1981 to found host adapter maker Adaptec.

Also in 1979, Shugart Associates introduced the SA-1000, a series of hard disk drives that kept as many mechanical, electrical and formatting similarities as possible with its floppy-drive counterparts. Their physical dimensions, including mounting holes, were the same as an 8-inch floppy drive, making them some of the earliest hard drives compatible with a floppy drive form factor. By 1983, Shugart Associates had shipped over 100,000 such drives.

===1980s===
In the early 1980s, in order to avoid development and start-up costs, the company turned to Matsushita Communications Inc., a subsidiary of Panasonic Corporation (then known as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd), for its half-height -inch drives, sending that company on its way to becoming the largest floppy drive manufacturer in the world. In 1985, in order to resolve an inventory accumulation and as part of its exit strategy, Xerox gave up Shugart&#x27;s exclusive rights to the Matsushita half-height -inch floppy drives. Shugart&#x27;s eventual downfall came about partially as a result of the company failing to develop a reliable 80-track disk drive.

In 1983 the company changed its name to Shugart Corporation.

In late 1983, Shugart announced a &quot;production-quantity optical drive&quot;, the Optimem 1000, offering 1 GB of storage on 12-inch disks using a laser-based recording technology, taking advantage of a substantially increased track density compared to contemporary magnetic recording technologies. The process of recording involved focusing the laser beam on the metal layer of the disk, this causing a &quot;decomposable polymer&quot; layer underneath to generate &quot;gaseous components&quot; and to push up on the metal layer, forming a bubble. This deformation would cause a change in the intensity of the reflected light from a laser reading the disk, thus providing a means of data storage. Initial OEM pricing for the drive was given as $6,000 per unit in 250-unit quantities with disks priced about $ each (UK price). Disks with capacities of up to 3 GB were reportedly being developed. Optimem was sold to Cipher Data in 1986 who then discontinued operations in 1991.

Shugart&#x27;s operating losses in 1984 along with Xerox&#x27;s own troubles led Xerox to conclude in 1985 that Shugart businesses were no longer strategically important, resulting in a decision to close down Shugart rather than invest in recovery. 
Most of Shugart&#x27;s businesses were shut down afterwards; however its floppy disk drive business was sold in March 1986 to Narlinger, which promptly rebranded itself as Shugart Corporation 

Under the management of Narlinger, Shugart acquired several discontinued product lines such as Tandon&#x27;s 8-inch floppy drives in 1986 and in 1988 bought the Optotech 5984 Write Once Read Many (WORM) drive and its manufacturing facility for less than US$4-million. In 1987, it acquired Kennedy Company, a maker of tape drives and hard disks, from Allegheny Ludlum. Shugart shortly after sold Kennedy&#x27;s assets to Irwin Magnetic Systems, who promptly folded the Kennedy division while retaining its patents. Shugart themselves ceased operations around 1991.

<text>The Eurasian golden oriole (Oriolus oriolus), also called the common golden oriole, is the only member of the Old World oriole family of passerine birds breeding in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. It is a summer migrant in Europe and Palearctic and spends the winter season in central and southern Africa.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Eurasian golden oriole was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and given the binomial name &quot;Coracias oriolus&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Oriolus&quot; that Linnaeus introduced in 1766.

The Eurasian golden oriole and the Indian golden oriole were formerly considered conspecific, but in 2005 they were treated as separate species by the ornithologists Pamela Rasmussen and John Anderton, in the first edition of their &quot;Birds of South Asia&quot;. Support for this split was provided by a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010, and most ornithologists now treat the Indian golden oriole as a separate species. Alternate names for the Eurasian golden oriole include the European golden oriole and Western Eurasian golden oriole. The species is monotypic.

===Etymology===
The name &quot;oriole&quot; was first used in the 18th century and is an adaptation of the scientific Latin genus name, which is derived from the Classical Latin &quot;aureolus&quot; meaning &quot;golden&quot;. Various forms of &quot;oriole&quot; have existed in Romance languages since the 12th and 13th centuries. Albertus Magnus used the Latin form &quot;oriolus&quot; in about 1250 and erroneously stated that it was onomatopoeic because of the golden oriole&#x27;s song. In medieval England its name, derived from the song, was the &quot;woodwele&quot;.

==Description==
The male is striking in the typical oriole black and yellow plumage, but the female is a drabber green bird. Orioles are shy, and even the male is remarkably difficult to see in the dappled yellow and green leaves of the canopy. In flight they look somewhat like a thrush, strong and direct with some shallow dips over longer distances.

Its call is a harsh &quot;kweeaahk&quot;, but the song is a fluting &quot;weela-wee-ooo&quot; or &quot;or-iii-ole&quot;, unmistakable once heard, often with subtle variations between each phrase.

The male of the Indian golden oriole (&quot;Oriolus kundoo&quot;) has a black eye-stripe extending behind the eye, has a longer and paler red bill and has more yellow in the plumage.

==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding range of this species spans from western Europe and Scandinavia east to China. They winter in central and southern Africa. They generally migrate during the night, but may travel during the day in the spring migration. During the autumn migration they migrate via the Eastern Mediterranean where they feed on fruit; they are often considered a pest in this region because of this. They formerly bred in Great Britain; the last confirmed breeding was in 2009 in East Anglia.

The Eurasian golden oriole inhabits a range of habitats. In Western Europe they prefer open broadleaf forests and plantations, copses, riverine forests, orchards, large gardens; in Eastern Europe they may inhabit more continuous forests as well as mixed or coniferous forests. They generally avoid treeless habitats but may forage there. In their wintering habitat they are found in semi-arid to humid woodland, tall forests, riverine forest, woodland/savanna mosaic and savanna.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===
Eurasian golden orioles may delay breeding until they are 2 or 3 years of age. Males usually arrive at breeding area several days before the females. The fidelity to a territory or even to a specific nest site suggests that the pair-bond may continue from one breeding season to the next. The nest is placed high in a tree towards the edge of the crown. The deep cup-shaped nest is suspended below a horizontal fork of thin branches. It is built by the female, but the male will sometimes gather some of the material. The nest is held in place by plant fibres up to in length and lined with fine grass, feathers and wool. The clutch is usually between 3 and 5 eggs. These are laid at daily intervals early in the morning. The eggs are on average with a calculated weight of . They can be white, cream or very pale pink and are decorated with black marks which are sometimes concentrated at the larger end. The eggs are mainly incubated by the female but the male will incubate for short periods to allow the female to feed. The eggs hatch after 16–17 days. The young are fed by both parents but are mostly brooded by the female. The young fledge after 16–17 days. The clutch is only rarely lost to predators as the parents vigorously defend their nest.

The greatest recorded age for a Eurasian golden oriole is 10 years and 1 month for a male that was ringed in Lincolnshire in 1986 and seen alive in Cambridgeshire in 1996.

===Feeding===
They feed on insects and fruit, using their bills to pick insects out of crevices.

== Conservation ==
Golden orioles have an extremely large range with large populations that are apparently stable. Therefore, they are evaluated as least concern by BirdLife International.

<text>Beck&#x27;s Futures was a British art prize founded by London&#x27;s Institute of Contemporary Arts and sponsored by Beck&#x27;s beer given to contemporary artists.

Prior to the establishment of the prize in 2000, Beck&#x27;s had sponsored several exhibitions of contemporary art in Britain by providing free beer. Together with Artangel, they had also commissioned a number of works by artists, including Rachel Whiteread&#x27;s &quot;House&quot; and &quot;Water Tower&quot; and pieces by Douglas Gordon and Tony Oursler.

Although it does not receive as much publicity as the Turner Prize, the prize fund is larger - in 2003, it was £65,000 to the Turner Prize&#x27;s £20,000. Of this, £20,000 went to the winner, who also took a share of the £40,000 divided between all the shortlisted artists. The remaining £5,000 was allocated to the Student Prize for Film and Video, with £2,000 of that going to the winner.

For the first three years of the prize a call for nominations was made to curators and critics around the UK. This proved controversial as unlike the Turner Prize artists knew they had been nominated even if they did not make the final shortlist. The open call was replaced with an anonymous nominations panel.

==Winners==
*2000 - Roderick Buchanan
*2001 - Tim Stoner
*2002 - Toby Paterson
*2003 - Rosalind Nashashibi
*2004 - Saskia Olde Wolbers
*2005 - Christina Mackie
*2006 - Matt Stokes

The 2003 prize, presented by Wim Wenders, was awarded on 29 April at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. As well as Nashashibi, the shortlisted artists were Bernd Behr, Nick Crowe, Alan Currall, Inventory, David Sherry, Lucy Skaer, Francis Upritchard and Carey Young. The panel of judges was chaired by the artist Michael Landy, and also included the curators Russell Ferguson, Maria Lind and Hans Ulrich Obrist.

The 2004 prize was awarded on 27 April to Saskia Olde Wolbers. The other shortlisted artists were Haluk Akakçe, Tonico Lemos Auad, Simon Bedwell, Ergin Çavusoglu, Andrew Cross, Susan Philipsz, Imogen Stidworthy, Hayley Tompkins and Nicoline Van Harskamp.

The 2005 prize, presented by Richard Hamilton, was awarded on 26 April to Christina Mackie. The other shortlisted artists were Lali Chetwynd, Luke Fowler, Ryan Gander, Daria Martin, and Donald Urquhart.

The 2006 prize was awarded to Matt Stokes by a panel made-up of Jake and Dinos Chapman, Martin Creed, Cornelia Parker, Yinka Shonibare and Gillian Wearing. There was also a public vote, the outcome of which was added as an extra vote in the judging panels final count. Shortlisted for the prize were Blood ‘n’ Feathers (Jo Robertson &amp; Lucy Stein), Pablo Bronstein, Stefan Brüggemann, Richard Hughes, Flávia Müller Medeiros, Seb Patane, Olivia Plender, Simon Popper, Jamie Shovlin, Daniel Sinsel, Matt Stokes, Sue Tompkins, Bedwyr Williams. This was to be the Beck&#x27;s sponsored prize&#x27;s last year.

<doc id="212031" wikidata="Q328424" url="?curid=212031" title="John Paul Getty Jr.">
<text>Sir Paul Getty (; born Eugene Paul Getty; 7 September 1932 – 17 April 2003), known widely as John Paul Getty Jr., was a British-American philanthropist and book collector. He was the third of five sons born to J. Paul Getty (1892–1976), one of the richest men in the world at the time. His mother was J. Paul Getty&#x27;s fourth wife, Ann Rork. The Getty family&#x27;s wealth was the result of the oil business founded by George Franklin Getty. One of his sons, Mark Getty, co-founded the visual media company Getty Images.

At birth, he was given the name Eugene Paul Getty, but in later life, he adopted other names, including Paul Getty, John Paul Getty, Jean Paul Getty Jr. and John Paul Getty II. In 1973, his son John Paul Getty III was held captive in Italy, as J. Paul Getty refused to pay a ransom. In 1986, he was awarded an honorary knighthood for services to causes ranging from cricket, to art and to the Conservative Party. His honorary knighthood would eventually become substantive upon the required acquisition of British citizenship. A long-time Anglophile, he became a British citizen in 1997. In 1998, he changed his name by deed poll when he renounced the first name Eugene and wished to be known as Sir Paul Getty KBE.

==Early life==
John Paul Jr. was born on board ship in the waters near Genoa, Italy, on 7 September 1932, while his parents Ann and J. Paul Getty were travelling. His birth was registered at La Spezia with the name Eugenio Paul Getty, when the Italian notary misheard the name John. He would legally alter his name with the Italian authorities to John Paul in 1958.

He was initially raised in Los Angeles, California, United States. His parents&#x27; marriage was troubled by J. Paul&#x27;s long absences abroad and his emotional distance. Ann Getty divorced J. Paul Getty Sr. in 1936 in Reno, Nevada, claiming emotional cruelty and neglect. She was awarded $1,000 per month in child support for each of her sons, Paul Jr. and Gordon.

In 1938, Ann married her third husband, Joseph Stanton McInerney, and the family moved to San Francisco. Paul Jr. attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory and the University of San Francisco, both Jesuit schools. Throughout his adolescence, he showed a great interest in reading and music, encouraged by his mother. In 1950 he was drafted to serve in the Korean War, spending the duration working at the American headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. After he was discharged he met Abigail Harris, the daughter of a prominent San Franciscan federal judge, and the two were married in early 1956. His first child, John Paul Getty III was born in November 1956. The following year he approached his brother Gordon, vice-president of the Getty subsidiary Tidewater Petroleum, asking for a job. His brother gave him a job pumping gas at a Tidewater gas station in Marin County. After a year, his father, whom he had not seen in 12 years, was favourably impressed enough to invite his family and him to Paris, where he offered Paul Jr. a job as president of Getty Oil&#x27;s Italian subsidiary, Getty Oil Italiana, in Rome.

==Marriages==
His first marriage was to Abigail &quot;Gail&quot; Harris, a former water polo champion. They divorced in 1964, having had four children: John Paul Getty III, Mark Getty, Ariadne Getty and Aileen Getty.

His second marriage was to the Dutch actress, model and style icon Talitha Pol, stepdaughter of painter Augustus John&#x27;s daughter Poppet, on 10 December 1966. The two posed for an iconic photograph on a rooftop in Marrakesh, Morocco, in January 1969. The photo, taken by Patrick Lichfield, shows Talitha Getty crouched down leaning on a wall and her husband in the background in a hooded djellaba and sunglasses. The photo appeared in American &quot;Vogue&quot; and again in the September 1999 issue of American &quot;Vogue&quot; and is part of the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London. Two and a half years after the photo was taken, Talitha died of a heroin overdose on 11 July 1971. She was survived by her son with Getty, Tara Gabriel Gramophone Galaxy Getty (born June 1968), an ecological conservationist in Africa. Tara attended Milton Abbey School in the village of Milton Abbas, near the market town of Blandford Forum in Dorset in South West England. In 1994, he married for the third time to Victoria Holdsworth.

==Personal problems==
After he married Talitha in 1966, the couple became immersed in the counterculture of the 1960s, living between Rome, Italy, and Marrakesh, Morocco. During a trip to Thailand, the couple developed serious heroin addictions. When Getty Sr., who abhorred taking drugs of any kind, heard of his son&#x27;s addiction, he insisted on his becoming sober. Paul Jr. refused and tendered his resignation from Getty Oil Italiana. The couple lived off his income from the family trust, which amounted to $100,000 a year. In 1969, he and Talitha separated as she decided to focus on becoming sober. He purchased No. 16 Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, London, where the Victorian artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti had lived in the 1860s, for Talitha and their son, Tara, to live in, while he remained in Rome.

===Death of Talitha===
After living apart for several years, Talitha, who was sober at the time, asked Paul Jr. for a divorce in early 1971. Still in love with his wife, he insisted that she come to Rome and try for a reconciliation. When her lawyer advised her that divorce proceedings would be easier if she could show that she had attempted reconciliation with Paul, she left for Rome on 9 July. On the morning of 11 July 1971, she was found dead in the Getty apartment in Piazza d&#x27;Aracoeli. The autopsy ruled that she had alcohol and barbiturates in her system, but rumours flared up that she had suffered a heroin relapse while spending time with Getty, who was still embroiled in his addiction.

In December 1971, Italian authorities announced that an inquest would be held into Talitha&#x27;s death the following March. They requested Getty meet with investigators to describe the circumstances surrounding her death. Afraid his own drug addiction would result in his being indicted and potentially imprisoned, Getty left for England. He ignored a subsequent request by an Italian judge to return to Italy for the inquest. Neither an arrest warrant nor an extradition request was ever issued since Getty was not a suspect in Talitha&#x27;s death, but he never returned to Italy for fear of being detained.

==Son&#x27;s kidnapping==
After his second wife&#x27;s death, Getty became reclusive for a time and his heroin addiction worsened, fueled by guilt over his wife&#x27;s death.

In Rome on 10 July 1973, &#x27;Ndrangheta kidnappers abducted Getty&#x27;s 16-year-old son, John Paul Getty III, and demanded a $17 million (equivalent to $ in ) payment for his safe return. However, the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather. Getty Jr. asked his father J. Paul Getty for the money, but was refused, arguing that his 13 other grandchildren could also become kidnap targets if he paid.

In November 1973, an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike. The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid $3.2 million. The demand stated &quot;This is Paul&#x27;s ear. If we don&#x27;t get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.&quot;

When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to $3 million, J. Paul Getty agreed to pay no more than $2.2 million (equivalent to $ in ), the maximum that would be tax-deductible. He lent Getty Jr. the remaining $800,000 at four per cent interest. Getty&#x27;s grandson was found alive on 15 December 1973, in a Lauria filling station, in the province of Potenza, shortly after the ransom was paid. Nine of the kidnappers were apprehended, including Girolamo Piromalli and Saverio Mammoliti, high-ranking members of the &#x27;Ndrangheta, a Mafia organization in Calabria. Two of the kidnappers were convicted and sent to prison; the others were acquitted for lack of evidence, including the &#x27;Ndrangheta bosses. Most of the ransom money was never recovered.

Getty III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Getty III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He died on 5 February 2011, at the age of 54.

==Later life==
Following his father&#x27;s death in 1976, Getty spent the next decade suffering from depression and checked himself into The London Clinic in 1984. While there, he received a visit from Margaret Thatcher, who at the time was Prime Minister, to thank him for large donations to the National Gallery. During a low period in the 1970s, Getty was cheered up by former England cricketer and later president of the MCC, Gubby Allen, having previously been introduced to the game by Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones.

Paul III struggled with PTSD from his kidnapping and with alcohol and drugs. In April 1981, he suffered a drug overdose which left him paralyzed and almost blind. The following November, his mother Gail sued her ex-husband for $25,000 per month to support their son&#x27;s medical expenses. Despite earning more than $20 million a year from his family trust, Paul II refused to pay for the treatment, leaving his brother, Gordon, to pay his nephew&#x27;s expenses. The litigation judge who allowed the case to go to trial scolded Paul Jr.: &quot;Mr. Getty should be ashamed of himself spending far more money on court obligations than living up to his moral duties.&quot; Claiming that he doubted the severity of his son&#x27;s debilitation, Getty sent his lawyer to Los Angeles to confirm it and finally agreed to pay the costs.

===Wormsley Park===
During his nine-month stint in The London Clinic, Getty purchased a dilapidated country estate in Buckinghamshire, Wormsley Park, on the advice of his close friend Christopher Gibbs. After his release in March 1986, he devoted himself to remodeling the 18th-century mansion and restoring the 3,000 acres of parkland. This included the creation of a deer park, the reforestation of 1,500 acres of beechwood forest, and the dredging of a man-made four-acre lake with water tapped from an aquifer 400 feet below ground. Along with the restoration of the Georgian mansion house, Getty added a castle-like addition made of local flint built to house his extensive library, an indoor heated pool, and a replica of The Oval cricket ground. To house his disabled son, he had an accessible cottage built near the pool, from where he could do his water rehabilitation exercises. The six-year project cost an estimated £60 million.

At Wormsley, Getty hosted his estranged family and improved his relations with his children and ex-wife. To inaugurate his professional cricket ground, Getty hosted a match in May 1992 captained by Imran Khan and Bob Wyatt, with the Prime Minister, John Major and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother as his guests of honour. His eponymous cricket eleven comprised cricketing stars of both past and present assembled by his honorary cricket managers, Brian Johnston (1992–1993) and Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie (1994–2006).

==Philanthropy==

Getty donated more than £140m to artistic and cultural causes, from which the National Gallery received £50m. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1987, but as a foreign national could not use the title &quot;Sir&quot;. In December 1997, Getty was granted British citizenship and renounced his US nationality. The Queen reportedly commented: &quot;Now you can use your title. Isn&#x27;t that nice?&quot;

Getty served as president of Surrey County Cricket Club and gave money to Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground to build a new stand. He combined his loves of cricket and books when he purchased the ownership of &quot;Wisden&quot;, the famous publishers of the cricketing almanack. Getty built an extraordinary library at Wormsley, collecting such treasures as a first edition of Chaucer, Ben Jonson&#x27;s annotated copy of Spenser, and Shakespeare Folios. He was a notable member of the exclusive Roxburghe Club, famous among book collectors. He commissioned a facsimile copy of &quot;The Great Book of Thomas Trevilian.&quot; 

His personal fortune was estimated at £1.6 billion. His donations included support for the National Gallery, the British Museum, the British Film Institute, Hereford Cathedral, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the Imperial War Museum, and St. James Catholic Church. Some of his donations, including contributions toward the purchases of Canova&#x27;s &quot;The Three Graces&quot; by The National Galleries of Scotland and the &quot;Madonna of the Pinks&quot; by Raphael, foiled acquisition efforts by the J. Paul Getty Museum endowed by his father. In June 2001, Getty gave £5 million to the Conservative Party. He endowed a £20 million charitable trust to support the arts, conservation and social welfare.

==Death==
Getty died at age 70 on 17 April 2003, having been admitted for treatment to The London Clinic for a chest infection.

==Media portrayals==
Getty Jr. is portrayed by Andrew Buchan in the action film &quot;All the Money in the World&quot; and by Michael Esper in the television series &quot;Trust&quot;, both of which dramatize Getty III&#x27;s kidnapping.

<doc id="212032" wikidata="Q17016310" url="?curid=212032" title="Permit to travel">
<text>In the ticketing system of the British rail network, a Permit to Travel provisionally allows passengers to travel on a train when they have not purchased a ticket in advance and the ticket office of the station they are travelling from is closed, without incurring a penalty fare.

Because some rail passengers may travel without having their tickets checked at any point of their journey, particularly at off-peak times when stations are less likely to be staffed, the obligation to possess a Permit to Travel allows the collection of at least some revenue from passengers who would otherwise travel for free. Most train operating companies (TOCs) have altered their penalty fare policies and have removed many Permit to Travel machines. At larger stations, these stations have also in recent years given way to more sophisticated self-service ticket machines.

==History==
The system, known officially as PERTIS (; acronym for Permit to Travel Issuing System), was first introduced by Network SouthEast in November 1988 on the London, Tilbury and Southend line between London Fenchurch Street and Shoeburyness. The machines, which closely resemble those found in pay and display car parks, were manufactured by Almex Control Systems. Machines were given the designation AS-9 (wall-mounted) or AS-88 (mounted on a metal base), but internal workings and tickets were identical in each case.

Penalty fare schemes spread across Network SouthEast in subsequent years, with AS-88 machines being used exclusively. Railway stations in the West Midlands and West Yorkshire passenger transport executive areas subsequently had schemes put in place, and machines were installed accordingly.

==Use and operation==
The front panel of the machine has two LCD displays; one shows the current time, while the other displays the amount paid when coins have been fed in. A button is pressed to print the permit, which shows a serial number, the station name, the date and time. The passenger is supposed to insert coins as near to the value of the fare as possible (if they know the fare and have enough coins), and some machines have a list of common local single and return fares.

Permits bear the warning that they are not fare tickets and must be exchanged for one at the first opportunity. The record of the station of issue means that passengers who travel using it cannot claim that they just boarded the train (allowing them to travel on a cheaper fare) if they are not reached by a ticket inspector until a few stops after boarding. Permits are in any case valid for only two hours from the time shown on them.

If holders of a Permit to Travel are asked to present their ticket by an inspector, they will be asked where they are travelling to and issued with the appropriate ticket and will be charged the difference between the balance already paid, as stated on the permit and the full cost of the ticket for their journey. If they have already paid the full price of the ticket, it will be exchanged for the permit and no money will change hands.

Because any amount of money on a valid Permit to Travel will ensure that a passenger cannot be charged a penalty fare, it is entirely possible (if the passenger is not encountered by an inspector, who will sell a full ticket) to make a two-hour train journey for as little as five pence (the lowest denomination coin the machine will accept) without breaching any fare regulations.

When a station is staffed and its ticket office open, the machine will usually be deactivated, with a light illuminated to indicate that proper tickets should be purchased.

<text>Reinhard Justus Reginald Selten (; 5 October 1930 – 23 August 2016) was a German economist, who won the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (shared with John Harsanyi and John Nash). He is also well known for his work in bounded rationality and can be considered one of the founding fathers of experimental economics.

== Biography ==
Selten was born in Breslau (Wrocław) in Lower Silesia, now in Poland, to a Jewish father, Adolf Selten (a blind bookseller; d. 1942), and Protestant mother, Käthe Luther. Reinhard Selten was raised as Protestant.

After a brief family exile in Saxony and Austria, Selten returned to Hesse, Germany, after the war and, in high school, read an article in Fortune magazine about game theory by the business writer John D. McDonald. He recalled later, he would occupy his &quot;mind with problems of elementary geometry and algebra&quot; while walking back and forth to school during that time. He studied mathematics at Goethe University Frankfurt and obtained his diploma in 1957. He then worked as scientific assistant to Heinz Sauermann until 1967. In 1959, he married with Elisabeth Langreiner. They had no children. In 1961, he also received his doctorate in Frankfurt in mathematics with a thesis on the evaluation of n-person games.

He was a visiting professor at Berkeley and taught from 1969 to 1972 at the Free University of Berlin and, from 1972 to 1984, at the University of Bielefeld. He then accepted a professorship at the University of Bonn. There he built the BonnEconLab, a laboratory for experimental economic research, where he was active even after his retirement.

Selten was professor emeritus at the University of Bonn, Germany, and held several honorary doctoral degrees. He had been an Esperantist since 1959 and met his wife through the Esperanto movement. He was a member and co-founder of the International Academy of Sciences San Marino.

For the 2009 European Parliament election, he was the top candidate for the German wing of Europe – Democracy – Esperanto.

== Work ==
For his work in game theory, Selten won the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (shared with John Harsanyi and John Nash). Selten was Germany&#x27;s first and, at the time of his death, only Nobel winner for economics.

He is also well known for his work in bounded rationality, and can be considered one of the founding fathers of experimental economics. With Gerd Gigerenzer he edited the book &quot;Bounded Rationality: The Adaptive Toolbox&quot; (2001). He developed an example of a game called Selten&#x27;s Horse because of its extensive form representation. His last work was &quot;Impulse Balance Theory and its Extension by an Additional Criterion&quot;.

He is noted for his publishing in non-refereed journals to avoid being forced to make unwanted changes to his work.

<text>Denis Mostyn Norden (born Denis Moss Cohen; 6 February 1922 – 19 September 2018) was an English comedy writer and television presenter. After an early career working in cinemas, he began scriptwriting during the Second World War. From 1948 to 1959, he co-wrote the BBC Radio comedy programme &quot;Take It from Here&quot; with Frank Muir. Muir and Norden remained associated for more than 50 years, appearing regularly together on the radio panel programmes &quot;My Word!&quot; and &quot;My Music&quot; after they stopped collaborating on scripts. He also wrote scripts for Hollywood films. He presented television programmes on ITV for many years, including the nostalgia quiz &quot;Looks Familiar&quot; and blooper shows &quot;It&#x27;ll be Alright on the Night&quot; and &quot;Laughter File&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Norden was born as Denis Moss Cohen into a Jewish family in Hackney, in London&#x27;s East End. His parents were George Cohen, a tailor specializing in bridal gowns, and his wife Ginny (née Lubelsky), who was of Polish heritage. The family name was changed by deed poll to Norden while Denis was a child. He was educated at Craven Park Elementary School and the City of London School where he was a contemporary of Kingsley Amis. Upon leaving school, he worked as a stagehand, moved into cinema management by the age of 17 and quickly progressed to be the manager of a cinema in Watford. He also organised variety shows. He joined the Royal Air Force during the Second World War and was a wireless operator with a signals unit. His writing career began in the Royal Air Force when he wrote for troop shows. Whilst preparing for one of these shows in 1945, Norden, accompanied by fellow performers Eric Sykes and Ron Rich, went to a nearby prison camp in search of stage lighting; the camp turned out to be the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, which had recently been liberated by the Allies. Norden, Sykes and Rich organised a food collection amongst their comrades to feed the starving camp inmates.

After the war, Norden wrote material for comedian Dick Bentley, before meeting Frank Muir (who wrote for comic actor Jimmy Edwards) in 1947; they were brought together by producer Ted Kavanagh. Muir and Norden&#x27;s first joint venture was a radio show for both performers, &quot;Take it from Here!&quot;, which they scripted from 1948 to 1959. They went on to write many successful radio and television scripts, including &quot;Whack-O!&quot; (1956–1960) and three series of &quot;Faces of Jim&quot; (1961–1963) which were vehicles for Jimmy Edwards. They also wrote the satirical sketch &quot;Balham, Gateway to the South&quot; for the BBC Third Programme. The sketch, which had originally been broadcast in 1948 as part of a comedy series called &quot;The Third Division&quot; and which featured actor Robert Beatty, was later performed by Peter Sellers for his LP, &quot;The Best of Sellers&quot; (1959). In the early 1960s, Muir and Norden wrote the sitcom &quot;Brothers in Law&quot;, an early series featuring Richard Briers, and its spin-off &quot;Mr Justice Duncannon&quot;.

In 1964, their writing partnership ended, as Muir moved into management with the BBC. Over the next several years, Norden, who had long had a fascination with Hollywood, wrote the scripts for several films, including &quot;Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell!&quot; and &quot;The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom&quot;. Although he was no longer writing with Muir, the two regularly appeared together on panel shows &quot;My Word!&quot; (1956–1990) and &quot;My Music&quot; (1966–1993), first on radio then television. In 1965, he wrote, narrated and starred in a featurette jointly made by the James Bond producers and the Ford Motor Company. The colour short, entitled &quot;A Child&#x27;s Guide to Blowing up a Motor Car&quot;, went behind the scenes of an exploding car stunt being filmed for &quot;Thunderball&quot;. Norden takes a young relative on a day out to a film set, where they meet several stars and production team members, but not Sean Connery. Lost for many years, it is now available on the &#x27;Ultimate Edition&#x27; DVD of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, as released in late 2006.

==ITV presenter==
Norden was also later well known to television audiences for his ITV shows: &quot;Looks Familiar&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot; and &quot;Laughter File&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot;, which he hosted from 1977 until 2006, consisted of out-takes from film and television linked by comments. Much of the material from the early episodes was used on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Bloopers&quot; specials which aired on NBC a few years later. A couple of mid-1980s editions featured several home video clips: with the increasing private ownership of domestic camcorders, clips were spun off into the long-running &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot; (1990–2022). &quot;Laughter File&quot;, first broadcast in 1991, showed spoof adverts, real foreign adverts, practical jokes, live television mistakes and other various &quot;oddities&quot;, which Norden said, &quot;tickled our fancies, just when they needed tickling&quot;. These items included virtually everything discovered during research for material suitable for &quot;It&#x27;ll be Alright on the Night&quot; that was not eligible for that show.

==Retirement and legacy==
Norden announced his retirement from his two long-running ITV shows &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot; and &quot;Laughter File&quot; on 21 April 2006. He was then 84 years old and suffering from macular degeneration, which made it difficult for him to read an autocue. A special show was recorded on 14 May 2006 as a &#x27;farewell tour&#x27; to all his shows over the years, called &quot;All the Best from Denis Norden&quot;, which was shown on 2 January 2007. As the show&#x27;s closing credits were shown, the studio audience gave Norden a standing ovation, which was followed by him then placing his trademark clipboard on his desk, which the camera zoomed in on to as the credits ended. He has since been succeeded on &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot; by Griff Rhys Jones and later by David Walliams.

For years, Norden was resistant to producing an autobiography, saying that much of his life and career had already been well covered by Frank Muir&#x27;s &quot;A Kentish Lad&quot; and that a book called &quot;The Bits Frank Left Out&quot; would be too brief. Nevertheless, in October 2008, a book containing a sequence of autobiographical sketches was published entitled &quot;Clips from a Life&quot;. He continued to make occasional television and radio appearances. He contributed to a BBC Four season about the history of satire, and he appeared as a guest on &quot;The One Show&quot; on 2 October 2008 to talk about his life and career as well as his book. He was interviewed in a one-off documentary called &quot;Der Sommer 1939&quot; (&quot;The Summer of 1939&quot;), which was broadcast on 12 August 2009 on the Franco-German television station Arte. Norden also appeared as part of a contribution of show business friends, writers and performers in the BBC documentary &quot;The Secret Life of Bob Monkhouse&quot; in January 2011.

==Personal life and death==
Norden and his wife, Avril, whom he married in 1943, had a son, Nick, an architect, and a daughter, Maggie, a radio personality and lecturer at the London College of Fashion. Maggie was a presenter on London&#x27;s Capital Radio in its early days and presented the Sunday afternoon programme &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;. Affected by macular degeneration, Norden joined Peter Sallis and Eric Sykes in 2009 as a patron of The Macular Society, after becoming a member in 2004.

Norden died at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London on 19 September 2018, aged 96, less than three months after the death of his wife.

<text>Loei (Thai: , ), is one of the more sparsely populated provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. It lies in the Isan region of upper northeastern Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from east clockwise) Nong Khai, Udon Thani, Nong Bua Lamphu, Khon Kaen, Phetchabun, and Phitsanulok. In the north it borders Xaignabouli and Vientiane province of Laos.

, the provincial governor is Chaiwat Chuenkosum. The province was allocated 225.6 million baht in the FY2019 Thailand budget.

==History==
Loei was founded by a Thai tribe from the Kingdom of Yonok Chiang Saen. Khun Pha Muang founded the village of Dan-kwa, and Bang Klang Hao founded Dan Sai. Drought and disease later led to the villagers move to the site of present-day Loei.

In 1907, King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) created Loei province. The Loei Cultural Centre (ศูนย์วัฒนธรรมจังหวัดเลย) displays Loei&#x27;s history, religions, and traditions. The province is home to many Lao people who fled the Communist take-over of the Kingdom of Laos. The area of the province along the Lao border is used by the Laotians to buy and sell goods with the locals on the Thai side.

== Geography ==
The province is mountainous. The seat of provincial government, Loei, is in a fertile basin surrounded by mountains whose summits are covered by fog and abundant varied flora. The best known mountains in the province are Phu Kradueng, Phu Luang, and Phu Ruea. The Loei River, which flows through the province, is a tributary of the Mekong, which forms part of the northern boundary of the province with neighboring Laos. Phu Thap Buek, the highest mountain of the Phetchabun Range, is in the province.
The mountain Phu Kradueng is in Phu Kradueng National Park (อุทยานแห่งชาติภูกระดึง).
The western part of the province reaches the southern end of the Luang Prabang Range of the Thai highlands.
The total forested area is or 32.2 percent of the province.

* Phu Kho–Phu Kratae Wildlife Sanctuary, 

== Demographics ==
Loei province is home to several Tai peoples. The indigenous people are the Tai Lue, while the Phuan, Tai Dam, Thai, and Chinese people make up the rest of the population. The Tai Phuan people came to the province after migrating from Luang Prabang in Laos.

==Symbols==
The seal of the province shows the stupa at Phra That Si Song Rak, which was built in 1560 by King Maha Chakrapat of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and King Saysettha of Lan Xang as a symbol of friendship between the two kingdoms. The provincial tree is the Khasi pine (&quot;Pinus kesiya&quot;). &quot;Altigena lippa&quot; the cyprinid fish is the provincial aquatic life.

The provincial slogan is &quot;city of the sea of mountains, coldest place in Siam, with beautiful flowers of three seasons.&quot;

==Economy==
Agriculture drives Loei&#x27;s economy. Macadamia nuts, passion fruit, and Arabica coffee are grown in the highlands; bananas, sesame, and rubber on the plains. Loei is an ecotourism destination due to its natural environment and amalgam of northern and northeastern cultures.

Wang Saphung District is the site of a large open pit gold mine that employs many locals. The locality has been the site of a long-standing dispute as well as physical conflict between the villagers of Ban Na Nong Bong and its environs and Tungkum Limited, a subsidiary of Tongkah Harbour PCL. Tungkum&#x27;s gold mining operation has been accused in the courts of environmental destruction.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 14 districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further divided into 89 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 839 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Loei Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 29 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Loei with Wang Saphung have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. There are a further 27 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 71 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations, SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="212054" wikidata="Q1583515" url="?curid=212054" title="Little raven">
<text>The little raven (Corvus mellori) is a species of the family Corvidae that is native to southeastern Australia. An adult individual is about in length, with completely black plumage, beak, and legs; as with all Australian species of &quot;Corvus&quot;, the black feathers have a grey base, and the iris of the adult bird is white (typical also of some related species from islands to the north of Australia). Although the little raven was first named by Gregory Mathews in 1912, it was only in 1967 that there was consensus to separate it from the Australian raven (&quot;C. coronoides&quot;) as a distinct species.

==Taxonomy==
In the 1960s, the CSIRO were intensively studying Australian raven populations and their relationship to lambing and sheep in southeastern Australia. It became evident that there was a smaller species of raven living alongside the Australian raven. These birds lived in smaller trees, had smaller throat hackles and lacked the bare skin of their larger relative. They were also nomadic and made different calls. Ian Rowley investigated old scientific names assigned to type specimens and concluded that they matched &quot;Corvus mellori&quot; as described by Gregory Mathews in 1912. The type specimen was collected from Angas Plains in South Australia in 1901. It disappeared in transit in 1966.

The little raven is closely related to the other four species of Australian corvid, which include the Torresian crow and little crow as well as the forest raven and Australian raven. Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the little raven may be nested within the Australian raven, though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed. Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 showed the forest and little raven are each other&#x27;s closest relatives, with the Australian raven an earlier offshoot.

Rowley proposed that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north. The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens in the east and Australian raven in the west. As the climate was cooler and drier, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely. Furthermore, the eastern diverged into nomadic little ravens as the climate became dryer and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western ravens spread eastwards and outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia but coexisted with little ravens.

Rowley proposed the name &quot;little raven&quot; for the new species, conceding it was generic but noting it was demonstrative, and that &quot;little crow&quot; had been adopted over &quot;Bennett&#x27;s crow&quot; for &quot;Corvus bennettii&quot;. The name has since been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). The term &quot;crow&quot; is colloquially applied to any or all species of Australian corvid.

==Description==
The little raven is, at about 48–50 cm in length on average, somewhat smaller than the Australian raven (though sizes do overlap between both species), the little raven&#x27;s beak is slightly smaller. The little raven is a somewhat more sociable species than the Australian raven, often forming large flocks that roam freely over wide areas in search of food.

Eye colour varies with age: nestlings up to three months old have blue-grey eyes, juveniles aged from three to eleven months have brown eyes, and immature birds have hazel eyes with blue eyerings around the pupil until age one year and eleven months. The eyes turn white when the birds mature into adults.

===Vocalisations===
Its call is a harsh, guttural &quot;kar-kar-kar-karrr&quot; or &quot;ark-ark-ark-arrk&quot; with a similarly drawn-out call to the Australian and forest raven. Like all species of raven in Australia (with the exception of the forest raven) the little raven sometimes stretches or flicks its wings outward slightly when calling. Like all corvids, the little raven is capable of vocal mimicry, but this behavior is mostly recorded in captivity and only rarely in the wild.

==Distribution and habitat==
The little raven ranges over southeastern Australia from southern South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. Also in Kangaroo Island (S.A) and King Island (Bass Strait).
Living within scrub, agricultural areas, grazing pasture, woodlands to treeless plains, coasts, and suburbs.

Little ravens are absent from west Gippsland, where the land is dominated by forest ravens

Its large range, abundance and stable population mean it is classified as &quot;least concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List.

The little raven appears to have become more abundant and widespread in Melbourne since the 1980s, spreading northwards and westwards, adapting well to its urban surrounds. Meanwhile, the Australian raven has only been rarely recorded in the city&#x27;s outer fringes. The opposite phenomenon has taken place in Canberra and Sydney, where it is the Australian raven that has adapted and become common while the little raven has remained uncommon.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Little ravens often nest in a loose colony of up to fifteen pairs, with nests few metres apart. They are closer together as the territories are for breeding only and not feeding, which is more communal. They have often been recorded as having several nests within the nesting territory of a single Australian raven which, presumably due to different food preferences, does not seem to consider them a threat to its own food resources. Cover does not appear to be important as dead trees with bare branches are used.

The nest is a thin cup of sticks with a layer of bark, grass and wool to create a thick mat. Nests are commonly low to the ground (under 10 meters), often in a forked branch in the outer canopy of a tree. Nests in urban Melbourne have been increasingly found at greater distances above the ground, as have nests in areas where Australian ravens do not occur, suggesting that the lower nests eventuated when the little raven was in competition with its larger relative. Nests on the ground have been reported. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) to wedge sticks into the tree fork to make a platform. Thinner sticks and rootlets are used to make the bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers. Both birds build the nest, with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material. New nests are built each year generally, as the re-use of old ones might spread disease or parasites—nests become caked with faeces as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal. Old nests often disintegrate within twelve months anyway due to their exposed locations.

A clutch can comprise up to six eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with four being the commonest number. Eggs are quite variable and cannot be reliably identified as to which Australian corvid laid them, however the colouration of the two crow species eggs is different from the three ravens. Ravens&#x27; eggs are a light turquoise with brown blotches, but crows&#x27; eggs are a dirty white with brown speckles.

They leave the nest at 33–41 days of age.

===Feeding===
Little ravens eat more insects than &quot;C. coronoides&quot; and feed mainly on the ground, but they are probably omnivorous to a similar extent to other &quot;Corvus&quot; species when opportunity arises. Common invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes, centipedes (which ravens behead before eating), grasshoppers, cicadas and caterpillars (especially of the family Noctuidae), which are important in feeding nestlings.

Little ravens are intelligent birds, and have been recorded using tools as well as having innovative methods of seeking out food.

<doc id="212056" wikidata="Q382144" url="?curid=212056" title="Kalasin province">
<text>Kalasin (, ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;), located in upper northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. The province was established by the , and it came into existence on 1 October 1947.
Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Sakon Nakhon, Mukdahan, Roi Et, Maha Sarakham, Khon Kaen, and Udon Thani.

==Geography==
Most of the province is covered by a hilly landscape. The town of Kalasin is at an elevation of . In the north is the Lam Pao Dam built from 1963 to 1968. It stores 1,430 million m3 of water for flood prevention and agriculture. The Lam Pao reservoir effectively cuts the northern part of the province in half, but there are car ferries connecting the district of Sahatsakhan in the east with the district Nong Kung Si in the west, saving up to one hour off the journey by road. On the northwestern creek of the reservoir, a road bridge connects the village of Ban Dong Bang in the west with the district town of Wang Sam Mo in the east. Although the bridge was constructed several years ago (pre-2000), it is not featured (2006) on any commercially available road maps.
Kalasin is known for the dinosaur fossils found at Phu Kum Khao (Sahatsakhan District), the largest dinosaur site in Thailand. Most of the fossils are sauropods from 120 million years ago.

The Phu Phan mountain range marks the border with Sakhon Nakhon province, part of which is preserved as a national park. The total forest area is or 10.9 percent of provincial area.
===National parks===
There are two national parks, along with five other national parks, make up region 10 (Udon Thani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Phu Phan National Park, 
* Phu Pha Lek National Park, 
===Wildlife sanctuary===
There is one wildlife sanctuary , along with five other wildlife sanctuaries, make up region 9 (Ubon Ratchathani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Phu Si Than Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==Economy==
Kalasin is an agricultural province producing sticky rice and other cash crops such as manioc (cassava) and sugar cane. Families typically live in a stress free environment simply growing fruits and vegetables to live off in this essentially rural area and make ends meet by producing baskets and the silk for which the region is renowned.

==History==
During the Cretaceous, dinosaurs such as Phuwiangosaurus, Psittacosaurus and Siamosaurus lived in the area around the province. Phu Faek Forest Park contains the remains of several footprints and were discovered in 1996.

Archaeological excavations at Mueang Fa Daet Song Yang, a site located within the province, uncovered an inscription in the Old Mon language, which provides insights into the language and culture of the Mon people during the 8th century CE Dvaravati period This inscription is significant for shedding light on the history and development of the Old Mon language, and its role in the region’s history and culture during the Dvaravati period in Northeastern Thailand. Similar inscriptions have also been found in Maha Sarakham and Khon Kaen provinces, highlighting the broader importance of this discovery for the study of the Dvaravati period in Northeastern Thailand.

The first official town was founded in 1793. During the &quot;Thesaphiban&quot; reforms in the reign of King Rama V at the beginning of the 20th century, the town (&quot;mueang&quot;) was upgraded to a province. In 1932, when the country experienced the great economic depression, the province was demoted and absorbed as a district by Maha Sarakham province to reduce the financial burden on the country, Kalasin was dependent on Maha Sarakham for 16 years. After the great recession and World War II, it once again became a province in 1947.

In 2023, Kalasin hospital collaborated with Kalasin prison to open a new medical room to treet sick inmates.

== Demographics ==
Languages such as Thai, Isaan and Phu Thai are spoken by people around the province.

==Symbols==
The seal of the province shows a pond in front of the Phu Phan Mountains which form the boundary of the province. The water in the pond is black, as the name Kalasin means &quot;black water&quot;. The big clouds as well as the water symbolize the fertility of the province.

The provincial logo and landmark is the Phra That Yakhu, an octagonal-shaped chedi, made of bricks.

The provincial flower is &quot;payorm&quot; or &quot;sweet shorea&quot; (&quot;Shorea roxburghii&quot;), and the provincial tree is &quot;sa-mae-san &quot; (&quot;Cassia garrettiana&quot;). The provincial aquatic life is the &quot;edible carp&quot; &quot;Thynnichthys thynnoides&quot;.

The provincial slogan is &quot;Fa Daet Song Yang ancient city, Pong Lang folk music, Phu Thai culture, Phrae Wa silk, Pha Saweoi Phu Phan, Lam Pao River, and million-year dinosaurs&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 18 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further divided into 134 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 1,509 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Kalasin Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 79 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Kalasin and Bua Khao have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 77 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 71 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="212061" wikidata="Q2531254" url="?curid=212061" title="A Night on the Town (Rod Stewart album)">
<text>A Night on the Town is Rod Stewart&#x27;s seventh album, released in 1976. The cover art is based on Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s painting &quot;Bal du moulin de la Galette&quot;, with Stewart inserted in the centre in period costume. On 30 June 2009, Rhino reissued the album as a two-disc CD with bonus tracks. &quot;A Night on the Town&quot; was Stewart&#x27;s last UK number-one studio album until &quot;Time&quot; in 2013.

The album is regarded as one of Stewart&#x27;s finest. &quot;The Killing of Georgie&quot; is one of Stewart&#x27;s most hard-hitting sets of lyrics, a melancholic tale of a gay friend who is cast out by his family and becomes a sensation in the New York nightlife, only to be murdered by a New Jersey gang during an attempted robbery. Controversial &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; was a No. 1 hit but was banned by some radio stations due to the very obvious lyrics about sex and loss of virginity. A cover of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot; was also a success and has since become one of Stewart&#x27;s signature songs.

<doc id="212064" wikidata="Q2411764" url="?curid=212064" title="Atlantic Crossing">
<text>Atlantic Crossing is the sixth solo album by Rod Stewart. Released on 15 August 1975, and recorded in five American studios including Muscle Shoals, Alabama, between April and June 1975, it was produced by Tom Dowd, and peaked at number one in the UK (his fourth solo album to do so), and number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart.The album was divided into a fast side and a slow side, apparently at the suggestion of Stewart&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Swedish actress Britt Ekland. Stewart would repeat the format for his next two albums. The album contained two of Stewart&#x27;s most popular songs, &quot;Sailing&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It”, and classic rock favourites &quot;Three Time Loser&quot; and &quot;Stone Cold Sober&quot;. The album was the 14th of Stewart&#x27;s career, starting with Jeff Beck&#x27;s &quot;Truth&quot; in 1968, and his sixth solo. 

==Recording==

The album was recorded in five different American studios: A&amp;R (New York), Criteria (Miami), Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 (Hollywood), Hi Recording Studio (Memphis), and Muscle Shoals (Alabama) between April and June 1975, and produced by Tom Dowd, who had been the engineer or producer for many of Stewart&#x27;s heroes during Dowd&#x27;s time at Atlantic Records. 

With &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot;, Stewart ended his association with Ronnie Wood, Ian McLagan and the stable of musicians who had been his core collaborators on his classic run of albums for Mercury Records, fusing soul and folk. Instead, he used a group of session musicians, including The Memphis Horns and Booker T. and the MG&#x27;s. The only song performed from this album on The Faces&#x27; final US tour in autumn 1975 was &quot;Three Time Loser&quot;, and the rest of the group heavily disliked Stewart&#x27;s change in musical direction on this album. Following the success of the album, and his move to the U.S., Stewart announced his exit from the Faces by the end of the year.

==Release==
&quot;Sailing&quot; was a number one hit in the UK in September 1975, and returned to the UK Top 3 a year later when it was used as the theme for the BBC series &quot;Sailor&quot;; both acoustic and electric guitars in the song were played by Pete Carr. In 1977, almost two years after the album was released, Stewart scored another UK number one from the album with the double A-side single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It&quot; and &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot; (from the album A Night on the Town - 1976).

In 2009, Rhino Records released a two-disc version of the album with bonus tracks.

<text>Blondes Have More Fun is British musician Rod Stewart&#x27;s ninth studio album, released in November 1978. As was the popular musical trend at the time, it is Stewart&#x27;s foray into disco music. The album was commercially successful, reaching number 3 in the UK and number 1 in the US, but was critically divisive. The lead single &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; became one of Stewart&#x27;s biggest hits, peaking at No.1 in both the UK and US.

==Overview==
After carving a highly successful career throughout the 1970s as a rock singer, Stewart elected to follow the disco trend that was at its peak in 1978 for some tracks of this album. The first single was &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; which became a number one hit in the UK, US, Australia and a number of other countries. Many critics panned the direction of song towards disco, but it nevertheless became one of his biggest hits. Stewart has since defended the song commenting that Paul McCartney and The Rolling Stones had also dabbled with disco music by this time. The second single was &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love a Bitch&quot;, which became a No.11 hit in the UK and No.22 in the US. The third and final single &quot;Blondes (Have More Fun)&quot; peaked at 63 in the UK, his lowest-charting single there at this time, but performed better in Ireland at No.23.

The album itself peaked at No.3 in the UK, being certified platinum by Christmas and was a No.1 hit in the US, where it went triple platinum. It also charted within the top ten in a host of other countries.

==Track listing==

 Stewart has acknowledged that the song inadvertently incorporates the melody from the song &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; by Jorge Ben Jor, although Ben Jor was not given a writing credit.

<text>Dario Argento (; born 7 September 1940) is an Italian film director, screenwriter and producer. His influential work in the horror and giallo genres during the 1970s and 1980s has led him to being referred to as the &quot;Master of the Thrill&quot; and the &quot;Master of Horror&quot;.

His films as director include his &quot;Animal Trilogy&quot;, consisting of &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot; (1970), &quot;The Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails&quot; (1971) and &quot;Four Flies on Grey Velvet&quot; (1971); his &quot;Three Mothers&quot; trilogy, consisting of &quot;Suspiria&quot; (1977), &quot;Inferno&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Mother of Tears&quot; (2007); and his stand-alone films &quot;Deep Red&quot; (1975), &quot;Tenebrae&quot; (1982), &quot;Phenomena&quot; (1985) and &quot;Opera&quot; (1987). He co-wrote the screenplay for Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968) and served as George A. Romero&#x27;s script consultant on &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978), for which he also composed the soundtrack with his long-time collaborators Goblin.

== Early life ==

Argento was born in Rome, the son of Sicilian film producer and executive Salvatore Argento (1914–1987) and Brazilian photographer Elda Luxardo (1915–2013), who was of Italian ancestry. While still attending a Catholic secondary school as a teenager, Argento began working as a film critic, writing for magazines and as a columnist for the Rome-based newspaper &quot;Paese Sera&quot; While working at the newspaper, Argento also began working as a screenwriter. His most notable works were for Sergio Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci and his collaboration on the story for the Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; in 1968.

==Career==
===1970s===

Argento began work on his directorial debut, the &quot;giallo&quot; film &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;uccello dalle piume di cristallo&quot;, 1970), which was a major hit in Italy. Argento continued to concentrate largely on the &quot;giallo&quot; genre, directing two more successful thrillers, &quot;The Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails&quot; (&quot;Il gatto a nove code&quot;, 1971) and &quot;Four Flies on Grey Velvet&quot; (&quot;4 mosche di velluto grigio&quot;, 1972). Along with &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot;, these three films are frequently referred to as Argento&#x27;s &quot;Animal Trilogy&quot;. The director then turned his attention away from &quot;giallo&quot; movies, filming two Italian TV dramas and a period comedy, &quot;The Five Days&quot; (&quot;Le cinque giornate&quot;, 1973). Argento returned to thrillers with &quot;Deep Red&quot; (1975), frequently cited by many critics as the best &quot;giallo&quot; ever made. The film made Argento known internationally and inspired other directors to work in the genre. John Carpenter has frequently referred to the influence Argento&#x27;s early work had on &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978).

Argento&#x27;s next film was &quot;Suspiria&quot; (1977), a supernatural horror. Argento planned for &quot;Suspiria&quot; to be the first of a trilogy about &quot;The Three Mothers&quot;, three ancient witches residing in three different modern cities. The second film of the trilogy was 1980&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. &quot;The Mother of Tears&quot; (2007) concluded the trilogy.

In 1978, Argento collaborated with George A. Romero on &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, earning a producer credit and also providing soundtrack work for the zombie film. Argento oversaw the European release of the film, where it was titled &quot;Zombi&quot;, which was much shorter and featured more of the score written and performed by Goblin.

===1980s===
After &quot;Inferno&quot;, Argento returned to the more conventional &quot;giallo &quot;style with &quot;Tenebrae&quot; (1982). He then attempted to combine &quot;giallo &quot;and supernatural fantasy in 1985&#x27;s &quot;Phenomena&quot;, also known as &quot;Creepers&quot;, which was one of Jennifer Connelly&#x27;s earliest movies. &quot;Phenomena&quot; also showed Argento&#x27;s predilection for using new technology, as evidenced by the film&#x27;s several prowling Steadicam shots. Both films received a lukewarm reception upon their release (although each has been positively reappraised since).

Argento subsequently took a break from directing to write two screenplays for Mario Bava&#x27;s son, Lamberto Bava: &quot;Dèmoni&quot; (1985) and &quot;Dèmoni 2&quot; (1986).

&quot;Opera&quot; followed in 1987. Set in Parma&#x27;s Regio Theatre during a production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the production was beset by real-life misfortunes that Argento suspected were caused by the supposed traditional &quot;curse&quot; on the Shakespearean play. Argento&#x27;s father died during its production, Vanessa Redgrave quit the project before filming began, he had problems working with his former long-time girlfriend and collaborator Daria Nicolodi on-set, and the cast and crew were plagued by several minor accidents and mishaps.

In 1987–88, Argento produced a TV series called &quot;Turno di Notte&quot;, which had 15 episodes. Nine of the shows were directed by Luigi Cozzi, the other six by Lamberto Bava. Daria Nicolodi and Asia Argento starred in several of the episodes.

Argento later produced and wrote the screenplays for two horror films directed by Michele Soavi, &quot;The Church&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Sect&quot; (1991).

===1990s===

In 1990, Argento co-directed &quot;Two Evil Eyes&quot; with George Romero, a two-story anthology film inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe.

In 1992, Argento filmed &quot;Trauma&quot;, starring his daughter Asia Argento, in Minneapolis, MN. It is largely a traditional giallo, but in an American setting. Like many of Argento&#x27;s films, it contains an optical illusion witnessed by a character stumbling upon a murder, but he or she, like the audience, misinterprets the nature of the crime. This cinematic sleight-of-hand is one of Argento&#x27;s recurring motifs.

His 1996 film &quot;The Stendhal Syndrome&quot;, in which a policewoman (played by Argento&#x27;s daughter, Asia) who suffers from Stendhal syndrome is trapped by a serial killer in an abandoned warehouse, was the first Italian film to use computer-generated imagery. Moreover, the film&#x27;s opening scene was shot in Florence at Italy&#x27;s famed Uffizi Gallery. Argento is the only director ever granted permission to shoot there. &quot;The Stendhal Syndrome&quot; was distributed in the U.S. by cult B-movie distribution company Troma Entertainment.

In the early 1990s, Argento was interested in collaborating with Italian director Lucio Fulci on a horror film. Due to financial setbacks, the project was repeatedly postponed. In 1996, Argento was able to gather the funding, but was unable at that point to collaborate with Fulci who died in March of that year. The film was later directed by Sergio Stivaletti as &quot;Wax Mask&quot;, with Argento and Fulci both receiving co-screenwriting credits.

Argento later directed 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;Sleepless&quot;.

===2000s and 2010s===

In 2004, Argento directed &quot;The Card Player&quot;, a &quot;giallo&quot; about a killer whose murders are conducted during Internet poker matches with the Rome police, which earned a mixed reception; some fans appreciated the techno music score composed by ex-Goblin member Claudio Simonetti, but felt the film was too mainstream, with little of Argento&#x27;s usual flourish.

In the 2005 TV broadcast of Argento&#x27;s &quot;Do You Like Hitchcock?&quot;, the director paid&quot; homage&quot; to Alfred Hitchcock after decades of being compared to him by critics. Later that year, he directed an episode of &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;, a Showtime television series, called &quot;Jenifer&quot;. For season two of the series, Argento directed &quot;Pelts&quot;, an adaption of the F. Paul Wilson short story of the same name.

In 2007, Argento finished the final film of his Three Mothers trilogy, &quot;The Mother of Tears&quot;, which is set in Rome and centres on the titular &quot;third mother&quot;, Mater Lacrimarum. Argento and Jace Anderson share writing credits for the film. Asia Argento was cast as the lead player, along with her mother and frequent Argento collaborator Daria Nicolodi in a supporting role. Udo Kier, who appeared in Argento&#x27;s &quot;Suspiria&quot;, and Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni, who appeared in three of his previous films, both have pivotal roles in the final &quot;Mothers&quot; chapter.

On 26 June 2009, &quot;Giallo&quot; premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival. The following month, he announced that he had started working on a 3D remake of &quot;Deep Red&quot;, but subsequently this project was shelved due to the commercial failure of &quot;Giallo&quot; in Italian cinemas. He then announced his decision to write a new screenplay . On 4 March 2011, it was announced that Rutger Hauer had signed on to play Van Helsing in Argento&#x27;s &quot;Dracula 3D&quot;, which began shooting in Budapest later in the year. It was released on 19 May 2012 to generally negative reviews.

=== 2020s ===
In 2021, Argento returned to acting and portrayed Lui in Gaspar Noe&#x27;s 2021 psychological drama film &quot;Vortex&quot;. The film screened in the Premiere section at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim for his performance.

In 2022, Argento directed &quot;Dark Glasses&quot;, in his first directorial work since the 2012 film &quot;Dracula 3D.&quot;

===Unrelated projects===
In 2014, Argento was slated to direct &quot;The Sandman&quot;, which had Iggy Pop attached to star and a script by David Tully. The film successfully raised over $195,000 from over 1,000 backers on Indiegogo in December 2014. However, filming has not commenced as of 2023, and the project producers have not updated the film&#x27;s status to backers since August 2017.

Italian director Luca Guadagnino helmed &quot;Suspiria&quot; (2018), a remake of Argento&#x27;s 1977 film. The American screenplay is based on the original script Argento wrote with Daria Nicolodi, his former long-term partner.

In 2019, Argento announced that he was developing a female-led serial movie, consisting of eight episodes, for a streaming service.

== Other work ==

He is involved in operating a horror memorabilia store located at Via dei Gracchi 260 in Rome named Profondo Rosso, after his classic film &quot;Deep Red&quot;. In the cellar is a collection of his movies. The store is managed by his long-time collaborator and friend Luigi Cozzi.

He has contributed in the development of the survival horror video game &quot;Dead Space&quot;, and also in the dubbing of the Dr. Kyne character in the Italian version of the game.

He is acting as an artistic director on Clod Studio&#x27;s upcoming video game &quot;Dreadful Bond&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Between 1968 and 1972, Argento was married to Marisa Casale, the great-granddaughter of Italian composer, pianist and conductor Alfredo Casella. Argento and Casale had one child, actress and costume designer Fiore Argento (born in 1970).

Argento had a professional and romantic relationship with Italian actress and screenwriter Daria Nicolodi; they met in 1974 during casting for &quot;Deep Red&quot;, and their daughter Asia Argento was born in 1975. Nicolodi co-wrote Argento&#x27;s &quot;Suspiria&quot; (1977) and appeared in Argento&#x27;s &quot;Deep Red&quot; (1975), &quot;Inferno&quot; (1980), &quot;Tenebrae&quot; (1982), &quot;Phenomena&quot; (1985), &quot;Opera&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Mother of Tears&quot; (2007). Argento and Nicolodi separated in 1985.

An actress and director, Asia Argento&#x27;s earliest screen appearances includes roles in her father&#x27;s productions &quot;Demons 2&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Church&quot; (1989) before being directed by her father in the films &quot;Trauma&quot; (1993), &quot;The Stendahl Syndrome&quot; (1996), &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1998), &quot;The Mother of Tears&quot; (2007), and &quot;Dracula 3D&quot; (2012).

== Works and criticism==

Maitland McDonagh wrote about Argento in her book &quot;Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento&quot; (1991). Argento is also the subject of &quot;Art of Darkness&quot;, a collection of critical essays, reviews, promotional stills, and poster art edited by Chris Gallant. British journalist Alan Jones published &quot;Profondo Argento&quot;, a compendium of set reports, interviews, and biographical detail. English sound designer, writer, and musician Heather Emmett published &quot;Sounds to Die For: Speaking the Language of Horror Film Sound&quot;, which includes the first in-depth study of the use of sound in Argento&#x27;s films.

In 2012, Argento was highlighted in the retrospective &quot;Argento: Il Cinema Nel Sangue&quot; at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. The retrospective celebrated the influence of the Argento family on filmmaking in Italy and around the world. It highlighted Dario&#x27;s contribution, as well as that of his father (Salvatore), brother (Claudio), ex-wife (Daria Nicolodi) and daughter (Asia).

=== Critical decline ===
With the exceptions of &quot;The Stendhal Syndrome&quot; and &quot;Sleepless&quot;, all of Argento&#x27;s films since the &quot;golden age&quot; of the 1970s and 1980s have been generally poorly received by critics and fans alike, including Argento scholars such as Maitland McDonagh. &quot;Fangoria&quot; wrote in 2010, &quot;over the last decade, standards have slipped. For a filmmaker who was always so precise in his construction and cutting, his later films such as &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and &quot;The Card Player&quot; are sloppy, stitched together so carelessly that they leak vital fluid. Gradually, the kaleidoscopic style that once characterized his films has slowly blanched away.&quot;

<text>The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC, ; simply called the Irish Constabulary 1836–67) was the police force in Ireland from 1822 until 1922, when all of the island was part of the United Kingdom. A separate civic police force, the unarmed Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP), patrolled the capital and parts of County Wicklow, while the cities of Derry and Belfast, originally with their own police forces, later had special divisions within the RIC. For most of its history, the ethnic and religious makeup of the RIC broadly matched that of the Irish population, although Anglo-Irish Protestants were overrepresented among its senior officers.

The RIC was under the authority of the British administration in Ireland. It was a quasi-military police force. Unlike police elsewhere in the United Kingdom, RIC constables were routinely armed (including with carbines) and billeted in barracks, and the force had a militaristic structure. It policed Ireland during a period of agrarian unrest and Irish nationalist freedom fighting. It was used to quell civil unrest during the Tithe War, the Young Irelander Rebellion, the Fenian Rising, the Land War, and the Irish revolutionary period. 

During the Irish War of Independence, the RIC faced mass public boycotts and attacks by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). It was reinforced with recruits from Britain—the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries—who became notorious for police brutality and attacks on civilians. The Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) was formed to reinforce the RIC in most of the northern province of Ulster.

In consequence of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and partition of Ireland, the RIC was disbanded in 1922 and was replaced by the in the Irish Free State and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland.

The RIC&#x27;s system of policing influenced the armed Canadian North-West Mounted Police (predecessor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), the armed Victoria Police force in Australia, the New Zealand Armed Constabulary, the armed Royal Newfoundland Constabulary in Newfoundland and the British South Africa Police in Rhodesia.

==History==


The first organised police forces in Ireland came about through Dublin Police Act 1786, which was a slightly modified version of the failed London and Westminster Police Bill 1785 drafted by John Reeves at the request of Home Secretary Lord Sydney following the Gordon Riots of 1780. A force of 400 armed policemen and 40 mounted petty constables, all full-time and uniformed, headed by three commissioners, four divisional judges and two clerks, was viewed as oppressive by local elites and became a strain on the city budget. The population of Dublin was under 300,000 at the time, which makes a very high rate of police officers per capita. That arguably excessive budget was used as a pretext by Irish nationalist MP Henry Grattan and short-lived Lord Lieutenant of Ireland William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam, to essentially abolish the Dublin Police in 1795 (even despite some success with fighting the crime), downsizing it to two inspectors and 50 constables headed by superintendend magistrate and two divisional justices and even temporarily moving it under Dublin Corporation.

The Peace Preservation Act 1814 for which Sir Robert Peel (1788–1850) was largely responsible (the colloquial names &quot;Bobby&quot; and &quot;Peeler&quot; derive from his name Robert and Peel), and the Irish Constabulary Act 1822 formed the provincial constabularies. The 1822 act established a force in each province with chief constables and inspectors general under the UK civil administration for Ireland controlled by the Dublin Castle administration. By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men. The original force had been reorganised under an act of Parliament of 1836, and the first constabulary code of regulations was published in 1837. The discipline was strict and the pay low. The police faced civil unrest among the Irish rural poor, and was involved in bloody confrontations during the period of the Tithe War. Other deployments were against organisations like the Ribbonmen, which attacked landlords, their property and stock.

The new constabulary first demonstrated its efficiency against civil agitation and Irish separatism during Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s 1843 &quot;monster meetings&quot; to urge repeal of the Act of Parliamentary Union, and the Young Ireland campaign led by William Smith O&#x27;Brien in 1848, although it failed to contain violence at the so-called &quot;Battle of Dolly&#x27;s Brae&quot; in 1849 (which provoked a Party Processions Act to regulate sectarian demonstrations). This was followed by a period of relative calm.

The advent of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, founded in 1858, brought a plan for an armed uprising. Direct action began with the Fenian Rising of 1867. Fenians attacked on the more isolated police barracks and smaller stations. This rebellion was put down with ruthless efficiency. The police had infiltrated the Fenians with informers. The success of the Irish Constabulary during the outbreak was rewarded by Queen Victoria who granted the force the prefix &#x27;Royal&#x27; in 1867 and the right to use the insignia of the Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick in their motif. The RIC presided over a marked decline in general crime around the country. The unstable rural unrest of the early nineteenth century characterised by secret organisations and unlawful armed assembly was effectively controlled. Policing generally became a routine of controlling misdemeanours such as moonshine distilling, public drunkenness, minor theft, and wilful property crimes.A Land War broke out in the 1879–82 Depression period, causing some general unrest.

In Belfast, with its industrial boom, the working population mushroomed, growing fivefold in fifty years. Much of the increase arose from Catholic migration and there were serious sectarian riots in 1857, 1864, 1872 and 1886. As a result, the small Belfast Town Police civic force was disbanded and responsibility for policing passed to the RIC. Likewise in 1870, the RIC took over the duties of the Londonderry Borough Police.

During the 1907 Belfast Dock strike which was called by trade union leader Jim Larkin, a portion of the RIC went on strike after Constable William Barrett was suspended for his refusal to escort a traction engine driven by a blackleg carter. About 70% of the police force in Belfast declared their support of the strikers and were encouraged by Larkin to carry out their own strike for higher wages and a better pension. It never came to fruition, however, as dissident policemen were transferred out of Belfast four days before the strike was to begin. Barrett and six other constables were dismissed and extra British Army troops were deployed to Belfast. The dock strike ended on 28 August 1907.

The RIC&#x27;s existence was increasingly troubled by the rise of the Home Rule campaign in the early twentieth century period prior to World War I. Sir Neville Chamberlain was appointed Inspector-General in 1900. His years in the RIC coincided with the rise of a number of political, cultural and sporting organisations with the common aim of asserting Ireland&#x27;s separateness from England. The potential success of the third Home Rule Bill in 1912 introduced serious tensions: opponents of the Bill organised the Ulster Volunteer Force in January 1913 while supporters formed the Irish Volunteers in response. These two groups had over 250,000 members, organised as effective private armies. In reports to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Augustine Birrell, and the Under-Secretary, Sir Matthew Nathan, Chamberlain warned that the Irish Volunteers were preparing to stage an insurrection and proclaim Irish independence. However, in April 1916 when Nathan showed him a letter from the army commander in the south of Ireland telling of an expected landing of arms on the southwest coast and a rising planned for Easter, they were both &#x27;doubtful whether there was any foundation for the rumour&#x27;. The Easter Rising began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916 and lasted for six days, ending only when much of O&#x27;Connell Street had been destroyed by artillery fire. Although the Royal Commission on the 1916 Rebellion cleared the RIC of any blame for the Rising, Chamberlain had already resigned his post, along with Birrell and Nathan.

==Characteristics==

During the early 19th century in the United Kingdom, both the idea of police and the word itself were &quot;disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression&quot;. Accordingly, the state was later than its European neighbours in developing organised police services: the Metropolitan Police in London was not established until seven years after the RIC. The RIC was as a result pulled in two directions. To some extent it had a quasi-military or gendarmerie ethos: barracks and carbines; a marked class distinction between officers and men; jurisdiction over rural districts lacking a population density to warrant their own civilian police force; obligatory service outside of one&#x27;s region of origin; plus a dark green uniform with black buttons and insignia, resembling that of the rifle regiments of the British Army. At the time of the RIC&#x27;s disbanding the debate over its very nature was ongoing: a paramilitary police in the gendarme-style, or merely an armed version of the English-style civilian police? A delegation of prominent Irish-Americans led by former Illinois governor Edward F. Dunne, returned with the following impression:&quot;The Constabulary is a branch of the Military forces. They are armed with rifles, as well as small side-arms; engage in regular drills as well as small warfare&quot;; the authorities in Dublin Castle conceded that the Constabulary was armed and drilled, but considered that its operational independence from the ministry of war rendered it not a true gendarme force (note, however, that this was true of gendarmeries of other European countries, which also operated under the aegis of their national Interior ministry rather than their War ministry, other than in periods of invasion). French military observers similarly reported on the &quot;Royal Irish Constabulary (the Irish gendarmerie)&quot;.

However, the RIC also followed civic police forces in the rest of the UK in using non-military ranks such as &quot;constable&quot; and &quot;inspector&quot;; and there was a gesture towards &quot;policing by consent&quot; through attempts to match postings to the religious affiliation of the communities affected.

The RIC was an all-male police force. For most of its history, its ethnic and religious makeup broadly matched that of the Irish population (about three-quarters Catholic and one-quarter Protestant), although Anglo-Irish Protestants were overrepresented among its senior officers.

==Historical development==
Enforcement of eviction orders in rural Ireland caused the RIC to be widely distrusted by the poor Catholic population as the mid 19th century approached, but the relative calm of the late Victorian and Edwardian periods brought it increasing, if grudging, respect. From the 1850s the RIC performed a range of civil and local government duties together with their policing, integrating the constables with their local communities. In rural areas their attention was largely on minor problems such as distilling, cockfighting, drunk and disorderly behaviour, and unlicensed dogs or firearms, with only occasional attendance at evictions or on riot duty; and arrests tended to be relatively rare events. Despite their status as an armed force, constables seldom carried guns, only waist belt, handcuffs and baton. Often, along with the priest, they would have an informal leadership role in the community, and being literate would be appealed to by people needing help with forms and letters. While &quot;barracks&quot; in cities resembled those of the British Army, the term was also used for small country police stations consisting of a couple of ordinary houses with a day-room and a few bedrooms; premises would be rented by the authorities from landowners and might be changed between different sites in a village. Their pay was low, it being assumed by the authorities that they would get milk, eggs, butter and potatoes as gifts from local people. By 1901 there were around 1,600 barracks and some 11,000 constables.

The majority of constables in rural areas were drawn from the same social class, religion and general background as their neighbours. Measures were taken, not always successfully, to maintain an arms-length relationship between police and public. Constables in charge of police stations were required to make regular reports to their superiors, and would from time to time be moved around the district to prevent acquaintanceships from developing too closely. A constable was not permitted to marry until he had been in the force for some years, and was not supposed to serve in his home county, nor in that of his wife.

During the 1913 Lockout RIC were brought in to support the Dublin Metropolitan Police in guarding blacklegs and controlling public meetings. On 31 August 1913 at 1.30pm the DMP and RIC rioted in O&#x27;Connell Street, attacking what they thought was a crowd come to hear the Trade unionist Jim Larkin speak. Their intelligence was flawed; although Larkin did arrive, smuggled into the Imperial Hotel owned by the main Lockout employer by Nellie Gifford, and some ITGWU union supporters were present, the crowd waiting for Larkin was 2 kilometres away in Croydon Park; the people they baton-charged were mainly those returning home from Mass. Two trade unionists, John Byrne and James Nolan, were beaten to death and from 400 to 600 people were injured. The RIC and the formerly respected DMP largely lost the support of the middle classes when photographs of the streets were published and police actions were revealed in the subsequent inquiry, in which MP Handel Booth said that the police, &quot;behaved like men possessed&quot;.

== Irish War of Independence ==

The Sinn Féin triumph in the general election of 1918 (the coupon election), winning 73 out of the 105 Irish seats, was followed by the Sinn Féin members&#x27; decision to convene themselves as the First Dáil, a new parliament. This body first met at the Mansion House, Dublin, on 21 January 1919, and announced a unilateral declaration of independence. This created a dramatically new political reality in Ireland. Of the 17,000 policemen in Ireland, 513 were killed by the IRA between 1919 and 1921 while 682 were wounded. The vast majority of the men serving in the RIC in 1919 were Irish-born and raised. Of the RIC&#x27;s senior officers in 1919, 60% were Irish Protestants and rest Catholic while 70% of the rank and file of the RIC were Roman Catholic with the rest Protestant. The RIC was trained for police work, not war, and was woefully ill-prepared to take on the counter-insurgency duties that were required in 1919.

On the day the new parliament first met, two RIC constables, James McDonnell and Patrick O&#x27;Connell, were killed when the Soloheadbeg Ambush was carried out by a group of volunteers from the Third Tipperary Brigade of the Irish Republican Army, while on duty guarding gelignite in transit to the local mines in South Tipperary. This event marked the beginning of the Irish War of Independence. The Irish Republican Army under the leadership of Michael Collins began systematic attacks on British government forces. While the British Army controlled the cities of Ireland, the RIC bore the brunt of such assaults in the provinces. The RIC were especially targeted because of their role as local representatives of and intelligence gatherers for the British administration.

From the autumn of 1919 onwards, the RIC was forced to abandon its smaller barracks in isolated areas. A national personal boycott of members of the force was declared by the IRA. The Dáil Courts and alternative legal enforcement units were set up by republicans. RIC members were threatened, and many were attacked, leading to substantial resignations from the force (see figures below). In October 1920, RIC wages were increased to compensate for increased hardship and cost of living increases. In rural areas, many small shopkeepers refused to serve the RIC, forcing them to obtain their food and other necessities from miles away.

By October 1920, according to UK government sources, 117 RIC members had been killed and 185 wounded. Over a three-month period during the same year, 600 RIC men resigned from the force of 9,500. In the first quarter of 1920, 500 police barracks and huts in outlying areas were evacuated. The IRA had destroyed over 400 of these by the end of June to prevent their subsequent reuse.

The consequence of this was the removal of RIC authority in many outlying areas. This allowed the IRA to assert political control over these areas. Large houses were burned, often to punish their owners for allowing them to be used for policing or military purposes or as revenge for the government-backed burning of republican homes. Much of the country&#x27;s rich architectural heritage was destroyed.

To reinforce the much reduced and demoralised police the United Kingdom government recruited returned World War I veterans from English and Scottish cities. They were sent to Ireland in 1920, to form a police reserve unit which became known as the &quot;Black and Tans&quot; and the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary. Paddy O&#x27;Shea, the son of a regular RIC sergeant, described these reinforcements as being &quot;both a plague and a Godsend. They brought help but frightened even those they had come to help&quot;. Some regular RIC men resigned in protest at the often brutal and undisciplined behaviour of the new recruits; others suffered crises of conscience which troubled them for the rest of their lives. In February 1921 the British Prime Minister Lloyd George notified Hamar Greenwood (the Chief Secretary for Ireland) that he was &quot;not at all satisfied with the discipline of the Royal Irish Constabulary and its auxiliary force.&quot;

Some RIC officers co-operated with the IRA, either out of political conviction, fear for their lives and welfare, or a combination of both. A raid on an RIC barracks in Cookstown, County Tyrone, in June 1920, was carried out with the help of sympathetic RIC men. The barracks in Schull, County Cork, was captured with similar inside aid. The IRA even had spies within the upper echelon at Dublin Castle.

The Government of Ireland Act, enacted in December 1920, came into force on 3 May 1921, partitioning Ireland into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. However, continuing unrest led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the establishment of the Irish Free State.

==Disbandment==

In January 1922 the British and Irish delegations agreed to disband the RIC. Phased disbandments began within a few weeks with RIC personnel both regular and auxiliary being withdrawn to six centres in southern Ireland. On 2 April 1922 the force formally ceased to exist, although the actual process was not completed until August that year. The RIC was replaced by the Civic Guard (renamed as the the following year) in the Irish Free State and by the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.

According to a parliamentary answer in October 1922 1,330 ex-RIC men joined the new RUC in Northern Ireland. This resulted in an RUC force that was 21% Roman Catholic at its inception in 1922. As the former RIC members retired over the subsequent years this proportion steadily fell.

Just 13 men transferred to the . These included men who had earlier assisted IRA operations in various ways. Some retired, and the Irish Free State paid their pensions as provided for in the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty agreement. Others, still faced with threats of violent reprisals, emigrated with their families to Great Britain or other parts of the Empire, most often to join police forces in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. A number of these men joined the Palestine Gendarmerie, which was recruiting in the UK at this time.

<text>Danegeld (; &quot;Danish tax&quot;, literally &quot;Dane yield&quot; or tribute) was a tax raised to pay tribute or protection money to the Viking raiders to save a land from being ravaged. It was called the &quot;geld&quot; or &quot;gafol&quot; in eleventh-century sources. It was characteristic of royal policy in both England and Francia during the ninth through eleventh centuries, collected both as tributary, to buy off the attackers, and as stipendiary, to pay the defensive forces. The term &quot;Danegeld&quot; did not appear until the late eleventh century. In Anglo-Saxon England tribute payments to the Danes was known as &quot;gafol&quot; and the levy raised to support the standing army, for the defence of the realm, was known as &quot;heregeld&quot; (army-tax).

==England==
In England, a hide was notionally an area of land sufficient to support one family; however their true size and economic value varied enormously. The hide&#x27;s purpose was as a unit of assessment and was the basis for the land-tax that became known as Danegeld. Initially it was levied as a tribute to buy off Viking invaders but after the Danish Conquest of 1016 it was retained as a permanent land-tax to pay for the realm&#x27;s defence.
The Viking expeditions to England were usually led by the Danish kings, but they were composed of warriors from all over Scandinavia, and they eventually brought home more than 100 tonnes of silver.

Although the tribute payments made to the Vikings, prior to the Norman Conquest, are commonly known as Danegeld, the payments were at the time actually called &quot;gafol&quot;, meaning &quot;tax&quot; or &quot;tribute&quot;. In 1012 Æthelred the Unready introduced an annual land tax to pay for a force of Scandinavian mercenaries, led by Thorkell the Tall, to help defend the realm. Following Æthelred the kings of England used the same tax collection method to fund their own standing armies; this was known as &quot;heregeld&quot; (army-tax). Heregeld was abolished by Edward the Confessor in 1051. It was the Norman administration who called the tax Danegeld.

===Anglo-Saxon era===
An English payment of 10,000 Roman pounds (3,300 kg) of silver was first made in 991 following the Viking victory at the Battle of Maldon in Essex, when Æthelred was advised by Sigeric, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the aldermen of the south-western provinces to buy off the Vikings rather than continue the armed struggle. One manuscript of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; said Olav Tryggvason led the Viking forces.

In 994 the Danes, under King Sweyn Forkbeard and Olav Tryggvason, returned and laid siege to London. They were once more bought off, and the amount of silver paid impressed the Danes with the idea that it was more profitable to extort payments from the English than to take whatever booty they could plunder.

Further payments were made in 1002, and in 1007 Æthelred bought two years peace with the Danes for 36,000 troy pounds (13,400 kg) of silver. In 1012, following the capture and murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the sack of Canterbury, the Danes were bought off with another 48,000 troy pounds (17,900 kg) of silver.

In 1016 Sweyn Forkbeard&#x27;s son, Canute, became King of England. After two years he felt sufficiently in control of his new kingdom to the extent of being able to pay off all but 40 ships of his invasion fleet, which were retained as a personal bodyguard, with a huge Danegeld of 72,000 troy pounds (26,900 kg) of silver collected nationally, plus a further 10,500 pounds (3,900 kg) of silver collected from London.
This kind of extorted tribute was not unique to England: according to Snorri Sturluson and Rimbert, Finland, Estonia and Latvia (see also Grobin, now Grobiņa) paid the same kind of tribute to the Swedes. In fact, the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; relates that the regions paying protection money extended east towards Moscow, until the Finnic and Slavic tribes rebelled and drove the Varangians overseas. Similarly, the Sami peoples were frequently forced to pay tribute in the form of pelts. A similar procedure also existed in Iberia, where the contemporary Christian states were largely supported on tribute gold from the taifa kingdoms.

It is estimated that the total amount of money paid by the Anglo-Saxons amounted to some sixty million pence, and at the farm where the runestone Sö 260 talks of a voyage in the West, a hoard of several hundred English coins was found.

===Norman era===
In southern England the Danegeld was based on hidages, an area of agricultural land sufficient to support a family, with the exception of Kent, where the unit was a sulung of four yokes, the amount of land that could be ploughed in a season by a team of oxen; in the north the typical unit was the carucate, or ploughland, equivalent to Kent&#x27;s sulung; and East Anglia was assessed by the hundred. Everywhere the tax was farmed (collected) by local sheriffs. Records of assessment and income pre-date the Norman conquest, indicating a system which James Campbell describes as &quot;old, but not unchanging&quot;. According to David Bates, it was &quot;a national tax of a kind unknown in western Europe&quot;; indeed, asserts that the national system of land taxation developed to raise the Danegeld was the first to reappear in Western Europe since the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. It was used by William the Conqueror as the principal tool for underwriting continental wars, as well as providing for royal appetites and the costs of conquest, rather than for buying-off the Viking menace. He and his successors levied the geld more frequently than the Anglo-Saxon kings, and at higher rates; the six-shilling geld of 1084 is infamous, and the geld in Ely of 1096, for example, was double its normal rate. Judith Green states that from 1110, war and the &quot;White Ship&quot; calamity led to further increases in taxation efforts. By 1130 Henry I was taxing the Danegeld annually, at two shillings on the hide. That year, according to the chronicle of John of Worcester the king promised to suspend the Danegeld for seven years, a promise renewed by Stephen at his coronation but which was afterwards broken. Henry II revived the Danegeld in 1155–1156, but 1161–1162 marks the last year the Danegeld was recorded on a pipe roll, and the tax fell into disuse.

The importance of the Danegeld to the Exchequer may be assessed by its return of about £2400 in 1129–1130, which was about ten per cent of the total (about £23,000) paid that year.

Judged by an absolute rather than a contemporary standard, there is much to criticise in the collection of the Danegeld by the early 12th century: it was based on ancient assessments of land productivity, and there were numerous privileged reductions or exemptions, granted as marks of favour that served to cast those left paying it in an &quot;unfavoured&quot; light: &quot;Exemptions were very much a matter of royal favour, and were adjusted to meet changing circumstances ... in this way Danegeld was a more flexible instrument of taxation than most historians have been prepared to allow.&quot; Henry I granted tax liberties to London in 1133, and exempted the city from taxes such as , Danegeld, and murdrum.
 From the late twelfth century, a levy on moveables, which required the consent of parliament, replaced the geld. The principle of &quot;no consent, but exemption&quot;, gave way to that of &quot;consent, but no exemption&quot;.

==Francia==

===Brittany===
That a country-wide Danegeld was ever collected in the Duchy of Brittany is uncertain. Certainly they were paid off on more than one occasion, and such payouts may have included money (besides other valuables), but the imposition of a tax on the people to pay either a stipend or a tribute is not recorded in the sources, although it is possible that some monies were raised this way. It is more likely that purely local Danegeld were raised in times of emergency. In 847 the Breton leader Nominoe was defeated three times by some Danish Vikings before finally opening negotiations with their leaders and enticing them to leave by offering them gifts, as recorded in the contemporary &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot;:

The possibility that the Danes were bought off by methods other than the raising of cash is raised by an incident in 869, recorded in the aforementioned &quot;Annales&quot; and by Regino of Prüm. In that year Salomon, King of Brittany, put an end to some pagan raids by payment of five hundred heads of cattle.

The more local type of Danegeld is exemplified by two chronologically close events in the County of Vannes. According to a record in the cartulary of Redon Abbey, the bishop Courantgenus was ransomed from Viking captivity in 854. His ransom was quite probably raised on a local level. In 855 the monks of Redon had to ransom the count, Pascwet, from a similar captivity by handing over a chalice and a paten, weighing together sixty-seven &quot;solidi&quot; in gold. Sometime later Pascwet managed to redeem the sacred vessels from the pagans, and this payment too may have been raised as a sort of Danegeld. Certainly, according to Regino of Prüm, Pascwet later (in 873) paid a stipendiary Danegeld of an undisclosed amount to hire as mercenaries some Vikings with which to harass his opponent for the ducal throne of Brittany, Vurfand, Count of Rennes.

===East Francia===
The most important Danegeld raised in East Francia was that used by Charles the Fat to end the Siege of Elsloo and convert the Viking leader Godfrid into a Christian and a Duke of Frisia (882). Local Danegeld may have been raised in the Eastern kingdom as needed, such as by one Evesa to ransom her son, Count Eberhard, at a &quot;very great price&quot; in 880, according to Regino of Prüm.

===Frisia===
The first Danegeld ever raised was collected in Frisia in 810. In that year a Danish fleet of some two hundred vessels landed in Frisia, harassing first all the coastal islands and then the mainland before defeating the Frisians in three battles. The victorious Danes then demanded a large tribute from the conquered. Soon after, a report was sent to Charlemagne, then at Aachen contemplating a campaign against the Danish king, Godfred, stating that the Frisians had already collected through taxation and paid a sum of one hundred pounds of silver. These events are recorded in the &quot;Annales regni Francorum&quot; and the &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot;, both works of Charlemagne&#x27;s court historian, Einhard, and in the separate &quot;Reichsannalen&quot; called the &quot;Annales Mettenses&quot; and the &quot;Annales Maximiniani&quot;, as well as the work of the so-called &quot;Poeta Saxo&quot;. The total sum paid out is unknown, but it was without doubt raised through taxes, as Einhard in his &quot;Vita&quot; explicitly says: &quot;And the victorious Danes imposed a tribute on the vanquished, by means of taxes one hundred pounds of silver from the Frisians is already released&quot; (&quot;Danosque victores tributum victis inposuisse, et vectigalis nomine centum libras argenti a Frisionibus iam esse solutas&quot;).

No further Danegeld was collected in Frisia until late in the reign of Louis the Pious (died 840). In 836 some Northmen, having burnt Antwerp and the marketplace at Wintla, agreed to leave on the payment of some tribute, the amount of which the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot; do not specify. In 837, either because the Frisians were unprepared or defected from their Frankish overlords, some Vikings managed to land on Walcheren, capture several counts and other leading men and kill them or hold them for ransom. They then proceeded to exact a &quot;census&quot; wherever they could, funnelling an &quot;infinite&quot; amount of money &quot;of diverse kinds&quot; into their coffers. They then moved to the mainland, where they assaulted Dorestad and extorted a tribute from the population of the region before leaving. This event is recorded in the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot;, &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot;, &quot;Annales Xantenses&quot;, and the &quot;Vita Hludowici imperatoris&quot; of Thegan of Trier. In 846, during the reign of Louis&#x27;s son Lothair I, the Vikings compelled the Frisians to collect a &quot;census&quot; to pay them off. The &quot;Bertiniani&quot; and &quot;Xantenses&quot; annals record how Lothair, though aware of the outrage, was unable to stop it, and the Vikings left Frisia laden with booty and captives.

The last recorded Danegeld raised by the Frisians was paid in 852. In that year 252 Viking ships laid anchor off the Frisian coast and demanded tribute (of what kind we do not know), which was procured. Their demands met, the Vikings left without devastating the territory, as recorded in the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot; and the &quot;Miracula sancti Bavonis&quot;, a life of Saint Bavo. That these various Viking impositions were paid by the taxation of the Frisians is made evident in a record of events in 873. In that year, according to the annals &quot;Fuldenses&quot;, &quot;Bertiniani&quot;, and &quot;Xantenses&quot;, the Viking leader Rodulf sent messengers to the Ostergau calling for tribute. The Frisians replied that they owed taxes only to their king, Louis the German, and his sons (Carloman, Louis, and Charles), and a battle ensued, in which Rodulf was killed and his troops routed. One later, tenth-century source, Dudo of Saint-Quentin&#x27;s &quot;De moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum&quot;, records that Rollo forced the Frisians to pay tribute, but this is unlikely. All the various Frisian Danegeld was purely local in nature, raised by the local leaders and the people without royal aid or approval.

===Lotharingia===
In Lotharingia the Danegeld was only collected once. In 864 Lothair II exacted four &quot;denarii&quot; from every &quot;mansus&quot; in the kingdom, as well as large number of cattle and much flour, wine, and beer. The whole amount is not recorded, nor whether it was paid as a stipend or as a tribute, but it was paid to a Viking band led by one Rodulf. It has been suggested that Lothair was imitating the example set by Charles the Bald in 860, when he hired the Vikings of Weland to attack those encamped on the island of &quot;Oscellus&quot; in the Seine. Neither the reason for Lothair&#x27;s payment nor the result is recorded in the only source to mention it, the contemporary &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot;:

Hlotharius, Hlotharii filius, de omni regno suo quattuor denarios ex omni manso colligens, summam denariorum cum multa pensione farinae atque pecorum necnon vini ac sicerae Rodulfo Normanno, Herioldi filio, ac suis locarii nomine tribuit.
There is also a story told by Dudo of Saint-Quentin in his &quot;De moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum&quot; of how Reginar Langhals was ransomed by his wife in 880 for all the gold in Hainault, but this is probably a legend.

===West Francia===
The first payment of the Danegeld to the Vikings in West Francia took place in 845 when, under Ragnar Lothbrok, they tried to attack Paris. The Viking army was bought off from destroying the city by a massive payment of nearly six tons of silver and gold bullion. In November 858 a Danegeld was being collected, probably to pay off Bjørn (Berno), who had ravaged the Seine and its district for the whole previous year (857).

In 862 two groups of Vikings—one the larger of two fleets recently forced out of the Seine by Charles the Bald, the other a fleet returning from a Mediterranean expedition—converged on Brittany, where one (the Mediterranean group) was hired by the Breton duke Salomon to ravage the Loire valley. Robert the Strong, Margrave of Neustria, captured twelve of their ships, killing all on board save a few who fled. He then opened negotiations with the former Seine Vikings, and hired them against Salomon for 6,000 pounds of silver. The purpose of this was doubtless to prevent them from entering the service of Salomon. Probably Robert had to collect a large amount in taxes to finance what was effectively a non-tributary Danegeld designed to keep the Vikings out of Neustria. The treaty between the Franks and the Vikings did not last more than a year: in 863 Salomon made peace and the Vikings, deprived of an enemy, ravaged Neustria.

==Kievan Rus==
In Kievan Rus during the rule of the Swedish &quot;Rus&quot; (from where the name Russia derives), the Slavs had to pay an annual tribute to the Vikings known as the &quot;dan&quot; from at least 859 onward. Prince Oleg, who was a relative of Rurik the Viking, after moving to Kiev, imposed a &quot;dan&quot; on the people of Novgorod of 300 &quot;griveni&quot; / per year &quot;for the preservation of peace&quot;. The payments to Kiev continued until 1054 with the death of Prince Jaroslav of Kiev. When Prince Oleg made his expedition against Constantinople in 907, he demanded that the Romans &quot;pay tribute to his men on his 2,000 ships at the rate of 12 &quot;griveni&quot; per man, 40 men reckoned to a ship&quot;. The treaty negotiated between Oleg and the Roman Emperor Leo VI the Wise committed the emperor to pay 1 &quot;grivna&quot; to every man on Oleg&#x27;s ships in exchange for going away. According to the Russian chronicles, the followers of Prince Igor in 945 : ... said to him &quot;The servants of Sveiald are adorned with weapons and fine raiment, but we are naked. Go forth with us, oh Prince, that you and we may profit thereby.” Igor heeded their words and attacked Dereva in search of tribute (&quot;dan&quot;). He demanded the previous tribute and collected by violence from the people with the assistance of his followers...

==Legacy==

===In literature===
William Shakespeare made reference to Danish tribute in &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot;, Act 3, scene 1 (King Claudius is talking of Prince Hamlet&#x27;s insanity):
Danegeld is the subject of the poem &quot;Dane-geld&quot; by Rudyard Kipling, whose most famous lines are &quot;once you have paid him the Danegeld/ You never get rid of the Dane.&quot; The poem ends thus:
Kipling&#x27;s poem was set to music by filk musician Leslie Fish on her 1991 album, &quot;The Undertaker&#x27;s Horse&quot;.

===In politics===
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;Danegeld&quot; has come to refer to a general warning and a criticism of any coercive payment, whether in money or kind. For example, as mentioned in the British House of Commons during the debate on the Belfast Agreement:
To emphasise the point, people often quote Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;Dane-Geld&quot;, especially its two most famous lines. For example, journalist Tony Parsons quoted the poem in &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, when criticising the Rome daily &quot;La Repubblica&quot; for writing &quot;Ransom was paid and that is nothing to be ashamed of&quot;, in response to the announcement that the Italian government paid $1 million for the release of two hostages in Iraq in October 2004.

In Britain the phrase is often coupled with the experience of Chamberlain&#x27;s appeasement of Hitler. On 22 July 1939, two British newspapers, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, reported that Robert Hudson of the Department of Overseas Trade had visited the German Embassy in London two days before, to meet the German Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen and Helmuth Wohlthat of the Four Year Plan organisation, to offer Germany a huge loan worth hundreds of millions of pound sterling in exchange for not attacking Poland. The media reaction to Hudson&#x27;s proposed loan was overwhelmingly negative with the newspapers calling Hudson&#x27;s plan &quot;paying the Danegeld&quot;. Much to Hudson&#x27;s humiliation, Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that Hudson was acting on his own, and Britain would not offer Germany any such loan as a solution to the Danzig crisis.

<text>A stunt is an unusual, difficult, dramatic physical feat that may require a special skill, performed for artistic purposes usually for a public audience, as on television or in theaters or cinema. Stunts are a feature of many action films. Before computer-generated imagery special effects, these depictions were limited to the use of models, false perspective and other in-camera effects, unless the creator could find someone willing to carry them out, even such dangerous acts as jumping from car to car in motion or hanging from the edge of a skyscraper: the stunt performer or stunt double.

==Types of stunt effects==
===Practical effects===
One of the most-frequently used practical stunts is stage combat. Although contact is normally avoided, many elements of stage combat, such as sword fighting, martial arts, and acrobatics required contact between performers in order to facilitate the creation of a particular effect, such as noise or physical interaction. Stunt performances are highly choreographed and may be rigorously rehearsed for hours, days and sometimes weeks before a performance. Seasoned professionals will commonly treat a performance as if they have never done it before, since the risks in stunt work are high, every move and position must be correct to reduce risk of injury from accidents. Examples of practical effects include tripping and falling down, high jumps, extreme sporting moves, acrobatics and high diving, spins, gainer falls, &quot;suicide backflips,&quot; and other martial arts stunts. Stunt airbags (or &quot;stunt mats&quot;), large deep airbags that may be the size of a small swimming pool, are typically used by professional stunt performers to cushion their landings from staged falls from heights.
===Mechanical effects===
A physical stunt is usually performed with help of mechanics. For example, if the plot requires the hero to jump to a high place, the film crew could put the actor in a special harness, and use aircraft high tension wire to pull them up. Piano wire is sometimes used to fly objects, but an actor is never suspended from it as it is brittle and can break under shock impacts. &quot;Hero&quot; (2003) and &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004) are examples of wuxia films that use kung-fu and are heavily reliant on wire stunts. The Matrix is an example of extensive wire and rigging work in Western cinema.

===Vehicular stunts===
Performers of vehicular stunts require extensive training and may employ specially adapted vehicles. Stunts can be as simple as a handbrake turn, also known as the bootleg turn, or as advanced as car chases, jumps and crashes involving dozens of vehicles. Rémy Julienne is a well known pioneering automotive stunt performer and coordinator. A Guinness Book of World Records holder stunt driver, Bobby Ore, performed in numerous movies and events and holds a world record for longest distance driven on two wheels in a London double decker bus (810 feet).
Aviation stunts go back to those performed in balloons in the 18th century. After the advent of powered aircraft in 1903, barnstorming and aerobatics came into existence. Ormer Locklear invented or helped develop many of the basic tricks of stunt flying, which included wing walking and transferring between airplanes in mid-air. Hollywood and the public&#x27;s fascination with aviation made great demands on stunt pilots, resulting in many injuries and fatalities.

===Computer-generated effects===
In the late 20th century stunt men were often placed in dangerous situations less and less as filmmakers turned to relatively inexpensive (and much safer) computer graphics effects using harnesses, fans, blue- or green screens, and a huge array of other devices and digital effects. &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) is an example of a film that extensively enhanced real stunts through CGI post production. The &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film series and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel films often display stunts that are entirely computer generated. Examples of computer-generated effects include face replacement and wire removal.

==Hong Kong action cinema==
In 1982, Jackie Chan began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences in &quot;Dragon Lord&quot;, which featured a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes required for a single scene, with 2900 takes, and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground. In 1983, &quot;Project A&quot; saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and slapstick humor (at one point, Chan falls from the top of a clock tower through a series of fabric canopies).

&quot;Police Story&quot; (1985) contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a car chase through a shanty town, Chan stopping a double-decker bus with his service revolver and a climactic fight scene in a shopping mall. This final scene earned the film the nickname &quot;Glass Story&quot; by the crew, due to the huge number of panes of sugar glass that were broken. During a stunt in this last scene, in which Chan slides down a pole from several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably, resulting in Chan suffering second-degree burns, particularly to his hands, as well as a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon landing. Chan performed similarly elaborate stunts in numerous other films, such as several &quot;Police Story&quot; sequels, &quot;Project A Part II&quot;, the &quot;Armor of God&quot; series, &quot;Dragons Forever&quot;, &quot;Drunken Master II&quot;, and &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; among others.
Other Hong Kong action movie stars who became known for performing elaborate stunts include Chan&#x27;s Peking Opera School friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, as well as &quot;girls with guns&quot; stars such as Michelle Yeoh and Moon Lee. Other Asian cinema stars also known for performing elaborate stunts include Thai actor Tony Jaa; Indonesian actors Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian; and Indian actors Jayan, Akshay Kumar, Vidyut Jammwal and Tiger Shroff.

==Stunts that have gone wrong==
==Recognition of stunt performers==
Films such as &quot;Hooper&quot; and &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; and the 1980s television show &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; sought to raise the profile of the stunt performer and debunk the myth that film stars perform all their own stunts. Noted stunt coordinators Hal Needham, Craig R. Baxley, and Vic Armstrong went on to direct the action films &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, &quot;Action Jackson&quot;, and &quot;Joshua Tree&quot;. Vic Armstrong became the first stuntman to win both an Academy Award (for developing a descender rig as a safe alternative to airbags) and a BAFTA award (for lifetime achievement in film). But the status of stuntmen in Hollywood is still low; despite the fact that few films of any genre or type could be made without them, stunt performers are still perceived as working mainly in action films. Repeated campaigns for a &quot;Best Stunts&quot; Academy Award have been rejected.

In 2001, the first &quot;World Stunt Awards&quot; were presented in Los Angeles by actor Alec Baldwin. The event had A-list stars presenting the statues to Hollywood&#x27;s stunt performers. Arnold Schwarzenegger was presented with the first &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; award. He presented the awards in 2001. The awards show hands out eight awards: Best Fight, Best Fire Stunt, Best High Work, Best Overall Stunt by a Stunt Man, Best Overall Stunt by a Stunt Woman, Best Speciality Stunt, Best Work with a Vehicle and Best Stunt Coordinator or 2nd Unit Director.

==Equality in stunts==

In past Hollywood films it was common for men to double for women and white American stunt performers to double for African American performers, in a practice known as &quot;wigging&quot;. Veteran stunt man Dave Sharpe, a man of shorter than average height, often doubled for women in film serials of the 1930s and &#x27;40s. Veteran stunt performer Jeannie Epper, who doubled for Lynda Carter in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, explained that the situation improved in the 1970s as actresses did not want to be doubled by men, and could be more convincingly doubled by a woman. SAG-AFTRA union rules for stunt performers say that to double an actor of a different gender or race the stunt must be so dangerous that there are no volunteers available of the appropriate gender or race. For example, in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, stuntman B.J. Worth doubled for the black Jamaican actress Grace Jones whose character parachuted off the Eiffel Tower.

==The future of stunt work==

A backlash against dangerous stunts followed the fatal 42-foot backward fall of Sonja Davis off a building on the set of &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;. Despite speculation that developments in computer-generated imagery (CGI) would make stunts unnecessary and reduce stunt performers to the status of body doubles, stunt work has increasingly been made safer and enhanced by CGI effects; nevertheless, stunt performers remain essential to provide a human quality to the action.

<doc id="212090" wikidata="Q1216760" url="?curid=212090" title="Young Bess">
<text>Young Bess is a 1953 Technicolor biographical film made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer about the early life of Elizabeth I, from her turbulent childhood to the eve of her accession to the throne of England. It stars Jean Simmons as Elizabeth and Stewart Granger as Thomas Seymour, with Charles Laughton as Elizabeth&#x27;s father, Henry VIII, a part he had played 20 years before in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;. The film was directed by George Sidney and produced by Sidney Franklin, from a screenplay by and Arthur Wimperis based on the novel of the same title by Margaret Irwin (1944).

==Plot==
Following the execution of Elizabeth&#x27;s mother, Anne Boleyn, for infidelity, King Henry VIII declares his daughter illegitimate, removes her from the line of succession to the throne, and exiles her to Hatfield House. Joining her in Hatfield are her loyal servants, governess Mrs. Ashley and Mr. Parry. Over the years, her position rises and falls according to the whims of her father. The child is periodically summoned to return to London to become acquainted with Henry&#x27;s latest spouse.

When Henry marries his last wife, Catherine Parr, the now-teenage Elizabeth rebels against her latest summons but is persuaded by the handsome, tactful Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour to change her mind. She and Catherine become good friends. Henry is impressed and amused by the resolute defiance of his daughter, and he declares her once again a legitimate heiress to the crown.

When Henry dies, Thomas&#x27;s scheming brother Ned takes over as Lord Protector and guardian of the child king Edward VI, Elizabeth&#x27;s half-brother, overriding Henry&#x27;s dying wish that Thomas raise the boy. Ned&#x27;s fear of his brother&#x27;s ambition grows with each of Thomas&#x27;s naval triumphs. In the meantime, Elizabeth realizes she is in love with Thomas, but graciously persuades Edward to issue a royal decree sanctioning the marriage of Thomas and Catherine. Despite the union, Thomas grows close to Elizabeth without realizing it until he witnesses Elizabeth being kissed by Barnaby, a courtier. Prompted by jealousy, Thomas kisses Elizabeth, who declares her love for him. Catherine, who has noticed the closeness between her husband and Elizabeth, asks Elizabeth to make a choice, and the princess moves back to Hatfield. Soon after, Catherine sickens and dies.

After months away at sea, Thomas returns and finally sees Elizabeth. Ned has him arrested and charged with treason. He also accuses Elizabeth of plotting with Thomas to overthrow her brother. She goes to see Edward, but is too late to save Thomas from execution. The film then shifts forward to 1558. Having survived the perils of her early life, and with Edward deceased and her elder sister Mary dying, Elizabeth is about to become Queen of England.

==Cast==


==Production==
===Original novel===
The novel was published in 1944 in Britain and in 1945 in the U.S. It became a best seller.

===Development===
MGM bought the rights to the novel in February 1945. Katherine Anne Porter and Jan Lustig signed to write the script, and Sidney Franklin was producer. Eventually a script by Lustig and Arthur Wimperis was finished in 1946 and Franklin said &quot;we were full of enthusiasm for it.&quot; In May 1947, Deborah Kerr was tested for the lead role.

In March 1948, MGM announced it would make the film in Britain. It was to be the second in a series of films made there, following &quot;Edward, My Son&quot;. In May 1948, MGM stated that Deborah Kerr and Errol Flynn were &quot;definite&quot; for the film. However filming did not proceed.

In August 1948, Walter Pidgeon and Janet Leigh reportedly were tested for lead roles. Elizabeth Taylor was considered for the title role as was Deborah Kerr (if it was going to be the latter the character would be aged up). In November 1948, MGM put the film on its schedule for the following year. However, filming kept being postponed. In April 1949, MGM announced it was negotiating a contract with James Mason, whom it wanted to put in &quot;Young Bess&quot; and &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

In December 1950, Jean Simmons emerged as a favorite to play the title role. This was partly at the behest of J. Arthur Rank who had Simmons under contract and thought the role would be perfect for her. In February 1951, MGM announced Simmons would co-star with her husband Stewart Granger. Filming continued to be pushed back in part because Simmons became enmeshed in a contractual dispute with Howard Hughes. In October 1951, Charles Laughton signed to play Henry VIII. In August 1952, Deborah Kerr joined the cast as Catherine Parr.

===Filming===
Filming took place in Hollywood starting in October 1952. Producer Sidney Franklin said:

We&#x27;re telling an intimate story against a background of sixteenth century court life, as opposed to a historical pageant about royal intrigues. We feel the love story between the Princess and Seymour – actually he was 25 years older than Elizabeth – will be more valid to audiences than a lot of historical detail which has no relation to our customers lives.

The musical score was composed by Miklós Rózsa, who was becoming known for his research on historical subjects. It incorporates tunes from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and other Tudor sources.

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were positive. A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a favorable review that &quot;if faint strains of soap opera occasionally filter through the pomp and circumstance, Elizabeth of England and some of the storied figures who crowd this beautiful Technicolored tapestry, emerge as human beings.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a remarkably engrossing motion picture&quot; and &quot;a human story, sensitively written, directed and played.&quot; &quot;A strong romantic costume drama&quot;, declared &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;. &quot;The direction is faultless, the production values lavish, and the color photography exquisite.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the plot &quot;may sound like a Madison Avenue concept of history, but as directed by George Sidney, the piece doesn&#x27;t churn up too much sudsy bathos to be intolerable, and, indeed, the cast goes about its work with such sincerity that you can enjoy the thing as a handsome costume exercise even though you&#x27;re skeptical about Miss Irwin&#x27;s history.&quot;

The film was Stewart Granger&#x27;s favourite of all the movies he made for MGM &quot;for the costumes, the cast, the story.&quot;

===Box office===
According to MGM records, the film earned $1,645,000 in North America and $2,450,000 in other markets, leading to a loss of $272,000.

In France, the film recorded admissions of 1,465,207.

==Awards==
The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: for Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction (Cedric Gibbons, Urie McCleary, Edwin B. Willis, Jack D. Moore).

<doc id="212094" wikidata="Q184631" url="?curid=212094" title="Ballistics">
<text>Ballistics is the field of mechanics concerned with the launching, flight behaviour and impact effects of projectiles, especially weapon munitions such as bullets, unguided bombs, rockets and the like; the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance.

A ballistic body is a free-moving body with momentum, which can be subject to forces such as those exerted by pressurized gases from a gun barrel or a propelling nozzle, normal force by rifling, and gravity and air drag during flight.

A ballistic missile is a missile that is guided only during the relatively brief initial phase of powered flight, with the trajectory subsequently governed by the laws of classical mechanics, in contrast to (for example) a cruise missile, which is aerodynamically guided in powered flight like a fixed-wing aircraft.

== History and prehistory==

The earliest known ballistic projectiles were stones, spears, and the throwing stick.

The oldest evidence of stone-tipped projectiles, which may or may not have been propelled by a bow (c.f. atlatl), dating to c. 280,000 years ago, were found in Ethiopia, present day East Africa.
The oldest evidence of the use of bows to shoot arrows dates to about 10,000 years ago; it is based on pinewood arrows found in the Ahrensburg valley north of Hamburg. They had shallow grooves on the base, indicating that they were shot from a bow. The oldest bow so far recovered is about 8,000 years old, found in the Holmegård swamp in Denmark.

Archery seems to have arrived in the Americas with the Arctic small tool tradition, about 4,500 years ago.

The first devices identified as guns appeared in China around 1000 AD, and by the 12th century the technology was spreading through the rest of Asia, and into Europe by the 13th century.

After millennia of empirical development, the discipline of ballistics was initially studied and developed by Italian mathematician Niccolò Tartaglia in 1531, although he continued to use segments of straight-line motion, conventions established by the Greek philosopher Aristotle and Albert of Saxony, but with the innovation that he connected the straight lines by a circular arc. Galileo established the principle of compound motion in 1638, using the principle to derive the parabolic form of the ballistic trajectory. Ballistics was put on a solid scientific and mathematical basis by Isaac Newton, with the publication of Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687. This gave mathematical laws of motion and gravity which for the first time made it possible to successfully predict trajectories.

The word &quot;ballistics&quot; comes from the Greek , meaning &quot;to throw&quot;.

==Projectiles==

A projectile is any object projected into space (empty or not) by the exertion of a force. Although any object in motion through space (for example a thrown baseball) is a projectile, the term most commonly refers to a weapon. Mathematical equations of motion are used to analyze projectile trajectory.

Examples of projectiles include balls, arrows, bullets, artillery shells, wingless rockets, etc.

==Projectile launchers==

===Throwing===


Throwing is the launching of a projectile by hand. Although some other animals can throw, humans are unusually good throwers due to their high dexterity and good timing capabilities, and it is believed that this is an evolved trait. Evidence of human throwing dates back 2 million years. The 90 mph throwing speed found in many athletes far exceeds the speed at which chimpanzees can throw things, which is about 20 mph. This ability reflects the ability of the human shoulder muscles and tendons to store elasticity until it is needed to propel an object.

===Sling===

A sling is a projectile weapon typically used to throw a blunt projectile such as a stone, clay or lead &quot;sling-bullet&quot;.

A sling has a small cradle or &quot;pouch&quot; in the middle of two lengths of cord. The &quot;sling stone&quot; is placed in the pouch. The middle finger or thumb is placed through a loop on the end of one cord, and a tab at the end of the other cord is placed between the thumb and forefinger. The sling is swung in an arc, and the tab released at a precise moment. This frees the projectile to fly to the target.

===Bow===

A bow is a flexible piece of material which shoots aerodynamic projectiles called arrows. The arrow is perhaps the first lethal projectile ever described in discussion of ballistics. A string joins the two ends and when the string is drawn back, the ends of the stick are flexed. When the string is released, the potential energy of the flexed stick is transformed into the velocity of the arrow. Archery is the art or sport of shooting arrows from bows.

===Catapult===

A catapult is a device used to launch a projectile a great distance without the aid of explosive devices – particularly various types of ancient and medieval siege engines. The catapult has been used since ancient times, because it was proven to be one of the most effective mechanisms during warfare. The word &quot;catapult&quot; comes from the Latin , which in turn comes from the Greek (), itself from (), &quot;against” and (), &quot;to toss, to hurl&quot;. Catapults were invented by the ancient Greeks.

===Gun===
A gun is a normally tubular weapon or other device designed to discharge projectiles or other material. The projectile may be solid, liquid, gas, or energy and may be free, as with bullets and artillery shells, or captive as with Taser probes and whaling harpoons. The means of projection varies according to design but is usually effected by the action of gas pressure, either produced through the rapid combustion of a propellant or compressed and stored by mechanical means, operating on the projectile inside an open-ended tube in the fashion of a piston. The confined gas accelerates the movable projectile down the length of the tube imparting sufficient velocity to sustain the projectile&#x27;s travel once the action of the gas ceases at the end of the tube or muzzle. Alternatively, acceleration via electromagnetic field generation may be employed in which case the tube may be dispensed with and a guide rail substituted.

A weapons engineer or armourer who applies the scientific principles of ballistics to design cartridges are often called a ballistician.

===Rocket===
A rocket is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellants carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction. Rocket engines push rockets forward simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast.

While comparatively inefficient for low speed use, rockets are relatively lightweight and powerful, capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining extremely high speeds with reasonable efficiency. Rockets are not reliant on the atmosphere and work very well in space.

Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th century China. Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology for the Space Age, including setting foot on the Moon. Rockets are now used for fireworks, weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles for artificial satellites, human spaceflight, and space exploration.

Chemical rockets are the most common type of high performance rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of rocket propellant. Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.

== Subfields ==
Ballistics is often broken down into the following four categories:
* &quot;Internal ballistics&quot; the study of the processes originally accelerating projectiles
* &quot;Transition ballistics&quot; the study of projectiles as they transition to unpowered flight
* &quot;External ballistics&quot; the study of the passage of the projectile (the trajectory) in flight
* &quot;Terminal ballistics&quot; the study of the projectile and its effects as it ends its flight

===Internal ballistics===

Internal ballistics (also interior ballistics), a sub-field of ballistics, is the study of the propulsion of a projectile.

In guns, internal ballistics covers the time from the propellant&#x27;s ignition until the projectile exits the gun barrel. The study of internal ballistics is important to designers and users of firearms of all types, from small-bore rifles and pistols, to high-tech artillery.

For rocket propelled projectiles, internal ballistics covers the period during which a rocket engine is providing thrust.

===Transitional ballistics===

Transitional ballistics, also known as intermediate ballistics, is the study of a projectile&#x27;s behavior from the time it leaves the muzzle until the pressure behind the projectile is equalized, so it lies between internal ballistics and external ballistics.

===External ballistics===

External ballistics is the part of the science of ballistics that deals with the behaviour of a non-powered projectile in flight.

External ballistics is frequently associated with firearms, and deals with the unpowered free-flight phase of the bullet after it exits the gun barrel and before it hits the target, so it lies between transitional ballistics and terminal ballistics.

However, external ballistics is also concerned with the free-flight of rockets and other projectiles, such as balls, arrows etc.

===Terminal ballistics===

Terminal ballistics is the study of the behavior and effects of a projectile when it hits its target.

Terminal ballistics is relevant both for small caliber projectiles as well as for large caliber projectiles (fired from artillery). The study of extremely high velocity impacts is still very new and is as yet mostly applied to spacecraft design.

==Applications==
=== Forensic ballistics ===

Forensic ballistics involves analysis of bullets and bullet impacts to determine information of use to a court or other part of a legal system. Separately from ballistics information, firearm and tool mark examinations (&quot;ballistic fingerprinting&quot;) involve analyzing firearm, ammunition, and tool mark evidence in order to establish whether a certain firearm or tool was used in the commission of a crime. 

=== Astrodynamics ===

Astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft. The motion of these objects is usually calculated from Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. It is a core discipline within space mission design and control.

<doc id="212096" wikidata="Q2609611" url="?curid=212096" title="Margaret de Clare">
<text>Margaret de Clare, Countess of Gloucester, Countess of Cornwall (12 October 1293 – 9 April 1342) was an English noblewoman, heiress, and the second eldest of the three daughters of Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford and his wife Joan of Acre, making her a granddaughter of King Edward I of England. Her two husbands were Piers Gaveston and Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester.

== Marriage to Piers Gaveston ==
Margaret was married to Piers Gaveston, the favourite of her uncle Edward II on 1 November 1307. At the time of her marriage, she was 14 years of age. According to the &quot;Vita Edwardi Secundi&quot;, this marriage was arranged by the King &quot;to strengthen Piers and surround him with friends&quot;. Piers Gaveston celebrated the marriage with a lavish tournament at Wallingford Castle. The marriage of such a high-born heiress to a foreigner did not please the English nobility and engendered a great deal of unpopularity. Their daughter, Joan Gaveston, was born on 12 January 1312 in York. It is alleged that they had another child named Amy Gaveston born around 1310, but there is little evidence outside of hearsay to validate this claim. There are also claims that Amy was born to a mistress of Piers Gaveston. However, the evidence is circumstantial and the official records only list Joan Gaveston as born to Piers Gaveston and Margaret de Clare.

King Edward arranged a lavish celebration after the birth of this little girl, complete with minstrels. However, Piers Gaveston was executed only six months later, leaving Margaret a widow with a small child. Her dower rights as Countess of Cornwall were disputed, and so King Edward instead assigned her Oakham Castle and other lands. She joined the royal household, and accompanied the King in his journey from London to York in 1316.

== Inheritance and second marriage ==
Following the death of their brother, Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford, at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Margaret and her sisters, Elizabeth and Eleanor de Clare received a share of the inheritance. Margaret was now one of the co-heiresses to the vast Gloucester estate, and King Edward arranged a second marriage for her to another favourite, Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester. She was High Sheriff of Rutland from 1313 to 1319. On 28 April 1317, Margaret de Clare wed Hugh de Audley at Windsor Castle. They had one daughter: Margaret Audley, born between January 1318 and November 1320.

== Despenser War ==
Hugh and Margaret were among the victims of their brother-in-law, Hugh the younger Despenser. In his rashness and greed for the Clare lands, he robbed Margaret of much of her rightful inheritance. In 1321, Hugh de Audley joined the other marcher lords in looting, burning, and causing general devastation to Despenser&#x27;s lands which subsequently became the Despenser War. Hugh was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322, and was saved from a hanging thanks to the pleas of his wife. He was imprisoned, and two months later Margaret was sent to Sempringham Priory in Lincolnshire. She remained there until 1326, when Hugh escaped prison and she was released from Sempringham.

== Countess of Gloucester ==
Hugh and Margaret were reunited sometime in 1326. In summer 1336, their only daughter, Margaret Audley, was abducted by Ralph Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford. Her parents filed a complaint, but King Edward III supported Stafford. He appeased Hugh and Margaret by creating Hugh Earl of Gloucester. Margaret was henceforth styled Countess of Gloucester.

== Death ==
Margaret died on 9 April 1342, and her sister Lady Elizabeth de Clare paid for prayers to be said for her soul at Tonbridge Priory in Kent, England, where she was buried.

<text>In vector computer graphics, CAD systems, and geographic information systems, geometric primitive (or prim) is the simplest (i.e. &#x27;atomic&#x27; or irreducible) geometric shape that the system can handle (draw, store). Sometimes the subroutines that draw the corresponding objects are called &quot;geometric primitives&quot; as well. The most &quot;primitive&quot; primitives are point and straight line segment, which were all that early vector graphics systems had.

In constructive solid geometry, primitives are simple geometric shapes such as a cube, cylinder, sphere, cone, pyramid, torus.

Modern 2D computer graphics systems may operate with primitives which are curves (segments of straight lines, circles and more complicated curves), as well as shapes (boxes, arbitrary polygons, circles).

A common set of two-dimensional primitives includes lines, points, and polygons, although some people prefer to consider triangles primitives, because every polygon can be constructed from triangles. All other graphic elements are built up from these primitives. In three dimensions, triangles or polygons positioned in three-dimensional space can be used as primitives to model more complex 3D forms. In some cases, curves (such as Bézier curves, circles, etc.) may be considered primitives; in other cases, curves are complex forms created from many straight, primitive shapes.

== Common primitives ==
The set of geometric primitives is based on the &quot;dimension&quot; of the region being represented:
* &quot;Point&quot; (0-dimensional), a single location with no height, width, or depth.
* &quot;Line&quot; or &quot;curve&quot; (1-dimensional), having length but no width, although a linear feature may curve through a higher-dimensional space.
* &quot;Planar surface&quot; or &quot;curved surface&quot; (2-dimensional), having length and width.
* &quot;Volumetric region&quot; or &quot;solid&quot; (3-dimensional), having length, width, and depth.

In GIS, the terrain surface is often spoken of colloquially as &quot;2 1/2 dimensional,&quot; because only the upper surface needs to be represented. Thus, elevation can be conceptualized as a scalar field property or function of two-dimensional space, affording it a number of data modeling efficiencies over true 3-dimensional objects. 
A shape of any of these dimensions greater than zero consists of an infinite number of distinct points. Because digital systems are finite, only a sample set of the points in a shape can be stored. Thus, vector data structures typically represent geometric primitives using a strategic sample, organized in structures that facilitate the software interpolating the remainder of the shape at the time of analysis or display, using the algorithms of Computational geometry.
* A Point is a single coordinate in a Cartesian coordinate system. Some data models allow for Multipoint features consisting of several disconnected points.

* A Polygonal chain or Polyline is an ordered list of points (termed vertices in this context). The software is expected to interpolate the intervening shape of the line between adjacent points in the list as a parametric curve, most commonly a straight line, but other types of curves are frequently available, including circular arcs, cubic splines, and Bézier curves. Some of these curves require additional points to be defined that are not on the line itself, but are used for parametric control.
* A Polygon is a polyline that closes at its endpoints, representing the boundary of a two-dimensional region. The software is expected to use this boundary to partition 2-dimensional space into an interior and exterior. Some data models allow for a single feature to consist of multiple polylines, which could collectively connect to form a single closed boundary, could represent a set of disjoint regions (e.g., the state of Hawaii), or could represent a region with holes (e.g., a lake with an island).

* A Parametric shape is a standardized two-dimensional or three-dimensional shape defined by a minimal set of parameters, such as an ellipse defined by two points at its foci, or three points at its center, vertex, and co-vertex.
* A Polyhedron or Polygon mesh is a set of polygon faces in three-dimensional space that are connected at their edges to completely enclose a volumetric region. In some applications, closure may not be required or may be implied, such as modeling terrain. The software is expected to use this surface to partition 3-dimensional space into an interior and exterior. A triangle mesh is a subtype of polyhedron in which all faces must be triangles, the only polygon that will always be planar, including the Triangulated irregular network (TIN) commonly used in GIS.

* A parametric mesh represents a three-dimensional surface by a connected set of parametric functions, similar to a spline or Bézier curve in two dimensions. The most common structure is the Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS), supported by most CAD and animation software.

== Application in GIS ==

A wide variety of vector data structures and formats have been developed during the history of Geographic information systems, but they share a fundamental basis of storing a core set of geometric primitives to represent the location and extent of geographic phenomena. Locations of points are almost always measured within a standard Earth-based coordinate system, whether the spherical Geographic coordinate system (latitude/longitude), or a planar coordinate system, such as the Universal Transverse Mercator. They also share the need to store a set of attributes of each geographic feature alongside its shape; traditionally, this has been accomplished using the data models, data formats, and even software of relational databases.

Early vector formats, such as POLYVRT, the ARC/INFO Coverage, and the Esri shapefile support a basic set of geometric primitives: points, polylines, and polygons, only in two dimensional space and the latter two with only straight line interpolation. TIN data structures for representing terrain surfaces as triangle meshes were also added. Since the mid 1990s, new formats have been developed that extend the range of available primitives, generally standardized by the Open Geospatial Consortium&#x27;s Simple Features specification. Common geometric primitive extensions include: three-dimensional coordinates for points, lines, and polygons; a fourth &quot;dimension&quot; to represent a measured attribute or time; curved segments in lines and polygons; text annotation as a form of geometry; and polygon meshes for three-dimensional objects.

Frequently, a representation of the shape of a real-world phenomenon may have a different (usually lower) dimension than the phenomenon being represented. For example, a city (a two-dimensional region) may be represented as a point, or a road (a three-dimensional volume of material) may be represented as a line. This dimensional generalization correlates with tendencies in spatial cognition. For example, asking the distance between two cities presumes a conceptual model of the cities as points, while giving directions involving travel &quot;up,&quot; &quot;down,&quot; or &quot;along&quot; a road imply a one-dimensional conceptual model. This is frequently done for purposes of data efficiency, visual simplicity, or cognitive efficiency, and is acceptable if the distinction between the representation and the represented is understood, but can cause confusion if information users assume that the digital shape is a perfect representation of reality (i.e., believing that roads really are lines).

== In 3D modelling ==

In CAD software or 3D modelling, the interface may present the user with the ability to create primitives which may be further modified by edits. For example, in the practice of box modelling the user will start with a cuboid, then use extrusion and other operations to create the model. In this use the primitive is just a convenient starting point, rather than the fundamental unit of modelling.

A 3D package may also include a list of extended primitives which are more complex shapes that come with the package. For example, a teapot is listed as a primitive in 3D Studio Max.

== In graphics hardware ==

Various graphics accelerators exist with hardware acceleration for rendering specific primitives such as lines or triangles, frequently with texture mapping and shaders. Modern 3D accelerators typically accept sequences of triangles as triangle strips.

<doc id="212101" wikidata="Q249023" url="?curid=212101" title="Diffuse sky radiation">
<text>Diffuse sky radiation is solar radiation reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface after having been scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules or particulates in the atmosphere. It is also called sky radiation, the determinative process for changing the colors of the sky. Approximately 23% of direct incident radiation of total sunlight is removed from the direct solar beam by scattering into the atmosphere; of this amount (of incident radiation) about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as photon diffused skylight radiation.

The dominant radiative scattering processes in the atmosphere are Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering; they are elastic, meaning that a photon of light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and without changing wavelength.

Under an overcast sky, there is no direct sunlight, and all light results from diffused skylight radiation.

Proceeding from analyses of the aftermath of the eruption of the Philippines volcano Mount Pinatubo (in June 1991) and other studies: Diffused skylight, owing to its intrinsic structure and behavior, can illuminate under-canopy leaves, permitting more efficient total whole-plant photosynthesis than would otherwise be the case; this in stark contrast to the effect of totally clear skies with direct sunlight that casts shadows onto understory leaves and thereby limits plant photosynthesis to the top canopy layer, (see below).

==Color==
Earth&#x27;s atmosphere scatters short-wavelength light more efficiently than that of longer wavelengths. Because its wavelengths are shorter, blue light is more strongly scattered than the longer-wavelength lights, red or green. Hence, the result that when looking at the sky away from the direct incident sunlight, the human eye perceives the sky to be blue. The color perceived is similar to that presented by a monochromatic blue (at wavelength ) mixed with white light, that is, an unsaturated blue light. The explanation of blue color by Lord Rayleigh in 1871 is a famous example of applying dimensional analysis to solving problems in physics.

Scattering and absorption are major causes of the attenuation of sunlight radiation by the atmosphere. Scattering varies as a function of the ratio of particle diameters (of particulates in the atmosphere) to the wavelength of the incident radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, Rayleigh scattering occurs. (In this case, the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger ratios scattering varies in a more complex fashion, as described for spherical particles by the Mie theory.) The laws of geometric optics begin to apply at higher ratios.

Daily at any global venue experiencing sunrise or sunset, most of the solar beam of visible sunlight arrives nearly tangentially to Earth&#x27;s surface. Here, the path of sunlight through the atmosphere is elongated such that much of the blue or green light is scattered away from the line of perceivable visible light. This phenomenon leaves the Sun&#x27;s rays, and the clouds they illuminate, abundantly orange-to-red in colors, which one sees when looking at a sunset or sunrise.

For the example of the Sun at zenith, in broad daylight, the sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering, which also involves the diatomic gases  and . Near sunset and especially during twilight, absorption by ozone () significantly contributes to maintaining blue color in the evening sky.

==Under an overcast sky==
There is essentially no direct sunlight under an overcast sky, so all light is then diffuse sky radiation. The flux of light is not very wavelength-dependent because the cloud droplets are larger than the light&#x27;s wavelength and scatter all colors approximately equally. The light passes through the translucent clouds in a manner similar to frosted glass. The intensity ranges (roughly) from of direct sunlight for relatively thin clouds down to of direct sunlight under the extreme of thickest storm clouds.

==As a part of total radiation==
One of the equations for total solar radiation is:

: formula_1

where &quot;Hb&quot; is the beam radiation irradiance, &quot;Rb&quot; is the tilt factor for beam radiation, &quot;Hd&quot; is the diffuse radiation irradiance, &quot;Rd&quot; is the tilt factor for diffuse radiation and &quot;Rr&quot; is the tilt factor for reflected radiation.

&quot;Rb&quot; is given by:

: formula_2

where &quot;δ&quot; is the solar declination, &quot;Φ&quot; is the latitude, &quot;β&quot; is an angle from the horizontal and &quot;h&quot; is the solar hour angle.

&quot;Rd&quot; is given by:

: formula_3

and &quot;Rr&quot; by:

: formula_4

where &quot;ρ&quot; is the reflectivity of the surface.

==Agriculture and the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo==
The eruption of the Philippines volcano - Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 ejected roughly of magma and &quot;17 million metric tons&quot;(17 teragrams) of sulfur dioxide SO2 into the air, introducing ten times as much total SO2 as the 1991 Kuwaiti fires, mostly during the explosive Plinian/Ultra-Plinian event of June 15, 1991, creating a global stratospheric SO2 haze layer which persisted for years. This resulted in the global average temperature dropping by about . Since volcanic ash falls out of the atmosphere rapidly, the negative agricultural, effects of the eruption were largely immediate and localized to a relatively small area in close proximity to the eruption, caused by the resulting thick ash cover. Globally however, despite a several-month 5% drop in overall solar irradiation, and a reduction in direct sunlight by 30%, there was no negative impact on global agriculture. Surprisingly, a 3-4 year increase in global Agricultural productivity and forestry growth was observed, excepting boreal forest regions. The means of discovery was that initially, a mysterious drop in the rate at which carbon dioxide (CO2) was filling the atmosphere was observed, which is charted in what is known as the &quot;Keeling Curve&quot;. This led numerous scientists to assume that the reduction was due to the lowering of Earth&#x27;s temperature, and with that, a, slowdown in plant and soil respiration, indicating a deleterious impact on global agriculture from the volcanic haze layer. However upon investigation, the reduction in the rate at which carbon dioxide filled the atmosphere did not match up with the hypothesis that plant respiration rates had declined. Instead the advantageous anomaly was relatively firmly linked to an unprecedented increase in the growth/net primary production, of global plant life, resulting in the increase of the carbon sink effect of global photosynthesis. The mechanism by which the increase in plant growth was possible, was that the 30% reduction of direct sunlight can also be expressed as an increase or &quot;enhancement&quot; in the amount of diffuse sunlight.

===The diffused skylight effect===
This diffused skylight, owing to its intrinsic nature, can illuminate under-canopy leaves permitting more efficient total whole-plant photosynthesis than would otherwise be the case, and also increasing evaporative cooling, from vegetated surfaces. In stark contrast, for totally clear skies and the direct sunlight that results from it, shadows are cast onto understorey leaves, limiting plant photosynthesis to the top canopy layer. This increase in global agriculture from the volcanic haze layer also naturally results as a product of other aerosols that are not emitted by volcanoes, such, &quot;moderately thick smoke loading&quot; pollution, as the same mechanism, the &quot;aerosol direct radiative effect&quot; is behind both.

<doc id="212103" wikidata="Q14956958" url="?curid=212103" title="My Night with Reg">
<text>My Night with Reg is a play by British playwright Kevin Elyot which was produced in 1994 by the Royal Court Theatre, London, directed by Roger Michell. The production later transferred to the West End.

Entirely set among London&#x27;s gay community in the mid-1980s against the background of the mounting AIDS crisis, &quot;My Night with Reg&quot; follows the ups and downs of a circle of gay friends over a period of several years. One of the group, the Reg mentioned in the title, is not a character in the play but the whole plot revolves around his apparent promiscuity and the chain reaction of deception and betrayal set off by it.

==Plot summary==
All three scenes are set in the sitting room of Guy&#x27;s London apartment: during Guy&#x27;s flatwarming party (Scene 1); after Reg&#x27;s funeral, some years later (Scene 2); and after Guy&#x27;s funeral (Scene 3).

The group, most of them in their thirties, meet at irregular intervals, often at Guy&#x27;s place. Guy himself is a lonely man. Ever since their university days, he has had a crush on John, but he has never dared to tell him about it. Rather, he lives a solitary life, which he only spices up with phone sex and an occasional visit to a gay pub – that is where he meets 18-year-old Eric, who then helps him decorate his new flat. On holiday on the island of Lanzarote, he meets a gay man who eventually forces himself on Guy and has unprotected sex with him. At his flatwarming party, he has just come back from his holiday and is still quite shocked about what happened. It is hard for him not to start crying when, as a present, John gives him a cookery book specialising in dishes for one.

The most popular of the gay circle is Reg, who is conspicuously absent from the party. Reg has had a long-term relationship with Daniel, but Daniel himself suspects Reg of occasionally being unfaithful to him. In fact Reg seems to be sleeping with every man he can get hold of (as it seems, even with the vicar). In the course of the play, John, Benny and even his seemingly faithful companion Bernie have secret sex with Reg. They all confide in Guy. It hurts Guy most to hear that John – whom he himself fancies – is having an affair with Reg, thus betraying their mutual friend Daniel. After his fling with Reg, Benny panics because he thinks he might have contracted HIV, but he does not confess it to his partner, Bernie.

When Reg is dying from AIDS, he is looked after by his partner, Daniel. The next one to die is Guy, the only one who has not had sex with Reg and who seems to have been infected with HIV when he was raped during his holiday in Lanzarote. Guy bequeaths his new flat to the love of his life, John who does not need it at all because he comes from a rich background. It is John who, somewhere in the flat, finds all kinds of memorabilia dating back to their student days.

The play serves as a &quot;tip of the hat&quot; to iconic musician Sir Elton John, with the names of all the characters being part of Eltoniana: Reg (Elton&#x27;s birth name); Daniel, Benny, Guy (all from Elton John hit songs), John (the singer&#x27;s appropriated surname, his homage to Long John Baldry), and Bernie (the Christian name of Elton&#x27;s longtime lyricist, Bernie Taupin). Eric may be a reference to Eric Clapton, with whom John toured in 1992. Daniel gives Guy a recipe book by a Gertrude Pinner, a reference to the town in which Elton John grew up.

<doc id="212115" wikidata="Q2704791" url="?curid=212115" title="Enumeration">
<text>An enumeration is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection. The term is commonly used in mathematics and computer science to refer to a listing of all of the elements of a set. The precise requirements for an enumeration (for example, whether the set must be finite, or whether the list is allowed to contain repetitions) depend on the discipline of study and the context of a given problem.

Some sets can be enumerated by means of a natural ordering (such as 1, 2, 3, 4, ... for the set of positive integers), but in other cases it may be necessary to impose a (perhaps arbitrary) ordering. In some contexts, such as enumerative combinatorics, the term &quot;enumeration&quot; is used more in the sense of &quot;counting&quot; – with emphasis on determination of the number of elements that a set contains, rather than the production of an explicit listing of those elements.

== Combinatorics ==
In combinatorics, enumeration means counting, i.e., determining the exact number of elements of finite sets, usually grouped into infinite families, such as the family of sets each consisting of all permutations of some finite set. There are flourishing subareas in many branches of mathematics concerned with enumerating in this sense. For instance, in &quot;partition enumeration&quot; and &quot;graph enumeration&quot; the objective is to count partitions or graphs that meet certain conditions.

== Set theory ==

In set theory, the notion of enumeration has a broader sense, and does not require the set being enumerated to be finite.

===Listing===

When an enumeration is used in an ordered list context, we impose some sort of ordering structure requirement on the index set. While we can make the requirements on the ordering quite lax in order to allow for great generality, the most natural and common prerequisite is that the index set be well-ordered. According to this characterization, an ordered enumeration is defined to be a surjection (an onto relationship) with a well-ordered domain. This definition is natural in the sense that a given well-ordering on the index set provides a unique way to list the next element given a partial enumeration.

===Countable vs. uncountable===

Unless otherwise specified, an enumeration is done by means of natural numbers. That is, an &quot;enumeration&quot; of a set is a bijective function from the natural numbers formula_1 or an initial segment of the natural numbers to .

A set is countable if it can be enumerated, that is, if there exists an enumeration of it. Otherwise, it is uncountable. For example, the set of the real numbers is uncountable.

A set is finite if it can be enumerated by means of a proper initial segment of the natural numbers, in which case, its cardinality is . The empty set is finite, as it can be enumerated by means of the empty initial segment of the natural numbers.

The term set is sometimes used for countable sets. However it is also often used for computably enumerable sets, which are the countable sets for which an enumeration function can be computed with an algorithm.

For avoiding to distinguish between finite and countably infinite set, it is often useful to use another definition that is equivalent: A set is countable if and only if there exists an injective function from it into the natural numbers.

==== Examples ====
==== Properties ====

* There exists an enumeration for a set (in this sense) if and only if the set is countable.
* If a set is enumerable it will have an uncountable infinity of different enumerations, except in the degenerate cases of the empty set or (depending on the precise definition) sets with one element. However, if one requires enumerations to be injective &quot;and&quot; allows only a limited form of partiality such that if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is defined then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) must be defined for all &quot;m&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, then a finite set of &quot;N&quot; elements has exactly &quot;N&quot;! enumerations.
* An enumeration &quot;e&quot; of a set &quot;S&quot; with domain formula_1 induces a well-order ≤ on that set defined by &quot;s&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot; if and only if formula_3. Although the order may have little to do with the underlying set, it is useful when some order of the set is necessary.

=== Ordinals ===

In set theory, there is a more general notion of an enumeration than the characterization requiring the domain of the listing function to be an initial segment of the Natural numbers where the domain of the enumerating function can assume any ordinal. Under this definition, an enumeration of a set &quot;S&quot; is any surjection from an ordinal α onto &quot;S&quot;. The more restrictive version of enumeration mentioned before is the special case where α is a finite ordinal or the first limit ordinal ω. This more generalized version extends the aforementioned definition to encompass transfinite listings.

Under this definition, the first uncountable ordinal formula_4 can be enumerated by the identity function on formula_4 so that these two notions do not coincide. More generally, it is a theorem of ZF that any well-ordered set can be enumerated under this characterization so that it coincides up to relabeling with the generalized listing enumeration. If one also assumes the Axiom of Choice, then all sets can be enumerated so that it coincides up to relabeling with the most general form of enumerations.

Since set theorists work with infinite sets of arbitrarily large cardinalities, the default definition among this group of mathematicians of an enumeration of a set tends to be any arbitrary α-sequence exactly listing all of its elements. Indeed, in Jech&#x27;s book, which is a common reference for set theorists, an enumeration is defined to be exactly this. Therefore, in order to avoid ambiguity, one may use the term finitely enumerable or denumerable to denote one of the corresponding types of distinguished countable enumerations.

=== Comparison of cardinalities ===

Formally, the most inclusive definition of an enumeration of a set &quot;S&quot; is any surjection from an arbitrary index set &quot;I&quot; onto &quot;S&quot;. In this broad context, every set &quot;S&quot; can be trivially enumerated by the identity function from &quot;S&quot; onto itself. If one does &quot;not&quot; assume the axiom of choice or one of its variants, &quot;S&quot; need not have any well-ordering. Even if one does assume the axiom of choice, &quot;S&quot; need not have any natural well-ordering.

This general definition therefore lends itself to a counting notion where we are interested in &quot;how many&quot; rather than &quot;in what order.&quot; In practice, this broad meaning of enumeration is often used to compare the relative sizes or cardinalities of different sets. If one works in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice, one may want to impose the additional restriction that an enumeration must also be injective (without repetition) since in this theory, the existence of a surjection from &quot;I&quot; onto &quot;S&quot; need not imply the existence of an injection from &quot;S&quot; into &quot;I&quot;.

== Computability and complexity theory ==

In computability theory one often considers countable enumerations with the added requirement that the mapping from formula_1 (set of all natural numbers) to the enumerated set must be computable. The set being enumerated is then called recursively enumerable (or computably enumerable in more contemporary language), referring to the use of recursion theory in formalizations of what it means for the map to be computable.

In this sense, a subset of the natural numbers is computably enumerable if it is the range of a computable function. In this context, enumerable may be used to mean computably enumerable. However, these definitions characterize distinct classes since there are uncountably many subsets of the natural numbers that can be enumerated by an arbitrary function with domain ω and only countably many computable functions. A specific example of a set with an enumeration but not a computable enumeration is the complement of the halting set.

Furthermore, this characterization illustrates a place where the ordering of the listing is important. There exists a computable enumeration of the halting set, but not one that lists the elements in an increasing ordering. If there were one, then the halting set would be decidable, which is provably false. In general, being recursively enumerable is a weaker condition than being a decidable set.

The notion of enumeration has also been studied from the point of view of computational complexity theory for various tasks in the context of enumeration algorithms.

<doc id="212120" wikidata="Q813639" url="?curid=212120" title="Bechtel">
<text>Bechtel Corporation () is an American engineering, procurement, construction, and project management company founded in San Francisco, California in 1898, and headquartered in Reston, Virginia. , the &quot;Engineering News-Record&quot; ranked Bechtel as the second largest construction company in the United States, following Turner Construction.

== History ==

=== Founding and early years ===
Bechtel&#x27;s business activities began in 1898, when cattle farmer Warren A. Bechtel moved from Peabody, Kansas, to the Oklahoma Territory to construct railroads with his team of mules. Bechtel moved his family frequently between construction sites around the western United States for the next several years, eventually moving to Oakland, California, in 1904, where he worked as the superintendent on the Western Pacific Railroad. In 1906, W. A. Bechtel won his first subcontract to build part of the Oroville-to-Oakland section of the Western Pacific Railroad. That year he bought a steam shovel, becoming a pioneer of the new technology. He painted &quot;W.A. Bechtel Co.&quot; on the side of the steam shovel, effectively establishing Bechtel as a company, although it was not yet incorporated. Bechtel completed work on a series of railroad contracts during the early 1900s, culminating in an extension of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad finished in 1914.

Starting with the construction of Klamath River Highway in California in 1919, Bechtel ventured into jobs other than building railroads. The company built roads, bridges, and highways throughout the western United States. The company worked on its first hydroelectric projects in the 1920s for Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California.

In 1925, Warren, his sons Warren A. Bechtel Jr, Stephen, Kenneth (Ken), and his brother Arthur (Art) joined him to incorporate as &quot;W.A. Bechtel Company&quot;, which by this time was the leading construction company in the western United States. In 1929, Warren&#x27;s son, Stephen, urged his father to embark on the company&#x27;s first pipeline project. Bechtel began working with California Standard Oil Company to build pipelines and refineries.

In January 1931, Bechtel joined other contractors in the west to form Six Companies, Inc., a consortium created to bid for a contract from the U.S. government to construct the Hoover Dam. Six Companies won the bid in March and construction began in the summer of 1931.

=== WWII, overseas expansion and the nuclear age ===
Warren Bechtel died unexpectedly in 1933 while in Moscow on business. He was succeeded by his oldest son, Warren A. Bechtel Jr., first, then later Stephen Bechtel Sr., who became both the head of Bechtel and chief executive of the Hoover Dam project. Under his leadership, the Hoover Dam was finished in 1935. The project was the largest of its kind in U.S. history at the time and Bechtel&#x27;s first megaproject.

During World War II, the United States Maritime Commission invited the company to bid for a contract to build half of their order of 60 cargo ships. The company had no prior experience in shipbuilding, but bid for the entire 60 ships. Between 1941 and 1945, Bechtel&#x27;s wartime shipyards, including Marinship and Calship, built 560 vessels. Bechtel also worked on a pipeline from the Yukon to Alaska called Canol for the United States Department of War during this period.

Under Stephen Bechtel Sr., the company diversified its projects and expanded its work into other countries. The company also focused on turnkey projects, a concept Stephen Bechtel Sr. pioneered, in which Bechtel handled a project from planning and design through construction.

Bechtel&#x27;s first job outside the U.S. was building the Mene Grande pipeline in Venezuela in 1940. In 1947, Bechtel began construction on what was then the world&#x27;s longest oil pipeline, the Trans-Arabian Pipeline, which began in Saudi Arabia, ran across Jordan and Syria, and ended in Lebanon, followed by the Kirkuk–Baniyas pipeline from Kirkuk, also to the Mediterranean. The company continued to expand globally throughout the 1940s, particularly in the Middle East.

In 1949, Bechtel began working with nuclear power after being contracted to build the Experimental Breeder Reactor I in Idaho. The company later built the United States&#x27; first privately financed commercial nuclear power plant, the Dresden Generating Station, for Commonwealth Edison in Illinois in 1957.

Other major projects in the 1950s included the Trans Mountain Pipeline in 1952, an oil pipeline in Canada, and a preliminary study for the English Channel in 1959. Bechtel also began engineering work on the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in 1959.

=== Megaprojects era ===
Stephen D. Bechtel Jr. took over for his father as president of the company as Stephen Bechtel Sr. retired in 1960. During the 1960s and 1970s, Bechtel was involved in constructing 40% of the nuclear plants in the United States. In 1968, the company completed the largest nuclear plant in the U.S. at the time, the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, in California.
In 1972, Bechtel was involved in approximately 20% of all of the United States&#x27; new power-generating capacity. By the end of the decade, the company had moved from nuclear power construction toward nuclear cleanup projects, including Three Mile Island in 1979.

Bechtel completed work on other megaprojects during the 1970s, including major airports in Saudi Arabia and the metro rail in Washington, D.C. In 1976, the company began work on the industrial city of Jubail in Saudi Arabia. The company&#x27;s multiple construction contracts helped to transform the area from a small village to a city with a population of over a quarter of a million people.

In the 1980s, Bechtel handled the project management of the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics. The company also built the Ankara-Gerede Motorway in Turkey as part of the network of roadways linking Europe and Asia in 1986.

In 1987, Bechtel was awarded a contract for project management services of an undersea tunnel linking the UK and France called the Channel Tunnel or &quot;Chunnel&quot;. The tunnel was completed in 1994.

=== Increased business and visibility ===
The recession of the 1980s turned the company&#x27;s focus toward new areas of growth including environmental cleanup and alternative energy projects. In 1989 Riley P. Bechtel was named president of the company.

In 1991, Bechtel, in a joint venture with Parsons Brinckerhoff, broke ground on Boston&#x27;s Central Artery/Tunnel Project or &quot;Big Dig&quot;, a project the company had been in charge of since 1986. The Big Dig was, at the time, the largest and most complex urban transportation project ever undertaken in the US. The 20-year project was critiqued for rising costs and increasing scope of work, as the Big Dig became more complex than was originally estimated. Criticism of the project increased in 2005 when a leak sprang in one of the new tunnels. In the summer of 2006, a faulty tunnel ceiling panel collapsed, killing a motorist. Litigation ensued, and in January 2008, Bechtel settled with federal and state officials for $352 million with other contractors involved paying smaller amounts.

As a result of the Gulf War, Bechtel accepted the task of extinguishing oil well fires in Kuwait in 1991. This fire-suppression project was part of the effort to rebuild the infrastructure of Kuwait.

In 1994, Bechtel began work on the US$20 billion Hong Kong Airport Core Programme, which was the largest civil engineering project at the time and included a new airport and nine other infrastructure projects. Bechtel&#x27;s other major projects during the 1990s included the Athens Metro system, the Atlantic LNG in Trinidad, the Croatian Motorway, the Jubilee Line Extension for the London Underground, Quezon Power Plant in the Philippines, and a semiconductor plant in China. Bechtel also managed design and construction of facilities for Olympic games: the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics, and the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan in 1998. In the early 2000s, the company provided planning and management services for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In 2001, Bechtel was part of a consortium to project manage the US$4.3 billion construction of the CSPC Nanhai Petrochemicals Complex in China.

Several projects in the 2000s attracted controversy. In 2000, after a protest against water prices being raised by a utility partially owned by Bechtel in Bolivia, the company pulled out of the country and later filed suit against Bolivia for $25 million in losses. The claim was settled in 2006 for $0.30.

In 2001, Bechtel began work on the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at the Hanford site in Washington state. The project is a highly complex plant for the treatment of radioactive liquid waste that has employed new technologies and construction techniques that are the first of their kind. As of 2013, it is considered the most complex project in the US. Management of the project has been the subject of controversy including the Department of Energy&#x27;s Inspector General reports and Government Accountability Office studies regarding rising costs, nuclear safety and quality, and whistleblower allegations. For example, in 2013 the DOE Inspector General concluded that &quot;Bechtel determined that there was a systemic problem and a breakdown in controls over the review of design changes&quot;, but that the company had taken steps to correct the problems.

In 2003, Bechtel won a $680 million contract to begin rebuilding infrastructure in Iraq for U.S. Agency for International Development. The contract led to the company being accused of both non-competitive bidding and war profiteering. Bechtel won a competitively-bid second contract in January 2004, and completed 97 of 99 task orders of the contract, returning the two remaining projects due to the escalating security concerns in the country.

Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Bechtel was one of four companies hired by FEMA to build temporary housing. Bechtel delivered over 35,000 trailers in under a year for displaced residents in Mississippi, though the company was criticized by officials and in the media for the cost and quality of work.

In 2007, Bechtel began work on the Romanian A3 motorway (Autostrada Transilvania) and Albanian motorways. Bechtel and the Romanian National Roads Authority jointly agreed on a settlement to end the contract for works on the Autostrada Transilvania in 2013. The Albanian Motorway was opened to traffic in 2010 on schedule.

Other major projects at the end of the 2000s included the twinning of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington state, Jamnagar Refinery expansion in India, Equatorial GuineaLNG, and Oak Creek Power Plant in Wisconsin.

=== 2000 Bolivian water privatization, rate increase and violence ===

After years of unreliable water supply and 40% water loss in the city of Cochabamba, Bolivia, the World Bank pressured Bolivia to put SEMAPA (the Cochabamba water utility) up for auction without funding. Bechtel and others formed a consortium named &quot;Aguas del Tunari&quot; (Water of Tunari – a local regional term) to file a bid to the city of Cochabamba, Bolivia in 1999. Bechtel was a 27% partner and Abengoa S.A. of Spain was a 25% partner. This bid was in response to the increasing pressure from the World Bank, which had funded and extended water supply projects for the country of Bolivia, to privatize the water utility of Cochabamba. With the strings attached in 1995, and the World Bank participating in draft bids in 1997, the Aguas del Tunari consortium were the only bidders for the auction. The bid was accepted, under pressure of the World Bank and the conditions of their loans to Bolivia. The terms were ratified in the often-cited Law 2029 by the legislative body of Bolivia, however largely it had previously been accepted and influenced by local governments. Under the terms, Bechtel and the consortium immediately raised water pricing 35% and after the first month they had raised the price for water to the residents by almost 60% and in other parts much higher. The Bechtel consortium contract claimed harvesting of rainwater violated its contract essentially monopolizing the supply of water to millions of people. Water became one fifth of the average person&#x27;s expenses and protests erupted. Protests were met with a cold shoulder response by Bechtel expressing they would simply cut-off water to those who did not pay. Further protests were enhanced when agricultural sectors realized the bylaws allowed Bechtel and the consortium rights to rain water as well, which was assumed to mean they could no longer collect rain water.

Violence between protesters and police resulted in the burning of government buildings and hundreds of injured within the first days of the conflict. The local governments of Manfred Reyes Villa (mayor) and Jose Pepe Orias (prefect or governor) resigned. The contract was ultimately abandoned, for which Bechtel in February 2021 demanded settlement. The aftermath of the violence was destruction of public property in downtown Cochabamba paid for by taxpayers, the death of one civilian, restitution by the government, and hundreds of injured police, military personnel, and protestors. A movie titled &quot;Even the Rain&quot; with actor Gael García Bernal depicts a historical fiction story set in this time. The conflict became known as the Cochabamba Water War.

== Locations and operational activities ==
Bechtel&#x27;s major operational locations are in Brisbane, Calgary, Chandler, Arizona, Dubai, Houston, Knoxville, Tennessee, London, New Delhi, Reston, Virginia, San Francisco, Santiago, Shanghai, Nairobi, Taipei, and Washington, D.C.

The company is headquartered in Reston, which also houses the company&#x27;s global operational headquarters, as well as the headquarters of the Nuclear, Security &amp; Environmental global business unit and the Americas offices of the Infrastructure global business unit. The company&#x27;s Oil, Gas &amp; Chemicals unit is based in the Houston office. The Washington office is home to the government affairs team, and maintains a Political Action Committee.

Outside of North America, the Infrastructure unit&#x27;s headquarters is located at the company&#x27;s London office. The Mining &amp; Metals unit is based out of Santiago, Chile, and Brisbane. In 2013, the company established its global center of engineering excellence in Dubai focusing on rail and marine projects. It established innovation centers in Houston and London in 2015 and Santiago in 2018 to test new technology.

Bechtel works on global megaprojects through its four business units. The company frequently manages work from design through construction phases. Its corporate values include safety, quality, and ethics.

Bechtel was the presenting sponsor of &quot;Dream Big: Engineering Our World&quot;, a 42-minute IMAX documentary produced by MacGillivray Freeman Films in partnership with American Society of Civil Engineers. The documentary seeks to inspire young people to pursue engineering careers.

Bechtel opened its welding and applied technology center in 2017 in the Houston Energy Corridor to train welding and construction workers. The center also provides virtual training and augmented reality to train workers.

Its Houston offices were in the Houston Galleria area; in 2022 the company announced it would move those offices to Westchase, Houston effective late 2023.

=== Infrastructure ===
The Infrastructure unit handles transportation, power, and hydroelectric facilities. Transportation projects include highways, bridges, rail, and aviation facilities. Bechtel has built more than of roadway, 390 power plants, 50 hydroelectric plants, as well as 20 towns and cities globally. It has worked on 300 subway and rail projects, 80 port and harbor projects, and 96 major airport projects.

Bechtel&#x27;s Infrastructure unit is leading a consortium in the engineering, procurement and construction of lines One and Two of the Riyadh, Saudi Arabia metro, which began construction in April 2014. In July 2014, Bechtel was selected to build a new 37-mile motorway linking Kosovo&#x27;s capital, Pristina, to Macedonia.

Bechtel is also participating in the building of London&#x27;s Crossrail, a $24 billion project that will connect commuter towns east and west of London and is intended to serve an estimated 200 million people a year upon completion. As of June 2015, the project is 65% complete.

In 2016, Bechtel began construction on the first phase of the Edmonton Valley Line Light Rail Transit project in Alberta, Canada, the first public–private partnership (P3) business group. The company is also involved in several ongoing projects as of 2016, including building national infrastructure in Gabon and supporting the continuous development of Jubail industrial city in Saudi Arabia. Bechtel has worked at Jubail for more than 40 years, and was granted a five-year extension on both projects June 2016.

In February 2017, Bechtel was chosen to support setting up and operating Saudi Arabia&#x27;s National Project Management Office. In May 2017, Bechtel was appointed the delivery management partner for the tunnels and stations excavation package of Stage 2 of the Sydney Metro project. Considered Australia&#x27;s largest public infrastructure project, the work includes new twin rail tunnels under Sydney Harbour. Bechtel won the contract in August 2017 to design and build a 473-kilometer highway with 19 interchanges linking Nairobi, Kenya&#x27;s capital, to Mombasa, Kenya&#x27;s main port. The first section is targeted to open in October 2019 and the entire length of the highway is scheduled to be complete in 2024.

In 2018, Bechtel&#x27;s work on the Panda Power Funds&#x27; 1.1 GW natural gas Hummel Station Power Plant in Pennsylvania was completed.

<doc id="212121" wikidata="Q287309" url="?curid=212121" title="Kate Pierson">
<text>Catherine Elizabeth Pierson (born April 27, 1948) is an American singer, lyricist, and founding member of the B-52s. She plays guitar, bass and various keyboard instruments. In the early years, as well as being a vocalist, Pierson was the main keyboard player and performed on a keyboard bass during live shows and on many of the band&#x27;s recordings, taking on a role usually filled by a bass guitar player, which differentiated the band from their contemporaries. This, along with Pierson&#x27;s distinctive wide-ranging singing voice, remains a trademark of the B-52s&#x27; unique sound. Pierson has also collaborated with many other artists including the Ramones, Iggy Pop and R.E.M. Pierson possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range.

In February 2015, Pierson released her first solo album, &quot;Guitars and Microphones&quot;, featuring material co-written by Sia. She later released the non-album single &quot;Better Not Sting the Bee&quot;, and then she released an April 16, 2016 cover of &quot;Venus&quot; as a single. Side B included &quot;Radio In Bed&quot; written by Kate and her wife Monica Coleman. Both tracks were produced by Jack White.

==Early life and education==
Pierson was born in Weehawken, New Jersey, and raised in Rutherford.

Pierson briefly attended Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois before transferring to Boston University, where she earned a journalism degree. She then traveled around Europe for a time in the 1970s, including six months working as a barmaid in The Anson pub in Wallsend, UK, before returning to the U.S. and moving to Athens, Georgia, where she lived on a farm and earned a living as a paste-up artist in the type shop of the local newspaper.

==Music career==
Pierson met up with the other members of what would become the B-52s while living in Athens, Georgia. The band formed in October 1976 and played a few parties before heading to New York to play some shows. Eventually, Pierson and the other band members began commuting between Athens and New York, playing gigs.

==Personal life==
Pierson was married to Brian Cokayne, a Mancunian, whom she met while living in Europe between 1971 and 1973.

From 1981 to 1996, Pierson was in a relationship with artist Tim Rollins.

In 2003, Pierson started a relationship with artist and designer Monica Coleman. They got married on August 3, 2015.

Pierson and Coleman developed Kate&#x27;s Lazy Meadow motel complex in Mount Tremper, New York in 2003. They have also owned Kate&#x27;s Lazy Cabin in nearby Lake Hill, New York, both in the Catskill Mountains, Kate&#x27;s Lazy Desert in Landers, California, and Kate&#x27;s Lazy Cape located on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. They have operated the businesses together. In 2022, Pierson indicated that the couple had sold Kate&#x27;s Lazy Meadow, then purchased the vacation home on Cape Cod in Truro, Massachusetts. 

In a 2015 interview, Pierson stated that she identifies as bisexual.

==Collaborations==

<doc id="212122" wikidata="Q1856396" url="?curid=212122" title="The Pharcyde">
<text>The Pharcyde is an American hip hop group, formed in 1989, from South Central Los Angeles. The original four members of the group are Imani (Emandu Wilcox), Slimkid3 (Trevant Hardson), Bootie Brown (Romye Robinson), and Fatlip (Derrick Stewart). DJ Mark Luv was the group&#x27;s first disc jockey (DJ), followed by producer J-Swift.

The group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; (1992), featuring the hit single &quot;Passin&#x27; Me By&quot;, was highly acclaimed and has gone on to be cited as one of the greatest albums in alternative hip-hop. In 1995 the group released second studio album &quot;Labcabincalifornia&quot; to further commercial success, featuring crossover hit singles &quot;Drop&quot; and &quot;Runnin&quot;. &quot;Labcabincalifornia&quot; received mixed critical reception upon its initial release, but has since achieved retrospective critical acclaim.

The group began to unravel in the late 1990s with the departures of Fatlip and Slimkid3. The remaining members of the group released the follow up albums &quot;Plain Rap&quot; (2000) and &quot;Humboldt Beginnings&quot; (2004), but the group never regained its former commercial or critical success. In 2008 all four members of the group temporarily reunited for performances at that year&#x27;s Rock the Bells festival. Since the 2008 reunion, legal disputes over The Pharcyde name has led to various combinations of the four members touring under various names including &quot;The Pharcyde&quot; and &quot;Far Side (Formerly of the Pharcyde)&quot;; however, the four members last reunited in 2022 on Fatlip’s sophomore album, “Torpor”, for the single titled “My Bad”, which sees them apologizing to one another over their past transgressions.

==History==
===Early years===
Pharcyde group members Slimkid3, Bootie Brown, and Imani met as dancers in the late 1980s. Dancing was their main ambition as late as 1990. Around this time, Imani and Slimkid3 were in a group called &quot;As Is&quot; and later a group called the &quot;Play Brothers&quot;, while Bootie Brown was a backup dancer for Fatlip (Fatlip being the last member to join the group). Bootie Brown recalls that their earlier dancing careers influenced their rapping – &quot;sometimes the way I rap is almost like the way I used to dance&quot;. The group met Reggie Andrews, a local high-school music teacher who worked with the Dazz Band and Rick James, and who was a major musical influence on their debut album. The group also met producer J-Swift around this time at SCU (South Central Unit), as he was Reggie Andrews&#x27;s &quot;star pupil&quot; according to the book &quot;Check the Technique&quot;. Before group settled on the name &quot;The Pharcyde&quot;, they were almost called &quot;The Rappers&quot; and &quot;True Jiggaboo&quot;, with the latter serving as inspiration for their interlude &quot;Jiggaboo Time&quot;.

===&quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot;===
The Pharcyde recorded their first demo in 1991, which contained the songs &quot;Passin&#x27; Me By&quot;, &quot;Ya Mama&quot;, and &quot;Officer&quot;, and hired a manager, Paul Stewart, who had worked for Cypress Hill, De La Soul, and House of Pain. Mike Ross of Delicious Vinyl heard the demo and the group was signed to the label in the summer of 1991. They were first featured on Brand New Heavies&#x27;s album &quot;Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 1&quot;, on the song &quot;Soul Flower&quot;, released by Delicious Vinyl in 1992.

The group, along with producer J-Swift, recorded their first album &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot;, which was released in November 1992. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1996. The album was highly acclaimed, and became one of the most praised and influential alternative hip hop albums of the 1990s.

Their second single &quot;Passin&#x27; Me By&quot; became a minor &quot;Billboard&quot; hit, peaking at No. 52 on the Hot 100. The song was later featured in the hit movie &quot;Big Daddy&quot; and was also a crossover modern rock hit. The song is now usually considered a golden-era staple and is the group&#x27;s most well-known song. The album featured a couple of guest MCs, including Bucwheed (known then as Buckwheat, formerly of the alternative hip-hop group The Wascals) on the tracks &quot;On The DL&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m That Type of Nigga&quot;.

About the group&#x27;s sense of humor, Imani was quoted in a 1993 interview saying, &quot;We find humor in things other people don’t. Everyday situations. People might look at things around here and say, like, ‘Damn!’ We say, ‘Hah, hah, hah.’ We just chill out.&quot;

Problems between the group and producer J-Swift began during the recording of the debut, with infighting and &quot;personality conflicts&quot;.

After the &quot;Bizarre Ride&quot; album was released, the group began touring with A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul, culminating with an appearance at the Lollapalooza show in 1994.

In 1994, Pharcyde appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;.

Before the success of &quot;Bizarre Ride,&quot; the group moved to Inglewood, California, where they shared a home dubbed the Pharcyde Manor. Lew of &quot;Dirt&quot; magazine reports of the Manor, &quot;...you can tell their laid-back style meeting rapid-fire rhyme delivery is a product of the virtual telepathic rapport that only comes from eating, sleeping and breathing under the same roof.&quot;

===&quot;Labcabincalifornia&quot;===
In 1995, The Pharcyde released their second album, &quot;Labcabincalifornia&quot;. The album received mixed reviews upon release, maybe due to a different musical direction from the light-hearted playfulness of their debut. The album included another big crossover hit, &quot;Runnin&quot;, peaking at No. 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This single was later featured in the movie &quot;8 Mile&quot;, as well as the &quot;More Music from 8 Mile&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Labcabincalifornia&quot; featured production from Jay Dee, who handled the majority of the production. Member Slimkid3 has stated that the group met Jay Dee by way of Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest, who handed them the tape that contained some of the production that would end up on the LP. This album generated lower sales, not reaching gold status. A music video for the song &quot;Drop&quot; was directed by Spike Jonze.

Problems grew between Fatlip and the other MCs after this album, resulting in his leaving the group. In the documentary &quot;Cydeways: The Best of the Pharcyde&quot;, while the group is performing in shows they still offer their support to Fatlip, telling the crowd that if they support Fatlip on his solo career then they support The Pharcyde and vice versa.

===1997–2000===
The group was largely missing from the hip hop scene between 1997 and 1999. The three remaining members returned in 2000 with an EP titled &quot;Chapter One: Testing the Waters&quot;.

The group released a full studio album later in 2000 titled &quot;Plain Rap&quot;. The album had a lukewarm reception both critically and commercially.

Soon after the release, member Slimkid3, now going by his birth name of Tre Hardson, left the group to pursue a solo career. In 2002, he released his first solo album titled &quot;Liberation&quot;.

===2001–2004: &quot;Humboldt Beginnings&quot;===
With only two members remaining, Bootie Brown and Imani continued with the group name and released &quot;Humboldt Beginnings&quot; in 2004. The album received even less attention critically and commercially than their last effort. This album introduced Schmooche Cat and Spaceboy Boogie X as new members and Spaceboy Boogie X as producer to the group.

The album was released on the group&#x27;s own independent record label, Chapter One Entertainment.

===Touring===

Though &quot;Humboldt Beginnings&quot; is to date the last Pharcyde album, its members have since been keeping busy with various contributions and projects. A compilation of The Pharcyde was released in 2005, titled &quot;Sold My Soul: The Remix &amp; Rarity Collection&quot;, featuring a number of remixes and rare songs. Former member Fatlip released his solo debut in 2005, titled &quot;The Loneliest Punk&quot;, and Tre Hardson&#x27;s second full-length solo album &quot;SLIMKID3&#x27;s Cafe&quot; was released on April 4, 2006.

In late 2007, Tre toured with L.A. Latin-funk-hip hop band Ozomatli on their Winter Tour throughout the United States.

The Pharcyde and Souls of Mischief collaborated to form a group called &quot;Almyghty Myghty Pythons&quot; and released a collaboration album entitled &quot;Almyghty Myghty Pythons&quot;. Production from the group died down, but it was said by Imani in an interview that it was to be an ongoing project.

Fatlip and Tre Hardson reunited to perform on &#x27;The Over 30, Dirty Old Men Tour&#x27;. Fatlip and Tre Hardson were featured on the song &quot;All I Want for Christmas (Is Somebody Else)&quot; featuring St. Imey (formerly of The Wascals) and produced by J-Swift on Delicious Vinyl records.

In 2005, Bootie Brown made a guest appearance on Gorillaz&#x27; single &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, from the album &quot;Demon Days&quot;. He has toured off and on with Gorillaz ever since, sometimes also filling in live for Mos Def on the Gorillaz&#x27; song &quot;Stylo&quot;. In 2022, he appeared on a second song with the band, titled &quot;New Gold&quot; alongside Tame Impala.

On April 22, 2008 it was announced that The Pharcyde would be reuniting for the annual Rock the Bells Festival Series. The first performance was Saturday, July 19 in Chicago.

Remixes of The Pharcyde&#x27;s &quot;Runnin and &quot;Passin&#x27; Me By&quot; appear on Delicious Vinyl&#x27;s 2008 release, &quot;Rmxxology&quot;.

The Pharcyde toured Australia in February 2009 as part of the Good Vibrations Festival, which was headlined by Fatboy Slim, and played in Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast and Perth. They also headlined at the All Points West Festival in Liberty State Park, NJ on July 31, 2009.

The Pharcyde also reunited at Rhymesayers Entertainment&#x27;s soundset, Memorial Day Weekend, 2009, and were the co-headliners of the festival, which was also headlined by Atmosphere and featured many other underground artists.

Uncle Imani went on FIVE10 Radio to talk about the story behind the growth and demise of The Pharcyde.

The downfall of The Pharcyde was named the 26th (out of 30) worst fall-offs in hip hop history by &quot;Complex&quot; magazine in December 2012.

2012 saw the twentieth anniversary of The Pharcyde&#x27;s debut &quot;Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde&quot;, and to mark the event Fatlip and SlimKid3 teamed up with the album&#x27;s producers, J-Sw!ft and L.A. Jay, as well as record label Delicious Vinyl, to play the album in its entirety at a tribute show at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. The performance was intended to be a one-off, but due to an overwhelming success and reception, the group began touring the show &#x27;Bizarre Ride Live&#x27;, and, along with MC K-Natural, working on original music under the moniker The Bizarre Ride. In December of that year, The Pharcyde released the Amerigo Gazaway-produced &quot;Still Got Love (Bizarre Tribe Megamix)&quot; garnering significant praise. 2015 marked the twentieth anniversary of &quot;Labcabincalifornia&quot;, resulting in a similar tour through Europe and Japan. The group continued touring Europe through 2017.

In 2022 IMANI, Slimkid3 and Fatlip launched a &quot;30th Anniversary of Bizarre Ride&quot; tour performing as &quot;The Far Side&quot; &quot;(Formerly of The Pharcyde)&quot;.

==Current==
In 2020, DUBCNN reported that there would be a reunion of all four members of Pharcyde on Fatlip&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;Torpor&quot;, with two Pharcyde tracks confirmed. The single, titled “My Bad”, was released on August 1, 2022. “Torpor” was officially released via bandcamp on July 29, 2022 on CD and February 3rd, 2023 on vinyl. Although they have recorded new music, an entire album has yet to be confirmed.

<text>In electromagnetism, the Mie solution to Maxwell&#x27;s equations (also known as the Lorenz–Mie solution, the Lorenz–Mie–Debye solution or Mie scattering) describes the scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave by a homogeneous sphere. The solution takes the form of an infinite series of spherical multipole partial waves. It is named after German physicist Gustav Mie.

The term &quot;Mie solution&quot; is also used for solutions of Maxwell&#x27;s equations for scattering by stratified spheres or by infinite cylinders, or other geometries where one can write separate equations for the radial and angular dependence of solutions. The term &quot;Mie theory&quot; is sometimes used for this collection of solutions and methods; it does not refer to an independent physical theory or law. More broadly, the &quot;Mie scattering&quot; formulas are most useful in situations where the size of the scattering particles is comparable to the wavelength of the light, rather than much smaller or much larger.

Mie scattering (sometimes referred to as a non-molecular scattering or aerosol particle scattering) takes place in the lower of the atmosphere, where many essentially spherical particles with diameters approximately equal to the wavelength of the incident ray may be present. Mie scattering theory has no upper size limitation, and converges to the limit of geometric optics for large particles.

==Introduction==
A modern formulation of the Mie solution to the scattering problem on a sphere can be found in many books, e.g., J. A. Stratton&#x27;s &quot;Electromagnetic Theory&quot;. In this formulation, the incident plane wave, as well as the scattering field, is expanded into radiating spherical vector spherical harmonics. The internal field is expanded into regular vector spherical harmonics. By enforcing the boundary condition on the spherical surface, the expansion coefficients of the scattered field can be computed.

For particles much larger or much smaller than the wavelength of the scattered light there are simple and accurate approximations that suffice to describe the behavior of the system. But for objects whose size is within a few orders of magnitude of the wavelength, e.g., water droplets in the atmosphere, latex particles in paint, droplets in emulsions, including milk, and biological cells and cellular components, a more detailed approach is necessary.

The Mie solution is named after its developer, German physicist Gustav Mie. Danish physicist Ludvig Lorenz and others independently developed the theory of electromagnetic plane wave scattering by a dielectric sphere.

The formalism allows the calculation of the electric and magnetic fields inside and outside a spherical object and is generally used to calculate either how much light is scattered (the total optical cross section), or where it goes (the form factor). The notable features of these results are the Mie resonances, sizes that scatter particularly strongly or weakly. This is in contrast to Rayleigh scattering for small particles and Rayleigh–Gans–Debye scattering (after Lord Rayleigh, Richard Gans and Peter Debye) for large particles. The existence of resonances and other features of Mie scattering makes it a particularly useful formalism when using scattered light to measure particle size.

==Approximations==

===Rayleigh approximation (scattering)===

Rayleigh scattering describes the elastic scattering of light by spheres that are much smaller than the wavelength of light. The intensity &quot;I&quot; of the scattered radiation is given by
:formula_1
where &quot;I0&quot; is the light intensity before the interaction with the particle, &quot;R&quot; is the distance between the particle and the observer, &quot;θ&quot; is the scattering angle, &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of light under consideration, &quot;n&quot; is the refractive index of the particle, and &quot;d&quot; is the diameter of the particle.

It can be seen from the above equation that Rayleigh scattering is strongly dependent upon the size of the particle and the wavelengths. The intensity of the Rayleigh scattered radiation increases rapidly as the ratio of particle size to wavelength increases. Furthermore, the intensity of Rayleigh scattered radiation is identical in the forward and reverse directions.

The Rayleigh scattering model breaks down when the particle size becomes larger than around 10% of the wavelength of the incident radiation. In the case of particles with dimensions greater than this, Mie&#x27;s scattering model can be used to find the intensity of the scattered radiation. The intensity of Mie scattered radiation is given by the summation of an infinite series of terms rather than by a simple mathematical expression. It can be shown, however, that scattering in this range of particle sizes differs from Rayleigh scattering in several respects: it is roughly independent of wavelength and it is larger in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.

The blue colour of the sky results from Rayleigh scattering, as the size of the gas particles in the atmosphere is much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Rayleigh scattering is much greater for blue light than for other colours due to its shorter wavelength. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, its blue component is Rayleigh scattered strongly by atmospheric gases but the longer wavelength (e.g. red/yellow) components are not. The sunlight arriving directly from the Sun therefore appears to be slightly yellow, while the light scattered through rest of the sky appears blue. During sunrises and sunsets, the effect of Rayleigh scattering on the spectrum of the transmitted light is much greater due to the greater distance the light rays have to travel through the high-density air near the Earth&#x27;s surface.

In contrast, the water droplets that make up clouds are of a comparable size to the wavelengths in visible light, and the scattering is described by Mie&#x27;s model rather than that of Rayleigh. Here, all wavelengths of visible light are scattered approximately identically, and the clouds therefore appear to be white or grey.

===Rayleigh–Gans approximation===
The Rayleigh–Gans approximation is an approximate solution to light scattering when the relative refractive index of the particle is close to that of the environment, and its size is much smaller in comparison to the wavelength of light divided by |&quot;n&quot; − 1|, where &quot;n&quot; is the refractive index:

:formula_2 

where formula_3 is the wavevector of the light (formula_4), and formula_5 refers to the linear dimension of the particle. The former condition is often referred as &quot;optically soft&quot; and the approximation holds for particles of arbitrary shape.

===Anomalous diffraction approximation of van de Hulst===
The anomalous diffraction approximation is valid for large (compared to wavelength) and optically soft spheres; soft in the context of optics implies that the refractive index of the particle (m) differs only slightly from the refractive index of the environment, and the particle subjects the wave to only a small phase shift. The extinction efficiency in this approximation is given by
:formula_6
where &quot;Q&quot; is the efficiency factor of scattering, which is defined as the ratio of the scattering cross-section and geometrical cross-section π&quot;a&quot;2.

The term &quot;p&quot; = 4πa(&quot;n&quot; − 1)/λ has as its physical meaning the phase delay of the wave passing through the centre of the sphere, where &quot;a&quot; is the sphere radius, &quot;n&quot; is the ratio of refractive indices inside and outside of the sphere, and &quot;λ&quot; the wavelength of the light.

This set of equations was first described by van de Hulst in (1957).

==Mathematics==

The scattering by a spherical nanoparticle is solved exactly regardless of the particle size. We consider scattering by a plane wave propagating along the &quot;z&quot;-axis polarized along the &quot;x&quot;-axis. Dielectric and magnetic permeabilities of a particle are formula_7 and formula_8, and formula_9 and formula_10 for the environment.

In order to solve the scattering problem, we write first the solutions of the vector Helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates, since the fields inside and outside the particles must satisfy it. Helmholtz equation:
: formula_11

In addition to the Helmholtz equation, the fields must satisfy the conditions formula_12 and formula_13, formula_14.
Vector spherical harmonics possess all the necessary properties, introduced as follows:
: formula_15 — magnetic harmonics (TE),
: formula_16 — electric harmonics (TM),

where
: formula_17
: formula_18
and formula_19 — Associated Legendre polynomials, and formula_20 — any of the spherical Bessel functions.

Next, we expand the incident plane wave in vector spherical harmonics:
: formula_21

Here the superscript formula_22 means that in the radial part of the functions formula_23 are spherical Bessel functions of the first kind.
The expansion coefficients are obtained by taking integrals of the form

: formula_24
In this case, all coefficients at formula_25 are zero, since the integral over the angle formula_26 in the numerator is zero.

Then the following conditions are imposed:
# Interface conditions on the boundary between the sphere and the environment (which allow us to relate the expansion coefficients of the incident, internal, and scattered fields)
# The condition that the solution is bounded at the origin (therefore, in the radial part of the generating functions formula_23, spherical Bessel functions of the first kind are selected for the internal field),
# For a scattered field, the asymptotics at infinity corresponds to a diverging spherical wave (in connection with this, for the scattered field in the radial part of the generating functions formula_23 spherical Hankel functions of the first kind are chosen).

Scattered fields are written in terms of a vector harmonic expansion as
: formula_29
: formula_30

Here the superscript formula_31 means that in the radial part of the functions formula_23 are spherical Hankel functions of the first kind (those of the second kind would have formula_33), and formula_34,

Internal fields:
: formula_35
: formula_36
formula_37 is the wave vector outside the particle formula_38 is the wave vector in the medium from the particle material, formula_39 and formula_40 are the refractive indices of the medium and the particle.

After applying the interface conditions, we obtain expressions for the coefficients:
: formula_41
: formula_42
: formula_43
: formula_44

where
:formula_45
:formula_46 with formula_47 being the radius of the sphere.

formula_48 and formula_49 represent the spherical functions of Bessel and Hankel of the first kind, respectively.

=== Scattering and extinction cross-sections ===
Values commonly calculated using Mie theory include efficiency coefficients for extinction formula_50, scattering formula_51, and absorption formula_52. These efficiency coefficients are ratios of the cross section of the respective process, formula_53, to the particle protected area, formula_54, where &quot;a&quot; is the particle radius. 
According to the definition of extinction,
:formula_55 and formula_56.
The scattering and extinction coefficients can be represented as the infinite series:
:formula_57
:formula_58

The contributions in these sums, indexed by &quot;n&quot;, correspond to the orders of a multipole expansion with being the dipole term, being the quadrupole term, and so forth.

=== Application to larger particles ===
If the size of the particle is equal to several wavelengths in the material, then the scattered fields have some features. Further, the form of the electric field is key, since the magnetic field is obtained from it by taking the curl.

All Mie coefficients depend on the frequency and have maximums when the denominator is close to zero (exact equality to zero is achieved for complex frequencies). In this case, it is possible, that the contribution of one specific harmonic dominates in scattering. Then at large distances from the particle, the radiation pattern of the scattered field will be similar to the corresponding radiation pattern of the angular part of vector spherical harmonics. The harmonics formula_59 correspond to electric dipoles (if the contribution of this harmonic dominates in the expansion of the electric field, then the field is similar to the electric dipole field), formula_60 correspond to the electric field of the magnetic dipole, formula_61 and formula_62 - electric and magnetic quadrupoles, formula_63 and formula_64 - octupoles, and so on. The maxima of the scattering coefficients (as well as the change of their phase to formula_65) are called multipole resonances, and zeros can be called anapoles.

The dependence of the scattering cross-section on the wavelength and the contribution of specific resonances strongly depends on the particle material. For example, for a gold particle with a radius of 100 nm, the contribution of the electric dipole to scattering predominates in the optical range, while for a silicon particle there are pronounced magnetic dipole and quadrupole resonances. For metal particles, the peak visible in the scattering cross-section is also called localized plasmon resonance.

In the limit of small particles or long wavelengths, the electric dipole contribution dominates in the scattering cross-section.

=== Other directions of the incident plane wave ===
In case of &quot;x-&quot;polarized plane wave, incident along the &quot;z&quot;-axis, decompositions of all fields contained only harmonics with &quot;m&quot;= 1, but for an arbitrary incident wave this is not the case. For a rotated plane wave, the expansion coefficients can be obtained, for example, using the fact that during rotation, vector spherical harmonics are transformed through each other by Wigner D-matrixes.

In this case, the scattered field will be decomposed by all possible harmonics:

: formula_66

Then the scattering cross section will be expressed in terms of the coefficients as follows:
: formula_67

== Kerker effect ==
The &quot;Kerker effect&quot; is a phenomenon in scattering directionality, which occurs when different multipole responses are presented and not negligible.

In 1983, in the work of Kerker, Wang and Giles, the direction of scattering by particles with formula_68 was investigated. In particular, it was shown that for hypothetical particles with formula_69 backward scattering is completely suppressed. This can be seen as an extension to a spherical surface of Giles&#x27; and Wild&#x27;s results for reflection at a planar surface with equal refractive indices where reflection and transmission is constant and independent of angle of incidence.

In addition, scattering cross sections in the forward and backward directions are simply expressed in terms of Mie coefficients:
: formula_70

For certain combinations of coefficients, the expressions above can be minimized.

So, for example, when terms with formula_71 can be neglected (dipole approximation), formula_72, corresponds to the minimum in backscattering (magnetic and electric dipoles are equal in magnitude and are in phase, this is also called &quot;first Kerker&quot; or &quot;zero-backward intensity condition&quot;). And formula_73 corresponds to minimum in forward scattering, this is also called &quot;second Kerker condition&quot; (or &quot;near-zero forward intensity condition&quot;). From the optical theorem, it is shown that for a passive particle formula_74 is not possible. For the exact solution of the problem, it is necessary to take into account the contributions of all multipoles. The sum of the electric and magnetic dipoles forms Huygens source

For dielectric particles, maximum forward scattering is observed at wavelengths longer than the wavelength of magnetic dipole resonance, and maximum backward scattering at shorter ones. 

Later, other varieties of the effect were found. For example, the transverse Kerker effect, with nearly complete simultaneous
suppression of both forward and backward scattered fields (side-scattering patterns), optomechanical Kerker effect, in acoustic scattering, and also found in plants.

There is also a short with an explanation of the effect.

== Dyadic Green&#x27;s function of a sphere ==
Green&#x27;s function is a solution to the following equation:
: formula_75
where formula_76 — identity matrix formula_77 for formula_78, and formula_79 for formula_80. Since all fields are vectorial, the Green function is a 3 by 3 matrix and is called a dyadic. If polarization formula_81 is induced in the system, when the fields are written as 
: formula_82

In the same way as the fields, the Green&#x27;s function can be decomposed into vector spherical harmonics.
Dyadic Green&#x27;s function of a free space а:

: formula_83

In the presence of a sphere, the Green&#x27;s function is also decomposed into vector spherical harmonics. Its appearance depends on the environment in which the points formula_84 and formula_85 are located.

When both points are outside the sphere (formula_86):
: formula_87

where the coefficients are :
: formula_88

When both points are inside the sphere (formula_89) :
: formula_90

Coefficients:
: formula_91

Source is inside the sphere and observation point is outside (formula_92):
: formula_93

coefficients:
: formula_94

Source is outside the sphere and observation point is inside (formula_95) :
: formula_96

coefficients:
: formula_97

==Computational codes==
Mie solutions are implemented in a number of programs written in different computer languages such as Fortran, MATLAB, and Mathematica. These solutions approximate an infinite series, and provide as output the calculation of the scattering phase function, extinction, scattering, and absorption efficiencies, and other parameters such as asymmetry parameters or radiation torque. Current usage of the term &quot;Mie solution&quot; indicates a series approximation to a solution of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. There are several known objects that allow such a solution: spheres, concentric spheres, infinite cylinders, clusters of spheres and clusters of cylinders. There are also known series solutions for scattering by ellipsoidal particles. A list of codes implementing these specialized solutions is provided in the following:
* Codes for electromagnetic scattering by spheres – solutions for a single sphere, coated spheres, multilayer sphere, and cluster of spheres;
* Codes for electromagnetic scattering by cylinders – solutions for a single cylinder, multilayer cylinders, and cluster of cylinders.

A generalization that allows a treatment of more generally shaped particles is the T-matrix method, which also relies on a series approximation to solutions of Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

==Applications==
Mie theory is very important in meteorological optics, where diameter-to-wavelength ratios of the order of unity and larger are characteristic for many problems regarding haze and cloud scattering. A further application is in the characterization of particles by optical scattering measurements. The Mie solution is also important for understanding the appearance of common materials like milk, biological tissue and latex paint.

===Atmospheric science===
Mie scattering occurs when the diameters of atmospheric particulates are similar to or larger than the wavelengths of the light. Dust, pollen, smoke and microscopic water droplets that form clouds are common causes of Mie scattering. Mie scattering occurs mostly in the lower portions of the atmosphere, where larger particles are more abundant, and dominates in cloudy conditions.

===Cancer detection and screening===
Mie theory has been used to determine whether scattered light from tissue corresponds to healthy or cancerous cell nuclei using angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry.

===Clinical laboratory analysis===
Mie theory is a central principle in the application of nephelometric based assays, widely used in medicine to measure various plasma proteins. A wide array of plasma proteins can be detected and quantified by nephelometry.

===Magnetic particles===
A number of unusual electromagnetic scattering effects occur for magnetic spheres. When the relative permittivity equals the permeability, the back-scatter gain is zero. Also, the scattered radiation is polarized in the same sense as the incident radiation. In the small-particle (or long-wavelength) limit, conditions can occur for zero forward scatter, for complete polarization of scattered radiation in other directions, and for asymmetry of forward scatter to backscatter. The special case in the small-particle limit provides interesting special instances of complete polarization and forward-scatter-to-backscatter asymmetry.

===Metamaterial===
Mie theory has been used to design metamaterials. They usually consist of three-dimensional composites of metal or non-metallic inclusions periodically or randomly embedded in a low-permittivity matrix. In such a scheme, the negative constitutive parameters are designed to appear around the Mie resonances of the inclusions: the negative effective permittivity is designed around the resonance of the Mie electric dipole scattering coefficient, whereas negative effective permeability is designed around the resonance of the Mie magnetic dipole scattering coefficient, and doubly negative material (DNG) is designed around the overlap of resonances of Mie electric and magnetic dipole scattering coefficients. The particle usually have the following combinations:
# one set of magnetodielectric particles with values of relative permittivity and permeability much greater than one and close to each other;
# two different dielectric particles with equal permittivity but different size;
# two different dielectric particles with equal size but different permittivity.

In theory, the particles analyzed by Mie theory are commonly spherical but, in practice, particles are usually fabricated as cubes or cylinders for ease of fabrication. To meet the criteria of homogenization, which may be stated in the form that the lattice constant is much smaller than the operating wavelength, the relative permittivity of the dielectric particles should be much greater than 1, e.g. formula_98 to achieve negative effective permittivity (permeability).

===Particle sizing===
Mie theory is often applied in laser diffraction analysis to inspect the particle sizing effect. While early computers in the 1970s were only able to compute diffraction data with the more simple Fraunhofer approximation, Mie is widely used since the 1990s and officially recommended for particles below 50 micrometers in guideline ISO 13320:2009.

Mie theory has been used in the detection of oil concentration in polluted water.

Mie scattering is the primary method of sizing single sonoluminescing bubbles of air in water and is valid for cavities in materials, as well as particles in materials, as long as the surrounding material is essentially non-absorbing.

===Parasitology===
It has also been used to study the structure of &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, a particularly pathogenic form of malaria.

== Extensions ==
In 1986, P. A. Bobbert and J. Vlieger extended the Mie model to calculate scattering by a sphere in a homogeneous medium placed on flat surface: the Bobbert–Vlieger (BV) model. Like the Mie model, the extended model can be applied to spheres with a radius nearly the wavelength of the incident light. The model has been implemented in C++ source code. 
Recent developments are related to scattering by ellipsoid.
The contemporary studies go to well known research of Rayleigh.
