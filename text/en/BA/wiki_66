<text>Bleeding time is a medical test done to assess the function of a person&#x27;s platelets. It involves making a patient bleed, then timing how long it takes for them to stop bleeding using a stopwatch or other suitable devices.

The term template bleeding time is used when the test is performed to standardized parameters.

A newer alternative to the traditional bleeding time test is the platelet function screen performed on the PFA-100 analyzer.

==Usage==
The template bleeding time test is a method used when other more reliable and less invasive tests for determining coagulation are not available. Historically, it was used whenever physicians needed information about platelet activation.

==Process==
The test involves cutting the underside of the subject&#x27;s forearm, in an area where there is no hair or visible veins. The cut is of a standardized width and depth, and is done quickly by a template device.

===IVY method===

The IVY method is the traditional format for this test. While both the IVY and Duke&#x27;s method require the use of a sphygmomanometer, or blood pressure cuff, the IVY method is more invasive than the Duke method, utilizing an incision on the ventral side of the forearm, whereas the Duke method involves puncture with a lancet or special needle. In the IVY method, the blood pressure cuff is placed on the upper arm and inflated to 40 mmHg. A lancet or scalpel blade is used to make a shallow incision that is 1 millimeter deep on the underside of the forearm.

A standard-sized incision is made around 10 mm long and 1 mm deep. The time from when the incision is made until all bleeding has stopped is measured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30 seconds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw off the blood.

The test is finished when bleeding has stopped.

A prolonged bleeding time may be a result from decreased number of thrombocytes or impaired blood vessels. However, the depth of the puncture or incision may be the source of error.

Normal values fall between 3 – 10 minutes depending on the method used.

A disadvantage of Ivy&#x27;s method is closure of puncture wound before stoppage of bleeding.

===Duke&#x27;s method===

With the Duke&#x27;s method, the patient is pricked with a special needle or lancet, preferably on the earlobe or fingertip, after having been swabbed with alcohol. The prick is about 3–4 mm deep. The patient then wipes the blood every 30 seconds with a filter paper. The test ceases when bleeding ceases. The usual time is about 2–5 minutes.

This method is not recommended and cannot be standardized because it can cause a large local hematoma.

==Interpretation==
Bleeding time may be affected by platelet function, certain vascular disorders and von Willebrand Disease—not by other coagulation factors such as haemophilia. Diseases that may cause prolonged bleeding time include thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), Bernard-Soulier disease, and Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia.

Aspirin and other cyclooxygenase inhibitors can significantly prolong bleeding time. While warfarin and heparin have their major effects on coagulation factors, an increased bleeding time is sometimes seen with use of these medications as well.

People with von Willebrand disease usually experience increased bleeding time, as von Willebrand factor is a platelet adhesion protein, but this is not considered an effective diagnostic test for this condition.

It is also prolonged in hypofibrinogenemia.

==In popular culture==
In the British comedy film &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (1954), Sir Lancelot Spratt, the intimidating chief of surgery played by James Robertson Justice is asking instructional questions of his medical students. He asks a young student, who has been distracted by a pretty nurse, what &quot;the bleeding time&quot; is. The student looks at his watch and answers &quot;Ten past ten, sir.&quot;

<text>James W. Cockburn (February 13, 1819 – August 14, 1883) was a Canadian politician and a father of Canadian Confederation. He served as the first speaker of the House of Commons.

==Early life==
He was born in Berwick-Upon-Tweed on the English–Scottish border and immigrated to Canada with his father, James Cockburn Snr. (1787–1832), mother, Sarah Turnbull (1797–1866) and brother, Adam (1820–1860), at the age of 13. After attending Upper Canada College and Osgoode Hall, he established a law practice in Cobourg, Ontario.

==Career==
In the 1850s, Cockburn was elected to the town council. In 1861, he was elected to the Province of Canada&#x27;s legislative assembly as a Reformer representing Northumberland West. Despite elected as an opponent of the Macdonald–Cartier administration, Cockburn switched allegiances and became a supporter of Macdonald&#x27;s Liberal-Conservative Party.

Cockburn attended the Quebec Conference of 1864 as a supporter of Confederation. After Confederation, he was elected to the new House of Commons of Canada in the country&#x27;s first election. He was nominated by Sir John A. Macdonald to be Canada&#x27;s first speaker of the House of Commons, a position in which he served from 1867 to 1874.

His performance as Speaker was hindered by the fact that he spoke no French in a chamber in which both English and French were official languages. He did however understand French. In 1872, Cockburn was nominated for a second term as Speaker despite reservations by the Opposition that he had been too favourable to the government in his rulings. Cockburn lost his seat in the 1874 election that had been precipitated by the Pacific Scandal and that brought down the Macdonald government.

Cockburn won back his former seat in the 1878 election but did not take an active role in Parliament. He resigned in 1881 when he was appointed to collect and classify Canadian statutes but this assignment was cut short by his death.

==Personal life==
He married Isabella Susan Patterson in 1854 and they had three children: Sarah Isabella Cockburn, Francis Cockburn and May Cockburn.

<doc id="221657" wikidata="Q311031" url="?curid=221657" title="Andrea Pisano">
<text>Andrea Pisano (Pontedera 12901348 Orvieto) also known as Andrea da Pontedera, was an Italian sculptor and architect.

==Biography==
Pisano initially learned the trade of a goldsmith. He later became an apprentice of Mino di Giovanni, about 1300, and worked with him on the sculpture for S. Maria della Spina at Pisa and elsewhere. He produced his main works in Florence. It is assumed that Giotto di Bondone was eventually more influential on his style than his earlier teacher. He produced the first (southside) of the three bronze doors of the Baptistery in Florence. He worked on this major project between 1330-1336. The door consists of a number of small quatrefoil panels, the lower eight containing single figures of the Virtues, and the rest scenes from the life of John the Baptist.

Andrea Pisano, while living in Florence, also produced many important works of marble sculpture, all of which show Giotto&#x27;s influence. In 1340 he succeeded Giotto as Master of the Works of Florence&#x27;s Cathedral. There he produced a series of reliefs, possibly designed by his former teacher, including the double band of panel-reliefs which Pisano executed for the great campanile. The subjects of these are the &quot;Four Great Prophets&quot;, the &quot;Seven Virtues&quot;, the &quot;Seven Sacraments&quot;, the &quot;Seven Works of Mercy&quot; and the &quot;Seven Planets&quot;. The duomo contains the most important works of Pisano in marble. In 1347 he became Master of the Works at Orvieto Cathedral, which had already been designed and begun by Lorenzo Maitani. These and the cathedral&#x27;s doors are Pisano&#x27;s only surviving works. Pisano is known for contributing to freeing modern art from Byzantine influence. He died in 1348.

Andrea Pisano had two sons, Nino and Tommaso. Both eventually succeeded him as Master of the Works at Orvieto Cathedral.

Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Andrea Pisano in his &quot;Lives&quot;.

Pisano&#x27;s nost famous apprentice was Andrea di Cione, better known as Andrea Orcagna. Another of his apprentices, Giovanni di Balduccio, executed the shrine of Sant&#x27;Eustorgio in Milan.

<doc id="221659" wikidata="Q1026944" url="?curid=221659" title="California State University, San Bernardino">
<text>California State University, San Bernardino (Cal State San Bernardino or CSUSB) is a public research university in San Bernardino, California. Founded in 1965, it is part of the California State University system. The main campus sits on in the University District of San Bernardino, with a branch campus of in Palm Desert, California, opened in 1986. Cal State San Bernardino&#x27;s fall 2020 enrollment was 19,404. In fall 2019, it had 505 full-time faculty, of which 385 (76 percent) were on the tenure track.

The university is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;, offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 123 programs, master&#x27;s degrees in 61 programs, two Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) programs (Community College specialization and K–12 specialization), and 23 teaching credentials.

CSUSB&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Coyotes and play in the California Collegiate Athletic Association in the Division II of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The nickname was inspired by the coyotes that inhabit the area around the campus, which lies in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The CSUSB women&#x27;s volleyball team has won thirteen CCAA titles, eight West Region titles and a national title. The men&#x27;s soccer team went to the NCAA Division II national semi-finals, capturing the university&#x27;s first California Collegiate Athletic Association title. The university is a Hispanic-serving institution.

==History==
California State University, San Bernardino was created by the state legislature on April 29, 1960, as the San Bernardino-Riverside State College. Later, the California State College system&#x27;s board of trustees chose a site in the city of San Bernardino. In 1963 and the college&#x27;s official name was changed to California State College at San Bernardino. It opened in 1965 with 293 students and 30 faculty members. CSUSB earned its university status in 1984, officially becoming California State University, San Bernardino. Today, the university has more than 18,000 students and 84,000 alumni.

==Campus==
Built atop of bedrock on the city&#x27;s north side, CSUSB is framed to the north by the San Bernardino Mountains.
More than of new facilities have been built to meet students&#x27; academic and social needs. Campus residential housing provides more than 1,500 beds.

A new College of Education building opened in 2008. The Santos Manuel Student Union has doubled in size in recent years, and a new Student Recreation and Fitness Center was completed in 2007. Other recently constructed facilities include the Social and Behavioral Sciences and Chemical Sciences buildings.

The John M. Pfau Library, named after the university&#x27;s first president, sits at the very center of the campus. Other distinctive university landmarks include: the clock tower above the Santos Manuel Student Union, the Robert V. Fullerton Art Museum, and the James &amp; Aerianthi Coussoulis Arena, a modern, 4,000-plus seat sports and events venue—one of the largest indoor arenas in the Inland Empire.

In 2009, the university received a major donation from the Pauline Murillo family to construct a $2 million research observatory on the campus. The W.M. Keck Foundation and the California Portland Cement Co. also made substantial contributions. The university is a Hispanic-serving institution.

===Robert and Frances Fullerton Museum of Art===
The Robert and Frances Fullerton Museum of Art (formerly the Robert V. Fullerton Art Museum) is among the 4 percent of museums in the United States accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. The RAFFMA&#x27;s permanent collections consist of three distinct kinds of art: ancient, ceramic, and contemporary. A world-class collection of about 200 Egyptian artifacts and a smaller selection of Italian pottery are part of the museum&#x27;s permanent holdings. Rotating shows feature artists from throughout the region and country. One gallery of the museum is dedicated to exhibiting the work of the school&#x27;s own art students. The museum celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2016 and received accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums in 2008.

===Palm Desert Campus===
Opened in 1986, the California State University, San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus in Palm Desert, California () hosts upper-division undergraduate and graduate students. Many of them come from the Coachella Valley and Joshua Tree areas. Since its inception, the Palm Desert Campus has maintained a close relationship with the nearby College of the Desert. The majority of Palm Desert Campus undergraduate students have transferred from College of the Desert through a dual admissions program.

A health sciences building for the four-year nursing program opened on the Palm Desert Campus in October 2008.

The Palm Desert Campus was built entirely with private funds. This public-private partnership was featured in a front-page story in the Sunday, August 3, 2003, edition of the New York Times.

===Murillo Family Observatory===
The Murillo Family Observatory is a teaching and research observatory at CSUSB, located on Badger Hill on the northern portion of campus. It is the newest research observatory in the Inland Empire and in the California State University system. The observatory consists of two telescopes which are used for research and teaching; a 20-inch Ritchey-Chretien and a 17-inch Corrected Dall-Kirkham Astrograph. In addition to the research telescopes the observatory has an observation deck with piers where small telescopes may be set up for undergraduate laboratory classes or open house nights. It serves as both an academic and community resource, with public viewing nights and special astronomy events for the community.

==Organization and administration==
San Bernardino-Riverside State College became a part of the California College System (now called the California State University system) in 1965 and eventually became California State University, San Bernardino. It, along with 22 other campuses, now forms the California State University system, which is the largest senior system of higher education in the United States.

The current president is Tomas Morales, who was chosen in 2012. A graduate of SUNY New Paltz, he serves on the boards of directors of the American Council on Education, and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, for which he is chair.
==Academics==

The university offers degree, credential, and certificate programs. It is divided into three Liberal Arts colleges,
*College of Arts and Letters
*College of Natural Sciences
*College of Social and Behavioral Sciences

and three vocational colleges:
*Jack H. Brown College of Business and Public Administration
*College of Education
*College of Extended Learning

Popular majors for undergraduates in 2018 included Business Administration (Management and Operations) at 23.01%, Psychology (General) at 14.31%, Criminal Justice and Corrections at 6.40%. For graduates, popular majors included Business Administration, Management and Operations at 17.47%, Social Work at 14.21%, and Education (General) at 10.82%.

The five most popular majors for 2019 graduates were:

* Business, Management, Marketing, and related support services at 25%
* Psychology at 14%
* Social Sciences at 10%
* Health Professions and related programs at 7%
* Homeland Security, Law Enforcement, Firefighting and related protective services at 6%

Cal State San Bernardino has taken a role in furthering the study and understanding Middle Eastern Cultures, and is the only CSU campus offering Arabic language and Islamic history courses. CSUSB&#x27;s University Center for Developmental Disabilities is a clinical training program that provides evaluation, assessment, training, and support for autistic children, their parents, and siblings. CSUSB also offers a burgeoning program in Egyptology, with a Certificate in Egyptology offered through the Department of History and the opportunity to learn about Ancient Egypt at the Robert and Frances Fullerton Museum of Art RAFFMA that houses one of the largest collections of ancient Egyptian objects on the West Coast.

===Business and National Security Studies===

Many CSUSB programs have earned specialized national and international accreditation, including the business program, which was the first in the Inland Empire to gain AACSB accreditation at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. AACSB accreditation represents the highest standard of achievement for business schools worldwide. Less than 5% of the world&#x27;s 13,000 business programs have earned AACSB accreditation. AACSB-accredited schools produce graduates that are highly skilled and more desirable to employers than other non-accredited schools. The business and entrepreneurship programs are nationally recognized, as evidenced by CSUSB&#x27;s 2006 ranking of fourth in the United States for graduate entrepreneur programs. The university&#x27;s College of Business and Public Administration was also listed in the 2008 edition and the 2013 edition of The Princeton Review&#x27;s &quot;Best 290 Business Schools&quot;. In 2011, California State University, San Bernardino&#x27;s Jack H. Brown College of Business and Public Administration was recognized by European CEO Magazine as one of the top 20 schools of business in the world and one of the world&#x27;s 18 most innovative business schools.

The National Security Studies master of arts program is a nationally renown, two-year program that offers a comprehensive curriculum for students interested in pursuing careers in national service. It is one of three such programs in the country and the only one in the California State University system. The university also has collaborative educational programs with nearby Fort Irwin.
In addition, CSUSB&#x27;s advanced accounting students provide free tax preparation services to local low-income, elderly, disabled, non-English-speaking residents.

===Jack Brown Hall===
Many business and public administration classes take place in Jack Brown Hall, which was funded by Jack Brown, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Stater Bros., and opened on September 23, 1991. Jack Brown pledged $1 million to building enhancements in 1992, which was the largest donation CSUSB had ever received at the time; as a result, CSUSB named the building after him. He also provided student scholarships.

===Education===
The university is one of the region&#x27;s largest teacher-training institutions. In 2007, the university welcomed its first class of doctoral degree candidates. The Ed.D. in educational leadership is a research-based program that prepares pre-K through 12 and community college leaders to contribute to the study, development and implementation of educational reforms.

===Admissions, enrollment and retention===
Admission to CSUSB is based on a combination of the applicant&#x27;s high school cumulative grade point average (GPA) and standardized test scores. These factors are used to determine the applicant&#x27;s California State University (CSU) eligibility index. More specifically, the eligibility index is a weighted combination of high school grade point average during the final three years of high school and a score on either the SAT or ACT. The average grade point average for incoming freshmen was 3.34. The average composite ACT score was 20 and the average SAT score was 900. Overall, 58.2% of applicants are accepted to CSUSB.

Enrollment has increased by more than a third in recent years, and freshman enrollment has doubled. Due to the large number of applicants in the fall 2010 quarter, CSUSB declared &quot;campus impaction&quot; for the first time in its history.

More than 70 percent of CSUSB students are the first generation of their families to attend college. Latino and African American student enrollments are the third highest of any university in California.

CSUSB students are awarded on average 13 percent of CSU system scholarships, despite representing only 4 percent of the CSU&#x27;s overall enrollment. 57 percent of full-time undergraduate students at CSUSB receive sufficient scholarships and grants to pay all fees and another 10 percent pay less than the full fees. Almost 75 percent of CSUSB students receive financial aid.

More than three-quarters of the incoming 2009 freshmen class required remediation in either English or math, or both.

===President&#x27;s Academic Excellence Scholarship program===
Initiated in 2002 by university president, Albert K. Karnig, the President&#x27;s Academic Excellence Scholarship program invites the top 1 percent of graduating high school seniors in San Bernardino County to attend Cal State San Bernardino. The program provides a full scholarship, including tuition, books and a small stipend, to eligible students and is renewable for up to four academic years. The program is designed to attract the best and brightest students to CSUSB who might otherwise be lured to colleges outside the area. , there were 132 enrolled presidential scholars. The first major donor to this program was Evelyn Magnuson, who extended her legacy in 2008 through a planned gift, making CSUSB a beneficiary of her $2.4 million estate.

<text>Abbotsford is a city in British Columbia next to the Canada–United States border, Greater Vancouver, and the Fraser River. With a census population of 153,569 people (2021), it is the most populous municipality in the province outside metropolitan Vancouver. Abbotsford–Mission has the third-highest proportion of visible minorities among census metropolitan areas in Canada, after the Greater Toronto Area and the Greater Vancouver CMA. It is home to Tradex, the University of the Fraser Valley, and Abbotsford International Airport.

As of the 2021 census, it is the largest municipality of the Fraser Valley Regional District and the fifth-largest municipality of British Columbia. The Abbotsford–Mission metropolitan area of around 195,726 inhabitants as of the 2021 census is the 23rd largest census metropolitan area in Canada. It has also been named by Statistics Canada as Canada&#x27;s most generous city in terms of charitable donations for nine straight years.

The community of is the largest city by area in British Columbia. The municipality&#x27;s southern boundary is the Canada–United States border. In Canada, it is bordered by the Township of Langley to the west, the City of Mission to the north, and the City of Chilliwack to the east. Abbotsford borders the town of Sumas, Washington, to the south. Much of Abbotsford has views of Mount Baker (to the southeast, in Washington) and the Coast Mountains (to the north).

== History ==
===Settlement===
The first residents of the area are the Stó:lō Nation. The Upper Sumas 6 Indian reserve of the Sumas First Nation is located at Kilgard within Abbotsford city limits.

European settlement began when the Royal Engineers surveyed the area in response to the gold rush along the Fraser River in 1858. This led to the building of Yale Road (today Old Yale Road), the first transportation route to link the Fraser Valley. The settlement grew and the production of butter, milk and tobacco began by the late 1860s. In 1889, former Royal Engineer John Cunningham Maclure applied for a Crown grant to obtain the that would become Abbotsford.

The Gur Sikh Temple, located on 33089 South Fraser Way, is the oldest Sikh temple in North America. Built in 1908 and opened in 1911, it is now over 110 years old, outlasting the now demolished 2nd Avenue temple in Vancouver (opened in 1908), and the Golden temple (opened in 1905) which was destroyed by fire.

There is some controversy over the origin of the Abbotsford name. The most commonly cited origin is that Maclure named the land &quot;Abbotsford&quot; after family friend Henry Braithwaite Abbott, the western superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Maclure&#x27;s sons later stated that the property had actually been named for Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s home, Abbotsford House, and pronounced it with the accent on &quot;ford&quot;, In his later years Maclure himself claimed that the naming had been &quot;a combination of two ideas&quot;. The Akriggs say that Maclure in an 1894 letter said that when the town was laid out in 1894, the town was named for Henry Abbott, general superintendent of the CPR and brother of Sir John Abbott, prime minister.

=== Contemporary period ===

The title passed hands to Robert Ward, who filed a townsite subdivision on July 9, 1891. Also in 1891, the CPR built a railway line through the area that connected Mission with the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway at Sumas, Washington. This route was the only rail connection between Vancouver and Seattle until 1904. The Village of Abbotsford was incorporated in 1892. At that time Robert Ward sold many of the lots to private investors, but also sold off a significant portion to the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s subsidiary company the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway. The British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) arrived in 1910. The Interurban, as the BCER tram linking Abbotsford with Vancouver and Chilliwack was called, was discontinued in 1950, but BCER&#x27;s successor BC Hydro retains the right to re-introduce passenger rail service. Service to Vancouver runs from neighbouring Mission by way of the West Coast Express.

The most notable natural disaster to hit Abbotsford was a major flood of the Fraser River in 1948.

In September 1984, Pope John Paul II held an open-air Mass for over 200,000 people at Abbotsford International Airport.

The amalgamation of the Village of Abbotsford and the District of Sumas into the District of Abbotsford occurred in 1972. The District of Abbotsford amalgamated with the District of Matsqui in 1995 to become the City of Abbotsford, raising the population significantly.

In June 2013, the City of Abbotsford spread chicken manure on a homeless camp located in the city. Abbotsford Mayor Bruce Banman publicly apologized for the incident.

The city of Abbotsford has a long and ongoing history of gang-related crime, particularly that of violence and the illegal sale of controlled substances.

On November 16, 2021, Abbotsford residents living in the Sumas Prairie were given an evacuation order given the flooding in British Columbia at the time, the city calling the situation &quot;catastrophic&quot;.

==Government==

Abbotsford City Council comprises a council-manager form of local government. The mayor and council were last elected in 2022. The current mayor is Ross Siemens.

The Abbotsford flag and coat of arms are the same, featuring straight, diagonal crosses representing Abbotsford as at a &quot;crossroads&quot;. At the centre is a strawberry blossom to symbolize the local berry industry. The flag of Abbotsford was originally blue in colour. The change to green was initiated in 1995 when the District of Abbotsford and the District of Matsqui amalgamated to create the City of Abbotsford.

The metropolitan area had the highest rate of homicides nationally for two years running (2008 and 2009) with a rate of 5.22 homicides per 100,000 population, compared with the national average of 1.81. In 2010, the rate was 2.3.

The City of Abbotsford has its own municipal police force, one of eleven municipal police forces in British Columbia. It is the third-largest municipal police force in British Columbia (behind Vancouver and Victoria). , the Abbotsford Police Department employed nearly 200 officers and 80 civilian employees.

The Abbotsford Police Department was officially formed in 1995 when the District of Matsqui and the District of Abbotsford amalgamated to become the City of Abbotsford. Prior to the amalgamation, the District of Matsqui was patrolled by the Matsqui police and the District of Abbotsford by the RCMP. During the referendum citizens elected to keep a municipal police force.

<text>Woodbridge Nathan Ferris (January 6, 1853March 23, 1928) was an American educator from New York, Illinois and Michigan who served as the 28th governor of Michigan and in the United States Senate as a Democrat. He was the founder and namesake of Ferris State University.

==Early life==
Woodbridge N. Ferris was born in a log cabin near Spencer, New York, on January 6, 1853, the first of seven children born to John Ferris Jr. and Estella (Reed) Ferris. He was raised and educated in Spencer, and at age 14 enrolled in Spencer Academy. At age 16, he attended a teacher&#x27;s institute in Waverly and received his teaching credentials. After a year of teaching, he decided to further his education at the academy in Owego.

From 1870 to 1873, Woodbridge attended the Oswego Normal Training School (now State University of New York at Oswego). At Oswego, Woodbridge&#x27;s professors included Hermann Krusi, an instructor of drawing and geometry; Krusi&#x27;s father had been chief assistant to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi at Pestalozzi&#x27;s school in Switzerland. Krusi taught Woodbridge the Pestalozzi method of learning by hands on application rather than theoretical lectures, a concept Woodbridge continued to employ throughout his career as an educator.

==Start of career==
After graduating from the Oswego normal school, Woodbridge returned to Spencer, where he became principal of the village&#x27;s academy. After a year as principal, Ferris attended the University of Michigan Medical School from 1873 to 1874. In December 1874, he married Helen Frances Gillespie, whom he met at Oswego, and who taught at the academy in Spencer while he was principal. The couple had three sons: Carleton Gillespie (1876–1961), Clifford Wendell (1881, died just after three months), and Phelps Fitch (1889–1935). Ferris taught again at Spencer Academy from 1874 to 1875.

In 1875, Ferris moved to Freeport, Illinois to become principal of the Freeport Business College and Academy. In 1876, he became principal of the Normal Department of Rock River University. In 1877, he co-founded the Dixon Business College and Academy of Dixon, Illinois. In 1879, Ferris became superintendent of schools in Pittsfield, Illinois, where he remained until 1884.

==Continued career==
In 1884, Ferris settled in Big Rapids, Michigan, where he established the Ferris Industrial School (now Ferris State University). Ferris served as president of the school until his death, and became so identified with it that he was nicknamed &quot;The Big Rapids Schoolmaster&quot;. He was also president of the Big Rapids Savings Bank.

During the Panic of 1893, Ferris experienced financial setbacks and his school was on the verge of closing, but several former students loaned him the money to continue. The institution was subsequently incorporated, and Ferris was able to capitalize it at $50,000 (almost $2 million in 2024). The Ferris school was a success, and its reputation became known nationwide. Over time, it expanded to include several well-regarded departments, among them English, business, pharmacy, civil service, elocution, music, and college preparatory.

In 1892, Ferris was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the U.S. House from Michigan&#x27;s 11th district. In 1904, he was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Michigan against Republican Fred M. Warner. He was a delegate to the 1908 Democratic National Convention, and he was again a delegate to the 1912 convention.

==Governor of Michigan==

Ferris was elected governor of Michigan in 1912, becoming the first Democratic governor in 20 years, and he served from 1913 to 1917. During his tenure, several reforms were introduced, including a farm colony for epileptics and the Central Michigan Tuberculosis Sanatorium. In addition, the bitter Copper Country Strike of 1913–1914 occurred during Ferris&#x27;s tenure. After a sustained period of violence between striking miners and a combination of strikebreakers and supporters of the mine owners, Ferris deployed the National Guard, which stayed in the area for more than a year, an action that provoked confrontations between strikers and troops. The violence between strikers and strikebreakers, and strikers and the National Guard revealed the need for a sustained law enforcement presence in northern Michigan, which led to the post-strike creation of the Michigan State Police.

In 1914, Ferris was named honorary president of the First National Conference on Race Betterment, a meeting about eugenics held at the Battle Creek Sanatorium; because of the mine strike was still ongoing, he did not attend the conference. In 1916, he was again a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Ferris&#x27;s successful governorship and his easy to recognize appearance—tall, with a full head of silver-gray hair—led to the nickname the &quot;Good Gray Governor&quot;.

==U.S. Senator==
Helen Ferris died on March 23, 1917. In 1920, Ferris was an unsuccessful candidate for governor, being defeated by Alex Groesbeck. On August 14, 1921, he married Mary E. McCloud (1882–1954). Ferris was the recipient of several honorary degrees, including a master of pedagogy from Michigan State Normal College, and LL.D.s from Olivet College, the University of Michigan, and the University of Notre Dame.

In 1922, Ferris was elected to the United States Senate for the term beginning on March 4, 1923. Appointed to the Committee On Education and Labor, Ferris supported the establishment of a federal Department of Education. In 1924, Ferris was again a delegate to the Democratic National Convention; he was Michigan&#x27;s favorite son candidate for president, and received 30 votes on the first ballot. The nomination went to John W. Davis, who lost the general election to Calvin Coolidge.

==Death==
In early March 1928, Ferris announced that he would not be a candidate for reelection to the senate. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 23, 1928. Ferris was interred at Highlandview Cemetery in Big Rapids, as were his first wife and his sons Carleton and Phelps.

<doc id="221665" wikidata="Q465917" url="?curid=221665" title="Nanni di Banco">
<text>Giovanni di Antonio di Banco, called Nanni di Banco ( 1374 – 1421), was an Italian Renaissance sculptor from Florence. He was a contemporary of Donatello – both are first recorded as sculptors in the accounts of the Florence Duomo in 1406, presumably as young masters. He is one of the artists whose work manifested the transition from Gothic to Renaissance art in the city, finding inspiration in classical Roman sculpture and bringing a new naturalism to Florentine art.

== Early life ==

Nanni di Banco, born probably about 1374 in Florence, was the son of Antonio di Banco and Giovanna Succhielli. Antonio married Giovanna in 1368 and joined the stonemasons&#x27; guild in 1372. He was employed for many years in the building works (&quot;Fabbrica di Santa Maria del Fiore&quot;) of Florence Cathedral as a &quot;quarryman, stonemason, master builder, and designer&quot;. He ran the family workshop in the Sant&#x27;Ambrogio parish while Giovanna owned a farm in the parish of Santa Maria a Settignano. She also came from a long line of stonemasons who had important offices in the Fabbrica di S. Maria del Fiore.

Nanni received the training typical of a Florentine artisan, being descended from stonemasons who were active in the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore. His grandfather Banco di Falco and his great-uncle Agostino di Falco are listed as masters in Opera del Duomo documents concerning construction of the cathedral and the bell tower. Nanni&#x27;s father, Antonio, procured materials for the cathedral and worked on its decorative carvings. According to Mary Bergstein, Nanni di Banco probably began working as a stonemason in the last decade of the 14th century in the family workshop and then in the Opera di S. Maria del Fiore under the master builders Lorenzo di Filippo and Giovanni d&#x27;Ambrogio, respectively. He joined the stonemasons&#x27; and woodworkers&#x27; guild (&quot;arte dei maestri di pietra e legname&quot;) in 1405, and is first noticed in the cathedral documents (1406–1408) during the second phase or &quot;campaign&quot; of the decoration of the Porta della Mandorla (Almond Gate). He sculpted the archivolt of the door in which a Christ in Pity (&quot;Cristo in pietà&quot;) or Man of Sorrows is carved on the keystone at the top of the frieze and framed by a pentagon (1407–1409).

Although Nanni worked with Donatello, Donatello was not, as Giorgio Vasari thought, Nanni&#x27;s instructor. Most of his training likely took place within the circle of Florentine masons, stonecutters, and sculptors at work on the Cathedral, and in particular in the context of the work known to have started in 1391 on the decoration of the north door, later called the Porta della Mandorla. Giovanni d&#x27;Ambrogio, whose work, according to Kreytenberg, &quot;provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of Renaissance sculpture&quot;, has been described by Manfred Wundram as the &quot;true mentor of Donatello, and even more so of Nanni di Banco&quot;.

Nanni di Banco&#x27;s father Antonio attained the position of chief foreman (&quot;capomaestro&quot;) of the cathedral building works, and served as consul of the Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e Legname (Stonemasons&#x27; and Woodworkers&#x27; Guild) seven times. Nanni followed his father into the guild in 1405, membership of which gave him status as a qualified sculptor and allowed him to work as such at the cathedral. He would serve as a guild consul five times over the course of his career. Nanni and his father were commissioned to carve the statue of the prophet Isaiah for the cathedral in January 1408.

Antonio was not only a salaried employee of the cathedral workshop but was also a subcontractor who supplied building materials to the &quot;Opera del Duomo&quot;. His name appeared on the cathedral payroll in 1395 along with those of Niccolò Lamberti, Lorenzo di Filippo, and Giovanni d&#x27;Ambrogio, accomplished masters active in the first campaign of work on the Porta della Mandorla. About this time Nanni likely carved the small Hercules on a lower panel of the portal, while Antonio produced the frieze of the archivolt, for which Nanni later sculpted the keystone with the Man of Sorrows in 1407–1409.

After the completion of the cathedral&#x27;s northwest tribune in 1407–1408, several stonemasons, including Antonio di Banco, were commissioned by the Operai to adorn the spurs of the buttresses with twelve life-sized statues of Old Testament prophets. On 24 January 1408, Antonio and his son Nanni received the commission to carve the first, a marble Isaiah which was to set the standard for the other figures. Nanni did all the actual carving. A month later, Donatello was commissioned to sculpt a companion piece, a statue of equal size depicting David as prophet. At the time, Donatello was twenty-two and had been active in the workshop of Lorenzo Ghiberti. Both of the statues were to be placed on the dome tribune on the north side of the Duomo. A resolution issued on 20 February 1408 stipulated that the &quot;David&quot; should be carved in the same manner, under the same conditions, and at the same rate of pay as the statue carved by Nanni. Nonetheless, Donatello was subsequently paid more for his work than Nanni was for his &quot;Isaiah&quot;. According to Janson, this was because Donatello&#x27;s statue included the additional feature of Goliath&#x27;s head.

Over the course of a year and a half, Nanni had sculpted the &quot;Isaiah&quot;, the first known full-length statue of the biblical prophet, and Donatello had carved his marble &quot;David&quot;. Both statues depict a biblical prophet as a youth, and share a Gothic sway in pose with a corresponding arrangement of drapery on the body. It is not known why the &quot;Isaiah&quot; was situated and then removed. Donatello&#x27;s marble &quot;David&quot; remained at the Opera del Duomo until July 1416, when it was given to the Priors of the Arts (&quot;Priori delle arti&quot;) and moved to the Palazzo della Signoria. The work, identified by Jenö Lányi as the &quot;David&quot;, was transferred to the Bargello in the 1870s. The whereabouts of Nanni&#x27;s &quot;Isaiah&quot; remained unknown until Lányi showed in 1936 that it must have been the statue in the nave of the church on the right side of the entrance, moved there after the facade was demolished in 1587. Antonio was appointed &quot;capomaestro&quot; of the Cathedral workshop in 1413 and the next year Nanni received the commission for the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; on the gable of the Porta della Mandorla. According to Margaret Haines, this was hardly a coincidence.

Nanni was elected podestà of the Florentine parish of Castelfranco di Sopra in the river Arno valley for six months starting in July 1416. After his term was up, he became consul of the Stonemasons&#x27; and Woodworkers&#x27; Guild beginning in January 1417, and one year later he was re-elected. During this period Nanni was completing the &quot;Quattro Santi Coronati&quot;, working assiduously on the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; and beginning to carve the &quot;Saint Eligius&quot; in Orsanmichele for the blacksmiths&#x27; guild. 

In May 1419 the Operai del duomo paid Nanni for two reliefs he had carved depicting the arms of the Agnus Dei (wool guild). These were part of a sculptural assembly for the facade of the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella. That summer he carved four more reliefs for Agnus Dei by a direct commission to adorn some farmhouses outside the Porta Pisana that had been willed to the guild. The following September he was again elected consul of the stonemasons&#x27; guild. Nanni was most actively involved in civic affairs when he was working on a marble statue of Saint Eligius for the tabernacle of the farriers in Orsanmichele.

On 12 September 1419 Nanni&#x27;s was elected to the Dodici Bonomini, a committee of &#x27;&quot;Twelve Good Men&quot;, which included three representatives elected from each of the four quarters of the city – they were advisors to the Signoria and had substantial authority. On 16 January 1421, Nanni was summoned to join the Council of Two Hundred, a group formed in support of the Albizzi ruling family. He was intended to hold this position for six months, but a month after he was elected on 9 February 1421, he wrote his will and died within a few days.

=== Works ===

Nanni di Banco made a name for himself in the transition from International Gothic art to Renaissance art, marking a path for the Early Renaissance in Florence. Many of his works are displayed inside the Cathedral and in the Church and Museum of Orsanmichele in Florence. His first major work was a statue of the prophet Isaiah, as identified by Jenö Lányi, in 1408 for a buttress of the Cathedral.

Antonio was a member of the commission formed on 2 June 1407 to oversee the decoration of the cathedral&#x27;s north tribune. Consequently, Nanni was active for the Opera del duomo at the time, working alongside his father and executing the &quot;Cristo in pietà&quot; and the &quot;Isaia&quot; (&quot;Isaiah&quot;). To maintain sole authority over their projects, the &quot;Operai&quot; as a matter of course organized them as joint enterprises among the painters, sculptors, and architects involved, denying any single participant a free hand and encouraging them to collaborate. This approach caused the artists to compete with each another and to seek recognition for the excellence of their work, leading to greater efficiency in completing the programs and thereby keeping costs lower. Nanni carved &quot;St. Luke&quot; (&quot;San Luca&quot;), a statue of the Christian evangelist, as part of a commission by the &quot;Operai&quot; in 1408 for the creation of four seated marble Evangelists to flank the facade of the main entrance to the cathedral, a series which included Donatello&#x27;s &quot;St. John&quot;, Bernardo Ciuffagni&#x27;s &quot;St. Matthew&quot; and Niccolò di Pietro Lamberti&#x27;s &quot;St. Mark&quot;.

Nanni took the opportunity to exploit a new approach of expressing human feeling with themes of humanism in sculpture, the influence of this philosophical movement being expressed in the outline and in the human face through posture and shadowing. The project to create the set of the four evangelists is documented from purchase of the marble (1405–1407) until the relocation of the statues in the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo after World War II. One of the earliest examples of the development of &quot;contrapposto&quot; in the Quattrocento is Nanni&#x27;s &quot;Saint Philip&quot;, a standing, draped figure, located on the north side of Orsanmichele.

Nanni di Banco was a contemporary of Donatello and Lorenzo Ghiberti. He is well known for his sculpture group &quot;Four Crowned Saints&quot; (&quot;Quattro Santi Coronati&quot;, c. 1416) which was commissioned by the stone carvers and wood workers guild for the Church of Orsanmichele. Demonstrating his familiarity with antique prototypes of formal sculpture, Nanni depicted the four saints, sculptors who were martyred in the 4th century, as if they were Roman philosophers or senators. The significance of this work is manifested not only in the striking naturalism and individuality of the figures, but also in the complexity of construction of a sculpture group, for which he copied the swagged cloth seen behind the figures of a Roman sarcophagus from the 3rd century. According to Mary Bergstein, Nanni di Banco&#x27;s body of sculptural work &quot;in many ways determined the course of Renaissance art in Florence&quot;. 

The &quot;Quattro Coronati&quot; was created c. 1409 to 1416–17. Nanni&#x27;s rendering of the four saints, patron saints of the stone carvers and wood workers guild, mostly ignores the confused legend on which it is based, that of the martyrs of Pannonia, who, during the reign of Diocletian chose to die rather than follow his command to carve an image of the god Asclepius. The sculpture depicts the four men, wearing sandals and togas in the ancient Roman style, engaged in serious, agreeable conversation. The relief carved on the plinth on which the figures stand depicts stonemasons, stonecutters, and bricklayers at work, also wearing clothes of the period. This relief was modeled on a Roman funerary stele depicting such craftsmen.

Although Nanni and Donatello were regarded by some of their contemporaries as bitter rivals during the first two decades of the &quot;Quattrocento&quot;, Bergstein says there is documentary evidence in the cathedral records that indicates friendship and a harmonious working relationship between Nanni, Donatello, and Filippo Brunelleschi. Nanni acted, for example, as Donatello&#x27;s guarantor to the Opera del Duomo for payments made in advance for work on the &quot;Prophets&quot; series in the campanile. The trio were paid 45 gold florins in 1419 for preparing a large model of Brunelleschi&#x27;s dome constructed of brick. Nanni and Donatello served on an Opera del Duomo committee four months later to evaluate Brunelleschi&#x27;s design for the dome.

Vasari includes a biography of Nanni di Banco in his &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;.

<doc id="221669" wikidata="Q1142285" url="?curid=221669" title="Darcy–Weisbach equation">
<text>In fluid dynamics, the Darcy–Weisbach equation is an empirical equation that relates the head loss, or pressure loss, due to friction along a given length of pipe to the average velocity of the fluid flow for an incompressible fluid. The equation is named after Henry Darcy and Julius Weisbach. Currently, there is no formula more accurate or universally applicable than the Darcy-Weisbach supplemented by the Moody diagram or Colebrook equation.

The Darcy–Weisbach equation contains a dimensionless friction factor, known as the Darcy friction factor. This is also variously called the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor, friction factor, resistance coefficient, or flow coefficient.

==Historical background==
The Darcy-Weisbach equation, combined with the Moody chart for calculating head losses in pipes, is traditionally attributed to Henry Darcy, Julius Weisbach, and Lewis Ferry Moody. However, the development of these formulas and charts also involved other scientists and engineers over its historical development. Generally, the Bernoulli&#x27;s equation would provide the head losses but in terms of quantities not known a priori, such as pressure. Therefore, empirical relationships were sought to correlate the head loss with quantities like pipe diameter and fluid velocity.

Julius Weisbach was certainly not the first to introduce a formula correlating the length and diameter of a pipe to the square of the fluid velocity. Antoine Chézy (1718-1798), in fact, had published a formula in 1770 that, although referring to open channels (i.e., not under pressure), was formally identical to the one Weisbach would later introduce, provided it was reformulated in terms of the hydraulic radius. However, Chézy&#x27;s formula was lost until 1800, when Gaspard de Prony (a former student of his) published an account describing his results. It is likely that Weisbach was aware of Chézy&#x27;s formula through Prony&#x27;s publications.

Weisbach&#x27;s formula was proposed in 1845 in the form we still use today:
:formula_1
where:
*formula_2: head loss.
*formula_3: length of the pipe.
*formula_4: diameter of the pipe.
*formula_5: velocity of the fluid.
*formula_6: acceleration due to gravity.
However, the friction factor f was expressed by Weisbach through the following empirical formula:
:formula_7
with formula_8 and formula_9 depending on the diameter and the type of pipe wall.
Weisbach&#x27;s work was published in the United States of America in 1848 and soon became well known there. In contrast, it did not initially gain much traction in France, where Prony equation, which had a polynomial form in terms of velocity (often approximated by the square of the velocity), continued to be used. Beyond the historical developments, Weisbach&#x27;s formula had the objective merit of adhering to dimensional analysis, resulting in a dimensionless friction factor f. The complexity of f, dependent on the mechanics of the boundary layer and the flow regime (laminar, transitional, or turbulent), tended to obscure its dependence on the quantities in Weisbach&#x27;s formula, leading many researchers to derive irrational and dimensionally inconsistent empirical formulas. It was understood not long after Weisbach&#x27;s work that the friction factor f depended on the flow regime and was independent of the Reynolds number (and thus the velocity) only in the case of rough pipes in a fully turbulent flow regime (Prandtl-von Kármán equation).

== Pressure-loss equation ==
In a cylindrical pipe of uniform diameter , flowing full, the pressure loss due to viscous effects is proportional to length and can be characterized by the Darcy–Weisbach equation:
:formula_10

The numbers 1.930 and 0.537 are phenomenological; these specific values provide a fairly good fit to the data. The product (called the &quot;friction Reynolds number&quot;) can be considered, like the Reynolds number, to be a (dimensionless) parameter of the flow: at fixed values of , the friction factor is also fixed.

In the Kármán–Prandtl resistance equation, can be expressed in closed form as an analytic function of through the use of the Lambert function:

: formula_11

In this flow regime, many small vortices are responsible for the transfer of momentum between the bulk of the fluid to the pipe wall. As the friction Reynolds number increases, the profile of the fluid velocity approaches the wall asymptotically, thereby transferring more momentum to the pipe wall, as modeled in Blasius boundary layer theory.

====Rough-pipe regime====

When the pipe surface&#x27;s roughness height is significant (typically at high Reynolds number), the friction factor departs from the smooth pipe curve, ultimately approaching an asymptotic value (&quot;rough pipe&quot; regime). In this regime, the resistance to flow varies according to the square of the mean flow velocity and is insensitive to Reynolds number. Here, it is useful to employ yet another dimensionless parameter of the flow, the &quot;roughness Reynolds number&quot;

: formula_12

where the roughness height is scaled to the pipe diameter .
It is illustrative to plot the roughness function :

: formula_13

Figure 3 shows versus for the rough pipe data of Nikuradse, Shockling, and Langelandsvik.

In this view, the data at different roughness ratio fall together when plotted against , demonstrating scaling in the variable . The following features are present:
* When , then is identically zero: flow is always in the smooth pipe regime. The data for these points lie to the left extreme of the abscissa and are not within the frame of the graph. 
* When , the data lie on the line ; flow is in the smooth pipe regime. 
* When , the data asymptotically approach a horizontal line; they are independent of , , and .
* The intermediate range of constitutes a transition from one behavior to the other. The data depart from the line very slowly, reach a maximum near , then fall to a constant value.

Afzal&#x27;s fit to these data in the transition from smooth pipe flow to rough pipe flow employs an exponential expression in that ensures proper behavior for (the transition from the smooth pipe regime to the rough pipe regime):

: formula_14

and 

: formula_15

This function shares the same values for its term in common with the Kármán–Prandtl resistance equation, plus one parameter 0.305 or 0.34 to fit the asymptotic behavior for along with one further parameter, 11, to govern the transition from smooth to rough flow. It is exhibited in Figure 3.

The friction factor for another analogous roughness becomes
 : formula_16

and

 : formula_17

This function shares the same values for its term in common with the Kármán–Prandtl resistance equation, plus one parameter 0.305 or 0.34 to fit the asymptotic behavior for along with one further parameter, 26, to govern the transition from smooth to rough flow. 
The Colebrook–White relation fits the friction factor with a function of the form

:formula_18} = -2.00 \log\left(2.51\frac{1}{\mathrm{Re} \sqrt{f_{\mathrm D}}} + \frac{1}{3.7}\frac{\varepsilon}{D}\right)&lt;/math&gt;}}

This relation has the correct behavior at extreme values of , as shown by the labeled curve in Figure 3: when is small, it is consistent with smooth pipe flow, when large, it is consistent with rough pipe flow. However its performance in the transitional domain overestimates the friction factor by a substantial margin. Colebrook acknowledges the discrepancy with Nikuradze&#x27;s data but argues that his relation is consistent with the measurements on commercial pipes. Indeed, such pipes are very different from those carefully prepared by Nikuradse: their surfaces are characterized by many different roughness heights and random spatial distribution of roughness points, while those of Nikuradse have surfaces with uniform roughness height, with the points extremely closely packed.

=== Calculating the friction factor from its parametrization ===
For turbulent flow, methods for finding the friction factor include using a diagram, such as the Moody chart, or solving equations such as the Colebrook–White equation (upon which the Moody chart is based), or the Swamee–Jain equation. While the Colebrook–White relation is, in the general case, an iterative method, the Swamee–Jain equation allows to be found directly for full flow in a circular pipe.

==== Direct calculation when friction loss &quot;&quot; is known ====
In typical engineering applications, there will be a set of given or known quantities. The acceleration of gravity and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid are known, as are the diameter of the pipe and its roughness height . If as well the head loss per unit length is a known quantity, then the friction factor can be calculated directly from the chosen fitting function. Solving the Darcy–Weisbach equation for ,

:formula_19

we can now express :

:formula_20

Expressing the roughness Reynolds number ,

:formula_21

we have the two parameters needed to substitute into the Colebrook–White relation, or any other function, for the friction factor , the flow velocity , and the volumetric flow rate .

=== Confusion with the Fanning friction factor ===
The Darcy–Weisbach friction factor is 4 times larger than the Fanning friction factor , so attention must be paid to note which one of these is meant in any &quot;friction factor&quot; chart or equation being used. Of the two, the Darcy–Weisbach factor is more commonly used by civil and mechanical engineers, and the Fanning factor by chemical engineers, but care should be taken to identify the correct factor regardless of the source of the chart or formula.

Note that

: formula_22

Most charts or tables indicate the type of friction factor, or at least provide the formula for the friction factor with laminar flow. If the formula for laminar flow is , it is the Fanning factor , and if the formula for laminar flow is , it is the Darcy–Weisbach factor .

Which friction factor is plotted in a Moody diagram may be determined by inspection if the publisher did not include the formula described above:
#Observe the value of the friction factor for laminar flow at a Reynolds number of 1000.
#If the value of the friction factor is 0.064, then the Darcy friction factor is plotted in the Moody diagram. Note that the nonzero digits in 0.064 are the numerator in the formula for the laminar Darcy friction factor: .
#If the value of the friction factor is 0.016, then the Fanning friction factor is plotted in the Moody diagram. Note that the nonzero digits in 0.016 are the numerator in the formula for the laminar Fanning friction factor: .

The procedure above is similar for any available Reynolds number that is an integer power of ten. It is not necessary to remember the value 1000 for this procedure—only that an integer power of ten is of interest for this purpose.

== History ==
Historically this equation arose as a variant on the Prony equation; this variant was developed by Henry Darcy of France, and further refined into the form used today by Julius Weisbach of Saxony in 1845. Initially, data on the variation of with velocity was lacking, so the Darcy–Weisbach equation was outperformed at first by the empirical Prony equation in many cases. In later years it was eschewed in many special-case situations in favor of a variety of empirical equations valid only for certain flow regimes, notably the Hazen–Williams equation or the Manning equation, most of which were significantly easier to use in calculations. However, since the advent of the calculator, ease of calculation is no longer a major issue, and so the Darcy–Weisbach equation&#x27;s generality has made it the preferred one.

== Derivation by dimensional analysis ==
Away from the ends of the pipe, the characteristics of the flow are independent of the position along the pipe. The key quantities are then the pressure drop along the pipe per unit length, , and the volumetric flow rate. The flow rate can be converted to a mean flow velocity by dividing by the wetted area of the flow (which equals the cross-sectional area of the pipe if the pipe is full of fluid).

Pressure has dimensions of energy per unit volume, therefore the pressure drop between two points must be proportional to the dynamic pressure q. We also know that pressure must be proportional to the length of the pipe between the two points as the pressure drop per unit length is a constant. To turn the relationship into a proportionality coefficient of dimensionless quantity, we can divide by the hydraulic diameter of the pipe, , which is also constant along the pipe. Therefore,

:formula_23

The proportionality coefficient is the dimensionless &quot;Darcy friction factor&quot; or &quot;flow coefficient&quot;. This dimensionless coefficient will be a combination of geometric factors such as , the Reynolds number and (outside the laminar regime) the relative roughness of the pipe (the ratio of the roughness height to the hydraulic diameter).

Note that the dynamic pressure is not the kinetic energy of the fluid per unit volume, for the following reasons. Even in the case of laminar flow, where all the flow lines are parallel to the length of the pipe, the velocity of the fluid on the inner surface of the pipe is zero due to viscosity, and the velocity in the center of the pipe must therefore be larger than the average velocity obtained by dividing the volumetric flow rate by the wet area. The average kinetic energy then involves the root mean-square velocity, which always exceeds the mean velocity. In the case of turbulent flow, the fluid acquires random velocity components in all directions, including perpendicular to the length of the pipe, and thus turbulence contributes to the kinetic energy per unit volume but not to the average lengthwise velocity of the fluid.

==Practical application==
In a hydraulic engineering application, it is typical for the volumetric flow within a pipe (that is, its productivity) and the head loss per unit length (the concomitant power consumption) to be the critical important factors. The practical consequence is that, for a fixed volumetric flow rate , head loss &quot;decreases&quot; with the inverse fifth power of the pipe diameter, . Doubling the diameter of a pipe of a given schedule (say, ANSI schedule 40) roughly doubles the amount of material required per unit length and thus its installed cost. Meanwhile, the head loss is decreased by a factor of 32 (about a 97% reduction). Thus the energy consumed in moving a given volumetric flow of the fluid is cut down dramatically for a modest increase in capital cost.

== Advantages ==
The Darcy-Weisbach&#x27;s accuracy and universal applicability makes it the ideal formula for flow in pipes. The advantages of the equation are as follows:

* It is based on fundamentals.
* It is dimensionally consistent.
* It is useful for any fluid, including oil, gas, brine, and sludges.
* It can be derived analytically in the laminar flow region.
* It is useful in the transition region between laminar flow and fully developed turbulent flow.
* The friction factor variation is well documented.

Tommaso di Cristoforo Fini ( – ), known by his nickname Masolino da Panicale (), was an Italian painter. His best known works are probably his collaborations with Masaccio: &quot;Madonna with Child and St. Anne&quot; (1424) and the frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel (1424–1428).

==Biography==
Masolino was possibly born in Panicale, present-day Umbria. He may have been an assistant to Ghiberti in Florence between 1403 and 1407. In 1423, he joined the Florentine guild &quot;Arte dei Medici e Speziali&quot; (Doctors and Apothecaries), which included painters as an independent branch. He may have been the first artist to create oil paintings in the 1420s, rather than Jan van Eyck in the 1430s, as was previously supposed. He spent many years traveling, including a trip to Hungary from September 1425 to July 1427 under the patronage of Pipo of Ozora, a mercenary captain. He was selected by Pope Martin V (Oddone Colonna) on the return of the papacy to Rome in 1420 to paint the altarpiece for his family chapel in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, and later by Cardinal Branda da Castiglione to paint the Saint Catherine Chapel in the Basilica of San Clemente, Rome. In the interim, he collaborated with his younger colleague, Masaccio, to paint the frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel in the Basilica of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, which were much admired by fellow artists throughout the fifteenth century. He painted a cycle of 300 famous historical figures in the Orsini Palace in Rome about 1433–34 and also worked in Todi. He spent his later years, after 1435, working for Cardinal Branda Castiglione in Castiglione Olona.

==Early use of the central vanishing point==
Masolino was probably the first painter to make use of a central vanishing point in his 1423 painting &quot;St. Peter Healing a Cripple and the Raising of Tabitha&quot;.

==St Catherine Refusing to Worship Idols==
&quot;The lunette of the left-hand wall, depicting St Catherine Refusing to Worship Idols. In an elaborate temple setting, Catherine is pointing toward heaven, while the emperor, here bareheaded, gazes up at the idolatrous statue atop the altar. His retainers are crowded behind them, one of them, only partially visible, is sounding a trumpet.&quot;

Big Rapids Industrial School, as it was originally named, opened on September 1, 1884, in temporary quarters in the Vandersluis Block (present location of J.C. Penney Co.) in Big Rapids. The goal of the school was to provide students with marketable skills for a changing society. By the beginning of the next semester in January 1885, the school changed its name to Ferris Industrial School. In January 1894, the school moved into and dedicated its new building, Old Main, on the corner of Oak and Ives Streets. At this same time, the school was incorporated with capital stock of $50,000.

In 1898, the institution was again renamed to Ferris Institute. In 1900, W. N. Ferris sold capital stock in Ferris Institute to the public, keeping a controlling interest in his own hands. It remained privately owned until August 25, 1931, when the Board of Incorporators, a group of 39 businessmen, purchased Ferris Institute from the old stockholders and selected a board of trustees from their number to govern the school.

In February 1943, alumnus Colin Smith introduced a bill in the legislature for the state to purchase Ferris Institute. It passed both houses, but was vetoed by Governor Harry Kelly. On May 17, 1949, Governor G. Mennen Williams signed the bill accepting Ferris Institute as a gift to the state of Michigan, which took over its governance on July 1, 1950. Before the state took control, though, fire destroyed the Old Main and the Old Pharmacy buildings on February 21, 1950. Only the Alumni Building and some minor buildings were left standing. Immediate rebuilding of the institute began, and on July 1, 1963, it was again renamed, this time as Ferris State College.

In November 1987, the institution became Ferris State University. When Ferris became a state college in the fall of 1950, it had consisted entirely of one permanent structure, the Alumni Building, and some surplus Army barracks. At that time, fewer than 1,000 students were enrolled, with fewer than 50 faculty members, and the campus itself covered less than . By contrast, current enrollment is more than 10,000, and the campus contains 115 buildings, including educational, administrative, maintenance, student-activity, and residence-hall facilities.

==Academics==
The university has eight colleges offering more than 170 educational programs—Arts and Sciences, Business, Education and Human Services, Engineering Technology, Health Professions, the Kendall College of Art and Design, Michigan College of Optometry, and Pharmacy.

<text>Orvieto () is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the Province of Terni, southwestern Umbria, Italy, situated on the flat summit of a large butte of volcanic tuff. The city rises dramatically above the almost-vertical faces of tuff cliffs that are completed by defensive walls built of the same stone.

==History==
===Etruscan era===
The ancient city (&quot;urbs vetus&quot; in Latin, whence &quot;Orvieto&quot;), populated since Etruscan times, has usually been associated with Etruscan Velzna, but some modern scholars differ. Orvieto was certainly a major centre of Etruscan civilization; the archaeological museum (Museo Claudio Faina e Museo Civico) houses some of the Etruscan artifacts that have been recovered in the immediate area. A tomb in the Orvieto Cannicella necropolis bears the inscription &quot;mi aviles katacinas&quot;, &quot;I am of Avile Katacina&quot;; the tomb&#x27;s occupant thus bore an Etruscan-Latin first name, Aulus, and a family name that is believed to be of Celtic origin (derived from &quot;Catacos&quot;). This interesting artifact might show the complexity of ethnic relations in ancient Italy, and how such relations could be peaceful. 

Also in the area is the Golini Tomb, which was constructed in the fourth century BCE. Its wall paintings depict a funeral banquet, giving some insight into the real-life gatherings held after the deaths of aristocratic Etruscans. The pictures include scenes of servants preparing for the feast in various ways.

===Roman and post-Roman antiquity===
Orvieto was annexed by Rome in the third century BC. Because of its site on a high, steep bluff of tuff, a volcanic rock, the city was virtually impregnable. After the collapse of the Roman Empire its defensible site gained new importance: the episcopal seat was transferred from Bolsena, and the city was held by Goths and by Lombards before its self-governing commune was established in the tenth century, in which consuls governed under a feudal oath of fealty to the bishop. Orvieto&#x27;s relationship to the papacy has been a close one; in the tenth century Pope Benedict VII visited the city of Orvieto with his nephew, Filippo Alberici, who later settled there and became Consul of the city-state in 1016. By the thirteenth century, three papal palaces had been built.

===Middle Ages===
Orvieto, sitting on its impregnable rock controlling the road between Florence and Rome where it crossed the Chiana, was a large town: its population numbered about 30,000 at the end of the 13th century. Its municipal institutions already recognized in a papal bull of 1157, from 1201 Orvieto governed itself through a podestà, who was as often as not the bishop, however, acting in concert with a military governor, the &quot;captain of the people&quot;. The city was divided into four rione or districts: Serancia, San Giovenale, Postierla, and Santa pace. In the 13th century bitter feuds divided the city, which was at the apogée of its wealth but found itself often at odds with the papacy, even under interdict. Pope Urban IV stayed at Orvieto from 1262 to 1264.

The city became one of the major cultural centers of its time when Thomas Aquinas taught at the &quot;studium&quot; there. A small university (now part of the University of Perugia), had its origins in a &quot;studium generale&quot; that was granted to the city by Pope Gregory IX in 1236. After teaching in Orvieto, Aquinas was called to Rome in 1265 to serve as papal theologian to the newly elected Pope Clement IV, and as Regent master of the Santa Sabina &quot;studium provinciale&quot;, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;.

===Papal rule===
The territory of Orvieto was under papal control long before it was officially added to the Papal States (various dates are quoted). It remained a papal possession until 1860, when it was annexed to a unified Italy.

==Main sights==

===The Duomo===

On 15 November 1290, Pope Nicholas IV laid the cornerstone for the present building and dedicated it to the Assumption of the Virgin, a feast for which the city had a long history of special devotion. The design has often been attributed to Arnolfo di Cambio, but the prevailing modern opinion is that the master mason was an obscure monk named Fra&#x27; Bevignate from Perugia. The church is striped in white travertine and greenish-black basalt in narrow bands, similar in many ways to the cathedral of Siena and other central Italian cathedrals of that era. In the following decade, cathedral authorities called Sienese architect and sculptor Lorenzo Maitani to stabilize the building and design a façade. He enlarged the choir and planned a transept with two chapels (c. 1308–1330), spaces that were not finished until long after his death. The cathedral has five bells, tuned in E flat, which date back to the renaissance.

The façade (&quot;illustration above&quot;) is particularly striking and includes some remarkable sculpture by Lorenzo Maitani (14th century). Inside the cathedral, the Chapel of San Brizio is frescoed by Fra Angelico and with Luca Signorelli&#x27;s masterpiece, his &quot;Last Judgment&quot; (1449–1451). The Corporal of Bolsena, on view in the Duomo, dates from a eucharistic miracle in Bolsena in 1263, when a consecrated host began to bleed onto a corporal, the small cloth upon which the host and chalice rest during the canon of the Mass.

===Orvieto Città del Corpus Domini and Papal residence===

From the 11th century onward, the popes maintained political presence in the papal territory which occupied central Italy. Together with his court, the pope moved from palace to palace in the manner of his European secular counterparts. Several central Italian cities hosted the pope and his retinue during the years of wandering, housing them in the bishop&#x27;s palace. Outside Rome, only Orvieto and Viterbo (and eventually Avignon) had papal palaces. Pope Adrian IV (1154–59) was the first pope to spend significant time in Orvieto. His successor, Pope Innocent III (1198–1216), was a militant opponent of the Cathar heresy, which had infiltrated the city, and took measures to eradicate that heresy. In 1227, Pope Gregory IX confirmed the Dominican &quot;studium generale&quot; in Orvieto, a school of theology, and one of the first in Europe. Pope Urban IV (1261–1264), a Frenchman who was crowned in the Dominican church in Viterbo and who spent most of his papacy in Orvieto, also left important legacies in the city. In 1263, he began a papal palace, perhaps the first outside Rome, and consecrated the new Dominican church in Orvieto. The Pope Nicholas IV (1288–92) chose Orvieto over his hometown of Rome as seat of the Curia in 1291–92, establishing the meeting of the Curia in Orvieto as a tradition. He was rewarded by the Orvietans by being elected Podestà and Capitano del Popolo, the first pope to hold civic offices in the city.

His successor Pope Boniface VIII (1294–1303) continued the papal tie to Orvieto. Although often criticized by historians for nepotism and greed, the Orvietans were recipients of the pope&#x27;s generosity, and honored Boniface by electing him city Capitano and Podestà in 1297 and Capitano again in 1298. He built the third and final papal palace, the Palazzo Soliano. He also donated statues of himself at the main city gates, which earned him some criticism from his many enemies. Benedict XI (1288–1305) was the last pope to live in Italy before the Avignon papacy. During the years from Nicholas IV until Benedict XI Orvieto hosted the pope more frequently than Rome, and discussions continued as to whether or not Rome should remain the papal city. Urban IV with the Bolla Transiturus established and promulgated in 1264 from Orvieto to the Christian universe the solemnity of Corpus Domini which the entire Catholic world celebrates. Supporting pillars of the institution of the universal Christian Eucharistic solemnity were Saints Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure of Bagnoregio, who together with Hugues de St-Cher were readers in the Studium Curiae of Orvieto. Pope Nicholas V (1447–55) gave support to the city. In a letter of 1449, the pope gave money for the restoration of the episcopal palace that originally had been a project of Nicholas IV. He also allowed Fra Angelico to begin painting in the Cappella Nuova of the cathedral.

During the sack of Rome in 1527 by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Pope Clement VII took refuge at Orvieto. Fearing that in the event of siege by Charles&#x27;s troops the city&#x27;s water might prove insufficient, he commissioned a spectacular 62 meter deep well, the &quot;Pozzo di San Patrizio&quot; or &quot;Well of St. Patrick&quot;. This Italian name, inspired by medieval legends that St. Patrick&#x27;s Purgatory in Ireland gave access down to Purgatory, was used to indicate something very deep. The construction was by the architect-engineer Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. The central well shaft was surrounded by ramps in a double helix, similar to Saladin&#x27;s Well. These ramps were each designed for one-way traffic, so that mules laden with water-jars might pass down and then up unobstructed. An inscription on the well boasts that (&quot;what nature stinted for provision, application has supplied&quot;).

===Underground tunneling system===
The city of Orvieto has long kept the secret of its labyrinth of caves and tunnels that lie beneath the surface. Dug deep into the tuff, a volcanic rock, these secret hidden tunnels are now open to view only through guided tours. Their spectacular nature has also yielded many historical and archeological finds. Saint Anselm College has set up a program where each summer, students travel to Italy to work at the college&#x27;s archaeology site located at the Coriglia excavation site, just outside town.

The underground city boasts more than 1200 tunnels, galleries, wells, stairs, quarries, cellars, unexpected passageways, cisterns, superimposed rooms with numerous small square niches for pigeon roosts, detailing its creation over the centuries. Many of the homes of noble families were equipped with a means of escape from the elevated city during times of siege through secret escape tunnels carved from the soft rock. The tunnels would lead from the city palazzo to emerge at a safe exit point some distance away from city walls.
===The Albornoz fortress===

In Piazza Cahen stands the Fortezza dell&#x27;Albornoz. It was built by order of the Spanish Cardinal Albornoz under orders from Pope Innocent VI and designed by condottiero and military engineer Ugolino di Montemarte. The Albornoz fortress stands on an area that was once occupied by a temple known by the Latin name &quot;Augurale&quot;.

Originally known as the Rocca di San Martino, construction on this massive fortress started either in 1359 or 1353 near the town&#x27;s cemetery. Its aim was to provide the church a secure site in the city and allow the cardinal and his captains to consolidate recent military victories.

In its original square plan the fortress was flanked by a small building near the main entrance and surrounded by a moat, crossed by a drawbridge. However, the Rocca was almost completely razed to the ground in 1395 and successive attempts to rebuild it were unsuccessful. The fortress was finally rebuilt during the mid-15th century, using original plans and an additional circular line of fortifications.

After the sack of Rome at the end of 1527 Pope Clement VII took refuge in Orvieto. To ensure that the city would be sufficiently supplied with water in the event of a siege, he gave orders for the digging of the now famous artesian well Pozzo di San Patrizio (1528–1537). For added security, the pope ordered that a second well be dug to supply the fortress alone.

<doc id="221677" wikidata="Q1202041" url="?curid=221677" title="Triple Crown (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, a player earns a Triple Crown when he leads a league in three specific statistical categories in the same season. The term &quot;Triple Crown&quot; generally refers to the batting achievement of leading a league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) over the same season. The term &quot;Pitching Triple Crown&quot; refers to the pitching achievement of leading a league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).

The term &quot;Triple Crown&quot; is typically used when a player leads one league, such as the American League (AL) or the National League (NL), in the specified categories. A tie for a lead in any category, such as home runs, is sufficient to be considered the leader in that category. A &quot;Major League Triple Crown&quot; may be said to occur when a player leads all of Major League Baseball in all three categories.

==Hitting Triple Crown==

The term &quot;Triple Crown&quot; generally refers to the hitting achievement. A hitter who completes a season leading a league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) may be said to have won the &quot;Triple Crown.&quot; The term, unless modified, connotes the batting achievement; it is not necessary to refer to it as the &quot;hitting&quot; Triple Crown.

The Triple Crown reflects the ability of a hitter to excel in three important ways: to hit safely a high percentage of the time (batting average); to hit the ball long distances (home runs); and to produce when runners are on base, driving them home to score (RBI). It is an uncommon feat to lead all hitters in each of these categories. It has been accomplished 17 times in a major league season, most recently in 2012, by Miguel Cabrera. Cabrera&#x27;s was the first since 1967, when Carl Yastrzemski accomplished the feat. Yastrzemski won the Triple Crown the year after Frank Robinson did, the only time back-to-back Triple Crowns occurred in baseball history.

Hiromitsu Ochiai and Oscar Charleston are the only players to have won three batting Triple Crowns in any league. Ochiai won in 1982, 1985, and 1986 while competing in the Pacific League of Nippon Professional Baseball. Charleston won in 1921 while playing in the Negro National League, and again in 1924 and 1925 while playing in the Eastern Colored League. In the American League and National League, the most batting Triple Crowns won by a player is two. Rogers Hornsby was the first to accomplish it, winning his first in 1922 and then leading both leagues in 1925 en route to his second Triple Crown, both with the St. Louis Cardinals. Ted Williams later matched this mark, leading both leagues in 1942 and the American League in 1947, both with the Boston Red Sox.

The Cardinals have won the most hitting Triple Crowns as a franchise with four. Along with Hornsby&#x27;s two, Tip O&#x27;Neill won in the now-defunct American Association in 1887 while the team was known as the St. Louis Browns, and Joe Medwick added the Cardinals&#x27; fourth in 1937. Eleven of the thirteen eligible players who have batting Triple Crowns have been elected to the Hall of Fame. Baseball journalist Tim Kurkjian believes the Triple Crown has become more difficult to win with the advent of more hitters who choose to specialize in either hitting for batting average or power.

==Pitching Triple Crown==

A pitcher who leads the league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA) is said to have won the &quot;Pitching Triple Crown.&quot; The term was previously defined as leading the league in wins, ERA, and winning percentage. It was used in that older sense to describe the unsuccessful pursuits of that goal by Bobby Shantz in 1952 and Johnny Antonelli in 1954 as well as Sandy Koufax in 1963. Koufax was first described as having won the Pitching Triple Crown in the current sense after his 1965 season, though the older sense continued to be used.

In contrast to the respective batting statistics, the Pitching Triple Crown statistics are more or less complementary (for example, a pitcher who is especially proficient at striking out batters is likely to give up fewer earned runs, and consequently more likely to win games); therefore, the accomplishment is not as rare as the batting crown.

The Pitching Triple Crown has been accomplished 39 times in the American and National Leagues. The most by one player is three, accomplished by three players. Grover Cleveland Alexander captured his first two in consecutive seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies (1915–1916), and won a third in 1920 with the Chicago Cubs. Alexander is the only pitcher to win a Pitching Triple Crown with more than one major league team. Walter Johnson won his three Triple Crowns with the original Washington Senators, leading the league in all three categories in 1913, 1918, and 1924. Sandy Koufax was the most recent to capture three Triple Crowns, winning his three within four seasons for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1963, 1965–1966); all of Koufax&#x27;s crowns led both major leagues, the most for any player.

Outside MLB, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Sun Dong-yol each won three pitching triple crowns and are the only players to achievement in three consecutive seasons. Yamamoto achieved this record in the NPB from 2021 to 2023, and Sun Dong-yol achieved it in the KBO League from 1989 to 1991.

Other major league pitchers who have won multiple Pitching Triple Crowns include Christy Mathewson (1905 and 1908 New York Giants), Lefty Grove (1930 and 1931 Philadelphia Athletics), Lefty Gomez (1934 and 1937 New York Yankees), and Roger Clemens (1997 and 1998 Toronto Blue Jays).

One pitcher, Guy Hecker, won a Triple Crown in a defunct 19th century major league; he led the original American Association in wins, strikeouts, and ERA in 1884 while pitching for the Louisville Colonels.

Eighteen of 24 major league pitchers who have won a Triple Crown and are eligible for the Hall of Fame have been inducted. The Triple Crown winners who most recently became eligible for the Hall are Pedro Martínez and Randy Johnson. Both were elected to the Hall of Fame in 2015, each in their first year of eligibility.

The most recent major league pitchers to achieve the feat are Chris Sale and Tarik Skubal in 2024. As of 2024, every MLB pitcher who has achieved the Triple Crown has concurrently won the Cy Young Award for that season.

==Major league records==
The first major league pitcher to achieve the pitching Triple Crown was Tommy Bond, in the NL in 1877. The following year, Paul Hines became the first major leaguer to lead the NL in the three batting categories; he, Heinie Zimmerman, and Miguel Cabrera are the only three players to be AL or NL Triple Crown winners and not reach the Hall of Fame, although Cabrera will not be eligible for induction until 2029. The highest home run total reached by a Crown winner was Mickey Mantle, with 52 in 1956. The highest RBI total belongs to Lou Gehrig, with 165 in 1934. Rogers Hornsby has the highest home run total by an NL winner, 42, from his 1922 season. The NL high for RBI is 154, set by Joe Medwick in 1937. Hugh Duffy&#x27;s .440 average in his 1894 Triple Crown season is the highest batting average by any player in major league history. Nap Lajoie, in 1901, set the all-time AL single-season high in batting average with .426.

Among the major leaguers who earned the pitching Triple Crown, the lowest ERAs belong to Walter Johnson (1.14 in 1913 AL) and Grover Alexander (1.22 in 1915 NL). The highest win total belongs to Charles Radbourn, amassed in 1884, who in that year set a major league single-season record with at least 59 wins. Radbourn struck out 441 batters that season, the highest total for a Triple Crown winner. Walter Johnson holds the highest win total by an AL pitching Triple Crown winner, with 36 in 1913. Among AL pitching Triple Crown winners, Pedro Martínez registered the highest season strikeout total, with 313 in 1999. Since 1901, the major league pitcher with the highest season strikeout total in the course of a Triple Crown season is Sandy Koufax, striking out 382 in 1965.

====Batting====
Research in 2015 restored the Chicago Cubs&#x27; Heinie Zimmerman of 1912 to the list. There is doubt over whether Hugh Duffy&#x27;s 1894 RBI totals were the highest. 

====Pitching====



===Negro league baseball===
On December 16, 2020, Major League Baseball announced that the records of Negro league baseball from 1920 to 1948 would be designated as major league status. As such, seven different leagues that existed in that time period are now recognized as being on the same level as MLB. Seven batters and four pitchers achieved the Triple Crown in that era.

Since the KBO League&#x27;s strikeout titles began to be officially awarded in the 1993 season, the criteria for KBO League pitchers Triple Crown until 1992 are wins, ERA, and a pitcher&#x27;s winning percentage.

===== The Standard of 1982–1992 =====
===== The Standard of 1993– =====
Sun Dong-yol won the MVP of the season in 1986 with getting annual wins, strikeout, and ERA title. But as mentioned above, The KBO League&#x27;s pitcher triple crown standard at that time was a winning-rate title, not a strikeout, so it is officially considered that Sun Dong-yeol in 1986 did not achieve the triple crown. Sun Dong-yol&#x27;s winning percentage in the 1986 season was .800, ranking 2nd in the league.

<text>Star Pointer (1889–1910) was the first Standardbred race horse to complete a mile in less than two minutes. He was a pacer by Brown Hal out of Sweepstakes.

Star Pointer was bred by Captain Henry P. Pointer of Spring Hill, Tennessee. His sire was Brown Hal and his dam was Sweepstakes. He began racing in 1894.

On August 28, 1897, driven by David J. McClary, he broke the 2 minute mile barrier at around 4:00 pm with quarter times of 30 sec, 29, 29, 30 for a 1:59 time. His record stood until 1903, when it was beaten to 1:59 by Dan Patch.

David J. McClary
Hall of Fame Inductee, 2002
The first person to drive a standardbred horse to win at a mile in less than two minutes was David J. McClary, a native of London, Ont. He achieved the feat on Aug. 28, 1897, when he drove pacer Star Pointer to an epic 1:59 1/4 at Readville, Mass. Star Pointer, owned by James Murphy of Chicago, had been a big, clumsy-gaited, knee-knocking pacer, particularly when going slow. But under McClary&#x27;s careful tutelage Star Pointer in full flight traveled faster than any horse of his time. His record stood until 1903, when it was lowered to 1:59 by the legendary Dan Patch.

McClary was enjoying unsurpassed success among trainers of that era. Three days previous to the epochal mile by Star Pointer, he won a bitterly fought six-heat race with Guinette (2:02 1/4) at the Readville track. He retired from the sulky in 1915 and lived in Connecticut until his death in 1940. He was elected an Immortal to harness racing&#x27;s Hall of Fame at Goshen, N.Y., in 1959.

On November 22, 1898, Star Pointer was sold in Madison Square Garden New York City for $15,000 to ex congressman White of Cleveland Ohio. James A Murphy wept upon the sale and loss of his beloved horse.

Star Pointer died of a stroke several weeks before the Christmas of 1910. His record was 22 victories and 4 seconds in 30 starts. He had a total of 60 wins in 79 heats and earnings of over $50,000 (). His remains were buried beneath the finish line of the Dean Racetrack in Palatine, Illinois but the exact location is now lost to history. He was inducted into the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1954.

Star Pointer was owned by James A. Murphy,(born in Rome New York August 11, 1846 and died January 24, 1920, in New York City)and was a resident of Chicago Illinois. He was famous throughout the United States as a thorough horseman and was a familiar figure on the tracks of the big meets. James A. Murphy organized the Central Grange and Stock Exchange.

<text>Victory Song (1944–1963) was a trotting horse who was bought as a yearling by Castleton Farm of Lexington, Kentucky. In 1947, he became the first Standardbred to be elected United States Harness Horse of the Year. In that year he ran the fastest mile in either standardbred gait setting a new race record of 1:57.3 for trotting the mile.

Retired to stud, Victory Song was an immediate success siring two world champions from his first crop of foals in 1950. Victory Song died in 1963.

He was buried at the Castleton Farm horse cemetery.

In 1966 he was elected to the Harness Racing Hall of Fame.

<doc id="221684" wikidata="Q2044323" url="?curid=221684" title="Law French">
<text>Law French () is an archaic language originally based on Anglo-Norman, but increasingly influenced by Parisian French and, later, English. It was used in the law courts of England from the 13th century. Its use continued for several centuries in the courts of England and Wales and Ireland. Although Law French as a narrative legal language is obsolete, many individual Law French terms continue to be used by lawyers and judges in common law jurisdictions.

==History==
The earliest known documents in which &#x27;French&#x27;, i.e. Anglo-Norman, is used for discourse on English law date from the third quarter of the thirteenth century, and include two particular documents. The first is the 1258 &quot;Provisions of Oxford&quot;, consisting of the terms of oaths sworn by the 24 magnates appointed to rectify abuses in the rule of King Henry III, together with summaries of their rulings. The second is the &quot;Casus Placitorum&quot; (), a collection of legal maxims, rules and brief narratives of cases.

In these works the language is already sophisticated and technical, well equipped with its own legal terminology. This includes many words which are of Latin origin, but whose forms have been shortened or distorted in a way which suggests a long history of French usage. Some examples include &quot;advowson&quot; from the Latin , meaning the legal right to nominate a parish priest; &quot;neif[e]&quot;, from the Latin , meaning a female serf, and &quot;essoyne&quot; or &quot;essone&quot; from the Latin , meaning a circumstance that exempts one from a royal summons. Later &quot;&quot; replaced in Latin, thus replacing the Latin from with the French one.

Until the early fourteenth century, Law French largely coincided with the French used as an everyday language by the upper classes. As such, it reflected some of the changes that northern dialects of mainland French had undergone. Hence, in the documents mentioned above, &#x27;of the king&#x27; is rendered as &quot;del rey&quot;, or &quot;del roy&quot;, whereas by about 1330 it had become , as in modern French, or &quot;du roy&quot;.

During the 14th century, vernacular French suffered a rapid decline. The use of Law French was criticized by those who argued that lawyers sought to restrict entry into the legal profession. The Pleading in English Act 1362 (&quot;Statute of Pleading&quot;) acknowledged this change by ordaining that thenceforward all court pleading must be in English, so &quot;every Man ... may the better govern himself without offending of the Law&quot;. From that time, Law French lost much of its status as a spoken language. 

Law French remained in use for the &#x27;readings&#x27; (lectures) and &#x27;moots&#x27; (academic debates), held in the Inns of Court as part of the education of young lawyers, but it rapidly became only a written language. It ceased to acquire new words and its grammar broke down. By about 1500, gender was often neglected, giving rise to &quot;une home&quot; (&#x27;a (feminine) man&#x27;) or &quot;un feme&quot; (&#x27;a (masculine) woman&#x27;). More and more of its vocabulary became English, as it was only used by English, Welsh and Irish lawyers and judges who often spoke no real French.

In the seventeenth century, the moots and readings fell into neglect, and the rule of Oliver Cromwell, with its emphasis on removing the relics of archaic ritual from legal and governmental processes, struck a further blow to the language. Even before then, in 1628, Sir Edward Coke acknowledged in his preface to the &quot;First Part of the Institutes of the Law of England&quot;, that Law French had almost ceased to be a spoken tongue. It was still used for case reports and legal textbooks until almost the end of 1600s, but only in an anglicized form. A frequently quoted example of this change comes from one of Chief Justice Sir George Treby&#x27;s marginal notes in an annotated edition of &quot;Dyer&#x27;s Reports&quot;, published 1688:

The Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act 1730 made English, instead of Law French and Latin, the obligatory language for use in the courts of England and in the court of exchequer in Scotland. It was later extended to Wales, and seven years later a similar act was passed in Ireland, the Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737.

==Survivals in modern legal terminology==
The postpositive adjectives in many legal noun phrases in English—&quot;attorney general, fee simple&quot;—are a heritage from Law French. Native speakers of French may not understand certain Law French terms not used in modern French or replaced by other terms. For example, the current French word for &quot;mortgage&quot; is . Many of the terms of Law French were converted into modern English in the 20th century to make the law more understandable in common-law jurisdictions. Some key Law French terms remain, including the following:

<text>James McCauley Landis (September 25, 1899 – July 30, 1964) was an American government official and legal adviser. He served as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1935 to 1937.

==Biography==
Landis was born in Tokyo, Japan, where his parents were teachers at a missionary school. After completing his studies at Mercersburg Academy in 1916, he graduated from Princeton University and in 1924 received a LL.B. from Harvard Law School, where he was a student of Felix Frankfurter. In 1925, Landis was a law clerk to Justice Louis Brandeis of the U.S. Supreme Court. He then became a professor at Harvard Law School, until called into government service during the New Deal.

Landis served as a member of the Federal Trade Commission (1933–1934), as a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission (1934–1937), and as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (1935–1937). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1938 and the American Philosophical Society in 1942. While dean of the Harvard Law School from 1937 to 1946, Landis served as regional director of the U.S. Office of Civilian Defense (1941–1942) and then as its national director (1942–1943). He was removed from his position of dean following an affair he had with a secretary. President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent him to Egypt as American Director of Economic Operations in the Middle East (1943–1945). In 1946, Roosevelt&#x27;s successor, Harry S. Truman, later appointed him chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, a position he served until the next year. A friend of the Kennedy family for years, he served as a legal advisor to Joseph P. Kennedy and as Special Counsel to President John F. Kennedy. In 1960 he drafted the Landis Report to President-elect Kennedy, reexamining the federal regulatory commissions and recommending such reforms as strengthening the commissions&#x27; chairmen and streamlining their procedures, which the Kennedy administration adopted.

Landis failed to pay his income taxes from 1956 to 1960. After this came to light in 1963, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one month in jail. Because of illness, he spent the month in hospital facilities. Less than a year after he returned home, he suffered a heart attack and drowned in his swimming pool.

<doc id="221689" wikidata="Q170102" url="?curid=221689" title="Scrapie">
<text>Scrapie () is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the nervous systems of sheep and goats. It is one of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), and as such it is thought to be caused by a prion. Scrapie has been known since at least 1732 and does not appear to be transmissible to humans. However, it has been found to be experimentally transmissible to humanised transgenic mice and non-human primates.

The name scrapie is derived from one of the clinical signs of the condition, wherein affected animals will compulsively scrape off their fleeces against rocks, trees or fences. The disease apparently causes an itching sensation in the animals. Other clinical signs include excessive lip smacking, altered gaits and convulsive collapse.

Scrapie is infectious and transmissible among conspecifics, so one of the most common ways to contain it (since it is incurable) is to quarantine and kill those affected. However, scrapie tends to persist in flocks and can also arise spontaneously in flocks that have not previously had cases of the disease. The mechanism of transmission between animals and other aspects of the biology of the disease are only poorly understood, and are active areas of research. Recent studies suggest prions may be spread through urine and persist in the environment for decades.

Scrapie usually affects sheep around three to five years of age. The potential for transmission at birth and from contact with placental tissues is apparent.

==Regulation==

The disease has been notifiable in the EU since 1993, but unlike bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease), there was no evidence as of 1999 to suggest that scrapie is a risk to human health. In July 2003, a Canadian Food Inspection Agency officer said that while scrapie shows up every year on Canadian farms, &quot;We&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with scrapie and there&#x27;s never been a link between scrapie and human illness.&quot; As of 2004, the USDA made no mention of scrapie in its &quot;Sheep and Goats Death Loss&quot; circular.

Historically, scrapie was considered to be an animal health issue. However, between 1996 and 1999, the UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee considered the control and eradication of scrapie in the UK also with public health in mind because of concern over five issues:
* Meat and bone meal (MBM), which was suspected to be the source of the BSE in cattle outbreak in the late 1990s, had also been fed to sheep and goats.
* BSE had been transmitted to sheep following experimental oral exposure.
* Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) infection was widespread through the carcasses of the sheep, unlike cattle infection which is limited to neural tissues.
* Scrapie in sheep was underreported and it might be masking BSE, were it present in sheep.
* Specified risk material (SRM) measures may not be adequate to control human exposure.

==Cause==
Scrapie and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are caused by prions. Prions were determined to be the infectious agent because transmission is difficult to prevent with heat, radiation and disinfectants, the agent does not evoke any detectable immune response, and it has a long incubation period of between 18 months and 5 years. The agent is thought to be much smaller than the smallest known virus. Prions multiply by causing normally folded proteins of the same type to take on their abnormal shape, which then go on to do the same, in a kind of chain reaction. These abnormal proteins are gradually accumulated in the body, especially in nerve cells, which subsequently die.

==Transmission and pathogenesis==
The primary mode of transmission is from mother to lamb through ingestion of placental or allantoic fluids.
The agent can also enter through cuts in the skin. An experiment has shown lambs risk being infected through milk from infected ewes, but the lambs in the experiment also infected each other, making the risk of infection difficult to assess. The experiment did not continue long enough to show if the lambs developed symptoms, but merely that the abnormal prion was present in their bodies.

The pathogenesis of scrapie involves the lymphatic system. Once the agent is absorbed through the intestines, misfolded prions first appear and accumulate in the lymph nodes, especially in Peyer&#x27;s patches at the small intestine. Eventually, the infection invades the brain, often through the spinal cord or the medulla oblongata by creeping up the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, respectively.

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
Changes are mild at first; slight behavioral changes and an increase in chewing movements may occur. Ataxia and neurological signs then develop, and affected sheep struggle to keep up with the flock.

The signs and effects of scrapie typically appear 2-5 years after infection but may appear later. Once the onset of clinical signs has occurred, sheep typically live for 1–6 months. In some cases, they may live longer, but death is an inevitable consequence of the condition. Signs of scrapie vary between infected individual animals and develop slowly. Due to the nerve cell damage caused by the condition, affected animals may exhibit behavioral changes, tremor, pruritus, and locomotor incoordination.

Some sheep scratch excessively and show patches of wool loss and lesions on the skin. Scratching sheep over the rump area may lead to a nibbling reflex, which is characteristic for the condition.

Signs of a chronic systemic disease appear later, with weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, and death.

&quot;Post mortem&quot; examination is important for the diagnosis of scrapie. Histology of tissues shows accumulation of prions in the central nervous system, and immunohistochemical staining and ELISA can also be used to demonstrate the protein.

==Treatment and preventive action==
No treatment is available for affected sheep.

A test performed by sampling a small amount of lymphatic tissue from the third eyelid is now available.

In the UK in 2001, the Blair ministry implemented a &quot;National Scrapie Plan&quot;, which encouraged breeding from sheep that are genetically more resistant to scrapie. This is intended to eventually reduce the incidence of the disease in the UK sheep population. Scrapie occurs in Europe and North America, but to date, Australia and New Zealand (both major sheep-producing countries) are scrapie-free. In 2003, there was pressure from affected Canadian husbandry practitioners on the Chretien government and their CFIA to implement their own national scrapie plan.

Breeds such as Cheviot and Suffolk are more susceptible to scrapie than other breeds. Specifically, this is determined by the genes coding for the naturally occurring prion proteins. The most resistant sheep have a double set of &quot;ARR&quot; alleles, while sheep with the &quot;VRQ&quot; allele are the most susceptible. A simple blood test reveals the allele of the sheep, and many countries are actively breeding away the &quot;VRQ&quot; allele.

Out of fear of BSE-like transmission, many European countries banned some traditional sheep or goat products made without removing the spinal cord, such as smalahove and smokie.

In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called surround optical fiber immunoassay and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. The technique allowed detection of PrPSc after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals&#x27; brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. They could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals&#x27; lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrPSc could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of great value in surveillance as a blood- or urine-based screening test for scrapie.

In the United Kingdom, if a sheep is suspected or found to have scrapie in laboratory tests, it will be euthanised to prevent further suffering and to reduce the possibility of transmission. The Animal and Plant Health Agency will compensate farmers £30 for a cull animal and £90 for any others confirmed to have scrapie, and if scrapie is not confirmed, farmers can claim the &quot;market value&quot; of the sheep, up to £400 in compensation.

==Transmission/exposure pathways==
Various studies have indicated prions (PrPSC) which infect sheep and goats with the fatal transmissible encephalopathy known as scrapie are able to persist in soil for years without losing their pathogenic activity. Dissemination of prions into the environment can occur from several sources: mainly, infectious placenta or amniotic fluid of sheep and possibly environmental contamination by saliva or excrement.

Confirmatory testing for scrapie can only be achieved by applying immunohistochemistry of disease-associated prion protein (PrPSC) to tissues collected &quot;post mortem&quot;, including obex (a brainstem structure), retropharyngeal lymph node and palatine tonsil. A live animal diagnostic, not confirmatory, test was approved in 2008 for immunochemistry testing on rectal biopsy-derived lymphoid tissue by USDA.

Natural transmission of scrapie in the field seems to occur via the alimentary tract in the majority of cases, and scrapie-free sheep flocks can become infected on pastures where outbreaks of scrapie had been observed before. These findings point to a sustained contagion in the environment, notably in the soil.

Prion concentration in birth fluids does not alter the infectivity of the prions. Naturally or experimentally infected does and ewes transmit the infection to the lambs, even when placentas have little PrPSC. PrPSC is shed at a higher percentage in sheep placentas (52–72%) than in goat placenta (5–10%) in study trials at the USDA Agricultural Research Service.

Detectable PrPSC has been reported in the feces of sheep both in the terminal and the early preclinical stages of the disease, suggesting the prions are likely to be shed into the environment throughout the course of the disease. Several sources of prions in feces could be postulated, including environmental ingestion and swallowing infected saliva; however, the most likely source is shedding from the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Ruminant animals have specialized Peyer&#x27;s patches that, throughout the length of the ileum, amount to about 100,000 follicles, and all of these could be infected and shedding prions into the lumen.
Scrapie prions have been found in the Peyer&#x27;s patches of naturally infected asymptomatic lambs as young as four months of age.

===Exposure through contaminated vaccines===
* Contaminated Louping-ill vaccine, known as the &quot;1935 Moredun Louping-ill Vaccine Disaster&quot;. More than 1,500 sheep developed scrapie following vaccination. The vaccine was made using formalin-treated sheep brain tissue unknowingly contaminated with scrapie agent. Subsequent investigations showed that intracerebral inoculation of brain and spinal cord tissue from scrapie-infected sheep led to scrapie development in 60% of inoculated sheep, suggesting the presence of a filtrable virus as the probable infective agent.
* Contaminated &quot;Mycoplasma agalactiae&quot; vaccine. Sudden outbreaks in Italy in 1997 and 1998 were attributed to the administration of a contaminated vaccine, as the brain lesions and polymorphism in the affected animals were similar to those exposed to the same vaccine but different from those in unvaccinated sheep with scrapie. Molecular typing revealed the presence of two prion strains in vaccinated animals, suggesting accidental intra- and interspecies transmission due to the vaccine.

===Exposure through contaminated soil===
Ingestion of soil by grazing sheep has been measured in two soil types, at two stocking rates, and over two grazing seasons. Animals ingested up to 400 g soil per kg of body weight between May and November. Rainfall and stocking rate emerged as factors influencing ingestion. The effect of soil type and vegetation type was less evident.

The average weight of an adult sheep is around 250 pounds. If an adult sheep ate 400 g/kg of soil as predicted by D. McGrath &quot;et al.&quot;, then the average sheep would ingest about 45,000 g over six months, or 251 g per day. Assuming the soil was contaminated with prions (PrPSC) from feces or birth fluids, then potentially the sheep would become infected. The concentration of the prions in the soil is uncertain, and concentration is not directly proportional to infectivity. Factors affecting prion infectivity in the soil have been shown to include the length of time in the soil and the binding abilities of the soil.

For a detailed risk assessment of scrapie-contaminated soil, it was of major importance to analyze whether the detectable PrPSc in the soil extracts still exhibited oral infectivity after incubation times up to 29 months. A bioassay with Syrian hamsters was performed by feeding the animals with contaminated soil or aqueous soil extracts that had been collected after soil incubation for 26 and 29 months, respectively. Hamsters fed with contaminated soil exhibited their first scrapie-associated symptoms at two weeks to six months (95% CI) after the first feeding. The hamsters reached the terminal stage of scrapie at five to 21 months (95% CI) after the first feeding. This indicated substantial amounts of persistent infectivity in soil that had been incubated for 26 and 29 months. In Iceland in 1978, a program was implemented to eradicate scrapie, and affected flocks were culled, premises were disinfected, and sheep houses were burnt; after two to three years, the premises were restocked with lambs from scrapie-free areas. Between 1978 and 2004, scrapie recurred on 33 farms. Nine recurrences occurred 14–21 years after culling as a result of persistent environmental contamination with PrPSc.

The binding abilities of different soil types have been shown to enhance disease penetrance into a population. Soil containing the common clay mineral montmorillonite (Mte) and kaolinite (Kte) binds more effectively with the prions than soil containing quartz. Enhanced transmissibility of soil-bound prions may explain the environmental spread of scrapie despite low levels shed into the environment. The mechanism by which Mte or other soil components enhances the transmissibility of particle-bound prions remains to be clarified. Prion binding to Mte or other soil components may partially protect PrPSC from denaturation or proteolysis in the digestive tract, allowing more disease agents to be taken up from the gut. Adsorption of PrPSc soil may alter the aggregation state of the protein, shifting the size distribution toward more infectious prion protein particles, thereby increasing the infectious units. For prion disease to be transmitted via ingestion of prion-contaminated soil, prions must also remain infectious by the oral route of exposure. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin investigated the oral infectivity of Mte-bound and soil-bound prions. The effects of prion source (via infected brain homogenate and purified PrPSc) and dose on penetrance (proportion of animals eventually exhibiting clinical signs of scrapie) and incubation period (time to onset of clinical symptoms) were evaluated. About 38% of animals receiving orally 200 ng of unbound, clarified PrPSc derived from soil exhibited clinical symptoms, with an incubation period for infected animals of 203 to 633 days. All animals orally dosed with an equivalent amount of Mte-bound PrPSc manifested disease symptoms in 195 to 637 days. By contrast, animals orally receiving Mte soil alone or one-tenth as much unbound clarified PrPSc (20 ng) remained asymptomatic throughout the course of the experiment. These data established that Mte-bound prions remain infectious via the oral route of exposure, and that the binding agent Mte increases disease penetrance, enhancing the efficiency of oral transmission.

Exposure through contaminated hay mites

&quot;With scrapie, the archetypical TSE, which is a natural disease in sheep and goats, the disease can appear suddenly in a flock in the absence of any known exposure to infected flocks (Palsson, 1979). Finally, fields in Iceland, that were left empty for up to 3 years after the destruction of scrapie-infected flocks, were repopulated with known scrapie-free sheep, and some of the sheep in this latter group subsequently developed scrapie (Palsson, 1979). This last &#x27;experiment in nature&#x27; has yielded similar results a number of times in Iceland and the United Kingdom. In one Icelandic farm, flocks have been eradicated three times; each time, the farm was left without sheep for 2 years, and after restocking with sheep from scrapie-free areas, the disease reappeared. Several years ago, a suggestion was made (S Sigurdarson, personal communication) that hay mites would be a good candidate as a vector for scrapie; this led to the infection of mice with mite samples prepared from hay obtained from five Icelandic farms. Ten of these 71 mice became sick after injection with mite preparations from three of the five farms (Wisniewski et al, 1996; Rubenstein et al, 1998). The incubation periods ranged from 340 days to 626 days, and these mice had the protease-resistant form PrpSc, of a host-coded glycoprotein, PrPc . The protease-resistant form is a marker of TSE disease (Prusiner, 1991; Parchi et al, 1996). For some of these clinically positive mice, the banding pattern on WB analysis was unique (Wisniewski et al, 1996; Rubenstein et al, 1998).&quot;

===Transmission summary===
Prions (PrPSc) are shed from sheep and goats in birth fluids, feces, and other excrement. The concentration of the prions is uncertain, but is not directly proportional to infectivity. Sheep ingest a considerable amount of soil, so soil represents a plausible environmental reservoir of scrapie prions, which can persist in the environment for years. Longevity of the prions and the attachment of soil particles likely influences the persistence and infectivity of prions in the environment.

Effective methods of inactivating prions in the soil are currently lacking, and the effects of natural degradation mechanisms on prion infectivity are largely unknown. An improved understanding of the processes affecting the mobility, persistence and bioavailability of prions in soil is needed for the management of prion-contaminated environments. A system for estimating the prion-binding capacity of soil on farms using simple soil analysis may allow an estimate of the prion risk in the environment, and whether altering prion binding by the use of soil amendments may help to mitigate the infectious prions. Lichens, specifically, &quot;Parmelia sulcata&quot;, &quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot; and &quot;Lobaria pulmonaria&quot;, may have potential for reducing the number of prions because some lichen species contain proteases that show promise in breaking down the prion. Further work to clone and characterize the proteases, assess their effects on prion infectivity, and determine which component organism or organisms present in lichens produce or influence the protease activity is warranted and is currently under investigation.

== Genetics ==
The prion gene that codes for the prion protein is highly conserved in most mammals, meaning the gene is similar and present in most species of mammals. Three locations on the prion protein gene have been identified as highly polymorphic and may have an effect on scrapie: codons 136, 154, and 171. Codon 154 has not shown any evidence of having a high effect on scrapie susceptibility, but is most likely having an effect on incubation time of the disease. Codons 136 and 171 are thought to control the incubation time as well as the susceptibility of the disease, and are the ones the USDA uses in its breeding standard. Codon 171 has been determined to be the major genetic factor in scrapie susceptibility.

<text>Jason Bradford Priestley (born August 28, 1969) is a Canadian-American actor and television director. He is best known as the virtuous Brandon Walsh on the television series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1990–1998, 2000). He is also known for his roles as Richard &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzpatrick in the show &quot;Call Me Fitz&quot; (2010–2013) and for his role as Matt Shade in the Canadian series &quot;Private Eyes&quot; (2016–2021).

==Early life==
Jason Bradford Priestley was born on August 28, 1969, in North Vancouver, British Columbia. His mother, Sharon Kirk, was an actress and acting coach. He is a graduate of Argyle Secondary School in North Vancouver. He has an older sister, actress Justine Priestley, and two step-siblings, Karin and Kristi. He became a naturalized American citizen in 2007.

==Career==
Priestley first started his television career doing commercials for companies such as Fletcher&#x27;s Meats and then guest-starring as Bobby Conrad a.k.a. Roberto Coronado Jr., a mobster&#x27;s grandson, in the early 1987 episode &quot;A Piece of Cake&quot; from the fourth and final season of the television series &quot;Airwolf&quot;, and appeared in two episodes of &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; in 1987–88, as &#x27;Pencil&#x27; on Quantum Leap (E1S8 May 1989), then moved on to the 1989 short-lived sitcom &quot;Sister Kate&quot;, which starred Stephanie Beacham. He played Todd, one of the foster children under the care of Sister Kate, an English nun.
In 1990, Priestley was chosen as Brandon Walsh on the hit series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. The show garnered worldwide fame and popularity and made Priestley a teen idol. He was nominated for two Golden Globes for his work on the show. He also directed 15 of the show&#x27;s episodes. He remained on the show until 1998, when Brandon moved to Washington, D.C. Brandon was the last Walsh to leave the show; however, Priestley would continue to serve as an executive producer until the show ended in 2000.

Priestley joined the cast of &quot;Tru Calling&quot; as Jack Harper during 2004 and 2005. He was also a regular on the 2006 program &quot;Love Monkey&quot;. His television work also includes the WB show &quot;What I Like About You&quot; and a February 2006 appearance on &quot;Without a Trace&quot;. Priestley has also made several films, his most notable role perhaps being in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Love and Death on Long Island&quot;, in which he played a teen idol struggling to be taken seriously as an actor. He directed the 19th episode in the final season of &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. He also directed two episodes of &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;: &quot;Slice of Life&quot; and &quot;Just Say No.&quot; They appeared on August 26, 2008, and September 9, 2008, on ABC Family.

On July 15, 2007, he returned to series television as one of the lead males in Lifetime Television&#x27;s comedy–drama &quot;Side Order of Life&quot;. Priestley made a guest appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; in 2008. He played Blake, Earl&#x27;s better-looking and more successful cousin. That year, Priestley directed five episodes of &quot;Secret Life&quot;. Priestley directed the episode when Tori Spelling returned to &quot;90210&quot;. In 2009 Priestley directed and co-produced all 12 episodes of the Web series &quot;The Lake&quot; on &quot;TheWB.com&quot;. In December 2009 along with Dougray Scott, Brian Cox, and Eddie Izzard, Priestley was featured in &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;, written by Patrick Harbinson, whose credits include &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. The drama is based on John Wyndham&#x27;s best-selling post-apocalyptic novel, &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;.

Priestley directed his former co-star Luke Perry in the Hallmark Channel movie &quot;Goodnight for Justice&quot;, which aired in January 2011. He guest-starred as one half of a con artist couple alongside Jennifer Finnigan in a sixth-season episode of USA&#x27;s &quot;Psych&quot; and also appeared in the music video &quot;Boys&quot; by Britney Spears. Priestley starred as the main character of the HBO Canada TV show &quot;Call Me Fitz&quot; from 2010 to 2013. It ended after its fourth season in December 2013. In August 2011 Priestley joined the cast of sci-fi television show &quot;Haven&quot;, in a recurring role during its second season and made two appearances in the final season. He also directed two episodes.

Priestley&#x27;s feature film directorial debut was the independent road trip comedy &quot;Cas &amp; Dylan&quot;, starring Richard Dreyfuss and Tatiana Maslany.

In April 2013, Priestley appeared in Canadian Stage&#x27;s production of &quot;Race&quot;, a David Mamet play, in Toronto at the Bluma Appel Theater. In 2015, Priestley starred alongside Gael García Bernal in &quot;Zoom,&quot; a comedy directed by Pedro Morelli that premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.

In May 2016, Priestley began starring in the Global TV Network comedy–drama series &quot;Private Eyes,&quot; in the role of Matt Shade, a former hockey player turned private detective.

In August 2016, Priestley was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

Jason Priestley was nominated for best lead actor in a comedy series for The Movie Network&#x27;s Nova Scotia-filmed &quot;Call Me Fitz&quot;.

In 2013, Priestley directed one episode of the CTV television series &quot;Satisfaction&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1999, Priestley crashed his Porsche car into a telephone pole in Hollywood Hills and was arrested for driving while under the influence. His driver&#x27;s license was suspended for a year, and he was ordered to complete an alcohol-management program.

Priestley and make-up artist Ashlee Peterson married on February 2, 1999, and divorced 11 months later on January 2, 2000. On May 14, 2005, Priestley married Naomi Lowde, also a make-up artist. On July 2, 2007, the couple had a daughter, Ava Veronica. On April 13, 2009, Priestley announced that he and his wife were expecting their second child. On July 9, 2009, the couple had a son, Dashiell Orson.

On July 9, 2007, he revealed on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; that he had become an American citizen several weeks earlier.

Priestley&#x27;s sister, Justine, is also an actor and appeared in a couple of episodes of the &quot;90210&quot; spin-off &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, in 1996.

In 2013, the restaurant chain Tim Hortons created a new doughnut in Priestley&#x27;s honor, called The Priestley. It was not rolled out on a nationwide scale, however.

On May 6, 2014, HarperOne published Priestley&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Jason Priestley: A Memoir&quot;.

==Motorsports==
Priestley&#x27;s hobbies include race-car driving. He rallied a Toyota Celica All-Trac ST185 in the SCCA Pro Rally Series during the early to mid-1990s. He has provided commentary and interviews of racers for ABC&#x27;s TV coverage of IndyCar racing. Priestley transitioned toward circuit racing in 1996. Over the following two seasons, he drove Ford Mustangs in IMSA GTS, USRRC GT1, and Motorola Cup competition with Multimatic Motorsports. In 1999, he participated in the first Gumball 3000 rally, driving a Lotus Esprit V-8. On August 11, 2002, he was seriously injured during a practice run at the Kentucky Speedway when his Indy Pro Series car crashed into a wall at nearly 180 miles per hour.

According to a January 2008 Associated Press article, it was announced that Priestley would become a joint owner in a new IndyCar Series team. The new team was known as Rubicon Race Team managed by co-owner Jim Freudenberg. They initially entered a car in the 2008 Indianapolis 500. The car was prepared by Indianapolis-based Sam Schmidt Motorsports and the driver was Max Papis.

In the article, Priestley said, &quot;I&#x27;m excited to be able to spend the month of May in Indy with my good friends and be a part of the greatest open wheel race. . . . It&#x27;s been more than five years since my accident, and it&#x27;s going to be so good to get to see everyone.&quot; Despite the team&#x27;s enthusiasm, it suffered a crash during the second weekend of qualifying, then had subsequent gearbox problems and failed to qualify for the race.

Priestley was among the owners of the FAZZT Race Team, which competed in the IndyCar Series in 2010 with Canadian racer Alex Tagliani. The car, numbered 77 and sponsored by Bowers &amp; Wilkins, was bought out in 2011 by Sam Schmidt Motorsports. With Tagliani retained by the team, he won the pole at the 2011 Indianapolis 500. In October 2011, two-time and defending Indy 500 winner Dan Wheldon took over at Kentucky. At the season-ending IZOD IndyCar World Championship at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Wheldon was killed in a 15-car crash.

==Promotional activity for Barenaked Ladies==
Priestley is a big fan of the band Barenaked Ladies and went to many of their California concerts in the early to mid-1990s. He eventually met the band and in his desire to help them succeed, suggested that he direct the music video for &quot;The Old Apartment,&quot; and use his fame to persuade American stations to air it. He did just that, and also invited the band to play at the &quot;Peach Pit After Dark&quot; on an episode of &quot;90210&quot;. Lead singer Ed Robertson continues to cite him as being instrumental in their American success. His final notable contribution to the band came when he directed a feature-length documentary about the band&#x27;s 1999 whirlwind of success titled &quot;Barenaked in America&quot;, intending to capture on film the fun he had while riding around on the tour bus with the band.

<text>The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is the court of last resort and final appeal in Canada. Cases successfully appealed to the Court are generally of national importance. Once a case is decided, the Court publishes written reasons for the decision, that consist of one or more opinions from any number of the nine justices. Understanding the background of the cases, the reasoning and the authorship can be important and insightful, as each judge may have varying beliefs in legal theory and interpretation.

<doc id="221697" wikidata="Q111658718" url="?curid=221697" title="Blacklisting">
<text>Blacklisting is the action of a group or authority compiling a blacklist of people, countries or other entities to be avoided or distrusted as being deemed unacceptable to those making the list; if people are on a blacklist, then they are considered to have done something wrong, or they are considered to be untrustworthy. As a verb, blacklist can mean to put an individual or entity on such a list. A blacklist is synonymous with a list of banned persons or organizations, and is the opposite of a whitelist.

== Origins of the term ==
The English dramatist Philip Massinger used the phrase &quot;black list&quot; in his 1639 tragedy &quot;The Unnatural Combat&quot;.

After the restoration of the English monarchy brought Charles II of England to the throne in 1660, a list of regicides named those to be punished for the execution of his father. The state papers of Charles II say &quot;If any innocent soul be found in this black list, let him not be offended at me, but consider whether some mistaken principle or interest may not have misled him to vote&quot;. In a 1676 history of the events leading up to the Restoration, James Heath (a supporter of Charles II) alleged that Parliament had passed an Act requiring the sale of estates, &quot;And into this black list the Earl of Derby was now put, and other unfortunate Royalists&quot;.

Edward Gibbon wrote in &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1776) of Andronicus that &quot;His memory was stored with a black list of the enemies and rivals, who had traduced his merit, opposed his greatness, or insulted his misfortunes&quot;.

== History ==

=== Employment ===

The first published reference to blacklisting of an employee dates from 1774. This became a significant employment issue in American mining towns and company towns, where blacklisting could mean a complete loss of livelihood for workers who went on strike. The 1901 Report of the Industrial Commission stated &quot;There was no doubt in the minds of workingmen of the existence of the blacklisting system, though it was practically impossible to obtain evidence of it.&quot; It cited a news report that in 1895 a former conductor on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad committed suicide, having been out of work ever since a strike: &quot;Wherever he went, the blacklist was ahead of him&quot;.

Though the USA National Labor Relations Act of 1935 outlawed punitive blacklists against employees who supported trade unions or criticised their employers, the practice continued in common use in the USA. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 made amendments which sustained blacklisting by affirming the right of employers to be anti-union, and by requiring trade union leaders to make loyalty oaths which had the same effect as the Hollywood blacklist. Since then, lawsuits for unfair dismissal have led to blacklisting being covert or informal, but it remains common.

In 1981 following the PATCO workers&#x27; refusal to return to work, the Reagan administration fired the 11,345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored the order, and banned them from federal service for life.

==== Hollywood blacklist ====

The Hollywood blacklist was an entertainment industry blacklist instituted in 1947 to block screenwriters and other Hollywood professionals who were purported to have Communist sympathies from obtaining employment. It started by listing 151 entertainment industry professionals and lasted until 1960 when it was effectively broken by the acknowledgement that blacklisted professionals had been working under assumed names for many years.

=== Spanish Civil War and communists blacklisted ===
At least one Scottish volunteer (George Drever) in the International Brigades who went to Spain to fight Franco&#x27;s fascists and who was also well known in the British Communist Party in the 1930s was informed by the police Special Branch that his failure to progress in military or career was due to his volunteering in this cause and his beliefs.

=== World Wars I and II ===
During World War I, the British government adopted a &quot;blacklist&quot; based on an Order in Council of 23 December 1915, prohibiting British subjects from trade with specified firms and individuals in neutral countries; the lists were published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;.

In the summer of 1940, the SS printed a secret list called &quot;Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.&quot; (&quot;Special Search List Great Britain&quot;) as part of Nazi Germany&#x27;s preparations for invasion code-named Operation Sea Lion – when this booklet was found after the war, it was commonly called the Black Book and described as a blacklist.

=== Medical context ===

In 1907, the Transvaal Medical Union in South Africa blacklisted patients if they could not pay cash in advance. There was a physical list kept by the community of physicians.

=== 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum ===

After the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum, ruling party deputy Luis Tascón published on his website a database of more than 2,400,000 Venezuelans who had signed the petition to recall President Hugo Chávez, together with their national identity card numbers (&quot;cédula&quot;). The list &quot;made sectarianism official&quot;, and Venezuelans who signed against Chávez were denied jobs, benefits, and documents, and often subjected to harassment. Once the list was posted, Chávez, on a &quot;Venezolana de Televisión&quot; broadcast, encouraged use of the website to &quot;verify illicit use of national identity cards&quot;. Roger Capella, Minister of Health declared that &quot;those who signed against President Chávez would be fired because they are committing an act of terrorism&quot;. There was a public outcry, in particular by the organization Súmate, and because of reports that people who worked for the government were fired, denied work, or denied issuance of official documents because of their appearance on the list. In July 2004, access to the database under management of Comando Maisanta was granted to members of the &quot;Batallones Bolivarianos de Internet (BBI)&quot; (Internet Bolivarian Battalions), which previously had to register on Tascón&#x27;s website to gain access under the strict requisite that they had not signed the petition for the referendum.

== Computing ==

In computing, a blacklist is an access control system that denies entry to a specific list (or a defined range) of users, programs, or network addresses.

<text>Timmins ( ) is a city in northeastern Ontario, Canada, located on the Mattagami River. The city is the fourth-largest city in the Northeastern Ontario region with a population of 41,145 at the 2021 Canadian census and an estimated population of 44,819 in 2023. The city&#x27;s economy is based on natural resource extraction. It is supported by industries related to lumbering, and to the mining of gold, zinc, copper, nickel, and silver. Timmins serves as a regional service and distribution centre. 

The city has a large Francophone community, with more than 50% of the residents bilingual in French and English.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Archaeological evidence indicates that the area has been inhabited for at least 6,500 years. The first inhabitants were nomadic peoples of the Shield Archaic culture. At the time of European contact, the area was inhabited primarily by the Cree and Ojibwe peoples. 

The first Europeans to make contact with the local Indigenous peoples were French explorers in the late 1600s.

The first attempt at a permanent European presence in the area did not come until 1785, nearly two decades after Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War and took over its territory in North America east of the Mississippi River. Philip Turnor, a surveyor and cartographer for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, established a trading outpost at Fredrick House Lake, about north-east of present-day downtown Timmins. 

Although beaver fur was plentiful and still in demand in Europe, the trading post was not successful. Nearby competition, and the difficulty of navigating the Abitibi and Fredrick House rivers by canoe, often resulted in the post being unsupplied.

Frederick House Post was functionally abandoned in 1812, when a man named Capascoos killed all 12 of the trading post&#x27;s staff, as well as looted and damaged the building. Capascoos was never caught, and the building was never rebuilt. However, temporary log shelters were put in place nearby to facilitate fur trading until 1821, when the post was officially declared closed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

More than a century later, in 1906, Treaty 9 was signed between Anishinaabe (Algonquin and Ojibwe), Omushkegowuk Cree communities, and the Canadian Crown. It required the Mattagami First Nation to move to the north of Mattagami Lake and to cede territory.

=== Porcupine Gold Rush ===

The presence of gold in the area was long known to the local indigenous people, and the few Europeans who had settled nearby. Outcroppings of gold-bearing quartz were a familiar sight in the region, but there was little commercial interest due to the area&#x27;s inaccessibility. 

The extension of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway to Cochrane in 1907, allowed prospectors to more easily access the area. This sparked an interest in the region&#x27;s natural resources, leading to the Porcupine Gold Rush. The first known prospectors were a team led by Reuben D&#x27;Aigle. They set out for Porcupine Lake in 1907 and dug several test pits in the surrounding area, but none of them had near the amount of gold which D&#x27;Aigle&#x27;s team was seeking. They eventually abandoned their tools in the last pit they dug, approximately 8 km west of Porcupine Lake, and returned home. 

Two years later in 1909, a prospector duo consisting of Benny Hollinger and Alex Gillies arrived in the Porcupine region. They met up with another group, led by Jack Wilson. Earlier in the season he had found a &quot;dome&quot; of quartz that contained large veins of gold stretching several hundred feet in length and in width. This section was later exploited and developed as the Dome Mine. 

Wilson advised Hollinger &amp; Gillies that all the good sites in a radius had been claimed, so the duo went slightly further west. There they stumbled upon D&#x27;Aigle&#x27;s abandoned test pits and tools. While Gilles was inspecting the abandoned pits, Hollinger pulled a bit of moss from a nearby quartz outcropping and revealed a large vein of gold. Gillies later noted that he had found a boot print pressed into some moss covering the gold vein. This print was believed left by one of D&#x27;Aigle&#x27;s team two years before. They had departed unaware of the large vein under their feet.

Two Mattawa shopkeeper brothers, named Noah Timmins and Henry Timmins, arrived in the area in 1910. They began purchasing shares of local mines, and bought Benny Hollinger&#x27;s share from him. 

Around the same time, Scottish businessman Sandy McIntyre discovered the McIntyre Mine near Pearl Lake, four miles away. Hollinger Mines was incorporated later that year with five equal partners consisting of Noah and Henry Timmins; Duncan and John McMartin (also brothers); and Mattawa attorney David Dunlap.

==== &quot;Moss slip&quot; story ====
A popular founding myth of Timmins and the Porcupine area states that a man named Harry Preston slipped on moss and uncovered gold. In some versions of the story, he is responsible for triggering the Porcupine Gold Rush. However, historical records contradict both claims.

Harry Preston arrived in the Porcupine area as a part of a team led by Jack Wilson in June 1909, where they discovered a large &quot;dome shaped quartz outcrop&quot;. Wilson was said to have been the first to notice gold as the Sun struck the quartz.

The only comparable mention of moss comes from Hollinger and Gilles, who arrived in the area two months after Wilson&#x27;s team. According to Gilles&#x27;s report, while he inspected D’Aigle’s abandoned work, Hollinger was looking at some nearby quartz when he peeled back a bit of moss, revealing a large vein of gold.

Additionally, historians generally agree that expansion of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway, which connected Central Ontario to Northern Ontario, was instrumental in triggering the Porcupine Gold Rush because it made the area accessible. The Canadian Pacific Railway expansion to was also critical, as it enabled travellers from Toronto to go directly north instead of taking a time-consuming detour around Eastern Ontario.

=== Settlement and company towns ===
A company town was founded near modern-day Gillies Lake, to house Hollinger Mines employees. Mine manager Alphonse &quot;Al&quot; Paré named the growing mining camp &quot;Timmins&quot;, after his uncle, Noah Timmins, who was then the President of Hollinger Mines. Two more settlements were founded by competing mines: The &quot;Porcupine/Dome&quot; camp was situated on Porcupine Lake, and owned by Dome Mines. &quot;Schumacher&quot; camp was situated on Pearl Lake, and owned by McIntyre Mines.

Joe Torlone noted in his dissertation that Timmins was never truly a company town. The combined mines behaved more like a &quot;very influential industrial citizen&quot;, rather than a single company that dominated all aspects of civilian life. As the worker population grew, these camps started to mesh together as a single town. (Torlone later served as the municipal Chief Administrative Officer.) 

==== Great Porcupine Fire ====

On July 10, 1911, unusually hot and dry temperatures caused small fires to ignite at the Porcupine settlement. These were initially described as a series of &quot;bushfires&quot;, but strong winds spread them into the dry forest and they expanded. Evacuation efforts began on the morning of July 11, with women and children being ferried to the opposite end of Porcupine Lake. 

The small fires eventually merged, and grew into a single wall of fire, estimated to be at least wide. The fire destroyed the Porcupine mining camp at around 3:30pm, and continued as far north as Cochrane. The total number of deaths remains uncertain, with the lowest estimates being 73 and the highest suggesting there were more than 200 dead. A number of people drowned after fleeing into the lake in an attempt to escape the heat and smoke; others were killed by smoke while still trapped underground in the mine. 

The executives of the Dome Mine held meetings about reopening within two days of the fire. The camp was quickly rebuilt with help from various communities around Ontario, and operations soon resumed.

The fire burned the thin layers of moss and soil characteristic of a Canadian Shield landscape. This revealed previously unknown veins of gold and other minerals, which helped facilitate economic recovery efforts.

==== Incorporation, growth, and World Wars ====
Given the fire, and the need to replace housing as well as serve newly arrived refugees from the Porcupine camp, Noah Timmins to began planning a townsite at the Timmins camp. The first lots went up for sale on September 4, 1911, ranging in price from $5 to $10 ($135-$265 in 2024) for residential lots, and from $75 to $1,000 ($2,000-$25,000 in 2024) for commercial lots. Migrants were attracted to the new lands for sale, and the Timmins camp quickly surpassed the Porcupine and Schumacher camps in population. Timmins was incorporated as a municipality on January 1, 1912.

In November 1912, 1,200 members of the Western Federation of Miners Local 145 held a strike at all three mines in response to a proposal to lower their wages. Mine operators hired gun thugs, who fired on the picket line and were ordered out by the provincial government. After months without work, many men chose to leave the settlement; only 500 miners returned to work in July 1913. The strike won the men a nine-hour workday and a pay increase.

In 1917, a dam was built at Kenogamissi Falls, downriver from Mattagami Lake, to provide power to Timmins and the surrounding area, Mattagami Lake was consequently flooded.

A recruitment campaign for soldiers during the First World War was successful in enlisting around 600 men out of the less than 2,000 total residents at the time. The miners were coveted by the Canadian Expeditionary Force for their ability to dig trenches, and experience with handling explosives. News of the war and letters from soldiers abroad were frequently published in the town&#x27;s local newspaper, The Porcupine Advance (TPA). After receiving news of armistice, major celebrations were held all around the Timmins area, as described by a journalist for TPA:
The Great Depression did not adversely affect the economy of the area, and jobs were available in mining and lumber.

During the Second World War, around a third of the city&#x27;s population were enlisted into the armed forces. Timmins had its own bomber squadron known as &quot;Porcupine Squadron No. 433&quot;, a heavy bomber unit of No. 6 group RCAF in Skipton-on-Swale, England. Timmins&#x27; economy suffered slightly during this period as women were prohibited from working in mines under the Ontario Mining Act, leaving no one to replace the enlisted miners.

===Decline and recent history===
In the 1950s, Mattagami 71, the reserve of the Mattagami First Nation was once again relocated, this time to its present day location, south of Mattagami Lake.

By the mid 1960s, the majority of the original mines had depleted their gold content and mines began to close. Hollinger Mine was closed in 1968, having produced nearly 20 million troy ounces of gold. Twenty years later in 1988, the McIntyre mines ceased operations having produced around 11 million troy ounces of gold.In 1973, 35 townships covering , including Porcupine, South Porcupine, Schumacher, and Timmins were organized into the City of Timmins.

The city&#x27;s population peaked in the mid 1990s, when the city became a regional service and distribution centre for Northeastern Ontario. However, with the exception of a slight bump in 2011, the population has been consistently declining. 

Rail service to Timmins was discontinued in 1990, but is expected to return within the next decade.

The last of the original three mines to close was the Dome Mine, which was closed in 2017, after 107 years of operation, and about 17 million troy ounces of gold produced.

==Climate==
Timmins is near the northern periphery of the hemiboreal humid continental climate (Dfb). Timmins has cold and snowy winters, being located in Northern Ontario. Temperatures in late summer and autumn tend to be among the coolest for any non-coastal major city in Canada. During the late spring and summer, temperatures can rise considerably, sometimes accompanied by high humidity and unstable air masses. The highest temperature ever recorded in Timmins was on July 12, 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on February 1, 1962.

==Demographics==


In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Timmins had a population of 41,145 living in 17,886 of its 19,390 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 41,788. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


===Language===
In Timmins, according to the 2021 census, 60.26%% of the population reported English as their mother tongue (Anglophone), 34.25%% reported French (Francophone) as their first language, and 5.49% reported a non-official language, neither English nor French, as their first language (Allophone). 50.8% of the population is bilingual in English and French.

=== Jewish community ===
From the foundation of the city, Jewish emigrants, mostly from Russia and Eastern Europe came to the town in order to work in the mines industry. In 1917 Rabbi Yaakov Schulman arrived in the city and was in charge of religious needs, such as kosher meat. In 1925 there were 200 Jews living in the city. In that year the Jewish community was officially established. The community was not isolated and maintained good relationships with non-Jews, especially emigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe, who spoke the same languages they did. Only in the 1930s were actual community institutions built, such as a synagogue and a school.

Since 1928 the Jewish community has held an annual Purim ball. The ball was mixed: Jews and non-Jews, men and women. Part of the ball was a beauty pageant named &quot;malkat Ester&quot;.

The Jewish population peaked around the 1950s, when it included around 160 families.

In the early 1970s the Timmins synagogue was closed due to a decrease in the town&#x27;s Jewish population.

== Culture and contemporary life ==

===Tourism===

Some of the main tourist attractions within the city include: The Timmins Museum and National Exhibition Centre, Cedar Meadows Wilderness Tours, Mount Jamieson Resort (formerly known as Kamiskotia Snow Resort), Porcupine Ski Runners Cross-Country Trails and Chalet, Hollinger Golf Club, Spruce Needles Golf Club, the Sandy Falls Golf Club, the McIntyre Community Building and the Timmins Snowmobile Club. Snowmobiling impacts the Timmins economy, as tourists travel from all over North America to explore area trails.

Hollinger Park is one of the city&#x27;s main recreational spaces. The park is divided in two sections, the north side being the public park area, with the south side having a regulation sized baseball diamond and two soccer fields for more organized outdoor recreational endeavours. The baseball park has been home to the Timmins Men&#x27;s Baseball League since 1985. Former Timmins resident Shania Twain played a concert at Hollinger Park on July 1, 1999. An estimated 22,000 people attended the outdoor concert.

The Pioneer Museum is located northeast of the city centre in Connaught, a community of 400 people. Nearby communities include Barbers Bay, Dugwal, Finn Road, Hoyle, Ice Chest Lake, McIntosh Springs and Nighthawk. Local history in the area dates back over 300 years.

La Galeruche Art Gallery, located at 32 Mountjoy Street North (Centre Culturel La Ronde), provides local francophone artists with a venue to exhibit and sell their work. The building has since been torn down, but plans to rebuild are underway, as of March 2022.

The Porcupine Miner&#x27;s Memorial tribute is a statue of the miner, head frame and tablets bearing the names of 594 miners killed in mining accidents were unveiled in 2008. The following year, the statues of a mother and two children were unveiled to commemorate those families left behind.

The Timmins Public Library was constructed in 2005 with locally manufactured products, using wood as the main structural material, making efficient use of natural resources while reducing construction waste. The eco-friendly design was recognized by the Green Building Initiative, and the building achieved a 3 Green Globes rating for its efficient use of resources and sustainable development.

<text>Daniel Domingo Salamanca Urey (8 July 1869 – 17 July 1935) was a Bolivian lawyer and politician who served as the 33rd president of Bolivia from 1931 to 1934.

He was overthrown in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; on 27 November 1934, during the country&#x27;s disastrous Chaco War with Paraguay. Bolivian historians have referred to him as &quot;El Hombre Símbolo&quot; (the symbolic man), as a president who carefully cultivated an appearance of integrity and nationalism.

==Political career==
Born in Cochabamba, Salamanca studied law at the Higher University of San Simón, before being elected to Bolivia&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies in 1899 for the Liberal Party. Two years later, President José Manuel Pando appointed him Finance Minister. Salamanca was a prominent opposition leader in 1907 and roundly attacked the Pinilla-Soler Treaty that had divided the Chaco region between Bolivia and Paraguay. Salamanca eventually split with the Liberals, however, and helped to found the new Republican Party, running unsuccessfully for Vice-President in 1917. Following the split of a faction opposed to the growing (some would say ruthless) ambitions of Republican leader Bautista Saavedra, the ascetic, professorial Salamanca founded, with a number of other men including Juan Maria Escalier, the so-called Genuine Republican Party (&quot;Partido Republicano Genuino&quot;). Salamanca himself ran for president on the &quot;Genuino&quot; ticket in the elections of 1925, but lost to Saavedra&#x27;s handpicked successor, Hernando Siles.

Shaken by his defeats, Salamanca retired from politics and dedicated himself to teaching law. In the aftermath of the military overthrow of Hernando Siles in 1930, largely as a result of the Great Depression, Salamanca was asked to head a Republicano Genuino-Liberal coalition, with him at the head of the ticket and Liberal leader José Luis Tejada as his vice-presidential running mate. Salamanca was elected and took office in March 1931.

==Presidency==
Immediately upon assuming office, Salamanca introduced an unpopular austerity program and clamped down on political opposition to his government. In what was likely a measure to avert public attention to the economic problems still facing the country, he also revived hostilities with Paraguay in the disputed Chaco region. Indeed, Salamanca had been for a long time one of the &quot;hawks&quot; in Bolivian politics, advocating firmness against Paraguay in the territorial dispute. Upon taking office, his motto became &quot;We must stand firm in the Chaco.&quot; Given that the parched region of the Gran Chaco (largely uninhabited) had been under dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay ever since the creation of both republics, each proceeded to establish a line of small garrisons (&quot;fortines&quot;), simply to establish a national presence and press their claims. Sporadic battles would occur, but cooler heads tended to prevail, especially because neither Bolivia nor Paraguay (the only landlocked and poorest countries in South America) could afford a full-scale war over the Chaco. Neither, however, relinquished much in their claim to the entire Chaco region either.

All of this changed when oil was found on the foothills of the Andes, deep in Bolivian territory. It was then widely assumed that the nearby Chaco also contained oil, possibly in vast quantities. In addition, the explosive economic and political situation prompted President Salamanca to use the dispute to shore up national unity and distract attention from his government&#x27;s shortcomings. He ordered a stepped-up effort at establishing more fortines wherever Paraguay wasn&#x27;t established already. A Bolivian army exploration unit was sent deep into the Chaco early in 1932, whereupon they chanced to find a large lake in the middle of the desert-like scrubland. It was a perfect location for a permanent garrison. Unfortunately, the lake—named Pitiantuta by the Paraguayans—turned out to be occupied by the Paraguayan military. Upon the arrival of the Bolivian expedition, a battle ensued and the Paraguayan troops fled. This, in essence, started the disastrous Chaco War (1932–1935).

The quick escalation of the war only exacerbated already severe economic problems in Bolivia (and in Paraguay), while causing many thousands of casualties. To make matters worse, Salamanca had very poor relations with the Bolivian high command from the beginning of the conflict, when he demoted a Bolivian general and placed the German Hans Kundt at the head of the country&#x27;s armed forces at war. Kundt had led a military mission to Bolivia prior to World War I. A string of devastating defeats on the southern front of the war at the hands of the Paraguayans, who knew the terrain much better than the Bolivians (most of whom hailed from the Altiplano Highlands) precipitated Kundt&#x27;s replacement by General Enrique Peñaranda at the end of 1933. Salamanca&#x27;s relationship with the general only got worse, as the mercurial president (then in his mid 60s) tended to blame the military leadership for the continuing setbacks on the field. Things came to a head when Salamanca decided to replace Peñaranda and a number of his increasingly mutinous commandants.

==Coup==
On 27 November 1934, the Bolivian generals deposed Salamanca while he visited their headquarters at Villamontes to explain the reasons for the changes. Peñaranda and his coconspirators (Colonel Toro, Major Busch, and others) in the end decided to keep democratic appearances intact, and replaced Salamanca with his Vice President, the decidedly more pliable José Luis Tejada of the Liberal Party. It has been alleged that Tejada was in on the plot itself.

The elderly and sickly Salamanca at that point was allowed to &quot;retire&quot; to his native Cochabamba, where he died of stomach cancer less than a year later in July 1935, only days after the establishment of the cease-fire. A highly controversial figure, he was blamed by many for the war, while others respected him enormously as a man who did all he could to maintain his country&#x27;s foothold on the Chaco without resorting to warfare but was betrayed by a mutinous and incompetent military high command. The rather dour, intellectual Salamanca is perhaps best remembered by two celebrated phrases of his: musing upon one of the many disastrous losses of his armies, he is reported to have said &quot;I gave them everything they asked for – weapons, trucks, whatever they wanted; the one and only thing I could not give them was brains.&quot; He is also supposed to have remarked dryly to Peñaranda, upon the encirclement of the house where he was staying at Villamontes during the coup: &quot;Congratulations General; you just completed your first and only successful military siege of the entire war.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Salamanca married the poet Sara Ugarte de Salamanca and they had five children: Laura, Raquel, Leonor, Hernan, and Rafael. His daughters Leonor and Raquel founded the Sociedad Patriótica de Señoras during the Chaco War. 

Salamanca came from a wealthy, landed family from Cochabamba. At the time of expropriation in 1941, the Salamanca family owned the Chapisirca Lakes; Daniel Salamanca had inherited the lakes, the adjoining Chapisirca ranch, and the Montesillo hacienda from his father Jorge in 1904. From his mother Manuela, he inherited shares in the Colón beer factory, and rights to the Marquina Lakes in 1928. Under the 1906 Bolivian water laws, Salamanca inherited these water sources as accessories to his landed properties.

<text>Woodstock is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The city has a population of 46,705 according to the 2021 Canadian census. Woodstock is the seat of Oxford County, at the head of the Thames River, approximately 128 km from Toronto, and 43 km from London, Ontario. The city is known as the Dairy Capital of Canada and promotes itself as &quot;The Friendly City&quot;.

Woodstock was first settled by European colonists and United Empire Loyalists in 1800, starting with Zacharias Burtch and Levi Luddington, and was incorporated as a town in 1851. Since then, Woodstock has maintained steady growth, and is now a small city in Southwestern Ontario. As a small historic city, Woodstock is one of the few cities in Ontario to still have all of its original administration buildings. The city has developed a strong economic focus towards manufacturing and tourism. It is also a market city for the surrounding agricultural industry.

Woodstock is home to a campus of Fanshawe College. The city plays host to a number of cultural and artistic exhibits, including the Woodstock Museum, a national historic site. Woodstock&#x27;s summer festivals contribute to its tourism industry; however, its economic activity is centred on the manufacturing centre, the city being home to several auto-manufacturing factories. The city&#x27;s west end has exceptionally well-preserved Victorian streetscapes; most notable of these streets is Vansittart Avenue, named after Admiral Henry Vansittart, one of the city&#x27;s first settlers. Woodstock has a large community centre with a rink capable of accommodating 1,800 spectators for hockey games. The centre also has a large banquet hall and atrium which play host to many social gatherings for the community.

==History==
The community was first settled in 1800 after it was determined by Sir John Graves Simcoe, governor of what was then known as Upper Canada, that the area would make a good townsite. The early settlers were generally American immigrants from New York state, such as Levi Burtch and Dr. Levi Hoyt Perry.

Increased immigration from Great Britain followed in the 1820s and 1830s, including the half pay officers Henry Vansittart and Andrew Drew. Admiral Vansittart commissioned Col. Andrew Drew to build a church (Old St. Paul&#x27;s) in a new area of Oxford that was known as the &quot;Town Plot&quot;. The men would later quarrel, which would lead to the construction of a second church known as &quot;New St. Paul&#x27;s&quot;.

In 1836 there were 200 people living in Woodstock, and by 1846 the population had grown to almost 1100 inhabitants. There were six churches or chapels, a jail, a court house, one bank agency, a school and two weekly newspapers. Several court and government offices were located here. Industry included two grist mills, a saw mill, a fulling mill, a brewery and a distillery and four wagon makers.

Woodstock was incorporated as a town in 1851 and had its first town meeting in the Royal Pavilion Hotel. This year also saw the start of the Town Hall and local government.

In 1901, Woodstock, with a population of nearly 9,000, petitioned the provincial legislature for city status and the &quot;Town of Woodstock&quot; was incorporated into the &quot;City of Woodstock&quot;.

From 1900 to 1920, an electric streetcar ran down the streets of Woodstock; as well, after 1920, bricks were used to pave the main street of Woodstock. The bricks were later removed in the 1940s.

==Historical events==

===Mowat&#x27;s provincial premiership===
Sir Oliver Mowat, a native of Kingston, Ontario, served as member of the provincial parliament for the region from 1872 to 1896, during which time he was also premier of the province of Ontario.

===1890 Birchall Trial===
The 1890 Trial began with the arrest of Reginald Birchall in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Birchall was held at the Woodstock jail for seven months until his murder trial began in September of that year. The trial took place at the Woodstock Town Hall as the Court House was under construction at the time. The trial received worldwide media coverage, with reporters camped out across from the Town Hall in the Oxford Hotel.

===1979 tornado===

On August 7, 1979, the Woodstock area was hit by three tornadoes, two of which were rated F4 on the Fujita scale.

==Climate==
==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Woodstock had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

According to the 2016 Canadian Census, approximately 78.2% of residents were European Canadians, whereas 5.3% were visible minorities and 2.2% were aboriginal (including 1.4% First Nations). The largest visible minority group was Black Canadian with 1.6% of the population. No other visible minority makes up more than 1% of the population. The median household income was $68,213 as of 2016.

==Government==
The city government, Woodstock City Council, consists of four city councillors, two city and county councillors, and the mayor who serves as the Head of Council. The current mayor, Jerry Acchione, was elected as mayor on Oct. 24, 2022 after serving two terms as a city councillor. 

Woodstock is the seat of Oxford County, with the County Administration Building located across from City Hall in the area of Dundas and Reeve Streets. The city is governed by both the city and Oxford county councils, each with specific &quot;spheres of jurisdiction&quot;. During 2005, economic development services, then exclusive to the county, was negotiated away from them by former mayor Michael Harding.

For provincial and federal elections, Woodstock is included in the riding of Oxford. Currently, the MP of Oxford is Arpan Khanna (Conservative), and the MPP is Ernie Hardeman (Progressive Conservative).

==Healthcare==

Woodstock General Hospital was located on Riddell Street in central Woodstock for over a century. In the fall of 2011, the WGH moved to a new location in a newly developing area in the southern end of Woodstock. Through millions of dollars in local private donations, backed by government grants, the city now has a new state-of-the-art medical facility. The new hospital is close to highway 401, the busiest highway in North America, and has many upgrades including a helipad and an MRI/cancer centre. It caters to a population of about 55,000 people. It has a workforce of nearly 600 people and 270 volunteers.

Woodstock was the former home of the Oxford Regional Centre. Opened in 1906 as the Hospital for Epileptics, it was later renamed the Ontario Hospital in 1919. Originally on the west side of Highway 59, the hospital then expanded on the east side in the 1950s and transformed into a house for mentally disabled individuals. At its peak, the centre employed 1,500 people. It closed in 1996, and since then all buildings have been demolished except for part of the powerhouse, now the Brickhouse Brewpub - part of the Upper Thames Brewing Company, and the mess hall which has been converted into a community centre for Sally Creek. As well a carved insert with the words &quot;Ontario Hospital&quot; remains in the stone wall on the west side of Highway 59 north of Fairway Road. A polished black granite memorial to the institution sits at Dr. J. J. Williams Park on Lakeview Drive east of Highway 59.

Woodstock also has a variety of Provincial IHF Facilities and Specialists including Large outpatient Cardiology Centre KMH, which houses Cardiologists and Internal Medicine Specialists offering Cardiology Testing such as Echocardiograms, SPECT nuclear medicine, and Holter monitors.

==Sister cities==
Woodstock has two sister cities: Sylvania, Ohio, United States, and Pesche, Italy.

==Downtown==
Downtown Woodstock stretches from Vansittart Avenue to Huron Street on Dundas Street, the city&#x27;s main street. It houses the city&#x27;s banks, administration buildings, independent retailers and several restaurants. The majority of buildings are a century old. Downtown promotes itself through its Business Improvement Area members as a place to shop, work, play and dine. Although there are a few vacancies in the city centre, the downtown is full of beautiful historic buildings and several unique retail outlets. In the 1990s the city undertook an extensive makeover of the main street, adding many gardens and cobbled sidewalks. Every summer the main street is shut down for the city&#x27;s &quot;Summer Streetfest&quot; celebrations, a mix of retail sales and various entertainment.

==Historical landmarks==

===The Town Hall===
The Old Town Hall, now the Woodstock Museum, NHS was built in 1853 and modelled architecturally on the Town Hall in Woodstock, England. Designed by Peter Craib, the Town Hall was built by David White, W.P. Dixon and William McKay. It is majestic for its size, with semi-circular windows and a domed cupola. It served as the first market, first fire hall, community hall, and lockup for the town, and was the location of the world-famous Birchall-Benwell murder trial in 1890. Canada&#x27;s first elected female mayor of a City, Bernadette Smith, served here from 1952 to 1965, and the original town council chamber used from 1871 to 1968 inside has been restored. (Start, Turner, Gardhouse, Bennett, &quot;Historic Buildings of Woostock, Ontario&quot;)

===The Market Building===

The Woodstock Market was built in 1895 by the architect W.B. Ford, using 140,000 feet of lumber, tons of nails, and miles of putty on a site previously occupied by wooden market sheds. The low roof and wide canopies are typical of market construction in this period, and interesting features included the twin towers, the drinking fountain at the front door, and the use of stone in the trim. (Start, Turner, Gardhouse, Bennett, &quot;Historic Public Buildings of Woodstock, Ontario&quot;)

===Woodstock Jail/Gaol===

The old jail was built in 1854 by Hamilton architects Clark and Murray in the Italianate style, with many arches, and an octagonal -storey tower; in this case, the architecture camouflages the function of the institution. Four men and one woman were hanged in the yard, including the infamous Birchall, who posing as &quot;Lord Somerset&quot; duped the entire town and murdered his gentlemen farmer apprentice; this was Victorian Canada&#x27;s most sensational murder case. The death mask at the entrance is of blind Thomas Cook, hanged in 1862 for murdering his wife; his head rolled into the crowd, and afterwards public hangings were discontinued. The building was recently restored by Carlos Ventin of The Ventin Group architects of Simcoe, after a decade of lobbying by the &quot;Save the Jail&quot; Committee, with spectacular results, and is now occupied by Oxford County Public Health.(Start, Turner, Gardhouse, Bennett, &quot;Historic Public Buildings of Woodstock, Ontario&quot;)

===Woodstock Public Library===

The Woodstock Public Library was built in 1909 by Chadwick and Beckett of Toronto on a Carnegie library grant, and it is considered one of the most attractive Carnegie libraries in Ontario. It is in classical revival style, with a graceful entrance, bi-chromatic brickwork, and well-balanced windows; the rotunda inside is beautifully proportioned and dramatic. The library traces its history back to a reading society formed in 1835 with Rev. William Bettridge of Old St. Paul&#x27;s Church as president, and possesses the only complete set of minute books in the province dating back to 1835.
Start, Turner, Gardhouse, Bennett, &quot;Historic Public Buildings of Woodstock, Ontario&quot;

===Oxford County Court House===

Built in 1892 to replace a Regency predecessor of 1839, the Courthouse is a massive building of sandstone in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, with a complex roof line. The first architect was dismissed in 1890 after the walls were found to be faulty, and replaced by Cuthbertson of Woodstock and Fowler of Toronto. Monkey heads are hidden among the capitals of the red marble pillars at the two front entrances, and the monkey at the peak is said to have been carved by the contractor to represent the county council after a dispute over payment.

===City Hall/Old Post Office===

The current City Hall was originally built in 1901 as a post office during the term of Alexander McClenaghan, postmaster for thirty years. Bourgue DesRivieres of Ottawa were the architects and William Hall Burns, a prominent Ottawa sculptor of the Library of Parliament, was commissioned to do the exterior stone carving. Built of warm sandstone, with decorative trim in the gables and a bold corner tower with four clocks, it was converted to municipal offices in 1968.
Start, Turner, Gardhouse, Bennett, &quot;Historic Public Buildings of Woodstock, Ontario&quot;

===Old Fire Hall===

The Perry Street firehall was built in 1899 at a cost of $7,500 to house the horse-drawn wagons. On Saturday evenings, people would gather to see the horses rush out of their stalls at the sound of the regular 9 o&#x27;clock bell, race around the building and back themselves into the shafts ready to be harnessed by firefighters as they slid down the pole from their upstairs quarters. The firehall features a square tower with detailed brickwork at the top, and a miniature tower to the right. The tower bell used to ring for fires, curfews, and lost children, and is now mounted in Southside Park.
(Start, Turner, Gardhouse, Bennett, &quot;Historic Public Buildings of Woodstock, Ontario&quot;)

===Woodstock Armoury===

The old Armouries was erected in 1904 by Nagle and Mills of Ingersoll as the home of the Oxford Rifles until 1954. The crenelated towers give it an appearance of heavy fortification, and its architecture reveals function through its exterior form, making interesting use of stone and brick. In 1971, after being declared surplus to Department of National Defence needs, it was transformed into offices for the Oxford County Board of Education, at which times its two wrought-iron spiral staircases (valued at $3000) were sold at public auction for $250 apiece.

A stone cairn made with stones from the beach of Dieppe, where members of the Battalion participated in The Battle of Dieppe in August 1942, accounts the history of the Oxford Rifles.

===Woodstock Via Station===

The Grand Trunk Railway owned and operated the Woodstock trains in 1914. They would later go bankrupt and be bought out by CN. Via now resides in the heritage building once occupied by Grand Trunk.

===Pattulo&#x27;s Fountain===

This fountain sits in front of The Woodstock Museum or Old Town Hall. The fountain was erected in 1916 in honour of Andrew Pattulo, who was head of the Sentinel-Review newspaper in the early twentieth century.

===Old Registry Building===

The Old Registry Office, now housing Oxford County Social Services, was constructed in 1876 to replace an earlier building on the County Square&#x27;s opposite front corner, and served as a registry office until 1952. Italianate in style like the old jail, it is highlighted by semi-circular masonry over the windows carried out in the arch over the door. Its walls are two feet thick and its roof is said to be filled with sand, making the structure fireproof, and conforming to design plans common to registry offices of that era in Ontario.
Start, Turner, Gardhouse, Bennett, &quot;Historic Public Buildings of Woodstock, Ontario&quot;
Plaques: The first Registry office built in Oxford County was located west of here at the corner of Hunter and Light Streets, Woodstock, 1847. This building, the second Registry Office, was constructed in 1876 and remained in use until 1952. Five registrars of deeds served Oxford in their private homes and in these offices: Capt. Thomas Horner (1800–1834), James Ingersoll (1834–1886), George Patullo (1186–1922), Wallace L. MacWhinnie (1922–1950), and Ross V. Tuck (1950–1969).

===Oxford Hotel===

The Oxford Hotel, located across from Market Square and the Town Hall in Woodstock, was built in 1880 as &quot;The O&#x27;Neill House&quot;. It saw guests such as Oscar Wilde and Reginald Birchall, and later had a double purpose – it was the meeting spot for media in Birchall&#x27;s trial. In 1895, the hotel saw a new owner, who named it &quot;Oxford&quot; and it would change hands twice more in the twentieth century.
The Oxford Hotel also booked some interesting acts. In 1924, the &quot;Human Fly&quot;, who was then all the rage across Canada and the United States, walked across the walls of Oxford&#x27;s Hotel. (SR, July 21, 1924)
The Hotel sits empty now and is available for purchase. There is a historical plaque on the building, recognizing its contributions to local history.

===Captain Andrew Drew House===
735 Rathbourne Ave. Built in 1833. Drew divided the eastern section of the town into town lots and formed the nucleus of this community. A plaque for Captain Andrew Drew, R.N., 1792–1878. Co-founder of Woodstock with Henry Vansittart. He led the loyalist forces, which destroyed the American steamer Caroline during the 1837 Rebellion.

===Hawkin&#x27;s Chapel===
North of Park Row, west of Mill St. A movement to build a church for black people resulted in its construction in 1888. The church closed in 1985 when it was sold for a house.

===Hugh Richardson House===
419 Vincent St. Neo-classical style house built in 1849. The first owner, Hugh Richardson, was the presiding judge at the Louis Riel trial in 1885. Richardson was also the first reeve of Woodstock.

===James Hay Residence===
An Italianate-style home built in 1878. There is a lamp post from the Vansittart farm on the property. A plaque for James Hay, a well-known industrialist born in Woodstock, who was one of the founders of the Board of Trade in 1878, elected to Town Council in 1880 and Mayor between 1893 and 1894.

===Perry-Hill Home; &quot;House of the Valley&quot;===
130 Finkle St. It is the oldest house in Woodstock, built in 1819 by Dr. Perry, the first doctor and teacher in Woodstock.

===T.L. &quot;Carbide&quot; Willson House===
210 Vansittart Ave, Woodstock ON, N4S 6E9, CANADA. The home was built in 1895 by Thomas &quot;Carbide&quot; Willson, inventor of the first commercial calcium-carbide process for the manufacturer of acetylene gas. It was the residence of the Sisters of St. Joseph&#x27;s until 1975. It&#x27;s now a Guest House/B&amp;B named Château la Motte (www.chateaulamotte.ca) owned by Alida and François Joubert. They are from South Africa, but François&#x27; family comes from the south of France (hence La Motte-d&#x27;Aiques, Provence).

===Kyrtleglen House===
145 Delatre Street, built in 1846, was originally owned and built by Malcolm Douglas. Malcolm married Christina Hay of the James Hay family. Douglas was the owner of the local tannery. His son built a twin of the house in town to a smaller scale. Douglas street is named after him.

==Sports and recreation==

Woodstock has several parks and gardens. Most notable is Southside Park, which has a playground, baseball diamonds, public washrooms, soccer fields, gardens, and a new Skatepark. It also has a large pond, and many walking trails. Tip O&#x27;Neill Field at Southside Park is home for the Woodstock Rangers OBA Junior baseball team.

At the North End of the city is Roth Park and the Gordon Pittock Conservation Area, which stretch along the shores Gordon Pittock Reservoir, an artificial lake created by the construction of the Pittock Dam. This park contains a playground and several kilometers of walking, running, and biking trails.

The Woodstock Dragon Boat Club also uses the Gordon Pittock Reservoir as their home. They are a growing dragon boat community consisting of both adult and junior teams.

Woodstock has two ice rinks, two at the Community Complex at the south end of the city, and one at the fairgrounds in the central region. Southwood Arena at the Community Complex is home for the Woodstock Navy-Vets OHA Junior hockey team.

Woodstock also has a roller derby team called the Woodstock Warriors. Woodstock roller derby was founded in 2011.

The Woodstock Soccer Club constructed an indoor turf field house and outdoor soccer park in the northwestern corner of the city, at the former site of the Oxford Regional Centre. The City now owns this facility, known as Cowan Park. The city has one indoor swimming pool, Southside Aquatic Centre, and the local YMCA and Lions Pools closed.

The city&#x27;s Craigowan (Oxford) Golf Club, a private facility, dates from 1909, on a different site from that used by the current course. It has hosted provincial championships, and in 2014 staged the Canadian Women&#x27;s Amateur Championship.

Present annual maintenance costs are about $40,000.

The Pittock Dam is designed for both flood control and flow augmentation purposes. It is designed to benefit water quality downstream during dry summer conditions and provide year-round flood control capability to protect downstream communities.

==Industry==

===Toyota plant===

In June 2005, Toyota announced plans to build a new, $1.1 billion CAD automobile assembly plant in Woodstock on a undeveloped site in the city&#x27;s northeast end. The plant was expected to employ 2000 people and begin full production of the Toyota RAV4 SUV in November 2008, at the rate of 150,000 a year. However, because of slowing car sales and bleeding market share to South Korean marques, Toyota cut production by 50% to 75,000 a year and reduced the work force 40% to 1,200 people. The other 800 workers are expected to be recalled when (if ever) car sales increase. It was the first new auto assembly plant to be built in Canada in two decades.

In January 2010 the second shift was added and production increased to 150,000 units per year. In 2012 they began production of the all-electric RAV4 EV in conjunction with Tesla motors. In 2013, the combined production of the RAV4 and RAV4 EV will increase to 200,000 units per year and an additional 400 workers well be added. This will bring the total work force at the Woodstock facility to 2,400.

===Hino Motors Canada Ltd.===
In early March 2006, Hino Motors, a Toyota Motor Co. subsidiary, announced that it will be the first Japanese truck manufacturer to build its vehicles in Canada with a new Woodstock plant slated to begin production in April 2006, in the former General Seating plant in the Pattullo Ridge Business Park near Highway 401 and Highway 59.

The $3 million, plant will employ 45 and assemble 2,000 trucks a year when it begins production.

In late November 2008 the Hino Motors automotive plant was completed.

<doc id="221703" wikidata="Q7274285" url="?curid=221703" title="R v Oakes">
<text>R v Oakes [1986] 1 SCR 103 is a Supreme Court of Canada decision that established the legal test for whether a government action infringing a right under the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; is justified. David Oakes challenged the validity of provisions under the &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot; that provided a person found in possession of a narcotic, absent of evidence to the contrary, must be convicted of trafficking the narcotic. Oakes contended the presumption of trafficking violated the presumption of innocence guarantee under section 11(d) of the Charter.

The Supreme Court established the &quot;Oakes&quot; test as an analysis of the limitations clause (section 1) of the &quot;Charter&quot; that allows reasonable limitations on rights and freedoms through legislation if the limitation is motivated by a &quot;pressing and substantial objective&quot; and can be &quot;demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.&quot;

== Background == 

On December 17, 1981, David Edwin Oakes was arrested in London, Ontario, and charged with possession of eight one gram vials of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking, a narcotic under section 4(2) of the &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot;. Oakes was also found with CA$619.45 () in cash, afterwards he told police he had purchased ten one gram vials of hashish oil for $150 for personal use and the money was from a workers&#x27; compensation cheque.

=== &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot; ===
In 1961, the Parliament of Canada passed the &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot;, a new legislative framework for the control of narcotics in Canada. The new act replaced the &quot;Opium and Narcotic Drug Act&quot; while providing an offence for illegal importing or exporting of narcotics, and increased penalties for convictions. The new &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot; carried forward reverse onus provisions for possession introduced first introduced in 1911, and further expanded through the 1920s. Parliament expanded reverse onus provisions in 1954 to facilitate convictions for possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking.

Section 4 of the &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot; provided the provisions and penalties for trafficking narcotics.

Section 8 of the &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot; provided that if the court finds the accused in possession of a narcotic, the accused is presumed to be in possession for the purpose of trafficking and that, absent the accused&#x27;s establishing the contrary, he must be convicted of trafficking. 

Oakes&#x27; Charter challenge claimed that the reverse onus created by the presumption of possession for purposes of trafficking violated the presumption of innocence guarantee under section 11(d) of the Charter. The issues before the court were whether section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act violated section 11(d) of the Charter and whether any violation of section 11(d) could be upheld under section 1.

=== Prior cases ===
The reverse onus provisions of the &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot; regarding trafficking had been previously challenged through the courts in Canada. The Ontario Court of Appeals considered the reverse onus provisions in the wake of Parliament passing the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; which included section 2(f) and the presumption of innocence, in 1960. In &quot;R v. Sharp&quot; (1961), 131 C.C.C. 75, Justice Kenneth Gibson Morden of the Ontario Court of Appeal found the reverse onus provisions did not deprive the accused of the presumption of innocence, as the accused had the secondary burden of adducing evidence, and the primary onus remained with the Crown.

Following the introduction of the &quot;Charter&quot; two Section 11 challenges to the reverse onus trafficking provisions of the &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot; were heard. In the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench, &quot;R. v. Fraser&quot; (1982) 68 CCC (2d) 433, found that the reasonable limit provisions of section 1 of the &quot;Charter&quot; protected the provisions. In &quot;R. v. Therrien&quot; 1982 CanLII 3832, heard in the Ontario Court of Justice, the court relied on the 1961 ruling in &quot;R v Sharp&quot; and did not strike down section 8 of the &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot;.

== Court&#x27;s reasons ==
The court was unanimous in holding that the shift in onus violated both Oakes&#x27; section 11(d) rights and indirectly his section 7 rights, and could not be justified under section 1 of the &quot;Charter&quot;. This was because there was no rational connection between basic possession and the presumption of trafficking, and therefore the shift in onus is not related to the previous challenge to section 11(d) of the &quot;Charter&quot;.

The court described the exceptional criteria under which rights could be justifiably limited under section 1. The court identified two main functions of section 1. First, &quot;it guarantees the rights which follow it&quot;, and secondly, it &quot;states the criteria against which justifications for limitations on those rights must be measured&quot;.

The key values of the &quot;Charter&quot; come from the phrase &quot;free and democratic society&quot; and should be used as the &quot;ultimate standard&quot; for interpretation of section 1. These include values such as:
:&quot;respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in social and political institutions which enhance the participation of individuals and groups in society.&quot;

&quot;Charter&quot; rights are not absolute and it is necessary to limit them in order to achieve &quot;collective goals of fundamental importance&quot;.

The court presents a two-step test to justify a limitation based on the analysis in &quot;R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd&quot;. First, the limitation must be motivated by &quot;an objective related to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society&quot;, and second it must be shown &quot;that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified&quot;.

The second part is described as a &quot;proportionality test&quot; which requires the invoking party to show:
* &quot;First, the measures adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They must not be arbitrary, unfair, or based on irrational considerations. In short, they must be rationally connected to the objective;&quot; 
* &quot;Second, the means, even if rationally connected to the objective in this first sense, should impair &quot;as little as possible&quot; the right or freedom in question;&quot; 
* &quot;Third, there must be a proportionality between the effects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom, and the objective which has been identified as of &quot;sufficient importance&quot;.&quot;

In applying this test to the facts, the court found that section 8 did not pass the rational connection test because the &quot;possession of a small or negligible quantity of narcotics does not support the inference of trafficking … it would be irrational to infer that a person had an intent to traffic on the basis of his or her possession of a very small quantity of narcotics&quot;. Therefore, section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act was held to be in violation of the &quot;Charter&quot; and therefore of no force or effect.

<text>Stratford is a city on the Avon River within Perth County in southwestern Ontario, Canada, with a 2021 population of 33,232 in a land area of . Stratford is the seat of Perth County, which was settled by English, Irish, Scottish and German immigrants, in almost equal numbers, starting in the 1820s but primarily in the 1830s and 1840s. Most became farmers; even today, the area around Stratford is known for mixed farming, dairying and hog production.

The area was settled by Europeans in 1832, and the town and river were named after Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Stratford was incorporated as a town in 1859 and as a city in 1886. The first mayor was John Corry Wilson Daly. The swan has become a symbol of the city. Each year, twenty-four white swans are released into the Avon River. The town is noted for the Stratford Festival, which performs Shakespearean plays and other genres from May to October.

== History ==
In 1832, the development of an area called &quot;Little Thames&quot; as the market centre for the eastern Huron Tract began. By 1834 a tavern, sawmill and grist mill had opened, and by 1835 a post office, called Stratford, was operating. The &quot;Smith&#x27;s Canadian Gazetteer&quot; of 1846 describes Stratford as follows: &quot;Stratford contains about 200 inhabitants. Post Office, post three times a-week. Professions and Trades.—Two physicians and surgeons, one grist and saw mill, one tannery, three stores, one brewery, one distillery, one ashery, two taverns, two blacksmiths, one saddler, two wheelwrights, three shoemakers, two
tailors. Settlement was slow until the early 1850s when the railway arrived.

Furniture manufacturing and railway locomotive repairs were the most important parts of the local economy by the twentieth century. In 1933 a general strike, started by the furniture workers and led by the Communist Workers&#x27; Unity League, marked the last time the army was deployed to break a strike in Canada. The Grand Trunk Railway (later CNR) locomotive repair shops were the major employer for many years, employing 40% of the population.

The city is in a successful agricultural area and has some auto parts manufacturing, but tourism is still the most significant aspect. According to an estimate by the Conference Board of Canada, it generates $140 million in economic activity, $65 million in taxes and 3,000 direct and indirect jobs. For the past few years however, the town has been working to attract more technical industries with former Mayor Dan Mathieson spearheading the effort. The Royal Bank of Canada opened a $300 million data centre here, Starwood Hotels is experimenting with a new type of call centre, and the University of Waterloo has opened a satellite campus with about 500 students specializing in digital media and information technology, and as the home of the technology forum Canada 3.0 and various technology companies.

==Arts and culture==
=== Stratford Festival ===

The Stratford Shakespeare Festival began in 1953 when, on July 13, actor Alec Guinness spoke the first lines of the first play produced by the festival.

The performances during the first four seasons took place in a concrete amphitheatre covered by giant canvas tent on the banks of the River Avon. The first of many years of Stratford Shakespeare Festival production history started with a six-week season, opening on 13 July 1953, with &quot;Richard III&quot; and then &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; both starring Alec Guinness. The 1954 season ran for nine weeks and included Sophocles&#x27; Oedipus Rex and two Shakespeare plays, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. Young actors during the first four seasons included several who went on to great success in subsequent years, Douglas Campbell, Timothy Findley, Don Harron, William Hutt and Douglas Rain.
The new Festival Theatre was dedicated on 30 June 1957, with seating for over 1,800 people; none are more than 65 feet from the thrust stage. Over the years, additional theatrical venues were added: the Avon Theatre, the Tom Patterson Theatre (originally Shakespeare 3 Company) and the Studio Theatre. The annual festival now draws hundreds of thousands of theatre goers and tourists to the area each year. Acclaimed actors including Alec Guinness, Christopher Plummer, Dame Maggie Smith, William Hutt, Martha Henry and William Shatner have performed at the festival. The Canadian novelist and playwright Timothy Findley performed in the first season, and had an ongoing relationship with the festival, eventually moving to Stratford in 1997.

From 1956 to 1961 and 1971 to 1976, the Stratford Festival also staged the separate Stratford Film Festival, which was credited as one of the first North American film festivals ever to schedule international films. That festival collapsed after the 1976 launch of the Festival of Festivals, now known as the Toronto International Film Festival, impacted both the Stratford Film Festival&#x27;s funding and its audience.

=== Music ===
The Stratford Summer Music Festival has been held for seven seasons and features indoor and outdoor performances by international, classical, and world music artists as well as young Canadian performers around downtown Stratford.

The Stratford Concert Band, a local wind ensemble, was founded as the Grand Trunk Railway Employees Band, and renamed the Canadian National Railway Employees&#x27; Band in 1907. The band performs free outdoor concerts at the Kiwanis Pavilion Bandshell in Upper Queen&#x27;s Park throughout the summer. 

=== Pride and the 2SLGBTQIA+ Community ===
Stratford is home to year-round 2SLGBTQIA+ programming and events.

Since 2018, Stratford has been home to pride festivities during the month of June (for Pride Month). Planned and implemented by Stratford-Perth Pride, pride month in Stratford typically includes a pride parade, drag show, family-friendly pride in the park event, and flag raisings. In November 2021, Stratford-Perth Pride launched its first annual Trans Pride Week - a week of celebrations honouring the trans and nonbinary community.

Stratford is also home to the Stratford Pride Community Centre (SPCC). The SPCC is a physical space located in downtown Stratford for the 2SLGBTQIA+ community to visit during drop-in hours and attend social events. The SPCC also hosts Stratford&#x27;s Winter Pride event which takes place in February of each year. 

Since 2021, Stratford District Secondary School (SDSS) and Stratford Intermediate School (SIS) has been putting their yearly budget toward including 2SLGBTQIA+ community to help those students feel included.

==Attractions==
Numerous visitors arrive in Stratford each week during the May to October Festival season. &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; considers the theatres to be &quot;nirvana&quot; and also praises other aspects of the town. &quot;During the festival—which stages everything from Shakespeare to Sondheim to new Canadian plays—you can stay in theater-themed B&amp;Bs, hang out with actors post-show at local bars, go on backstage tours, and attend dozens of other events with other theater-mad folk. Stratford itself is the type of walkable wholesome town Rodgers and Hammerstein might write a musical about.&quot;

In addition to the festival, several annual events attract visitors. Stratford Summer Music, in its 17th year, runs for about a month. In 2016, the event, run by the town, offered 85 concerts, a third of them free or &quot;pay what you can&quot;. The 2016 budget was $800,000 with funding provided by agencies such as the Ontario Cultural Attractions Fund. Smaller event are held in other months, including winter and the Swan Weekend in April, to attract off-season visitors.
Fans of Stratford-born musician Justin Bieber frequently visit the town, and Stratford Tourism has produced a &quot;Bieber-iffic Map&quot; showing sites associated with his life in Stratford. In 2018, the Stratford Perth Museum opened &quot;Steps to Stardom,&quot; an exhibit documenting Bieber&#x27;s early career in Stratford. Some town locals are known to refer to Stratford as &quot;the big S&quot;, drawing in fans year after year.

<text>In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is a correlation coefficient that measures linear correlation between two sets of data. It is the ratio between the covariance of two variables and the product of their standard deviations; thus, it is essentially a normalized measurement of the covariance, such that the result always has a value between −1 and 1. As with covariance itself, the measure can only reflect a linear correlation of variables, and ignores many other types of relationships or correlations. As a simple example, one would expect the age and height of a sample of children from a school to have a Pearson correlation coefficient significantly greater than 0, but less than 1 (as 1 would represent an unrealistically perfect correlation).

==Naming and history==
It was developed by Karl Pearson from a related idea introduced by Francis Galton in the 1880s, and for which the mathematical formula was derived and published by Auguste Bravais in 1844. The naming of the coefficient is thus an example of Stigler&#x27;s Law.

==Motivation/Intuition and Derivation==
The correlation coefficient can be derived by considering the cosine of the angle between two points representing the two sets of x and y co-ordinate data. This expression is therefore a number between -1 and 1 and is equal to unity when all the points lie on a straight line.

==Definition==
Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. The form of the definition involves a &quot;product moment&quot;, that is, the mean (the first moment about the origin) of the product of the mean-adjusted random variables; hence the modifier &quot;product-moment&quot; in the name.

===For a population===
Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient, when applied to a population, is commonly represented by the Greek letter &quot;ρ&quot; (rho) and may be referred to as the &quot;population correlation coefficient&quot; or the &quot;population Pearson correlation coefficient&quot;. Given a pair of random variables formula_1 (for example, Height and Weight), the formula for &quot;ρ&quot; is

formula_2

where
*formula_3 is the covariance
*formula_4 is the standard deviation of formula_5
*formula_6 is the standard deviation of formula_7.

The formula for formula_8 can be expressed in terms of mean and expectation. Since

:formula_9

the formula for formula_10 can also be written as

formula_11

where
*formula_6 and formula_4 are defined as above
*formula_14 is the mean of formula_5
*formula_16 is the mean of formula_7
*formula_18 is the expectation.

The formula for formula_10 can be expressed in terms of uncentered moments. Since

:formula_20

the formula for formula_10 can also be written as
formula_22

===For a sample===
Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient, when applied to a sample, is commonly represented by formula_23 and may be referred to as the &quot;sample correlation coefficient&quot; or the &quot;sample Pearson correlation coefficient&quot;. We can obtain a formula for formula_23 by substituting estimates of the covariances and variances based on a sample into the formula above. Given paired data formula_25 consisting of formula_26 pairs, formula_23 is defined as

formula_28

where
*formula_26 is sample size
*formula_30 are the individual sample points indexed with &quot;i&quot;
*formula_31 (the sample mean); and analogously for formula_32.

Rearranging gives us this formula for formula_23:

:formula_34

where formula_35 are defined as above.

Rearranging again gives us this formula for formula_23:

:formula_37

where formula_38 are defined as above.

This formula suggests a convenient single-pass algorithm for calculating sample correlations, though depending on the numbers involved, it can sometimes be numerically unstable.

An equivalent expression gives the formula for formula_23 as the mean of the products of the standard scores as follows:

:formula_40

where
*formula_35 are defined as above, and formula_42 are defined below
*formula_43 is the standard score (and analogously for the standard score of formula_44).

Alternative formulae for formula_23 are also available. For example, one can use the following formula for formula_23:

:formula_47
where
*formula_35 are defined as above and:
*formula_49 (the sample standard deviation); and analogously for formula_50.

=== For jointly gaussian distributions ===
If formula_51 is jointly gaussian, with mean zero and variance formula_52, then formula_53.

===Practical issues===
Under heavy noise conditions, extracting the correlation coefficient between two sets of stochastic variables is nontrivial, in particular where Canonical Correlation Analysis reports degraded correlation values due to the heavy noise contributions. A generalization of the approach is given elsewhere.

In case of missing data, Garren derived the maximum likelihood estimator.

Some distributions (e.g., stable distributions other than a normal distribution) do not have a defined variance.

==Mathematical properties==
The values of both the sample and population Pearson correlation coefficients are on or between −1 and 1. Correlations equal to +1 or −1 correspond to data points lying exactly on a line (in the case of the sample correlation), or to a bivariate distribution entirely supported on a line (in the case of the population correlation). The Pearson correlation coefficient is symmetric: corr(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) = corr(&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;X&quot;).

A key mathematical property of the Pearson correlation coefficient is that it is invariant under separate changes in location and scale in the two variables. That is, we may transform &quot;X&quot; to and transform &quot;Y&quot; to , where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; are constants with , without changing the correlation coefficient. (This holds for both the population and sample Pearson correlation coefficients.) More general linear transformations do change the correlation: see &quot;&quot; for an application of this.

==Interpretation==
The correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to 1. An absolute value of exactly 1 implies that a linear equation describes the relationship between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; perfectly, with all data points lying on a line. The correlation sign is determined by the regression slope: a value of +1 implies that all data points lie on a line for which &quot;Y&quot; increases as &quot;X&quot; increases, whereas a value of -1 implies a line where &quot;Y&quot; increases while &quot;X&quot; decreases. A value of 0 implies that there is no linear dependency between the variables.

More generally, is positive if and only if &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; lie on the same side of their respective means. Thus the correlation coefficient is positive if &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; tend to be simultaneously greater than, or simultaneously less than, their respective means. The correlation coefficient is negative (anti-correlation) if &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; tend to lie on opposite sides of their respective means. Moreover, the stronger either tendency is, the larger is the absolute value of the correlation coefficient.

Rodgers and Nicewander cataloged thirteen ways of interpreting correlation or simple functions of it:
* Function of raw scores and means
* Standardized covariance
* Standardized slope of the regression line
* Geometric mean of the two regression slopes
* Square root of the ratio of two variances
* Mean cross-product of standardized variables
* Function of the angle between two standardized regression lines
* Function of the angle between two variable vectors
* Rescaled variance of the difference between standardized scores
* Estimated from the balloon rule
* Related to the bivariate ellipses of isoconcentration
* Function of test statistics from designed experiments
* Ratio of two means

===Geometric interpretation===
For uncentered data, there is a relation between the correlation coefficient and the angle &quot;φ&quot; between the two regression lines, and , obtained by regressing &quot;y&quot; on &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&quot; on &quot;y&quot; respectively. (Here, &quot;φ&quot; is measured counterclockwise within the first quadrant formed around the lines&#x27; intersection point if , or counterclockwise from the fourth to the second quadrant if .) One can show that if the standard deviations are equal, then , where sec and tan are trigonometric functions.

For centered data (i.e., data which have been shifted by the sample means of their respective variables so as to have an average of zero for each variable), the correlation coefficient can also be viewed as the cosine of the angle &quot;θ&quot; between the two observed vectors in &quot;N&quot;-dimensional space (for &quot;N&quot; observations of each variable).

Both the uncentered (non-Pearson-compliant) and centered correlation coefficients can be determined for a dataset. As an example, suppose five countries are found to have gross national products of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 billion dollars, respectively. Suppose these same five countries (in the same order) are found to have 11%, 12%, 13%, 15%, and 18% poverty. Then let x and y be ordered 5-element vectors containing the above data: and .

By the usual procedure for finding the angle &quot;θ&quot; between two vectors (see dot product), the &quot;uncentered&quot; correlation coefficient is

:formula_54

This uncentered correlation coefficient is identical with the cosine similarity. The above data were deliberately chosen to be perfectly correlated: . The Pearson correlation coefficient must therefore be exactly one. Centering the data (shifting x by and y by ) yields and , from which

:formula_55
as expected.

===Interpretation of the size of a correlation===
Several authors have offered guidelines for the interpretation of a correlation coefficient. However, all such criteria are in some ways arbitrary. The interpretation of a correlation coefficient depends on the context and purposes. A correlation of 0.8 may be very low if one is verifying a physical law using high-quality instruments, but may be regarded as very high in the social sciences, where there may be a greater contribution from complicating factors.

==Inference==
Statistical inference based on Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient often focuses on one of the following two aims:
* One aim is to test the null hypothesis that the true correlation coefficient &quot;ρ&quot; is equal to 0, based on the value of the sample correlation coefficient &quot;r&quot;.
* The other aim is to derive a confidence interval that, on repeated sampling, has a given probability of containing &quot;ρ&quot;.
Methods of achieving one or both of these aims are discussed below.

===Using a permutation test===
Permutation tests provide a direct approach to performing hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals. A permutation test for Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient involves the following two steps: 
# Using the original paired data (&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;), randomly redefine the pairs to create a new data set (&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&#x27;), where the &#x27; are a permutation of the set {1...,&quot;n&quot;}. The permutation &#x27; is selected randomly, with equal probabilities placed on all &quot;n&quot;! possible permutations. This is equivalent to drawing the &#x27; randomly without replacement from the set {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;}. In bootstrapping, a closely related approach, the &quot;i&quot; and the &quot;&quot; are equal and drawn with replacement from {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;};
# Construct a correlation coefficient &quot;r&quot; from the randomized data.
To perform the permutation test, repeat steps (1) and (2) a large number of times. The p-value for the permutation test is the proportion of the &quot;r&quot; values generated in step (2) that are larger than the Pearson correlation coefficient that was calculated from the original data. Here &quot;larger&quot; can mean either that the value is larger in magnitude, or larger in signed value, depending on whether a two-sided or one-sided test is desired.

===Using a bootstrap===
The bootstrap can be used to construct confidence intervals for Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient. In the &quot;non-parametric&quot; bootstrap, &quot;n&quot; pairs (&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;) are resampled &quot;with replacement&quot; from the observed set of &quot;n&quot; pairs, and the correlation coefficient &quot;r&quot; is calculated based on the resampled data. This process is repeated a large number of times, and the empirical distribution of the resampled &quot;r&quot; values are used to approximate the sampling distribution of the statistic. A 95% confidence interval for &quot;ρ&quot; can be defined as the interval spanning from the 2.5th to the 97.5th percentile of the resampled &quot;r&quot; values.

=== Standard error ===
If formula_56 and formula_44 are random variables, with a simple linear relationship between them with an additive normal noise (i.e., y= a + bx + e), then a standard error associated to the correlation is

:formula_58

where formula_59 is the correlation and formula_26 the sample size.

===Testing using Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution===
For pairs from an uncorrelated bivariate normal distribution, the sampling distribution of the studentized Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient follows Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution with degrees of freedom &quot;n&quot; − 2. Specifically, if the underlying variables have a bivariate normal distribution, the variable

:formula_61

has a student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution in the null case (zero correlation). This holds approximately in case of non-normal observed values if sample sizes are large enough. For determining the critical values for &quot;r&quot; the inverse function is needed:

:formula_62

Alternatively, large sample, asymptotic approaches can be used.

Another early paper provides graphs and tables for general values of &quot;ρ&quot;, for small sample sizes, and discusses computational approaches.

In the case where the underlying variables are not normal, the sampling distribution of Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient follows a Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution, but the degrees of freedom are reduced.

===Using the exact distribution===
For data that follow a bivariate normal distribution, the exact density function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) for the sample correlation coefficient &quot;r&quot; of a normal bivariate is

:formula_63

where formula_64 is the gamma function and formula_65 is the Gaussian hypergeometric function.

In the special case when formula_66 (zero population correlation), the exact density function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) can be written as

:formula_67

where formula_68 is the beta function, which is one way of writing the density of a Student&#x27;s t-distribution for a studentized sample correlation coefficient, as above.

===Using the Fisher transformation===
In practice, confidence intervals and hypothesis tests relating to &quot;ρ&quot; are usually carried out using the, Variance-stabilizing transformation, Fisher transformation, formula_69&quot;:

:formula_70

&quot;F&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) approximately follows a normal distribution with

:formula_71and standard error formula_72

where &quot;n&quot; is the sample size. The approximation error is lowest for a large sample size formula_26 and small formula_59 and formula_75 and increases otherwise.

Using the approximation, a z-score is

:formula_76

under the null hypothesis that formula_77, given the assumption that the sample pairs are independent and identically distributed and follow a bivariate normal distribution. Thus an approximate p-value can be obtained from a normal probability table. For example, if &quot;z&quot; = 2.2 is observed and a two-sided p-value is desired to test the null hypothesis that formula_66, the p-value is , where Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.

To obtain a confidence interval for ρ, we first compute a confidence interval for &quot;F&quot;(&quot;formula_10&quot;):

:formula_80

The inverse Fisher transformation brings the interval back to the correlation scale.

:formula_81

For example, suppose we observe &quot;r&quot; = 0.7 with a sample size of &quot;n&quot;=50, and we wish to obtain a 95% confidence interval for &quot;ρ&quot;. The transformed value is formula_82, so the confidence interval on the transformed scale is formula_83, or (0.5814, 1.1532). Converting back to the correlation scale yields (0.5237, 0.8188).

==In least squares regression analysis==

The square of the sample correlation coefficient is typically denoted &quot;r&quot;2 and is a special case of the coefficient of determination. In this case, it estimates the fraction of the variance in &quot;Y&quot; that is explained by &quot;X&quot; in a simple linear regression. So if we have the observed dataset formula_84 and the fitted dataset formula_85 then as a starting point the total variation in the &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; around their average value can be decomposed as follows

:formula_86

where the formula_87 are the fitted values from the regression analysis. This can be rearranged to give

:formula_88

The two summands above are the fraction of variance in &quot;Y&quot; that is explained by &quot;X&quot; (right) and that is unexplained by &quot;X&quot; (left).

Next, we apply a property of least squares regression models, that the sample covariance between formula_87 and formula_90 is zero. Thus, the sample correlation coefficient between the observed and fitted response values in the regression can be written (calculation is under expectation, assumes Gaussian statistics)

:formula_91

Thus

:formula_92

where formula_93 is the proportion of variance in &quot;Y&quot; explained by a linear function of &quot;X&quot;.

In the derivation above, the fact that
:formula_94
can be proved by noticing that the partial derivatives of the residual sum of squares () over &quot;β&quot;0 and &quot;β&quot;1 are equal to 0 in the least squares model, where
:formula_95.

In the end, the equation can be written as

:formula_96
where
*formula_97
*formula_98.
The symbol formula_99 is called the regression sum of squares, also called the explained sum of squares, and formula_100 is the total sum of squares (proportional to the variance of the data).

==Sensitivity to the data distribution==
===Existence===
The population Pearson correlation coefficient is defined in terms of moments, and therefore exists for any bivariate probability distribution for which the population covariance is defined and the marginal population variances are defined and are non-zero. Some probability distributions, such as the Cauchy distribution, have undefined variance and hence ρ is not defined if &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; follows such a distribution. In some practical applications, such as those involving data suspected to follow a heavy-tailed distribution, this is an important consideration. However, the existence of the correlation coefficient is usually not a concern; for instance, if the range of the distribution is bounded, ρ is always defined.

===Sample size===
*If the sample size is moderate or large and the population is normal, then, in the case of the bivariate normal distribution, the sample correlation coefficient is the maximum likelihood estimate of the population correlation coefficient, and is asymptotically unbiased and efficient, which roughly means that it is impossible to construct a more accurate estimate than the sample correlation coefficient. 
*If the sample size is large and the population is not normal, then the sample correlation coefficient remains approximately unbiased, but may not be efficient.
*If the sample size is large, then the sample correlation coefficient is a consistent estimator of the population correlation coefficient as long as the sample means, variances, and covariance are consistent (which is guaranteed when the law of large numbers can be applied).
*If the sample size is small, then the sample correlation coefficient &quot;r&quot; is not an unbiased estimate of &quot;ρ&quot;. The adjusted correlation coefficient must be used instead: see elsewhere in this article for the definition.
*Correlations can be different for imbalanced dichotomous data when there is variance error in sample.

===Robustness===
Like many commonly used statistics, the sample statistic &quot;r&quot; is not robust, so its value can be misleading if outliers are present. Specifically, the PMCC is neither distributionally robust, nor outlier resistant (see &quot;&quot;). Inspection of the scatterplot between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; will typically reveal a situation where lack of robustness might be an issue, and in such cases it may be advisable to use a robust measure of association. Note however that while most robust estimators of association measure statistical dependence in some way, they are generally not interpretable on the same scale as the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Statistical inference for Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient is sensitive to the data distribution. Exact tests, and asymptotic tests based on the Fisher transformation can be applied if the data are approximately normally distributed, but may be misleading otherwise. In some situations, the bootstrap can be applied to construct confidence intervals, and permutation tests can be applied to carry out hypothesis tests. These non-parametric approaches may give more meaningful results in some situations where bivariate normality does not hold. However the standard versions of these approaches rely on exchangeability of the data, meaning that there is no ordering or grouping of the data pairs being analyzed that might affect the behavior of the correlation estimate.

A stratified analysis is one way to either accommodate a lack of bivariate normality, or to isolate the correlation resulting from one factor while controlling for another. If &quot;W&quot; represents cluster membership or another factor that it is desirable to control, we can stratify the data based on the value of &quot;W&quot;, then calculate a correlation coefficient within each stratum. The stratum-level estimates can then be combined to estimate the overall correlation while controlling for &quot;W&quot;.

==Variants==
Variations of the correlation coefficient can be calculated for different purposes. Here are some examples.

===Adjusted correlation coefficient===
The sample correlation coefficient is not an unbiased estimate of . For data that follows a bivariate normal distribution, the expectation for the sample correlation coefficient of a normal bivariate is

:formula_101 therefore is a biased estimator of formula_102

The unique minimum variance unbiased estimator is given by

where:
*formula_103 are defined as above,
*formula_104 is the Gaussian hypergeometric function.

An approximately unbiased estimator can be obtained by truncating and solving this truncated equation:

An approximate solution to equation () is

where in ()
*formula_103 are defined as above,
* is a suboptimal estimator,
* can also be obtained by maximizing log(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;)),
* has minimum variance for large values of ,
* has a bias of order .

Another proposed adjusted correlation coefficient is

:formula_106

 for large values of .

===Weighted correlation coefficient===
Suppose observations to be correlated have differing degrees of importance that can be expressed with a weight vector &quot;w&quot;. To calculate the correlation between vectors &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; with the weight vector &quot;w&quot; (all of length &quot;n&quot;),

* Weighted mean: formula_107
* Weighted covariance formula_108
* Weighted correlation formula_109

===Reflective correlation coefficient===
The reflective correlation is a variant of Pearson&#x27;s correlation in which the data are not centered around their mean values. The population reflective correlation is

:formula_110

The reflective correlation is symmetric, but it is not invariant under translation:

:formula_111

The sample reflective correlation is equivalent to cosine similarity:

:formula_112

The weighted version of the sample reflective correlation is

:formula_113

===Scaled correlation coefficient===
Scaled correlation is a variant of Pearson&#x27;s correlation in which the range of the data is restricted intentionally and in a controlled manner to reveal correlations between fast components in time series. Scaled correlation is defined as average correlation across short segments of data.

Let formula_114 be the number of segments that can fit into the total length of the signal formula_115 for a given scale formula_116:

:formula_117

The scaled correlation across the entire signals formula_118 is then computed as

:formula_119

where formula_120 is Pearson&#x27;s coefficient of correlation for segment formula_121.

By choosing the parameter formula_116, the range of values is reduced and the correlations on long time scale are filtered out, only the correlations on short time scales being revealed. Thus, the contributions of slow components are removed and those of fast components are retained.

===Pearson&#x27;s distance===
A distance metric for two variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; known as &quot;Pearson&#x27;s distance&quot; can be defined from their correlation coefficient as
:formula_123
Considering that the Pearson correlation coefficient falls between [−1, +1], the Pearson distance lies in [0, 2]. The Pearson distance has been used in cluster analysis and data detection for communications and storage with unknown gain and offset.

The Pearson &quot;distance&quot; defined this way assigns distance greater than 1 to negative correlations. In reality, both strong positive correlation and negative correlations are meaningful, so care must be taken when Pearson &quot;distance&quot; is used for nearest neighbor algorithm as such algorithm will only include neighbors with positive correlation and exclude neighbors with negative correlation. Alternatively, an absolute valued distance, formula_124, can be applied, which will take both positive and negative correlations into consideration. The information on positive and negative association can be extracted separately, later.

===Circular correlation coefficient===
For variables &quot;X&quot; = {&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;} and &quot;Y&quot; = {&quot;y&quot;1...,&quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;} that are defined on the unit circle , it is possible to define a circular analog of Pearson&#x27;s coefficient. This is done by transforming data points in &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; with a sine function such that the correlation coefficient is given as:

:formula_125

where formula_126 and formula_32 are the circular means of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. This measure can be useful in fields like meteorology where the angular direction of data is important.

===Partial correlation===

If a population or data-set is characterized by more than two variables, a partial correlation coefficient measures the strength of dependence between a pair of variables that is not accounted for by the way in which they both change in response to variations in a selected subset of the other variables.

===Pearson correlation coefficient in quantum systems===
For two observables, formula_128 and formula_129, in a bipartite quantum system Pearson correlation coefficient is defined as 

:formula_130

where
*formula_131 is the expectation value of the observable formula_5,
*formula_133 is the expectation value of the observable formula_7,
*formula_135 is the expectation value of the observable formula_136,
*formula_137 is the variance of the observable formula_5, and
*formula_139 is the variance of the observable formula_7.

formula_141 is symmetric, i.e., formula_142, and its absolute value is invariant under affine transformations.

==Decorrelation of &quot;n&quot; random variables==
It is always possible to remove the correlations between all pairs of an arbitrary number of random variables by using a data transformation, even if the relationship between the variables is nonlinear. A presentation of this result for population distributions is given by Cox &amp; Hinkley.

A corresponding result exists for reducing the sample correlations to zero. Suppose a vector of &quot;n&quot; random variables is observed &quot;m&quot; times. Let &quot;X&quot; be a matrix where formula_143 is the &quot;j&quot;th variable of observation &quot;i&quot;. Let formula_144 be an &quot;m&quot; by &quot;m&quot; square matrix with every element 1. Then &quot;D&quot; is the data transformed so every random variable has zero mean, and &quot;T&quot; is the data transformed so all variables have zero mean and zero correlation with all other variables – the sample correlation matrix of &quot;T&quot; will be the identity matrix. This has to be further divided by the standard deviation to get unit variance. The transformed variables will be uncorrelated, even though they may not be independent.

:formula_145
:formula_146

where an exponent of represents the matrix square root of the inverse of a matrix. The correlation matrix of &quot;T&quot; will be the identity matrix. If a new data observation &quot;x&quot; is a row vector of &quot;n&quot; elements, then the same transform can be applied to &quot;x&quot; to get the transformed vectors &quot;d&quot; and &quot;t&quot;:

:formula_147
:formula_148
This decorrelation is related to principal components analysis for multivariate data.

==Software implementations==
* R&#x27;s statistics base-package implements the correlation coefficient with codice_1, or (with the P value also) with codice_2.
* The SciPy Python library via codice_3.
* The Pandas and Polars Python libraries implement the Pearson correlation coefficient calculation as the default option for the methods codice_4 and codice_5, respectively.

<text>The , also known as , is Japan&#x27;s self-regulatory film regulator. Eirin was established on the model of the now-defunct American Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association&#x27;s Production Code Administration in June 1949, succeeding the US-led occupation authorities&#x27; role of film censorship during the Occupation of Japan. It classifies films into one of four categories depending on their suitability for viewing by minors of different ages.

==Description==
As in other countries, Eirin classifies films to indicate their suitability for minors. It considers eight criteria, such as whether the film contains sexual or violent material, and gives the film a rating in one of four categories. Although the ratings are sometimes controversial, Eirin&#x27;s defenders argue that its independence shields film makers from the more draconian alternative, government censorship.

During the opening credits (or in some cases, on the copyright screen immediately following the ending credits) of an Eirin-approved film, the Eirin logo is displayed prominently underneath or beside the movie&#x27;s title. Eirin has no legal power to ban films, but the Japan Association of Theatre Owners forbids its members from screening films that haven&#x27;t been classified by Eirin.

== History ==
During World War II the government of Japan censored films. The job of censoring was the responsibility of the Interior Ministry&#x27;s Police Bureau. In time censorship was subsumed with the motions picture law of 1939.

The was established in 1949 and was the predecessor to Eirin. The organization was criticized for hiring examiners who were part of the same movie industry that financed the organization, resulting in a conflict of interest. There was also criticism of the content of some films which came out at the time, such as Nikkatsu&#x27;s &quot;Season of the Sun&quot; based on the award-winning book by Shintaro Ishihara.

In response to the criticism Eirin began to bring in outsiders to join the commission in 1956, and reorganized into a self-financing, independent body. At that time it also changed its name to Eirin Kanri Iinkai, and is the foundation of today&#x27;s rating body.

==Ratings==
===Early ratings set===
In 1956, there were only two ratings.

*: Patrons of all ages are admitted.
*: Patrons under 18 years old and high schoolers are prohibited from admission.

===Introduction of Limited General Film rating===
In 1976, Limited General Film rating was introduced.

*: Patrons of all ages are admitted.
*: Patrons under 15 years old and junior high schoolers must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. In the following year, however, admission of patrons under 15 years old and junior high schoolers were prohibited even with parents, due to the rating not being enough enforced by most cinemas. The first Japanese film to use this rating was and the first non-Japanese film to use this rating was &quot;Snuff&quot; (released June 19, 1976), a movie claiming to show actual scenes of homicide.
*: Patrons under 18 years old and high schoolers are prohibited from admission.

===Introduction of PG-12 rating===
On May 1, 1998, all ratings were renamed and PG-12 was introduced.

* : All ages admitted.
*: Accompaniment required for under 12 years old and elementary schoolers.
*: Prohibited admission for under 15 years old and junior high schoolers.
*: Prohibited admission for under 18 years old and high schoolers.

===Current ratings sets===

On April 1, 2009, all ratings got renamed and revised, PG12 became advisory and school grades are not required to be admitted anymore.

====Not Applicable for Examination====
Films considered &quot;Not Applicable for Examination&quot; (審査適応区分外, &quot;Shinsa tekiō kubun-gai&quot;) contains more extreme depictions than R18+, will be treated as not suitable for screening by Eirin, and will be refused screening at movie theaters affiliated with the National Federation of Entertainment and Public Health Industry Associations (全国興行生活衛生同業組合連合会, &quot;Zenkoku kōgyō seikatsu eisei dōgyō kumiai rengō-kai&quot;).

==Criteria==
The eight criteria are the main focus of rating a film, those are themes, language, sex, nudity, violence, horror, drugs and crime.

===Themes===
*G: The themes dealing with family and social issues are presented in a way that is accessible, ethically appropriate and sensitive to young audiences.
*PG12: The film deals with realistic issues in adult society that are difficult for young people to understand, but it is carefully expressed.
*R15+: Human desires and serious social issues are depicted realistically and provocatively. In some cases, overlapping depictions of sex, violence, crime, etc., and extremely unethical matters are depicted with discretion.
*R18+: Human desires and unethical feelings and actions are depicted in a realistic and highly provocative manner. When necessary in the context, extremely antisocial and unethical themes such as pleasure murder, incest, cannibalism, and pedophilia are also depicted. As the subject matter or subject matter itself becomes more problematic, it is depicted and expressed in a carefully restrained manner, and the work as a whole does not unnecessarily promote interest in such matters or praise or affirm them.

===Language===
*G: Even if there are some criticisms, profanity, slander, or vulgar words, they are considered at the level of commonly used in daily life. Discriminatory, human rights infringing, and sexual language is avoided as much as possible.
*PG12: In the storyline, discriminatory, human rights violating, and sexual terms are sometimes used, but carefully worded. Attention is paid to verbal attacks and threats.
*R15+: Discriminatory and human rights-violating terms, names of genitalia, and words describing their states are sometimes used. However, in such cases, the strength of the language itself, the historical background, and the appropriateness of the depiction are questioned. Insulting or offensive expressions against specific individuals, groups, or facilities are handled with care.
*R18+: Unless required by the context, highly problematic discriminatory language is not used. Sexual terminology is not overused, and the work as a whole does not encourage or endorse discrimination or human rights violations.

===Sex===
*G: Lovely and consensual adult sex, even clothed, is depicted naturally, concisely, and gently. Sexual violence is limited to implication only, even when necessary for story development.
*PG12: Brief sexual love is expressed. Depending on the context, there may be depictions of sexual violence, but they are carefully restrained. Sexual depictions in front of young children, sexual terms, and sexual harassment must be expressed with caution.
*R15+: Although sexual expressions using full nudity are seen, sexual positions, sexual conversations, ecstasy, detail, length, and frequency are restrained. Sexual acts involving minors, sexual minorities, and the socially vulnerable are carefully restrained, as well as sexual violence and sexual crimes. Sexual perversions such as &quot;SM&quot; games, fetishism, and incest are even more carefully restrained.
*R18+: The film contains highly stimulating depictions of sexual acts, such as full-nude shots of the characters in the intercourse position, violent body movements, genital caressing and penetration, oral sex, and ejaculation, which are strongly reminiscent of the original. There is also group sex and the use of sexual instruments and restraints. However, even if necessary according to the context, the following scenes use more restrained expressions:&lt;br&gt;(1) Sexual acts and sexual attacks involving minors, sexual minorities, and the vulnerable people.&lt;br&gt;(2) Sexual violence, such as rape, group rape, humiliation, sexual torture, and bondage.&lt;br&gt;(3) Severe sexual perversions, such as &quot;SM&quot;, incest, pedophilia, bestiality, and necrophilia.

===Nudity===
*G: There is natural and brief nudity, but it is limited to carefully restrained depictions, especially in sexual contexts. Depictions of corpses are carefully expressed so as not to infringe on human dignity.
*PG12: It may depict natural, brief, isolated long shots of pubic nudity, but not full frontal nudity or genitalia. It is more cautious in sexually-themed contexts.
*R15+: There are natural, brief depictions of full nudity, and rare long shots of fully nude frontal view.&lt;br&gt;*The naturalistic childbirth scene is depicted with care.
*R18+: Natural nudity is frequent, and sometimes includes brief full-frontal long shots, however, genitals and hair are not shown or emphasized. There is no depiction of genitals, anus, or hair related to sexual acts, sexual violence, torture or abuse, drug taking, sexual crimes, menstruation, urination, excretion, etc.&lt;br&gt;*It excludes sexual nudity featuring actors under the age of 18.

===Violence===
*G: When fights, conflicts, or acts of vandalism are depicted, violence is not emphasized as a means of solving everyday problems. In scenes of mass violence, such as war, organized crime, historical dramas, and period dramas, the depiction of killing, blood, and corpses is carefully restrained. Dangerous games that can easily be copied by young children are carefully depicted.
*PG12: There is some blood and killing, but the depiction of mutilation, agony, and pain is suppressed. Attacks on the face, head, and heart are also suppressed. Violence against minors, vulnerable people, and animals may not be acceptable depending on the context. Long and detailed scenes are omitted.
*R15+: There are some violent scenes, rather shocking scenes, such as fatal bodily injury accompanied by blood splatter, however, the sense of realism and cruelty is kept to a minimum. Scenes in which the body is directly destroyed by weapons such as guns and swords are not depicted in detail. Depictions of torture, abuse, lynching, execution, indiscriminate mass murder, and sadistic serial murders are handled with restraint.
*R18+: There are depictions of bodily mutilation and destruction accompanied by the scattering of fresh blood, which are realistic, cruel, and extremely stimulating. Contextual necessity is important. The work as a whole lacks a spirit of rejecting violence, and there are no expressions that specifically emphasize violence and cruelty. The following scenes use even more restrained expressions:&lt;br&gt;(1) Violence and attacks against minors, the vulnerable people, and animals.&lt;br&gt;(2) Cruelty and brutality that lack sympathy for the victims and take pleasure in violence, especially torture, bizarre dissection of bodies and corpses, and organ removal.&lt;br&gt;(3) Aggravated depictions of sexual acts, drug use, heinous crimes, discrimination, and prejudice.&lt;br&gt;(4) Violence as sexual perversion, such as murder for pleasure, cannibalism, and sadism.

===Horror===
*G: The scary scenes are designed to be less disturbing and upsetting for younger audiences. Long, detailed and realistic depictions are avoided, and the ending is reassuring. Caution is also exercised in the treatment of superstition, fortune-telling, spiritualism and hypnotism.
*PG12: The film contains images of horror, including blood and grotesque scenes, but refrains from depicting the pain and agony of the victims. Attacks on monsters and other creatures are depicted, but no lengthy or detailed attacks on humans, especially minors, are shown.
*R15+: When including fictional supernatural beings, human or animal blood splatter, bodily mutilation, or agony, it is depicted in a restrained manner. No cruel attacks on minors are depicted.
*R18+: There is realistic fear involving agony and violence, as well as threats and coercion from attackers, but there are no particularly cruel or inhuman depictions of bloody festivals, satanic rituals, or gruesome murders.

===Drugs===
*G: Drug dealing is sometimes depicted in brief dialogue or as a background explanation of the incident, but use of hard drugs, thinner, etc. is not specified. Particular care should be taken in situations involving young children.
*PG12: The use of hard drugs, stimulants, poisons, etc., is kept to a minimum necessary for the storyline. Expressions that may stimulate the interests of minors are avoided.
*R15+: There are descriptions of the euphoria, delusions, and withdrawal symptoms that accompany taking drugs, but they are not long or detailed. Drug names and lethal doses are not described in detail. There are no aggravating depictions of violent crimes or sexual acts.
*R18+: Although the film also includes scenes of violence, crime, and sexual acts that accompany the euphoria, hallucinations, and withdrawal symptoms of drug use, it refrains from depicting sexual violence, sexual perversion, or heinous crimes. The film as a whole does not contain any scenes that encourage, approve, or glorify drug abuse.

===Crime===
*G: There are concise descriptions of crimes and incidents that are necessary for the development of the story. However, when it comes to minors and vulnerable people, careful consideration is given to situations in which a person is the victim or perpetrator of a heinous crime. Underage drinking and smoking are avoided, and bullying, delinquency, and bad behavior are not tolerated. Great attention is paid to crimes and incidents that occur in places and situations familiar to young people, such as suicide, self-harm, autopsy, surgery, etc.
*PG12: The film depicts theft, shoplifting, and criminal use of everyday objects like knives, mobile phones, and computers, and hypnosis and brainwashing, but avoids detailed depictions of juvenile delinquency and bad behavior. Murder, abandonment of bodies, and assault and abuse of minors and the vulnerable people are carefully restrained.
*R15+: The film depicts violent crimes such as murder, homicide, arson, and rape, as well as various crimes such as kidnapping, abduction, confinement, molestation, compensated dating, prostitution, and human trafficking, as well as social incidents such as indiscriminate terrorism. However, this is done with careful expression. Depictions of illegal surgery, abortion, and dangerous drug experiments are kept to a minimum.
*R18+: Violent crimes, incidents, and tragic accidents are also depicted in detail, but works that are so realistic that they could be linked to real-life crimes, or that only depict tragic accidents, brutal incidents, torture, executions, etc. are excluded. There is no expression in the work that specifically glorifies or affirms crimes and criminals.

<doc id="221710" wikidata="Q1343099" url="?curid=221710" title="Gakuryū Ishii">
<text>, formerly known as , is a Japanese filmmaker known for his stylistic punk films, which helped spark the cyberpunk movement in Japan. A number of contemporary filmmakers including Quentin Tarantino have cited Ishii&#x27;s films as an influence.

==Early life==
Born Toshihiro Ishii, (石井 聰亙), he grew up in Hakata, and because of all the American military bases in the area, he was exposed to a lot of American rock music. He spent his teenage years a part of the punk rock movement that grew in that region, singing and playing the guitar.

In 1977 he enrolled at Nihon University in Tokyo, and founded &quot;Kyōei-sha&quot; (Crazy Film Group). He borrowed equipment from the school to shoot his own 8mm and 16mm short films, which featured the style and philosophy of his punk roots. It was difficult for a young person in Japan to make films during that period, and he decided to skip the traditional corporate ladder route to film directing by just making the films himself.

==Career==
During his first year of college, one of Ishii&#x27;s short films called &quot;Panic High School&quot; was noticed by Nikkatsu, a movie studio known at the time for its pink films. Nikkatsu provided the funding to adapt the short into a feature-length film. Yukihiro Sawada co-directed the film with Ishii, who was still only a sophomore in college. It was around this time that he started going by Sogo Ishii.

Ishii directed his second feature &quot;Crazy Thunder Road&quot; as his senior thesis for university, and the 16mm film was subsequently bought by Toei, who distributed it in 35mm. As his fame started to grow, a popular punk band named Anarchy hired Ishii to shoot a promo for them, which resulted in a ten-minute film called &quot;Anarchy &#x27;80 Ishin&quot;. He also adapted Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s manga &quot;Run&quot; into the 30-minute film &quot;Shuffle&quot;. He continued to use the university&#x27;s film equipment as long as he could, but since he had no intentions of actually graduating, they eventually expelled him.

In 1982, Ishii directed &quot;Burst City&quot;, an action film about a wild gang of quasi-mutant bikers who ride into a town staging protests against the construction of a nearby nuclear reactor plant. The film starred members of Japanese punk bands The Roosters, The Rockers, The Stalin and Inu, among others. He became a favorite among rebel and punk cineastes in Japan. The film is also credited as a precursor to the underground Japanese cyberpunk movement that emerged later in the decade.

Ishii took a short break from filmmaking in 1983 to form a band called Sogo Ishii and the Bacillus Army, which recorded one album, &quot;Asia Strikes Back&quot;. He also created a 30 min film for the band that was played during their tour. In 1984 he released his fourth feature film, &quot;The Crazy Family&quot;.

After the release of &quot;The Crazy Family&quot;, there was a period of ten years where Ishii couldn&#x27;t get any funding to make another feature film. His previous films had been very popular with foreign film festival audiences, but not with Japanese ones: they didn&#x27;t understand his films. He spent his time during this gap making shorts, music videos, and concert films, including ones for The Roosters and Einstürzende Neubauten.

Finally in 1994, he was hired to direct the feature film &quot;Angel Dust&quot;. Around this time he started to change his filmmaking style partly because he wanted to challenge himself to something new, but also because it had been very difficult to find funding for the types of films he made before. During this period he directed two films that were less plot driven: &quot;August in the Water&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth of Dreams&quot;.

The actor Tadanobu Asano teamed up with Ishii in 1996 to form the experimental noise band MACH-1.67, which would later compose some of the music for the film &quot;Electric Dragon 80.000 V&quot;. Ishii directed two films back to back: &quot;Gojoe&quot;, a 2000 action film about 12th century Japan, and &quot;Electric Dragon 80.000 V&quot;, a 2001 black-and-white 55-minute film starring Tadanobu Asano and Masatoshi Nagase. These two films combined the abstract style of his recent films with the intense energy of his early works. Ishii himself described this transition: &quot;When I was young, all I could think about was speed. Then I wanted to start to slow things down a bit—now both are important.&quot; While &quot;Electric Dragon&quot; was praised by critics, both films were huge financial flops: so much so that they put Suncent Cinema Works out of business.

Those films were followed by another ten-year gap in making feature films. Ishii started teaching film at Kobe Design University in 2006, and spent those ten years focused on teaching and experimenting with digital filmmaking by creating music videos, television episodes, and experimental shorts.

In 2012, he returned with &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anyone Alive?&quot;, changing his name from Sogo Ishii to Gakuryu Ishii (&quot;Gakuryu&quot; meaning &quot;dragon&quot;). In 2013 he released &quot;The Flower of Shanidar&quot;, which stars Gō Ayano and Hana Kuroki. In 2016, Ishii released the erotic fantasy film &quot;Bitter Honey&quot; (&quot;Mitsu no aware&quot;), based on the novel by Murō Saisei, about the relationship between a dying writer, played by Ren Osugi, and his goldfish who takes the form of a beautiful girl, played by Fumi Nikaidō. In June 2018 he released &quot;Punk Samurai Slash Down&quot;, which was produced by NTT DoCoMo.

<doc id="221714" wikidata="Q3761739" url="?curid=221714" title="Battle Royale (novel)">
<text>is a Japanese dystopian horror novel by journalist Koushun Takami. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is the first novel from Takami and was originally completed in 1996 but was not published until 1999. The book tells the story of junior high school students who are forced to fight each other to the death in a program run by a fictional fascist, totalitarian Japanese government known as the Republic of Greater East Asia.

The dystopian novel was previously entered into the 1997 Japan Horror Fiction Awards but was eventually rejected in the final round due to concerns over its depictions of students killing each other. Upon publication in 1999, the novel became a surprise bestseller.

In 2000, one year after publication, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; was adapted into a manga series, written by Takami himself, and a feature film. The film was both controversial and successful, becoming one of the year&#x27;s highest-grossing films as well as prompting condemnation by Japan&#x27;s National Diet. The film spawned a sequel, and two more brief manga adaptations were also created.

==Plot==

&quot;Battle Royale&quot; takes place in a fictional fascist Japan in the year 1997. The state, known as the , arose after an alternate World War II where Japan emerged victorious, and a rebellion was put down by the combined military and police forces. The government controls everything, alongside an unnamed dictator with a strong cult of personality, able to bend the whims of the populace; anything &quot;immoral&quot; – such as rock music – is banned, unless it beautifies the government. 

The government has established a military program, the , wherein fifty randomly selected classes of third-year junior high school students are kidnapped, dropped into a remote location, and forced to kill one another until only one student of each class remains. Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness – in actuality, it is meant to instill terror and distrust in all of Japan&#x27;s citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion by showcasing the government&#x27;s power and ability to target citizens&#x27; families and preying on the fear of being killed by a friend.

A group of students from , a junior high school in the fictional Kagawa Prefecture town of Shiroiwa, prepare for a field trip. Among them are wannabe rock star Shuya Nanahara, whose father was killed by the regime; Noriko Nakagawa, the demure crush of Shuya&#x27;s best friend; Shogo Kawada, a quiet, tough young transfer student; and sociopathic prodigy Kazuo Kiriyama. En route, they are gassed – the &quot;field trip&quot; was a ruse for the Program.

They awake in a classroom on a small, vacated island, surrounded by troops, and wearing metal collars around their necks. A teacher, psychopathic sadist Kinpatsu Sakamochi, briefs the students: the class has been chosen to participate in the Program. The students are also given a time limit. If twenty-four hours pass without someone being killed, then all of the collars will be detonated simultaneously, and there will be no winner. It is mentioned that only 0.5% of Programs end in this fashion. The students are issued survival packs and a random weapon/tool and sent out onto the island individually. While most students receive guns and knives, some acquire relatively useless items like boomerangs, dartboard darts, or a fork. Hiroki Sugimura finds a radar device that tracks nearby students, and Toshinori Oda receives a bulletproof vest.

To make sure the students obey the rules and kill each other, the metal collars around their necks track their positions. They will explode if they attempt to remove the collars or linger in &quot;Forbidden Zones&quot;: randomly chosen areas of the map that increase in number over time, re-sculpting and shrinking the battlefield and forcing the students to move around. The collars secretly transmit sound back to the game organizers, allowing them to hear the students&#x27; conversations, root out escape plans, and log their activities.

The students desperately fight amongst each other for survival, with mentally ill bullies Mitsuko Souma and Kiriyama killing many. Shuya takes Noriko under his wing after his best friend is killed, believing that he has a duty to honor his fallen friend by protecting his crush. Shogo – who is revealed to be the winner of a previous Battle Royale and hopes to put an end to the Program – avoids the fighting, joining with Shuya. Shuya&#x27;s friend, athlete Shinji Mimura, attempts to hack the system running the Program and bomb the building where Sakamochi and the other personnel overseeing the Program are stationed, but is killed by Kiriyama.

Eventually, halfway through the third day, only Shogo, Shuya, Noriko, and Kiriyama remain, with Kiriyama dead set on hunting down the trio. After a frantic car chase, Kiriyama is finally gunned down. Still, Shuya and Noriko are held at gunpoint by Shogo, who taunts them over being so naive as to trust anyone in the Program: the collars record gunshots and Shuya and Noriko flatlining.

Declared the winner by Sakamochi, Shogo is escorted to his transport off the island, surrounded by soldiers. Sakamochi, however, reveals that he knows Shuya and Noriko are alive and that his supposed execution of Noriko and Shuya was a ruse after he found a way to disable their collars and attempts to kill Shogo. Shogo kills him as a hidden Shuya and Noriko hijack the ship and kill the soldiers on board. As the boat sails towards the mainland, Shogo succumbs to his wounds sustained during the fight with Kiriyama and dies, but not before thanking Shuya and Noriko for being his friends.

On the advice of Shogo, Shuya and Noriko escape to the mainland and plan to flee to a democratic America, pursued by the government.

==Characters==
* Shuya Nanahara – An orphan whose parents were killed for taking part in anti-government activities. Shuya is a self-proclaimed &quot;rock star,&quot; listening to and playing rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music in spite of the ban on the genre. After the death of his best friend Yoshitoki Kuninobu, he vows to protect Kuninobu&#x27;s crush, Noriko Nakagawa, in his stead.

==Background==
===Origin===
In the 1990s, Koushun Takami came up with the original story concept for &quot;Battle Royale&quot; after having a dream. Takami stated in 2009:

He came up with the title &quot;Battle Royale&quot; after discussing his story concept with his friends, who said it sounded like a reimagined pro-wrestling battle royal match. Takami then took an interest in the social aspect of a battle royal match, such as how former enemies work together in order to defeat a stronger foe and particularly how former allies betray each other for their own glory. For the worldbuilding, he was inspired by his upbringing in 1960s Japan, when large groups of revolutionaries fought back against police brutality. His depiction of a totalitarian fascist government was also influenced by his favourite Stephen King novel, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; (1979), which is about a walking contest organized by a totalitarian government.

===Publication===
Takami completed &quot;Battle Royale&quot; when he stopped working as a journalist in 1996. The story was rejected in the final round of the 1997 , which took place in March 1998, because of its controversial content. Masao Higashi, who took part in the award&#x27;s preliminary selection committee, later suspected this was due to its backdrop of students killing each other being too reminiscent of the Kobe child murders committed the previous year. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part bunkobon by Gentosha.

Takami describes the characters as possibly all being &quot;kind of alike&quot;, being &quot;all the same&quot; despite differing appearances and hobbies, and being static characters. Takami used these descriptions in contrast to the manga adaptation he wrote, with Masayuki Taguchi illustrating, which he believes has a more diverse and well-developed cast.

&quot;Battle Royale&quot; was translated into English by Yuji Oniki and released in North America by Viz Media on February 26, 2003. An expanded edition with a revision of Oniki&#x27;s translation and an afterword by Takami was published on November 17, 2009, by Haikasoru, a division of Viz Media. This version also included an interview with the director of the book&#x27;s film adaptation, Kinji Fukasaku. Viz released a new translation by Nathan Collins on April 1, 2014, under the title &quot;Battle Royale: Remastered&quot;. They also published &quot;The Battle Royale Slam Book: Essays on the Cult Classic by Koushun Takami&quot; on the same day, which includes essays on the details of the novel and the controversies surrounding it as well as its adaptations written by science-fiction, horror, and thriller authors such as Brian Keene, John Skipp, and Catherynne M. Valente.

==Adaptations==

===Manga===
A manga adaptation, written by Takami and illustrated by Masayuki Taguchi, was serialized in Akita Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Young Champion&quot; from 2000 to 2005. It was collected into fifteen &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, and published in North America by Tokyopop from 2003 to 2006.

A second manga, &quot;Battle Royale II: Blitz Royale&quot;, ran in &quot;Young Champion&quot; from 2003 to 2004. Written and illustrated by Hiroshi Tomizawa, it was collected into two &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes.

In 2011, a two chapter spin-off manga titled &quot;Battle Royale: Angels&#x27; Border&quot; was drawn by Mioko Ohnishi and Youhei Oguma (each drawing one chapter). It focuses on the six girls who holed up in the lighthouse, was published in &quot;Young Champion&quot; and later combined into one &quot;tankōbon&quot; volume on January 20, 2012. The single volume was published in North America by Viz Media on June 17, 2014.

===Feature films===
&quot;Battle Royale&quot; was adapted into a 2000 feature film of the same name, directed by Kinji Fukasaku and written by his son Kenta Fukasaku. The film was also controversial and successful, with it being condemned by members of Japan&#x27;s National Diet on grounds of it being harmful to the youth, yet becoming one of the year&#x27;s highest-grossing films. It was followed in 2003 by &quot;Battle Royale II: Requiem&quot;.

In June 2006, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that New Line Cinema, with producers Neal Moritz and Roy Lee, intended to produce a new American film adaptation of &quot;Battle Royale&quot;. However, New Line never secured remake rights and, following the Virginia Tech shooting in April 2007, Lee stated that prospects for the project had been &quot;seriously shaken.&quot; In 2012, Lee stated a remake would no longer be possible due to the release of the film adaptation of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, which has been criticized for its similarities to &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, stating, &quot;Audiences would see it as just a copy of &quot;Games&quot; — most of them wouldn&#x27;t know that &quot;Battle Royale&quot; came first. It&#x27;s unfair, but that&#x27;s reality.&quot; However, he stated that he might return to the film in ten years to &quot;develop a &quot;Battle Royale&quot; movie for the next generation.&quot;

===Theater===
In 2012, the Sipat Lawin Ensemble and two other college theater groups in the Philippines, made an unofficial loose adaptation of the novel into a live-action performance called &quot;Battalia Royale&quot;, which had its debut at the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Performances were also held at an abandoned high school in Quezon City.

===Television===
On July 26, 2012, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that The CW Television Network had been in discussions with Hollywood representatives about the possibility of turning &quot;Battle Royale&quot; into an American television show. According to a spokesperson, the talks were only preliminary, but if a deal could be reached, the network would acquire rights to Koushun Takami&#x27;s novel, then expand on it for an hourlong dramatic series. Joyce Jun, a Hollywood attorney representing U.S. rights to the title, states that &quot;there is no deal in place.&quot; A CW spokesman only confirmed there had been some discussion, declining to comment further.

At the Television Critics Association winter press tour on January 13, 2013, CW president Mark Pedowitz stated &quot;At this time, we&#x27;re not planning to do anything with &quot;Battle Royale&quot;.&quot; He clarified that the reports stemmed from one phone call he made to see if the rights to the book were available and also noted that his interest in the novel predated the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

==Reception==
Upon publication in 1999, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; became a best-seller in Japan. The original Japanese novel sold more than 1million copies, before being translated into nearly a dozen languages.

The novel was entered into the 1997 Japan Horror Fiction Awards, but was eventually rejected in the final round with no winner that year. All three members of the final round&#x27;s selection committee that year admitted &quot;Battle Royale&quot; was the best work, but declined to award it due to its controversial content. Hiroshi Aramata said that while it was the best nominee in terms of &quot;story, structure, and subject matter,&quot; he felt it was too much of a &quot;Kinpachi-sensei&quot; parody and suspected its content would cause problems. Katsuhiko Takahashi felt that although it was the superior work as far as its construction as a novel, giving the award to a story about students killing each other at &quot;this time&quot; would hurt the reputation of the competition. Mariko Hayashi said that while she believed it was the best of the four novels, it was like reading an &quot;unpleasant near-future manga&quot; and &quot;No matter how squarely it might be horror or how interesting it might be, I&#x27;m not so sure we should be writing stories like this.&quot; In 2001, Kōji Ōnuma wrote , a dissertation that explores the themes of the book.

&quot;Battle Royale&quot; has been critically acclaimed abroad. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, writer Stephen King included it as one of the seven books in his 2005 summer reading list, after it was recommended to him by novelist Kelly Braffet (writer of &quot;Josie and Jack&quot;). King described &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as &quot;an insanely entertaining pulp riff that combines &quot;Survivor&quot; with World Wrestling Entertainment. Or maybe &quot;Royale&quot; is just insane.&quot; He also notes that it has some similarities to his own novel &quot;The Long Walk&quot;. He concludes the brief review with a &quot;No prob,&quot; as &quot;Takami&#x27;s Springsteen-quoting teenagers are fond of saying.&quot;

David N. Alderman, writing for the Red Room site, gave &quot;Battle Royale&quot; a score of 4½ out of 5 stars, stating that the &quot;story itself is brilliant. Touted as being extremely controversial, especially for the time it was released, the book opens up all sorts of doors to conversations and thoughts about psychology, murder, survival, love, loyalty, and moral ground.&quot; While noting that those who &quot;cringe at slash and hack&quot; should &quot;steer away from this&quot; since &quot;it is a bit gory,&quot; he states that it is &quot;definitely worth the read&quot; and concludes that it has &quot;touches of romance, and definitely some great moral themes to spark off in-depth conversations with others.&quot; &quot;Complete Review&quot; gave the novel a B rating, describing it as &quot;a perfectly fine thriller, with a fun premise, quite well drawn-out.&quot; In &quot;The Journal of the Lincoln Heights Literary Society&quot;, Tom Good praises the novel, concluding that, as &quot;a pulp-fiction horror tale, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; delivers plenty of thrills, action, suspense and fun.&quot;

==Legacy==
Since its release, the novel and its film adaptation have had an influence on later works. These include filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, most notably his &quot;Kill Bill&quot; films; the character Gogo Yubari, played by Chiaki Kuriyama, is similar to the character she plays in the &quot;Battle Royale&quot; film, Takako Chigusa. V.A. Musetto of the &quot;New York Post&quot; also compared it to &quot;The Condemned&quot;, which the critic called &quot;a bad rip-off&quot; of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as well as &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;. Critics have also noted the influence of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; on other later works, such as the 2008 film &quot;Kill Theory&quot;, the 2009 film &quot;The Tournament&quot;, and the 2016 film &quot;The Belko Experiment&quot;, and have noted similarities with the novel and film franchise &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;. The manga, anime and film franchise &quot;Gantz&quot; and the 2007 video game &quot;The World Ends with You&quot; have both been compared to &quot;Battle Royale&quot;.

The 2008 American young adult novel &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; by Suzanne Collins has been accused of being strikingly similar to &quot;Battle Royale&quot; in terms of the basic plot premise. While Collins maintains that she &quot;had never heard of that book until her book was turned in&quot;, Susan Dominus of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reports that &quot;the parallels are striking enough that Collins&#x27;s work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff,&quot; but argued that &quot;there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently.&quot; The general consensus in the time since has been one of amicable controversy, especially since the release of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film adaptation. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; author Takami said he appreciated fans &quot;standing up&quot; for his book, but stated that he thinks &quot;every novel has something to offer,&quot; and that if &quot;readers find value in either book, that&#x27;s all an author can ask for.&quot;

The 2012 comic &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; has a similar plot to &quot;Battle Royale&quot;. Additionally, the cover of its first issue bears a homage to the &quot;Battle Royale&quot; film poster; featuring the main characters posed in the same manner and a similarly designed logo.

The novel and especially its film adaptation have been influential in global popular culture, inspiring numerous works of fiction in a number of different media, particularly in East Asia and the Western world. Since the film&#x27;s release, the term &quot;battle royale&quot; has been used to refer to a fictional narrative genre and/or mode of entertainment inspired by the film, where a select group of people are instructed to kill each off until there is a triumphant survivor. The &quot;battle royale&quot; phenomenon has become especially popular in the 2010s. A video game genre with the same name became popular in the 2010s, with games such as &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;, &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, and &quot;Apex Legends&quot; setting player-count records. Other works focused on the doubt and mistrust among a group of people in a &quot;murder game&quot;, such as the &quot;Saw&quot; film series, &quot;The Cube&quot;, and games in the &quot;Danganronpa&quot; series.

In 2021, &quot;Squid Game&quot; creator Hwang Dong-hyuk cited &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, particularly the manga version, as an inspiration behind the hit Netflix show.

<text>Direct-to-video or straight-to-video refers to the release of a film, television series, short or special to the public immediately on home video formats rather than an initial theatrical release or television premiere. This distribution strategy was prevalent before streaming platforms came to dominate the TV and movie distribution markets.

Because sequels or prequels of larger-budget films may be released direct-to-video, review references to direct-to-video releases are often pejorative. Direct-to-video release has also become profitable for independent filmmakers and smaller companies. Some direct-to-video genre films (with a high-profile star) can generate well in excess of $50 million revenue worldwide.

==Reasons for releasing direct to video==
A production studio may decide not to generally release a TV show or film for several possible reasons: a low budget, a lack of support from a TV network, negative reviews, its controversial nature, that it may appeal to a small niche market, or a simple lack of general public interest. Studios, limited in the annual number of films to which they grant cinematic releases, may choose to pull the completed film from the theaters, or never exhibit it in theaters at all. Studios then generate revenue through video sales and rentals. Direct-to-video films are marketed mostly through colorful box covers, instead of advertising, and are not covered by publications like &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot;.

The first direct-to-video release to go into production was &quot;E. Nick: A Legend in His Own Mind&quot; in 1984 produced by CineTel Films.

Direct-to-video releases have historically carried a stigma of lower technical or artistic quality than theatrical releases. Some films released direct-to-video are films which have been completed but were never released in movie theaters. This delay often occurs when a studio doubts a film&#x27;s commercial prospects to justify a full cinema release or because its release window has closed. In film industry slang, such films are referred to as having been &quot;vaulted&quot;. Like B-movies shown in drive-in theaters in the mid-20th century, direct-to-video films employ both former stars and young actors who may become stars later.

Direct-to-video releases can be done for films which cannot be shown theatrically due to controversial content, or because the cost involved in a theatrical release is beyond the releasing company.

Animated sequels and feature-length episodes of animated series are also often released in this fashion. The first feature length animated film to be released direct-to-video in the United States was &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation&quot; in 1992. The practice of creating and releasing regular fiction specifically for video did not really take off until 1994, with Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; and Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure&quot;, neither of which was intended to hit theaters at any point in its production. Several of the animated sequels, like MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue&quot; from 1998, have sparked criticism due to the deliberate neglect of the original source material by creative content limits as these franchises will abruptly discontinue. Several other film series will be continuous if they become more successful, like &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; for instance (their video debut &quot;Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island&quot; became one of the best-selling DTV films of all time.).

By 1994, an average of six new direct-to-video films appeared each week. Erotic thrillers and R-rated action films were the two most successful genres. Family films became more important than such genres later in the 1990s, as retailers stocked more copies of blockbuster films instead of more titles. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:

Some horror films that are unsuccessful in theaters, like &quot;Witchcraft&quot;, begin successful direct-to-video series. Studios may also release sequels or spin-offs to a successful live action film straight to DVD, due to a lack of budget in comparison to the original.

===Pornography===
During the Golden Age of Porn in the 1970s, many pornographic films were released in theatres, some of which became some of the highest-grossing films in their release years, and in the pornography industry altogether. Toward the 1980s, porn began to shift to video release, because video allowed the producers to work on extremely low budgets and dispense with some film production elements, like scripts, and the increased privacy and convenience of the format change were preferred by the target market. During the late 1990s and onward, pornographers began releasing content on the Internet.

==Physical format releases==

===Direct-to-video films screened theatrically===
Occasionally, a studio that makes a movie that was prepared as a direct-to-video film will release it theatrically at the last minute due to the success of another film with a similar subject matter or an ultimate studio decision. &quot;&quot; is an example of this. However, despite the movie&#x27;s critically acclaimed success, its box-office performance was very poor, which has been attributed to the last minute nature of its theatrical release. The film had much better commercial success in its subsequent home video releases.

Other times, a direct-to-video movie may get a limited theatrical screening in order to build excitement for the actual release of the video such as was done for 2010&#x27;s &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths&quot;, and &quot;Planet Hulk&quot;, 2016&#x27;s &quot;&quot; or 2013&#x27;s &quot;Sharknado&quot;. In some cases, other direct-to-video films can also be theatrically released in other countries.

===Direct-to-disc or DVD premiere===

As DVDs gradually replaced VHS videocassettes, the term &quot;direct-to-DVD&quot; replaced &quot;direct-to-video&quot; in some instances. However, the word &quot;video&quot; does not necessarily refer to videocassettes. Many publications continue to use the term &quot;direct-to-video&quot; for DVDs or Blu-rays. Both disc-based release types may also be referred to as &quot;direct-to-disc&quot;. A new term sometimes used is &quot;DVD premiere&quot; (DVDP). Such films can cost as little as $20 million, about a third of the average cost of a Hollywood release. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;American Pie Presents: Band Camp&quot; sold more than one million copies in a week.

Some direct-to-DVD releases recently have tended to feature actors who were formerly bankable stars. In 2005, salaries for some of these direct-to-DVD actors in the multimillion-dollar range from $2 to $4 million (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and $4.5 to $10 million (Steven Seagal), in some cases exceeding the actors&#x27; theatrical rates.

==Digital releases==

With the increasing prominence of digital distribution platforms in the 2000s and 2010s, direct-to-digital releases began to emerge alongside, or in lieu of home video. In November 2007, Ed Burns&#x27; &quot;Purple Violets&quot; became the first film to &quot;premiere&quot; exclusively for sale on iTunes Store, being exclusive to the platform for a month exclusively. It had premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April, where it was reviewed positively, but only received modest distribution offers. At the time, it was not very common for consumers to make digital movie purchases.

As part of a push by the service towards original content, the subscription video on demand service Netflix began to acquire feature films for distribution on its service in the 2010s, including the 2013 documentary &quot;The Square&quot;, and its first feature film in 2015 — &quot;Beasts of No Nation&quot;. Netflix pursued a simultaneous release strategy for its films, partnering with a distributor for a limited theatrical release (in order to maintain eligibility for awards requiring theatrical release, such as the Academy Awards) simultaneous with their availability to subscribers. As this practice violates the traditional release windows mandated by the cinema industry, major chains have typically declined to screen the films. Since 2018, Netflix has partially backpedaled from this strategy, giving its films a one-month theatrical run before their premiere on the Netflix service.

Unique circumstances have also resulted in direct-to-digital releases, sometimes alongside a limited theatrical release; the 2014 film &quot;The Interview&quot; was released simultaneously on digital and at selected cinemas, after major chains dropped the film due to terrorist threats by a hacking group believed to have ties to North Korea (whose regime is satirized in the film). The group had also leaked confidential data from the internal servers of the film&#x27;s distributor, Sony Pictures.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in worldwide closures of cinemas due to economic restrictions and guidance against public gatherings, which prompted direct-to-digital releases for several major films; the Chinese film &quot;Lost in Russia&quot; was acquired by ByteDance for 630 million yuan (almost 100 million in US dollars) and streamed on its platforms (including TikTok) for free in lieu of a theatrical release, as part of a larger relationship with the company and the film&#x27;s distributor Huanxi Media. A number of U.S. films were shifted directly to video-on-demand rentals in lieu of a theatrical release,&quot;&quot; while some have been sold directly to subscription services, including Disney+, Max, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video.

==OVA and V-Cinema in Japan==
OV (&quot;original video&quot;) are movies made for direct-to-video release in the Japanese market. OVA (&quot;original video animation&quot;) is distinguished from OVM (&quot;original video movies&quot;) or V-Cinema, which usually refer to non-animated works. Different production studios may use other labels like &quot;V drama&quot;. 

The OVA market developed in the mid-1980s. The lax restrictions and censorship in comparison to broadcast television appealed to filmmakers, allowing them to include more controversial content, as the films did not need to rely on sponsored advertisements for financial support. The result was animated films with greater sexual, violent, or political content. The market continued to expand during the Japanese asset price bubble and began to decline with the collapse of the bubble in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

With the rise of VHS home video and the decline of the Japanese economy in the late 1980s, film studios struggled to recoup investments on big-budget films. (See Cinema of Japan) Inspired by the success of OVAs, Toei released its first V-Cinema, &quot;Crime Hunter&quot;, in March 1989. Following Toei&#x27;s success, other studios began to release a slew of direct-to-video movies. Relaxed censorship in V-Cinema gave way to the premier and rise of expressive auteur directors such as Takashi Miike, Hideo Nakata, Shinji Aoyama, and Kiyoshi Kurosawa. As the release of these titles were outside of usual distribution, studios and directors worked quickly to capitalize on niche markets or upcoming and current trends to increase financial returns. This period of history in Japanese cinema has been described by film journalist Tom Mes as &quot;a far more diverse and vibrant film scene [than previous eras]&quot;. By 1995, the V-cinema industry was in decline, but the explosion in quantity and variety of such movies established and cemented genres like J-horror and yakuza films.

The success of OVAs and V-Cinema has resulted in less stigma regarding direct-to-video releases in Japan than in western markets. While there are still OVA and V-Cinema releases, the market is considerably smaller than it was in the 1980s and 1990s.

==&quot;Online Big Movies&quot; in China==
In the mid-to-late 2010s, low-budget B-movies that are made exclusively for digital streaming became a trend in China; these films are called &quot;Online Big Movies&quot; (&quot;OBM&quot;; 网络大电影 in Chinese, or simply 网大). The word &quot;Big&quot; in the name was meant to be sardonic, as most of these films are often made on a very low budget and featuring mostly unknown cast members and sometimes nonprofessional actors. However, increasingly, the budget for these films have been slowly climbing up, due to the success of these films on digital distribution platforms; the budget for these films can now range from less than 1 million yuan to upwards of 10 or 20 million yuan. Although these &quot;Online Big Movies&quot; rarely feature well-known actors, in recent years, many &quot;Online Big Movies&quot; have hired veteran actors from Hong Kong action cinema and Taiwanese cinema to join its cast. These movies are also to be differentiated from films that are made for theatrical release but were later acquired by digital streaming services, in that these &quot;Online Big Movies&quot; are produced by internet companies with the sole intent of digital release.

In additional to the digital distribution of these films in China, many of the &quot;Online Big Movies&quot; have also been released on digital platforms outside of China, such as on YouTube. Several YouTube channels, such as Q1Q2 Movie Channel Official and YOUKU MOVIE are popular channels that distributes these &quot;Online Big Movies&quot;.

<doc id="221722" wikidata="Q1050272" url="?curid=221722" title="Standard score">
<text>In statistics, the standard score is the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score (i.e., an observed value or data point) is above or below the mean value of what is being observed or measured. Raw scores above the mean have positive standard scores, while those below the mean have negative standard scores. 

It is calculated by subtracting the population mean from an individual raw score and then dividing the difference by the population standard deviation. This process of converting a raw score into a standard score is called standardizing or normalizing (however, &quot;normalizing&quot; can refer to many types of ratios; see &quot;Normalization&quot; for more). 

Standard scores are most commonly called &quot;z&quot;-scores; the two terms may be used interchangeably, as they are in this article. Other equivalent terms in use include z-value, z-statistic, normal score, standardized variable and pull in high energy physics. 

Computing a z-score requires knowledge of the mean and standard deviation of the complete population to which a data point belongs; if one only has a sample of observations from the population, then the analogous computation using the sample mean and sample standard deviation yields the &quot;t&quot;-statistic.

== Calculation==

If the population mean and population standard deviation are known, a raw score 
&quot;x&quot; is converted into a standard score by

:formula_1

where:

: &quot;μ&quot; is the mean of the population,
: &quot;σ&quot; is the standard deviation of the population.

The absolute value of z represents the distance between that raw score &quot;x&quot; and the population mean in units of the standard deviation. z is negative when the raw score is below the mean, positive when above.

Calculating z using this formula requires use of the population mean and the population standard deviation, not the sample mean or sample deviation. However, knowing the true mean and standard deviation of a population is often an unrealistic expectation, except in cases such as standardized testing, where the entire population is measured.

When the population mean and the population standard deviation are unknown, the standard score may be estimated by using the sample mean and sample standard deviation as estimates of the population values.

In these cases, the z-score is given by

:formula_2

where:

:formula_3 is the mean of the sample,
: &quot;S&quot; is the standard deviation of the sample.

Though it should always be stated, the distinction between use of the population and sample statistics often is not made. In either case, the numerator and denominator of the equations have the same units of measure so that the units cancel out through division and z is left as a dimensionless quantity.

== Applications ==
=== Z-test===

The z-score is often used in the z-test in standardized testing – the analog of the Student&#x27;s t-test for a population whose parameters are known, rather than estimated. As it is very unusual to know the entire population, the t-test is much more widely used.

=== Prediction intervals===

The standard score can be used in the calculation of prediction intervals. A prediction interval [&quot;L&quot;,&quot;U&quot;], consisting of a lower endpoint designated &quot;L&quot; and an upper endpoint designated &quot;U&quot;, is an interval such that a future observation &quot;X&quot; will lie in the interval with high probability formula_4, i.e.

:formula_5
By determining the quantile z such that
:formula_6
it follows:
:formula_7

=== Process control===
In process control applications, the Z value provides an assessment of the degree to which a process is operating off-target.

=== Comparison of scores measured on different scales: ACT and SAT ===

When scores are measured on different scales, they may be converted to z-scores to aid comparison. Dietz et al. give the following example, comparing student scores on the (old) SAT and ACT high school tests. The table shows the mean and standard deviation for total scores on the SAT and ACT. Suppose that student A scored 1800 on the SAT, and student B scored 24 on the ACT. Which student performed better relative to other test-takers?

The z-score for student A is formula_8

The z-score for student B is formula_9

Because student A has a higher z-score than student B, student A performed better compared to other test-takers than did student B.

=== Percentage of observations below a z-score ===
Continuing the example of ACT and SAT scores, if it can be further assumed that both ACT and SAT scores are normally distributed (which is approximately correct), then the z-scores may be used to calculate the percentage of test-takers who received lower scores than students A and B.

=== Cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling ===
&quot;For some multivariate techniques such as multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis, the concept of distance between the units in the data is often of considerable interest and importance… When the variables in a multivariate data set are on different scales, it makes more sense to calculate the distances after some form of standardization.&quot;

===Principal components analysis===
In principal components analysis, &quot;Variables measured on different scales or on a common scale with widely differing ranges are often standardized.&quot;

=== Relative importance of variables in multiple regression: standardized regression coefficients ===
Standardization of variables prior to multiple regression analysis is sometimes used as an aid to interpretation.
(page 95) state the following.

&quot;The standardized regression slope is the slope in the regression equation if X and Y are standardized … Standardization of X and Y is done by subtracting the respective means from each set of observations and dividing by the respective standard deviations … In multiple regression, where several X variables are used, the standardized regression coefficients quantify the relative contribution of each X variable.&quot;

However, Kutner et al. (p 278) give the following caveat: &quot;… one must be cautious about interpreting any regression coefficients, whether standardized or not. The reason is that when the predictor variables are correlated among themselves, … the regression coefficients are affected by the other predictor variables in the model … The magnitudes of the standardized regression coefficients are affected not only by the presence of correlations among the predictor variables but also by the spacings of the observations on each of these variables. Sometimes these spacings may be quite arbitrary. Hence, it is ordinarily not wise to interpret the magnitudes of standardized regression coefficients as reflecting the comparative importance of the predictor variables.&quot;

==Standardizing in mathematical statistics==

In mathematical statistics, a random variable &quot;X&quot; is standardized by subtracting its expected value formula_10 and dividing the difference by its standard deviation formula_11

:formula_12

If the random variable under consideration is the sample mean of a random sample formula_13 of &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_14

then the standardized version is

:formula_15
:Where the standardised sample mean&#x27;s variance was calculated as follows:
:formula_16

==T-score==

In educational assessment, T-score is a standard score Z shifted and scaled to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.

In bone density measurements, the T-score is the standard score of the measurement compared to the population of healthy 30-year-old adults, and has the usual mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

<doc id="221723" wikidata="Q352233" url="?curid=221723" title="Ian Ziering">
<text>Ian Andrew Ziering (; born March 30, 1964) is an American actor best known for his role as Steve Sanders on the television series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, which he played from 1990 to 2000. He is also the voice of Vinnie on &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot;. From 2013 to 2018, he starred as Fin Shepard in the &quot;Sharknado&quot; film series. In 2019, he played the DC Comics character Blue Devil on the series &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;.

==Early life==
Ziering was born in Newark, New Jersey, the youngest of three boys for Muriel (1925–1998) and Paul M. Ziering (1921–2008), an educator, orchestra leader, and saxophonist. He grew up in West Orange, New Jersey and has two older brothers, Jeff and Barry. Ziering is Jewish, with his family originating from Russia and Austria. He graduated from West Orange High School in 1982, and from William Paterson University in 1988.

==Career==
In 1990, Ziering began his portrayal of the character Steve Sanders on the hit series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Sanders was a high school student and friend of Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestley), one of the series&#x27; other central characters. He is one of only four series regulars to appear on the show for its entire duration of ten seasons until 2000.

In 1998, Ziering was cast as the voice of Dr. Niko &quot;Nick&quot; Tatopoulos in &quot;&quot;, which was a direct follow-up to the 1998 film. Ziering replaced Matthew Broderick, who portrayed Nick Tatopolous in the film.

In 2006, Ziering produced, directed and starred in the short film &quot;Man vs. Monday&quot;, which won the Audience Choice Award at the 2006 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival. Also in 2006, he won the Best Actor Award at the 2006 Monaco Film Festival for his portrayal of Francis in the independent film &quot;Stripped Down.&quot;

Ziering has also appeared in the television series &quot;JAG,&quot; &quot;What I Like About You,&quot; &quot;The Doctors&quot; as Erich Aldrich and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as Cameron Stewart. He also had a role in the videogame &quot;Freelancer&quot; as the protagonist, Edison Trent.
He was a celebrity dancer in 2007 on Season 4 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. His professional dance partner was Cheryl Burke, who won the competition in Season 2 with partner Drew Lachey and Season 3 with partner Emmitt Smith. Ziering made it to the semi-finals, and received a perfect score (three 10s) from the judges for one of his two dances in the round. However, it was not enough to reach the finals: he and Burke were eliminated during the results show the next day on May 15, 2007. In 2016 Burke said the experience of working with Ziering made her want to &quot;slit her wrists&quot;. She later apologized, not to Ziering, but for making a thoughtless reference to suicide. Ziering did not comment publicly on Burke&#x27;s comments beyond re-tweeting a message from a former co-worker that praised him as a great person to be around.

On June 18, 2007, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Ziering had auditioned the previous week for the opportunity to succeed Bob Barker as host of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. The job ultimately went to Drew Carey. Ziering&#x27;s ex-wife, Nikki, was a model on the show from 1999 to 2002.

In May, 2013, it was announced that Ziering would be performing with Chippendales as a celebrity guest star for four weeks at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

In 2015, he appeared on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; on NBC.

In 2018, he competed on &quot;Worst Cooks in America: Celebrity Edition&quot;.

In 2019, Ziering was cast as Blue Devil in the DC Universe series &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;. The show ran for only one season, though it was positively received by critics and audiences.

==Personal life==
Ziering married &quot;Playboy&quot; model Nikki Schieler in July 1997. She converted to Judaism before marrying him. They filed for divorce in February 2002, citing irreconcilable differences. Nikki has said that the separation was contentious and she was not given any support or help moving out; a spokesperson for Ziering stated Nikki was &quot;compensated above and beyond the prenup&quot;.

On February 3, 2010, Ziering announced his engagement to Erin Ludwig. The couple married at a ceremony in Newport Beach, California, on May 28, 2010. They have two daughters, Mia Loren (b. April 25, 2011) and Penna Mae (b. April 25, 2013). On October 31, 2019, Ziering announced that the couple had separated. The divorce was finalized October 4, 2022.

Ziering was involved in an altercation with a group of mini-bike riders in Los Angeles December 31, 2023. Ziering reported on social media that both he and his daughter, Penna, who was in the car when the group attacked her father, were uninjured.

<doc id="221724" wikidata="Q5508961" url="?curid=221724" title="Fundamental justice">
<text>In Canadian and New Zealand law, fundamental justice is the fairness underlying the administration of justice and its operation. The principles of fundamental justice are specific legal principles that command &quot;significant societal consensus&quot; as &quot;fundamental to the way in which the legal system ought fairly to operate&quot;, per &quot;R v Malmo-Levine&quot;. These principles may stipulate basic procedural rights afforded to anyone facing an adjudicative process or procedure that affects fundamental rights and freedoms, and certain substantive standards related to the rule of law that regulate the actions of the state (e.g., the rule against unclear or vague laws).

The degree of protection dictated by these standards and procedural rights vary in accordance with the precise context, involving a contextual analysis of the affected person&#x27;s interests. In other words, the more a person&#x27;s rights or interests are adversely affected, the more procedural or substantive protections must be afforded to that person in order to respect the principles of fundamental justice. A legislative or administrative framework that respects the principles of fundamental justice, as such, must be fundamentally fair to the person affected, but does not necessarily have to strike the &quot;right balance&quot; between individual and societal interests in general.

The term is used in the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; and the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and also the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Fundamental justice, although closely associated with, is not to be confused with the concepts of due process, natural justice, and Wednesbury unreasonableness.

==Canadian Bill of Rights==
In written law, the term &quot;fundamental justice&quot; can be traced back at least to 1960, when the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; was brought into force by the Diefenbaker government. Specifically, section 2(e) of the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; stated that everyone has &quot;the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations.&quot; According to the legal scholar Walter Tarnopolsky, the wording of the clause sparked some controversy among those drafting the Bill.

Some wanted the words &quot;natural justice&quot; in the place of &quot;fundamental justice,&quot; as &quot;natural justice&quot; was indeed a more common phrase with judges and authors. &quot;Fundamental justice&quot; was a more obscure alternative with these figures (other such alternatives include &quot;universal justice&quot;). Still, &quot;fundamental justice&quot; was chosen, and in the case &quot;Duke v. The Queen&quot; (1972), it was ruled that fundamental justice was, for the purposes of this case, merely equivalent to natural justice. The author, Chief Justice Fauteux, did say that he was not trying &quot;to formulate any final definition.&quot;

Unlike the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which was added to the Constitution of Canada in 1982, the Bill of Rights is not a constitutional instrument but rather an ordinary statute. Still, the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; remains in effect, and its guarantee of the &quot;determination&quot; of one&#x27;s &quot;rights and obligations&quot; through fundamental justice is not precisely duplicated in the Charter. While the term &quot;fundamental justice&quot; &quot;does&quot; appear in section 7 of the Charter, this is to limit the rights to life, liberty and security of the person. Hence, in the 1985 Supreme Court of Canada case &quot;Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration&quot;, half of the Court found section 2(e) of the Bill of Rights still has a role to play in Canadian law, and they used it to find in favour of the rights claimants.

Justice Jean Beetz, writing for this half of the Court, noted that section 26 of the Charter states that rights outside the Charter are not invalid, and hence the Bill of Rights still has a role to play in Canadian law. Beetz went on to find that in this case, refugees had been denied hearings, and thus their section 2(e) and fundamental justice rights were infringed. The other half of the Court also found in favour of the claimants, but relied instead on section 7 of the Charter.

Later that same year, in &quot;MacBain v. Lederman&quot;, the Federal Court of Appeal used section 2(e) of the Bill of Rights, and not the Charter, to invalidate parts of the Human Rights Code on the grounds that they could insert bias into a process to determine &quot;rights and obligations.&quot;

==Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms==

Since the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; was an ordinary statute, it was not until 1982 when the term fundamental justice was first constitutionalized. The phrase was included in section 7 of the new &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which asserted that &quot;Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.&quot;

To limit the rights to life, liberty and security of the person, the authors of the Charter specifically chose the term &quot;fundamental justice&quot; over &quot;due process&quot; because they believed the term &quot;fundamental justice&quot; would still be interpreted to mean conventional &quot;natural justice&quot;. &quot;Due process&quot; was rejected because in the United States, use of that term in the constitution led to judges expanding its meaning (&quot;see Lochner era&quot;) in ways the Canadian government felt would be undesirable. As constitutional scholar Peter Hogg points out in his book &quot;Constitutional Law of Canada&quot;, the new wording of section 7 removed the context of the &quot;fair hearing&quot; found in the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, which meant the definition of fundamental justice was now ambiguous and could still be further developed by Canadian courts. This is indeed what happened; since the 1985 Supreme Court decision &quot;Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act&quot;, the meaning of the words &quot;fundamental justice&quot; in section 7 has been greatly expanded and encompasses much more than mere procedural rights.

===Section 24===
The term fundamental justice might have some meaning in Charter case law even outside section 7. In the 2003 Charter case &quot;Doucet-Boudreau&quot;, some Supreme Court justices wished to narrow the scope of the remedial section 24 by citing &quot;fundamental justice&quot;. In this case, a lower-court judge, after having found the claimants&#x27; section 23 rights were violated, used section 24 to demand that the government, while working to repair the infringement of the right, continue to report to him &quot;after&quot; his ruling. Some Supreme Court justices felt this was an unconstitutional breach of fundamental justice because the judicial order was not clear enough to the government. However, these justices formed the minority of the panel, and the earlier decision was upheld.

Section 24.(1) reads: &quot;&quot;Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances&quot;.&quot; A judicial dilemma arises, however, when courts acting under the rule of law fail to guarantee &quot;access to justice&quot; to applicants seeking review of erroneous lower court decisions.

The principles of fundamental justice of which s. 7 [of the Charter] speaks, though not identical to the duty of fairness elucidated in Baker infra, are the same principles underlying that duty. As Professor Hogg has said, &quot;The common law rules [of procedural fairness] are in fact basic tenets of the legal system, and they have evolved in response to the same values and objectives as s. 7.&quot;

In &quot;Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration&quot;, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at pp. 212–13, Wilson J. recognized that the principles of fundamental justice demand, at a minimum, compliance with the common law requirements of procedural fairness. Section 7 protects substantive as well as procedural rights: Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra. Insofar as procedural rights are concerned, the common law doctrine summarized in Baker infra, properly recognizes the ingredients of fundamental justice. [ Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, para. 113; see also: Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 ].

Access to justice is therefore a democratic safeguard guaranteed by various Charter prerogatives in line with principles of Fundamental Justice which the courts cannot deny for reasons involving &quot;budgetary concerns&quot;. In Singh supra, at p. 218, Wilson J. speaking for the three members of the Court who addressed the Charter ...doubted that utilitarian consideration[s] ... [could] constitute a justification for a limitation on the rights set out in the Charter (emphasis added). The reason behind Wilson J.&#x27;s scepticism was that the guarantees of the Charter would be illusory if they could be ignored because it was administratively convenient to do so. [ Ref re Remuneration of Judges of the Prov. Court of P.E.I.; Ref re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the Prov. Court of P.E.I., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, para. 281 ].

<doc id="221725" wikidata="Q592524" url="?curid=221725" title="Don Cherry">
<text>Donald Stewart Cherry (born February 5, 1934) is a Canadian former ice hockey player, coach, and television commentator. He played one game in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Boston Bruins, and later coached the team for five seasons after concluding a playing career in the American Hockey League, leading the team to four division titles and two appearances in the Stanley Cup Finals.

From 1986 to 2019, Cherry co-hosted &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;—a segment aired during CBC&#x27;s Saturday-night NHL broadcast &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, with Ron MacLean. Nicknamed Grapes, he is known for his outspoken manner and opinions, and his flamboyant dress. By the 2018–19 NHL season, Cherry and MacLean had hosted &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; for 33 seasons. From 1984 to 2019, Cherry hosted &quot;Grapevine&quot;, a short-form radio segment with fellow sportscaster Brian Williams. He created and starred in the direct-to-video series &quot;Don Cherry&#x27;s Rock&#x27;Em Sock&#x27;em Hockey&quot; from 1989 to 2018.

In 2004, Cherry was voted by viewers as the seventh-greatest Canadian of all time in the CBC miniseries &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;. In March 2010, his life was dramatized in a two-part CBC movie, &quot;Keep Your Head Up, Kid: The Don Cherry Story&quot;, based on a script written by his son, Timothy Cherry. In March 2012, CBC aired a sequel, &quot;The Wrath of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II&quot;.

Cherry has expressed controversial political views for which he has faced criticism, including remarks he made regarding Canada&#x27;s lack of support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and denying climate change. In November 2019, Cherry was fired by Sportsnet from &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; for making controversial comments about Canadian immigrants during his show.

==Early life and family==
Cherry was born in Kingston, Ontario, to Delmar (Del) and Maude Cherry. His paternal grandfather, Sub/Cst. John T. (Jack) Cherry, was an original member of the North-West Mounted Police (now Royal Canadian Mounted Police), and a Great Lakes ship captain. His maternal grandfather, Richard Palamountain, was a British orphan of Cornish parentage who emigrated to Canada as one of the Home Children. The name, Palamountain, is a corruption of the Cornish language &quot;pol-mun-tyr&quot; meaning &quot;pool by the mineral land&quot;. Palamountain was also a veteran of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Cherry&#x27;s father Del was an amateur athlete and worked as an electrician with the Canadian Steamship Lines. On the March 15, 2008, edition of Coach&#x27;s Corner, Cherry wore the green and gold colours of County Kerry, Ireland. In his segment following the game, he claimed ancestry from that region. Cherry&#x27;s younger brother, Dick Cherry played hockey at various levels, including two seasons in the National Hockey League with the Philadelphia Flyers.

In his first year with the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, he met his future wife Rosemarie (Rose) Cherry &quot;née&quot; Madelyn Martini (born 1935 in Hershey, Pennsylvania). Rose was hugely influential in Don&#x27;s life—because of Don&#x27;s minor-league hockey lifestyle, they moved 53 times; they rarely had decent housing or furnishings, and Don was often away playing during major events, such as the birth of their daughter and first child, Cindy Cherry. Six years after Cindy&#x27;s birth, Rose gave birth to son Tim Cherry. When Tim needed a kidney transplant at age 13, Cindy donated one of hers. As of 2006, the two lived across the street from each other, around the corner from their father, in Mississauga.

Rose died of liver cancer on June 1, 1997, and in honour of her perseverance, Don created Rose Cherry&#x27;s Home for Kids. Her name has motivated Cherry to always wear a rose on his lapel. Cherry contributed to developing Rose Cherry&#x27;s Home for Kids which has since been renamed to The Darling Home for Kids, in Milton, Ontario. The Paramount Fine Foods Centre in Mississauga, is located on Rose Cherry Place, a street named for his late wife.

In 1999, Don married his second wife, Luba.

==Playing career==

Cherry played junior hockey with the Barrie Flyers and the Windsor Spitfires in the Ontario Hockey Association. Cherry won the Memorial Cup while playing defence in Barrie in 1953. He dropped out of high school, and in 1954 he signed with the American Hockey League&#x27;s (AHL) Hershey Bears.

Cherry had a long playing career in professional minor hockey, and in 1955 played his only NHL game when the Boston Bruins called him up during the playoffs. According to Cherry, a baseball injury suffered in the off-season kept him from making the NHL, despite his almost 20 years playing in the minor leagues. He retired as a player in 1970, but came out of retirement two years later to play 19 final games with the Rochester Americans. Cherry won the Calder Cup championship (AHL) four times—1960 with the Springfield Indians, and 1965, 1966, 1968 with Rochester. He also won the Lester Patrick Cup, the Western Hockey League Championship, with the Vancouver Canucks in 1969.

===Career statistics===
===Regular season and playoffs===
==Coaching career==
After the end of the 1968–69 season, his playing career was essentially over. Cherry struggled for a time as a Cadillac salesman and a construction worker. He worked as a house painter earning $2 per hour.

In the middle of the 1971–72 season, Cherry became the coach of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Rochester Americans. The following year, the title of General Manager was added. In his third season behind the bench, Cherry was voted the league&#x27;s Coach of the Year.

===Boston Bruins===
After his three-year stint in Rochester, he was promoted to the NHL as head coach of the Boston Bruins for the 1974–75 season. The Bruins were coming off a successful run of two Stanley Cups and three first-place finishes, but after Cherry&#x27;s first season as coach the team would see the exit of superstars Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito.

Cherry quickly developed a reputation for being an eccentric, flamboyant coach who strongly encouraged physical play among his players. According to Cherry, he moulded the Bruins&#x27; playing style after that of his dog, Blue, a feisty bullterrier. While the team had been known for Orr and Esposito who were highly skilled scorers, the 1975–76 Bruins started the season in brief slump in part due to Orr&#x27;s knee injury that saw him play only ten games, plus Orr would become a free agent at the end of the season. Cherry remade the team with enforcers and grinders which became known as the &quot;lunch-pail gang&quot; (or &quot;lunch pail A.C.&quot;) and &quot;the Big Bad Bruins&quot;, with Esposito and Carol Vadnais being traded to the New York Rangers for Brad Park and Jean Ratelle, as Esposito disagreed with Cherry&#x27;s coaching including having a disinclination to backcheck. This approach of &quot;balance over brilliance&quot; rejuvenated the Bruins, in particular the careers of Park and Ratelle, as they continued to be one of the NHL&#x27;s best teams during the latter half of the 1970s, capturing the Adams division title four straight seasons from 1975–76 through 1978–79, with Cherry winning the Jack Adams Award (NHL coach of the year) for the 1975 season. In the 1977–78 season, Cherry coached the Bruins team to an NHL record of 11 players with 20 goals or more on a single team.

The Bruins were able to defeat the rough Philadelphia Flyers twice in the playoffs under Cherry&#x27;s tenure. The Bruins made the Stanley Cup finals twice, both times losing to their arch-rivals, the Montreal Canadiens, in both 1977 and 1978. The late 1970s Canadiens were one of the most dominant teams in the NHL, with three of their eight regular losses in the 1976–77 season coming at the hands of the Bruins. In the 1979 semi-final playoff series against the Canadiens, Cherry&#x27;s Bruins pushed the series to the limit but they were undone by a late penalty in the seventh game. Up by a goal with less than three minutes left in the seventh game, the Bruins were called for having too many men on the ice, which he blamed on himself, saying later &quot;The guy couldn&#x27;t have heard me yell. I grabbed two other guys trying to go over the boards. That would have made eight on the ice.&quot; The Canadiens&#x27; Guy Lafleur scored the tying goal on the subsequent power play, and ultimately the Canadiens won the game in overtime. Montreal went on to defeat the New York Rangers for their fourth straight Cup title. Cherry, who had an uneasy relationship with Bruins General Manager Harry Sinden, was fired by the Bruins afterward.

===Colorado Rockies===
Cherry went on to coach the Colorado Rockies in the 1979-80 season. Under his tenure, the Rockies adopted the motto &quot;Come to the fights and watch a Rockies game break out!&quot; and the slogan could be seen on billboards all over Denver throughout the season.

However, as he later admitted, his outspokenness and feuding with Rockies general manager Ray Miron did not endear Cherry to management. While Cherry did much to motivate the players, goaltending was still the team&#x27;s weakness as Miron refused to replace Hardy Åström, whom Cherry dubbed &quot;The Swedish Sieve&quot;. Cherry recalled one game where his players had taken ten shots on goal without scoring, but Åström then conceded a goal from the opponent&#x27;s first shot and so was yanked from net.

In a late-season game in Chicago, the Blackhawks scored the game-winning goal while Mike McEwen, a favourite of the Rockies owners, was on the ice. When McEwen returned to the bench, Cherry grabbed him by the jersey and shook him. McEwen left the team for several days and did not return until after meeting with Miron and the club owners. Cherry&#x27;s belief, stated later, was that the owners had promised McEwen that Cherry would be fired after the season.

The Rockies finished with a league-worst 19–48–13 record, also the worst single-season mark of Cherry&#x27;s coaching career. He was fired six weeks after the season ended.

===Team Canada, Saskatoon Blues, Mississauga IceDogs===
Internationally, Cherry was an assistant coach for Team Canada at the 1976 Canada Cup and was head coach for Canada&#x27;s team at the 1981 World Championships in Gothenburg, Sweden.

In 1983 Cherry agreed to become the new head coach of the Saskatoon Blues, Bill Hunter&#x27;s proposed relocation of the St. Louis Blues to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. However, the NHL&#x27;s Board of Governors rejected the move on May 18, 1983, and the Blues remained in St. Louis.

Cherry was involved with the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Mississauga IceDogs as part-owner from 1998—2002 and as the coach from 2001—2002. As owner and general manager, he gained notoriety by refusing to take part in the CHL import draft, and by only playing North American-born players. The IceDogs&#x27; first three seasons were difficult ones with the team winning a total of 16 games combined. Cherry took over coaching duties in the fourth season after firing Rick Vaive and hiring himself as replacement. During Cherry&#x27;s one season as head coach of the IceDogs, the team managed 11 victories (only a slight improvement) and failed to make the playoffs for the fourth straight year. Cherry drew some criticism for his sudden decision to allow European-born players onto the IceDogs line-up during the one season he coached the team.

==Broadcasting career==

After the Colorado Rockies failed to qualify for the 1980 Stanley Cup playoffs, Cherry was hired as a studio analyst for CBC&#x27;s playoff coverage that spring, working alongside host Dave Hodge. CBC hired him full-time in 1981 as a colour commentator, but he didn&#x27;t last long in that role due to his tendency to openly cheer for one of the teams playing, especially the Boston Bruins or Toronto Maple Leafs. Instead, &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; was created, a segment that appeared in the first intermission on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, with Dave Hodge. In 1986, Hodge was replaced by Ron MacLean.

From 1984 to 2019, Cherry co-hosted &quot;Don Cherry&#x27;s Grapeline&quot; with Brian Williams, first on CFRB radio in Toronto and its sister stations, moving in 1994 to The FAN 590 and the Sportsnet Radio network. At its peak, the show was carried on over 100 stations across Canada and on several stations in the United States.

For several years he also hosted his half-hour interview show, &quot;Don Cherry&#x27;s Grapevine&quot;, which began on Hamilton&#x27;s CHCH-TV in the 1980s before moving to TSN. His loud, outspoken nature became notorious, and his shows are described as &quot;game analysis, cultural commentary and playful parrying with host Ron MacLean.&quot;

Cherry also hosted a syndicated weekly television show called &quot;Don Cherry&#x27;s This Week in Hockey&quot; during the 1987–88 NHL season. It featured highlights from the previous week&#x27;s NHL games. The highlight of each show was when Cherry awarded a Black and Decker cordless drill to the player who levied the &quot;hit of the week&quot; (called the &quot;Drill of the Week&quot; to tie into the cordless drill giveaway).

Branching out from his &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; duties, Cherry began to release a series of videos called &quot;Don Cherry&#x27;s Rock&#x27;Em Sock&#x27;em Hockey&quot; in 1989.

In 1989, he referred to Finnish-born Winnipeg Jets assistant coach Alpo Suhonen as &quot;some kind of dog food&quot;, triggering the threat of a lawsuit from Jets owner Barry Shenkarow.

The 15th-anniversary video of &quot;Rock&#x27;Em Sock&#x27;em Hockey&quot; was released in 2003, with a &#x27;Best Of&#x27; released in 2005.

In January 2004, during &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;, Cherry claimed that players who wore visors were more likely to commit high-sticking infractions. He also said, &quot;Most of the guys that wear them are Europeans and French [Canadian] guys&quot;. This statement triggered an investigation by the federal Official Languages Commissioner and protests by French Canadians. CBC consequently imposed a seven-second delay on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. In a subsequent analysis of 82 NHL games for 12 days, CBC Sports Online discovered that high-sticking infractions were committed far more often by players not wearing visors, at a rate of nearly 2 to 1.

Cherry returned to the &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; for the 2005–06 NHL season without the seven-second delay.

For the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, NBC decided to feature Cherry in its intermission coverage, a rare appearance on American television. He was partnered with Bill Clement and Brett Hull and it did not conflict with his usual role on CBC as he appeared on NBC during the second intermission.

In May 2008, ESPN announced that Cherry was joining Barry Melrose as a commentator for the remainder of the 2008 NHL Playoffs. He provided pre-game analysis for the conference finals, pre- and post-game analysis for the Stanley Cup finals, and appeared on ESPNews and ESPN Radio. ESPN also announced that he would donate his fees to the Humane Society.

Cherry&#x27;s commentary was usually peppered with quotables and catchphrases like &quot;All you kids out there...,&quot; unrestrained affection for his favourite players (including Steve Yzerman and Kingston native Doug Gilmour, whom Cherry affectionately referred to as &quot;Dougie&quot; and once kissed on-air in a famous TV gag), and overall political incorrectness. Known for his signature style which included colourful jackets, shirts, and ties he wore during the &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; segment of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;.

===Removal from &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;===
On November 9, 2019, during &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;, Cherry complained that Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans and do not wear remembrance poppies. He said, &quot;You people that come here... you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that... These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price.&quot; These comments were widely condemned, with some calling them racist. The distributor of those poppies in Canada, The Royal Canadian Legion, officially denounced those statements saying, &quot;Mr. Cherry’s personal opinion was hurtful, divisive and in no way condoned by the Legion.&quot; Sportsnet apologized for the remarks, stating that his comments were discriminatory and offensive, and that they &quot;do not represent our values and what we stand for as a network.&quot; His co-host, Ron MacLean, also apologized via Twitter, expressing regret for his actions and for allowing Cherry to make the comments. The NHL subsequently released a statement on Cherry&#x27;s comments saying &quot;the comments made last night were offensive and contrary to the values we believe in.&quot; Cherry later told the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; that he would not apologize for his comments, stating, &quot;I have had my say.&quot;

On November 10, MacLean appeared on air for the first time following the incident and opened &quot;Rogers Hometown Hockey&#x27;s&quot; broadcast with an apology: &quot;Don Cherry made remarks which were hurtful, discriminatory, which were flat out wrong. We at Sportsnet have apologized. It certainly doesn&#x27;t stand for what Sportsnet or Rogers represents. We know diversity is the strength of the country. We see it in travels with our show (&quot;Hometown Hockey&quot;) and with &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. I owe you an apology, too: that&#x27;s the big thing I want to emphasize. I sat there, did not catch it, did not respond.&quot;

The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) stated that its internal systems had been overloaded by a high number of complaints. Two days later, on November 11, Sportsnet president Bart Yabsley announced that Cherry had been fired: &quot;Following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night&#x27;s broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down.&quot; Speaking to the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, Cherry commented, &quot;I know what I said and I meant it. Everybody in Canada should wear a poppy to honour our fallen soldiers... I would have liked to continue doing &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;. The problem is if I have to watch everything I say, it isn&#x27;t &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;.&quot; He later said that if he had to do it again, he would have said &quot;everybody&quot;.

On November 16, 2019, MacLean addressed and reflected on the incident during &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, the first without Cherry, also announcing the end of &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;.

Former Boston Bruins defenceman Bobby Orr defended Cherry, calling his firing &quot;disgraceful&quot;. Colorado Avalanche forward Nazem Kadri said &quot;People maybe took it out of context a little bit. I know Grapes is a great person and am sad to see him go.&quot;

===Later career===
On November 19, 2019, Cherry released his first installment of &quot;Grapevine&quot;, this time as a podcast. During his first podcast, Cherry said he was unwilling to accept Sportsnet&#x27;s conditions for his return.

==Other ventures==
===Acting career===
As part of his fame, Cherry has also branched out into some acting roles. He was cast as Jake Nelson in the television series &quot;Power Play&quot;. Nelson was the coach of the Philadelphia team playing against the Hamilton Steelheads in the playoffs during the first season. Also, he and Ron MacLean provided voices for themselves in the animated series &quot;Zeroman&quot;, which starred Leslie Nielsen. He also appeared on an episode of &quot;Goosebumps&quot; called &quot;Don&#x27;t Go to Sleep!&quot; where he plays a hockey coach. His voice was also used in Disney&#x27;s animated feature &quot;The Wild&quot;, as a penguin curling broadcaster. He also appeared alongside the Trailer Park Boys in The Tragically Hip&#x27;s video &quot;The Darkest One&quot;. His voice was also used in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; episode &quot;Bad Ear Day&quot;, as an ice hockey game announcer.

In 2008, he also appeared on an episode of &quot;Holmes on Homes&quot;, the widely popular home improvement show. While not appearing scripted, Cherry lived in the neighbourhood and he is shown speaking with Mike Holmes about the construction business and the ongoing project at his brother-in-law&#x27;s house.

===Business and charitable work===
In 1985, the first of a chain of franchised sports bars/restaurants bearing Cherry&#x27;s name was opened in Hamilton. Cherry started as a partner in the operation and has more recently licensed his name to the chain without holding a significant ownership stake in the company. &quot;Don Cherry&#x27;s Sports Grill&quot; has locations in Ontario, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta.

Cherry created the Don Cherry Pet Rescue Foundation and donates all profits from his Simply Pets snacks line to animal charities. During the 42nd Canadian Parliament, Cherry, typically a supporter of the Conservatives made a video supporting Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful private member&#x27;s bill that sought to toughen animal cruelty laws.

==Opinions on hockey==
Cherry would often complain about players that he believed were not playing hockey the &quot;right&quot; way, and those players were usually Québécois, Swedes, Russians, or of some other background besides English-speaking Canadians. He believes that fighting is an integral part of the game as it enforces respect between teams and players, as well as being popular with the public. He has been described as &quot;a pioneer in the identity politics of sports.&quot;

Cherry has called Bobby Orr the greatest player of all time. Other favourites of his include Doug Gilmour, Vincent Lecavalier, and Cam Neely. Cherry has criticized many players for what he considers dishonourable conduct, but perhaps none more than Ulf Samuelsson, whom he considered to be an exceptionally dirty player.

Cherry has strongly criticized the direction taken by the National Hockey League in recent years, reducing fighting in favour of speed and skill. Specific rules that he criticizes include touch-up icing and the instigator rule.

He also frequently criticized players for elaborate celebrations after goals. In 2003, Cherry made headlines by criticizing then heavily publicized junior prospect Sidney Crosby for being a &quot;hot dog&quot; because of the way Crosby slid around on his knees after scoring. He also disapproved of a tricky behind-the-net goal the young star pulled off when a game was already out of reach for the team he scored on. He commented on the controversy caused by Alexander Ovechkin&#x27;s celebration after he scored his 50th goal in 2009.

Along similar lines, in 2019 he criticized the Carolina Hurricanes for their on-ice victory celebrations, calling them a &quot;bunch of jerks.&quot; The Hurricanes adopted &quot;Bunch of Jerks&quot; as a battle cry, even going as far as projecting it on the ice at PNC Arena before and after games.

Cherry is a staunch supporter of women&#x27;s hockey, and sledge hockey. In 1997, the Canadian women&#x27;s national ice hockey team paid tribute to the late Rose Cherry. Canadian Hockey chairman Bob MacKinnon thanked Cherry stating &quot;The growing popularity of the women&#x27;s game in our country owes a great deal to Don and Rose Cherry... Don has been a strong supporter of the female game since the early 1980s and continues to speak out in favour of women&#x27;s hockey. It&#x27;s a pleasure for me, as chairman of Canadian Hockey, to be a part of this tribute to Rose Cherry, who was a keen supporter of female hockey herself.&quot;

==Political views==
Over his career on television, Cherry generated significant controversy about both hockey and politics.

In 2003, Cherry made comments on his CBC segment in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On March 22, 2003, Cherry criticized Montreal fans for booing the American national anthem before a game earlier in the week. The conversation then turned to the war when Ron MacLean said &quot;everybody wants to know what you think&quot;. Cherry berated MacLean about being neutral on the war and strongly criticized the Canadian government for failing to support the U.S. in the war. Cherry appeared on the American radio program &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot; the following week, stating, &quot;You have to realize the CBC is government owned [...] You have to say the government was against [the invasion of Iraq] and I&#x27;m for it and I&#x27;m on a government program. I really thought this could be the end.&quot;

After appearing in the House of Commons of Canada on November 7, 2006, he formally stated his support for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, whom he called &quot;a grinder and a mucker&quot; by saying &quot;I give a thumbs up to Stephen Harper for sure. He supports the troops and I support the troops.&quot;

On December 7, 2010, Cherry attended an inaugural meeting of Toronto City Council, where he placed the chain of office around incoming Mayor Rob Ford&#x27;s neck. Cherry was asked to say a few remarks and he opened by stating &quot;I&#x27;m wearing pink for all the pinkos out there that ride bicycles and everything, I thought I’d get it in.&quot; He then went on to state that he had &quot;been ripped to shreds by the left-wing pinko newspapers out there&quot; and ended by saying &quot;And that&#x27;s why I say he&#x27;s gonna be the greatest mayor this city has ever, ever seen, as far as I&#x27;m concerned! And put that in your pipe, you left-wing kooks.&quot; Left-leaning councillors were critical of Cherry&#x27;s speech, and the following day some of them wore pink clothing in protest, including Joe Mihevc and Ana Bailão, who wore pink scarves while Janet Davis wore a pink suit jacket. Mihevc said, &quot;We all love Don Cherry and his comments and forcefulness in hockey games, but this is council. It’s a political arena where we make it a habit to reach out, talk to others and achieve consensus. To have that kind of, frankly, belligerence and pushing people aside, to start out this way I think is really unfortunate.&quot; Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong defended Cherry though he stated that it was &quot;A little over the top&quot; and that &quot;You take it for what it is and you shrug it off and move forward.&quot; Cherry defended his comments by stating &quot;Well, what can I tell you? Don’t invite me. You don&#x27;t invite a pit bull. If you want a pit bull, you get a pit bull.&quot; Later that month, Cherry was a guest of Rob Ford on a trip to visit Canadian troops in Afghanistan conducted by the Government of Canada, where he attended and spoke at a Christmas dinner event.

Cherry is a strong supporter of the Canadian Forces, police officers, and veterans.

In 2018, Cherry faced backlash after denying the existence of climate change and referred to people who acknowledge climate change as &quot;cuckaloos.&quot; Environment Minister Catherine McKenna responded by saying, &quot;For hockey you can turn to &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; if you want, for climate change, Canadians turn to scientists.&quot; Cherry has expressed similar views in the past such as during a 2008 &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; broadcast when he called environmental activist David Suzuki a &quot;left-wing kook.&quot;

In 2020, Cherry supported Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election.

==Accolades==
On November 14, 2005, Cherry was granted honorary membership of the Police Association of Ontario. Once an aspiring police officer, Cherry has been a longtime supporter of the police services. In his own words, &quot;This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; In June 2007, Cherry was made a Dominion Command Honorary Life Member of the Royal Canadian Legion in recognition of &quot;his longstanding and unswerving support of... Canadians in uniform&quot;. In February 2008, Cherry was awarded the Canadian Forces Medallion for Distinguished Service for &#x27;unwavering support to men and women of the Canadian Forces, honouring fallen soldiers on his CBC broadcast during &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;, a segment of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;″.

In 2004, Cherry ranked at number 7 on the CBC&#x27;s miniseries &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;. Cherry remarked that he was &quot;a good Canadian&quot;, but not the greatest Canadian, and that he was personally rooting for fellow Kingston resident, John A. Macdonald.

In 2016, Cherry, along with his &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; co-host Ron MacLean, received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

<text>A restraining order or protective order is an order used by a court to protect a person in a situation often involving alleged domestic violence, child abuse and neglect, assault, harassment, stalking, or sexual assault. 

Restraining and personal protection order laws vary from one jurisdiction to another but all establish who can file for an order, what protection or relief a person can get from such an order, and how the order will be enforced. The court will order the adverse party to refrain from certain actions or require compliance with certain provisions. Failure to comply is a violation of the order which can result in the arrest and prosecution of the offender. Violations in some jurisdictions may also constitute criminal or civil contempt of court.

==Restraining order provisions==
All protective order statutes permit the court to instruct an alleged abuser to stay a certain distance away from someone, such as their home, workplace or school (&quot;stay away&quot; provisions), and not to contact them. Alleged victims generally may also request the court to order that all contact, whether it be by telephone, notes, mail, fax, email, text, social media, or delivery of flowers, gifts, or drinks be prohibited (&quot;no contact&quot; provisions). Courts can also instruct an alleged abuser to not hurt or threaten someone (&quot;cease abuse&quot; provisions) known as no violent contact orders. The no-violent contact order statutes from the court may allow the alleged abuser to maintain their current living situation with the alleged victim or have contact with them.

Some states also allow the court to order the alleged abuser to pay temporary support or continue to make mortgage payments on a home owned by both people (&quot;support&quot; provisions), to award sole use of a home or car owned by both people (&quot;exclusive use&quot; provisions), or to pay for medical costs or property damage caused by the alleged abuser (&quot;restitution&quot; provisions). Some courts might also be able to instruct the alleged abuser to turn over any firearms and ammunition they have (&quot;relinquish firearms&quot; provisions), attend a batterers&#x27; treatment program, appear for regular drug tests, or start alcohol or drug abuse counselling. Its issuance is sometimes called a &quot;de facto divorce&quot;.

==Burden of proof and misuse==
The standard of proof required to obtain a restraining order can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but it is generally lower than the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt required in criminal trials. Many US states—such as Oregon and Pennsylvania—use a standard of preponderance of the evidence. Other states use different standards, such as Wisconsin, which require that restraining orders be based on &quot;reasonable grounds&quot;.

Judges have some incentives to err on the side of granting restraining orders. If a judge grants a restraining order against someone who might not warrant it, typically the only repercussion is that the defendant might appeal the order. If, however, the judge denies a restraining order and the plaintiff is killed or injured, poor publicity and an enraged community reaction may harm the jurist&#x27;s career.

Colorado&#x27;s statute inverts the standard court procedures and due process, providing that after the court issues an &quot;ex parte&quot; order, the defendant must &quot;appear before the court at a specific time and date and . . . show cause, if any, why said temporary civil protection order should not be made permanent&quot;. That is, Colorado courts place the burden of proof on the accused to establish his or her innocence, rather than requiring the accuser to prove his or her case. Hawaii similarly requires the defendant to prove his or her own innocence.

The low burden of proof for restraining orders has led to some high-profile cases involving stalkers of celebrities obtaining restraining orders against their targets. For example, in 2005 a New Mexico judge issued a restraining order against New York City-based TV host David Letterman after a woman made claims of abuse and harassment, including allegations that Letterman had spoken to her via coded messages on his TV show. The judge later admitted that he granted the restraining order not on the merits of the case, but because the petitioner had completely filled out the required paperwork.

Some attorneys have criticized the use of restraining orders on the theory that parties to a divorce may file such orders to gain tactical advantages, rather than out of a legitimate fear of harm. Liz Mandarano, an attorney who specializes in family and matrimonial law, speculates that divorce attorneys are incentivized to push for restraining orders because such orders force all communications to go through the parties&#x27; lawyers and may prolong the legal struggle. Some attorneys offer to have restraining orders dropped in exchange for financial concessions in such proceedings.

==Effectiveness==
Experts disagree on whether restraining orders are effective in preventing further harassment. A 2010 analysis published in the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law&quot; reviewed 15 U.S. studies of restraining order effectiveness, and concluded that restraining orders &quot;can serve a useful role in threat management&quot;. However, a 2002 analysis of 32 U.S. studies found that restraining orders are violated an average of 40 percent of the time and are perceived as being &quot;followed by worse events&quot; almost 21 percent of the time, and concluded that &quot;evidence of [restraining orders&#x27;] relative efficacy is lacking&quot;, and that they may pose some degree of risk. Other studies have found that restraining orders offer little or no assurance against future interpersonal violence. A large America-wide telephone survey conducted in 1998 found that, of stalking victims who obtained a restraining order, only 30% of these orders kept the stalker away.

Threat management experts are often suspicious of restraining orders, believing they may escalate or enrage stalkers. In his 1997 book &quot;The Gift of Fear&quot;, American security specialist Gavin de Becker characterized restraining orders as &quot;homework assignments police give to women to prove they&#x27;re really committed to getting away from their pursuers,&quot; and said they &quot;clearly serve police and prosecutors,&quot; but &quot;they do not always serve victims&quot;. The Independent Women’s Forum decries them as &quot;lulling women into a false sense of security,&quot; and in its Family Legal Guide, the American Bar Association warns “a court order might even add to the alleged offender&#x27;s rage&quot;.

&quot;Castle Rock v. Gonzales&quot;, , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled, 7–2, that a town and its police department could not be sued under for failing to enforce a restraining order, which had led to the murder of a woman&#x27;s three children by her estranged husband.

Both parties must be informed of the restraining order for it to go into effect. Law enforcement may have trouble serving the order, making the petition unproductive. A study in the United States found that some counties had 91 percent of restraining orders non-served. A temporary order of restraint (&quot;ex parte&quot; order) is in effect for two weeks before a court settles the terms of the order, but it is still not in effect until the alleged abuser is served.

==Gender of parties==
Restraining orders most commonly protect a woman against a male alleged abuser. A California study found that 72% of restraining orders active in the state at the time protected a woman against an alleged male abuser. The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence uses female pronouns to refer to petitioners and male pronouns to refer to abusers due to the fact that most petitioners are women and most alleged abusers are men.

==Jurisdictions==
===United Kingdom===
====England====

In English law, a non-molestation order may be granted under Section 42 of the Family Law Act 1996. Non-molestation orders are a type of injunction used to protect an individual from intimidation or harassment. Breaching a non-molestation order is a criminal offence. Under the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004, cohabiting same-sex couples are able to seek a non-molestation order. Non-molestation orders sought for protection from domestic violence qualify for legal aid regardless of the applicant&#x27;s income.

===United States===
Federal law requires that all states give &quot;full faith and credit&quot; to every portion of a restraining order issued by any state provided that certain minimum due process requirements are met. Thus a state with very lax standards for issuing a restraining order may enter such a protective order, and every state and federal territory would be required to adhere to every provision. Federal law prohibits any person who is subject to a state protective order from possessing a firearm, provided that the protected party is an intimate partner, meaning a spouse or former spouse, or a person with whom the protected party has had a child. Violating a restraining order is a deportable offense.

Some states (e.g. Mississippi) may also call a restraining order a peace bond and are similar to ASBO laws in the UK. Minnesota law provides for an order for protection (OFP) and a harassment restraining order (HRO).

Many jurisdictions offer a simplified process for filing a civil complaint for unrepresented litigants. For example, in North Carolina, &quot;pro se&quot; litigants can file a 50B (also called a DVPO, for domestic violence protective order) complaint with the clerk of court.

====Types====
In the United States, every state has some form of domestic violence restraining order law, and many states also have specific restraining order laws for stalking and sexual assault. In the US, each state has its own restraining order laws, but they tend to be divided into five main types. Not every state will have every type of restraining order on the books. 

A domestic violence restraining order generally protects only parties deemed to be in some form of &quot;domestic&quot; relationship which may, depending on the statute, include a family, household, intimate, or sexual relationship.

A sexual assault restraining order specifically protects a victim of sexual assault regardless of what relationship may or may not exist between petitioner and respondent. If the state has no sexual assault restraining order statute, the victim may still qualify for a domestic violence restraining order if the sexual assault occurred in the context of a domestic relationship or if the statute is written sufficiently broad. In such cases, sexual assault survivors can sometimes qualify for domestic violence restraining orders because any act of sexual intercourse between petitioner and respondent, even during rape, legally establishes the required sexually intimate relationship.

Harassment and stalking restraining orders also generally do not require any specific relationship to exist or not exist between the parties, but also may not be available in all states. These types of restraining orders also generally require at least two instances of, respectively, harassment or stalking to qualify.

In many cases, one statute may cover more than one type of restraining order. For example, what is called a harassment restraining order in Wisconsin also specifically includes cases of sexual assault and stalking.

In California, domestic violence restraining orders are issued under Family Code Section 6200, et. seq. The California courts have designed domestic violence restraining orders to be accessible to the public so as not to require a lawyer to obtain or defend against one.

Finally, an extreme risk restraining order is a form of US restraining order, currently used in 13 states. Other forms of restraining order will sometimes order firearms restrictions as a part of a larger injunction intended to protect a specific individual. But with an extreme risk restraining order, the sole focus is on the firearms restrictions. It is sought when household members or police believe a particular individual is at risk to use firearms to harm themselves or others. If a court agrees, the person can have their firearms taken away. This type of restraining order is not intended to protect a specific individual but rather the community at large from someone believed to be a danger for gun violence. It has been cited as a possible tool to help prevent mass shootings such as the Orlando nightclub shooting.

===Czech Republic===
A domestic violence restraining order in the Czech Republic may be issued by a police officer or by a court.

Any police officer has authority under the Police Act to issue restraining order prohibiting a person from entering common dwelling and nearby areas and from contacting the threatened person. Such restraining order is valid for a period of ten days. In case that the threatened person files for court restraining order, the police restraining order remains valid until court renders decision.

A court may issue a domestic violence or stalking restraining order based on application of threatened person for a period of up to one month. This may later be extended if the threatened person files for extension. Extension is possible for necessary period of time, but no more than six months in total.

Breaching of restraining order is a separate crime punishable by up to two years of imprisonment.

<doc id="221733" wikidata="Q309019" url="?curid=221733" title="Unfinished Tales">
<text>Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth is a collection of stories and essays by J. R. R. Tolkien that were never completed during his lifetime, but were edited by his son Christopher Tolkien and published in 1980. Many of the tales within are retold in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, albeit in modified forms; the work also contains a summary of the events of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; told from a less personal perspective.

The collection received a cautious welcome from scholars and critics. They noted Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s warning that a good knowledge of the background was needed to gain much from the stories. Others noted that the stories were among the best of Tolkien&#x27;s writing; Warren Dunn expressed a wish for the whole of the history in such a format. The book, with its commentary, was commercially successful, indicating a market for more of Tolkien&#x27;s work and leading to the 12-volume &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;.

On &quot;The Quest of Erebor&quot; in Part Three, Christine Barkley comments that the perspective is the knowledgeable Gandalf&#x27;s, contrasting sharply with the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins&#x27;s narrower point of view in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Peter Jackson used the story to enrich the narrative for his 2013 film &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot;.

== Overview ==

Unlike &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, also published posthumously (in 1977), for which the narrative fragments were modified to connect them into a consistent and coherent work, the &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names changed (the author having had a confusing habit of trying out different names for a character while writing a draft). Thus some of these are incomplete stories, while others are collections of information about Middle-earth. Each tale is followed by a long series of notes explaining inconsistencies and obscure points.

As with &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, Tolkien&#x27;s son Christopher edited and published &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; before he had finished his study of the materials in his father&#x27;s archive. &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; provides more detailed information about characters, events and places mentioned only briefly in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Versions of such tales, including the origins of Gandalf and the other Istari (Wizards), the death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring in the Gladden Fields, and the founding of the kingdom of Rohan, help expand knowledge about Middle-earth.

The commercial success of &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; demonstrated that the demand for Tolkien&#x27;s stories several years after his death was not only present but growing. Encouraged by the result, Christopher Tolkien embarked upon the more ambitious twelve-volume work entitled &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, which encompasses nearly the entire corpus of his father&#x27;s writings about Middle-earth.

== Analysis ==

=== General ===

The scholar Paul H. Kocher, reviewing &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, noted that all the stories are linked to either &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, &quot;Akallabeth&quot; or &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and extensively annotated, mainly by Christopher Tolkien. In Kocher&#x27;s view, the stories contain &quot;some of Tolkien&#x27;s best writing&quot; (and he summarized them in some detail), though he found much of interest in the editorial material also. He noted the revised map with the additional place names used in the tales, and that the book does not address Tolkien&#x27;s poetry.

The independent scholar Douglas C. Kane writes that Christopher Tolkien chose to include not just narrative tales, despite the book&#x27;s title, but &quot;a taste of some of the descriptive and historical underpinnings of those heretofore uncharted vistas&quot;, and that indeed he suggested he might &quot;dive even deeper into the history of his father&#x27;s legendarium&quot;, as he eventually did with his 12-volume &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Corey Olsen notes that Christopher Tolkien chose to present the incomplete tales as they were, adding a commentary to help readers grasp how they fitted in to his father&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium. Olson comments that the book&#x27;s commercial success demonstrated the existence of a market for more of Tolkien&#x27;s writings, opening up a route to publication of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;.

The Christian philosopher Peter Kreeft wrote in &quot;Christianity &amp; Literature&quot; that many readers had felt disappointed by &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, as some had felt about &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. Perry Bramlett adds that the book is not for the reader new to Tolkien, nor even one who has read only &quot;The Hobbit&quot; &quot;or perhaps some or even all of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot; He notes Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s warning that the stories &quot;constitute no whole&quot; and that much of the content &quot;will be found unrewarding&quot; to those without a good knowledge of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. More positively, he cites David Bratman&#x27;s comment that much of it is as well-crafted as any of Tolkien&#x27;s writings, and that readers who found &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; &quot;a little too high and distant&quot; would welcome it.

The science fiction author Warren Dunn, writing in 1993, described the book as engaging, and that every section contained &quot;something of interest&quot;, but he cautioned that it required &quot;an intimate knowledge&quot; of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and its appendices &quot;for full enjoyment&quot; of the book. He commented that &quot;I really do wish we could have seen the whole history like this, even if it took up twelve volumes to get through the first, second and third ages before the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;!&quot;

=== &quot;The Quest of Erebor&quot; ===

Christine Barkley, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, notes that the point of view in &quot;The Quest of Erebor&quot; is Gandalf&#x27;s, sharply contrasting with Bilbo&#x27;s far less well-informed point of view in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. That book, she states, uses a third-person, limited-knowledge narrator, supposedly written from Bilbo&#x27;s diary after the adventure. Where Bilbo is interested in food and comfort, and sometimes other familiar things such as riddles, she writes, Gandalf is concerned with defending the West against the Shadow (Sauron). Further, the &quot;Quest&quot; actually pretends to be Frodo&#x27;s memory of a conversation he had with Gandalf, rather than Gandalf actually writing, so there is uncertainty about how much of what Gandalf said may have been recorded. And when Frodo asks if he has now heard the full story, Gandalf replies &quot;Of course not&quot;, so the narration is explicitly incomplete. From the reader&#x27;s point of view, the point of the story is to explain how &quot;The Hobbit&quot; fits into the background of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, or more precisely, in Barkley&#x27;s words, &quot;why Bilbo was included in the dwarves&#x27; plans at Gandalf&#x27;s suggestion.&quot;

Frank P. Riga and colleagues, also in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, write that Peter Jackson used the &quot;Quest&quot; to enrich the story when transforming &quot;The Hobbit&quot; from novel to film for his 2013 film adaptation, &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot;. Among other things, the film opens with the meeting between Gandalf and Thorin at The Prancing Pony. Elements of Gandalf&#x27;s motivations and previous discussions with Thorin also find their way into the 2012 film &quot;An Unexpected Journey&quot; as dialogue, particularly in the meeting held in Bilbo&#x27;s house. In their view, the &quot;Quest&quot; &quot;closely and thoroughly connects the action of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; with the larger, cosmic concerns of its sequel, showing how the Dwarves&#x27; struggle to regain their homeland became crucial in frustrating Sauron&#x27;s plan to attack Lorien and Rivendell.&quot; They explain that the quest had to succeed, or the actions described in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; could not have occurred. Jackson used the connections, they state; for instance, making Saruman order Gandalf to stop the quest, and making Gandalf refuse, supported by Galadriel.

<text>Political history is the narrative and survey of political events, ideas, movements, organs of government, voters, parties and leaders. It is closely related to other fields of history, including diplomatic history, constitutional history, social history, people&#x27;s history, and public history. Political history studies the organization and operation of power in large societies.

From approximately the 1960s onwards, the rise of competing subdisciplines, particularly social history and cultural history, led to a decline in the prominence of &quot;traditional&quot; political history, which tended to focus on the activities of political elites. In the two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, and the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.

==Political world history ==
The political history of the world examines the history of politics and government on a global scale, including international relations.

==Aspects of political history==
The first &quot;scientific&quot; political history was written by Leopold von Ranke in Germany in the 19th century. His methodologies profoundly affected the way historians critically examine sources; see historiography for a more complete analysis of the methodology of various approaches to history. An important aspect of political history is the study of ideology as a force for historical change. One author asserts that &quot;political history as a whole cannot exist without the study of ideological differences and their implications.&quot; Studies of political history typically centre around a single nation and its political change and development. Some historians identify the growing trend towards narrow specialization in political history during recent decades: &quot;while a college professor in the 1940s sought to identify himself as a &quot;historian&quot;, by the 1950s &quot;American historian&quot; was the designation.&quot;

From the 1970s onwards, new movements challenged traditional approaches to political history. The development of social history shifted the emphasis away from the study of leaders and national decisions, and towards the role of ordinary people, especially outsiders and minorities. Younger scholars shifted to different issues, usually focused on race, class and gender, with little room for elites. After 1990 social history itself began to fade, replaced with postmodern and cultural approaches that rejected grand narrative.

===United States: The new political history===

Traditional political history focused on major leaders and had long played a dominant role beyond academic historians in the United States. These studies accounted for about 25% of the scholarly books and articles written by American historians before 1950, and about 33% into the 1960s, followed by diplomacy. The arrival in the 1960s and 1970s of a new interest in social history led to the emergence of the &quot;new political history&quot; which saw young scholars put much more emphasis on the voters&#x27; behavior and motivation, rather than just the politicians. It relied heavily on quantitative methods to integrate social themes, especially regarding ethnicity and religion. The new social science approach was a harbinger of the fading away of interest in Great Men. The eclipse of traditional political approaches during the 1970s was a major shock, though diplomatic history fell even further. It was upstaged by social history, with a race/class/gender model. The number of political articles submitted to the &quot;Journal of American History&quot; fell by half from 33% to 15%. Patterson argued that contemporary events, especially the Vietnam War and Watergate, alienated younger scholars away from the study of politicians and their deeds. Political history never disappeared, but it never recovered its dominance among scholars, despite its sustained high popularity among the reading public. Some political historians made fun of their own predicament, as when William Leuchtenburg wrote, &quot;the status of the political historians within the profession has sunk to somewhere between that of a faith healer and a chiropractor. Political historians were all right in a way, but you might not want to bring one home to meet the family.&quot; Others were more analytical, as when Hugh Davis Graham observed:
:The ranks of traditional political historians are depleted, their assumptions and methods discredited, along with the Great White Man whose careers they chronicled.

===Britain===
Readman (2009) discusses the historiography of British political history in the 20th century. He describes how British political scholarship mostly ignored 20th century history due to temporal proximity to the recent past, the unavailability of primary sources, and the potential for bias. The article explores how transitions in scholarship have allowed for greater interest in 20th century history among scholars, which include less reliance on archival sources, methodological changes in historiography, and the flourishing of new forms of history such as oral history.

===Germany===
In the course of the 1960s, however, some German historians (notably Hans-Ulrich Wehler and his cohort) began to rebel against this idea, instead suggesting a &quot;Primacy of Domestic Politics&quot; (&quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot;), in which the insecurities of (in this case German) domestic policy drove the creation of foreign policy. This led to a considerable body of work interpreting the domestic policies of various states and the ways this influenced their conduct of foreign policy.

===France===
The French &quot;Annales School&quot; had already put an emphasis on the role of geography and economics on history, and of the importance of broad, slow cycles rather than the constant apparent movement of the &quot;history of events&quot; of high politics. It downplayed politics and diplomacy. The most important work of the &quot;Annales&quot; school, Fernand Braudel&#x27;s &quot;The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II&quot;, contains a traditional Rankean diplomatic history of Philip II&#x27;s Mediterranean policy, but only as the third and shortest section of a work largely focusing on the broad cycles of history in the &quot;longue durée&quot; (&quot;long term&quot;). The &quot;Annales&quot; were broadly influential, leading to a turning away from political history towards an emphasis on broader trends of economic and environmental change.

===Social history===

In the 1960s and 1970s, an increasing emphasis on giving a voice to the voiceless and writing the history of the underclasses, whether by using the quantitative statistical methods of social history or the more postmodern assessments of cultural history, also undermined the centrality of politics to the historical discipline. Leff noted how social historians, &quot;disdained political
history as elitist, shallow, altogether passe, and irrelevant to the drama of everyday lives.&quot;

===History of political regimes and institutions===
*MaxRange data is a project that defines and shows in detail the political status and development of institutional regimes of all states in the world from 1789. MaxRange also describes the background, development, external sources and major causes behind all political changes.
MaxRange is a dataset defining level of democracy and institutional structure (regime-type) on a 100-graded scale where every value represents a unique regimetype. Values are sorted from 1-100 based on level of democracy and political accountability. MaxRange defines the value (regimetype) corresponding to all states and every month from 1789 to 2015 and updating. MaxRange is created and developed by Max Range, and is now associated with the university of Halmstad, Sweden

<text>Legal history or the history of law is the study of how law has evolved and why it has changed. Legal history is closely connected to the development of civilizations and operates in the wider context of social history. Certain jurists and historians of legal process have seen legal history as the recording of the evolution of laws and the technical explanation of how these laws have evolved with the view of better understanding the origins of various legal concepts; some consider legal history a branch of intellectual history. Twentieth-century historians viewed legal history in a more contextualised manner – more in line with the thinking of social historians. They have looked at legal institutions as complex systems of rules, players and symbols and have seen these elements interact with society to change, adapt, resist or promote certain aspects of civil society. Such legal historians have tended to analyze case histories from the parameters of social-science inquiry, using statistical methods, analysing class distinctions among litigants, petitioners and other players in various legal processes. By analyzing case outcomes, transaction costs, and numbers of settled cases, they have begun an analysis of legal institutions, practices, procedures and briefs that gives a more complex picture of law and society than the study of jurisprudence, case law and civil codes can achieve.

==Ancient world==

Ancient Egyptian law, dating as far back as 3000 BC, was based on the concept of Ma&#x27;at, and was characterised by tradition, rhetorical speech, social equality and impartiality. By the 22nd century BC, Ur-Nammu, an ancient Sumerian ruler, formulated the first extant law code, consisting of casuistic statements (&quot;if... then...&quot;). Around 1760 BC, King Hammurabi further developed Babylonian law, by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as stelae, for the entire public to see; this became known as the Codex Hammurabi. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British Assyriologists, and has since been fully transliterated and translated into various languages, including English, German and French. Ancient Greek has no single word for &quot;law&quot; as an abstract concept, retaining instead the distinction between divine law (&quot;thémis&quot;), human decree (&quot;nomos&quot;) and custom (&quot;díkē&quot;). Yet Ancient Greek law contained major constitutional innovations in the development of democracy.

==Southern Asia==


Ancient India and China represent distinct traditions of law, and had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice. The &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, dating from the 400 BC, and the &quot;Manusmriti&quot; from 100 BCE were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance. Manu&#x27;s central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism, and was cited across South East Asia. During the Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent, sharia was established by the Muslim sultanates and empires, most notably Mughal Empire&#x27;s Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, compiled by emperor Aurangzeb and various scholars of Islam. After British colonialism, Hindu tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the British Empire. Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and Hong Kong also adopted the common law.

==Eastern Asia==
The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences. Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the French, but mostly the German Civil Code. This partly reflected Germany&#x27;s status as a rising power in the late nineteenth century. Similarly, traditional Chinese law gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the Qing dynasty in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law. Today Taiwanese law retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s nationalists, who fled there, and Mao Zedong&#x27;s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People&#x27;s Republic of China was heavily influenced by soviet Socialist law, which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights. Today, however, because of rapid industrialisation China has been reforming, at least in terms of economic (if not social and political) rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a turn away from administrative domination. Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the World Trade Organization.

==Canon law==


The legal history of the Catholic Church is the history of Catholic canon law, the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West. Canon law originates much later than Roman law but predates the evolution of modern European civil law traditions. The cultural exchange between the secular (Roman/Barbarian) and ecclesiastical (canon) law produced the jus commune and greatly influenced both civil and common law.

The history of Latin canon law can be divided into four periods: the &quot;jus antiquum&quot;, the &quot;jus novum&quot;, the &quot;jus novissimum&quot; and the &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;. In relation to the Code, history can be divided into the &quot;jus vetus&quot; (all law before the Code) and the &quot;jus novum&quot; (the law of the Code, or &quot;jus codicis&quot;). Eastern canon law developed separately.

In the twentieth century, canon law was comprehensively codified. On 27 May 1917, Pope Benedict XV codified the 1917 Code of Canon Law.

John XXIII, together with his intention to call the Second Vatican Council, announced his intention to reform canon law, which culminated in the 1983 Code of Canon Law, promulgated by John Paul II on 25 January 1983. John Paul II also brought to a close the long process of codifying the Eastern Catholic canon law common to all 23 sui juris Eastern Catholic Churches on 18 October 1990 by promulgating the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.

==Islamic law==

One of the major legal systems developed during the Middle Ages was Islamic law and jurisprudence. A number of important legal institutions were developed by Islamic jurists during the classical period of Islamic law and jurisprudence. One such institution was the &quot;Hawala&quot;, an early informal value transfer system, which is mentioned in texts of Islamic jurisprudence as early as the 8th century. &quot;Hawala&quot; itself later influenced the development of the &quot;Aval&quot; in French civil law and the &quot;Avallo&quot; in Italian law.

==European laws==
===Roman Empire===
Roman law was heavily influenced by Greek teachings. It forms the bridge to the modern legal world, over the centuries between the rise and decline of the Roman Empire. Roman law, in the days of the Roman Republic and Empire, was heavily procedural and there was no professional legal class. Instead a lay person, &quot;iudex&quot;, was chosen to adjudicate. Precedents were not reported, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised. Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the state, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges&#x27; decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. During the 6th century AD in the Eastern Roman Empire, the Emperor Justinian codified and consolidated the laws that had existed in Rome so that what remained was one twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before. This became known as the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;. As one legal historian wrote, &quot;Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before.&quot;

===Middle Ages===


During the Byzantine Empire the Justinian Code was expanded and remained in force until the Empire fell, though it was never officially introduced to the West. Instead, following the fall of the Western Empire and in former Roman countries, the ruling classes relied on the Theodosian Code to govern natives and Germanic customary law for the Germanic incomers – a system known as folk-right – until the two laws blended together. Since the Roman court system had broken down, legal disputes were adjudicated according to Germanic custom by assemblies of learned lawspeakers in rigid ceremonies and in oral proceedings that relied heavily on testimony.

After much of the West was consolidated under Charlemagne, law became centralized so as to strengthen the royal court system, and consequently case law, and abolished folk-right. However, once Charlemagne&#x27;s kingdom definitively splintered, Europe became feudalistic, and law was generally not governed above the county, municipal or lordship level, thereby creating a highly decentralized legal culture that favored the development of customary law founded on localized case law. However, in the 11th century, crusaders, having pillaged the Byzantine Empire, returned with Byzantine legal texts including the Justinian Code, and scholars at the University of Bologna were the first to use them to interpret their own customary laws. Medieval European legal scholars began researching the Roman law and using its concepts and prepared the way for the partial resurrection of Roman law as the modern civil law in a large part of the world. There was, however, a great deal of resistance so that civil law rivaled customary law for much of the late Middle Ages.

After the Norman conquest of England, which introduced Norman legal concepts into medieval England, the English King&#x27;s powerful judges developed a body of precedent that became the common law. In particular, Henry II instituted legal reforms and developed a system of royal courts administered by a small number of judges who lived in Westminster and traveled throughout the kingdom. Henry II also instituted the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, which allowed for jury trials and reduced the number of trials by combat. Louis IX of France also undertook major legal reforms and, inspired by ecclesiastical court procedure, extended Canon-law evidence and inquisitorial-trial systems to the royal courts. In 1280 and 1295 measures were instituted by the Court of Arches and other authorities in London to improve the conduct of lawyers in the courts. Also, judges no longer moved on circuits becoming fixed to their jurisdictions, and jurors were nominated by parties to the legal dispute rather than by the sheriff. In addition, by the 10th century, the Law Merchant, first founded on Scandinavian trade customs, then solidified by the Hanseatic League, took shape so that merchants could trade using familiar standards, rather than the many splintered types of local law. A precursor to modern commercial law, the Law Merchant emphasised the freedom of contract and alienability of property.

===Modern European law===

The two main traditions of modern European law are the codified legal systems of most of continental Europe, and the English tradition based on case law.

As nationalism grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, &quot;lex mercatoria&quot; was incorporated into countries&#x27; local law under new civil codes. Of these, the French Napoleonic Code and the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch became the most influential. As opposed to English common law, which consists of massive tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging. European Union law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent set down by the European Court of Justice.

== African law ==
The African law system is based on common law and civilian law. Many legal systems in Africa were based on ethnic customs and traditions before colonization took over their original system. The people listened to their elders and relied on them as mediators during disputes. Several states didn&#x27;t keep written records, as their laws were often passed orally. In the Mali Empire, the Kouroukan Fouga, was proclaimed in 1222–1236 AD as the official constitution of the state. It defined regulations in both constitutional and civil matters. The provisions of the constitution are still transmitted to this day by griots under oath. During colonization, authorities in Africa developed an official legal system called the Native Courts. After colonialism, the major faiths that stayed were Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism.

==United States==
The United States legal system developed primarily out of the English common law system (with the exception of the state of Louisiana, which continued to follow the French civilian system after being admitted to statehood). Some concepts from Spanish law, such as the prior appropriation doctrine and community property, still persist in some US states, particularly those that were part of the Mexican Cession in 1848.

Under the doctrine of federalism, each state has its own separate court system, and the ability to legislate within areas not reserved to the federal government.

<text>Debrecen ( ; ; ; ) is Hungary&#x27;s second-largest city, after Budapest, the regional centre of the Northern Great Plain region and the seat of Hajdú-Bihar County. A city with county rights, it was the largest Hungarian city in the 18th century and it is one of the Hungarian people&#x27;s most important cultural centres. Debrecen was also the capital city of Hungary during the revolution in 1848–1849. During the revolution, the dethronement of the Habsburg dynasty was declared in the Reformed Great Church. The city also served as the capital of Hungary by the end of World War II in 1944–1945. It is home to the University of Debrecen.

==Etymology==
There are at least three narratives of the origin of the city&#x27;s name. The city is first documented in 1235, as &quot;Debrezun&quot;. One theory states that the name derives from the Turkic word , which means &#x27;live&#x27; or &#x27;move.&#x27; Another theory says the name is of Slavic origin and means &#x27;well-esteemed&#x27;, from Slavic Dьbricinъ or from &quot;dobre zliem&quot; (&quot;good land&quot;). Thirdly and lastly, Professor Šimon Ondruš derived the toponym from Proto-Slavic term (gorge). 

The standard Romanian name for the city is , however Romanian communities in Hungary use the version .

== History ==


The settlement was established after the Hungarian conquest. Debrecen became more important after some of the small villages of the area (Boldogasszonyfalva, Szentlászlófalva) were deserted due to the Mongol invasion of Europe. It experienced rapid development after the middle of the 13th century.

In 1361, Louis I of Hungary granted the citizens of Debrecen the right to choose the town&#x27;s judge and council. This provided some opportunities for self-government for the town. By the early 16th century, Debrecen was an important market town.

King Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, as part of a treaty with Serbian ruler Stefan Lazarević, gave him the opportunity to rule Debrecen in September 1411. A year after Lazarević&#x27;s death in 1426, his role was taken over by his successor, Đurađ Branković. Between 1450 and 1507, it was a domain of the Hunyadi family.

During the Ottoman period, being close to the border and having no castle or city walls, Debrecen often found itself in difficult situations and the town was saved only by the diplomatic skills of its leaders. Sometimes the town was protected by the Ottoman Empire, sometimes by the Catholic European rulers or by Francis II Rákóczi, prince of Transylvania. Debrecen later embraced the Protestant Reformation quite early, earning the monikers of &quot;the Calvinist Rome&quot; and &quot;the Geneva of Hungary&quot;. At this period the inhabitants of the town were mainly Hungarian Calvinists. Debrecen came under Ottoman control as a sanjak between 1558 and 1693 and orderly bounded to the eyalets of Budin (1541–1596), Eğri (1596–1660) and Varat (1660–1693) as &quot;Debreçin&quot;.

In 1693, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor elevated Debrecen to free royal town status. In 1715, the Roman Catholic Church returned to Debrecen, and the town gave it a place to build a church, allowing the Piarist monks to build the St. Ann&#x27;s Cathedral. By this time the town was an important cultural, commercial and agricultural centre, and many future scholars and poets attended its Protestant College (a predecessor of today&#x27;s University of Debrecen and also of Debrecen Reformed Theological University).

In 1849, Debrecen was the capital of Hungary for a short time when the Hungarian revolutionary government fled there from Pest-Buda (modern-day Budapest). In April 1849, the dethronization of Habsburgs (neglected after the fall of the revolution) and the independence of Hungary was proclaimed here by Lajos Kossuth at the Great (Calvinist) Church (&quot;Nagytemplom&quot; in Hungarian.) The last battle of the war of independence was also close to Debrecen. The Russians, allied to Habsburgs, defeated the Hungarian army close to the western part of the town.

After the war, Debrecen slowly began to prosper again. In 1857, the railway line between Budapest and Debrecen was completed, and Debrecen soon became a railway junction. New schools, hospitals, churches, factories, and mills were built, banks and insurance companies settled in the city. The appearance of the city began to change too: with new, taller buildings, parks and villas, it no longer resembled a provincial town and began to look like a modern city. In 1884, Debrecen became the first Hungarian city to have a steam tramway.

After World War I, Hungary lost a considerable portion of its eastern territory to Romania, and Debrecen once again became situated close to the border of the country. It was occupied by the Romanian army for a short time in 1919. Tourism provided a way for the city to begin to prosper again. Many buildings (among them an indoor swimming pool and Hungary&#x27;s first stadium) were built in the central park, the &quot;Nagyerdő&quot; (&quot;Big Forest&quot;), providing recreational facilities. The building of the university was completed. Hortobágy, a large pasture owned by the city, became a tourist attraction.

During World War II, Debrecen was almost completely destroyed, 70% of the buildings suffered damage, 50% of them were completely destroyed. A major battle involving combined arms, including several hundred tanks (Battle of Debrecen), occurred near the city in October 1944. Debrecen was captured by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front on 20 October. After 1944, the reconstruction began and Debrecen became the capital of Hungary for a short time once again. The citizens began to rebuild their city, trying to restore its pre-war status, but the new, Communist government of Hungary had other plans. The institutions and estates of the city were taken into public ownership, private property was taken away. This forced change of the old system brought new losses to Debrecen; half of its area was annexed to nearby towns, and the city also lost its rights over Hortobágy. In 1952, two new villages – Ebes and Nagyhegyes – were formed from former parts of Debrecen, while in 1981, the nearby village Józsa was annexed to the city.

== Demographics ==
=== Languages ===
According to the 2011 census, the total population of Debrecen were 211,320, of whom 209,782 people (99.3%) spoke Hungarian. 49,909 (23.6%) also knew English, 22,454 (10.6%) German, and 5,416 (2.6%) could speak Russian.

===Ethnic groups===
According to the 2011 census, there were 177,435 (84.0%) Hungarians, 1,305 (0.6%) Romani, 554 (0.3%) Germans and 504 (0.2%) Romanians in Debrecen. 31,931 people (15.1% of the total population) did not declare their ethnicity. Excluding these people Hungarians made up 98.9% of the total population. In Hungary people can declare more than one ethnicity, so the sum of ethnicities is higher than the total population.
===Religion===

According to the 2011 census, there were 52,459 (24.8%) Hungarian Reformed (Calvinist), 23,413 (11.1%) Latin Catholic, 10,762 (5.1%) Greek Catholic, 899 (0.4%) Baptist, 885 (0.4%) Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and 812 (0.4%) Lutheran in Debrecen. 54,909 people (26.0%) were irreligious, 3,877 (1.8%) atheist, while 59,955 people (28.4%) did not declare their religion.

====Reformed Church in Debrecen====

From the 16th century, the Reformation took roots in the city; first Lutheranism, then Calvin&#x27;s teachings become predominant. From 1551, the Calvinist government of the city forbade Catholics from moving to Debrecen. Catholic churches were taken over by the Calvinist church. The Catholic faith vanished from the city until 1715 when it regained a church. Several Calvinist church leaders like Peter Melius Juhasz who translated the Genevan Psalms lived and worked here. In 1567, a synod was formed in the city when the Second Helvetic Confession was adopted. Famous Calvinist colleges and schools were formed. Nickname of Debrecen commonly used in Hungary is the &quot;Calvinist Rome&quot; or the &quot;Geneva of Hungary&quot; because of the great percentage of the Calvinist faith in the city as well as the Calvinist church has significant influence in the city and the region. Debrecen is also home to the Reformed Theological University of Debrecen (Debreceni Református Hittudományi Egyetem), founded in 1538 and was the only Calvinist theological institute in the country permitted to function during the communist rule.

The Hungarian Reformed Church has about 20 congregations in Debrecen, including the famous Reformed Great Church of Debrecen, which can easily accommodate about 5000 people (with 3000 seats).

====Jewish community====
Jews were first allowed to settle in Debrecen in 1814, with an initial population count of 118 men within 4 years.
Twenty years later, they were allowed to purchase land and homes. By 1919, they consisted 10% of the population (with over 10,000 community members listed) and owned almost half of the large properties in and around the town.

The Hungarian antisemitic laws of 1938 caused many businesses to close, and in 1939 many Jews were enslaved and sent to Ukraine, where many died in minefields.

In 1940, the Germans estimated that 12,000 Jews were left in the town. In 1941, Jews of Galician and Polish origin were expelled, reducing the number of Jews to 9142. In 1942, more Jews were drafted into the Hungarian forced labor groups and sent to Ukraine.

German forces entered the city on 20 March 1944, (Two and a half weeks before Passover) ordering a Judenrat (Jewish Council) headed by Rabbi Pal (Meir) Weisz, and a Jewish police squad was formed, headed by former army captain Bela Lusztbaum. On 30 March 1944, (a week before Passover) the Jews were ordered to wear the Yellow star of David. Jewish cars were confiscated and phone lines cut. During the Passover week, many Jewish dignitaries were taken to a nearby prison camp, eventually reaching the number of 300 prisoners. A week later all Jewish stores were closed, and a public book-burning of Jewish books was presided over by the antisemitic newspaper editor Mihaly Kalosvari Borska. 

An order to erect a ghetto was issued on 28 April 1944, in the name of the town mayor Sandor Kolscey, who opposed the act, and was ousted by the Germans. Jews were forced to build the Ghetto walls, finishing it within less than a month on 15 May 1944.

On 7 June 1944, all movement in or out of the Ghetto was prohibited and a week later all Debrecen Jews were deported to the nearby Serly brickyards, and stripped of their belongings, joining Jews from other areas.

Ten families of prominent Jews, including those of Rabbi Weisz and orthodox chief Rabbi Strasser, along with the heads of the Zionist (non orthodox) movement joined the Kasztner train. (According to some sources, the Strasshoff camps were filled with Jews for negotiations in case the Germans could receive something for releasing these Jews, among them 6841 from Debrecen.) 298 of these Debrecen Jews were shot by the SS in Bavaria, after being told they would reach Theresienstadt. Some young Debrecen Jews escaped the town, led by the high school principal Adoniyahu Billitzer and reached Budapest, joining resistance movements and partisans.

Most of the remaining Debrecen Jews were deported to Auschwitz, reaching there on 3 July 1944.
Debrecen was occupied by the Soviet Army on 20 October 1944. Some 4,000 Jews of Debrecen and its surroundings survived the war, creating a community of 4,640 in 1946 – the largest in the region. About 400 of those moved to Israel, and many others moved to the west by 1970, with 1,200 Jews left in the town, using two synagogues, one of them established before World War I.

==Climate==
Debrecen, typically for its Central European location, has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot; bordering on &quot;Dfa&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcbo&quot; bordering on &quot;Dcao&quot;). The annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which July is the wettest with , while January is the driest with only .

== Culture ==

Mainly thanks to the Reformation and the prestigious Reformed College of Debrecen, founded in 1538, Debrecen has been the intellectual and cultural centre of the surrounding area since the 16th century. The College formed into a full-scale university in 1912, and its intellectual life developed a sphere of influence between Eger and Oradea (Hu: &quot;Nagyvárad&quot;, now in Romania). In 1949–1950, several departments of the university were shut down, due to Communist takeover, with many students and teachers being expelled. During the decades of the socialist regime, Debrecen had three separate universities: the Kossuth Lajos University of Sciences (KLTE) was the bearer of the College&#x27;s traditions with its arts and natural science faculties; the Medical University of Debrecen (DOTE) was the main medical school of Eastern Hungary; and the Debrecen University of Agriculture (DATE) was one of the two major agricultural universities of the country besides Gödöllő. The three entities formed the current University of Debrecen in 2000, with several new faculties being formed since the 1990s from the Faculty of Law to the newest addition of the Faculty of Informatics. Its main building, which now almost unanimously belongs to the Faculty of Arts, is still widely recognized work of architecture (mostly thanks to its main building). The university is the largest university in Hungary, has more than 100 departments and is a major research facility in Europe. The university is well known for the cactus research laboratory in the botanic gardens behind the main building.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Debrecen press attracted several notable figures to the city. Endre Ady, Gyula Krúdy, and Árpád Tóth all began their journalistic careers in Debrecen. Prominent literary figures from the city have included Magda Szabó, and . One of Hungary&#x27;s best known poets, Mihály Csokonai Vitéz, was born and lived in the city. The city&#x27;s theatre, built in 1865, was named in his honour in 1916, but can trace its roots back to the National Theatre Company founded in Debrecen in 1789, which at first gave performances in the carthouse of an inn. Celebrated actress Lujza Blaha is among those to have performed there.

<text>Twentieth Century is a 1934 American pre-Code screwball comedy film directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Barrymore, Carole Lombard, Walter Connolly, and Roscoe Karns. Much of the film is set on the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; train as it travels from Chicago to New York City. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur adapted their 1932 Broadway play of the same name—itself based on the unproduced play &quot;Napoleon of Broadway&quot; by Charles Bruce Millholland—with uncredited contributions from Gene Fowler and Preston Sturges.

Along with Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, also released in 1934 (which coincidentally has the same music over the opening titles), &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; is considered to be a prototype for the screwball comedy. &quot;Howard Hawks&#x27; rapid-fire romantic comedy established the essential ingredients of the &quot;screwball&quot; – a dizzy dame, a charming, but befuddled, hero, dazzling dialogue, and a dash of slapstick.&quot; Its success propelled Lombard into the front ranks of film comediennes. The film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2011.
==Plot==

Ebullient Broadway &quot;impresario&quot; Oscar Jaffe takes an unknown lingerie model named Mildred Plotka and makes her the star of his latest play, despite the grave misgivings of everyone else, including his two long-suffering assistants, accountant Oliver Webb and the consistently tipsy Owen O&#x27;Malley. Through intensive training, Oscar transforms his protégée into the actress &quot;Lily Garland&quot;, and both she and the play are resounding successes. On opening night, after her triumph, he comes to her dressing room to apologize abjectly for his behavior to her. As planned, she falls into his arms, begging him never to leave her, and they become lovers.

Three years later, their partnership has spawned three more smash hits, and Lily has been recognized as a transcendent talent. As a couple, they are famous—or infamous—for their spectacular battles.

Lily tries to break off their professional and personal relationship, fed up with Oscar&#x27;s jealousy and control of every aspect of her life. Oscar talks her out of it, promising to be more trusting and less controlling in the future. Instead, he secretly hires a private detective agency run by McGonigle to watch her every move, even to the point of tapping her telephone. When she finds out, it is the last straw; she leaves for Hollywood and soon becomes a successful film star.

Without Lily, Oscar produces flop after flop. After one such disappointment, to avoid being imprisoned for his debts, he is forced to disguise himself to board the luxurious &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; express train traveling from Chicago to New York City&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal. By chance, Lily boards the train at a later stop with her boyfriend George Smith. After prevaricating, Oscar sees a chance to restore his fortunes and salvage his relationship with Lily.

Oscar gets George to break up with Lily by revealing that he was once her lover. Knowing that Lily offers him one last chance at professional success, Oscar schemes to get her to sign a contract with him. He tells her of his wish for her to play Mary Magdalene in his new Passion Play, describing the role to her: &quot;Sensual, heartless, but beautiful. Running the gamut from the gutter, to glory. Can you see her, Lily? This little wanton ending up in tears at the foot of the cross. I&#x27;m going to have Judas strangle himself with her hair.&quot; However, Lily wants nothing more to do with him, as she is on her way to sign with Oscar&#x27;s rival (and former employee), Max Jacobs. Meanwhile, Oliver thinks he has found a financial backer for Oscar&#x27;s project, fellow passenger Mathew J. Clark, not realizing that Clark is a harmless escapee from a mental asylum. When Oscar is slightly wounded in a scuffle with Clark, he pretends to be dying and gets a distraught Lily to sign his contract. At their first rehearsal, Oscar reverts to his usual self, domineering a desperate Lily.

==Production==
The genesis of &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; was &quot;Napoleon of Broadway&quot;, a play by Charles Bruce Millholland about his experiences in working for Broadway producer David Belasco. His play was not produced, but it became the basis for the Hecht–MacArthur comedy, which lasted for 152 performances on Broadway, beginning on December 29, 1932, and which they later adapted for the big screen. Howard Hawks was not the first choice; Roy Del Ruth and Lewis Milestone had been set to direct before Hawks got the job. Columbia tried to get William Frawley from the Broadway cast, but instead borrowed Roscoe Karns from Paramount Pictures.

Before Lombard was cast, Columbia boss Harry Cohn negotiated with Eugenie Leontovich, who had played the part on Broadway, and then considered Gloria Swanson and Miriam Hopkins. Other reports say that Ina Claire, Tallulah Bankhead, Ruth Chatterton, Constance Bennett, Ann Harding, Kay Francis, and Joan Crawford were also considered for the lead role by Cohn and Hawks. However, Hawks believed that Lombard was a brilliant actress who had yet to be unleashed on film. He convinced a reluctant Columbia to borrow her from Paramount.

During Barrymore&#x27;s initial reading with her, he looked to Hawks with an expression that showed he did not share Hawks&#x27;s intuition. The rest of the production went dryly, with Lombard staggering through one scene after another and playing the same stoic characters that she had been taught to portray. Hawks took her aside and asked her what she was being paid for the film. Lombard told him and Hawks asked her what she would do if a man said &quot;something&quot; about her, coming up with an example from the back of his mind. Lombard said, &quot;I would kick him in the balls.&quot; Hawks said, &quot;Well, Barrymore said that, so why don&#x27;t you kick him?&quot; Of course Barrymore had said nothing of the sort, but the plan worked and after Lombard yelped a few profanities, she continued through the shoot with an unforgettable vigor. For the remainder of her career—until her tragic death in an airplane crash in 1942 at age 33—before beginning a film, Lombard would always send a telegram to Hawks saying, &quot;I&#x27;m going to kick him!&quot;

Lombard and Barrymore became friends during filming. When Barrymore&#x27;s career was declining, Lombard raised hell to get him to work on her film &quot;True Confession&quot; (1937).

Preston Sturges was hired to write the screenplay around late November 1933, but was removed from the project a week later because he had not made sufficient progress. Columbia then tried to get Herman Mankiewicz to write it, with Felix Young to produce.

&quot;Twentieth Century&quot;—a title which Columbia considered changing because they feared that many westerners would not be familiar with the name of the train—was in production from February 22 to March 24, 1934.

During the filming, there were some problems with the censors at the Hays Office, who were concerned about the religious angle in the comedy of the film, and requested that it be toned down. Joseph Breen, who ran the Office, worried that &quot;there will be serious difficulty in inducing an anti-Semitic public to accept a [motion picture] play produced by an industry believed to be Jewish in which the Passion Play is used for comedy purposes.&quot; The Office ultimately asked that one line be removed, which it was. They also requested that it be made less clear where Oscar jabs Lily with a pin.

&quot;Twentieth Century&quot; was premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on May 3, 1934, and went into general release on May 11.

==Reception==
In his &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;, Mordaunt Hall wrote, &quot;John Barrymore is in fine fettle in Twentieth Century&quot; and &quot;acts with such imagination and zest that he never fails to keep the picture thoroughly alive.&quot; All of the principal actors—Lombard (&quot;gives an able portrayal&quot;), Connolly (&quot;excellent&quot;), and Karns (&quot;adds bright flashes&quot;), as well as Girardot (&quot;an asset&quot;)—were also praised. However, Hall was less enthused about the comedy style, stating, &quot;it seems a pity that they [Hecht and MacArthur] were tempted to stray occasionally too far from the realm of restrained comedy and indulge their fancy for boisterous humor.&quot; The movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall.

&quot;Twentieth Century&quot;″s box office performance was described as &quot;dismal&quot;. It was a box office disappointment.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine said, &quot;&quot;Twentieth Century&quot; is good fun, slick, wild and improbable.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.

In December 2011, &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In its induction, the Registry said that the &quot;sophisticated farce about the tempestuous romance of an egocentic impresario and the star he creates did not fare well on its release, but has come to be recognized as one of the era&#x27;s finest film comedies, one that gave John Barrymore his last great film role and Carole Lombard her first.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===&quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot;===
In 1978, Cy Coleman (music), Betty Comden and Adolph Green (book and lyrics) created the stage musical &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot;, based on the film, the original Hecht and MacArthur play and the unpublished play by Millholland. It ran on Broadway for 460 performances, and was revived for a special benefit performance on September 26, 2005. Its first full-scale Broadway revival officially began in March 2015, with Peter Gallagher and Kristin Chenoweth in the lead roles.

===Radio===
&quot;Twentieth Century&quot; was presented on &quot;Star Playhouse&quot; on November 22, 1953. The adaptation starred Lilli Palmer and Rex Harrison, who were married in real life.

<text>Raúl Modesto Castro Ruz ( ; ; born 3 June 1931) is a Cuban retired politician and general who served as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most senior position in the one-party communist state, from 2011 to 2021, and President of Cuba between 2008 and 2018, succeeding his brother Fidel Castro.

One of the military leaders of the Cuban Revolution, Castro served as the minister of the Armed Forces from 1959 to 2008. His ministerial tenure made him the longest-serving minister of the armed forces. Castro was also a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, the highest decision-making body, from 1965 until 2021.

Because of his brother&#x27;s illness, Castro became the acting president of the Council of State in a temporary transfer of power from 31 July 2006. Castro was officially made president by the National Assembly on 24 February 2008, after his brother, who was still ailing, announced on 19 February 2008 that he would not stand again. He was re-elected president on 24 February 2013. Shortly thereafter, Castro announced that his second term would be his final term, and that he would not seek re-election in 2018. He stepped down from the presidency on 19 April 2018 after his successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel was elected by the National Assembly following parliamentary elections. Castro remained the first secretary of the Communist Party; he was still considered the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the country, retaining oversight over the president. Castro announced at the Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, which began on 16 April 2021, that he was retiring. His successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel, was voted in on 19 April.

Castro was also the head of the constitutional reform commission, and continues to have a seat representing Santiago de Cuba&#x27;s Segundo Frente municipality in the National Assembly.

== Early life ==
Raúl Modesto Castro Ruz was born in Birán, Cuba, the legal son of a Spanish immigrant father, Ángel Castro who was 55 at the time of his birth, and a Cuban-born mother of Canarian parentage, Lina Ruz. Raúl is the youngest of three brothers: Ramón, Fidel, and himself. He also has four sisters: Angela, Juanita, Emma, and Agustina. Ángel Castro&#x27;s first wife, Maria Argota, also raised five legal half-siblings of Raúl: Pedro Emilio, Maria Lidia, Manuel, Antonia, and Georgina.

As children, the Castro brothers were expelled from the first school they attended (Colegio La Salle) in Santiago de Cuba. Like Fidel, Raúl later attended the Jesuit School of Colegio Dolores in Santiago de Cuba and Belen Jesuit Preparatory School in Havana. Raúl as an undergraduate studied Public Administration at the University of Havana since 1950, but he did not graduate. Whereas Fidel was an excellent student, Raúl turned in mostly mediocre performances. Raúl became a committed socialist and joined the Socialist Youth, an affiliate of the Soviet-oriented Popular Socialist Party, the island&#x27;s Communist party. The brothers participated actively in sometimes violent student actions.

In 1953, Raúl served as a member of the 26th of July Movement group that attacked the Moncada Barracks; he received a 13-year prison sentence and spent 22 months in prison as a result of this action. During his subsequent exile in Mexico, he participated in the preparations for the expedition of the boat &quot;Granma&quot; to Cuba.

== Commander in the Cuban Revolution ==
When the &quot;Granma&quot; landing failed and the 82 expeditionaries were detected by government troops soon after, Raúl was one of only 12 fighters who managed to reach a safe haven in the Sierra Maestra mountains, forming the core of the nascent rebel army . As Fidel&#x27;s brother and trusted right-hand man and given his proven leadership abilities during and after the Moncada attack, he was given progressively bigger commands. On 27 February 1958 Raúl was made &quot;comandante&quot; and assigned the mission to cross the old province of Oriente leading a column of guerrillas to open, to the northeast of that territory, the &quot;Frank País Eastern Front&quot;.

As a result of Raúl&#x27;s &quot;Eastern Front&quot; operations, he was not involved in the pivotal Operation Verano (which came close to destroying the main body of fighters but ended up a spectacular victory for Fidel), but Raúl&#x27;s forces remained active and grew over time.

On 26 June 1958, Raúl Castro&#x27;s rebels kidnapped ten Americans and two Canadians from the property of Moa Bay Mining Company (an American company) on the north coast of Oriente Province. The next day rebels took hostage 24 U.S. servicemen on leave from the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay. This incident brought total kidnapped hostages to 36 (34 U.S. and 2 Canadian citizens).

U.S. Ambassador Earl E. T. Smith and his staff determined the kidnappings had the following objectives: Obtain worldwide publicity, regain M-26-7 prestige lost by general strike call failure, force Batista&#x27;s Air Force to stop bombing rebel holds, and gain public recognition from the U.S. Two tactical objectives the kidnapping achieved for Castro forces can be discerned from contemporaneous reporting in Time: Batista declaring a ceasefire for negotiations, forcing a reduction in Operation Verano air raids; the rebels used the lulls to regroup and fly in arms.

The hostage-taking caused significant U.S. backlash, including unfavorable public reaction, and U.S. consideration to re-establishing military support to Batista and deploying U.S. forces to free the hostages. Ultimately, the hostages were released in very small groups, extracting the maximum press attention. After their release, the hostages said they were treated well with some even claiming to support the rebel cause.

Regarding the captured Batista government soldiers, Raúl Castro notes in his war diaries: &quot;All three were brought food and told that they would be released and only their weapons would be kept. They had money and watches we needed, but according to our principles, we didn&#x27;t touch them.&quot; In the territories under guerrilla control, it created an autonomous structure by establishing hospitals, schools and several material manufacturing plants. In 1958, he was also at the origin of the M-26 intelligence services.

By October 1958, after reinforcement by Fidel, the brothers had about 2,000 fighters and were operating freely throughout Oriente province. In December, while Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos were operating in Santa Clara, Fidel and Raúl&#x27;s army laid siege to Maffo, capturing it on 30 December. Their victorious army then headed to Santiago de Cuba, capital of Oriente province.

In response to the victory by Che Guevara at the Battle of Santa Clara, the U.S.-backed President Fulgencio Batista fled Cuba in the early morning of 1 January 1959. The two Castro brothers with their army arrived on the outskirts of Santiago de Cuba and said their forces would storm the city at 6 P.M. on 1 January if it did not first surrender. The commander (Colonel Rego Rubido) surrendered Santiago de Cuba without a fight. The war was over, and Fidel was able to take power in Havana when he arrived on 8 January 1959.

Raúl&#x27;s abilities as a military leader during the revolution are hard to see clearly. Unlike Che Guevara or Cienfuegos, Raúl had no significant victories he could claim credit for on his own. After Batista&#x27;s fall, Raúl had the task of overseeing trials and execution of between 30 and 70 soldiers loyal to deposed President Batista who had been convicted of war crimes.

== Political career ==
=== Early political career ===

Raúl Castro Ruz was a member of the national leadership of the Integrated Revolutionary PO Organizations (established July 1961; dissolved March 1962) and of the United Party of the Socialist Revolution of Cuba (established March 1962; dissolved October 1965). He is also credited with helping shoot down a Lockheed U2 and killing Major Rudolf Anderson.

He served as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and Second Secretary of its Politburo from the Party&#x27;s formation in October 1965; also, as First Vice President of the Cuban Council of State of the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power and Council of Ministers when these were established in 1976.

=== Assumption of presidential duties ===
On 31 July 2006, Fidel Castro&#x27;s personal secretary, Carlos Valenciaga, announced on state-run television that Fidel Castro would provisionally hand over the duties of First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (party chief), President of the Council of State of Cuba (head of state), President of the Council of Ministers of Cuba (prime minister), and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to Raúl Castro while Fidel underwent and recovered from intestinal surgery to repair gastrointestinal bleeding.

Many commentators regarded Raúl Castro as a political hardliner who would maintain the Communist Party of Cuba&#x27;s influence in the country. However, others believed that he was more pragmatic than his older brother and willing to institute some market-oriented economic policies. It was speculated that he favored a variant of the current Chinese and Vietnamese political and economic model for Cuba in the hopes of preserving some elements of the socialist system.

Raúl is considered by some to be less charismatic than his brother Fidel Castro, who remained largely out of public view during the transfer-of-duty period. His few public appearances included hosting a gathering of leaders of the Non-Aligned nations in September 2006, and leading the national commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the landing of the boat &quot;Granma&quot;, which also became Fidel&#x27;s belated 80th-birthday celebrations.

In a speech to university students, Raúl stated that a communist system in Cuba would remain, and that &quot;Fidel is irreplaceable, unless we all replace him together.&quot;

On 1 May 2007 Raúl presided over the May Day celebrations in Havana. According to &quot;Granma&quot; the crowd reached over one million participants, with delegations from over 225 organizations and 52 countries.

Raúl has a reputation for his businesslike, unanimated delivery of speeches.

=== Communist leader ===

After assuming what was originally announced as a temporary control over the presidency in 2006, on 24 February 2008 Raúl Castro won election as the new President of the Council of State and President of the Council of Ministers during a legislative session held at Cuba&#x27;s Palace of Conventions in Havana. His administration subsequently announced several economic reforms. In March 2008 the government removed restrictions on the purchase of numerous products not available under Fidel Castro&#x27;s administration – including DVD-players, computers, rice cookers, and microwaves. In an effort to boost food production, the government allowed private farmers and cooperatives to lease idle state-owned land and moved much of the decision-making process regarding land use from the national level to the municipal level.

All death sentences (about 30) were commuted between 2008 and 2010, although none had been executed since 2003.

In mid-2008, the government overhauled the salary structure of all state-run companies so that harder-working employees could earn higher wages. In addition, the government removed restrictions against the use of cell phones and investigated the removal of travel restrictions on Cubans.

In March 2009, Raúl Castro dismissed some officials.

In April 2011, Raúl announced a plan of 300 economic reforms encouraging private initiative, reducing state spending, encouraging foreign investment and agrarian reforms. He also announced a limitation on presidential terms, including his own.

On 24 February 2013, Cuba&#x27;s parliament named Raúl Castro to a new five-year term as president and appointed Miguel Díaz-Canel as his first vice president. Castro announced that day that he would step down from power after his second term as president ended in 2018.

In 2018, he was selected as a candidate for the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power by the Segundo Frente municipality in Santiago de Cuba, regarded as the cradle of the Cuban Revolution.

Miguel Díaz-Canel took over as President of Cuba (President of the Council of State) on 19 April 2018. However, Raúl Castro remained First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and hence the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Cuba, until he resigned on 19 April 2021.

=== Normalization of relations with the United States ===
Raúl Castro said in a 2008 interview: &quot;The American people are among our closest neighbors. We should respect each other. We have never held anything against the American people. Good relations would be mutually advantageous. Perhaps we cannot solve all of our problems, but we can solve a good many of them.&quot;

On 10 December 2013, Castro, in a significant move, shook hands with and greeted American President Barack Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.

On 17 December 2014, Castro and Obama made separate announcements to the effect that efforts to normalize relations between the two nations would begin with the re-establishment of embassies in Havana and Washington. Direct diplomatic relations had previously ceased in 1961 after Cuba became closely allied with the USSR.

Argentine-born Pope Francis facilitated the rapprochement between the U.S. and Cuba, allowing the Vatican to be used for secret negotiations. Castro and Obama made simultaneous public announcements about the progress toward normalization.

On 20 July 2015 Cuba and the United States officially resumed full diplomatic relations with the sections of &quot;Cuban interests&quot; in Washington, D.C., and &quot;U.S. interests&quot; in Havana upgraded to embassies.

On 20 March 2016 Obama made a visit to Cuba to meet with Castro – the first visit of a sitting U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years.

Speaking in 2017, Castro criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s proposition of the Mexican wall and restrictive trade policy. Castro called Trump&#x27;s plans egotistical and – for the border – irrational. &quot;You can&#x27;t contain poverty, catastrophes, and migrants with walls, but with cooperation, understanding, and peace,&quot; Castro said. In November 2016 Trump (as U.S. President-elect) targeted Raúl in a tweet, saying, &quot;If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal&quot;.

Castro surprised a top American envoy in September 2017 while discussing alleged sonic attacks on American diplomatic staff. He denied involvement but allowed FBI rare access to investigate the incident that allegedly left 21 people with hearing loss and brain damage.

In September 2019 the United States sanctioned Castro and barred him from entering the U.S. due to Cuba&#x27;s support of the Nicolás Maduro government in Venezuela during the presidential crisis and alleged human-rights abuses caused by the government.

===Retirement===
On 16 April 2021, the 8th Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba assembled for a four-day meeting, marking the start of Castro&#x27;s final transfer of leadership and retirement from politics. Miguel Díaz-Canel was elected Castro&#x27;s successor as First Secretary of the Communist Party on 19 April 2021.

Castro makes occasional public appearances and speeches, most recently at the celebration of the 65th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 2024. Though officially retired, Raul Castro still retains a seat in the National Assembly and the title of Army General. He is also considered to wield great influence on affairs of state from behind the scenes.

== Public and personal life ==
Castro married Vilma Espín, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology chemical engineering student and the daughter of a wealthy lawyer for the Bacardi rum company, on 26 January 1959. Vilma became president of the Cuban Federation of Women. They have three daughters (Déborah, Mariela, and Nilsa) and one son (Alejandro) Castro Espín. Vilma Espín died on 18 June 2007.

Alejandro is a Colonel in the Ministry of the Interior, as director of the office of Intelligence Coordination between MININT and MINFAR, with full oversight and access to all of the activities of the Intelligence services. Most foreign analysts consider him to be the &quot;czar&quot; of Cuban Intelligence and Raul&#x27;s link to maintaining control over MININT, balancing it with his own control of MINFAR. He is widely viewed as Raul&#x27;s most trusted advisor and is likely being prepared for a future leadership role. Their daughter Mariela Castro currently heads the Cuban National Center for Sex Education, while Déborah is married to Colonel Luis Alberto Rodríguez, head of GAESA, the Armed Forces&#x27; economic division. He is widely regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Cuban Economy due to the Military&#x27;s hold on most of the lucrative business sectors. Deborah&#x27;s son, Raul Guillermo, nicknamed El Cangrejo (The Crab) due to a malformed finger, is Raul&#x27;s current chief bodyguard.

In an interview in 2006, following his assumption of presidential duties, Raúl Castro commented on his public profile stating: &quot;I am not used to making frequent appearances in public, except at times when it is required ... I have always been discreet, that is my way, and in passing I will clarify that I am thinking of continuing in that way.&quot;

In an interview with actor Sean Penn, Castro was described as &quot;warm, open, energetic, and sharp of wit&quot;. However, Juan Reynaldo Sanchez, a defected bodyguard for Fidel who knew Raul well, wrote later that his warm public exterior was a carefully maintained façade; In private, he found him to be &quot;rough, curt, almost unpleasant&quot; with a dubious sense of humor. Nevertheless, though, Sanchez considered Raul the true &quot;architect&quot; of the Castroist system, despite having a polar opposite personality to Fidel. Whereas Fidel was &quot;charismatic, energetic, visionary but extremely impulsive and totally disorganized&quot;, Raul was described as a &quot;natural, methodical, and uncompromising organizer&quot;.

After a meeting with Pope Francis in Vatican City on 10 May 2015, Castro said that he would conditionally consider returning to the Roman Catholic Church. He said in a televised news conference, &quot;I read all the speeches of the pope, his commentaries, and if the pope continues this way, I will go back to praying and go back to the [Roman Catholic] church. I am not joking.&quot; The pope visited Cuba before his September 2015 visit to the United States. Castro said: &quot;I promise to go to all his Masses&quot; when Pope Francis visited Cuba in 2015. Castro considered Christ a communist stating, &quot;I think that&#x27;s why they killed Jesus, for being a communist, for doing what Fidel defined as revolution... changing the situation.&quot;

== In popular culture ==

In the 1969 American film &quot;Che!&quot;, Castro was played by Paul Bertoya. In the 2002 film &quot;Fidel&quot;, he was played by Maurice Comte. In the 2008 American biographical film &quot;Che&quot;, he was played by Rodrigo Santoro.
He is mentioned as &quot;Fidel Castro&#x27;s brother&quot; in the Billy Bragg song, &quot;Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards&quot;.

<doc id="221750" wikidata="Q16836659" url="?curid=221750" title="Feudal land tenure in England">
<text>Under the English feudal system several different forms of land tenure existed, each effectively a contract with differing rights and duties attached thereto. Such tenures could be either free-hold if they were hereditable or perpetual or non-free if they terminated on the tenant&#x27;s death or at an earlier specified period.

==High medieval period==
In England&#x27;s ancient past large parts of the realm were unoccupied and owned as allodial titles: the landowners simply cooperated with the king out of a mutual interest instead of legal obligation. It was not until the Norman conquest, when William the Conqueror declared himself to be the sole allodial owner of the entire realm, that land tenures changed drastically. In William&#x27;s kingdom the common exchange and sale of land became restricted and all landholders were made to provide a service to their lord (&quot;no land without a lord&quot;).

===Norman reforms===
William stripped the land from those who opposed him and redistributed it among his followers. He introduced a new type of feudalism, in which obligation extended right down through the hierarchy, a model informed by the military system.

===Barony and knight-service===
The tenants-in-chief held their land by the tenure of barony, which required the tenant to provide a number of knights for their liege for 40 days per annum. After the served days, the liege was obliged either to begin paying the knights, or to dismiss them. However, tenants who held their land by the tenure of knight-service were not permitted to pass their lands to the heir automatically, but were required to obtain the lord&#x27;s approval.

The system failed because the assessment of knight&#x27;s fees became impossible to maintain. A few estates retained the same wealth and population as when first enfeoffed, with the result that the lord provided only a small number of the knights whom he was actually able to muster. Another issue was the practice of subinfeudation, by which the subtenants were able to alienate the land to tenants of their own. This became unpopular among the superior lords, and was banned by Edward I in his edict &quot;Quia Emptores&quot;. In compensation, the sale of properties was made legal.

==Late medieval period==
During the course of the late medieval period, knight-service came to be replaced by the tenure of scutage, under which tenants paid tax assessed according to their knight&#x27;s fee, instead of providing knights. Before the mid-13th century the fiefdoms had not been heritable owing to the uncertainty of whether the heir of the tenant would be capable of providing the required knight-service. As scutage replaced knight-service, that question fell outside consideration. Heirs were therefore able to succeed fiefs in exchange for the payment of a type of inheritance tax.

The Tenures Abolition Act 1660 declared that all land was to be held by socage tenure, ending the feudal tenure.

<doc id="221757" wikidata="Q375727" url="?curid=221757" title="Kangaroo court">
<text>Kangaroo court is an informal pejorative term for a court that ignores recognized standards of law or justice, carries little or no official standing in the territory within which it resides, and is typically convened ad hoc. A kangaroo court may ignore due process and come to a predetermined conclusion. The term is also used for a court held by a legitimate judicial authority, but which intentionally disregards the court&#x27;s legal or ethical obligations (compare show trial).

A kangaroo court could also develop when the structure and operation of the forum result in an inferior brand of adjudication. A common example of this is when institutional disputants (&quot;repeat players&quot;) have excessive and unfair structural advantages over individual disputants (&quot;one-shot players&quot;).

==Etymology==

The term is known to have been used in the United States in 1841: an article in &quot;The Daily Picayune&quot;, New Orleans quotes the &quot;Concordia Intelligencer&quot; reporting several lynchings &quot;upon various charges instituted by the Kangaroo court&quot;, asking &quot;Don&#x27;t comprehend: What is a Kangaroo court?&quot; The term is not attested to have been used in Australia, native land of the kangaroo, or elsewhere before then.

The term kangaroo court may have originated in Britain. In the late 1700s, British courts began sentencing people convicted of various crimes to penal transportation to Australia. In the 1800s, this was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Kangaroo Jump&quot;. It&#x27;s possible that those sentenced to transportation may have protested that they had been convicted and sentenced by a kangaroo court. Some sources suggest that the term may have been popularized during the California Gold Rush of 1849 to which many thousands of Australians flocked. In consequence of the Australian miners&#x27; presence, it may have come about as a description of the hastily carried-out proceedings used to deal with the issue of claim-jumping miners.
The derivation of the term is not known, although there has been speculation. It could be from the notion of justice proceeding &quot;by leaps&quot;, like a kangaroo – in other words, &quot;jumping over&quot; (intentionally ignoring) evidence that would be in favour of the defendant. An alternative suggestion is that, as these courts are often convened quickly to deal with an immediate issue, they are called kangaroo courts since they have &quot;jumped up&quot; out of nowhere, like a kangaroo. Another possibility is that the phrase could refer to the pouch of a kangaroo, meaning the court is in someone&#x27;s pocket.

Etymologist Philologos suggests that the term arose &quot;because a place named &quot;Kangaroo&quot; sounded comical to its hearers, just as place names like &quot;Kalamazoo&quot;, and &quot;Booger Hole &quot;, and &quot;Okeefenokee Swamp&quot;, strike us as comical.&quot;

In 19th century America, an alternative term was “mustang” court, after horses that roamed the plains, thus evoking the image of a court presided over by a wild beast.

The term is still in common use in the Anglosphere.

==As informal proceedings in sport==

The term is sometimes used without any negative connotation. For example, many Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball teams have a kangaroo court to punish players for errors on the field, being late for a game or practice, not wearing proper attire to road games, or having a messy locker in the clubhouse. Fines are allotted, and at the end of the year, the money collected is given to charity or used for a team party at the end of the season.

A notable example includes in 2008, Mariano Rivera, then closer for the New York Yankees, was fined by his teammates after Rivera assisted division rival Roy Halladay in developing Halladay&#x27;s cut fastball, Rivera&#x27;s signature pitch.

==Historical examples==
Some examples of quasi-judicial proceedings that could be described as kangaroo courts are:

* Moscow trials, a series of show trials held by the Soviet Union in 1936–1938 against prominent long-time leaders of Soviet Bolsheviks such as Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, Karl Radek, Georgy Pyatakov, etc. Verdicts of Moscow trials were pre-defined by Joseph Stalin and specified by decrees of Politburo CPSU.
* NKVD troikas&#x27; trials.
* The &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot; (People&#x27;s Court) of Nazi Germany that convicted people who were suspected of being involved with the failed plot to assassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944.
* In 1835, a so-called &quot;vigilance committee&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, ran a legally meaningless show trial, by which they convicted abolitionist minister Amos Dresser of distribution of abolitionist publications; he repeatedly claimed innocence. He was publicly whipped 20 lashes, after which he left Tennessee as soon as he could do so safely.
* In August 1979, the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Tribunal, in Cambodia, tried Pol Pot and his brother Ieng San. After a lengthy trial with a duration of five days, both were sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; on 19 August 1979. Conclusive evidence showed that the verdicts and the sentencing papers had been prepared in advance of the trial. Relying on this evidence, the United Nations proceeded to de-legitimize the tribunal, stating that it did not comply with standards of international law.
* During the Romanian Revolution in 1989, President and Communist Party General Secretary Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena Ceaușescu were sentenced to death by a kangaroo court consisting of members of the military: two military judges, two colonels, and three other officers of lesser ranks. The prosecutor was Dan Voinea; two lawyers represented the defendant. All the members of the court were part of the Romanian People&#x27;s Army, which had recently switched to the side of the revolutionaries.
* In July 1987, five individuals (most prominently Anatoly Dyatlov, Viktor Bryukhanov, and Nikolai Fomin) implicated in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster were put on trial in what was widely recognized as a show trial with pre-determined verdicts. Despite strong evidence that serious design flaws in the Soviet RBMK nuclear reactor were largely to blame for the accident, all defendants were sentenced to hard labor in Soviet labor camps.

<text>Ludza (; , , , , &quot;Ludza&quot;) is a town in the Latgale region of eastern Latvia. Ludza is the oldest town in Latvia and this is commemorated by a key in its coat of arms. Ludza is the administrative centre of Ludza Municipality that is located nearby the Russian border. The population as of 2020 was 7,667.

==History==

After Nikolay Karamzin, Ludza was first mentioned as &quot;Лючин&quot; in Hypatian Codex dating back to 1173 or 1177. In 1399 the Livonian Order built a stone fortress atop an older Latgalian fortress and used Ludza as an eastern outpost in Livonia. Ludza Castle ruins can be visited nowadays.

===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===
After the dissolution of the Livonian Order in 1561, Ludza was incorporated into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and became a part of Wenden Voivodeship. In January 1626, during the Polish-Swedish War, Ludza was captured without a battle by Sweden due to the defeat of the forces of Polish-Lithuanian marshal Jan Stanisław Sapieha. Later it was recaptured by Polish forces.

In 1678, Commonwealth&#x27;s Sejm appointed a special commission in Grodno that had to build Catholic churches in Latgale. A year later, the commission visited Ludza and in 1687, building of the church was completed. In 1736, the church was destroyed by fire.

===Russian Empire===
After the first partition of Poland in 1772, Ludza was taken over by the Russian Empire and added to Vitebsk Governorate. Ludza received town rights in 1777 from Catherine II of Russia. During the first part of the 19th century, most of the population of Ludza were Jews (67% in 1815) and there were 7 synagogues in the town.

===Latvia===
After signing of the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty in 1920, Ludzas apriņķis and Ludza as its administrative centre was incorporated into the Republic of Latvia.

During World War II, Ludza was under German occupation from 4 July 1941 until 23 July 1944. It was administered as a part of the Generalbezirk Lettland of Reichskommissariat Ostland. The Jewish population was restricted to a ghetto. From July 1941 until the spring of 1942, hundreds of Jews were murdered in mass executions perpetrated by Einsatzgruppen.

After Latvia regained its independence in 1991, Ludza became the administrative centre of Ludza District. On July 1, 2009, due to the introduction of the new administrative division in Latvia it became the centre of Ludza Municipality.

Ludza Museum and Ludza Tourism Information Centre offer excursions around the town. The most visited sights are:

* Ludza History Museum and open-air exposition

<doc id="221760" wikidata="Q1269372" url="?curid=221760" title="Eastern marsh harrier">
<text>The eastern marsh harrier (Circus spilonotus) is a bird of prey belonging to the marsh harrier group of harriers. It was previously considered to be conspecific with the western marsh harrier (&quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot;) but is now usually classified as a separate species. It has two subspecies: &quot;C. s. spilonotus&quot; in eastern Asia and &quot;C. s. spilothorax&quot; ([[Papuan harrier]], perhaps a separate species) in New Guinea.

==Description==
It is 48 to 58 cm long with a wingspan of 113 to 137 cm; like most birds of prey, the female is usually larger than the male. The male&#x27;s plumage is variable; typically the head, breast, back and wing-coverts are blackish with pale streaks. The rest of the wing is grey with black wingtips and a white front edge. The tail is grey, the rump is white and the underparts are mostly white. The female is dark brown with buff streaking on the head and underparts. The rump is often whitish and the tail has dark bars. Young birds are dark brown with buff on the head and a pale patch on the underwing.

It is usually silent but has a mewing call which is most often uttered at roost sites.

==Distribution and habitat==
Eastern marsh harriers are generally migratory apart from the Papuan harrier which is sedentary. The breeding range covers north-east China, Mongolia and south-east Siberia (as far west as Lake Baikal) with small numbers in northern Japan (Hokkaidō and northern Honshū). There is some overlap with western marsh harrier around Lake Baikal and interbreeding has taken place.

The wintering range includes southern China, Taiwan, Korea, southern Japan, northeast India, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia as far south as the Philippines, Borneo and Sumatra. Large numbers of birds migrate along the Chinese coast with thousands passing through sites like Beidaihe during the autumn.

Its preferred habitat is open country including marshland, paddy fields and grassland.

==Diet and reproduction==
While hunting it flies low over the ground with the wings held in a shallow V-shape. Its prey includes small mammals, birds and frogs.

The breeding season begins in April. The nest is made of sticks and built on the ground, usually in a reedbed. Four to seven eggs are laid which are incubated for 33 to 48 days. The young birds fledge after 35 to 40 days.

<text>North American Aviation (NAA) was a major American aerospace manufacturer that designed and built several notable aircraft and spacecraft. Its products included the T-6 Texan trainer, the P-51 Mustang fighter, the B-25 Mitchell bomber, the F-86 Sabre jet fighter, the X-15 rocket plane, the XB-70 bomber, the B-1 Lancer, the Apollo command and service module, the second stage of the Saturn V rocket, and the Space Shuttle orbiter.

Through a series of mergers and sales, North American Aviation became part of North American Rockwell, which later became Rockwell International, and is now part of Boeing.

==History==

===Early years===
On December 6, 1928, Clement Melville Keys founded North American as a holding company that bought and sold interests in various airlines and aviation-related companies. However, the Air Mail Act of 1934 forced the breakup of such holding companies. North American became a manufacturing company, run by James H. &quot;Dutch&quot; Kindelberger, who had been recruited from Douglas Aircraft Company. NAA did retain ownership of Eastern Air Lines until 1938.

In 1933, the General Motors Corporation purchased a controlling interest in NAA, and merged it with the General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation, but retained the name North American Aviation.

Kindelberger moved the company&#x27;s operations from Dundalk, Maryland to Los Angeles, California, which allowed flying year-round, and decided to focus on training aircraft, on the theory that it would be easier than trying to compete with established companies on larger projects. NAA&#x27;s first planes were the GA-15 observation plane and the GA-16 trainer, followed by the O-47 and BT-9, also called the GA-16.

===World War II===

The BC-1 of 1937 was North American&#x27;s first combat aircraft; it was based on the GA-16. In 1940, like other manufacturers, North American started gearing up for war, opening factories in Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Texas, and Kansas City, Kansas. North American ranked eleventh among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.


North American&#x27;s follow-on to the BT-9 was the T-6 Texan trainer, of which 17,000 were built, making it the most widely used trainer ever. The twin-engine B-25 Mitchell bomber achieved fame in the Doolittle Raid and was used in all combat theaters of operation. The P-51 Mustang was initially produced for Britain as an alternative to the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, which North American had declined to produce under licence. The derivative A-36 Mustang was developed as a ground attack aircraft and dive bomber. This was done, in part, to keep the airframe in production as the US Army Air Corps had not yet decided to purchase the type as a fighter.

A suggestion by the RAF that North American switch the P-51&#x27;s powerplant from its original Allison engine to the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine may have been one of the most significant events in World War II aviation, as it transformed the P-51 into what many consider to be the best American fighter of the war.

Labor troubles became a grave issue in 1941. During the 22 months from August 1939 to June 1941 Stalin and Hitler supported each other as war raged in Europe. In the U.S., local union officials opposed American aid to Britain&#x27;s war against Germany. They called strikes in war industries that were supplying Lend Lease to Britain. The United Auto Workers (UAW) won the election over the International Association of Machinists and represented all the employees at the North American factory in Inglewood, California. UAW negotiators demanded the starting pay be raised from 50 cents an hour to 75 cents, plus a 10 cents raise for the 11,000 current employees. The national union had made a no-strike pledge but suddenly a wildcat strike by the local on June 5 closed the plant that produced a fourth of the fighters. The UAW national leader Richard Frankensteen flew in but was unable to get the workers to return. So Washington intervened. With the approval of national CIO leadership, President Franklin Roosevelt on June 8 sent in the California national guard to reopen the plant with bayonets. Strikers were told to return immediately or be drafted into the US Army. They sullenly complied. However, when Germany suddenly invaded the USSR on June 22, the Communist activists suddenly became the strongest supporters of war production; they crushed wildcat strikes.

===Post-war years===
Post-war, North American&#x27;s employment dropped from a high of 91,000 to 5,000 in 1946. On V-J Day, North American had orders from the U.S. government for 8,000 aircraft. A few months later, that had dropped to 24.

Two years later in 1948, General Motors divested NAA as a public company. Nevertheless, NAA continued with new designs, including the T-28 Trojan trainer and attack aircraft, the F-82 Twin Mustang fighter, B-45 Tornado jet bomber, the FJ Fury fighter, AJ Savage, the revolutionary XB-70 Valkyrie Mach-3 strategic bomber, Shrike Commander, and T-39 Sabreliner business jet.
The Columbus, Ohio division of North American Aviation was instrumental in the exclusive development and production of the A-5 Vigilante, an advanced high speed attack aircraft that saw significant use as a naval reconnaissance aircraft during the Vietnam War, the OV-10 Bronco, the first aircraft specifically designed for forward air control (FAC), and counter-insurgency (COIN) duties, and the T-2 Buckeye Naval trainer, which would serve from the late 1950s until 2008 and be flown in training by virtually every Naval Aviator and Naval Flight Officer in the US Navy and US Marine Corps for four decades. The Buckeye&#x27;s name would be an acknowledgment to the state tree of Ohio, as well as the mascot of Ohio State University.

The North American F-86 Sabre started out as a redesigned Fury and achieved fame shooting down MiGs in the Korean War. Over 9,000 F-86s were produced. Its successor, the North American F-100 Super Sabre, was also popular.

Some 6,656 F-86s were produced in the United States, the most produced postwar military aircraft in the West, as well as another 2,500 elsewhere. To accommodate its Sabre production, North American opened facilities in a former Curtiss-Wright plant in Columbus, Ohio. It also moved into a former Consolidated-Vultee Aircraft plant at Downey, California, and in 1948, built a new plant at Downey. By the end of 1952, North American sales topped $315 million. Employment at the Columbus plant grew from 1,600 in 1950 to 18,000 in 1952.

The cancellation of the F-107 and F-108 programs in the late 1950s, as well as the cancellation of the Navaho intercontinental cruise missile program, was a blow to North American from which it never fully recovered.

===Nuclear development===
Atomics International was a division of North American Aviation which began as the &quot;Atomic Energy Research Department&quot; at the Downey plant in 1948. In 1955, the department was renamed Atomics International and engaged principally in the early development of nuclear technology and nuclear reactors for both commercial and government applications. Atomics International was responsible for a number of accomplishments relating to nuclear energy: design, construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor in California (a small aqueous homogeneous reactor located at the NAA Downey plant), the first nuclear reactor to produce power for a commercial power grid in the United States (the Sodium Reactor Experiment located at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory) and the first nuclear reactor launched into outer space by the United States (the SNAP-10A). As overall interest in nuclear power declined, Atomics International transitioned to non-nuclear energy-related projects such as coal gasification and gradually ceased designing and testing nuclear reactors. Atomics International was eventually merged with the Rocketdyne division in 1978.

===Navigation and guidance, radar, and data systems===
Autonetics began in 1945 at North American&#x27;s Technical Research Laboratory, a small unit in the Los Angeles Division&#x27;s engineering department based in Downey, California. The evolution of the Navaho missile program resulted in the establishment of Autonetics as a separate division of North American Aviation in 1955, first located in Downey, later moving to Anaheim, California in 1963. The division was involved in the development of guidance systems for the Minuteman ballistic missile system.

===Space program===
In 1955, the rocket engine operations were spun off into a separate division as Rocketdyne. This division furnished engines for the Redstone, Jupiter, Thor, Delta, and Atlas missiles, and for NASA&#x27;s Saturn family of launch vehicles.

North American designed and built the airframe for the X-15, a rocket-powered aircraft that first flew in 1959.

In 1959, North American built the first of several Little Joe boosters used to test the launch escape system for the Project Mercury spacecraft. In 1960, the new CEO Lee Atwood decided to focus on the space program, and the company became the prime contractor for the Apollo command and service module, a larger Little Joe II rocket to test Apollo&#x27;s launch escape system, and the S-II second stage of the Saturn V.

===Merger and acquisition===
The fatal Apollo 1 fire in January 1967 was initially blamed on the company in the press, although a congressional hearing later ruled otherwise. In September, it merged with Rockwell-Standard, and the merged company became known as North American Rockwell. During this period the company continued its involvement with the Apollo program, building the Command and Service modules for all eleven missions. Within two years the new company also was studying concepts for the Space Shuttle, and won the orbiter contract in 1972. In 1973, the company changed its name again to Rockwell International and named its aircraft division North American Aircraft Operations.
Rockwell International&#x27;s defense and space divisions (including the North American Aviation divisions Autonetics and Rocketdyne) were sold to Boeing in December 1996. Initially called Boeing North American, these groups were integrated with Boeing&#x27;s Defense division. Rocketdyne was eventually sold by Boeing to UTC Pratt &amp; Whitney in 2005. UTC later sold Rocketdyne to Aerojet (GenCorp) in 2013.

<text>The swamp harrier (Circus approximans), also known as the Australasian marsh harrier or Australasian harrier, is a large, slim bird of prey widely distributed across Australasia. In New Zealand, it is also known by the Māori name . It arrived in New Zealand within the last 700 years, replacing the larger species, the extinct New Zealand endemic Eyles&#x27;s harrier.

The swamp harrier belongs to the subfamily Circinae and genus &quot;Circus&quot;, which are represented worldwide, except Antarctica. The subfamily and genus are derived from the characteristic behaviour of circling flight during courtship and hawking.

==Description==
The swamp harrier is largely dark brown, becoming lighter with age, and has a distinct white rump. It hunts by flying slowly, low to the ground, on upswept wings. The body length is , and the wingspan is . The recorded weights of adults range from . Females are significantly larger than the males. In New Zealand, 54 males averaged and 66 females averaged . Going on mean weights and linear measurements, the swamp harrier may be by a slight margin the largest extant species of harrier but it is only marginally larger than some other species, like the marsh harriers and the Réunion harrier.

==Distribution and habitat==
The swamp harrier is widespread through Australasia and many islands in the south-west Pacific region, including much of Australia (except the arid region), New Zealand (where it is common in open country), Fiji, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and as stragglers on some subantarctic islands. It is usually found in wetlands and well-watered open country.

The swamp harrier only became established in New Zealand within the last few hundred years, after lowland forests were extensively cleared by the first Polynesian settlers. It is absent from the fossil record. According to archeological and genetic research, humans arrived in New Zealand no earlier than about 1280, with at least the main settlement period between about 1320 and 1350, consistent with evidence based on genealogical traditions. The Eyles&#x27;s harrier (&quot;Circus teauteensis&quot;), a larger harrier species endemic to New Zealand, became extinct after human settlement. All swamp harrier remains from New Zealand that have been studied in detail are some 1000 years old at most, meaning that they post-date human settlement. There is no evidence for widespread coexistence of swamp and Eyles&#x27;s harriers in New Zealand. Apparently, despite their considerable differences, the two harriers were still ecologically similar enough to competitively exclude one another, and only when the endemic Eyles&#x27;s harrier became extinct could the swamp harrier become established.

The swamp harrier has benefited from European settlement, and is now very common, especially in open farmland.

==Behaviour==
Common enemies of harriers are Australian magpies, masked lapwings which dive bomb and European starlings which mob individuals. They have been known to kill the young of New Zealand falcons and have also been heavily blamed and persecuted for killing chickens, pheasants and ducklings. Swamp harriers are the only bird of prey used for falconry in New Zealand. The quarry is usually pūkeko and young rabbits.

===Diet===
The swamp harrier mainly feeds on ground birds and waterbirds, rabbits and other small mammals, reptiles, frogs, and fish. During the winter months harriers feed to a large extent on carrion, including roadkill, frequently falling victim to vehicles themselves.

===Breeding===
This species nests on the ground, often in wetlands, on a mound in reeds or other dense vegetation. In some districts they nest in fields of oats or barley. The clutch size may range from two to seven, but is usually three or four. The incubation period is 31 to 34 days, and is carried out by the female alone. Chicks are fed by both parents, are fully feathered by 28 days and fledging about 45 days after hatching.

<doc id="221765" wikidata="Q2791" url="?curid=221765" title="Geronimo">
<text>Gerónimo (, ; June 16, 1829 – February 17, 1909) was a military leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the Ndendahe Apache people. From 1850 to 1886, Geronimo joined with members of three other Central Apache bands the Tchihende, the Tsokanende (called Chiricahua by Americans) and the Nednhito carry out numerous raids, as well as fight against Mexican and U.S. military campaigns in the northern Mexico states of Chihuahua and Sonora and in the southwestern American territories of New Mexico and Arizona.

Geronimo&#x27;s raids and related combat actions were a part of the prolonged period of the Apache–United States conflict, which started with the Americans continuing to take land, including Apache lands, following the end of the war with Mexico in 1848. Reservation life was confining to the free-moving Apache people, and they resented restrictions on their customary way of life. Geronimo led breakouts from the reservations in attempts to return his people to their previous nomadic lifestyle. During Geronimo&#x27;s final period of conflict from 1876 to 1909, he surrendered three times and eventually accepted life on the Apache reservations. While well-known, Geronimo was not a chief of the Bedonkohe band of the Central Apache but a shaman, as was Nokay-doklini among the Western Apache. However, since he was a superb leader in raiding and warfare, he frequently led large numbers of 30 to 50 Apache men.

In 1886, after an intense pursuit in northern Mexico by American forces that followed Geronimo&#x27;s third 1885 reservation breakout, Geronimo surrendered for the last time to Lt. Charles Bare Gatewood. Geronimo and 27 other Apaches were later sent to join the rest of the Chiricahua tribe, which had been previously exiled to Florida. While holding him as a prisoner, the United States capitalized on Geronimo&#x27;s fame among non-Indians by displaying him at various fairs and exhibitions. In 1898, for example, Geronimo was exhibited at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha, Nebraska; seven years later, the Indian Office provided Geronimo for use in a parade at the second inauguration of President Theodore Roosevelt. He died at the Fort Sill hospital in 1909, as a prisoner of war, and was buried at the Fort Sill Indian Agency Cemetery, among the graves of relatives and other Apache prisoners of war.

==Background==
Apache is the collective term for several culturally related groups of Native Americans resident in the Southwest United States. The current division of Apachean groups includes the Western Apache, Yavapai, Coyotero, Aravaipa, Mojaves, Chiricahua, Tontos, Bylas, San Carlos, Mescalero, Jicarilla, Lipan and Plains Apache (formerly Kiowa-Apache). The first Apache raids on Sonora and Chihuahua took place in the late 17th century. To counter the early Apache raids on Spanish settlements, presidios were established at Janos (1685) in Chihuahua and at Fronteras (1690) in what is now northeastern Sonora, then Opata country. In 1835, Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps. Two years later, Mangas Coloradas became principal chief and war leader and began a series of raids against the Mexicans. Apache raids on Mexican villages were so numerous and brutal that no area was safe. Between 1820 and 1835 alone, some 5,000 Mexicans died in Apache raids, and 100 settlements were destroyed.

During the decades of Apache-Mexican and Apache-United States conflicts, raiding had become embedded in the Apache way of life, used for strategic purposes as well as economic enterprise. Speaking of the start of the Spanish/Mexican Apache conflict, Debo states, &quot;Thus the Apaches were driven into the mountains and raiding the settled communities became a way of life for them, an economic enterprise as legitimate as gathering berries or hunting deer&quot; and often there was overlap between raids for economic need and warfare. Raids ranged from stealing livestock and other plunder, to the capture and/or killing of victims, sometimes by torture. Mexicans and Americans responded with retaliatory attacks against the Apache which were no less violent and were very seldom limited to identified individual adult enemies, much like the Apache raids. The raiding and retaliation fed the fires of a virulent revenge warfare that reverberated back and forth between Apaches and Mexicans and later, Apaches and Americans. From 1850 to 1886, Geronimo, as well as other Apache leaders, conducted attacks, but Geronimo was driven by a desire to take revenge for the murder of his family by Mexican soldiers and accumulated a record of brutality during this time that was unmatched by any of his contemporaries. His fighting ability extending over 30 years forms a major characteristic of his persona.

Within Geronimo&#x27;s own Chiricahua tribe, many had mixed feelings about him. While respected as a skilled and effective leader of raids or warfare, he emerges as not very likable, and he was not widely popular among the other Apaches. This was primarily because he refused to give in to American government demands, causing some Apaches to fear the American response. Nevertheless, the Apache people stood in awe of Geronimo&#x27;s powers, which he demonstrated to them on a series of occasions. These powers indicated to other Apaches that Geronimo had supernatural gifts that he could use for good or ill. In eyewitness accounts by other Apaches, Geronimo was able to become aware of distant events as they happened, and he was able to anticipate future events. He also demonstrated powers to heal other Apaches.

==Biography==
Geronimo was born to the Bedonkohe band of the Apache near Turkey Creek, a tributary of the Gila River in the modern-day state of New Mexico, then part of Mexico, though the Apache disputed Mexico&#x27;s claim. His grandfather, Mahko, had been chief of the Bedonkohe Apache. He had three brothers and four sisters.

His parents raised him according to Apache traditions. After the death of his father, his mother took him to live with the Tchihende, and he grew up with them. Geronimo married a woman named Alope, from the Nedni-Chiricahua band of Apache, when he was 17; they had three children. She was the first of nine wives.

=== Massacre at Janos ===
On March 5, 1851, a company of 400 Mexican soldiers from Sonora led by Colonel José María Carrasco attacked Geronimo&#x27;s camp outside Janos (Kas-Ki-Yeh in Apache) while the men were in town trading. Carrasco claimed he had followed the Apaches to Janos, Chihuahua, after they had conducted a raid in Sonora, taken livestock and other plunder and badly defeated Mexican militia. Among those killed in Carrasco&#x27;s attack were Geronimo&#x27;s wife, children and mother. The loss of his family led Geronimo to hate all Mexicans for the rest of his life; he and his followers would frequently attack and kill any group of Mexicans that they encountered. Throughout Geronimo&#x27;s adult life his antipathy toward, suspicion of, and dislike for Mexicans was demonstrably greater than for Americans.

Recalling that at the time his band was at peace with the Mexicans, Geronimo remembered the incident as follows:Late one afternoon when returning from town we were met by a few women and children who told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous – a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, I found that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain.
=== War with Mexico ===
Geronimo&#x27;s chief, Mangas Coloradas (Spanish for &quot;red sleeves&quot;), sent him to Cochise&#x27;s band for help in his revenge against the Mexicans. It was during this incident that the name &quot;Geronimo&quot; came about. This appellation stemmed from a battle in which, ignoring a deadly hail of bullets, he repeatedly attacked Mexican soldiers with a knife. The origin of the name is a source of controversy with historians, some writing that it was appeals by the soldiers to Saint Jerome (&quot;Jerónimo!&quot;) for help. Debo repeats this, speculating also an alternative unlikely in terms of phonetics, that it may have been &quot;as close as they [Mexican soldiers] could come to the choking sounds that composed his name.&quot;

Attacks and counterattacks with Mexicans were common. In December 1860, 30 miners began a surprise attack on an encampment of Bedonkohes Apaches on the west bank of the Mimbres River. According to historian Edwin R. Sweeney, the miners &quot;killed four Indians, wounded others, and captured thirteen women and children.&quot; Attacks by the Apache again followed, with raids against U.S. citizens and property.

In 1873 the Mexicans once again attacked the Apache. After months of fighting in the mountains, the Apaches and Mexicans decided on a peace treaty at Casas Grandes. After terms were agreed, the Mexican troops gave mezcal to the Apaches, and while they were intoxicated, they attacked and killed 20 Apaches and captured some. The Apache were forced to retreat into the mountains once again.

Though outnumbered, Geronimo fought against both Mexican and United States troops and became famous for his daring exploits and numerous escapes from incarceration from 1858 to 1886. One such escape, as legend has it, took place in the Robledo Mountains of southwest New Mexico. The legend states that Geronimo and his followers entered a cave, and the U.S. soldiers waited outside the entrance for him, but he never came out. Later, it was heard that Geronimo was spotted outside, nearby. The second entrance through which he escaped has yet to be found, and the cave is called Geronimo&#x27;s Cave, even though no reference to this event or this cave has been found in the historic or oral record. Moreover, there are many stories of this type with other caves referenced that state that Geronimo or other Apaches entered to escape troops but were not seen exiting. These stories are in all likelihood apocryphal.

===Geronimo campaign===
The Apache–United States conflict was a direct outgrowth of the much older Apache–Mexican conflict which had been ongoing in the same general area since the beginning of Mexican/Spanish settlement during the 17th century.
While Apaches were shielded from the violence of warfare on the reservation, disability and death from diseases like malaria were much more prevalent. On the other hand, rations were provided by the government, though at times the corruption of Indian agents caused rationing to become perilously scarce. The people, who had lived as semi-nomads for generations, disliked the restrictive reservation system. Rebelling against reservation life, other Apache leaders had led their bands in &quot;breakouts&quot; from the reservations.

On three occasions – April or August 1878; September 1881; and May 1885 – Geronimo led his band of followers in breakouts from the reservation to return to their former nomadic life associated with raiding and warfare. Following each breakout, Geronimo and his band would flee across Arizona and New Mexico to Mexico, killing and plundering as they went, and establish a new base in the rugged and remote Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains. In Mexico, they were insulated from pursuit by U.S. armed forces. The Apache knew the rough terrain of the Sierras intimately, which helped them elude pursuit and protected them from attack. The Sierra Madre mountains lie on the border between the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua, which allowed the Apache access to raid and plunder the small villages, haciendas, wagon trains, worker camps and travelers in both states. From Mexico, Apache bands also staged surprise raids back into the United States, often seeking to replenish their supply of guns and ammunition. Utley refers to a specific raid in March 1883, in which Geronimo&#x27;s people split up with Geronimo and Chihuahua raiding in the Sonora River valley to collect livestock and provisions, while Chatto and Bonito raided through southern Arizona to gather weapons and cartridges. In these raids into the United States, the Apaches moved swiftly and attacked isolated ranches, wagon trains, prospectors and travelers. They often killed all the persons they encountered in order to avoid detection and pursuit as long as possible before they slipped back over the border into Mexico.

The &quot;breakouts&quot; and the subsequent resumption of Apache raiding and warfare caused the Mexican Army and militia as well as United States forces to pursue and attempt to kill or apprehend off-reservation &quot;renegade&quot; Apache bands, including Geronimo&#x27;s, wherever they could be found. Because the Mexican army and militia units of Sonora and Chihuahua were unable to suppress the several Chiricahua bands based in the Sierra Madre mountains, in 1883 Mexico allowed the United States to send troops into Mexico to continue their pursuit of Geronimo&#x27;s band and the bands of other Apache leaders.


On May 17, 1885, a number of Apache including Nana, Mangus (son of Mangas Coloradas), Chihuahua, Naiche, Geronimo, and their followers fled the San Carlos Reservation in Arizona after a show of force against the reservation&#x27;s commanding officer Britton Davis. Department of Arizona General George Crook dispatched two columns of troops into Mexico, the first commanded by Captain Emmet Crawford and the second by Captain Wirt Davis. Each was composed of a troop of cavalry (usually about forty men) and about 100 Apache Scouts recruited from among the Apache people. These Apache units proved effective in finding the mountain strongholds of the Apache bands and killing or capturing them. It was highly unsettling for Geronimo&#x27;s band to realize their own tribesmen had helped find their hiding places. They pursued the Apache through the summer and autumn through Mexican Chihuahua and back across the border into the United States. The Apache continually raided settlements, murdering other innocent Native Americans and civilians and stealing horses. Over time this persistent pursuit by both Mexican and American forces discouraged Geronimo and other similar Apache leaders, and caused a steady and irreplaceable attrition of the members of their bands, which taken all together eroded their will to resist and led to their ultimate capitulation.

Crook was under increased pressure from the government in Washington. He launched a second expedition into Mexico, and on January 9, 1886, Crawford located Geronimo and his band. His Apache Scouts attacked the next morning and captured the Apache&#x27;s herd of horses and their camp equipment. The Apaches were demoralized and agreed to negotiate for surrender. Before the negotiations could be concluded, Mexican troops arrived and mistook the Apache Scouts for the enemy Apache. The Mexican government had accused the scouts of taking advantage of their position to conduct theft, robbery, and murder in Mexico. They attacked and killed Captain Crawford. Lt. Maus, the senior officer, met with Geronimo, who agreed to meet with General Crook. Geronimo named as the meeting place the Cañon de los Embudos (Canyon of the Funnels), in the Sierra Madre Mountains about from Fort Bowie and about south of the international border, near the Sonora/Chihuahua border.

During the three days of negotiations in March 1886, photographer C. S. Fly took about 15 exposures of the Apache on glass negatives. One of the pictures of Geronimo with two of his sons standing alongside was made at Geronimo&#x27;s request. Fly&#x27;s images are the only existing photographs of Geronimo&#x27;s surrender. His photos of Geronimo and the other free Apaches, taken on March 25 and 26, are the only known photographs taken of an American Indian while still at war with the United States. Among the Indians was a white boy Jimmy McKinn, also photographed by Fly, who had been abducted from his ranch in New Mexico in September 1885.

Geronimo, camped on the Mexican side of the border, agreed to Crook&#x27;s surrender terms. That night, a soldier who sold them whiskey said that his band would be murdered as soon as they crossed the border. Geronimo, Nachite, and 39 of his followers slipped away during the night. Crook exchanged a series of heated telegrams with General Philip Sheridan defending his men&#x27;s actions, until on April 1, 1886, when he sent a telegram asking Sheridan to relieve him of command, to which Sheridan agreed.
Sheridan replaced Crook with General Nelson A. Miles. In 1886, Miles selected Captain Henry Lawton to command B Troop, 4th Cavalry, at Fort Huachuca, and First Lieutenant Charles B. Gatewood, to lead the expedition that brought Geronimo and his followers back to the reservation system for a final time. Lawton was given orders to head up actions south of the U.S.–Mexico boundary, where it was thought that Geronimo and a small band of his followers would take refuge from U.S. authorities. Lawton was to pursue, subdue, and return Geronimo, dead or alive, to the United States.

Lawton&#x27;s official report dated September 9, 1886, sums up the actions of his unit and gives credit to a number of his troops for their efforts. Geronimo gave Gatewood credit for his decision to surrender as Gatewood was well known to Geronimo, spoke some Apache, and was familiar with and honored their traditions and values. He acknowledged Lawton&#x27;s tenacity for wearing the Apaches down with constant pursuit. Geronimo and his followers had little or no time to rest or stay in one place. Completely worn out, the small band of Apaches returned to the U.S. with Lawton and officially surrendered to General Miles on September 4, 1886, at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona.

When Geronimo surrendered, he had in his possession a Winchester Model 1876 lever-action rifle with a silver-washed barrel and receiver, bearing Serial Number 109450. It is on display at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York. Additionally, he had a Colt Single Action Army revolver with a nickel finish and ivory stocks bearing Serial Number 89524, and a Sheffield Bowie knife with a dagger type blade and a stag handle made by George Wostenholm in an elaborate silver-studded holster and cartridge belt. The revolver, rig, and knife are on display at the Fort Sill museum.

The debate remains as to whether Geronimo surrendered unconditionally. He repeatedly insisted in his memoirs that his people who surrendered had been misled, and that his surrender as a war prisoner in front of uncontested witnesses (especially General Stanley) was conditional. General Oliver O. Howard, chief of US Army Division of the Pacific, said on his part that Geronimo&#x27;s surrender was accepted as that of a dangerous outlaw without condition. Howard&#x27;s account was contested in front of the US Senate.

According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;the governor of Sonora claimed in 1886 that in the last five months of Geronimo&#x27;s wild career, his band of 16 warriors slaughtered some 500 to 600 Mexicans.&quot; At the end of his military career, he led a small band of 38 men, women and children. They evaded thousands of Mexican and American troops for more than a year, making him the most famous Native American of the time and earning him the title of the &quot;worst Indian who ever lived&quot; among white settlers. According to James L. Haley, &quot;About two weeks after the escape there was a report of a family massacred near Silver City; one girl was taken alive and hanged from a meat hook jammed under the base of her skull.&quot; His band was one of the last major forces of independent Native American warriors who refused to accept the United States occupation of the American West.

===Prisoner of war===

Geronimo and other Apaches, including the Apache Scouts who had helped the Army track him down, were sent as prisoners to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. The Army held them there for about six weeks before they were sent to Fort Pickens in Pensacola, Florida. This prompt action prevented the Arizona civil authorities from intervening to arrest and try Geronimo for the death of the many Americans who had been killed during the previous decades of raiding.

&quot;In that alien climate,&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported, &quot;the Apache died &#x27;like flies at frost time.&#x27; Businessmen there soon had the idea to have Geronimo serve as a tourist attraction, and hundreds of visitors daily were let into the fort to lay eyes on the &#x27;bloodthirsty&#x27; Indian in his cell.&quot; While the prisoners of war were in Florida, the government relocated hundreds of their children from their Arizona reservation to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. More than a third of the students quickly perished from tuberculosis, &quot;died as though smitten with the plague&quot;, the &quot;Post&quot; reported.

The Chiricahuas remained at Fort Pickens until 1888 when they were relocated to Mt. Vernon Barracks in Alabama, where they were reunited with their families. After 1/4 of the population died of tuberculosis, the Chiricahuas, including Geronimo, were relocated to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1894; they built villages scattered around the post based on kindred groups. Geronimo, like other Apaches, was given a plot of land on which he took up farming activities. On the train ride to Fort Sill, many tourists wanted a memento of Geronimo, so they paid 25 cents for a button that he cut off his shirt or a hat he took off his head. As the train would pull into depots along the way, Geronimo would buy more buttons to sew on and more hats to sell.

In 1898 Geronimo was part of a Chiricahua delegation from Fort Sill to the Trans-Mississippi International Exposition in Omaha, Nebraska. Previous newspaper accounts of the Apache Wars had impressed the public with Geronimo&#x27;s name and exploits, and in Omaha he became a major attraction. The Omaha Exposition gave Geronimo celebrity status, and for the rest of his life he was in demand as an attraction in fairs large and small. The two largest were the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, New York, in 1901, and the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair in 1904. Under Army guard, Geronimo dressed in traditional clothing and posed for photographs and sold his crafts.

After the fair, Pawnee Bill&#x27;s Wild West shows brokered an agreement with the government to have Geronimo join the show, again under Army guard. The Indians in Pawnee Bill&#x27;s shows were depicted as &quot;lying, thieving, treacherous, murderous&quot; monsters who had killed hundreds of men, women and children and would think nothing of taking a scalp from any member of the audience, given the chance. Visitors came to see how the &quot;savage&quot; had been &quot;tamed,&quot; and they paid Geronimo to take a button from the coat of the vicious Apache &quot;chief.&quot; (Geronimo was not a chief.) The shows put a good deal of money in his pockets and allowed him to travel though never without government guards.
In President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s 1905 Inaugural Parade, Geronimo rode horseback down Pennsylvania Avenue with five Indian chiefs who wore full headgear and painted faces. The intent, one newspaper stated, was to show Americans &quot;that they have buried the hatchet forever.&quot; They created a sensation and brought the crowds to their feet along the parade route. Later that same week Geronimo met with Roosevelt and made a request for the Chiricahuas at Fort Sill to be relieved of their status as prisoners of war and allowed to return to their homeland in Arizona. President Roosevelt refused, referring to the continuing animosity in Arizona for the deaths of civilian men, women, and children associated with Geronimo&#x27;s raids during the prolonged Apache Wars. Through an interpreter, Roosevelt told Geronimo that the Indian had a &quot;bad heart&quot;. &quot;You killed many of my people; you burned villages…and were not good Indians.&quot; Roosevelt responded that he would &quot;see how you and your people act&quot; on the reservation.

In 1905, Geronimo agreed to tell his story to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barrett had to appeal to President Roosevelt to gain permission to publish the book. Geronimo came to each interview knowing exactly what he wanted to say. He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. He expressed himself in Spanish. Barrett did not seem to take many liberties with Geronimo&#x27;s story as translated into English by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett&#x27;s footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.

When I was at first asked to attend the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair I did not wish to go. Later, when I was told that I would receive good attention and protection, and that the President of the United States said that it would be all right, I consented ... Every Sunday the President of the Fair sent for me to go to a wild west show. I took part in the roping contests before the audience. There were many other Indian tribes there, and strange people of whom I had never heard ... I am glad I went to the Fair. I saw many interesting things and learned much of the white people. They are a very kind and peaceful people. During all the time I was at the Fair no one tried to harm me in any way. Had this been among the Mexicans I am sure I should have been compelled to defend myself often.

Later that year, the Indian Office took him to Texas, where he shot a buffalo in a roundup staged by 101 Ranch Real Wild West for the National Editorial Association. Geronimo was escorted to the event by soldiers, as he was still a prisoner. The teachers who witnessed the staged buffalo hunt were unaware that Geronimo&#x27;s people were not buffalo hunters.

===Death===
In February 1909, Geronimo was thrown from his horse while riding home and lay in the cold all night until a friend found him extremely ill. He died of pneumonia on February 17, 1909, as a prisoner of the United States at Fort Sill. On his deathbed, he confessed to his nephew that he regretted his decision to surrender. His last words were reported to be said to his nephew, &quot;I should have never surrendered. I should have fought until I was the last man alive.&quot; He was buried at Fort Sill in the Beef Creek Apache Cemetery.

== Family ==
 Geronimo married Chee-hash-kish, and they had two children, Chappo and Dohn-say. Then he took another wife, Nana-tha-thtith, with whom he had one child. He later had a wife named Zi-yeh at the same time as another wife, She-gha, one named Shtsha-she and later a wife named Ih-tedda. Geronimo&#x27;s ninth and last wife was Azul.

One of Gernimo&#x27;s daughters, likely Dohn-say, was married to Zebina Streeter. Although Streeter was well respected by Geronimo&#x27;s band and referred to as &quot;White Apache&quot;, it was shameful to acknowledge the relationship, as intermarriage with whites was considered dishonorable.

The great-great-grandson of Geronimo, Harlyn Geronimo, taught Apache language lessons at the Mescalero Apache Reservation until his death in 2020.

== Religion ==

Geronimo was raised with the traditional religion of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his opinions concerning life after death, he wrote in his 1905 autobiography: As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death ... We held that the discharge of one&#x27;s duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.
In his later years Geronimo endorsed Christianity and stated:

Since my life as a prisoner has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man&#x27;s religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers ... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it seems to me the best religion in enabling one to live right.

He joined the Dutch Reformed Church in 1903 but four years later was expelled for gambling. To the end of his life, he seemed to harbor ambivalent religious feelings, telling the Christian missionaries at a summer camp meeting in 1908 that he wanted to start over, while at the same time telling his tribesmen that he held to the old Apache religion.

== Alleged theft of Geronimo&#x27;s skull ==
Six members of the Yale secret society Skull and Bones, including Prescott Bush, served as Army volunteers at Fort Sill during World War I. In 1986, former San Carlos Apache chairman Ned Anderson received an anonymous letter with a photograph and a copy of a log book claiming that Skull and Bones held the skull of Geronimo. He met with Skull and Bones representatives about the rumor. The group&#x27;s attorney, Endicott P. Davidson, denied that the group held the skull and said that the 1918 ledger saying otherwise was a hoax. The group offered Anderson a glass case like the one in the photograph containing what appeared to be the skull of a child, but Anderson refused it.
In 2006, Marc Wortman discovered a 1918 letter from Skull and Bones member Winter Mead to F. Trubee Davison that claimed the theft:

The second &quot;Tomb&quot; refers to the building of Yale University&#x27;s Skull and Bones society. The revelation led Harlyn Geronimo to write to President George W. Bush (the grandson of Prescott Bush) requesting his help in returning the remains:

However, the implications of the letter are debatable. Mead was not at Fort Sill, so he could not have personally witnessed the robbery, and Cameron University history professor David H. Miller notes that Geronimo&#x27;s grave was unmarked at the time.

In 2009, Ramsey Clark filed a lawsuit on behalf of people claiming descent from Geronimo, against several parties including Robert Gates and Skull and Bones, asking for the return of Geronimo&#x27;s bones. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that Clark &quot;acknowledged he had no hard proof that the story was true.&quot; Investigators, including Bush family biographer Kitty Kelley and the pseudonymous Cecil Adams, say the story is untrue. A military spokesman from Fort Sill told Adams, &quot;There is no evidence to indicate the bones are anywhere but in the grave site.&quot; Jeff Houser, chairman of the Fort Sill Apache tribe of Oklahoma, calls the story a hoax. In 1928, the Army covered Geronimo&#x27;s grave with concrete and provided a stone monument, making any possible examination of remains difficult. In 2010, the court dismissed the case, deciding that Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) only applies to events that occurred after 1990. The court did not rule about the claim concerning Skull and Bones perhaps because NAGPRA does not apply to private organizations.
==Military usage==
===Paratroopers===

Inspired by the 1939 film &quot;Geronimo&quot;, U.S. Army paratroopers testing the practice of parachuting from planes began a tradition of shouting &quot;Geronimo!&quot; to show they had no fear of jumping out of an airplane. Other Native American-based traditions were also adopted in WWII, such as &quot;Mohawk&quot; haircuts, face paint, and sporting spears on their unit patches. The paratrooper unit 1/509th PIR at Fort Johnson, LA, uses Geronimo as their moniker.

===Code name===

The United States military used the code name &quot;Geronimo&quot; for the raid that killed Al-Qaeda terrorist Osama bin Laden in 2011, but its use outraged some Native Americans. It was subsequently reported to be named or renamed &quot;Operation Neptune Spear&quot;.

Harlyn Geronimo, known to be Geronimo&#x27;s great-grandson, said to the Senate Commission on Indian Affairs:

==Commemorations==
Three towns in the U.S. are named after Geronimo: one each in Arizona, Oklahoma, and Texas. Also named after him was the SS &quot;Geronimo&quot;, a WWII Liberty ship. In the U.S. Postal Service&#x27;s serial &quot;Legends of the West&quot;, a 29¢ postage stamp showing Geronimo was issued on October 18, 1994.

==In popular culture==
===Music===
&quot;Geronimo&quot; is a track recorded by Les Elgart and his orchestra on their &quot;Sophisticated Swing&quot; album (Columbia CL-536; 1953). The British instrumental rock group The Shadows released a single “Geronimo” in 1963, written by group member Hank Marvin. It stalled at number 11 in the British charts, their lowest since breaking through in 1960 with the charttopping Apache. In 1972, Michael Martin Murphey&#x27;s song &quot;Geronimo&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; was inspired by Walter Ferguson&#x27;s photo of Geronimo sitting in a luxury Locomobile. The song hit number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and it was later covered by Cher and Hoyt Axton. The German duo Modern Talking released a different song with the same title (but with a less explicit lyrical connection to Geronimo) in 1986. In 1991 Vinnie James released &quot;All American Boy&quot; with the track &quot;Hey Geronimo&quot; about Geronimo&#x27;s life and the line &quot;still stealing your horses&quot;. In 2014, the indie pop band Sheppard released &quot;Geronimo&quot;, which reached number one on the Australian Singles Chart in April that year. In 2019 the American Red-Dirt Country band Shane Smith and the Saints, released in 2015, their second studio album &quot;Geronimo&quot; was released on Geronimo West Records. This album has the title track &quot;Geronimo&quot;.

===Film===
Geronimo has been featured in many western movies; for example, in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), it is Geronimo&#x27;s band that chases the stagecoach across Monument Valley. There are four films in which he is the title character. In &quot;Geronimo!&quot; (also 1939), directed by Paul Sloane, he is played by Chief Thundercloud but only in a supporting role as the film is essentially about the U.S. Army&#x27;s attempts to capture him. However, in the similarly titled &quot;Geronimo!&quot; (1962), directed by Arnold Laven, Geronimo as played by Chuck Connors is the main character.

In 1993, two films about Geronimo were released within a few days of each other. &quot;&quot; is about his arrest, and he is played by Native American actor Wes Studi. The biopic &quot;Geronimo&quot; has a wider scope, and he is played by Native American actor Joseph Runningfox.

===Television and radio===
On June 29, 1938, a fictionalized Geronimo appeared in a radio episode of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, titled &quot;Three Against Geronimo&quot;. In the episode, Tonto acts as a spy to discover Geronimo&#x27;s plan to take Fort Custer under a false flag of peace. Tonto strips Geronimo of his concealed knife before the Lone Ranger and a cavalryman named Peterson lure Geronimo&#x27;s troops into the emptied fort one at a time.

In the TV series &quot;Stories of the Century&quot; the episode &quot;Geronimo&quot; was aired on February 14, 1954. &quot;Geronimo&quot; was the title of episode 21 of the ABC western series &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot;. The episode was first broadcast on March 5, 1958, with John Doucette playing the part of Geronimo. Geronimo, played by Enrique Lucero, features prominently in the 1979 miniseries &quot;Mr. Horn&quot;, starring David Carradine as Tom Horn.

In the TV series&quot;The Politician&quot; in the third episode of the second season a photo of the protagonist is shown in which he was disguised in clothes inspired by Geronimo. This led, within the series, to a conflict for which the protagonist is accused of cultural appropriation.

===Video games===
Geronimo was a character featured in the hit mobile game Fate/Grand Order.

<text>The Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) or just hobby, is a small, slim falcon. It belongs to a group of similar falcons often considered a subgenus &quot;Hypotriorchis&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The first formal description of the Eurasian hobby was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the present binomial name &quot;Falco subbuteo&quot;. The genus name &quot;falco&quot; derives from Late Latin &quot;falx&quot;, &quot;falcis&quot;, a sickle, referring to the wing profile of the bird. The species name &quot;subbuteo&quot; is from Latin &quot;sub&quot;, &quot;below, less than, under&quot; and &quot;buteo&quot;, &quot;buzzard&quot;. The species&#x27; English name comes from Old French &quot;hobé&quot; or &quot;hobet&quot;. It became the trademark for the Subbuteo games company after its creator, who was an ornithologist, was refused permission to register &quot;Hobby&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;F. s. subbuteo&quot;: the nominate race is resident in Africa, Europe and Central and East Asia, winters in Central and South Africa and South Asia
* &quot;F. s. streichi&quot;: described by Ernst Hartert and Oscar Neumann in 1907, is smaller in size and is a resident species from Myanmar to south China and north Indochina.

==Description==
Adults are slate-grey above with a dark crown and two short black moustache stripes. The throat is unstreaked white, thighs and undertail coverts are unstreaked rufous and rest of the underparts are whitish with black streaks. Close views enable the red &quot;trousers&quot; and vent to be seen. Sexes are similar. Juveniles are generally much browner, with scaled upper parts and streaked buffy thighs and undertail coverts.

The hobby has a distinct first-summer plumage.

This falcon is in length with a wingspan of and a weight of .

==Distribution and habitat==
This species breeds across the Palearctic realm. The subspecies &quot;F. s. subbuteo&quot; is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa. The subspecies &quot;F. s. streichi&quot; is mainly resident and does not migrate.

==Behaviour and ecology==

It is a bird of open country such as farmland, marshes, taiga and savannah. They are widespread in lowlands with scattered small woods. It is an elegant bird of prey, appearing sickle-like in flight with its long pointed wings and square tail, often resembling a swift when gliding with folded wings. It is fast and powerful in flight and will take large insects, such as dragonflies, which it transfers from talons to beak and eats while soaring slowly in circles. It also captures small bats and small birds in flight. Its speed and aerobatic skills enable it to take swallows and even swifts on the wing, and barn swallows or house martins have a characteristic &quot;hobby&quot; alarm call. It is known to harass swallows while they are roosting and dispersing from roosts. When not breeding, it is crepuscular, hawking principally in the mornings and evenings. While on migration, they may move in small groups.

Hobbies nest in old nests of crows and other birds. The tree selected is most often one in a hedge or on the extreme edge of a , from where the bird can observe intruders from a considerable distance. It lays 2–4 eggs. Incubation is said to take 28 days and both parents share in this duty, though the female does the greater part.

It is a very bold and courageous bird and was used in falconry, trained to hawk birds like quails, larks, hoopoes, drongos, etc.
