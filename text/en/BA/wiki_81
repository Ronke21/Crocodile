<text>Tar pits, sometimes referred to as asphalt pits, are large asphalt deposits. They form in the presence of petroleum, which is created when decayed organic matter is subjected to pressure underground. If this crude oil seeps upward via fractures, conduits, or porous sedimentary rock layers, it may pool up at the surface. The lighter components of the crude oil evaporate into the atmosphere, leaving behind a black, sticky asphalt. Tar pits are often excavated because they contain large fossil collections.

Tar pits form above oil reserves, and these deposits are often found in anticlinal traps. In fact, about 80 percent of petroleum found on Earth has been found in anticlinal traps. Anticlines are folds in stratigraphic layers in which each half of the fold dips away from the crest. Such structures are usually developed above thrust faults or in tectonic regions where the land is bending and folding. If the structure above the concave-down fold (arch) is a non-porous rock or aquitard, such as shale, it is considered an anticlinal trap. The figure in this section is a cartoon cross-section diagram that shows oil stuck in an anticlinal trap. If there is a fault or fracture in the overlying strata above the oil reserve, the oil may migrate to the surface. This is possible by capillary fringe and because oil is less dense than water.

== Chemistry ==
Tar pits are pools of asphalt. However, at the beginning of their formation, they were not always sticky and dense. The pools were composed of crude oil that originated below Earth&#x27;s surface. Crude oil is a mixture of heteroatom compounds, hydrocarbons, metals, and inorganic compounds. Heteroatom compounds are organic molecules that contain elements that are not carbon or hydrogen, while hydrocarbons contain only carbon and hydrogen. Crude oil is less viscous than asphalt because it contains a higher percentage of light hydrocarbons. Light hydrocarbons include the following alkanes: methane, ethane, propane, and butane. These molecules have very low molecular weights. Crude oils may also contain some inorganic impurities, such as CO2, H2S, N2, and O2. At the surface, these light molecules may evaporate out of the crude oil, leaving behind the heavier, stickier molecules. Asphalt, or bitumen, usually contains hydrocarbon molecule chains with 50+ carbon atoms. The longer the hydrocarbon chain, the more viscous it becomes, and the boiling point increases.  

Evaporation is an important process in the formation of tar pits. A reservoir of light crude oil on Earth&#x27;s surface can be reduced by up to 75% of the initial volume just after a few days, forming asphalt as the resulting product. For medium crude oils, the volume may be reduced by 40%. Crude oils will evaporate differently depending on their chemical composition. The average composition of a bitumen sample by weight is 80.2% carbon, 7.5% hydrogen, 7.6% oxygen, 1.7% nitrogen, and 3.0% sulfur.

== Notable tar pits ==

=== La Brea ===
The La Brea Tar Pits are located in Los Angeles. The petroleum that is seen on the surface is sourced from the Salt Lake Oil Field reservoir and the oil sands in the Repetto and Pico formations. These oil deposits were formed during the Miocene Epoch when marine plankton organisms accumulated in an ocean basin. Over time, sediments buried the organisms 300 to 1000 meters below Earth&#x27;s surface, subjecting them to high pressures. This process turned the organic matter into oil. The 6th Street Fault that cuts through the Salt Lake Oil Field is the conduit that feeds the La Brea Tar Pits. Petroleum migrated to the surface over time, trapping and preserving animals and plants for the past 50,000 years.

=== Carpinteria ===
The Carpinteria Tar Pits are located in Tar Pits Park in Carpinteria, California. These tar pits were predicted to have formed during the Pleistocene. During an excavation project, 25 plant species were recovered along with 55 species of birds and 26 species of mammals. Springs of tar still ooze to the surface through fractures in the underlying stratigraphic layers of marine shale.

=== Binagadi Asphalt Lake ===
The Binagadi Asphalt Lake is located in Azerbaijan, or in the Caucasus, a region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. This tar pit is known for preserving the heads and bodies of multiple cave lions, a mammal that flourished in the Pleistocene. A well-preserved horse skull was also found in the Binagadi asphalt lake. It is estimated to be 96-120 thousand years old. It is on display at the Natural-Historical Museum of Azerbaijan in Baku, Azerbaijan.

=== Pitch Lake ===
The large, bowl-like depression filled with bitumen in Trinidad and Tobago. The lake has a maximum depth of 250 feet with an area of 100 acres, making it the largest deposit of solid bitumen on Earth. The lake is cold and dense near the shores, and it has a top layer that can be walked on. Underneath this skin, the asphalt is continuously churning. The lake gets gradually softer and hotter near the center where the bitumen begins to bubble. The gas being released in the middle of the lake is largely methane and an ample amount of carbon dioxide.

Pitch Lake formed thousands of years ago in the presence of tectonic activity. Movement along a fault created a fracture that tapped into an oil and gas reservoir deep within the crust. The oil and gas seeped upward to Earth&#x27;s surface through the fracture over time, creating Pitch Lake. Due to this constant replenishment of the oil and gas, the lake has a slight current. The current is largely unnoticed because the top layer of Pitch Lake is mostly solid.

==Fossils==
Tar pits are characteristic of their many fossils. This is the case because the thick, sticky asphalt traps animals.  Once animals step into the tar, they become immobilized and begin sinking immediately if the asphalt is warm and sticky enough. Predators that see these helpless animals usually would advance into the tar pits with the hope of catching their next meal. As a result, prey are usually found beneath the predator during excavation projects.

The bones and hard parts of the animals are well preserved because they are buried rapidly after the organism&#x27;s death. Beneath the surface, the hard parts are engulfed with asphalt, and they are protected from climate variations like rain, wind, or snow that may accelerate weathering processes. Asphalt also lacks oxygen and water, so major decomposing organisms like aerobic fungi and bacteria are absent.

In the La Brea Tar Pits, more than one million bones have been recovered since 1906. 231 vertebrate species, 234 invertebrate species, and 159 plant species have been identified. The most frequent large mammal found in the La Brea Tar Pits is the dire wolf, one of the most famous prehistoric carnivores that lived during the Pleistocene. Fossils from saber-toothed cats and coyotes were also abundant. Additional fossils are constantly being discovered through continued excavation projects.

==Living organisms==
Life was found in a ca. 28,000-year-old sample of natural asphalt in the La Brea Tar Pits. Hundreds of new species of bacteria were discovered that have the ability to thrive in environments with little to no water or air. They contain special enzymes that can break down hydrocarbons and other petroleum products. The origin of the bacteria in these natural asphalt pits is unknown, but it is believed that they evolved from preexisting soil microorganisms that survived an asphalt seepage event thousands of years ago. The soil microorganisms had to adapt and undergo genetic changes to help tolerate the harsh, new environment, which ultimately gave rise to new bacterial species.

In one study, the predominant bacteria found in the La Brea Tar Pits were of the &quot;Gammaproteobacteria&quot; class in the &quot;Chromatiales&quot; order, more simply referred to as purple sulfur bacteria. Purple sulfur bacteria do not use water as their reducing agent, so oxygen is not produced during respiration. Instead, they use sulfur in the form of sulfides as their reducing agent. Other bacteria discovered in the tar pits were of the &quot;Rubrobacteraceae&quot; family. These bacteria are known for being some of the most radiation-resistant organisms on the planet.  

Pitch Lake, another asphalt pit in Trinidad and Tobago, is also a habitat for microbial communities of archaea and bacteria. Bacterial microorganisms from the orders &quot;Burkholderiales&quot; and &quot;Enterobacteriales&quot; have been found living in microliter-sized droplets of water recovered from the lake. The biomass in Pitch Lake lake was reported up to 107 cells per gram of asphalt. Many of these microbes survive on sulfur, iron, methane, or other hydrocarbons. Ongoing research is being conducted in Pitch Lake because it mimics the environment found on the surface of Saturn’s largest moon, Titan. The discovery of extremophiles in Pitch Lake provides insight into the possibilities for microbial life in the hydrocarbon lakes that are found on Titan.

== Contributions to greenhouse gases ==
Tar pits are formed by the fractionation of crude oil at the surface. The lighter hydrocarbons of the crude oil, which include methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), and propane (C3H8), evaporate, leaving behind larger hydrocarbons that make up the chemical composition of asphalt. This is a concern because methane, ethane, and propane are either major greenhouse gases and/or photochemical pollutants. The La Brea Tar Pits emit about 500 kg of methane per day. The emissions are the highest along the 6th Street Fault, which is the conduit that feeds the tar pits with crude oil from the sediments underneath Earth&#x27;s surface. It was also discovered that methane is evaporating out of the nearby soil, affecting the physiology of the native grasses. The La Brea Tar Pits have the highest natural gas flux measured for any onshore seepage zone in the United States. On a global scale, geologic CH4 and C2H6 emissions estimates from gas seepage in sedimentary rock are in the order of 50-70 Tg/year and 2-4 Tg/year respectively. These values are roughly half of the global CH4 and C2H6 emissions from anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion, which are approximately 100-150 Tg CH4/year and 6-8 Tg C2H6/year. These hydrocarbon emissions can be contributed to oil biodegradation and methanogenesis within the tar pits.  

The natural geologic sources of methane and other hydrocarbons should be considered when modeling atmospheric greenhouse gases. Not all sources of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere are a result of anthropogenic emissions.

== Dangers of tar pits ==
Hydrocarbon seepage in urban or industrialized areas present a geologic hazard due to the explosive nature of hydrocarbons. On March 24, 1985, a pocket of methane gas passed through a small opening between the floor slab and foundation walls of a Ross clothing department store in Los Angeles, only about a mile north of the La Brea Tar Pits. This methane pocket created an explosion that injured 21 people. This event increased awareness of the potential dangers of methane pockets and hydrocarbon seepage in the area.

== Key to paleoplant behavior ==
Tar pits are excellent preserving agents, and they also have the ability to provide carbon isotope data for trees that have fallen into the asphalt. Looking at carbon isotope data in prehistoric trees can reveal information about plant responses to different amounts of carbon dioxide in the paleoatmosphere. Samples of &quot;Juniperus&quot; trees from the Last Glacial Period were recovered from the La Brea Tar Pits, and they revealed that the ratio of intercellular and atmospheric CO2 was similar between glacial and modern trees. Since the amount of carbon dioxide during the Last Glacial Period was between 180 and 200 ppm (409.8 ppm today), there was less carbon available for photosynthesis. The &quot;Juniperus&quot; trees had to enhance CO2 uptake to survive under limiting carbon conditions. It is likely that the trees’ stomatal conductance and chloroplast demand for CO2 was higher during this period to increase their carbon consumption. When moving into the following Interglacial Period, the &quot;Juniperus&quot; trees’ stomatal conductance and chloroplast demand for CO2 decreased as a result of higher temperatures and higher CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. This response to fluctuating carbon levels is seen in plants over time. For example, increased stomatal conductance is observed in modern C3 plants grown in low CO2 environments. It is also hypothesized that the wetter climate during the Last Glacial Period may have increased the nitrogen availability to plants, which therefore increased the concentration of nitrogen in leaves. This change may have increased the &quot;Juniperus&quot; trees’ photosynthetic capacities.

== History of tar pits and humans ==
A woman&#x27;s body was recovered from the La Brea Tar Pits in 1914.  Only the skull and parts of the skeleton were preserved, and she was determined to have died about 9,000 years ago.  She was between the ages 18–24 at death, and she was 4 feet and 8-10 inches tall. This is the only reported instance of human remains found within tar pits.

For thousands of years, Native Americans used tar from the La Brea Tar Pits as an adhesive and binding agent. They would use it as waterproof caulking to line their boats and baskets. When Europeans arrived at the tar pits, they began mining and extracting the tar for roofing material in nearby towns.

<doc id="224046" wikidata="Q10489" url="?curid=224046" title="Passau (district)">
<text>Passau is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the southeast of Bavaria, Germany. It encloses the city of Passau geographically from two sides. Neighboring districts are (from the east clockwise) Rottal-Inn, Deggendorf, Freyung-Grafenau. To the south it borders Austria.

==History==
Archaeological findings prove that the area was settled more than 7000 years ago. In 1971 the district was created by merging the previous districts Wegscheid, Vilshofen, Griesbach (Rottal) and parts of the districts Pfarrkirchen and Eggenfelden. The city&#x27;s original name was Batava (also known as Batavia) in Roman times. Passau survived three major fires, the biggest one being the all-destructive fire from 1662. After much of the city had burned down, bishops rebuilt it in Baroque style. To this day, massive cathedrals such as the St. Stephan&#x27;s Dom (Dom means &quot;cathedral&quot; in German) stun visitors from all over the world. St. Stephan houses the world&#x27;s largest church organ.

==Geography==
The district consists of two geographically different parts, separated by the river Danube. In the north is the southern part of the Bayrischer Wald (Bavarian Forest) mountains with hills up to 1000 meters tall. In the south of the Danube river the landscape is only hilly with plains between the valleys of the Inn and Ilz river.

==Coat of arms==
The bottom of the coat of arms show the blue-and-white checkered symbol of Bavaria. In the top part is a red wolf and a red panther. The wolf represents the abbey of Passau (&quot;Hochstift Passau&quot;), which is now the central part of the district. The panther is the symbol of the Wittelsbach family, and it represents the area of the former districts Vilshofen and Griesbach.

<doc id="224049" wikidata="Q1243210" url="?curid=224049" title="Double penetration">
<text>Double penetration (sometimes called DP for short) is a term that usually refers to a vaginal and anal sex act involving one penis penetrating a vagina while another penetrates the anus. It could also refer to the simultaneous penetration of either a vagina or an anus by two penises or objects.

==Practice==
Double penetration usually involves the insertion and thrusting of two erect penises into a woman&#x27;s vagina and anus simultaneously. It is a common practice in pornography. The term can also describe the insertion and thrusting of two erect penises into a single vagina or anus. This is known as double vaginal penetration (DVP) and double anal penetration (DAP) respectively.

Double penetration can be carried out not only with penises, but also with different parts of the body (hands, fingers) or with specific sex toys. 

The sexual act may be pleasurable for the female penetrated partner due to the &quot;blended orgasms&quot; from the stimulation of either or both the G-spot and the A-spot (anterior fornix) in the vagina with the anal nerve endings and the PS-spot (perineal sponge), which is situated inside the wall separating the anal and vaginal canals. The penetrating partners may derive pleasure from the tightness of the vagina and/or anus, as well as from their penises rubbing together either in the same orifice or through the lining of the rectovaginal fascia.

==History==

Representations of double penetration have been depicted in many Roman erotic objects, as well as in the Kama Sutra. The first filmed double penetration in history appeared in 1970, in the movie &quot;Delphia the Greek&quot;, by director Lasse Braun.

The feminist Bernadette Barton has argued that double penetration, because it usually involves two men&#x27;s penises close together or directly touching, is an &quot;unusually homoerotic&quot; act in an otherwise homophobic culture. Barton also thinks double penetration is &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;body punishing&quot; because it can stretch a woman&#x27;s orifices to their physical limit. Pornographic actor James Deen denies that double penetration is inherently &quot;homosexual activity&quot;, even if two penises are in the same orifice, believing that the motivation of the male performer determines whether the act is homosexual or not. Bisexual author Zachary Zane writes that double penetration is not inherently bisexual, but may become bisexual if the men choose to interact sexually, saying that queer men doubly penetrating a woman may be a &quot;completely different experience&quot; than straight men doing so.

== Spit-roast ==
The spit-roast is a variation of double penetration, whereby a person is penetrated in the rear by one penis (either in the vagina or anus) and performs oral sex on another penis. This sexual act combines both the doggy style position with fellatio; the &quot;spit-roast&quot; is frequently depicted within pornography.

<doc id="224061" wikidata="Q532301" url="?curid=224061" title="Minamoto no Yoshitomo">
<text>(1123 – 11 February 1160) was the head of the Minamoto clan and a general of the late Heian period of Japanese history. His son Minamoto no Yoritomo became &quot;shōgun&quot; and founded the Kamakura shogunate, the first shogunate in the history of Japan.

His Dharma name was Shōjō Juin (勝定寿院).

==Hōgen Rebellion==
With the outbreak of the Hōgen Rebellion in 1156, the members of the Minamoto and Taira samurai clans were called into the conflict. Yoshitomo and Taira no Kiyomori both threw their support behind Emperor Go-Shirakawa and Fujiwara no Tadamichi, while Yoshitomo&#x27;s father, Minamoto no Tameyoshi, sided with the retired Emperor Sutoku and Fujiwara no Yorinaga. Yoshitomo, defeating his father and the forces of Sutoku and Yorinaga, became head of the Minamoto clan and established himself as the main political power in the capital of Kyoto. However, despite attempts to have his father pardoned, Tameyoshi was executed. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the Taira and Minamoto became two of the strongest and most influential clans in Japan, which turned the two clans into bitter rivals.

==Heiji Rebellion==
In the first months of 1160 while Taira no Kiyomori was absent from the capital of Kyoto, Yoshitomo and Fujiwara no Nobuyori placed Go-Shirakawa under house arrest and killed his retainers, including the scholar Fujiwara no Michinori, in what is called the Heiji rebellion. The civil war wasn&#x27;t to go on for very long as Kiyomori declared his support for the Emperor and rapidly defeated the rebel forces within the span of a month.

While making his escape from Kyoto, Yoshitomo was forced to sacrifice his son Tomonaga to buy time. Even so, Yoshitomo was eventually betrayed and murdered while taking a bath. Three of his surviving sons, Yoritomo, Yoshitsune and Noriyori, were spared execution and exiled by the victorious Kiyomori. However, Yoshitomo&#x27;s allies Yoshihira and Nobuyori were both executed.

His grave in Aichi Prefecture is surrounded on all sides by wooden swords (&quot;bokuto&quot;), as by legend his last words were &quot;If only I&#x27;d had a bokuto...&quot;.

==Family==
Yoshitomo fathered five sons in total. His two sons, Yoshihira and Tomonaga, lost their lives following the Minamoto Clan&#x27;s defeat in the Heiji Rebellion in 1160. At the time of the outbreak of the Genpei War in 1180, Minamoto no Yoritomo was his eldest surviving son. His other two surviving sons were Minamoto no Noriyori and Minamoto no Yoshitsune.

<text>The Battle of Warsaw (; , ), also known as the Miracle on the Vistula (), was a series of battles that resulted in a decisive Polish victory and complete disintegration of the Red Army in August 1920 during the Polish–Soviet War.

After the Polish Kiev offensive, Soviet forces launched a successful counterattack in summer 1920, forcing the Polish army to retreat westward. The Polish forces seemed on the verge of disintegration and observers predicted a decisive Soviet victory.

The Battle of Warsaw was fought from August 12–25, 1920, as Red Army forces commanded by Mikhail Tukhachevsky approached the Polish capital of Warsaw and the nearby Modlin Fortress. On August 16, Polish forces commanded by Józef Piłsudski counterattacked from the south, disrupting the enemy&#x27;s offensive, forcing the Russian forces into a disorganized withdrawal eastward and behind the Neman River. Estimated Russian losses were 10,000 killed, 500 missing, 30,000 wounded, and 66,000 taken prisoner, compared with Polish losses of some 4,500 killed, 10,000 missing, and 22,000 wounded.

The defeat crippled the Red Army; Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader, called it &quot;an enormous defeat&quot; for his forces. In the following months, several more Polish follow-up victories secured Poland&#x27;s independence and led to a peace treaty with the Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine later that year, securing the Polish state&#x27;s eastern frontiers until 1939.

The politician and diplomat Edgar Vincent regards this event as one of the most important battles in history on his expanded list of most decisive battles, since the Polish victory over the Soviets halted the spread of communism further westwards into Europe. A Soviet victory, which would have led to the creation of a Soviet-established government in Poland, would have put the Soviets directly on the German border, where they were expecting or were promised aligned forces, as well as other such areas.

== Prelude ==
In the aftermath of World War I, Poland fought to preserve its newly regained independence, lost in the 1795 partitions of Poland, and to carve out the borders of a new multinational federation (Intermarium) from the territories of their former partitioners, Russia, Germany, and Austria.

At the same time in 1919, the Bolsheviks had gained the upper hand in the Russian Civil War, having dealt crippling blows to the Russian White Movement. Vladimir Lenin viewed Poland as a bridge to bring communism to Central and Western Europe, and the Polish–Soviet War seemed the perfect way to test the Red Army&#x27;s strength. The Bolshevik&#x27;s speeches asserted that the revolution was to be carried to western Europe on the bayonets of Russian &quot;soldat&quot;s and that the shortest route to Berlin and Paris lay through Warsaw. The conflict began when Polish head of state Józef Piłsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian leader Symon Petlyura (on April 21, 1920) and their combined forces began to push into Ukraine, liberating Kyiv on May 7.

The two sides were embroiled in the Polish–Ukrainian War, amidst competing territorial claims. After early setbacks against Poland in 1919, the Red Army was overwhelmingly successful in a counter-offensive in early 1920 that nullified the Polish Kiev Operation, forcing a Polish retreat. By mid-1920, Poland&#x27;s very survival was at stake and foreign observers expected it to collapse at any moment. The Russian strategy called for a mass push toward the Polish capital, Warsaw. Its capture would have had a major propaganda effect for the Russian Bolsheviks, who expected the fall of the Polish capital not only to undermine the morale of the Poles, but to spark an international series of communist uprisings and clear the way for the Red Army to join the German Revolution.

The Russian 1st Cavalry Army under Semyon Budyonny broke through Polish lines in early June. The effects of that were dramatic; Budyonny&#x27;s success resulted in a collapse of all Polish fronts. On July 4, Mikhail Tukhachevsky&#x27;s Western Front began an all-out assault in Belarus from the Berezina River, forcing Polish forces to retreat. On July 19 the Red Army seized Grodno, on July 22 the Brześć Fortress was captured and on July 28, it reached Białystok. In early August, Polish and Soviet delegations met at Baranavichy and exchanged notes, but their talks came to nothing.

By the beginning of August, the Polish retreat had become more organized, as their supply lines were steadily shortened. At first, Józef Piłsudski wanted to stop the Soviets at the Bug River and the city of Brest-Litovsk, but the Soviet advance resulted in their forces breaching that line, making that plan obsolete. On the night of August 5–6, Piłsudski, staying at the Belweder Palace in Warsaw, conceived a revised plan. In the first phase, it called for Polish forces to withdraw across the Vistula River and defend the bridgeheads at Warsaw and at the Wieprz River, a tributary of the Vistula southeast of Warsaw. A quarter of the available divisions would be concentrated to the south for a strategic counteroffensive. Next, Piłsudski&#x27;s plan called for the 1st and 2nd Armies of General Józef Haller&#x27;s Central Front ( divisions) to take a passive role, facing the Soviet main westward thrust and holding their entrenched positions, Warsaw&#x27;s last line of defence, at all costs. At the same time, the 5th Army ( divisions) under General Władysław Sikorski, subordinate to Haller, would defend the northern area near the Modlin Fortress; when it became feasible they were to strike from behind Warsaw, thus cutting off Soviet forces attempting to envelop Warsaw from that direction, and break through the enemy front and fall upon the rear of the Soviet Northwestern Front. Additionally, five divisions of the 5th Army were to protect Warsaw from the north. General Franciszek Latinik&#x27;s 1st Army would defend Warsaw itself, while General Bolesław Roja&#x27;s 2nd Army was to hold the Vistula River line from Góra Kalwaria to Dęblin.

The crucial role, however, was assigned to the approximately 20,000-strong, newly formed Task Force (also translated as &quot;Strike Group&quot; or &quot;Strike Army&quot;, from Polish ), under the personal command of Piłsudski. This unit, composed of the most elite Polish units from the southern front, was to be reinforced by General Leonard Skierski&#x27;s 4th Army and General Zygmunt Zieliński&#x27;s 3rd Army. After retreating from the Bug River area, those armies had not moved directly toward Warsaw but had crossed the Wieprz River and broken off contact with their pursuers, thus confusing the enemy as to their whereabouts. The Assault Group&#x27;s assignment was to spearhead a rapid offensive from their southern position in the Vistula-Wieprz River triangle. They were supposed to advance north, targeting a weak spot that the Polish intelligence thought to have found in between the Soviet Western and Southwestern Fronts, where their communications relied on the weak Mozyr Group. The aim of this operation was to throw the Soviet Western Front into chaos and separate it from its reserves. According to the plan, Sikorski&#x27;s 5th Army and the advancing Assault Group would meet near the East Prussian border, leaving the Soviets trapped in an encirclement.

Although based on fairly reliable information provided by Polish intelligence and intercepted Soviet radio communications, the plan was called &#x27;amateurish&#x27; by many high-ranking army officers and military experts, from Polish officers to the advisors from the French Military Mission to Poland who were quick to point out Piłsudski&#x27;s lack of formal military education.

Criticism was levied on the logistical side, as suggested concentration points were as far as from many Polish units, most of them engaged on the front lines, and all of that a mere week before the planned date of the counterattack. All regrouping was within striking distance of the enemy; if Piłsudski and his staff mistimed when the Soviet offensive would begin, the Polish counter-attack and even the cohesion of the entire Polish front would be in chaos. Piłsudski himself admitted in his memoirs that it was a gamble; he decided to go forward with it due to politicians&#x27; defeatist stance, fear for the safety of the capital, and the prevailing feeling that if Warsaw were to fall, all would be lost. Only the desperate situation persuaded other army commanders to go along with it. They realized that under the circumstances, it was the only possible way to avoid a devastating defeat. The plan seemed so desperate and inept, that when the Soviets intercepted a copy of it, it was discarded as a poor deception attempt.

The authorship of the plan is a matter of some controversy. Due to Piłsudski&#x27;s political image, he was largely unpopular with the right wing of Polish politics. Furthermore, Paderewski told top Allied leaders that French general Maxime Weygand had the idea; Paderewski knew better, but he was trying to use American support for a comeback in Polish politics. After the battle, many reports suggested that the plan was in fact prepared either by Weygand or by the Polish Chief of Staff Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski. According to recent research, the French Military Mission proposed only a minor tactical counter-attack of two divisions towards Mińsk Mazowiecki. Its aim would have been to push the Red Army 30 kilometres back in order to ease subsequent ceasefire negotiations. On the other hand, General Rozwadowski&#x27;s plan called for a deeper thrust into Russian lines from the area of Wieprz. However, Piłsudski proposed a large-scale operation, with significant forces committed to beating the enemy forces rather than merely pushing them back. The plan was opposed by the French mission, which did not believe that the Polish army would be able to regroup after a 600-kilometre retreat. Nonetheless, for many years, a myth persisted that it was the timely arrival of Allied forces that had saved Poland, a myth in which Weygand occupied the central role.

Davies points out Piłsudski &quot;was left with only one serious possibility—a counter-offensive to the right of centre, at a point where a strike-force could be assembled from both northern and southern fronts. He pondered and checked these considerations during the night of 5–6 August, ruminating alone in his study at Belweder in Warsaw. In the morning, he received Rozwadowski and together they worked out the details. Rozwadowski pointed out the value of the River Wieprz ... by the evening, Order No. 8358/3 ... was ready and issued.&quot; Gen. Weygand admitted in his memoirs that &quot;the victory was Polish, the plan Polish, the army Polish&quot;.

=== Russian ===

Mikhail Tukhachevsky planned to cross the Vistula River northwest of Warsaw, around the city of Włocławek, and then attack from that direction to encircle the capital. With 24 divisions in four armies under his command, he planned to repeat the classic maneuver of Ivan Paskevich, who in 1831, during the November Uprising, had crossed the Vistula at Toruń and reached Warsaw practically unopposed, crushing the Polish uprising. This move would also cut the Polish forces off from Gdańsk, the only port open to shipments of arms and supplies.

The main weakness of the Russian plan was the poorly defended southern flank, secured only by the Pinsk Marshes and the weak Mazyr (Mozyrska) Group. That unit consisted of the 57th Infantry Division, 8,000 strong, and acted as the link between the Soviet two fronts (the majority of the Russian Southwest Front was engaged in the Battle of Lwów).

Davies argues that the Soviet failure was caused by its tardiness in moving forces in for a frontal attack on Warsaw. By contrast the Poles were speedy, making every day&#x27;s delay a liability to the Soviets. Furthermore, there was poor coordination between the Soviet Western Command and the three armies of the Southwestern Command. In the political sphere, Davies argues, there was too much friction inside the Soviet Command. According to the historian Thomas Fiddick in 1973, rumors of disobedience to orders on the Soviet side by General Semyon Budyonny, or possibly even Joseph Stalin, were baseless. Moscow had decided for political reasons to reinforce the Crimean front at the expense of the Polish front. It meant it was replacing its goals of Europe-wide Communist revolution with a sort of &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; with the West amidst internal consolidation. However, more recent historians have stated that Stalin disobeyed orders in early August 1920 when he attempted to conquer Lvov rather than transfer his troops to assist Tukhachevsky&#x27;s forces that were attacking Warsaw. In Moscow, Lenin and Trotsky blamed him for his behaviour in the Polish–Soviet War. Stalin&#x27;s secretary, Boris Bazhanov argued that the offensive against Warsaw failed because Stalin and his army did not comply with the orders of the commander in chief. Tukhachevsky himself blamed Stalin for his defeat at the Battle of Warsaw.

== Battle ==
=== First phase ===

While the Red Army pushed forward, Gayk Bzhishkyan&#x27;s Cavalry Corps, together with the 4th Army, crossed the Wkra River and advanced towards the town of Włocławek, the 15th and 3rd Armies were approaching Modlin Fortress and the 16th Army moved towards Warsaw. The final Russian assault on Warsaw began on August 12. The Soviet 16th Army commenced the attack at the town of Radzymin (only 23 kilometres east of the city) and captured it the following day. This initial success of the Red Army prompted Piłsudski to move up his plans by 24 hours.

The first phase of the battle started on August 12, with a Red Army frontal assault on the Praga bridgehead. In heavy fighting, Radzymin changed hands several times and most foreign diplomats left Warsaw; only the British and Vatican ambassadors chose to remain. On August 14, Radzymin fell to the Red Army, and the lines of Sikorski&#x27;s Polish 5th Army were broken. The 5th Army had to fight three Soviet armies at once: the 3rd, 4th, and 15th. The Modlin sector was reinforced with reserves (the Siberian Brigade and General Franciszek Krajowski&#x27;s fresh 18th Infantry Division, both elite, battle-tested units: the 5th Army held out until dawn.

The situation was saved around midnight when the 203rd Uhlan Regiment managed to break through the Red Army lines and attack a Soviet command post, which resulted in a destruction of a radio station of A. D. Shuvayev&#x27;s Soviet 4th Army. The latter unit had only one radio station left, fixed on one frequency which was known to the Polish intelligence. Since the Polish code-breakers did not want the Russians to find out that their codes had been broken, the remaining Soviet radio station was neutralized by having the radio station in Warsaw recite the Book of Genesis in Polish and Latin on the frequency used by the 4th Army. It thus lost contact with its headquarters and continued marching toward Toruń and Płock, unaware of Tukhachevsky&#x27;s order to turn south. The raid by the 203rd Uhlans is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Miracle of Ciechanów&quot;.

At the same time, the Polish 1st Army under Latinik resisted a direct Red Army assault on Warsaw by six rifle divisions. The struggle for control of Radzymin forced Józef Haller, commander of the Polish Northern Front, to start the 5th Army&#x27;s counterattack earlier than planned.

During this time, Piłsudski was finishing his plans for the counter-offensive. He decided to supervise the attack, personally handing in a letter of resignation from all state functions so he could concentrate on the military situation and so that if he died, it would not paralyze the state. He succeeded in raising the morale of the troops, between August 12 and August 15, visiting units of the 4th Army concentrating near Puławy, about 100 kilometres south of Warsaw.

At that time, Piłsudski also commented on the dreadful state of logistics of the Polish army: &quot;In the 21st Division, almost half of the soldiers paraded in front of me barefoot.&quot; The newly created Polish army had little choice in its equipment; its rifles and artillery pieces were produced in at least six countries, each of them using different ammunition.

=== Second phase ===
The 27th Infantry Division of the Red Army managed to reach the village of Izabelin, 13 kilometres northwest of the capital, but this was the closest that Russian forces would come.
Tukhachevsky, certain that all was going according to plan, was actually falling into Piłsudski&#x27;s trap. There were only token Polish resistance in the path of the main Russian advance north and across the Vistula, on the right flank of the battle (from the perspective of the Soviet advance). At the same time, south of Warsaw, on the battle&#x27;s left front, the vital link between the Northwestern and Southwestern Fronts was much more vulnerable, protected only by a small Soviet force, the Mozyr Group. Further, Budyonny, commanding the 1st Cavalry Army, a unit much feared by Piłsudski and other Polish commanders, disobeyed orders by the Soviet High Command, which at Tukhachevsky&#x27;s insistence, ordered him to advance at Warsaw from the south. Budyonny resented this order, influenced by a grudge between commanding South-Western Front generals Alexander Ilyich Yegorov and Tukhachevsky. In addition, the political games of Stalin, at the time the chief political commissar of the South-Western Front, further contributed to Yegorov&#x27;s and Budyonny&#x27;s disobedience. Stalin, looking for personal glory, aimed to capture the besieged Lwów (Lviv), an important industrial center. Ultimately, Budyonny&#x27;s forces marched on Lwów instead of Warsaw, and thus missed the battle.

The Polish 5th Army counterattacked on August 14, crossing the Wkra River. It faced the combined forces of the Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies (both numerically and technically superior). The struggle at Nasielsk lasted until August 15 and resulted in near-complete destruction of the town. However, the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and Modlin was halted at the end of August 15, and on that day Polish forces recaptured Radzymin, which boosted the Polish morale.

From that moment on, Sikorski&#x27;s 5th Army pushed exhausted Soviet units away from Warsaw, in an almost Blitzkrieg-like operation. Sikorski&#x27;s units were given the support of almost all of the small number of mechanized units—tanks and armoured cars—that the Polish army had, as well as that of the two Polish armoured trains. It was able to advance rapidly at the speed of 30 kilometres a day, disrupting the Soviet &quot;enveloping&quot; northern manoeuvre.

=== Third phase ===
On August 16, the Polish Assault Group commanded by Piłsudski began its march north from the Wieprz River. It faced the Mazyr Group, a Soviet corps that had defeated the Poles during the Kiev operation several months earlier. However, during its pursuit of the retreating Polish armies, the Mazyr Group had lost most of its troops and had been reduced to only one or two divisions covering a 150-kilometre front line on the left flank of the Soviet 16th Army. On the first day of the counteroffensive, only one of the five Polish divisions reported any sort of opposition, while the remaining four, supported by a cavalry brigade, managed to advance north 45 kilometres unopposed. When evening fell, the town of Włodawa had been liberated, and the communication and supply lines of the Soviet 16th Army had been cut. Even Piłsudski was surprised by the extent of these early successes. The Assault Group units covered about 70 kilometres in 36 hours. As planned, it split the Soviet fronts, disrupting the offensive, all without encountering any significant resistance. The Mazyr Group had already been defeated on the first day of the Polish counterattack. Consequently, the Polish armies found what they had hoped for—a large opening between the Soviet fronts. They exploited it ruthlessly, continuing their northward offensive with two armies following and falling on the surprised and confused enemy.

On August 18, Tukhachevsky, in his headquarters in Minsk, some east of Warsaw, realized the extent of his defeat, quickly issuing the orders for the Red Army to retreat and regroup. He wanted to straighten the front line to improve his logistics, regain the initiative and push the Poles back again, but the situation had progressed beyond salvaging. His orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all. Soviet General Bzhishkyan&#x27;s 3rd Cavalry Corps continued to advance toward Pomerania, its lines endangered by the Polish 5th Army, which had finally managed to push back the Red Army and switched over to pursuit. The Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division, in order to cut the enemy&#x27;s retreat, carried out a forced march, going on the move for up to 21 hours a day, from Lubartów to Białystok—covering in only six days. Throughout that period, the division engaged the enemy twice. The division&#x27;s rapid advance allowed it to intercept the 16th Soviet Army, cutting it off from reinforcements near Białystok and forcing most of its troops to surrender.

The Soviet armies in the centre of the front fell into chaos. Some divisions continued to fight their way toward Warsaw, while others retreated, lost their cohesion and panicked. Tukhachevsky lost contact with most of his forces, and the Soviet plans were thrown into disorder. Only the 15th Army remained an organized force; it tried to obey Tukhachevsky&#x27;s orders, shielding the withdrawal of the westernmost extended 4th Army. However, it was defeated twice on August 19 and 20 and joined the general rout of the Red Army&#x27;s North-Western Front. Tukhachevsky had no choice but to order a full retreat toward the Western Bug River. By August 21, all organized resistance ceased to exist, and by August 31, the Soviet Southwestern Front was completely routed.

== Aftermath ==
Although Poland managed to achieve victory and push back the Russians, Piłsudski&#x27;s plan to outmanoeuvre and surround the Red Army did not succeed completely. On July 4, four Soviet armies of the North-Western Front began to advance on Warsaw. After initial successes, by the end of August, three of them—the 4th, 15th and 16th Armies, as well as the bulk of Bzhishkyan&#x27;s 3rd Cavalry Corps—had all but disintegrated, their remnants either taken prisoner or briefly interned after crossing the border into German East Prussia. The 3rd Army was the least affected; due to the speed of its retreat, the pursuing Polish troops could not catch up with it.

Red Army losses were about 15,000 dead, 500 missing, 10,000 wounded and 65,000 captured, compared to Polish losses of approximately 4,500 killed, 22,000 wounded and 10,000 missing. Between 25,000 and 30,000 Soviet troops managed to reach the borders of Germany. After crossing into East Prussian territory, they were briefly interned, then allowed to leave with their arms and equipment. Poland captured about 231 pieces of artillery and 1,023 machine guns.

The southern arm of the Red Army&#x27;s forces had been routed and no longer posed a threat to the Poles. Semyon Budyonny&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Army, besieging Lwów, had been defeated at the Battle of Komarów on August 31 and the Battle of Hrubieszów. By mid-October, the Polish army had reached the Tarnopol–Dubno–Minsk–Drysa line.

Tukhachevsky succeeded eventually in reorganizing his eastward-retreating forces, but not in regaining the initiative. In September, he established a new defensive line near Grodno. In order to break it, the Polish army fought the Battle of the Niemen River (September 15–21), once again defeating the Red Army. After the Battle of the Szczara River, both sides were exhausted. On October 12, under heavy pressure from France and Britain, a ceasefire was signed. By October 18, the fighting was over, and on March 18, 1921, the Treaty of Riga was signed, ending hostilities.

Bolshevik propaganda before the Battle of Warsaw had described the fall of Poland&#x27;s capital as imminent, and its anticipated fall was to be a signal for the start of large-scale communist revolutions in Poland, Germany, and other European countries, economically devastated by the First World War. Due to the Polish victory, however, the Soviet attempts to overthrow the government of Lithuania (planned for August) had to be cancelled. The Soviet defeat was therefore considered a setback for Soviet leaders supportive of that plan (particularly Vladimir Lenin).

A National Democrat Sejm deputy, Stanisław Stroński, coined the phrase, &quot;Miracle on the Vistula&quot; (Polish: ), to underline his disapproval of Piłsudski&#x27;s earlier &quot;Ukrainian adventure&quot;. In response, Poland&#x27;s Prime Minister Wincenty Witos commented, &quot;Whatever you want to write and say – whoever you want to dress in laurels and merits – this &quot;is&quot; 1920&#x27;s &#x27;Miracle on the Vistula&#x27;.&quot; Diaries from many participants of the battle attribute the outcome to the Blessed Virgin Mary (citing multiple reasons, including widespread national prayer beforehand and subsequent reports of her appearance on the battlefield). The date of the turn of the battle, August 15, is the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary which is an important date in the Catholic year.

=== Breaking of Russian ciphers ===
According to documents found in 2005 at Poland&#x27;s Central Military Archives, Polish cryptanalysts broke Russian ciphers they had intercepted as early as September 1919. At least some of the Polish victories, not only the Battle of Warsaw but also other battles, can be attributed to this. Lieutenant Jan Kowalewski, credited with the original breakthrough, received the Order of Virtuti Militari in 1921.

<doc id="224070" wikidata="Q219561" url="?curid=224070" title="Missionary position">
<text>The missionary position or man-on-top position is a sex position in which, generally, a woman lies on her back and spreads her legs and a man lies on top of her while they face each other and engage in vaginal intercourse. The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. It may involve sexual penetration or non-penetrative sex (for example, intercrural sex), and its penile-vaginal aspect is an example of ventro-ventral (front-to-front) reproductive activity. Variations of the position allow varying degrees of clitoral stimulation, depth of penetration, participation on the part of the woman, and the likelihood and speed of orgasm.

The missionary position is the most common sex position, but it is not universally regarded as the most favoured one. The missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other&#x27;s eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting; it is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs. The position is not suitable for late stages of pregnancy, and is less desired when the woman wants to have greater control over the rhythm and depth of penetration during intercourse.

==Etymology and other usage==
A common story and belief is that the term &#x27;missionary position&#x27; arose in connection with English-speaking Christian missionaries, who supposedly encouraged the sexual position in new converts in the colonial era. However, the term probably originated from Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; (1948) through a confluence of misunderstandings and misinterpretations of historical documents.

The French refer to it as the &#x27;classical&#x27; position. Tuscans refer to the position as &#x27;the Angelic position&#x27;, while some Arabic-speaking groups call it &#x27;the manner of serpents.&#x27; Before the release of Kinsey&#x27;s work, the missionary position was known by several names, including &#x27;the matrimonial&#x27;, &#x27;the Mama-Papa position&#x27;, &#x27;the English-American position&#x27;, and &#x27;the male superior position&#x27;. In 1948, Kinsey published the male volume of the Kinsey Reports, &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot;. He described the American preference for the position and called it &quot;the English-American position&quot;. Discussing Malinowski&#x27;s &quot;The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia&quot;, Kinsey wrote, &quot;It will be recalled that Malinowski (1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different position among the Trobrianders ... [and] ... that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around ... campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the &#x27;missionary position.&#x27;&quot; , lexicographers and sexologists have not found use of the term &#x27;missionary position&#x27; before Kinsey.

In 2001, Robert Priest examined the origins of the term and concluded that Kinsey had confused several factors in accidentally coining the term. First, according to Malinowski, Trobrianders played and sang mocking songs under the full moon, and not around a campfire. In &quot;Sexual Behaviors&quot;, Kinsey wrote that the Trobrianders mocked face-to-face man-on-top woman-below intercourse, but does not give context. He mentioned that the position was learned from &quot;white traders, planters, or officials&quot;, but does not discuss missionaries. Kinsey also recalled that the medieval Catholic Church taught the position, and upon seeing the natives mocking it, assumed that missionaries had taught it to them. Finally, Malinowski wrote that he saw an engaged Trobriand couple holding hands and leaning against each other, which the natives described as  — the &#x27;missionary fashion&#x27;. Upon accidentally combining these similar facts, Kinsey invented a new phrase despite believing that he was reporting an old one.

From then on, the story of the name&#x27;s origin may have been retold until it became largely accepted, with its connection to Kinsey and Malinowski having faded. Writers began using the expression for sexual intercourse in the late 1960s, and as Alex Comfort&#x27;s bestseller &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; (1972) and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (1976) spread the term &#x27;missionary position&#x27;, it gradually replaced older names. By the 1990s, it had spread to other languages: (German), (Spanish), (Dutch) and (French).

==Variations==
Though there are a number of variations and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.

===Basic position===
In the missionary position, a woman lies on her back on a bed or other surface with her legs comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The penetrating partner positions himself between the woman&#x27;s spread legs, and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman&#x27;s vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve fingering her vulva or clitoris in particular, the man will introduce his erect penis in her vagina for penetration, and may use fingers to open the woman&#x27;s labia and guide the penis in.

With the penis inside the woman&#x27;s vagina, the man can control the force, depth, and rhythm of thrusts, and can also control to some extent the female partner&#x27;s movements. Subject to the man&#x27;s weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against the mattress and by side movements in her pelvis as well as by clutching onto and moving with her partner. A woman can increase the force of a man&#x27;s thrust by moving against the man&#x27;s rhythm.

The man may straddle the woman, taking the woman&#x27;s legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman&#x27;s movements, and the man can increase the tightness on the penis by pressing the woman&#x27;s thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.

During sexual intercourse, most women experience involuntary vaginal contractions. The contraction causes the pelvic muscles to tighten around the penis, which increases the level of her partner&#x27;s arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm, which in turn further increases the woman&#x27;s vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, but this is not always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a woman on top position.

During sexual intercourse in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential contact with the anterior wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis reaches the anterior fornix, while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior fornix.

===Position of legs===

A receiving woman&#x27;s legs and arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner&#x27;s weight and in some other way. A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman&#x27;s legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman&#x27;s pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.

A woman&#x27;s legs can remain flat or raised toward her chest, or wrapped around the penetrating partner at various heights: at the back of the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the &quot;Wiener Auster&quot; or Viennese oyster. In the higher leg positions the woman&#x27;s legs may need some support, which may be achieved by crossing the ankles behind the partner or resting on his shoulders. She may also hold them with her hands or cross her arms around them at the knees. Some are flexible enough to cross the legs behind their heads. Alternatively, her partner may hold her legs up.

A pillow or sex pillow can be used, to alter the depth and angle of penetration. A wedge- or ramp-shaped pillow can relieve pressure on the top person&#x27;s hands and arms. Placing a pillow under the woman&#x27;s buttocks can lift her pelvis—a &quot;Playboy&quot; article suggested placing it under her hips to increase pressure on the clitoris. Each of these methods can increase the depth of penetration. Using a pillow can also help the woman arch her back.

In one variant, the woman may lift and slightly bend her legs, resting her feet flat on the bed. This shortens the distance between the vagina and cervix, and may apply more friction to the area termed the &quot;G-Spot.&quot; The woman may find this variant more comfortable, and it can allow her to push against the man&#x27;s thrust, giving her some control over the rhythm.

Placing the woman&#x27;s legs on or over the man&#x27;s shoulders provides the deepest possible penetration. This variant is sometimes called &quot;the anvil&quot;. This position aims the head of the penis at the vaginal fornix (posterior fornix). When the legs are held mid-level in this way, the penis can achieve significant depth while attempting to stimulate the G-Spot and achieving more friction on the top of its shaft.

===Viennese oyster position===
The Viennese oyster position requires the female to lie on her back and position her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. In some cases, the male partner can help hold the female&#x27;s legs in position and continue on with intercourse.

===Butterfly position===

In the &quot;butterfly position&quot;, the woman can lie on her back with her hips on the edge of a platform such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc. while the man penetrates her while standing.

===Riding high===

In the riding high missionary variant, the man enters the woman and then shifts his body up and forward toward her head. He then rocks back and forth, stimulating her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man&#x27;s deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.

===Anal sex, tribadism and other aspects===
Penetrative anal sex may be performed on a partner in the missionary position. The legs may be raised high, with the knees drawn towards their chest, and with some sort of support (such as a pillow) under the receiver&#x27;s hips for comfort and to raise the receiver&#x27;s buttocks. The penetrating partner positions himself between the receiver&#x27;s legs and aligns his penis with the anus for anal penetration. Instead of penetration, an active partner may perform anilingus on the partner with raised legs.

Tribadism between women may be performed in the missionary position. The practice involves women rubbing their vulvas against each other. Female couples may also engage in the missionary position while one or both partners use their fingers or sex toys for stimulation of the clitoris, other parts of the vulva, or vagina.

==Perceived advantages and disadvantages==

===Psychological===
There are many appealing psychological aspects of the missionary position. It is often regarded as a romantic position because the two partners face each other and may maintain eye contact; there is potentially a greater amount of skin-to-skin contact than in any other position; and the couple can hold each other in their arms, which can easily segue into cuddling when sex is over. Partners may engage in other intimate contact, such as kissing, or guiding each other&#x27;s hips with their hands.

At the same time, the woman needs a high level of trust in the man on top who is in a dominant position vis-a-vis the woman below. The trust is demonstrated by the woman spreading her legs in an implicit invitation for the man on top to enter the most sexually sensitive part of her body. This, as well as her lack of control, the social expectation of passivity of the woman and the possibility of pregnancy, heightens her feeling of vulnerability. Her lack of control is accentuated because once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation. With the man&#x27;s weight on the woman, especially on her pelvis, the man has control of the rhythm and depth of his thrusts, as well as the duration and intensity of the sexual activity, which may continue after the woman has orgasmed.

===Physical===
The missionary position is commonly used the first time a couple has sex. Thomas Stuttaford notes that it may be more comfortable to do so: &quot;The discomfort of early penetrative sex, if there is any, is usually related to tension in the pelvic or thigh muscles and/or anxiety that has prevented the usual vaginal lubrication. Muscles of the pelvic floor are more relaxed if, initially, the missionary position is chosen and a couple of pillows are arranged under the woman&#x27;s bottom so her hips are tilted upwards.&quot; &quot;The Lovers&#x27; Guide&quot; states that missionary lends itself well to sex with a new partner as it is &quot;a romantic yet fairly unadventurous sex position&quot; that is &quot;non-threatening and loving&quot; and &quot;lays neither partner open to strangeness, anxiety and unfamiliarity.&quot;

On the other hand, Sacha Tarkovsky advises women to not use the missionary position when having sex for the first time, stating, &quot;You are not in control, and it will be more painful and you cannot do anything but lay there and take it.&quot; Tarkovsky recommends positions such as woman on top that allow the woman to control the speed and pressure at which she loses her hymen. However, it may not be necessary to completely forgo missionary the first time; Alphonso Sirtle suggests starting with woman on top until the hymen is torn, and then possibly switching to missionary or whatever other position is preferred.

The missionary position allows easy entry into the vagina. The man can use force and gravity to help himself in, and the position allows the woman to relax her vaginal muscles and help her partner guide his penis gently in with her hand. Suzi Godson said, &quot;In an observational study carried out in The Netherlands, magnetic resonance imaging was used to study the male and female genitals during coitus. The images illustrate the very natural fit of the male and female genitals in [the missionary] position. The penis has the shape of a boomerang—one third of its length consists of the root of the penis—and the vaginal walls wrap snugly around it.&quot;

According to Sexual Health Resource, &quot;The man-on-top sex positions are very good for couples who are trying to have a baby, because penetration can be very deep. If the woman holds on to her legs behind her knees and draws her thighs right back, sperm can be deposited deep in the vagina—at the neck of the womb. This provided the best chance of conception occurring.&quot; Francoeur states that &quot;male-above sex promotes fertility by keeping the opening of the vagina higher than the seminal pool, which, in turn, helps sperm get into the womb and find the egg.&quot; However, according to BabyCenter, &quot;There is no evidence that any particular sexual position is more likely to lead to conception.&quot; Donnica Moore agrees, stating that while there are no scientific studies regarding the best sexual positions for reproduction, the missionary (man on top) position is typically considered optimal for conception.

Pregnancy Info states that the missionary position may become increasingly awkward for pregnant women as their belly begins to grow. The &quot;March of Dimes&quot; notes, &quot;Positions that work before pregnancy and early in pregnancy can be uncomfortable or even unsafe at later stages of the baby&#x27;s development. For example, a woman should avoid lying flat on her back after the fourth month of pregnancy, because the weight of the growing uterus puts pressure on major blood vessels.&quot; David Port states, &quot;Beginning early in the second trimester, doctors tend to discourage pregnant women from supine exercise. And the missionary position is exactly that kind of exercise, at least if the activity lasts more than a few fleeting moments.&quot;

The deep penetration and large hip thrusts of the missionary position can cause the man to reach orgasm quickly compared to other positions, which can be problematic if the couple seeks to reach simultaneous orgasm. The male reaching orgasm first can be disruptive to sex, as 50% of penile erection is lost immediately after ejaculation, making him more likely to inadvertently slip out of the vagina, especially during the strong pelvic contractions of female orgasm. In addition to the standard methods for treating premature ejaculation, Zachary Veilleux notes that this problem can be overcome by workarounds such as changing positions frequently (which studies have shown delays male orgasm by a factor of two-three), using lubrication to reduce friction (friction stimulates the male but is not as important in female orgasm), or switching to cunnilingus for a while when close to ejaculation, and then switching back when ejaculation is no longer imminent.

The missionary position is sometimes mocked as a plain vanilla sex position. Archer stated, &quot;To all the sex gymnasts, this kind of banal preference looks lazy, unimaginative and uninformed,&quot; but she rebuts this by pointing out the existence of variations: &quot;Missionary is kind of like tofu: You have to add your own flavor.&quot; Perhaps due to the ubiquity of this position, its typical role as the first position used by couples, its tendency to put the man in control of speed, tempo and depth, its ability to cause him to quickly reach orgasm, and the fact that it is literally a &quot;male-superior&quot; position with the man on top, missionary is sometimes associated with men who are dominating and uncreative and selfish about sex. According to Gina Ogden, &quot;the cultural missionary position—man on top&quot; is not conducive to romance since &quot;If a relationship is based on authoritarian control, keeping one person on top and the other underneath, it gets old pretty fast—for both partners, really&quot;. In &quot;Women Who Love Sex&quot;, Ogden writes, &quot;Think what will happen to the missionary position when women, en masse, opt for pleasures that stir body and soul instead of continuing to do good-girl intercourse by the book.&quot; In Chinua Achebe&#x27;s &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, the main character ridicules the idea of women making decisions by saying that one might as well say that the woman lies on top of the man when they are making the baby.

The missionary position has potential for clitoral stimulation in several ways. Christakos assures, &quot;This position can give the woman plenty of clitoral stimulation if the man leans forward thus rubbing his pelvic bone against her clitoris.&quot; Emily Queenie Chung notes, &quot;Also, this position is the easiest for a woman to stimulate her clitoris manually.&quot; Sexual Health Resource notes that also &quot;the man can reach under and stimulate his partner using his fingers on her clitoris&quot; although &quot;the man has limited use of his hands&quot; (presumably this would depend on the variant of the position used and whether the man&#x27;s hands are occupied holding himself up).

Since in women the movements of the penis in and out do not stimulate the clitoral glans continuously, women have discovered the &quot;rocking&quot; movement technique. A study of over 3000 American women found that 76% of women use the technique because they find it sexually arousing, while the penis is in their vagina and barely moving, to rub their clitoris against the base of the penis. Rocking is among the techniques that allow a man to mitigate the rise of his arousal, because the penis receives little friction. Unless he suffers from premature ejaculation, he can thus prevent the orgasm in himself while promoting arousal in the woman. This technique is known as the coital alignment technique.

Sexual activity in the missionary position, as a form of physical exercise, may be slightly more vigorous for the man than in other positions. A study conducted by Bohlen et al. found that &quot;man-on-top coitus required more metabolic expenditure than woman-on-top coitus&quot; and that the heart rate during man-on-top sex was higher than in self-stimulation, partner stimulation, or woman-on-top. In contrast, one study showed that there was no difference in heart rate or blood pressure when comparing these two basic positions, while another showed only a minor decrease in oxygen consumption or exertion with a man-on-bottom position during orgasm.

==History==

The position has been used at least for millennia if not longer since it is also used by the great apes, as well as other primates. Robert Francoeur notes that evidence of the missionary position&#x27;s use appears in ancient pottery and art in the Fertile Crescent as well as in the art of Early Greeks, Romans, Peruvians, Indians, Chinese and Japanese. The majority of the positions described in the Kama Sutra involve the woman lying on her back with her legs in a variety of positions. According to Canongate, ancient art shows missionary as being less popular than woman-on-top positions in Ur, Greece, Rome, Peru, India, China and Japan, but Francoeur states that the ancient Chinese preferred male-on-top because of their belief that males are born face down and females face up. Kagaba natives in Colombia preferred missionary because of the stability it offers; they believed that if the woman moved during intercourse, the earth would slip off the shoulders of the four giants who held it up above the waters. Some Kerala tribes believe that the male-on-top position is the only way to conceive warriors.

In ancient Greece, the missionary position was originally an unpopular position. Beds existed, yet not as we know them today, and men married girls 14 or 15 years of age, which created a height differential. These factors made the rear-entry standing position more convenient. However, circa the second century, Artemidorus popularized the missionary position among Greco-Roman Stoics, declaring it &quot;the only proper and natural&quot; position due to the flow of semen.

Although the Bible does not mention sexual positions, from the 6th to 16th centuries, some Church authorities taught that intercourse should be face-to-face, man-on-top, primarily because they believed that semen flows with gravity, leading to conception. Exceptions were made for couples dealing with illness, obesity, or pregnancy. According to John Bancroft&#x27;s &quot;Human Sexuality and Its Problems&quot;, Thomas Aquinas believed that crimes against nature included intercourse in &quot;unnatural&quot; ways. Protestants did not communicate proper sex positions, and the Catholic Church eventually abandoned its discourse on the topic. Simon Hardy wrote that the missionary position was used to distinguish &quot;bestial and civilized sex.&quot;

Others who held that missionary was the only permitted position included Alexander of Hales and the author of &quot;De secretis mulierum&quot;, who suggested that nonstandard positions might result in birth defects. Ruth Mazo Karras states that William Peraldus&#x27; treatise &quot;Summa de virtutibus et vitiis&quot; distinguished between sins against nature that were &quot;according to the substance&quot; (intercourse other than vaginal) and &quot;according to the manner, as when a woman mounts.&quot; Nicolas Venette&#x27;s 1680s-era sex manual praised the missionary position as the &quot;common posture...which is most allowable and most voluptuous.&quot; Numerous sources have reported that in the United States, some states had outlawed positions other than missionary between husband and wife, or will grant a divorce to a woman whose husband makes love to her in another position. While many states formerly outlawed oral sex, anal sex, buggery, or other &quot;unnatural&quot; acts, no US law has banned dorso-ventral heterosexual sex, or specified which partner needed to be on top.

D&#x27;Emilio and Freedman, who are historians of sexuality, note that historical use of the missionary position in the US is marked by social class as well as ethnicity. In the 19th century, white settlers and Protestant missionaries who moved West attempted to assimilate Native American, Mexican, and immigrant peoples into the sexual values held by the middle classes in the American north. These authors also note that the Kinsey studies revealed social class influences, with working class men preferring to use the missionary position over other sexual positions.

==Popularity==
Among humans, the missionary position is the most commonly used sex position. In his seminal study &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; (1953), which focused on American women, researcher Alfred Kinsey stated that 91% of married women surveyed reported using this position most often, whereas 9% reported using it exclusively. A &quot;The Journal of Sexual Medicine&quot; study entitled &quot;What Kind of Erotic Film Clips Should We Use in Female Sex Research? An Exploratory Study&quot; selected 18 film clips out of a sample of 90 that were found by the women studied to be particularly mentally appealing and visually arousing. 21% of the original 90 involved the missionary position, but 33% of the final 18 involved missionary. Fewer than 10% of sexually active persons rarely or never use the missionary position. According to Francoeur, the Brazilian Bororo Indians eschew missionary, finding it insulting for either partner to be above the other during sex. Balinese shun the man-on-top position in favor of what they call &quot;the Oceanic position&quot; due to their perception of the former as being impractical and clumsy. The Cashinahua people use the missionary position to stay stable when they have sex in a forest stream to avoid insect bites. The inhabitants of Inis Beag practice the missionary position exclusively, with very limited foreplay. In addition to humans, the missionary position has also been used by certain other species, including bonobos, gorillas, and armadillos.

<text>Woman on top is any sex position in which the woman is on top of her sexual partner during sexual activity. The position most commonly associated with the woman on top is often called the cowgirl or riding position, which derives its name from the image of the woman &quot;riding&quot; the man as a cowgirl rides a bucking horse. In that position, a man typically lies on his back with his legs closed, while the female partner straddles him, usually in a kneeling position facing either forward or back, and either the man or woman inserts the man&#x27;s erect penis into the woman&#x27;s vagina or anus. 

The cowgirl position is commonly cited as one of the more popular sex positions, especially by women, because it gives them control over the rhythm and pace of vaginal stimulation and the extent and duration of penetration and because of its ability to adequately stimulate the clitoris. There are other positions in which the woman may be on top, including the 69 position and the pompoir sex position.

In any of the woman on top positions, the woman is usually the active partner during sexual activity, and in addition to satisfying herself can stimulate or massage the man&#x27;s scrotum, especially if his legs are spread. The woman may take the position in the course of sexual activity, especially if the man has attained orgasm while she has not; and in this position she or her partner may perform fingering for her to achieve orgasm.

==Variations==
Initially, the man typically lies on his back with his legs together, while the female partner straddles him in a kneeling position. With the woman&#x27;s legs open, either the man or woman would insert the man&#x27;s erect penis into the woman&#x27;s vagina. Once the woman has attained sufficient vaginal lubrication, she feels comfortable in thrusting up and down the penis and is in a position to vary her position for variety and enhanced pleasure. She can, for example, tilt her body forward toward a full lying position or backwards, or rock sideways. The woman has control over the rhythm and speed of her thrusting. She can also spread the man&#x27;s legs and position herself between them. In this position, she can tighten her legs at will, to increase the pressure on the man&#x27;s penis and on her crotch, and the man can also tighten his legs to increase the pressure. In this position, the man&#x27;s legs are free to raise, as high as the Amazon position, with his legs rolled up towards her chest, but this also should be done with care. These changes can alter the depth and angle of penetration.

The woman can sit backwards on the man and alter her position similarly.

The woman may also be on top in a precursor to the lateral coital position. In this position, the woman will usually prefer to kneel, as a squat will usually place a significantly greater stress on her legs.

===Cowgirl position===
In the cowgirl position, the man lies on his back or sits, with the woman straddling him across his pelvis facing forward, either in a kneeling or squatting position. The woman will align her vagina with the man&#x27;s erect penis, and lower herself onto the penis with either the man or the woman guiding the penis into the woman&#x27;s vagina for penetration. With the erect penis inside the woman, the woman can glide up and down the man&#x27;s penis, controlling the rhythm and pace of vaginal stimulation and the extent and duration of penetration. The woman is free to change her position; possibilities range from leaning back to stretching out on her partner&#x27;s chest to rocking from side to side or in a circular motion. Each of those changes would alter the angle and depth of penetration and which part of the vaginal area and sex organs are stimulated. The man&#x27;s hands are free to reach and touch the woman&#x27;s breasts, clitoris, buttocks, face etc., and the partners can maintain eye contact. With the woman in the sitting or leaning back positions, the man may also stimulate her nipples and clitoris with his fingers, or suck on her nipples if she inclines towards him or he raises his torso towards her.

In this position, a woman can continue with the up and down motion after the man has achieved orgasm until she reaches orgasm. Afterwards, she may collapse onto the man&#x27;s chest, with her vagina being very sensitive to further stimulation. On the other hand, if the woman reaches orgasm before the man, the woman may raise her pelvis to enable the man to actively thrust upwards or the couple may change to a position which enables the man to continue thrusting, such as the missionary position.

===Reverse missionary position===

When the woman lies on her partner&#x27;s chest, this is also called the reverse missionary position. Stretching out with her legs on the man puts more pressure on the woman&#x27;s mons pubis and clitoris. If the man separates his legs, the woman can put her legs between his. In this position, she can increase the tightness on the man&#x27;s penis by pressing her thighs together, or the man may press the woman&#x27;s thighs together. This increases vaginal friction, but she can still control the pace and rhythm of her thrusts. As most women approach orgasm, they experience acute vaginal contractions, which also increases the man&#x27;s sexual stimulation by increasing tightness on his penis.
===Reverse cowgirl position===

In the reverse cowgirl position, the woman straddles the man facing the man&#x27;s feet in a kneeling or squatting position. After either she or the man has guided the penis into the woman&#x27;s vagina, the woman can keep her torso upright, or she can lean forward or back to lie on the man&#x27;s chest or move sideways at will. The man&#x27;s legs can be flat on the bed or arched. The woman also has control over the pace, rhythm, depth, and duration of penetration. By changing her position and thrusts, the woman can change the level of stimulation for the man, while simultaneously stimulating her clitoris or an area termed &quot;the G-spot&quot;.

==Advantage==
An advantage of the woman-on-top positions is that the man&#x27;s weight is not on the woman. These positions are ideal during pregnancy as there is no pressure on the woman&#x27;s abdomen, and it is easy for her to control the depth and speed of penetration. They are also useful if the man is recovering from a serious illness or surgery or if the woman has recently given birth.

Sex with the woman on top has been known in most cultures in all times, and has been depicted in art: 
==Sitting on lap==

Among adults, a female sitting on the lap of another person usually indicates an intimate or romantic relationship between the two, or may be regarded as flirtatious. In public, such behaviour may be regarded as a public display of affection. In private, sitting on a man&#x27;s lap or being pulled by the man onto his lap, especially if she straddles his legs or waist, when accompanied with a smile, kiss or other flirtatious gesture, may be regarded as showing either&#x27;s interest in sexual activity or as foreplay. It is rare for a man to sit on a woman&#x27;s lap, though not for him to lay his head there.

The erotic significance in sitting on a lap is a factor in the erotic activity in strip clubs such as a lap dance, where one person (usually a woman) straddles the lap of the other and gyrates their lower extremities in a provocative manner.

<text>Doggy style is a sex position in which one participant bends over, crouches on all fours (usually on hands and knees), or lies on their abdomen, for sexual intercourse, other forms of sexual penetration or other sexual activity. Doggy style is a form of rear-entry position, others being the spoons sex position in which the receiving partner lies on their side or the reverse cowgirl sex position. Non-penetrative sex in this position may also be regarded as doggy style.

Between sex partners, the person in the doggy style position is usually passive, while the other partner is active (although sometimes it can be the other way around if the person in doggy position backs up into their partner behind them). Either partner may be the dominant partner or the submissive partner.

==History and etymology==

In ancient Rome, this practice was known as coitus more ferarum, Latin for &quot;sexual intercourse in the manner of wild beasts.&quot; Lucretius said it was &quot;generally thought&quot; this manner was best for conception: the proper parts could &quot;take the seeds with chests laid down and loins raised up.&quot;
===English===
The specific origin of the term &quot;doggy style&quot; is not known, but is presumably a reference to the initial position assumed by dogs when mating. It is described in the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; as the &quot;cow position&quot; or &quot;the congress of a cow&quot;, and is listed in &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;.

==Practices==
The posture adopted by the receiving partner resembles lordosis behaviour – a physical posture seen in many female mammals, often when they are ready for sex/mating, the primary characteristic of which is a ventral arching of the spine. During vaginal penetration from behind, the penis may penetrate deeper into the vagina, reaching preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaching the posterior fornix; while in the missionary position, it is in preferential contact with the anterior wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis can reach the anterior fornix.

In this position, the receiving partner implicitly gives the active partner a over their body. Besides other potential sex acts, the active partner may also massage or stimulate the receiving partner&#x27;s erogenous zones, such as the genitals, nipples, buttocks, administer a spanking, or introduce a sex toy, such as a dildo or vibrator, into the vagina or anus. The doggy position may be erotic or sexually provocative for participants.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Doggy style may be a preferred sex position if either partner has back issues or some other medical conditions. During doggy style, the scrotum sometimes provides friction to the clitoris, thus possibly producing an orgasm or sexual stimulation in the woman. For some women, doggy style sex helps to stimulate an area that may be termed &quot;the G-spot&quot;. However, this position may offer only minimal stimulation of the clitoris; so some women may require digital stimulation to achieve orgasm. Some men may, however, be able to stimulate the clitoris simultaneously with the penis and the scrotum respectively during doggy style sex.

Doggy style offers benefits as a sex position in group sex, such as during a threesome. Doggy style allows the passive partner to perform fellatio on male participant (termed &quot;spitroast&quot;) or to perform cunnilingus on a female participant. 

Some women may feel vulnerable in this position, as it requires and implies a level of trust and a surrender of control by the receiving to the active partner. However, some women find this transfer of control to the partner arousing. According to the book &quot;Sexual Pleasure&quot; by Barbara Keesling, many established couples find doggy style relationship-affirming.

Some consider doggy style to be unromantic. The position is considered by some to be less intimate because eye contact and kissing are more difficult. However, in a 2018 survey of millennials it was found to be the most popular sex position.

There are two types of : divided and undivided . The type have divided legs, similar to trousers. Both of these types appear similar. A &quot;mountain&quot; or &quot;field&quot; type of was traditionally worn by field or forest workers. They are looser in the waist and narrower in the leg.

 are secured by four straps (): two longer attached on either side of the front of the garment, and two shorter attached on either side of the rear. The rear of the garment may have a rigid trapezoidal section, called a . Below that on the inside, there may be a (a spoon-shaped component sometimes referred to as a ) which is tucked into the or at the rear, and helps to keep the in place.

, especially those for martial arts, may have seven deep pleats, two on the back and five on the front. Although they appear balanced, the arrangement of the front pleats (two to the right, three to the left) is asymmetrical, and as such is an example of asymmetry in Japanese aesthetics.

Historically, a boy would start wearing his first pair of from the age of five, as commemorated in ; a similar practice to this, called &quot;breeching&quot;, was seen in Europe up until the Victorian age, where boys would from then on start to wear breeches instead of dresses, as a recognition of coming of age.

==Men&#x27;s ==
While used to be a required part of menswear, nowadays typical Japanese men usually wear only on extremely formal occasions and at tea ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. are also regularly worn by practitioners of a variety of martial arts, such as kendo, iaido, taidō, aikido, jōdō, ryū-te, and kyūdō. Sumo wrestlers, who do not wear in the context of their sport, are, however, required to wear traditional Japanese dress whenever they appear in public. As are one of the most important parts of traditional male formal dress, sumo wrestlers are often seen wearing when attending appropriately formal functions.

In addition to martial artists, are also part of the everyday wear of Shinto , priests who maintain and perform services at shrines.

While glossy black-and-white striped are usually worn with formal kimono, stripes in colours other than black, grey and white are worn with less formal wear. Solid and graduated (ombré) colours are also common. For casual wear, men sometimes wear (kimono with just a and no ) or (kimono alone, as for ).

The most formal type of men&#x27;s , , are made of stiff, striped silk, usually black and white, or black and navy blue. These are worn with black kimono (kimono with one, three, or five family crests on the back, chest, and shoulders), white (divided-toe socks), white (under-kimono) and various types of footwear. In cooler weather, a (long jacket) with a white (-fastener) completes the outfit.

Samurai visiting the and other high-ranking at court were sometimes required to wear very long called (). These resemble normal in every way except their remarkable length in both the back and front, forming a train one or two feet long and impeding the ability to walk normally, thus helping to prevent a surprise attack or assassination attempt. are now only worn particularly in Noh plays (including ), kabuki plays, and Shinto rituals.
Some during the Sengoku period had the hems made narrower than the body in imitation of the ballooning trousers worn by the Portuguese. This style carried on into the Edo period and became called . In addition to the taper, they had a secured band of cloth—looking rather like a pants cuff—sewn around each leg&#x27;s hem, so the ballooning fabric would not open out like regular . This variety of was also commonly known as .

To accomplish this, they are somewhat longer than normal , and a cord is run through the hem and drawn tight, creating a &quot;ballooning&quot; effect. To allow for the body required, more formal featured six panels rather than four. Technically, this cord around the ankle makes a type of (tied) . The earliest form of were cut like normal (albeit a bit longer) and have a cord running through the hem of each leg. These cords were pulled tight and tied off at the ankle.

==Women&#x27;s ==

Women&#x27;s differ from men&#x27;s in a variety of ways, most notably fabric design and method of tying.

While men&#x27;s can be worn on both formal and informal occasions, women rarely wear , except at graduation ceremonies and for traditional Japanese sports such as kyūdō, some branches of aikido and kendo. Women do not wear at tea ceremony. The image of women in kimono and are culturally associated with school teachers. Just as university professors in Western countries don their academic caps and gowns when their students graduate, many female school teachers in Japan attend annual graduation ceremonies in traditional kimono with .

 are worn by or shrine maidens who assist in maintenance and ceremonies. A &#x27;s uniform consists of a plain white kimono with a bright red , sometimes a red during formal ceremonies. This look stems from the attire worn by high-ranked aristocratic woman in the Heian era, as well as court performers such as .

While formal men&#x27;s are made of striped fabric, women&#x27;s formal are either a solid colour or dyed with graduating hues. for young women are sometimes sparsely decorated with embroidered flowers such as cherry blossoms. Women typically wear just below the bust line, while men wear them at the waist.

===Dress reform and scholastic use===
 have traditionally been worn as school wear. Before the advent of school uniforms in Japan, students wore everyday clothes, which included for men. In the Meiji period (1868–1912) and Taishō period (1912–1926), Western-style wear was adopted for school uniforms, initially for both male and female uniforms. However, at the time, Western women&#x27;s dress was fairly cumbersome.

Utako Shimoda (1854–1936), a women&#x27;s activist, educator and dress reformer, found traditional kimono to be too restrictive, preventing women and girls from moving and taking part in physical activities, harming their health. While Western dress was being adopted at the time, she also believed corsets to be restrictive and harmful to women&#x27;s health. Shimoda had worked as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōken from 1871 to 1879. She adapted the clothing worn by ladies-in-waiting at the Japanese imperial court to make a uniform for her Jissen Women&#x27;s School. During the Meiji period and Taishō period, other women&#x27;s schools also adopted the . It became standard wear for high schools in Japan, and is still worn for graduation ceremonies.

The image of women in is also culturally associated with school teachers. Just as university professors in Western countries don their academic caps and gowns when their students graduate, many female school teachers in Japan attend annual graduation ceremonies in traditional kimono with .

==Tying ==

There are many ways for men to tie . First, the is tied in a special knot (an &quot;under- knot&quot;) at the rear. Starting with the front, the ties are brought around the waist and crossed over the top of the knot of the . The ties are brought to the front and crossed below the waist, then tied at the back, under the knot of the . The is then tucked behind the , the is adjusted, and the rear ties brought to the front and tied in a variety of ways. The most formal method results in a knot that resembles two bow-ties in a cross shape.

The method of tying the ties is also different, with women&#x27;s being tied in a simpler knot or a bow. As with men&#x27;s , the front ties are first brought to the back, then to the front, then tied at the back in a knot. Then the back are brought around to the front. At this point, they may be tied with a bow at the left hip, just in front of the opening, with the ends of the ties at equal lengths. For more secure fastening, the ties may be wrapped once at center front, then tied inside at the back.

==Folding ==

Like all types of traditional Japanese clothing, it is important to fold and store correctly to prevent damage and prolong the life of the garment, especially those made of silk. With this is particularly important, since have so many pleats which can easily lose their creases; re-creasing the pleats may require specialist attention in extreme cases.

 are often considered particularly challenging to learn to fold properly, in part because of their pleats and in part because their long ties must be correctly smoothed and gathered before being tied in specific patterns.

Various martial arts traditions in which practitioners wear them have prescribed methods of folding the . This is often considered an important part of etiquette.

In some martial arts it is also an old tradition that the highest ranking student has the responsibility to fold the teacher&#x27;s as a token of respect.

<doc id="224080" wikidata="Q334994" url="?curid=224080" title="Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald">
<text>Admiral Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald (14 December 1775 – 31 October 1860), styled Lord Cochrane between 1778 and 1831, was a British naval officer, politician and mercenary. Serving during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars in the Royal Navy, his naval successes led Napoleon to nickname him &quot;le Loup des Mers&quot; (the Sea Wolf). He was successful in virtually all of his naval actions.

Cochrane was dismissed from the Royal Navy in 1814 after a controversial conviction for fraud on the London Stock Exchange. Travelling to South America, he helped to organise and lead the revolutionary navies of Chile and Brazil during their respective wars of independence during the 1820s. While commanding the Chilean Navy, Cochrane also contributed to Peruvian independence through his participation in the Liberating Expedition of Peru. He was also hired to help the Greek Revolutionary Navy during the Greek War of Independence, but ultimately had little impact. In 1832, Cochrane was pardoned by the Crown and reinstated in the Royal Navy with the rank of Rear-Admiral of the Blue. After several more promotions, he died in 1860 with the rank of Admiral of the Red, and the honorary title of Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom.

Cochrane&#x27;s life and exploits inspired the naval fiction of 19th- and 20th-century novelists, particularly the fictional characters Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Jack Aubrey.

==Family==

Thomas Cochrane was born at Annsfield, near Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. He was the son of Archibald, Lord Cochrane (1748–1831), who later became, in October 1778, the 9th Earl of Dundonald, and his wife, Anna Gilchrist. She was the daughter of Captain James Gilchrist and Ann Roberton, the daughter of Major John Roberton, 16th Laird of Earnock.

Thomas, Lord Cochrane, as he himself became in October 1778, had six brothers. Two served with distinction in the military: William Erskine Cochrane of the 15th Dragoons, who served under Sir John Moore in the Peninsular War and reached the rank of major; and Archibald Cochrane, who became a captain in the Navy.

Lord Cochrane was descended from lines of Scottish aristocracy and military service on both sides of his family. Through his uncle, Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, the sixth son of The 8th Earl of Dundonald, Cochrane was cousin to his namesake, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Thomas John Cochrane (1789–1872). Sir Thomas J. Cochrane also had a naval career and was appointed as Governor of Newfoundland and later Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom. By 1793, however, the Cochranes had fallen on hard times; with their fortune spent, the family estate was sold off to cover debts.

==Early life==
Lord Cochrane spent much of his early life in Culross, Fife, where his family had an estate.

Through the influence of his uncle Alexander Cochrane, he was listed as a member of the crew on the books of four Royal Navy ships starting when he was five years old. This common (though unlawful) practice known as &quot;false muster&quot; was a means of gaming naval regulations, enabling well-connected officers to attain the years of service required for promotion if and when they joined the Navy. Cochrane&#x27;s father secured him a commission in the British Army at an early age, but Cochrane preferred the Navy. He joined it in 1793 upon the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars around the time his family lost their wealth and lands.

==Service in the Royal Navy==

===French Revolutionary wars===
On 23 July 1793, aged 17, Cochrane joined the navy as a midshipman, spending his first months at Sheerness in the 28-gun sixth-rate frigate commanded by his uncle Captain Alexander Cochrane. He transferred to the 38-gun fifth-rate , also under his uncle&#x27;s command. While aboard &quot;Thetis&quot;, he visited Norway and next served on the North America Station. In 1795, he was appointed acting lieutenant. The following year on 27 May 1796, he was commissioned lieutenant after passing the examination. After several transfers in North America and a return home in 1798, he was assigned as 8th Lieutenant on Lord Keith&#x27;s flagship in the Mediterranean.

During his service on &quot;Barfleur&quot;, Cochrane was court-martialled for showing disrespect to Philip Beaver, the ship&#x27;s first lieutenant. The board reprimanded him for flippancy. This was the first public manifestation of a pattern of Cochrane being unable to get along with many of his superiors, subordinates, employers, and colleagues in several navies and Parliament, even those with whom he had much in common and who should have been natural allies. His behaviour led to a long enmity with Admiral of the Fleet The 1st Earl of St Vincent.

In February 1800, Cochrane commanded the prize crew taking the captured French vessel to the British base at Mahón. The ship was almost lost in a storm, with Cochrane and his brother Archibald going aloft in place of crew who were mostly ill. Cochrane was promoted to commander and took command of the brig sloop on 28 March 1800. Later that year, a Spanish warship disguised as a merchant ship almost captured him. He escaped by flying a Danish flag and fending off a boarding by claiming that his ship was plague-ridden. On another occasion, he was being chased by an enemy frigate and knew that it would follow him in the night by any glimmer of light from &quot;Speedy&quot;, so he placed a lantern on a barrel and let it float away. The enemy frigate followed the light, and &quot;Speedy&quot; escaped.

In February 1801 at Malta, Cochrane got into an argument with a French Royalist officer at a fancy dress ball. He had arrived dressed as a common sailor, and the Royalist mistook him for one. This argument led to Cochrane&#x27;s only duel. Cochrane wounded the French officer with a pistol shot and was himself unharmed.

One of his most notable exploits was the capture of the Spanish xebec frigate on 6 May 1801. &quot;El Gamo&quot; carried 32 guns and 319 men, compared with &quot;Speedy&quot;″s 14 guns and 54 men. Cochrane flew an American flag and approached so closely to &quot;El Gamo&quot; that her guns could not depress to fire on &quot;Speedy&quot;″s hull. The Spanish tried to board and take over the ship but, whenever they were about to board, Cochrane pulled away briefly and fired on the concentrated boarding parties with his ship&#x27;s guns. Eventually, Cochrane boarded &quot;El Gamo&quot; and captured her, despite being outnumbered about six to one.

Cochrane then took part in the Raid on Oropesa along with HMS &quot;Kangaroo&quot; on 9 June which saw the destruction of a Spanish convoy under the cover of a large on shore battery.

In &quot;Speedy&quot;″s 13-month cruise, Cochrane captured, burned, or drove ashore 53 ships before three French ships of the line under Admiral Charles-Alexandre Linois captured him on 3 July 1801. While Cochrane was held as a prisoner, Linois often asked him for advice. In his autobiography, Cochrane recounted how courteous and polite the French officer had been. A few days later he was exchanged for the second captain of another French ship. On 8 August 1801, he was promoted to the rank of post-captain.

===Napoleonic Wars===

After the Peace of Amiens, Cochrane attended the University of Edinburgh. Upon the resumption of war in 1803, St Vincent assigned him in October 1803 to command the sixth-rate 22-gun . Cochrane alleged that the vessel handled poorly, colliding with Royal Navy ships on two occasions (&quot;Bloodhound&quot; and &quot;Abundance&quot;). In his autobiography, he compared &quot;Arab&quot; to a collier. He wrote that his first thoughts on seeing &quot;Arab&quot; being repaired at Plymouth were that she would &quot;sail like a haystack&quot;. Despite this, he intercepted and boarded the American merchant ship &quot;Chatham&quot;. This created an international incident, for Britain was not at war with the United States. &quot;Arab&quot; and her commander were assigned to protect Britain&#x27;s important whaling fleet beyond Orkney in the North Sea.

In 1804, Lord St Vincent stood aside for the incoming new government led by William Pitt the Younger, and The 1st Viscount Melville took office. In December of that year, Cochrane was appointed to command of the new 32-gun frigate . He undertook a series of notable exploits over the following eighteen months one of which was a cruise in the vicinity of the Azores. Here &quot;Pallas&quot; captured three Spanish merchant ships and a Spanish 14-gun privateer.

In August 1806, he took command of the 38-gun frigate , formerly the Spanish frigate &quot;Medea&quot;. One of his midshipmen was Frederick Marryat, who later wrote fictionalised accounts of his adventures with Cochrane.

In &quot;Imperieuse&quot;, Cochrane raided the Mediterranean coast of France during the continuing Napoleonic Wars. In 1808, Cochrane and a Spanish guerrilla force captured the fortress of Mongat, which straddled the road between Gerona and Barcelona. This delayed General Duhesme&#x27;s French army for a month. On another raid, Cochrane copied code books from a signal station, leaving behind the originals so that the French would believe them uncompromised. When &quot;Imperieuse&quot; ran short of water, she sailed up the estuary of the Rhone to replenish. A French army marched into Catalonia and besieged Rosas, and Cochrane took part in the defence of the town. He occupied and defended Fort Trinidad (Castell de la Trinitat) for a number of weeks before the fall of the city forced him to leave; Cochrane was one of the last two men to quit the fort.

While captain of &quot;Speedy&quot;, &quot;Pallas&quot;, and &quot;Imperieuse&quot;, Cochrane became an effective practitioner of coastal warfare during the period. He attacked shore installations such as the Martello tower at Son Bou on Menorca, and he captured enemy ships in harbour by leading his men in boats. He was a meticulous planner of every operation, which limited casualties among his men and maximised the chances of success.

In 1809, Cochrane commanded the attack by a flotilla of fire ships on Rochefort, as part of the Battle of the Basque Roads. The attack did considerable damage, but Cochrane blamed fleet commander Admiral Gambier for missing the opportunity to destroy the French fleet, accusations that resulted in Gambier undergoing a court-martial. Cochrane claimed that, as a result of expressing his opinion publicly, the admiralty denied him the opportunity to serve at sea. However, documents show that Cochrane was focused on politics at this time and refused offers of command.

==Political career==

In June 1806, Lord Cochrane stood for the House of Commons on a ticket of parliamentary reform (a movement which later brought about the Reform Acts) for the potwalloper borough of Honiton in Devon. This was exactly the kind of borough that Cochrane proposed to abolish; votes were mostly sold to the highest bidder. Cochrane offered nothing and lost the election. In October 1806, he ran for Parliament in Honiton and won. Cochrane initially denied that he paid any bribes, but he revealed in a Parliamentary debate ten years later that he had paid ten guineas (£10 10s) per voter through Mr. Townshend, local headman and banker.

In May 1807, Cochrane was elected by Westminster in a more democratic election. He had campaigned for parliamentary reform, allied with such Radicals as William Cobbett, Sir Francis Burdett, and Henry Hunt. His outspoken criticism of the conduct of the war and the corruption in the navy made him powerful enemies in the government. His criticism of Admiral Gambier&#x27;s conduct at the Battle of the Basque Roads was so severe that Gambier demanded a court-martial to clear his name. Cochrane made important enemies in the Admiralty during this period.

In 1810, Sir Francis Burdett, a member of parliament and political ally, had barricaded himself in his home at Piccadilly, London, resisting arrest by the House of Commons. Cochrane went to assist Burdett&#x27;s defence of the house. His intended actions, similar to those he had used in the navy, would have led to numerous deaths amongst the arresting officers and at least partial destruction of Burdett&#x27;s house, along with much of Piccadilly. On realising what Cochrane planned, Burdett and his allies took steps to end the siege.

Cochrane was popular with the public but was unable to get along with his colleagues in the House of Commons or within the government. He usually had little success in promoting his causes. An exception was his successful confrontation of a prize court in 1814.

His conviction in the Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814 resulted in Parliament expelling him on 5 July 1814. However, his constituents in the seat of Westminster re-elected him at the resulting by-election on 16 July. He held this seat until 1818. In 1818, Cochrane&#x27;s last speech in Parliament advocated parliamentary reform.

In 1830, Cochrane initially expressed interest in running for Parliament but then declined. Lord Brougham&#x27;s brother had decided to run for the seat, and Cochrane also thought that it would look bad for him to be publicly supporting a government from which he sought pardon for his fraud conviction.

In 1831, his father died and Cochrane became the 10th Earl of Dundonald. As such, he was no longer entitled to sit in the Commons.

While serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station, Cochrane became acquainted with geologist and physicist Abraham Gesner in Halifax. The pair planned a commercial venture that would supply Halifax with lamp oil and mine bitumen deposits in Trinidad and Albert Country, New Brunswick. By 1850, Cochrane had purchased all the land surrounding Trinidad&#x27;s pitch lake in support of the endeavour. Ultimately, the enterprise did not come into fruition, and Cochrane returned to England after his term of service expired in April 1851.

==Marriage and children==

In 1812, Cochrane married Katherine (&quot;Katy&quot;) Frances Corbet Barnes, a beautiful orphan who was about twenty years his junior. They met through Cochrane&#x27;s cousin Nathaniel Day Cochrane. This was an elopement and a civil ceremony, due to the opposition of his wealthy uncle Basil Cochrane, who disinherited his nephew as a result. Cochrane called Katherine &quot;Kate,&quot; &quot;Kitty,&quot; or &quot;Mouse&quot; in letters to her; she often accompanied her husband on his extended campaigns in South America and Greece.

Cochrane and Katherine remarried in the Anglican Church in 1818, and in the Church of Scotland in 1825. They had six children:
* Thomas Barnes Cochrane, 11th Earl of Dundonald, b. 18 April 1814, m. Louisa Harriett McKinnon.

The remarriage prompted suspicion that Cochrane&#x27;s first son Thomas was illegitimate. Investigation of this delayed Thomas&#x27;s accession to the Earldom of Dundonald on his father&#x27;s death.

In 1823 Lady Cochrane sailed with her children to Valparaiso on to join her husband. &quot;Sesostris&quot; stopped at Rio de Janeiro on 13 June, where she discovered that he was there, having in March taken command of the Brazilian Navy.

Following Cochrane&#x27;s return from Greece, the couple disagreed about his spending on inventions and her spending on socialising, which led to their separation in 1839. Katherine moved to Boulogne-sur-Mer with a generous allowance, occasionally visiting London but never staying with her husband. She died in Boulogne in 1865, aged 69.

==Great Stock Exchange Fraud==

In February 1814, rumours began to circulate of Napoleon&#x27;s death. The claims were seemingly confirmed by a man in a red staff officer&#x27;s uniform identified as Colonel de Bourg, aide-de-camp to Lord Cathcart, the British ambassador to Russia. He arrived in Dover from France on 21 February bearing news that Napoleon had been captured and killed by Cossacks. Share prices rose sharply on the Stock Exchange in reaction to the news and the possibility of peace, particularly in volatile partly-paid government securities called Omniums, which increased from to 32. However, it soon became clear that the news of Napoleon&#x27;s death was a hoax. The Stock Exchange established a sub-committee to investigate, and they discovered that six men had sold substantial amounts of Omnium stock during the boom in value. The committee assumed that all six were responsible for the hoax and subsequent fraud. Cochrane had disposed of his entire £139,000 holding in Omnium () – which he had only acquired a month before – and was named as one of the six conspirators, as were his uncle Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone and his stockbroker, Richard Butt. Within days, an anonymous informant told the committee that Colonel de Bourg was an imposter: he was a Prussian aristocrat named Charles Random de Berenger. He had also been seen entering Cochrane&#x27;s house on the day of the hoax.

The accused were brought to trial in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, Guildhall on 8 June 1814. The trial was presided over by Lord Ellenborough, a High Tory and a notable enemy of the radicals, who had previously convicted and sentenced to prison radical politicians William Cobbett and Henry Hunt in politically motivated trials. The evidence against Cochrane was circumstantial and hinged on the nature of his share dealings, his contacts with the conspirators, and the colour of uniform which De Berenger had been wearing when they met in his house. Cochrane admitted that he was acquainted with De Berenger and that the man had visited his home on the day of the fraud, but insisted that he had arrived wearing a green sharpshooter&#x27;s uniform rather than the red uniform worn by the person who claimed to be de Bourg. Cochrane said that De Berenger had visited to request passage to the United States aboard Cochrane&#x27;s new command . Cochrane&#x27;s servants agreed, in an affidavit created before the trial, that the collar of the uniform above De Berenger&#x27;s greatcoat had been green. However, they admitted to Cochrane&#x27;s solicitors that they thought the rest had been red. They were not called at trial to give evidence. The prosecution summoned as key witness hackney carriage driver William Crane, who swore that De Berenger was wearing a scarlet uniform when he delivered him to the house. Cochrane&#x27;s defence also argued that he had given standing instructions to Butt that his Omnium shares were to be sold if the price rose by 1 per cent, and he would have made double profit if he waited until it reached its peak price.

On the second day of the trial, Lord Ellenborough began his summary of the evidence and drew attention to the matter of De Berenger&#x27;s uniform; he concluded that witnesses had provided damning evidence. The jury retired to deliberate and returned a verdict of guilty against all the defendants two-and-a-half hours later. Belatedly, Cochrane&#x27;s defence team found several witnesses who were willing to testify that De Berenger had arrived wearing a green uniform, but Lord Ellenborough dismissed their evidence as inadmissible because two of the conspirators had fled the country upon hearing the guilty verdict. On 20 June 1814, Cochrane was sentenced to 12 months&#x27; imprisonment, fined £1,000, and ordered to stand in the pillory opposite the Royal Exchange for one hour. In subsequent weeks, he was dismissed from the Royal Navy by the Admiralty and expelled from Parliament following a motion in the House of Commons which was passed by 144 votes to 44. On the orders of the Prince Regent, Cochrane was humiliated by the loss of his appointment Knight of the Order of the Bath in a degradation ceremony at Westminster Abbey. His banner was taken down and physically kicked out of the chapel and down the outside steps. But, within a month, Cochrane was re-elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament for Westminster. Following a public outcry, his sentence to the pillory was rescinded for fears that it would lead to the outbreak of a riot.

The question of Cochrane&#x27;s innocence or guilt created much debate at the time, and it has divided historians ever since. Subsequent reviews of the trial carried out by three Lord Chancellors during the course of the 19th century concluded that he ought to have been found not guilty on the basis of the evidence produced in court. Cochrane maintained his innocence for the rest of his life, and campaigned tirelessly to restore his damaged reputation and to clear his name. He believed that the trial was politically motivated and that a &quot;higher authority than the Stock Exchange&quot; was responsible for his prosecution. A series of petitions put forward by Cochrane protesting his innocence were ignored until 1830. That year, King George IV (the former Prince Regent) died and was succeeded by William IV. He had served in the Royal Navy and was sympathetic to Cochrane&#x27;s cause. Later that year, the Tory government fell and was replaced by a Whig government in which his friend Lord Brougham was appointed Lord Chancellor. Following a meeting of the Privy Council in May 1832, Cochrane was granted a pardon and restored to the Navy List with a promotion to rear-admiral. Support from friends in the government and the writings of popular naval authors such as Frederick Marryat and Maria Graham increased public sympathy for Cochrane&#x27;s situation. Cochrane&#x27;s knighthood was restored in May 1847 with the personal intervention of Queen Victoria, and he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. Only in 1860 was his banner returned to Westminster Abbey; it was the day before his funeral.

In 1876, his grandson received a payment of £40,000 from the British government (), based on the recommendations of a Parliamentary select committee, in compensation for Cochrane&#x27;s conviction. The committee had concluded that his conviction was unjust.

==Service with other navies==
===Chilean Navy===

Lord Cochrane left the UK in official disgrace, but that did not end his naval career. In 1817, Lord Cochrane placed a notice in one of the leading London newspapers that he was available to go and serve the newly becoming independent nations in America or others.
But in London, in 1818, he was met by the representative sent by General José de San Martín, José Antonio Álvarez Condarco, who convinced him in May to join the cause for the Hispano-American independence and go to Chile together alongside a number of British officers who also wanted to be hired. Accompanied by Lady Cochrane and their two children, he reached Valparaíso on 28 November 1818. Chile was rapidly organising its new navy for its war of independence.

Cochrane became a Chilean citizen on 11 December 1818 at the request of Chilean leader Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins. He was appointed Vice Admiral and took command of the Chilean Navy in Chile&#x27;s war of independence against Spain. He was the first Vice Admiral of Chile. Cochrane reorganised the Chilean navy with British commanders, introducing British naval customs and, formally, English-speaking governance in their warships. He took command in the frigate and blockaded and raided the coasts of Peru, as he had those of France and Spain. On his own initiative, he organised and led the capture of Valdivia, despite only having 300 men and two ships to deploy against seven large forts. He failed in his attempt to capture the Chiloé Archipelago for Chile.

In 1820, O&#x27;Higgins ordered him to convoy the Liberating Expedition of Peru under General José de San Martín to Peru, blockade the coast, and support the campaign for independence. Later, forces under Cochrane&#x27;s personal command cut out and captured the frigate , the most powerful Spanish ship in South America. All of this led to Peruvian independence, which O&#x27;Higgins considered indispensable to Chile&#x27;s security. Cochrane&#x27;s victories in the Pacific were spectacular and important. The excitement was almost immediately marred by his accusations that he had been plotted against by subordinates and treated with contempt and denied adequate financial reward by his superiors. The evidence does not support these accusations, and the problem appeared to lie in Cochrane&#x27;s own suspicious and uneasy personality. Cochrane had an uneasy relation with San Martín who was serene and calculating in contrast with Cochrane&#x27;s tendency for audacious actions. San Martín criticized Cochrane&#x27;s interest for financial gain giving him the nickname &quot;El Metálico Lord&quot; (The Metallic Lord).

Loose words from his wife Katy resulted in a rumour that Cochrane had made plans to free Napoleon from his exile on Saint Helena and make him ruler of a unified South American state. This could not have been true because Charles, the supposed envoy bearing the rumoured plans, had been killed two months before his reported &quot;departure to Europe&quot;. Cochrane left the service of the Chilean Navy on 29 November 1822.

====Chilean naval vessels named after Lord Cochrane====
The Chilean Navy has named five ships &quot;Cochrane&quot; or &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; (Admiral Cochrane) in his honour:
* The first, , was a battery ship that fought in the War of the Pacific (1879–1884).
* The second &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; was a dreadnought battleship laid down in Britain in 1913. The Royal Navy acquired the unfinished ship in 1917, converting her into the aircraft carrier .
* The third ship, , was a , the former , commissioned into the Chilean Navy in 1962 and scrapped in 1983.
* The fourth ship, , was a , the former , which the Chilean Navy acquired in 1984 and decommissioned in 2006.
* The fifth and current ship to bear the name, , is a Type 23 frigate, the former , which the Chilean Navy commissioned in 2006.

===Imperial Brazilian Navy===

Brazil was fighting its own war of independence against Portugal. In 1822, the southern provinces (except Montevideo, now in Uruguay) came under the control of the patriots led by the Prince Regent, later Emperor Pedro I. Portugal still controlled some important provincial capitals in the north, with major garrisons and naval bases such as Belém do Pará, Salvador da Bahia, and São Luís do Maranhão.

Lord Cochrane took command of the Imperial Brazilian Navy on 21 March 1823 and was appointed &quot;First Admiral of the National and Imperial Navy&quot; at the flagship &quot;Pedro I&quot;. He blockaded the Portuguese in Bahia, confronted them at the Battle of 4 May, and forced them to evacuate the province in a vast convoy of ships which Cochrane&#x27;s men attacked as they crossed the Atlantic. Cochrane sailed to Maranhão (then spelled Maranham) on his own initiative and bluffed the garrison into surrender by claiming that a vast (and mythical) Brazilian fleet and army were over the horizon. He sent subordinate Captain John Pascoe Grenfell to Belém do Pará to use the same bluff and extract a Portuguese surrender. As a result of Cochrane&#x27;s efforts, Brazil became totally &quot;de facto&quot; independent and free of any Portuguese troops. On Cochrane&#x27;s return to Rio de Janeiro in 1824, Emperor Pedro I rewarded the officer by granting him the non-hereditary title of Marquess of Maranhão (&quot;Marquês do Maranhão&quot;) in the Empire of Brazil. He was also awarded an accompanying coat of arms.

As in Chile and earlier occasions, Cochrane&#x27;s joy at these successes was rapidly replaced by quarrels over pay and prize money, and an accusation that the Brazilian authorities were plotting against him.

In mid-1824, Cochrane sailed north with a squadron to assist the Brazilian army under General Francisco Lima e Silva in suppressing a republican rebellion in the state of Pernambuco which had begun to spread to Maranhão and other northern states. The rebellion was rapidly extinguished. Cochrane proceeded to Maranhão, where he took over the administration. He demanded the payment of prize money which he claimed he was owed as a result of the recapture of the province in 1823. He absconded with public money and sacked merchant ships anchored in São Luís do Maranhão. Defying orders to return to Rio de Janeiro, Cochrane transferred to a captured Brazilian frigate, left Brazil and returned to Britain where he arrived in late June 1825.

===Greek Navy===
In August 1825 Cochrane was hired by Greece to support its fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire, which had deployed an army raised in Egypt to suppress the Greek rebellion. He took an active role in the campaign between March 1827 and December 1828, but met with limited success. His subordinate Captain Hastings attacked Ottoman forces at the Gulf of Lepanto, which indirectly led to intervention by Great Britain, France, and Russia. They succeeded in destroying the Turko–Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Navarino, and the war was ended under mediation of the Great Powers. He resigned his commission toward the end of the war and returned to Britain.

==Return to Royal Navy==
Lord Cochrane inherited his peerage following his father&#x27;s death on 1 July 1831, becoming The 10th Earl of Dundonald. He was restored to the Royal Navy list on 2 May 1832 as a Rear-Admiral of the Blue. The full return of Lord Dundonald, as he was now known, to Royal Navy service was delayed by his refusal to take a command until his knighthood had been restored, which took 15 years. He continued to receive promotions in the list of flag officers, as follows:
* Rear-Admiral of the Blue on 2 May 1832
* Rear-Admiral of the White on 10 January 1837
* Rear-Admiral of the Red on 28 June 1838
* Vice-Admiral of the Blue on 23 November 1841
* Vice-Admiral of the White on 9 November 1846
* Vice-Admiral of the Red on 3 January 1848
* Admiral of the Blue on 21 March 1851
* Admiral of the White on 2 April 1853
* Admiral of the Red on 8 December 1857

On 22 May 1847, Queen Victoria reappointed him Knight of the Order of the Bath. He returned to the Royal Navy, serving as Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station from 1848 to 1851. During the Crimean War, the government considered him for a command in the Baltic, but decided that there was too high a chance that Lord Dundonald would risk the fleet in a daring attack. On 6 November 1854, he was appointed to the honorary office of Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom, an office that he retained until his death.

In his final years, Lord Dundonald wrote his autobiography in collaboration with G.B. Earp. He twice had to undergo painful surgery for kidney stones in 1860 with his health deteriorating. He died during the second operation on 31 October 1860 in Kensington.

Dundonald was buried in Westminster Abbey; his grave is in the central part of the nave. Each year in May, representatives of the Chilean Navy hold a wreath-laying ceremony at his grave.

==Innovations in technology==
Convoys were guided by ships following the lamps of those ahead. In 1805, Lord Cochrane entered a Royal Navy competition for a superior convoy lamp. He believed that the judges were biased against him, so he re-entered the contest under another name and won the prize.

In 1806, Cochrane had a galley made to his specifications which he carried on board &quot;Pallas&quot; and used to attack the French coast. It had the advantage of mobility and flexibility.

In 1812, Lord Cochrane proposed attacking the French coast using a combination of bombardment ships, explosion ships, and &quot;stink vessels&quot; (gas warfare). A bombardment ship consisted of a strengthened old hulk filled with powder and shot and made to list to one side. It was anchored at night to face the enemy behind the harbour wall. When set off, it provided saturation bombardment of the harbour, which would be closely followed by landings of troops. He put the plans forward again before and during the Crimean War. The authorities, however, decided not to pursue his plans.

In 1818, Cochrane patented the tunnelling shield together with engineer Marc Isambard Brunel, which Brunel and his son used in building the Thames Tunnel in 1825–43. Cochrane also patented the first airlock in 1830, and in 1879 his airlock setup was used to assist with tunnelling under the Hudson River in New York.

During 1851–1853, he filed in England a series of comprehensive patents covering the applications of natural asphalt. These patents were confined chiefly to the use of asphalt as a paving material, as a mastic, as a &quot;hydraulic concrete&quot; suitable for fashioning into water pipes and sewer mains and as an insulating material for electric wires.

Cochrane was an early supporter of steamships. He tried to take the steamship from Britain to Chile for use in the war of independence in the 1820s, but its construction took too long; it did not arrive until the war was ending. &quot;Rising Star&quot; was a 410-ton vessel adapted to a new design at Brent&#x27;s Yard at the Greenland Dock at the Thames: twin funnels, a retractable paddle wheel, and driven by a 60-horsepower engine. Similarly, he suffered delays with construction of a steamship which he had hoped to put into use in the Greek War of Independence. In the 1830s, Lord Dundonald, as he now was, experimented with steam power, developing a rotary engine and a propeller. In 1851, Lord Dundonald received a patent on powering steamships with bitumen. He was conferred with Honorary Membership in the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1857.

==Burial and memorial==
Lord Dundonald was interred in Westminster Abbey in the floor of the nave directly before the choir. The procession was led by dean Bradley (robed as Chancellor of the Order of Bath). Persons involved were: The Brazilian Minister in London and his entire staff (in full levée dress), 12th Earl of Dundonald (wearing a general&#x27;s uniform), Captain Duarte de Bacella (of the &quot;Floriano&quot;), First Lieutenant Arthur Thompson, Lieutenant Eduardo de Procuca, and Lieutenant Oscar Gomes Bruza (of the same vessel). The captain and his chief lieutenant carried extra wreaths as personal offerings from the Brazilian warship&#x27;s company and from her officers.

The Brazilian Minister uttered these words; &quot;We place these flowers on Lord Cochrane&#x27;s grave in the name of the Brazilian Navy, which he created, and of the Brazilian nation, to whose independence and unity he rendered incomparable services.&quot; Lord Cochrane&#x27;s grandson, Douglas Cochrane, 12th Earl of Dundonald, replied to the minister by saying: &quot;Senhor Nabuco, on behalf of my grandfather&#x27;s family, I thank the Brazilian Navy and the Brazilian people for this tribute of respect to his memory.&quot;

His epitaph, written by Sir Lyon Playfair, reads:

&#x27;Here rests in his 85th year Thomas Cochrane Tenth Earl of Dundonald of Paisley and of Ochiltree in the Peerage of Scotland Marquess of Marenham in the Empire of Brazil GCB and Admiral of the Fleet who by his confidence and genius his science and extraordinary daring inspired by his heroic exertion in the cause of freedom and his splended services alike to his own country, Greece, Brazil, Chile and Peru achieved a name illustrious throughout the world for courage, patriotism and chivalry. Born Dec 14 1775. Died Oct 31 1860&#x27;

===Influence on naval fiction===
His career inspired a number of writers of nautical fiction. The first was Captain Frederick Marryat, who had served under him as a midshipman and published his first novel in 1829. In the 20th century, the figures and careers of Horatio Hornblower in the novels by C. S. Forester and of Jack Aubrey in the Aubrey–Maturin series of novels by Patrick O&#x27;Brian were in part modelled on his exploits.

<text>Mishpat Ivri (, &quot;Jewish/Hebrew law/jurisprudence&quot;) are the aspects of &quot;halakha&quot; (&quot;traditional Jewish law&quot;) that are relevant to non-religious or secular law. In addition, the term refers to an academic approach to the Jewish legal tradition and a concomitant effort to apply that tradition to modern Israeli law. 

==History==
The idea of &quot;mishpat ivri&quot; as a western-style body of laws, distinct from the halakha which was deemed religious in nature, appeared in Mandate Palestine as a part of the zionist revivalist movement.

==Overview==
The academic study of &quot;Mishpat Ivri&quot; spans the full geographic, literary, and historical range of &quot;halakha&quot;. It tends to exclude certain areas of &quot;halakha&quot; that are not comparable to modern civil law, such as criminal law and religious law.

Subjects covered in &quot;Mishpat Ivri&quot; include: property rights, torts (called damages in Jewish law), contracts, public law, international law, sales, renting, ownership, negligence, legal liability, and copyright.

Within classical rabbinic Judaism, all &quot;Mishpat Ivri&quot; subjects are also subsumed under &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law in general).

Scholars of &quot;Mishpat Ivri&quot; typically adopt methodologies based on legal positivism. Notably, Menachem Elon adopts a legal positivist approach in his extensive study (Elon 1994), which has been used to train Israeli law students at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. While useful for comparative law purposes, the legal positivist approach to &quot;Mishpat Ivri&quot; has been questioned by some scholars, such as Hanina Ben-Menahem and Bernard Jackson. 

In the modern State of Israel, &quot;Mishpat Ivri&quot; has become one of the lesser ongoing sources for contemporary Israeli civil law, which developed along the model of British common law. (Israeli civil law was built primarily upon British and Ottoman law.) As an effort to promote Jewish law, the Mishpat Ivri movement has had relatively few gains, which include: (1) the Foundations of Law Act of 1980, allowing judicial reasoning to draw upon &quot;halakha&quot;, (2) the limited accretion of case law that refers to &quot;halakha&quot;, (3) occasional references to &quot;halakha&quot; in legislative deliberations, and (4) the placement of a Mishpat Ivri expert in the Attorney General&#x27;s office, who has prepared bibliographies that document the references to &quot;halakha&quot; in Israel case law and legislation. The limited relevance of Mishpat Ivri to Israeli civil law may be contrasted with the dominant jurisdiction of rabbinic law courts in an Israeli marriage and divorce law.

<doc id="224086" wikidata="Q332616" url="?curid=224086" title="Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe (8 March 1726 – 5 August 1799) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. After serving in the War of the Austrian Succession, he gained a reputation for his role in amphibious operations against the French coast as part of Britain&#x27;s policy of naval descents during the Seven Years&#x27; War. He also took part, as a naval captain, in the decisive British naval victory at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759.

In North America, Howe is best known for his service during the American War of Independence, when he acted as a naval commander and a peace commissioner with the American rebels; he also conducted a successful relief during the Great Siege of Gibraltar in the later stages of the War. Howe later commanded the victorious British fleet during the Glorious First of June in June 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars.

== Early career ==
Howe was born in Albemarle Street, London, the second son of Emanuel Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe, who died as governor of Barbados in March 1735, and of Charlotte, a daughter of Baroness von Kielmansegg, afterwards Countess of Darlington, the half-sister of King George I.

After education at Eton College, Richard Howe entered the navy in the fourth-rate in July 1739. He then transferred to the fourth-rate , one of the squadron sent into the south seas with Admiral George Anson in 1740. &quot;Severn&quot; sailed to Cape Horn and then, after encountering storms, returned home in Spring 1742. Howe next served in the West Indies aboard the third-rate and was present when she was severely damaged in the unsuccessful attack on La Guaira in February 1743 during the War of the Austrian Succession. He transferred to the third-rate , flagship of Admiral Sir Charles Knowles, Commander-in-Chief in the West Indies, in March 1743 and then to the fifth-rate in July 1743, before being promoted to midshipman on 8 October 1743 and returning to HMS &quot;Suffolk&quot; later that month. Promoted to lieutenant on 25 May 1744, he joined the bomb vessel and then transferred to the first-rate HMS &quot;Royal George&quot;, flagship of Admiral Edward Vernon, in August 1745.
Promoted to commander on 5 November 1745, Howe was commanding officer of the sloop in the North Sea during the Jacobite rising of 1745 and was severely wounded in the head while cooperating with a frigate in an engagement with two French privateers. Promoted to post-captain on 10 April 1746, he was given command of the sixth-rate and took part in convoy duties off Lisbon. He transferred to the command of the fourth-rate in Summer 1747 and sailed to the West Indies before becoming Flag Captain to Admiral Sir Charles Knowles, Commander-in-Chief, Jamaica, in the third-rate in October 1748. He was given command of the fifth-rate off the coast of West Africa in March 1751 and then transferred to the command of the sixth-rate in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1752.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
In January 1755, Howe was given command of the fourth-rate and was sent to North America as part of a squadron commanded by Admiral Edward Boscawen: his capture of the French &quot;Alcide&quot; was the first shot fired in the Seven Years&#x27; War. He was elected member of parliament for Dartmouth in May 1757 and became commanding officer of the third-rate in the Channel in July 1757. From then until the peace of 1763, he served in the Channel in various more or less futile expeditions against the French coast, gaining a reputation as a firm and skillful officer for his role in the series of naval descents on the French coast including the Raid on Rochefort in September 1757. Promoted to commodore, with his broad pennant in the third-rate , he took part in the Raid on St Malo in June 1758, the Raid on Cherbourg in August 1758 and the Battle of Saint Cast in September 1758. He was particularly noted for his conduct at Rochefort, where he had taken the Île-d&#x27;Aix, and was described by George Rodney as performing his duties &quot;with such cool and steady resolution, as has most justly gained him the universal applause of army and navy&quot;.

After the death of his elder brother, killed near Ticonderoga on 6 July 1758, Howe became Viscount Howe in the Peerage of Ireland. On 20 November 1759, he led Admiral Edward Hawke&#x27;s fleet at the Battle of Quiberon Bay where the British won a decisive victory, forestalling a planned French invasion of Britain. He became Flag Captain to Rear-Admiral the Duke of York in the third-rate in June 1762.

Howe was appointed to the Board of Admiralty led by John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich as Senior Naval Lord in April 1763. He became Treasurer of the Navy in 1765 and, having been promoted to rear admiral on 18 October 1770, went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet in November 1770. Promoted to vice admiral on 5 February 1776, he became Commander-in-Chief, North American Station later that month.

==American War of Independence==

At the beginning of the American War of Independence, Howe was known to be sympathetic to the colonists. He had known Benjamin Franklin since late 1774 and was joined in a commission with his brother, General Sir William Howe, head of the land forces, to attempt a reconciliation.

===Blockade===

Howe was ordered to institute a naval blockade of the American coastline, but this proved to be ineffective. Howe claimed to have too few ships to successfully accomplish this, particularly as a number had to be detached to support operations by the British Army. As a result, large amounts of covert French supplies and munitions were smuggled to America. It has been suggested that Howe&#x27;s limited blockade at this point was driven by his sympathy with and desire for conciliation with the Americans. By 1778 the blockade was looking more promising, with many merchant ships being taken. Howe complained to London that while his ships were able to successfully guard the southern colonies, the blockade of the northern colonies was still ineffective.

===New York and Philadelphia===
The strategy of the British in North America was to deploy a combination of operations aimed at capturing major cities and a blockade of the coast. The British took Long Island in August 1776 and captured New York City in September 1776 in combined operations involving the army and the navy during the New York and New Jersey campaign. He represented the Crown at the Staten Island Peace Conference held on 11 September 1776. In 1777 Howe provided support to his brother&#x27;s operation to capture Philadelphia, ferrying General Howe&#x27;s army to a landing point from which they successfully marched and took the city. Howe spent much of the remainder of the year concentrating on capturing Forts Mifflin and Mercer which controlled entry to the Delaware River without which ships could not reach Philadelphia. News of the capture of a separate British army under General John Burgoyne threw British plans into disarray. Howe spent the winter in Newport, Rhode Island.

===Return to England===

In Summer 1778 a French squadron commanded by the Comte d&#x27;Estaing was sent to America. Howe&#x27;s fleet was delayed departing New York by contrary winds, and he arrived off Point Judith on 9 August. Since d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s fleet outnumbered Howe&#x27;s, the French admiral, fearful that Howe would be further reinforced and eventually gain a numerical advantage, reboarded the French troops, and sailed out to do battle with Howe on 10 August. As the two fleets prepared to battle and manoeuvred for position, the weather deteriorated, and a major storm broke out. Raging for two days, the storm scattered both fleets, severely damaging the French flagship. As the two fleets sought to regroup, individual ships encountered enemy ships, and there were several minor naval skirmishes; two French ships (including d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s flagship), already suffering storm damage, were badly mauled in these encounters. The French fleet regrouped off Delaware, and returned to Newport on 20 August, while the British fleet regrouped at New York.

Three of Howe&#x27;s ships, the sixth-rate , the converted merchantman and the row galley HMS &quot;Spitfire Galley&quot;, bombarded American troops during the Battle of Rhode Island on 29 August. Howe then chased the remaining ships of the French fleet to Boston in Massachusetts where they made repairs. With no prospect of the French fleet coming out of port, Howe left his station in September 1778.

Declining to serve afterwards, Howe cited distrust of Lord North and a lack of support during his command in America. He was further embittered by the replacement of himself and his brother as peace commissioners, as well as by attacks in the press against him by ministerial writers including the prominent Loyalist Joseph Galloway. An inquiry in Parliament demanded by the Howe brothers to justify their conduct in America was held during 1779 but ended inconclusively. Howe spent much of the next three years with the opposition attacking the government&#x27;s alleged mismanagement of the war at sea. The only exception was his support of a motion of thanks to Admiral George Rodney for his victory against the Spanish during the Moonlight Battle.

As Howe had joined the opposition in Parliament to North&#x27;s government, it was clear that until it was replaced he would be unable to secure a fresh naval command. Despite the setback at Saratoga, and the entry of France, Spain and the Dutch Republic into the war, North&#x27;s government continued to gain strength until October 1781 when a British army under Lord Cornwallis was forced to surrender to a combined Franco-American force at Yorktown. Although the government was able to continue for several more months its effective power had been sapped. In March 1782 the House of Commons passed a motion ending offensive actions against the American rebels, although the war around the rest of the globe continued with the same intensity. North&#x27;s government then fell and was replaced by a weak coalition of Whigs led by the Marquess of Rockingham.

===Command of the Channel Fleet===

Not until the fall of Lord North&#x27;s government in March 1782 did Howe once again accept a command. Despite the suspension of hostilities in America, the war in Europe continued with the same force and the Royal Navy was severely stretched in having to deal with the French, Spanish and Dutch fleets. Howe received instructions from Augustus Keppel, the new First Lord of the Admiralty to proceed to Portsmouth and take command of the Channel Fleet which he did in April 1782. Promoted to full admiral on 8 April 1782, he was created Viscount Howe in the Peerage of Great Britain on 20 April 1782.

Howe&#x27;s task was complex. He had to protect inbound trade convoys from the Americas, keep track of the Franco-Spanish fleet, while also keeping an eye on the Dutch fleet at port in the Texel but reportedly ready to sail. He also had to keep in mind the need to attempt a relief of Gibraltar which had been under siege for several years and would be forced to surrender if it wasn&#x27;t resupplied soon. Howe had to accomplish these tasks with significantly fewer ships than his combined opponents. Keppel observed the Royal Navy&#x27;s best hope was quickly to shift their limited forces from one area of danger to another.

In May Howe took a number of ships to the Dutch coast to scout out Dutch preparations. If the Dutch made a sortie into the North Sea they would be able to threaten Britain&#x27;s vital Baltic convoys, including precious naval stores which were needed for continuing the war. This in turn might lead the Dutch to launch attacks on the East coast of England. As the Dutch fleet appeared unlikely to immediately put to sea, Howe returned to Britain leaving a squadron of nine ships to keep a watch on the Texel. The French and Spanish fleets had sailed from Brest and Cádiz and combined in the Western Approaches, where they managed to capture some merchant ships. Howe put to sea to try and monitor them, and received information that a major trade convoy was incoming from the West Indies.

Howe had only 25 ships-of-the-line against 36 enemy ships under Admiral Córdoba and was separated by them from the convoy he was ordered to protect. He sent a message for the convoy to put into safety in ports in Ireland. Howe then took his fleet through a dangerous route, around the north side of the Isles of Scilly. This allowed him to get between the inbound convoy and the Franco-Spanish fleet as well as allowing him to gain the weather gauge which would be a major advantage in any battle. The next morning the Franco-Spanish fleet had disappeared. After waiting a while Howe decided to go in pursuit of them, later receiving news that the West Indian convoy had safely reached harbour in the English Channel. The Franco-Spanish fleet had been blown southwards by a strong gale, and then received orders in early August to return home.

===Relief of Gibraltar===
In September 1782, Howe carried out the relief of Gibraltar – a difficult operation, 46 French and Spanish ships-of-the-line against only 33 of his own. The exhausted state of the fleet made it impossible for Howe to fit his ships properly or supply them with good crews, and Howe&#x27;s progress to Gibraltar was hampered by the need to escort a large convoy carrying stores. Howe successfully relieved Gibraltar and then fought an indecisive action at the Battle of Cape Spartel in October 1782 after which he was able to bring his fleet safely back to Britain, bringing an effective end to the naval campaign.

==First Lord of the Admiralty==
Howe became First Lord of the Admiralty in January 1783 during the Earl of Shelburne&#x27;s ministry, resigning in April 1783 when the Duke of Portland came to power and being re-appointed in December 1783 under the Younger Pitt&#x27;s first ministry. The task was often difficult, for he had to agree to extreme budgetary constraints and disappoint the hopes of many officers who were left unemployed by the peace. Nonetheless, during his time in office a number of new ships were built as part of a naval arms race with France and Spain. During his time at the Admiralty, Howe oversaw a number of innovations to signalling. Howe felt constantly undermined by Charles Middleton, the Comptroller of the Navy. Pitt often completely bypassed Howe on naval decisions and went directly to Middleton. By 1788 Howe grew tired of this and he resigned his post as First Lord despite efforts to persuade him to stay. To show their goodwill and approval of him, the government awarded Howe an Earldom on 22 July 1788.

==Spanish Armament==

In 1790 a dispute by Britain and Spain over the Nootka Sound on the Pacific coast of North America threatened to spark a war between the two states. Howe, as one of the most senior and experienced officers still serving, was offered command of the fleet in May 1790 and took up his post in Portsmouth in July 1790. Consisting of 35 ships-of-the-line the Channel Fleet put to sea and cruised for around a month to the west of Ushant before returning to port. The crisis was then settled peacefully by diplomats and Howe was able to return to his retirement on land. During a similar crisis with Russia in 1791 known as the Russian Armament Howe was not offered any command, probably because he was suffering from ill health.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
Following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Howe was again given command of the Channel Fleet in 1793. In command of a British fleet of twenty-two ships he defeated a fleet of twenty-five French ships, which had been escorting a grain convoy, capturing seven of the enemy ships, at the Glorious First of June in June 1794. For this victory he received the large Naval Gold Medal and chain. He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 12 March 1796.

==Later career==

In May 1797, Howe was called on to pacify Spithead mutineers: he spent twelve hours being rowed round the fleet and speaking to the men following which peace was restored. For this he was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Garter on 2 June 1797. Howe died at his home at 11 Grafton Street in London on 5 August 1799 and was buried in his family vault at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Langar in Nottinghamshire. His monument by John Flaxman is in the south aisle at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Places named after Howe include:
*Cape Howe, on the New South Wales / Victoria border, Australia;
*Torbay Head (the southernmost point of Western Australia), Torbay Inlet and Torbay, Western Australia, named after &quot;Lord Torbay&quot; (Lord Howe);
* West Cape Howe, near Torbay, Western Australia;
* Richard Island, in Torbay, Western Australia;
*Lord Howe Island, off the east coast of Australia;
*Howe Sound, British Columbia, Canada; and
*Howe Street, in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The King George V class battleship bore his name.

==Family==
On 10 March 1758 Howe married Mary Hartop; they had three daughters. His titles of Viscount and Earl Howe therefore became extinct with a lack of a male heir. His eldest daughter Sophia inherited the barony; she married twice, firstly to the Hon. Penn Assheton Curzon, son of Assheton Curzon, 1st Viscount Curzon, and his first wife Esther Hanmer, and secondly, in 1812, to Sir Jonathan Waller. She died on 3 December 1835 aged 73, and is buried in Holy Trinity Church, Penn, Buckinghamshire. Sophia&#x27;s eldest surviving son, Richard, was created Earl Howe in 1821.

<text>Ciudad Victoria () (English: &quot;Victoria City&quot;) is the seat of the Municipality of Victoria, and the capital of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. It is located in the northeast of Mexico at the foot of the Sierra Madre Oriental. It borders the municipality of Güémez to the north, Llera to the south, Casas Municipality to the east, and the municipality of Jaumave to the west. The city is located from Monterrey and from the US - Mexico border. Ciudad Victoria is named after the first president of Mexico, Guadalupe Victoria.

In 1825 Ciudad Victoria became the state capital. It is home to higher education institutions such as the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas and the Technological Institute of Ciudad Victoria. General Pedro José Méndez International Airport is located on the outskirts of the city. As a state bureaucratic centre, it is the seat of the three political powers and has sites of tourist and cultural interest.

== Pre-foundation ==

The Viceroy of New Spain, Juan Francisco Güémez and Horcasitas on Saturday, September 3, 1746, founded a colony in the &quot;Seno Mexicano&quot; (West coast of the Gulf of Mexico), dismembering the New Kingdom of León. Two years later, on Wednesday December 25, 1748, José de Escandon and Helguera founded Villa de Llera, part of the Late Colonization of New Santander, named after Santander, the capital of Cantabria, Spain. Villa de Santa María del Agua de Agüayo was founded on October 6, 1750.

==History==

Villa de Santa María de Aguayo was named after the wife of the first Count of Revillagigedo Don Juan Francisco de Güémez y Horcasitas, named Doña Antonia Cepherina Pacheco de Padilla, a native of Aguayo, Province of Santander, Spain.

The settlement was founded by José de Escandon and Helguera, Count of Sierra Gorda, during his second campaign of the Pacification and Colonization Plan of the coast of the Mexican Seno, later called New Santander, today Tamaulipas. The Spanish settlement open to the plain to the East and surrounded to the west by the Sierra Madre Oriental, a strategic location that also received breezes from the north and east. The town was administered by Captain D. Juan de Astigárraga, who drew up and carried out the first irrigation works. His work led to an increase in agriculture and, subsequently, a rapid rise in population.

In religious matters, the settlement was under the command of a Franciscan named Antonio Javier de Aréchaga, who was also in charge of the mission of San Felipe, which was founded with 150 indigenous people. That Catholic mission progressed more than those previously founded, because in the lands that were designated, they were opened by local Native Americans.

Captain Astigárraga died three years after the Villa de Agüayo was founded, and Escandon then conferred the appointment of captain to replace him in the command, Don Miguel de Córdoba.

Under the administration of the new captain, the Villa de Agüayo continued to progress, and when its statistics were formed in 1757, the settlement had in its farmhouse and estates located in its demarcation more than 1000 inhabitants who had 8600 heads of cattle and horses, and 4100 of smaller cattle.

The noble and military of Belgian descent, José de Craywinckel, when he visited the settlement, proposed to the Viceroy the reactivation of the Olazarán mine, which was abandoned in the Boca de Caballeros, since this measure would tend to give the settlement greater impetus in its prosperity, creating new interests and attracting new neighbours by this means, it being possible to expect that Villa de Aguayo would soon become one of the main populations of the new colony.

The nobleman also proposed to the Viceroy at that time, to undertake a campaign against rebellious Native Americans of the Síghue, who had their rancherías by the ravines and valleys of the Sierra Madre and in defines of their land harassed the shepherds and estates of the demarcation of Aguayo, arriving in his raids to join with the Janambre people in the attacks they undertook against the nearby Spanish settlements of Jaumave and Llera.

By this date some masonry houses were begun to be built in Aguayo, the materials for the construction of a Catholic church were gathered and large sugarcane plantations were established in the surrounding lands. The neighbourhood of this town also carried out the salt trade that was going to be collected from the saltworks of San Fernando and la Marina, with the villages of the interior of Charcas and the southern part of the New Kingdom of León.

The Spanish settlement of Villa de Aguayo was distributed in perfect grid form, and in its second settlement a few leagues east of its foundation, changing by the constant claim of the Native American tribes of Janambres and Pisones. The settlement was from the beginning the geographical central node communicating with all the settlements of New Santander.

As was the Spanish provision, land was designated for the construction of the Catholic Church, the Public Square, the seat of the Captaincy of the Civil - Military and Trade Authority, spaces that over time are known as the Historical Centre, formerly known as Plaza &quot;Hidalgo&quot;, &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot; or &quot;Plaza de Catedral&quot;. The settlement was dispersed and composed of 58 families with 409 people.

The river that crossed the settlement is the so-called San Marcos, which has an irrigation ditch, whose abundance of water gave the population all the irrigation it needs for the subsistence of its inhabitants, irrigation of plots and other sowing of corn, fostering also the cultivation of the cane. The quality of the land was adequate for all fruits typical of the region and facilitated the breeding and conservation of livestock.

Its location was one of the most advantageous in favour of the Royal Treasury, both for being the first transit of the colony, and because its crops and livestock promise great movement, evidencing its growth at the beginning of its founding, which was 11 families.

=== Colonial period ===

Unlike the modes of settlement that were commonly raised during the vice-regal period in New Spain, which followed a missionary and presidial structure, the new populations designed by José de Escandon had marked differences in the cultural, social, political and economic spheres.

The new populations that Escandon developed in the territory that is now known as Tamaulipas, called in the eighteenth-century New Santander, are based on ideas that have as a reference a way of exercising control over the development of the city and the territory, through its economic production. The direct consequences of this form of urban design marked in New Spain the opening to a new way of consolidating a border territory.

José de Escandon y Helguera, developed cattle ranching extensively and in a limited way agriculture, since for the most part &quot;temporary&quot; was practiced, and commerce also developed. The colonized territory was integrated and populated up to the Rio Grande, configuring the map of what is now Tamaulipas.

In addition, Escandon proposed the strategic location arrangements between each new population, a day away, which would facilitate that in cases of reoccurrence of attacks by the natives, could support each other. These are the characteristics that made the colonization of the New Santander transcendent; Although the reality did not always reflect the initial spirit of colonization, the model developed by José de Escandon proposed a new form of territorial occupation that had not been seen until the 18th century in New Spain.
=== Post-colonial period ===
After the Mexican Independence New Santander was renamed &quot;Tamaulipas&quot;, and the State Congress decrees on April 20, 1825, to elevate the Villa de Aguayo to the category of &quot;City&quot;, seat of the Three Powers and Capital of the State, approving the name of Victoria, in honour of the first President of Mexico, Guadalupe Victoria. &quot;The Capitality Decree, Title of City and Name&quot; is published by mandate of the First Congress, signed and sealed by Enrique Camilo Suárez, Vice Governor of Tamaulipas.

In this Capital, the Governor of the State, Lucas Fernández, on May 4 issued a decree to reject the invasion by order of the Spanish monarchy. The attempt of reconquest by the Spanish vanguard army commanded by General Brigadier Isidro Barradas, was frustrated on September 11, 1829, in Tampico, Tamaulipas; At the head of the national forces were the Generals: Felipe de la Garza Cisneros, Manuel Mier and Terán and Antonio López de Santa Anna. Battle of Tampico (1863) was one of the few battles against a foreign intervention in Mexico where the invaders have surrendered against the Mexican forces.

In 1846, in the Mexican–American War, Ciudad Victoria was occupied on December 25 by troops from the United States and was liberated at the end of the war. In 1898, President Porfirio Díaz sponsored the operation of the urban animal-drawn railroad that ran down Hidalgo Street to the Train Station, and a branch to the Hacienda de Tamatán, properties of Colonel Manuel González Jr. and that same year the Paseo Méndez was founded, inspired by Parisian street Champs-Élysées.

<text>Reynosa () is a border city in the northern part of the state of Tamaulipas, in Mexico which also holds the municipal seat of Reynosa Municipality.

The city is located on the southern bank of the Rio Grande in the international Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan area, directly across the Mexico–United States border from Hidalgo, Texas.

As of 2020, the city of Reynosa has a population of 691,557. If the floating population is included, the total can reach approximately 1,000,000.

==History==
On 6 July 1686, Agustín Echeverz y Zuvízar, governor of the &quot;Nuevo Reino de León,&quot; camped in what is now Reynosa during an exploratory expedition.

In December 1748, an expedition led by José de Escandón y Helguera left from Querétaro, planning to establish 14 villages; the caravan consisted of 1500 colonists and 755 soldiers.

On 14 March 1749, was founded (in its original location) the &quot;Villa de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Reynosa,&quot; by the captain Carlos Cantú on behalf of Escandón, being as well in political and military command. There were 279 pioneer residents in the charge of Friar Agustín Fragoso.

The city was named &quot;Reynosa&quot; after Reinosa, birthplace of the viceroy Juan Francisco de Güemes y Horcasitas.

In August 1750, the first flood was documented in the village.

In April 1757, Reynosa had it first political conflict, when Escandón dismissed Carlos Cantú as the mayor of the village, replacing him by Pedro de Estrada, second mayor of Reynosa.

On 9 July 1757, arrives to the village the captain José Tineda y Cuervo and the engineer Agustín López, both viceroyalty inspectors, to do a population census according to which Reynosa had 280 inhabitants.

As a result of the census, they obtained authorization from the King of Spain to move the village to a placed named Santa María de las Lajas, which was not done because Escandón didn&#x27;t consider the river a flooding risk anymore.

In September 1800, an immense flood occurred. The village was inundated and the villagers used canoes and rafts to arrive to the hills of &quot;El Morrillo.&quot; In 1802, the village moved to its current location and the new census showed 1631 inhabitants.

In 1810, the building of the old church &quot;Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe&quot; began, by the parish priest Don José Cárdenas; it was finished in 1815 by Don Lorenzo Treviño.

In 1846, Reynosa was invaded by the American army during the Mexican-American war. On 10 May 1910, General Lucio Blanco with the constitutional army took Reynosa during the Mexican revolution.

On 24 November 1926, Reynosa became a city.

===Current===
Reynosa extends across 3,156.34 sq kilometers (1218.66 sq. miles), representing 3.7 per cent of the Tamaulipas territory. Today it is the location of several satellite U.S. companies doing business to take advantage of low labor rates and industry incentives.

On 18 September 2012, an explosion at the nearby Pemex gas plant killed 30 and injured 46 people. Pemex Director Juan Jose Suarez said that there was &quot;no evidence that it was a deliberate incident, or some kind of attack&quot;.

In 2017, it was described as a major hotspot in the Mexican Drug War, as a result of the internecine wars between the Gulf and Los Zetas drugs cartels.

==Geography==
Reynosa is the largest and most populous city in the state of Tamaulipas, followed by Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Victoria, Tampico, and Río Bravo. In addition, the international Reynosa–McAllen Metropolitan Area has a population of 1,500,000 inhabitants, making it the third largest metropolitan area in the Mexico–U.S. border after San Diego–Tijuana and El Paso–Juárez. Reynosa is the 30th largest city in Mexico and anchors the largest metropolitan area in Tamaulipas.

In 2011, Reynosa was the fastest growing city in the state of Tamaulipas, and was among the top five fastest growing cities in Mexico.

The city is about south of McAllen, Texas.

===Climate===
Reynosa has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;) with short, mild winters and hot summers.
Winters are mild and dry with a January high of and a low of although temperatures can fall below . Summers are hot with a July mean of and temperatures can exceed anytime from May until August.

<doc id="224092" wikidata="Q695276" url="?curid=224092" title="Edward Boscawen">
<text>Admiral of the Blue Edward Boscawen, PC (19 August 171110 January 1761) was a British admiral in the Royal Navy and Member of Parliament for the borough of Truro, Cornwall, England. He is known principally for his various naval commands during the 18th century and the engagements that he won, including the siege of Louisburg in 1758 and Battle of Lagos in 1759. He is also remembered as the officer who signed the warrant authorising the execution of Admiral John Byng in 1757, for failing to engage the enemy at the Battle of Minorca (1756). In his political role, he served as a Member of Parliament for Truro from 1742 until his death in 1761 although, due to almost constant naval employment, he seems not to have been particularly active. He also served as one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the Board of Admiralty from 1751 and as a member of the Privy Council from 1758 until his death.

==Early life==
The Honourable Edward Boscawen was born in Tregothnan, Cornwall, England, on 19 August 1711, the third son of Hugh Boscawen, 1st Viscount Falmouth (1680–1734) by his wife Charlotte Godfrey (died 1754) elder daughter and co-heiress of Colonel Charles Godfrey, master of the jewel office by his wife Arabella Churchill, the King&#x27;s mistress, and sister of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.

The young Edward joined the navy at the age of 12 aboard of 60 guns. &quot;Superb&quot; was sent to the West Indies with Admiral Francis Hosier. Boscawen stayed with &quot;Superb&quot; for three years during the Anglo-Spanish War. He was subsequently reassigned to , , and under Admiral Sir Charles Wager and was aboard &quot;Namur&quot; when she sailed into Cadiz and Livorno following the Treaty of Seville that ended hostilities between Britain and Spain. On 25 May 1732 Boscawen was promoted lieutenant and in the August of the same year rejoined his old ship the 44-gun fourth-rate &quot;Hector&quot; in the Mediterranean. He remained with her until 16 October 1735 when he was promoted to the 70-gun . On 12 March 1736 Boscawen was promoted by Admiral Sir John Norris to the temporary command of the 50-gun . His promotion was confirmed by the Board of Admiralty. In June 1738 Boscawen was given command of , a small sixth-rate of 20 guns. He was ordered to accompany Admiral Edward Vernon to the West Indies in preparation for the oncoming war with Spain.

==War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear==
===Porto Bello===
The War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear proved to be Boscawen&#x27;s first opportunity for action and when &quot;Shoreham&quot; was declared unfit for service he volunteered to accompany Vernon and the fleet sent to attack Porto Bello.

During the siege, Boscawen was ordered with Sir Charles Knowles to destroy the forts. The task took three weeks and 122 barrels of gunpowder to accomplish but the British levelled the forts surrounding the town. Vernon&#x27;s achievement was hailed in Britain as an outstanding feat of arms and in the furore that surrounded the announcement the patriotic song &quot;Rule, Britannia&quot; was played for the first time. Streets were named after Porto Bello throughout Britain and its colonies. When the fleet returned to Port Royal, Jamaica &quot;Shoreham&quot; had been refitted and Boscawen resumed command of her.

===Cartagena===

In 1741 Boscawen was part of the fleet sent to attack another Caribbean port, Cartagena de Indias. Large reinforcements had been sent from Britain, including 8,000 soldiers who were landed to attack the chain of fortresses surrounding the Spanish colonial city. The Spanish had roughly 6,000 troops made up of regular soldiers, sailors and local loyalist natives. The siege lasted for over two months during which period the British troops suffered over 18,000 casualties, the vast majority from disease. Vernon&#x27;s fleet suffered from dysentery, scurvy, yellow fever and other illnesses that were widespread throughout the Caribbean during the period. As a result of the battle Prime Minister Robert Walpole&#x27;s government collapsed and George II removed his promise of support to the Austrians if the Prussians advanced into Silesia. The defeat of Vernon was a contributing factor to the increased hostilities of the War of the Austrian Succession. Boscawen had however distinguished himself once more. The land forces that he commanded had been instrumental in capturing Fort San Luis and Boca Chica Castle, and together with Knowles he destroyed the captured forts when the siege was abandoned. For his services he was promoted in May 1742 to the rank of captain and appointed to command the 70-gun &quot;Prince Frederick&quot; to replace Lord Aubrey Beauclerk who had died during the siege.

==War of the Austrian Succession==

In 1742 Boscawen returned in &quot;Prince Frederick&quot; to England, where she was paid off and Boscawen joined the fleet commanded by Admiral Norris in the newly built 60-gun . In the same year he was returned as a Member of Parliament for Truro, a position he held until his death. At the 1747 general election he was also returned for Saltash, but chose to continue to sit for Truro.

In 1744 the French attempted an invasion of England and Boscawen was with the fleet under Admiral Norris when the French fleet were sighted. The French under Admiral Rocquefeuil retreated and the British attempts to engage were confounded by a violent storm that swept the English Channel.

Whilst cruising the Channel, Boscawen had the good fortune to capture the French frigate . She was the first capture of an enemy ship made during the War of Austrian Succession and was commanded by M. de Hocquart. &quot;Médée&quot; was sold and became a successful privateer under her new name &quot;Boscawen&quot; commanded by George Walker.

At the end of 1744 Boscawen was given command of , guard ship at the Nore anchorage. He commanded her until 1745 when he was appointed to another of his old ships, HMS &quot;Namur&quot;, that had been reduced (razéed) from 90 guns to 74 guns. He was appointed to command a small squadron under Vice-Admiral Martin in the Channel.

===First Battle of Cape Finisterre===

In 1747 Boscawen was ordered to join Admiral Anson and took an active part in the first Battle of Cape Finisterre. The British fleet sighted the French fleet on 3 May. The French fleet under Admiral de la Jonquière was convoying its merchant fleet to France and the British attacked. The French fleet was almost completely annihilated with all but two of the escorts taken and six merchantmen. Boscawen was injured in the shoulder during the battle by a musket ball. Once more the French captain, M. de Hocquart became Boscawen&#x27;s prisoner and was taken to England.

===Command in India===
Boscawen was promoted rear-admiral of the blue on 15 July 1747 and was appointed to command a joint operation being sent to the East Indies. With his flag in &quot;Namur&quot;, and with five other line of battle ships, a few smaller men of war, and a number of transports Boscawen sailed from England on 4 November 1747. On the outward voyage Boscawen made an abortive attempt to capture Mauritius by surprise but was driven off by French forces. Boscawen continued on arriving at Fort St. David near the town of Cuddalore on 29 July 1748 and took over command from Admiral Griffin. Boscawen had been ordered to capture and destroy the main French settlement in India at Pondichéry. Factors such as Boscawen&#x27;s lack of knowledge and experience of land offensives, the failings of the engineers and artillery officers under his command, a lack of secrecy surrounding the operation and the skill of the French governor Joseph François Dupleix combined to thwart the attack. The British forces amounting to some 5,000 men captured and destroyed the outlying fort of Aranciopang. This capture was the only success of the operation and after failing to breach the walls of the city the British forces withdrew. Amongst the combatants were a young ensign Robert Clive, later known as Clive of India and Major Stringer Lawrence, later Commander-in-Chief, India. Lawrence was captured by the French during the retreat and exchanged after the news of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had reached India. Over the monsoon season Boscawen remained at Fort St David. Fortunately, for the Admiral and his staff, when a storm hit the British outpost Boscawen was ashore but his flagship &quot;Namur&quot; went down with over 600 men aboard.

Boscawen returned to England in 1750. In 1751 Anson became First Lord of the Admiralty and asked Boscawen to serve on the Admiralty Board. Boscawen remained one of the Lord Commissioners of the Admiralty until his death.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==


On 4 February 1755 Boscawen was promoted vice admiral and given command of a squadron on the North American Station. A squadron of partially disarmed French ships of the line were dispatched to Canada loaded with reinforcements and Boscawen was ordered to intercept them. The French ambassador to London, the Duc de Mirepoix had informed the government of George II that any act of hostility taken by British ships would be considered an act of war. Thick fog both obstructed Boscawen&#x27;s reconnaissance and scattered the French ships, but on 8 June Boscawen&#x27;s squadron sighted the &quot;Alcide&quot;, &quot;Lys&quot; and &quot;Dauphin Royal&quot; off Cape Ray off Newfoundland. In the ensuing engagement the British captured the &quot;Alcide&quot; and &quot;Lys&quot; but the &quot;Dauphin Royal&quot; escaped into the fog. Amongst the 1,500 men made prisoner was the captain of the &quot;Alcide&quot;. For M. de Hocquart it was the third time that Boscawen had fought him and taken his ship. Pay amounting to £80,000 was captured aboard the &quot;Lys&quot;. Boscawen, as vice-admiral commanding the squadron, would have been entitled to a sizeable share in the prize money. The British squadron headed for Halifax to regroup but a fever spread through the ships and the Vice-admiral was forced to return to England.

Boscawen returned to the Channel Fleet and was commander-in-chief Portsmouth during the trial of Admiral John Byng. Boscawen signed the order of execution after the King had refused to grant the unfortunate admiral a pardon. Boscawen was advanced to Senior Naval Lord on the Admiralty Board in November 1756 but then stood down (as Senior Naval Lord although he remained on the Board) in April 1757, during the caretaker ministry, before being advanced to Senior Naval Lord again in July 1757.

===Siege of Louisburg===

In October 1757 Boscawen was second in command under Admiral Edward Hawke. On 7 February 1758 Boscawen was promoted to Admiral of the blue squadron. and ordered to take a fleet to North America. Once there, he took naval command at the siege of Louisburg during June and July 1758. On this occasion rather than entrust the land assault to a naval commander, the army was placed under the command of General Jeffrey Amherst and Brigadier James Wolfe. The siege of Louisburg was one of the key contributors to the capture of French possessions in Canada. Wolfe later would use Louisburg as a staging point for the siege of Quebec. The capture of the town deprived the French of the only effective naval base that they had in Canada, as well as leading to the destruction of four of their ships of the line and the capture of another. On his return from North America Boscawen was awarded the Thanks of both Houses of Parliament for his service. The King made Boscawen a Privy Counsellor in recognition for his continued service both as a member of the Board of Admiralty and commander-in-chief.

===Battle of Lagos===

In April 1759 Boscawen took command of a fleet bound for the Mediterranean. His aim was to prevent another planned invasion of Britain by the French. With his flag aboard the newly constructed of 90 guns he blockaded Toulon and kept the fleet of Admiral de le Clue-Sabran in port. In order to tempt the French out of port, Boscawen sent three of his ships to bombard the port. The guns of the batteries surrounding the town drove off the British ships. Having sustained damage in the action and due to the constant weathering of ships on blockade duty Boscawen took his fleet to Gibraltar to refit and resupply. On 17 August a frigate that had been ordered to watch the Straits of Gibraltar signalled that the French fleet were in sight. Boscawen took his available ships to sea to engage de la Clue. During the night the British chased the French fleet and five of de la Clue&#x27;s ships managed to separate from the fleet and escape. The others were driven in to a bay near Lagos, Portugal. The British overhauled the remaining seven ships of the French fleet and engaged. The French line of battle ship began a duel with &quot;Namur&quot; but was outgunned and struck her colours. The damage aboard &quot;Namur&quot; forced Boscawen to shift his flag to of 80 guns. Whilst transferring between ships, the small boat that Boscawen was in was hit by an enemy cannonball. Boscawen took off his wig and plugged the hole. Two more French ships, and escaped during the second night and on the morning of 19 August the British captured and and drove the French flagship and ashore where they foundered and were set on fire by their crews to stop the British from taking them off and repairing them. The five French ships that avoided the battle made their way to Cadiz where Boscawen ordered Admiral Thomas Broderick to blockade the port.

==Final years, death, and legacy==
Boscawen returned to England, where he was promoted General of Marines in recognition of his service. He was given the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh. Admiral Boscawen returned to sea for the final time and took his station off the west coast of France around Quiberon Bay. After a violent attack of what was later diagnosed as Typhoid fever, the Admiral came ashore, where, on 10 January 1761, he died at his home in Hatchlands Park in Surrey. His body was taken to St. Michael&#x27;s Church in St Michael Penkevil, Cornwall, where he was buried. The monument was designed by Robert Adam and sculpted by John Michael Rysbrack. The monument at the church begins:

Here lies the Right Honourable&lt;br&gt;Edward Boscawen,&lt;br&gt;Admiral of the Blue, General of Marines,&lt;br&gt;Lord of the Admiralty, and one of his&lt;br&gt;Majesty&#x27;s most Honourable Privy Council.&lt;br&gt;His birth, though noble,&lt;br&gt;His titles, though illustrious,&lt;br&gt;Were but incidental additions to his greatness.

William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham and Prime Minister once said to Boscawen: &quot;When I apply to other Officers respecting any expedition I may chance to project, they always raise difficulties, you always find expedients.&quot;

===Legacy===
The town of Boscawen, New Hampshire is named after him. Two ships and a stone frigate of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS &quot;Boscawen&quot;, after Admiral Boscawen, whilst another ship was planned but the plans were shelved before she was commissioned. The stone frigate was a training base for naval cadets and in consequence three ships were renamed HMS &quot;Boscawen&quot; whilst being used as the home base for the training establishment.

===Quotes===
Boscawen was quoted as saying &quot;To be sure I lose the fruits of the earth, but then, I am gathering the flowers of the Sea&quot; (1756) and &quot;Never fire, my lads, till you see the whites of the Frenchmen&#x27;s eyes.&quot;

==Frances Evelyn Boscawen==
In 1742 Boscawen married Frances Evelyn Glanville (1719–1805), with whom he had three sons and two daughters, and who became an important hostess of Bluestocking meetings after his death. The older daughter Frances married John Leveson-Gower, and the younger, Elizabeth married Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort.

<text>Tampico is a city and port in the southeastern part of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. It is located on the north bank of the Pánuco River, about inland from the Gulf of Mexico, and directly north of the state of Veracruz. Tampico is the fifth-largest city in Tamaulipas, with a population of 314,418 in the city proper and 929,174 in the metropolitan area.

During the period of Mexico&#x27;s first oil boom in the early 20th century, the city was the &quot;chief oil-exporting port of the Americas&quot; and the second-busiest in the world, yielding great profits that were invested in the city&#x27;s famous architecture, often compared to that of Venice and New Orleans. The first oil well in Mexico was drilled near Tampico in 1901 at Ébano.

The city is also a major exporter of silver, copper, and lumber, as well as wool, hemp, and other agricultural products. Containerized cargo is mainly handled by the neighboring ocean port of Altamira.

==History==

The name &quot;Tampico&quot; is of Huastec origin, &quot;tam-piko&quot; meaning &quot;place of otters&quot; (literally &quot;water dogs&quot;). The city is surrounded by rivers and lagoons of the delta of the Pánuco River, which was the habitat of a large population of otters. There have been successive human settlements in the area for centuries. The region had several early Huastec settlements, among them the important site at Las Flores, which flourished between AD 1000 and 1250.

In 1532, during the Spanish colonial period, the Franciscan priest Andrés de Olmos established a mission and monastery in the area, building over a former Huastec village. At his request, Spanish officials founded a settlement named San Luis de Tampico in 1554. This site was abandoned in 1684, and the population relocated to the south of the Pánuco River because of frequent attacks by pirates. The area was abandoned for nearly 150 years.

The present city was founded on April 13, 1823, on the north bank of the Pánuco River about from the Gulf, after Mexico achieved independence from Spain. Tampico built its economy on the exportation of silver; business development was mostly as a trading center and market town of an agricultural region. In August 1829, Spain sent troops from Cuba to invade Tampico in an effort to regain control of the region, but in September, General Antonio López de Santa Anna forced the Spanish troops to surrender, and Mexican control of Tampico was reestablished.

===20th century to present===
The first oil well in Mexico was drilled near Tampico at Ébano, S.L.P., in 1901, by Californian Edward Doheny, who founded the Mexican Petroleum Corporation. In the early 20th century, there was extensive U.S. investment in oil development in Tampico, with a sizable United States expatriate community developing in relation to the industry. With the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, which lasted roughly from 1910 to 1920, the U.S. monitored the situation to protect its citizens and investments. Doheny sold some of his businesses to the Standard Oil Company which operated its monopoly here. The oil-producing area was so productive it was called the &quot;Golden Belt&quot;.

The oil fields known as Ébano, Pánuco, Huasteca, and Tuxpan are all situated within a radius of the city. Oil was often shipped on barges along the rivers. To improve transportation of oil to the port, the government built the Chijol Canal, beginning in 1901. It is deep and wide and runs southward through the oil fields to Tuxpan.

During the Mexican Revolution, on April 9, 1914, 10 Mexican soldiers and nine U.S. Navy sailors from the USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; confronted each other in a failure to communicate as U.S. forces tried to get fuel supplies. General Victoriano Huerta&#x27;s forces in the city were threatened by different groups from both north and south. The Americans were arrested and later freed, but the U.S. resented Huerta&#x27;s demands for some recognition. In the resulting Tampico Affair, the U.S. sent naval and marine forces into port of Veracruz and occupied the city for seven months in a show of force. Due to resulting anti-American demonstrations on each coast, other U.S. Navy ships were used to evacuate some American citizens to refugee camps in southern U.S. cities. The U.S. occupation contributed to the downfall of Huerta, and Venustiano Carranza became president. He ensured that Mexico maintained neutrality during World War I, in part due to lingering animosity against the U.S. for these actions.

In the 1970s, Tampico annexed the port city and suburb of Ciudad Madero, which now comprises part of the Tampico metropolitan area. Tampico has a modern port with excellent facilities, as well as rail and air connections to Mexico City and the United States.

The Mexican government nationalized the oil industry in 1938 and has maintained that for 86 years. In November 2014, President Enrique Peña Nieto announced a policy change of ending Pemex&#x27;s monopoly and inviting private companies back into the oil and gas industry. While analysts believe the largest finds are likely to be offshore, new techniques may yield oil even at mature fields such as those of Tampico. In early 2015, the government planned to accept bids on 169 blocks, 47 of which are within of Tampico. It is expected that smaller companies will be active in the mature fields, such as those in this region. This area has extensive shale oil deposits, and the &quot;U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that Mexico has the world&#x27;s eighth-largest shale-oil resources.&quot;

==Architecture==

Tampico&#x27;s downtown architecture is an eclectic mix, reflecting the growth of the city during the &quot;Porfiriato&quot; (the period of rule by President Porfirio Díaz). During the oil boom of the first decades of the 20th century, much &quot;grandiose&quot; architecture was built, inviting comparisons with Venice, Italy, and New Orleans in the United States. Many buildings feature wrought-iron balconies (in the 20th century, these were mostly built of English cast iron). Similar balconies are characteristic of the French and Spanish-influenced architecture in New Orleans. Some of the balconies in &quot;Plaza de la libertad&quot; bear the original plaques showing their manufacture at the Derbyshire forge of Andrew Handyside and Company.

Notable buildings include the neoclassical Town Hall (or &quot;Palacio Municipal&quot;) in &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot;, and the English redbrick Customs House in the docks. The prevalence of New Orleans-style architecture is attributed to the oil boom years. Not only was there money to spend, but many building supplies, including pre-built housing components, were shipped from New Orleans to this area during that period of rapid development. The historical downtown areas of &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot; and &quot;Plaza de Libertad&quot; have been restored and improved in recent years to emphasize their historic appeal, in part to encourage more heritage tourism.

The Cathedral of Tampico, also known as the Temple of the Immaculate Conception, located in &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot;, dates to the late 19th century. It has undergone several restorations. It is of the neoclassical style in light brown canter, with Corinthian-style columns and three enormous doors that form the entrance. Its two towers are made of three bodies. The eastern one has a large, London-made, public chiming clock, a gift from Don Angel Sainz Trapaga. Its recently refurbished interior holds several wall paintings and other works of art. The altar is of white Carrara marble. The United States oil tycoon Edward Doheny of California, who drilled the first oil well in Mexico near Tampico, donated substantial funds for the cathedral&#x27;s construction and maintenance after 1902, when he based his Mexican oil operations in Tampico.

==Demographics==
According to the INEGI 2010 census, the population of the city of Tampico was 297,284, and that of the municipality of Tampico was 297,554, both ranking fifth in the state of Tamaulipas. The population of the Tampico—Ciudad Madero—Altamira metropolitan area was estimated at 859,419 people in 2010. The municipality has an area of .
==Geography==
The city is located on the north bank of the Pánuco River, about inland from the Gulf of Mexico, and directly north of the state of Veracruz.
===Climate===

Tampico has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;), defined as such based on the mean average temperature of 18 °C (65 °F) for January as well as on precipitation patterns. Its weather, though relatively mild in spring and autumn, is hot in the summer; the average high reaches 32 °C (90 °F) in August, with an average low of 23 °C (74 °F). Winters are warm; the average January high is 23 °C (73 °F) and the average low in January is 13 °C (58 °F). Rainfall is frequent from June through October.

Tampico is an extremely humid city, with summer heat indices reaching 40 °C (104 °F). It is located on the Pánuco River and among extensive wetlands adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. During autumn and winter, it is affected by cold fronts that pass through the gulf and bring high winds that can reach 50 km/h (37 mph) with gusts of 70 to 80 km/h (43 to 50 mph). Tampico is also located in a hurricane area, but it has not been directly affected by one since October 1966.

On rare occasions, the city experiences surprisingly low temperatures for its zone; during late January and early February 2011, a cold wave caused temperatures to drop to , with the lowest being in the morning and noon of 4 February. In February 1895, snow was reported to have fallen in Tampico. This is the North American record for the farthest south report of snow at a coastal location, and makes Tampico one of the few places where snow has fallen in the tropics at sea level.

==Transportation==

The metropolitan area of Tampico, Ciudad Madero, and Altamira is served by General Francisco Javier Mina International Airport (IATA airport code: TAM), which is located in the northern part of the city of Tampico. It serves routes to Mexican cities, mainly Mexico City and Monterrey, and also has international services, with daily flights to Houston, Texas.

The city also has excellent railway facilities serving the port, which is well-developed with warehouses and equipment for loading oil tankers. Major roads connect to the Pan-American Highway.

==Food==
Tampico is known for its food. Seafood is important in the city. The locals are informally known as &quot;Jaibas&quot; (crabs), and the crab emblem is seen in many places, from sports logos to the sides of buses to park benches. There are also typical dishes of the area, mainly the &quot;torta de la barda&quot; which is a sandwich that contains over 12 toppings, and the famous &quot;tampiqueña&quot; which is steak with refried beans and &quot;entomatadas&quot; (tortillas with tomato sauce and cheese).

==Education==
The Autonomous University of Tamaulipas has one of its two largest campuses in Tampico, the other being in Ciudad Victoria. The major schools of medicine, engineering, nursing, dentistry, architecture, and business are based here.

Multiple high schools, both private and public, are located in Tampico.

==Sports==

The local professional football team, Tampico Madero F.C., was founded in 1945 and is also known as &quot;La Jaiba Brava&quot;. They currently play in the Ascenso MX, the second tier of the Mexican football league system, and their home stadium has been the 19,415-seat Estadio Tamaulipas since 1966.

In 1953, Tampico Madero was champion of the México Primera División and also won the Campeón de Campeones title. &quot;La Jaiba Brava&quot; won consecutive Copa México titles in 1960 and 1961. The club spent most of the 1960s and 1970s in relegation but returned to the Primera División for the 1977–78 season. They finished runner-up twice in the shortened 1985 and 1986 Primera División tournaments under Chilean manager Carlos Reinoso before being relegated again in the early 1990s.

<text>The Adbusters Media Foundation is a Canadian-based not-for-profit, pro-environment organization founded in 1989 by Kalle Lasn and Bill Schmalz in Vancouver, British Columbia. Adbusters describes itself as &quot;a global network of artists, activists, writers, pranksters, students, educators and entrepreneurs who want to advance the new social activist movement of the information age.&quot;

As anti-capitalist or opposed to capitalism, it publishes the reader-supported, advertising-free &quot;Adbusters&quot;, an activist magazine devoted to challenging consumerism. The magazine has an international circulation peaking at 120,000 in the late 2000s with circulation of 60,000 in 2022. Past and present contributors to the magazine include Jonathan Barnbrook, Morris Berman, Brendan Connell, Simon Critchley, David Graeber, Michael Hardt, Chris Hedges, Bill McKibben, Jim Munroe, David Orrell, Douglas Rushkoff, Matt Taibbi, Slavoj Žižek, and others.

Adbusters has launched numerous international campaigns, including Buy Nothing Day, TV Turnoff Week and Occupy Wall Street, and is known for their &quot;subvertisements&quot; that spoof popular advertisements. In English, Adbusters has bi-monthly American, Canadian, Australian, UK and International editions of each issue. Adbusters&#x27;s sister organizations include &quot;Résistance à l&#x27;Aggression Publicitaire&quot; and &quot;Casseurs de Pub&quot; in France, &quot;Adbusters Norge&quot; in Norway, &quot;Adbusters Sverige&quot; in Sweden and &quot;Culture Jammers&quot; in Japan.

==History==
Adbusters was founded in 1989 by Kalle Lasn and Bill Schmalz, a duo of award-winning documentary filmmakers living in Vancouver. Since the early 1980s, Lasn had been making films that explored the spiritual and cultural lessons the West could learn from the Japanese experience with capitalism.

In 1988, the &quot;British Columbia Council of Forest Industries,&quot; the &quot;voice&quot; of the logging industry, was facing tremendous public pressure from a growing environmentalist movement. The logging industry fought back with a television ad campaign called &quot;Forests Forever.&quot; It was an early example of greenwashing: shots of happy children, workers and animals with a kindly, trustworthy sounding narrator who assured the public that the logging industry was protecting the forest.

Lasn and Shmalz, outraged by the use of the public airwaves to deliver what they felt was deceptive anti-environmentalist propaganda, responded by producing the &quot;Talking Rainforest&quot; anti-ad in which an old-growth tree explains to a sapling that &quot;a tree farm is not a forest.&quot; But the duo proved to be unable to buy airtime on the same stations that had aired the forest-industry ad. According to a former Adbusters employee, &quot;The CBC&#x27;s reaction to the proposed television commercial created the real flash point for the Media Foundation. It seemed that Lasn and Schmaltz&#x27;s commercial was too controversial to air on the CBC. An environmental message that challenged the large forestry companies was considered &#x27;advocacy advertising&#x27; and was disallowed, even though the &#x27;informational&#x27; messages that glorified clearcutting were OK.&quot;

The foundation was born out of their belief that citizens do not have the same access to the information flows as corporations. One of the foundation&#x27;s key campaigns continues to be the Media Carta, a &quot;movement to enshrine The Right to Communicate in the constitutions of all free nations, and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&quot;

The foundation notes that concern over the flow of information goes beyond the desire to protect democratic transparency, freedom of speech or the public&#x27;s access to the airwaves. Although it supports these causes, the foundation instead situates the battle of the mind at the center of its political agenda. Fighting to counter pro-consumerist advertising is done not as a means to an end, but as the end in itself. This shift in emphasis is a crucial element of mental environmentalism.

==Mental environmentalism==
The subtitle of &quot;Adbusters&quot; magazine is &quot;The Journal of the Mental Environment.&quot;

In a 1996 interview, Kalle Lasn explained the foundation&#x27;s goal:
What we&#x27;re trying to do is pioneer a new form of social activism using all the power of the mass media to sell ideas, rather than products. We&#x27;re motivated by a kind of &#x27;greenthink&#x27; that comes from the environmental movement and isn&#x27;t mired in the old ideology of the left and right. Instead, we take the environmental ethic into the mental ethic, trying to clean up the toxic areas of our minds.

You can&#x27;t recycle and be a good environmental citizen, then watch four hours of television and get consumption messages pumped at you.

==Issues==

===Anti-advertising===
Adbusters describes itself as anti-advertising: it blames advertising for playing a central role in creating and maintaining consumer culture. This argument is based on the premise that the advertising industry goes to great effort and expense to associate desire and identity with commodities. Adbusters believes that advertising has unjustly &quot;colonized&quot; public, discursive and psychic spaces, by appearing in movies, sports and even schools, so as to permeate modern culture. Adbusters&#x27;s stated goals include combating the negative effects of advertising and empowering its readers to regain control of culture, encouraging them to ask &quot;Are we consumers and citizens?&quot;

Since &quot;Adbusters&quot; concludes that advertising conditions people to look to external sources, to define their own personal identities, the magazine advocates a &quot;natural and authentic self apart from the consumer society&quot;. The magazine aims to provoke anti-consumerist feelings. By juxtaposing text and images, the magazine attempts to create a means of raising awareness and getting its message out to people that is both aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.

Activism also takes many other forms such as corporate boycotts and &#x27;art as protest&#x27;, often incorporating humor. This includes billboard modifications, google bombing, flash mobs and fake parking tickets for SUVs. A popular example of cultural jamming is the distortion of Tiger Woods&#x27; smile into the form of the Nike swoosh, calling viewers to question how they view Woods&#x27; persona as a product. &quot;Adbusters&quot; calls it &quot;trickle up&quot; activism, and encourages its readers to do these activities by honoring culture jamming work in the magazine. In the September/October 2001 &quot;Graphic Anarchy&quot; issue, Adbusters were culture jammed themselves in a manner of speaking: they hailed the work of Swiss graphic designer Ernst Bettler as &quot;one of the greatest design interventions on record&quot;, unaware that Bettler&#x27;s story was an elaborate hoax.

===Media Carta===
&quot;Media Carta&quot; is a charter challenging the corporate control of the public airwaves and means of communication. The goal is to &quot;make the public airwaves truly public, and not just a corporate domain.&quot; Over 30,000 people have signed the document voicing their desire to reclaim the public space.
On 13 September 2004, Adbusters filed a lawsuit against six major Canadian television broadcasters (including CanWest Global, Bell Globemedia, CHUM Ltd., and the CBC) for refusing to air Adbusters videos in the television commercial spots that Adbusters attempted to purchase. Most broadcasters refused the commercials, fearing the ads would upset other advertisers as well as violate business principles by &quot;contaminating the purity of media environments designed exclusively for communicating commercial messages&quot;. The lawsuit claims that Adbusters&#x27; freedom of expression was unjustly limited by the refusals. Adbusters believes the public deserves a right to be presented with viewpoints that differ from the standard. Under Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, television is a public space allowing ordinary citizens to possess the same rights as advertising agencies and corporations to purchase 30 seconds of airtime from major broadcasters. There has been talk that if Adbusters wins in Canadian court, they will file similar lawsuits against major U.S. broadcasters that also refused the advertisements. CNN is the only network that has allowed several of the foundation&#x27;s commercials to run.

===Legal action===
On 3 April 2009, the British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously overturned a BC Supreme Court ruling that had dismissed the case in February 2008. The court granted Adbusters the ability to sue the Canadian Broadcasting Company and CanWest Global, the corporations that originally refused to air the anti-car ad &quot;Autosaurus&quot;. The ruling represents a victory for Adbusters, but it is the first step of their intended goal, essentially opening the door for future legal action against the media conglomerates. Kalle Lasn declared the ruling a success and said, &quot;After twenty years of legal struggle, the courts have finally given us permission to take on the media corporations and hold them up to public scrutiny.&quot;

==Campaigns==
===Culture jamming===

Culture jamming is the primary means through which Adbusters challenges consumerism. The magazine was described by Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter in their book &quot;The Rebel Sell&quot; as &quot;the flagship publication of the culture jamming movement.&quot; Culture jamming is heavily influenced by the Situationist International and the tactic of &quot;détournement&quot;. The goal is to interrupt the normal consumerist experience in order to reveal the underlying ideology of an advertisement, media message, or consumer artifact. Adbusters believe large corporations control mainstream media and the flow of information, and culture jamming aims to challenge this as a form of protest. The term &quot;jam&quot; contains more than one meaning, including improvising, by re-situating an image or idea already in existence, and interrupting, by attempting to stop the workings of a machine.

As already noted, the foundation&#x27;s approach to culture jamming has its roots in the activities of the situationists and in particular their concept of &quot;détournement&quot;. This involves the &quot;turning around&quot; of received messages so that they communicate meanings at variance with their original intention. Situationists argue that consumerism creates &quot;a limitless artificiality&quot;, blurring the lines of reality and detracting from the essence of human experience. In the &quot;culture jamming&quot; context, &quot;détournement&quot; means taking symbols, logos and slogans that are considered to be the vehicles upon which the &quot;dominant discourse&quot; of &quot;late capitalism&quot; is communicated and changing them – frequently in significant but minor ways – to subvert the &quot;monologue of the ruling order&quot; [Debord].

The foundation&#x27;s activism links grassroots efforts with environmental and social concerns, hoping followers will &quot;reconstruct [their] self through nonconsumption strategies.&quot; The foundation is particularly well known for its culture jamming campaigns, and the magazine often features photographs of politically motivated billboard or advertisement vandalism sent in by readers. The campaigns attempt to remove people from the &quot;isolated reality of consumer comforts&quot;.

===Blackspot Shoes campaign===
In 2004, the foundation began selling vegan, indie shoes. The name and logo are &quot;open-source&quot;; in other words, unencumbered by private trademarks. Attached to each pair was a &quot;Rethink the Cool&quot; leaflet, inviting wearers to join a movement, and two spots – one for drawing their own logos and another on the toe for &quot;kicking corporate ass.&quot;

There are three versions of the Blackspot Sneaker. The V1 is designed to resemble the Nike-owned Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars (Nike bought Converse in 2003). There is also a V1 in &quot;fiery red.&quot;

The V2 is designed by Canadian shoe designer John Fluevog. It is made from organic hemp and recycled car tires.

After an extensive search for anti-sweatshop manufacturers around the world, Adbusters found a small union shop in Portugal. The sale of more than twenty-five thousand pairs through an alternative distribution network is an example of Western consumer activism marketing.

Adbusters describes its goals vis-à-vis Blackspot as follows:

====Reception====
Heath and Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Rebel Sell&quot;, which is critical of Adbusters, claimed that the blackspot shoe&#x27;s existence proves that &quot;no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between &#x27;mainstream&#x27; and &#x27;alternative&#x27; culture.&quot;

In the June 2008 cover story of &quot;BusinessWeek Small Business Magazine&quot;, the Blackspot campaign was among three profiled in a piece focusing on &quot;antipreneurs.&quot; Two advertising executives were asked to review the campaign for the article&#x27;s &quot;Ask the Experts&quot; sidebar. Brian Martin of &quot;Brand Connections&quot; and Dave Weaver of TM Advertising both gave the campaign favorable reviews.

Martin noted that Blackspot was effectively telling consumers, &quot;We know we are marketing to you, and you are as good as we are at this, and your opinion matters,&quot; while Weaver stated that &quot;This is not a call to sales of the shoe so much as it is a call to participate in the community of Adbusters by buying the shoe.&quot;

===Occupy Wall Street===
In mid-2011, Adbusters Foundation proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent global financial crisis. They sought to combine the symbolic location of the 2011 protests in Tahrir Square with the consensus decision making of the 2011 Spanish protests. Adbusters&#x27; senior editor Micah White said they had suggested the protest via their email list and it &quot;was spontaneously taken up by all the people of the world.&quot; Adbusters&#x27; website said that from their &quot;one simple demand—a presidential commission to separate money from politics&quot; they would &quot;start setting the agenda for a new America.&quot; They promoted the protest with a poster featuring a dancer atop Wall Street&#x27;s iconic Charging Bull. On 13 July 2011 it was the staff at the magazine that created the #OCCUPYWALLSTREET hashtag on Twitter.

While the movement was started by Adbusters, the group does not control the movement, and it has since grown worldwide.

==Criticisms==

===Criminal Mischief===
The foundation has been criticized for solicitating dangerous criminal mischief by escalating their methods to deflate &quot;SUV tires in an effort to fight climate change.&quot;

===Commercial style===
The foundation has been criticized for having a style and form that are too similar to the media and commercial product that Adbusters attack, that its high gloss design makes the magazine too expensive, and that a style over substance approach is used to mask sub-par content.

Heath and Potter posit that the more alternative or subversive the foundation feels, the more appealing the Blackspot sneaker will become to the mainstream market. They believe consumers seek exclusivity and social distinction and have argued that the mainstream market seeks the very same brand of individuality that the foundation promotes; thus they see the foundation as promoting capitalist values.

The Blackspot Shoes campaign has stirred heated debate, as Adbusters admits to using the same marketing technique which it denounces other companies for using by originally purchasing much advertising space for the shoe.

===Legal issues===
Adbusters launched a legal challenge in 1995. A second in 2004 was against CBC, CTV, CanWest and CHUM, for refusing to air anti-consumerism commercials, therefore infringing on the staff&#x27;s freedom of speech. In one case, a CHUM representative is quoted as saying the ads &quot;were so blatantly against television and that is our entire core business. You know we can&#x27;t be selling our airtime and then telling people to turn their TVs off.&quot;

===Alleged antisemitism===

In March 2004, &quot;Adbusters&quot; was accused of antisemitism after running an article titled &quot;Why won&#x27;t anyone say they are Jewish?&quot; The article compiled a list of neoconservative supporters within the Bush administration and marked the names of those it believed to be Jewish with a black dot. It questioned why, given Israel&#x27;s role, the political implications of this Jewish neoconservative influence on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East were not a subject of debate.

In October 2010, Shopper&#x27;s Drug Mart pulled &quot;Adbusters&quot; off of its shelves after a photo montage comparing the Gaza Strip to the Warsaw ghetto was featured in an article criticizing Israel&#x27;s embargo of Gaza. The Canadian Jewish Congress campaigned to have the magazine blacklisted from bookstores, accusing &quot;Adbusters&quot; of trivializing the Holocaust and of antisemitism. In response, &quot;Adbusters&quot; argued that the charge of antisemitism was being used to silence what it considered legitimate criticism of Israeli policies.

===Ineffective activism===
Some critics claim that culture jamming does little to incite real difference. Others declare the movement an easy way for upper- and middle-class citizens to feel empowered by engaging in activism that bears no personal cost, such as the campaign &quot;Buy Nothing Day&quot;. These critics express a need for &quot;resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its symptoms&quot;.

In 1999, Adbusters won the award for National Magazine of the Year in Canada.

<text>The Yorkshire Wolds are hills in the counties of the East Riding of Yorkshire and North Yorkshire in Northern England. They are the northernmost chalk hills in the UK and within lies the northernmost chalk stream in Europe, the Gypsey Race.

On the western edge, the Wolds rise to an escarpment which then drops sharply to the Vale of York. The highest point on the escarpment is Bishop Wilton Wold (also known as Garrowby Hill), which is above sea level. To the north, on the other side of the Vale of Pickering, lie the North York Moors, and to the east the hills flatten into the plain of Holderness. The hills are separated by many dry dales, formed during the last ice age and where many springs rise. 

The largest town in the Wolds is Driffield, with other places including Pocklington, Thixendale and Kilham, the original &#x27;capital&#x27; of the Wolds. The highest village on the Yorkshire Wolds is Fridaythorpe at above sea level. The market town of Beverley lies on the eastern slopes, along with the village of Molescroft.

On 8 October 2024, Natural England launched a statutory and public consultation for proposed plans to designate part of the Yorkshire Wolds as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

==Geology==
The hills are formed from a series of pure marine limestones formed during the Cretaceous period, known collectively as the Chalk Group. The outcrop has the form of an arc running north from Ferriby on the Humber estuary west of Hull northwards past Market Weighton to the Malton area where it swings eastwards towards the North Sea coast between Filey and Bridlington. Here the Chalk forms cliffs, most notably at Speeton Cliffs, Bempton Cliffs and Flamborough; Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. To the south of the Humber Gap, where the chalk provides stable footings for the Humber Bridge, the same formations continue as the Lincolnshire Wolds. The rock succession in stratigraphic order i.e. youngest/uppermost first, is this:
*White Chalk Subgroup
**Flamborough Chalk Formation
**Burnham Chalk formation
**Welton Chalk Formation
*Grey Chalk Subgroup 
**Ferriby Chalk Formation
**Hunstanton Chalk Formation

The thin Hunstanton Chalk and Ferriby Chalk formations form the lower parts of the west and north facing Wolds scarp but it is the overlying Welton Chalk Formation which forms the greater part of these slopes. The Burnham Chalk and Flamborough Chalk formations characterise the incised plateau surface and easterly dip-slope down to the North Sea coast. In the north the Chalk rises above the Speeton Clay Formation which underlies The Carrs and above the Ampthill Clay and Kimmeridge Clay of the Vale of Pickering. Further south and particularly to the south of Market Weighton, the lowermost part of the scarp and the vale to the west is formed from a great variety of Jurassic age strata. A fault which downthrows the rock strata to the west effectively truncates the Wolds at Hunmanby in the northeast, though the offset chalk outcrop continues east to the coast at Speeton Cliffs. The numerous dry valleys cut into the dip-slope are typically floored by head, locally derived clay, silt, sand and gravel. Unlike surrounding areas, the Wolds are free from glacial till as, other than along the coastal zone, the area was not inundated by ice during the last ice age.

==Natural history==
Most of the area takes the form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by numerous deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry; indeed, surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. Typically the valleys are hard to see from above, creating the visual impression that the landscape is much flatter than is actually the case. The unusual topography results in an &quot;upside-down&quot; farming system – livestock (mostly sheep and cows) graze the valleys, with the hills above used for crops.

==Climate==
Located in the northern part of England, UK, the Yorkshire Wolds have a temperate maritime climate which is dominated by the passage of mid latitude depressions. The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream makes the region mild for its latitude. The higher ground of the Wolds results in their being slightly cooler than the surrounding lowland areas and drifting snow is a problem in winter. The average total annual rainfall is with rain falling on average 128 days of the year. January is usually the coldest month and December the wettest. The warmest month is August and the driest is February.


==Areas and notable settlements==

===Northern Wolds and Flamborough Head===
The Wolds reach the sea at Flamborough Head, where the chalk cliffs plunge over to the North Sea. To the south of Flamborough lies the resort town of Bridlington and to the north the sheer cliffs at Speeton overlook Filey Bay. Inland the high Wolds scarp overlooks the Vale of Pickering.

The so-called Great Wold Valley traverses the area. It is occupied by a small brook called the Gypsey Race. This brook empties its waters into Bridlington Harbour. The valley of the Gypsey Race turns south and then east in two right angle bends, one at Burton Fleming, the other at Rudston. In dry conditions the brook frequently dries up in parts of its course and re-emerges downstream.

Another notable feature of this area of the Wolds is Danes Dyke, a great ditch extending across Flamborough Head. The dyke consists of double ramparts, a ditch which is about wide and deep and a further rampart which rises to above ground level. The origin of this feature is obscure, although it is certainly not Danish.

Bempton Cliffs is a seabird colony and an RSPB nature reserve. It is home to the only colony of gannets in mainland England, 10% of the UK&#x27;s resident kittiwakes, and a colony of the locally endangered Atlantic puffin.
Notable settlements include Flamborough village, North Landing and South Landing on Flamborough Headland. The village of Reighton which extends down the steep scarp face of the Wolds has many buildings made of the local chalk. Hunmanby was once a large market town and its buildings are centred on the old triangular market place.
A series of villages lies at the foot of the northern scarp of the Wolds each having a parish which contains an area of chalk hillside, fertile benches and marshy land on the Vale of Pickering.
Fordon consists only of a few farms and a small church, some parts of which are of Norman construction. Wold Newton and Burton Fleming lie in the Great Wold Valley. A large round barrow called Willy Howe (Howe, a topographic name from Middle English, originated with the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; meaning a small hill or a man-made mound or barrow.) lies between Wold Newton and Thwing. At Rudston Britain&#x27;s tallest standing stone can be seen in the church yard. Boynton Hall was the home of William Strickland who is reputed to have brought the turkey to England.
On the Wold top there are many traces of pre-historic peoples such as the barrows at Willerby Wold and Sharpe Howes above Folkton.

===Driffield area===

On the seaward dip slope of the Wolds there is a series of villages extending from Bridlington to Driffield. These mark the spring line and the natural boundary between the chalk Wolds and the clay of Holderness. Driffield lies central to the crescentic shape of the Wolds area and since all of the Wolds are within easy reach it has become an important market town and is known as the Capital of the Wolds.

Villages of note include: Nafferton, which lies just off the A166 road and is the site of a mill pond fed by springs, Wansford to the south, lies on the Driffield canal and it has a church built by Sir Tatton Sykes in 1868. Close to Ruston Parva is Danes Graves, an archaeological site consisting of some 500 small round barrows marking Iron Age burials at least one of which yielded a corpse buried with a chariot and harness. Burton Agnes contains the ruins of a manor house dating from 1170 AD and a hall and gatehouse of the Elizabethan period. Kilham was a prosperous market town in the Medieval period but was replaced by Driffield in the 19th century as the Capital of the Wolds. In this area there is a long continuity of settlement with an Iron Age cemetery, the Roman road now known as Woldgate and an Anglian cemetery all in close proximity. Sledmere village has a uniformity of aspect which reveals its history as an &#x27;estate&#x27; village. Close by is Sledmere House, the home of the Sykes family since the 18th century.
===Southern Wolds===
In the south the Wolds are at their narrowest. Here they lie between the plain of Holderness to the east and the Vale of York to the west. The Humber Estuary cuts through the chalk formation leaving the Yorkshire Wolds to the north and the Lincolnshire Wolds to the south. In Roman times the estuary was crossed by a ford. The Humber Bridge now spans the estuary. This area has fine agricultural land and many villages, notable amongst which are: Walkington with its village pond and church of All Hallows: Bishop Burton which lies in a green hollow and has 19th century whitewashed cottages close to a village green with a large pond: Cherry Burton sits in a shallow valley in the shadow of the St Michael&#x27;s and All Angels Church: Skidby which has an intact working windmill dating from 1821 which is now an agricultural museum. North Newbald is sited in a narrow valley on the western scarp of the Wolds and has a famous cruciform Norman church dedicated to St Nicholas. Beverley sits in the north-eastern corner of the Southern Wolds, with the common grazing lands of Swinemoor and the Figham Pastures being where the hills terminate, where extensive wetlands exist. The town is also home to the Beverley Minster which was founded, along with Beverley Grammar School, the oldest grammar school in the British Isles, by St John of Beverley in 700 AD. Beverley has been a sanctuary town since 978 AD, when King Athelstan visited the tomb of St John in St Mary&#x27;s Church.

The village of Brantingham is home to Hull Ionians, a Rugby Union team who play in the Northern 1 league, the third tier of English Rugby Union. Beverley is home to both Beverley RUFC (who play in the Yorkshire Division One, the seventh tier of English Rugby Union) and Beverley Town Cricket Club (who play in the Yorkshire Premier League North Premier Division, the highest level of recreational cricket possible in England and Wales) . 

===Central Wolds===
The western scarp of the Wolds reaches is highest point at Garrowby Hill. Wooded dales occur along the scarp with small becks flowing down to the Vale of York below. The market towns of Pocklington and Market Weighton are sited between the wolds and the vale. Large parks and houses lie along the scarp from Garrowby Hall to Kilnwick Percy, Warter Priory and Londesborough Hall. Millington is situated within Millington Dale and the road leading along the brow of the dale is particularly scenic. The village of Kiplingcotes is the location for the annual Kiplingcotes Derby horse race, said to be the oldest horse race in England. The 499th event took place on 15 March 2018 but was reduced to a horse being led round the course.
===Western Wolds===
From Garrowby Hill northwards to Ganton the high scarp of the Wolds swings in a crescent to overlook the Vales of York and Pickering. Villages tend to be clustered along the scarp foot or in the upper part of the Great Wold Valley. Rillington is a village with a stream passing through and a nearby park at Scampston. Between the villages of West Knapton and East Knapton there is a hall and park, while south-east of the villages in Knapton Wood is &quot;Staple Howe&quot;, an Iron Age site. The twin villages of East and West Heslerton lie further along the A64 road. West Heslerton is a well known archaeological site, with artefacts from several eras having been recovered. Wharram Percy is one of the most notable deserted village sites in the UK.

==History and archaeology==
The Wolds area is rich in archaeological remains. There is a profusion of Neolithic, Bronze Age and Romano-British sites extending across the entire Yorkshire Wolds area.
The availability of fertile chalk soils, good grazing and the light tree cover along with stone suitable for making tools made this area attractive to early Neolithic settlers.
Along with Wessex and Orkney, the Yorkshire Wolds is a key area for studying the development of the Neolithic period in the British Isles as it became a major focus for settlement in this era. Isolated farms rather than settlements of any size appear to have been the normal dwelling types however few have been located with any certainty and most evidence is of funerary sites and ritual monuments. Recently excavated long barrows at Fordon on Willerby Wold and at Kilham have been carbon dated to around 3700 BC. A well-known round barrow of this period is the monumental Duggleby Howe, at the western end of the Great Wolds Valley, partially excavated in 1890 by J.R. Mortimer. A henge monument of the Neolithic has been identified at Maidens Grave Rudston and the Rudston Monolith has also been assigned to this period. An extensive Neolithic ritual complex, the main elements of which are four large cursus monuments and a henge, is situated near the eastern end of the Great Wold Valley.

More than 1,400 Bronze Age round barrows, comprising one or more burials and accompanied by items of grave goods, are known to exist on the Yorkshire Wolds. They occur either in isolation or, more commonly, grouped together to form cemeteries. Many of these sites, although they have been reduced in size by repeated ploughing, still form upstanding and, in some cases, prominent features in the present-day landscape.

The Romans arrived in this area around 71 AD. From a base at Brough on the north bank of the Humber they established a road network with one branch towards York and another to Malton, both crossing the Wolds area. The settlements of the native Parisi were little disturbed by the Roman occupiers at first, but in later years they became Romanised, adopting the Roman material culture. There are villa sites on the Wolds at Rudston, Harpham, Brantingham, Welton and Wharram-le-Street.

Walkington Wold, near the village of Walkington in the southern area of the Wolds, is the site of an Anglo-Saxon execution cemetery, the only known example from northern England.
In 2014, two horse skeletons and the remains of a chariot dating back to the Iron Age were unearthed on a Pocklington building site.

==Culture and media==
The writer Winifred Holtby who was born at Rudston lived in the area and described the Wolds as &quot;fold upon fold of the encircling hills, piled rich and golden.&quot;

The Yorkshire Wolds Versatile Brass performs in local venues in the Yorkshire Wolds region.

David Hockney has featured the Yorkshire Wolds in many of his paintings that were shown at the Royal Academy in the exhibition &#x27;A Bigger Picture&#x27; in the spring of 2012.

&quot;Yorkshire Wolds Way&quot;, a two-part BBC television documentary, first broadcast in January 2017, features a journey along the Yorkshire Wolds Way.

==Wolds Way==
One of nine National Trails in England, the Yorkshire Wolds Way is a long-distance footpath which runs the length of the wolds from the Humber Bridge at Hessle to Filey on the coast. It is managed by Natural England.

<doc id="224101" wikidata="Q15179" url="?curid=224101" title="Moustache">
<text>A moustache (; mustache, ) is a growth of facial hair grown above the upper lip and under the nose. Moustaches have been worn in various styles throughout history.
==Etymology==
The word &quot;moustache&quot; is French, and is derived from the Italian &quot;mustaccio&quot; (14th century), dialectal &quot;mostaccio&quot; (16th century), from Medieval Latin &quot;mustacchium&quot; (eighth century), Medieval Greek μουστάκιον (&quot;moustakion&quot;), attested in the ninth century, which ultimately originates as a diminutive of Hellenistic Greek μύσταξ (&quot;mustax&quot;, &quot;mustak-&quot;), meaning &quot;upper lip&quot; or &quot;facial hair&quot;, probably derived from Hellenistic Greek μύλλον (&quot;mullon&quot;), &quot;lip&quot;.

An individual wearing a moustache is said to be &quot;moustached&quot; or &quot;moustachioed&quot; (the latter often referring to a particularly large or bushy moustache).

==History==
Research done on this subject has noticed that the prevalence of moustaches and facial hair in general rise and fall according to the saturation of the marriage market. Thus, the density and thickness of the moustache or beard may help to convey androgen levels or age.

Earliest depictions of moustache trace back to Ancient Egypt old kingdom era (ca. 2649–2130 B.C.)
One of the earliest documents of the usage of moustaches (without the beard) can be traced to Iron Age Celts. According to Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian:

Moustaches would not go away during the Middle Ages. One prominent example of the moustache in early medieval art is the Sutton Hoo helmet, an elaborately-decorated helmet sporting a faceplate depicting the style on its upper lip. Later on, Welsh leaders and English royalty such as Edward of Wales, would also often wear only a moustache.

Moustache popularity in the west peaked in the 1880s and 1890s coinciding with a popularity in the military virtues of the day.
Various cultures have developed different associations with moustaches. For example, in many 20th-century Arab countries, moustaches are associated with power, beards are associated with Islamic traditionalism, and clean-shaven or lack of facial hair are associated with more liberal, secular tendencies. In Islam, trimming the moustache is considered to be a sunnah and mustahabb, that is, a way of life that is recommended, especially among Sunni Muslims.
The moustache is also a religious symbol for the male followers of the Yarsan religion.

Shaving with stone razors was technologically possible from as far back as the Neolithic times. A moustache is depicted on a statue of the 4th Dynasty Egyptian prince Rahotep (c. 2550 BC). Another ancient portrait showing a shaved man with a moustache is an ancient Iranian (Scythian) horseman from 300 BC.

In ancient China, facial hair and the hair on the head were traditionally left untouched because of Confucian influences.

==Development and care==
The moustache forms its own stage in the development of facial hair in adolescent males.

As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals depending on one&#x27;s genetic heritage or environment.

Moustaches can be tended through shaving the hair of the chin and cheeks, preventing it from becoming a full beard. A variety of tools have been developed for the care of moustaches, including safety razors, moustache wax, moustache nets, moustache brushes, moustache combs and moustache scissors.

In the Middle East, there is a growing trend for moustache transplants, which involves undergoing a procedure called follicular unit extraction in order to attain fuller, and more impressive facial hair.

The longest moustache measures and belongs to Ram Singh Chauhan from India. It was measured on the set of the Italian TV show &quot;Lo Show dei Record&quot; in Rome, Italy, on 4 March 2010.

== Styles ==

The World Beard and Moustache Championships 2007 had six sub-categories for moustaches:
* Dalí – narrow, long points bent or curved steeply upward; areas past the corner of the mouth must be shaved. Artificial styling aids needed. Named after Salvador Dalí.
* English moustache – narrow, beginning at the middle of the upper lip the whiskers are very long and pulled to the side, slightly curled; the ends are pointed slightly upward; areas past the corner of the mouth usually shaved. Artificial styling may be needed.
* Freestyle – All moustaches that do not match other classes. The hairs are allowed to start growing from up to a maximum of 1.5 cm beyond the end of the upper lip. Aids are allowed.
* Hungarian – Big and bushy, beginning from the middle of the upper lip and pulled to the side. The hairs are allowed to start growing from up to a maximum of 1.5 cm beyond the end of the upper lip.
* Imperial – whiskers growing from both the upper lip and cheeks, curled upward (distinct from the &quot;royale&quot;, or &quot;impériale&quot;)
* Natural – Moustache may be styled without aids.

Other types of moustache include:
* Chevron – covering the area between the nose and the upper lip, out to the edges of the upper lip but no further. Popular in 1970s and 1980s American and British culture. Worn by Ron Jeremy, Richard Petty, Freddie Mercury, Bruce Forsyth and Tom Selleck.
* Fu Manchu – long, downward pointing ends, generally beyond the chin.
* Handlebar – bushy, with small upward pointing ends.
* Horseshoe – Often confused with the Handlebar Moustache, the horseshoe was possibly popularised by modern cowboys and consists of a full moustache with vertical extensions from the corners of the lips down to the jawline and resembling an upside-down horseshoe. Also known as &quot;biker moustache&quot;. Worn by Hulk Hogan and Bill Kelliher. Recently re-popularized by Gardner Minshew and Joe Exotic.
* Pancho Villa – similar to the Fu Manchu but thicker; also known as a &quot;droopy moustache&quot;. Also similar to the Horseshoe. A Pancho Villa is much longer and bushier than the moustache normally worn by the historical Pancho Villa.
* Pencil moustache – narrow, straight and thin as if drawn on by a pencil, closely clipped, outlining the upper lip, with a wide shaven gap between the nose and moustache. Popular in the 1940s, and particularly associated with Clark Gable. More recently, it has been recognised as the moustache of choice for the fictional character Gomez Addams in the 1990s series of films based on The Addams Family. Also known as a Mouth-brow, and worn by Vincent Price, John Waters, Little Richard, Sean Penn and Chris Cornell.
* Toothbrush – thick, but shaved except for about an inch (2.5 cm) in the centre; worn by Charlie Chaplin, Oliver Hardy, and Adolf Hitler, the latter of whom being responsible for the style becoming extremely unpopular, and remaining so for the nearly-century-long period extending to the present day.
* Walrus – bushy, hanging down over the lips, often entirely covering the mouth. Worn by Mark Twain, David Crosby, Joseph Stalin, John Bolton, Wilford Brimley, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter, Sam Elliott, Albert Einstein, Jamie Hyneman and Robert Johansson .
* Pornstache – A thick, heavy moustache with slightly elongated ends. The style originates among male pornographic actors in the 1970s and was most popular in the 1980s. The pornstache has been worn by celebrities such as Freddie Mercury, Lionel Richie, and Pedro Pascal.

==Occurrence and perceptions==

Like many other fashion trends, the moustache is subject to shifting popularity through time. Though modern culture often associates moustaches with men of the Victorian era, Susan Walton shows that at the start of the Victorian era facial hair was &quot;viewed with distaste&quot; and that the moustache was considered the mark of an artist or revolutionary, both of which remained on the social fringe at the time. This is supported by the fact that only one Member of Parliament sported facial hair from the years 1841–1847. However, by the 1860s, this had changed and moustaches became wildly popular, even among distinguished men, but by the end of the century, facial hair became passé once more. Though one cannot be entirely sure as to the cause of such changes, Walton speculates that the rise of the facial hair trend was due largely in part to the impending war against Russia, and the belief that moustaches and beards projected a more &#x27;manly&#x27; image, which was brought about by the so-called &#x27;rebranding&#x27; of the British military and the rehabilitation of military virtues. Moustaches became a defining trait of the British soldier, and until 1916, no enlisted soldier was permitted to shave his upper lip. However, the next generation of men perceived facial hair, such as moustaches, to be an outdated emblem of masculinity and therefore there was a dramatic decline in the moustache trend and a clean-shaven face became the mark of a modern man.

===Marriage===
According to a study performed by Nigel Barber, results have shown a strong correlation between a good marriage market for women and an increased number of moustaches worn by the male population. By comparing the number of males pictured in &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; sporting a moustache against the ratio of single women to single men, the similar trends in the two over the years would suggest that these two factors are correlated. Barber suggests that this correlation may be due to the fact that men with moustaches are perceived to be more attractive, industrious, creative, masculine, dominant and mature by both men and women, as supported by the research conducted by Hellström and Tekle. Barber suggests that these perceived traits would influence a woman&#x27;s choice of husband as they would suggest likely high reproductive success and other good biological qualities, and a capacity to invest in children, so when males must compete heavily for marriage they are more likely to grow a moustache in an attempt to project these qualities. This theory is also supported by the correlation between beard fashion and women wearing long dresses, as shown by Robinson&#x27;s study, which then relates to the correlation between dress fashion and the marriage market, as shown in Barber&#x27;s 1999 study.

===Age perception===
The moustache and other forms of facial hair are globally understood to be signs of the post-pubescent male; however, those with moustaches are perceived to be older than those who are clean-shaven of the same age. This was determined by manipulating a photo of six male subjects, with varying levels of baldness, to have moustaches and beards and then asking undergraduate college students to rate both the photos of the men with facial hair and without facial hair in terms of social maturity, aggression, age, appeasement, and attractiveness. Regardless of how bald the subject was, the results found in relation to the perception of moustaches remained constant. Although males with facial hair were perceived, in general, to be older than the same subject pictured without facial hair, the moustached subjects were also perceived to be far less socially mature. The decreased perception of social maturity of the men with moustaches may partially be due to the increase in the perception of aggression in the moustachioed men, as aggression is incompatible with social maturity.

===Workplace===
In a study performed by J. A. Reed and E. M. Blunk, persons in management positions were shown to positively perceive, and therefore be more likely to hire, men with facial hair. Although men with beards overall scored better than men with only moustaches, the moustached men scored much higher than those men who were clean-shaven. In this experiment, 228 people, both male and female, who held management positions that made hiring decisions were shown ink sketches of six male job applicants. The men in these ink sketches ranged from clean-shaven, to moustachioed, to bearded. The men with facial hair were rated higher by the employers on aspects of masculinity, maturity, physical attractiveness, dominance, self-confidence, nonconformity, courage, industriousness, enthusiasm, intelligence, sincerity, and general competency. The results were found to be fairly similar for both female and male employers, which Reed and Blunk suggest would imply that gender does not factor into one&#x27;s perceptions of a moustache on a male applicant. However, Blunk and Reed also stipulate that the meaning and acceptability of facial hair does change depending on the time period. However, again, the studies performed by Hellström and Tekle and also the studies performed by Klapprott would suggest that moustaches are not favourable to all professions as it has been shown that clean-shaven men are seen as more reliable in roles such as salesmen and professors. Other studies have suggested that acceptability of facial hair may vary depending on culture and location, as in a study conducted in Brazil, clean-shaven men were preferred by personnel managers over applicants who were bearded, goateed, or moustached.

===Cultures===
In Western culture, it has been shown that women dislike men who displayed a visible moustache or beard, but preferred men who had a visible hint of a beard such as stubble (often known as a five o&#x27;clock shadow) over those who were clean-shaven. This supports the idea that in Western culture, females prefer men who have the capability to cultivate facial hair, such as a moustache, but choose not to. However some researchers have suggested that it is possible that in ecologies in which physical aggressiveness is more adaptive than cooperation, bearded men might be preferred by women. However, varying opinion on moustaches is not reserved to international cultural differences as even within the US, there have been discrepancies observed on female preference of male facial hair as Freedman&#x27;s study suggested that women studying at the University of Chicago preferred men with facial hair because they perceived them to be more masculine, sophisticated and mature than clean-shaven men. Similarly, a study performed by Kenny and Fletcher at Memphis State University suggested that men with facial hair, such as moustaches and beards, were perceived as stronger and more masculine by female students. However, the study performed by Feinman and Gill would suggest that this reaction to facial hair is not nationwide, as women studying in the state of Wyoming showed a marked preference for clean-shaven men over men with facial hair. Some accredit this difference to the difference between region, rurality, and political and social conservatism between the various studies. Thus it can be seen that even within the US, there are slight variations in the perceptions of moustaches.

===Religions===
In addition to various cultures, the perception of the moustache is also altered by religion as some religions support the growth of a moustache or facial hair in general, whereas others tend to reject those with moustaches, while many churches remain somewhat ambivalent on the subject.

====Amish====

While Amish men grow beards after marriage and never trim them, they eschew moustaches and continue shaving their upper lips. This is rooted in a rejection of the German military fashion of sporting moustaches, which was prevalent at the time of the Amish community&#x27;s formation in Switzerland; hence serving as a symbol of their commitment to pacifism.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
Though it is never explicitly stated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that all male members must be clean-shaven, within Latter-day Saint circles it is often considered &quot;taboo&quot; for men to have moustaches as the missionaries of the church are required to be clean-shaven as well as the honor code of Brigham Young University requiring students to have similar grooming standards. This has become somewhat of a social norm within the church itself. This often leads those members who do choose to wear moustaches feel somewhat like they do not quite fit the norm, and yet in the studies shown done by Nielsen and White, these men reportedly do not mind this feeling and that is why they continue to grow their facial hair.

====Islam====
Even though facial grooming is not specifically mentioned within the Qur&#x27;an, numerous narrations of hadith (reported sayings of Muhammad) address personal hygiene, including facial hair maintenance. In one such example, Muhammad advised that men must grow beards, and as to moustaches, cut the longer hairs as to not let them cover the upper lips (as this is the Fitra, the tradition of prophets). Thus, growing a beard while keeping the moustache from covering the upper lip is a well-established tradition in many Muslim societies.

== Notable moustaches ==
===Individuals===
The longest moustache measures and belongs to Ram Singh Chauhan of India. It was measured on the set of &quot;Lo Show dei Record&quot; in Rome, Italy, on 4 March 2010.

In some cases, the moustache is so prominently identified with a single individual that it could identify him without any further identifying traits. For example, Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s moustache, grossly exaggerated, featured prominently in Triple Entente propaganda. Other notable individuals include: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Saddam Hussein, Hulk Hogan, Don Frye, Dan Severn, Freddie Mercury, Salvador Dalí, Frank Zappa, Sam Elliott, Tom Selleck, Burt Reynolds, Steve Harvey. In other cases, such as those of Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx, the moustache in question was artificial for most of the wearer&#x27;s life.

Following a moped accident that left him with a scar on his upper lip, Paul McCartney decided to grow a moustache in order to hide it. The other members of the Beatles decided to do the same. They were first seen with this new look on the cover of their 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. This marked the return of young men wearing moustaches in the 1960s.

=== In art, entertainment, and media===

====Alias====
*&quot;Moustache&quot; was the alias name of a French comic actor, François-Alexandre Galipedes (b. 14 February 1929 in Paris, France – d. 25 March 1987 in Arpajon, Essonne, France), known for his roles in &quot;Paris Blues&quot; (1961), &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966), and &quot;Zorro&quot; (1975)

====Fictional characters====
*Moustaches have long been used by artists to make characters distinctive, as with Charlie Chan, the video game character Mario, Daniel Plainview, Omni-Man, Mike Haggar, Tony Stark, Dr Strange, King Bradley, Saxton Hale, Hercule Poirot, The Lorax, Yosemite Sam or Snidely Whiplash. 
*The Bollywood film Sharabi had a character Natthulal whose moustache became a legend. &quot;Munchhen hon to Natthulal jaisi, warna na hon&quot; (Moustaches should be like Natthulal&#x27;s or should not be at all) became one of the most quoted pieces of dialogue from the film. 
*At least one fictional moustache has been so notable that a whole style has been named after it: the Fu Manchu moustache.

*In the children&#x27;s series &quot;In The Night Garden&quot;, Mr. Pontipine has an oversized, black, fake moustache, which covers up his mouth. In the episode titled &quot;Mr. Pontipine&#x27;s Moustache Flies Away&quot;, his fake moustache flew off, but he soon got it back later. https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00dqz72/in-the-night-garden-series-1-74-mr-pontipines-moustache-flies-away

====Literature====
*In 1954, Salvador Dalí published a book dedicated solely to his moustache.

====Visual art====
They have also been used to make a social or political point as with: 
*Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;L.H.O.O.Q.&quot; (1919), a parody of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; which adds a goatee and moustache 
*Frida Kahlo&#x27;s moustachioed self-portraits

=== In the military ===
*In the Indian Army, most senior rifle Rajputana regiment soldiers have moustaches, and the Rajputana Moustache is a symbol of dignity, caste status, and the spirit of Rajput soldiers.
*Moustaches are also noted among U.S. Army armour and cavalry soldiers.
*Moustaches were a compulsory part of the British Army uniform until 1916, and were quite often worn by soldiers later in the Falklands Campaign.

=== In sport ===
*In the early-1970s, Major League Baseball players seldom wore facial hair. As detailed in the book &quot;Mustache Gang&quot;, Oakland Athletics owner Charlie Finley decided to hold a moustache-growing contest within his team. When the A&#x27;s faced the Cincinnati Reds, whose team rules forbade facial hair, in the 1972 World Series, the series was dubbed by media as &quot;the hairs vs. the squares&quot;.
*For the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, the Croatia men&#x27;s national water polo team grew moustaches in honour of coach Ratko Rudić.
*During the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London Chileans supporters painted moustaches on their skin as a sign of support of gymnast Tomás González. A site called &quot;bigoteolimipico.com&quot; (olympicmoustache) was created to allow people create Twitter avatars and Facebook images with moustaches in support of González.
*NHL player George Parros was so well known for his moustache that replicas were sold by his team, with proceeds going to charity.
*Formula 1 driver Nigel Mansell wore a famous chevron moustache during his racing career. While he shaved it off after his retirement, he did later grow it back.
*NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt was well known for his moustache.

<doc id="224102" wikidata="Q739908" url="?curid=224102" title="Manzanillo, Colima">
<text>Manzanillo () is the most populous city in the Mexican state of Colima and seat of Manzanillo Municipality. The city, located on the Pacific Ocean, contains Mexico&#x27;s busiest port, responsible for handling Pacific cargo for the Mexico City area. It is the largest-producing municipality for the business sector and tourism in the small state of Colima.

The city has been referred to as the &quot;sailfish capital of the world&quot;. Since 1957, it has hosted national and international fishing competitions, such as the Dorsey Tournament. Manzanillo has developed as a destination for international tourism.

==History==
;16th century
In 1522, Gonzalo de Sandoval, under orders from conquistador Hernán Cortés, dropped anchor in the Bay of Salagua (north of Manzanillo Bay), looking for safe harbors and good shipbuilding sites. In the year before he left, Sandoval granted an audience to local Native chieftains in a small cove, which today carries the name Playa de La Audiencia. A great part of his fleet, which left to conquer the Philippines, was constructed in Salagua.

Manzanillo Bay was discovered in 1527 by navigator Alvaro de Saavedra, naming it Santiago de la Buena Esperanza, or &quot;St. James of Good Hope&quot;. Manzanillo was the third port created by the Spanish in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. It became a departure point for important expeditions. Cortés visited the bay twice to protect his galleons from Portuguese pirates. Over the next 300 years, the Pacific Coast&#x27;s history is filled with accounts of pirates from Portugal, England, France and even Spain assaulting, looting and burning ships for their rich cargos.

;19th century
In 1825 the Port of Manzanillo opened, in recently independent Mexico, and so named because of the abundant groves of native Manzanilla (&quot;Hippomane mancinella&quot;) trees that were used extensively in the early days of shipbuilding. Manzanillo was raised to the status of a city on 15 June 1873. The railroad to Colima was completed in 1889.

;20th century
In 1908, President Porfirio Diaz designated Manzanillo as an official port of entry to Mexico. It was the state capital of Colima from 20 February to 1 March 1915, while Pancho Villa&#x27;s troops were threatening to capture the city of Colima.

;21st century
==Description==
In the 2005 census, the city of Manzanillo had a population of 110,728 and in 2010 its municipality had 161,420. It is the second-largest community in the state, after Colima, the capital. The municipality covers an area of , and includes such outlying communities as El Colomo, in addition to many smaller communities. Manzanillo is also a beach resort, and is one of many locations to promote themselves as the &quot;sailfish capital&quot; of the world. One way they promote that claim is by hosting a yearly sailfish fishing tournament. The Revillagigedo Islands, off the west coast of Mexico in the Pacific Ocean, are part of the municipality, but they are directly administered by the federal government.

Manzanillo is a sister city of the U.S. cities of Flagstaff, Arizona; San Pablo, California; and Saint Paul, Minnesota.
==Tourism==

The city is well known internationally for deep-sea fishing and the green flash phenomenon during sunsets, as well as the warm waters of the ocean. The city is a destination resort and has many hotels and self-contained resorts, particularly built on the De Santiago peninsula which juts out into the Pacific north of the city centre. Also at the north end of Manzanillo bay is the resort Las Hadas (&quot;the fairies&quot;), which is the most famous of the city&#x27;s resorts, having been featured in the movie &quot;10&quot; starring Bo Derek and Dudley Moore. Beach scenes were filmed on La Audencia Bay, just over the hill from Las Hadas.
Manzanillo is a popular cruise ship port of call. Many tourists go from their cruise ships on city tours. Excellent swimming, snorkeling, and scuba diving is found in Santiago Bay, a few miles north of the city where a cargo ship sank in a hurricane in 1959. Other wrecks and reefs plentiful with fish are scattered throughout the bay.
SS &quot;Golden Gate&quot; sank in 1862 in nearby Playa de Oro, which is named after the huge cargo of gold she was carrying.
Optimists still search for gold on the beach.

Manzanillo is known as the Sailfish Capital of the World. Since 1957, it has hosted important national and international fishing competitions, such as the Dorsey Tournament, making it a very attractive fishing destination.

Manzanillo consists of two bays with crescent-shaped beaches, each about 4 miles in length. Bahía de Manzanillo is closer to downtown and is the older tourist section. Bahía de Santiago, to the west, is the newer and more upscale area. The two are separated by the Santiago Peninsula. Ship channels are located at the southeast end of Bahía de Manzanillo where large cruise ships enter the port area. Manzanillo was once the scene of piracy and adventure. By 2011, its peaceful bays and sophisticated tourist and port infrastructure had made it one of the main tourist resorts and trading centers in the west of Mexico.

On 6 July 2010, the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes) opened a specialized dock for cruise ships at the port, which involved an investment of $100 million pesos (MXN) in the first stage. A second phase foresees the construction of a shopping centre.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Manzanillo has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). The dry season, which is from November to May, has low amounts of precipitation, and temperatures tend to be cooler than in the wet season. The average temperature in March, the coolest month, is . The wet season, which runs from June to October, has warmer temperatures, averaging in July, and humidity during this time is higher.

In 2012, the port of Manzanillo initiated an ecological project consisting of dredged canals and creating islands in the Lagoon of the Valle de las Garzas, a protected wildlife area. With this work, the port plans to increase the flow into the lagoon, thus increasing the viability of the enhanced ecosystem that includes the planting of 15,000 mangrove trees. Extensive use of geotextile tubes was included in the channel creation. These geotextile tubes were used to create two parallel breakwaters on either side of the dredged channels.

==Hurricane Patricia==
On Friday, 23 October 2015, Manzanillo was caught in the path of Hurricane Patricia. A Category 5 on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane wind scale, it was the most powerful cyclone ever measured in the Western Hemisphere, with sustained winds speed up to 200 mph (320 km/h). Hurricane Patricia made landfall on 23 October at 7:45pm with catastrophic damage. The center of the storm hit just north of Manzanillo, saving the town from the 200 mph winds. Puerto Vallarta was also near the catastrophic damage zone. Wind and high surf created a catastrophic damage zone. Damage totaled at least $283 million.

== Transportation ==
Manzanillo is the busiest port in Mexico, as measured by total tonnage and volume of containerized cargo. In 2007, the port moved 1.4 million TEUs and 18.0 million tons of total cargo. Port business experienced a significant surge during the USA&#x27;s West Coast Lockout in Long Beach, California, in 2002. The port is connected by Ferromex rail lines to Guadalajara and Mexico City.

Manzanillo is also home to the Navy&#x27;s Pacific Naval Force. Manzanillo also hosts the most efficient port for tuna landings in Mexico. It handles exports like fish, corn, copra, lemons, bananas, canned foods, wine, lumber, and minerals.

Manzanillo is well connected by Highway 200 to Colima City, to the Northwest and to Puerto Vallarta.

The Playa de Oro International Airport (ZLO) is a small airport located about 35 minutes north of Manzanillo along Highway 200. The airport offers international and national flights. In addition to flights to and from the US, the airport has international service to and from Canada. The airport is operated by &quot;Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico&quot;. Ground transportation is limited to taxis and car rentals. It has daily domestic and international flights and has recently been remodeled.

<text>Jonathan Harshman Winters (November 11, 1925 – April 11, 2013) was an American comedian, actor, author, television host, and artist. He started performing as a stand up comedian before transitioning his career to acting in film and television. Winters received numerous accolades including two Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, the American Academy of Achievement in 1973, and the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 1999.

Beginning in 1960, Winters recorded many classic comedy albums for the Verve Records label including &quot;The Wonderful World of Jonathan Winters&quot; (1960). He also had records released every decade for over 50 years, receiving 11 Grammy nominations, including eight for Best Comedy Album, during his career. From these nominations, he won the Grammy Award for Best Album for Children for his contribution to an adaptation of &quot;The Little Prince&quot; in 1975 and the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album for &quot;Crank(y) Calls&quot; in 1996.

With a career spanning more than six decades, Winters also appeared in hundreds of television shows and films, including eccentric characters on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, &quot;The Wacky World of Jonathan Winters&quot; (1972–74), &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, and &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. For his role in the 1963 comedy film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In 1991, Winters won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for playing Gunny Davis in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Davis Rules&quot;. In 2002, he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance as Q.T. Marlens on &quot;Life with Bonnie&quot;. Winters was presented with a Pioneer TV Land Award by Robin Williams in 2008. 

He also voiced Grandpa Smurf on &quot;The Smurfs&quot; TV series from 1986 to the show&#x27;s conclusion in 1989. Over twenty years later, Winters was introduced to a new generation through voicing Papa Smurf in &quot;The Smurfs&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Smurfs 2&quot; (2013). Winters died nine days after recording his dialogue for &quot;The Smurfs 2&quot;; the film was dedicated to his memory. Winters also spent time painting and presenting his artwork, including silkscreens and sketches, in many gallery shows. He authored several books including his book of short stories entitled &quot;Winters&#x27; Tales&quot; (1988).

==Early life==
Winters was born in Dayton, Ohio, to Alice Kilgore Rodgers and Jonathan Harshman Winters II, an insurance agent who later became an investment broker. He was a descendant of Valentine Winters, founder of the Winters National Bank in Dayton, Ohio. Of English and Scottish-Irish ancestry, Winters had described his father as an alcoholic who had trouble holding a job. His grandfather, a frustrated comedian, owned the Winters National Bank, which failed as the family&#x27;s fortunes collapsed during the Great Depression.

When he was seven, his parents separated. Winters&#x27; mother took him to Springfield, Ohio, to live with his maternal grandmother. &quot;Mother and dad didn&#x27;t understand me; I didn&#x27;t understand them,&quot; Winters told Jim Lehrer on &quot;The News Hour with Jim Lehrer&quot; in 1999. &quot;So consequently it was a strange kind of arrangement.&quot; Alone in his room, he created characters and interviewed himself. A poor student, Winters continued talking to himself and developed a repertoire of strange sound effects. He often entertained his high school friends by imitating a race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

In another television interview, Winters described how deeply he was hurt by his parents&#x27; divorce. He fought youthful tormentors who ridiculed him for not having a father in his life. When the tormentors were not around, he would go to a building or tree and weep in despair. Winters said that he learned to laugh at his situation but admitted that his adult life had been a response to sorrow.

During his senior year at Springfield High School, Winters quit school, joined the U.S. Marine Corps at the age of seventeen and served years in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Upon his return, he attended Kenyon College. He later studied cartooning at Dayton Art Institute, where he met Eileen Schauder, whom he married on September 11, 1948. He was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Lambda chapter).

==Early career==
Winters&#x27;s career started from a lost wristwatch about six or seven months after his marriage to Eileen in 1948. The newlyweds couldn&#x27;t afford to buy another one; then Eileen read about a talent contest in which the first prize was a wristwatch and encouraged Jonathan to &quot;go down and win it.&quot; She was certain he could, and he did. His performance led to a disc jockey job, where he was supposed to introduce songs and announce the temperature. Gradually his ad libs, personae, and antics took over the show. He began acting along with developing comedy routines while studying at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. He was also a local radio personality on WING (mornings, 6 to 8) in Dayton, Ohio, and at WIZE in Springfield, Ohio. He performed as &quot;Johnny Winters&quot; on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio, for years. Jerome R. &quot;Ted&quot; Reeves, then program director for WBNS-TV, arranged for his first audition with CBS in New York City.

After promising his wife that he would return to Dayton if he did not make it in a year, and with $56.46 in his pocket, he moved to New York City, staying with friends in Greenwich Village. After obtaining Martin Goodman as his agent, he began stand-up routines in various New York nightclubs. His earliest network television appearance was in 1954 on &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot;, hosted by Dennis James on the DuMont Television Network, where Winters again appeared as &quot;Johnny Winters&quot;.

Winters made television history in 1956 when RCA broadcast the first public demonstration of color videotape on &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;. Author David Hajdu wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (2006), &quot;He soon used video technology &#x27;to appear as two characters,&#x27; bantering back and forth, seemingly in the studio at the same time. You could say he invented the video stunt.&quot;

His big break occurred (with the revised name of Jonathan) when he worked for Alistair Cooke on the CBS Television Sunday morning show &quot;Omnibus&quot;. In 1957 he performed in the first color television show, a 15-minute routine sponsored by Tums.

From 1959 to 1964, his voice was heard in a series of popular television commercials for Utica Club beer. In the ads, he provided the voices of talking beer steins named Shultz and Dooley. Later, he became a spokesman for Hefty brand trash bags, for whom he appeared as a dapper garbageman known for collecting &quot;gahr-bahj,&quot; as well as &quot;Maude Frickert&quot; and other characters. Winters also appeared in commercials as a spokesman for other brands such as Good Humor ice cream and the California Egg Commission.

Winters recorded many classic comedy albums for the Verve Records label, starting in 1960. Probably the best known of his characters from this period is &quot;Maude Frickert&quot;, the seemingly sweet old lady with the barbed tongue (reportedly named for comedic actress Maudie Prickett). He was a favorite of Jack Paar, who hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; from 1957 to 1962, and appeared frequently on his television programs, even going so far as to impersonate then U.S. president John F. Kennedy over the telephone as a prank on Paar.

Winters had a dramatic role in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;A Game of Pool&quot; (episode 3.5 aired on October 13, 1961). He also recorded Ogden Nash&#x27;s &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; poems to Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27;s classical opus.

On &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; (1962–92), Winters usually performed in the guise of some character. Carson often did not know what Winters had planned and usually had to tease out the character&#x27;s backstory during a comedic interview. Carson invented a character called &quot;Aunt Blabby&quot;, who was similar to and possibly inspired by &quot;Maude Frickert&quot;.

Winters appeared in more than 50 movies and many television shows, including particularly notable roles in the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; and in the dual roles of Henry Glenworthy and his dark, scheming brother, the Rev. Wilbur Glenworthy, in the film adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;The Loved One.&quot; Fellow comedians who starred with him in &quot;Mad World,&quot; such as Arnold Stang, said that in the long periods while they waited between scenes, Winters entertained them for hours in their trailer by becoming any character that they suggested to him.

From December 1967 to June 1969, Winters helmed his own hour-long weekly variety program on CBS (similar to the then-popular Red Skelton and Carol Burnett shows on the same network). &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot; featured guest stars of comedy and music (e.g. The Doors), recurring sketches (often featuring Winters characters such as Maude Frickert, rural Elwood P. Suggins, drunk Harold Nermlinger, Norwegian Yorny Bjorny); and an audience-request section where Winters did impressions of persons, animals, etc. in various situations, &quot;e.g.&quot;, John Wayne on the Moon. Choice bits from the latter were collected and released on a 1969 Columbia LP, &quot;Stuff &#x27;n&#x27; Nonsense&quot;. He later participated in ABC&#x27;s &quot;The American Sportsman&quot;, hosted by Grits Gresham, who took celebrities on hunting, fishing, and shooting trips to exotic places around the world.

Winters made memorable appearances on both &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot;, as well as being a regular on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. He also performed regularly as a panelist on &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;. In the mid-1970s, he appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; doing humorous reviews of films.

During the late 1960s, Winters acted in several film comedies, most prominently &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot; (1966), and &quot;Viva Max!&quot; (1969). Additionally, he was a regular (along with Woody Allen and Jo Anne Worley) on a Saturday morning children&#x27;s television program &quot;Hot Dog&quot; in the early 1970s. He also had his own syndicated show called &quot;The Wacky World of Jonathan Winters&quot; from 1972 to 1974, the music director of which, Van Alexander, was nominated for a 1973 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction of a Variety, Musical or Dramatic Program.

==1980s and 1990s career==
Jonathan Winters was a guest star on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1980. That same year, he also appeared in &quot;I Go Pogo&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Pogo for President&quot;). In 1981, he was a guest on the short-lived comedy series &quot;Aloha Paradise&quot;.

In the fourth and final season of the sci-fi-styled TV comedy &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, Winters (one of Robin Williams&#x27;s idols) was brought in as Mork &amp; Mindy&#x27;s child, Mearth. Due to the different Orkan physiology, Mork laid an egg, which grew and hatched into the much older Winters. It had been previously explained that Orkans aged &quot;backwards,&quot; thus explaining Mearth&#x27;s appearance and that of his teacher, Miss Geezba (portrayed by a then-11-year-old actress Louanne Sirota). Mork&#x27;s infant son Mearth in &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; was created in hopes of improving ratings and as an attempt to capitalize on Williams&#x27;s comedic talents. Winters had previously guest-starred in Season 3, Episode 18, as Dave McConnell, Mindy&#x27;s uncle. However, after multiple scheduling and cast changes, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;&#x27;s fourth season was already quite low in the ratings and ended up being the show&#x27;s last season.

Winters became a regular on &quot;Hee Haw&quot; during the 1983–1984 season. He was later the voice of Grandpa Smurf from 1986 to 1990 on the television series &quot;The Smurfs&quot;. Additionally, he did the voice of Bigelow in the 1985 TV film &quot;Pound Puppies&quot; and voice-acted on &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot; in 1985, among other voice roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1987, Winters was featured in NFL Films&#x27; &quot;The NFL TV Follies&quot;. That same year he published &quot;Winters&#x27; Tales: Stories and Observations for the Unusual&quot;. In 1991 and 1992, he had a supporting role on &quot;Davis Rules&quot;, a sitcom that lasted two seasons (25 episodes), for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. He played Gunny Davis, an eccentric grandfather helping raise his grandchildren after his son lost his wife.

In addition to his live-action roles, he was a guest star on &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; (in an episode where he also voiced an animated version of his &quot;Maude Frickert&quot; character) and as the narrator in &quot;Frosty Returns&quot; which airs annually aired during the Christmas season. Winters also provided the voice for the thief in &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;.

In 1994, Winters appeared as a fired factory worker (credited as &quot;Grizzled Man&quot;) in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. In an interesting role reversal, he was the serious-minded secular police chief and uncle of the character Lamont Cranston (played by Alec Baldwin) in &quot;The Shadow&quot;. That same year he voiced Stinkbomb D. Basset in the episode &quot;Smell Ya Later&quot; on &quot;Animaniacs&quot;.

Winters received eleven Grammy nominations during his career, including eight for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album; he won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album for &quot;Crank(y) Calls&quot; in 1996.

In 1996, Winters played himself in &quot;Bloopy&#x27;s Buddies&quot;, a children&#x27;s TV series on PBS designed to teach children about health and nutrition and to encourage them to exercise.

In 1999, he was awarded the Kennedy Center&#x27;s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, becoming the second recipient.

==Later years==
Winters had various roles and appeared in numerous television features throughout the early to mid-2000s. In 2000, Winters appeared in &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in the film &quot;Swing&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time&quot; ranked Winters as the No. 18 greatest stand-up comedian. In 2005 and 2006, Winters appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

In 2008, Winters was presented with a Pioneer TV Land Award by Robin Williams. That same year, PBS aired &quot;Pioneers of Television&quot;, and &quot;Make &#x27;Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America&quot; in 2009, both featuring Winters.

Winters was coaxed out of retirement to voice Papa Smurf in &quot;The Smurfs&quot; (2011), the first-ever animated/live-action Smurfs film, and later in &quot;The Smurfs 2&quot; (2013), his final film project. He died only nine days after he finished recording Papa&#x27;s voice.

Winters was originally cast in &quot;Big Finish&quot; (2014), during pre-production. It is a comedy set in a retirement home. His scheduled role was to appear alongside Jerry Lewis and Bob Newhart.

==Personal life==
Jonathan and Eileen Winters had two children.

In his interview with the Archive of American Television, Winters reported that he spent eight months in a private psychiatric hospital in 1959 and again in 1961. The comic suffered from nervous breakdowns and bipolar disorder. With unprecedented frenetic energy, Winters made obscure references to his illness and hospitalization during his stand-up routines, most famously on his 1960 comedy album, &quot;The Wonderful World of Jonathan Winters&quot;. During his classic &quot;flying saucer&quot; routine, Winters casually mentions that if he was not careful, the authorities might put him back in the &quot;zoo&quot;, referring to the institution.

&quot;These voices are always screaming to get out,&quot; Winters told the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;. &quot;They follow me around pretty much all day and night.&quot; Winters could use his talents in voice-over roles. A devotee of Groucho Marx and Laurel and Hardy, Winters once claimed, &quot;I&#x27;ve done for the most part pretty much what I intended.&quot; He told &quot;U.S. News&quot;, &quot;I ended up doing comedy, writing, and painting... I&#x27;ve had a ball, and as I get older I just become an older kid.&quot;

Winters lived near Santa Barbara, California, and was often seen browsing or &quot;hamming&quot; for the crowd at the antique and gun shows on the Ventura County fairgrounds. He often entertained the tellers and other employees whenever he visited his local bank to make a deposit or withdrawal. Additionally, he spent his time painting and attended many gallery showings, even presenting his art in one-man shows.

On January 11, 2009, Winters&#x27;s wife of more than 60 years, Eileen, died at the age of 84 after a 20-year battle with breast cancer.

==Death==
Winters died of natural causes on the evening of April 11, 2013, in Montecito, California, at the age of 87.
He was survived by his two children and five grandchildren. He was cremated, and his ashes were given to his family.

Fans of Winters placed flowers on his Hollywood Walk of Fame star on April 12, 2013, at 1:30 p.m.

Many comedians, actors, and friends gave personal tributes to Winters on social media shortly after his death. Robin Williams posted, &quot;First he was my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend. I&#x27;ll miss him huge. He was my Comedy Buddha. Long live the Buddha.&quot; In September 2013, at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards, Williams again honored the career and life of Winters. The 2013 movie &quot;The Smurfs 2&quot; was dedicated to him.

==Comedy style and legacy==
A pioneer of improvisational stand-up comedy with a gift for mimicry, impersonations, various personalities, and a seemingly bottomless reservoir of creative energy, Winters was one of the first celebrities to go public with a personal mental illness issue and felt stigmatized as a result. According to Jack Paar, &quot;If you were to ask me the funniest 25 people I&#x27;ve ever known, I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Here they are—Jonathan Winters.&#x27; He also said of Winters, &quot;Pound for pound, the funniest man alive.&quot;

With his round, rubber-faced mastery of impressions (including ones of John Wayne, Cary Grant, Groucho Marx, James Cagney, and others) and improvisational comedy, Winters became a staple of late-night television with a career spanning more than six decades. With notable honors, many television shows, films, and comedy circuit appearances, Winters was known to start his stage shows by commanding an applauding audience that had risen to its feet to: &quot;Please remain standing throughout the evening.&quot;

Winters performed a wide range of characters: hillbillies, arrogant city slickers, nerve-shattered airline pilots trying to hide their fear, disgruntled westerners, judgmental Martians, little old ladies, nosy gas station attendants, a hungry cat eyeing a mouse, the oldest living airline stewardess, and more. &quot;I was fighting for the fact that you could be funny without telling jokes,&quot; he told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, adding that he thought of himself foremost as a writer and less as a stand-up comedian. He named James Thurber&#x27;s sophisticated absurdity as influential and said he idolized writers with a gift for humor.

Two of his most memorable characters, cranky granny &quot;Maude Frickert&quot; and bumpkin farmer &quot;Elwood P. Suggins&quot; (&quot;I think eggs 24 hours a day&quot;), were born from his early television routines. Robin Williams once told &quot;Playboy&quot; why Mr. Winters inspired him. &quot;It was like seeing a guy behind a mask, and you could see that his characters were a great way for him to talk about painful stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;I found out later that they are people he knows—his mother, his aunt. He&#x27;s an artist who also paints with words. He paints these people that he sees.&quot;
Onstage and off, Winters was wildly unpredictable. He was often viewed by producers as a liability, leading to a scattershot, though memorable, film career. On television, his two self-titled variety shows displayed him in dazzling form as a sketch comic and impersonator.

Winters was an inspiration for performers such as Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, Tracey Ullman, Lily Tomlin, Steve Martin, Jim Carrey, and Jimmy Kimmel. Robin Williams credited Winters as his comedy mentor, and the two co-starred on &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;.

In a 1991 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Winters likened the entertainment industry to the Olympics, with actors standing on boxes to receive gold, silver, and bronze medals. Winters claimed, &quot;I think my place is inside the box, underneath the guy receiving the gold medal. They&#x27;re playing the national anthem and I&#x27;m fondling a platinum medallion.&quot;

<text>Louis-Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse (29 May 1747 – 24 July 1812) was a French Navy officer and politician. He was born in Auch. After serving in the Indies under Suffren, he rose in rank during the early stages of the French Revolution. He was in command of the French fleet during the Glorious First of June, where despite being handed a heavy tactical defeat, he ensured the passage of a vital grain convoy to France. 

He led the French fleet during the disastrous Croisière du Grand Hiver and failed to prevent a British fleet from successfully retreating, with his last battle being a defeat off Groix. He was relieved when he refused to serve for the disastrous Expédition d&#x27;Irlande. Villaret was then elected at the Council of Five Hundred. He joined the Club de Clichy, a party promoting colonies and slavery, and harbouring Royalist sympathies. After the Coup of 18 Fructidor, Villaret was to be deported to Cayenne but went into hiding long enough for his sentence to be commuted to exile to Oléron, where he went willingly.

Reinstated in 1801, Villaret took command of the naval component of the Saint-Domingue expedition, and was appointed captain general of Martinique and Sainte-Lucie alongside the colonial prefect, Charles-Henri Bertin. He served in this capacity until the British captured Martinique in 1809. Returned to France, Villaret fell in disfavour for his perceived weak defence during the invasion. After two years, Napoléon pardoned him and appointed him governor of Venice. Villaret died there of edema on 24 July 1812.

Louis-Thomas Villaret was born in Auch, Gascony, to the family of a fiscal officer. Unable to enter the elite naval schools, he entered the navy as a &quot;volontaire&quot; in 1768. Promoted to Lieutenant in 1773, he served as a lieutenant on the 32-gun frigate in the Indian Ocean. In 1778, unemployed in Pondicherry, he volunteered his services to the governor de Bellecombe during the siege of Pondicherry, earning the rank of capitaine de brûlot.

===Service under Suffren===
In 1781, Villaret commanded the fireship in Suffren&#x27;s fleet.

He then served under Suffren, who made him his aide in 1782. He was later transferred to the frigate &quot;Dauphine&quot;, and became First Officer on in Suffren&#x27;s squadron.

After the battle of Cuddalore on 20 June 1783, Suffren gave him command of the frigate .

A few months after, Suffren appointed Villaret to the 20-gun the corvette . He ordered him to sail to Madras and warn the French blockading squadron, composed of two ships of the line and two frigates, of the imminent arrival of a superior British force. Three days after her departure, on 11 April 1783, &quot;Naïade&quot; spotted the 64-gun , under Captain Graves; after trying without success to elude his much stronger opponent, Villaret was forced into battle, and struck his colours after a five-hour fight. When Villaret surrendered his sword, Graves allegedly told him &quot;Sir, you have given us a fairly beautiful frigate, but you made us pay dearly for her!&quot;; some authors add that Graves returned Villaret his sword.

Villaret was taken prisoner. Despite the loss of &quot;Naïade&quot;, the British squadron was unable to locate the French ships, which had already departed. &quot;Naïade&quot; was not commissioned in the Royal Navy and was sold.

Villaret was released in June 1783, after the Treaty of Versailles, and was awarded the Order of Saint Louis.

Villaret was promoted to Lieutenant in 1784 for his service. After the war, Villaret served in the harbour of Lorient.

===French Revolution===
In 1791, Villaret was appointed to command the frigate to transport troops to Saint-Domingue. Arriving shortly before the slave revolt that launched the Haitian Revolution, he helped the governor transport troops around the island.

On 14 March 1792, he swore the &quot;civic oath&quot; to the Republic, while his brother emigrated. Promoted to Captain in 1792, he was given the command of the 74-gun in 1793; in May 1793, part of a squadron under Morard de Galle, he was tasked with watching the coasts of Morbihan and Loire, to prevent the British from aiding the Revolt in the Vendée.

When the rest of the Brest fleet sailed to Belle-Isle and the Quibéron mutinies broke out among many ships in the fleet, Villaret was one of the few officers who maintained order aboard his ship.

In 1794, Villaret was promoted to Rear-admiral, and Jeanbon Saint André appointed him to command the 25-ship Brest fleet. Setting his flag on the 120-gun &quot;Montagne&quot;, Villaret reorganised and revitalised the Brest fleet. Among other measures, Saint André and Villaret-Joyeuse founded a naval artillery school.

===Atlantic campaign of May 1794===

In the summer of 1794, Villaret sailed with 23 ships of the line and 16 frigates to protect a 170-ship food convoy under Rear-admiral Vanstabel, incoming from the United States. The convoy was necessary to relieve France from famine after a disastrous harvest, and the British Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe had set out to prevent it from reaching France; the orders of the National Convention to the fleet were to stall the British forces and prevent them from intercepting the convoy at all costs.

The Brest fleet departed and sailed to the Azores to wait for the arrival of Vanstabel&#x27;s convoy. On 28 May, the French and British fleets came in contact 100 leagues off Ushant, and began seeking each other in the fog; the engagement culminated in the Glorious First of June. Although suffering severe losses, he rallied his remaining ships and rescued several of his ships; most importantly, the grain convoy reached Brest unmolested.

Supported by Saint-André, Villaret-Joyeuse kept his command despite the tactical defeat. He blamed his losses on the conduct of several of his captains who had failed to fulfil their duties. On 27 September 1794, Villaret-Joyeuse was promoted to Vice-admiral.

===Croisière du Grand Hiver===
In December, the Committee of Public Safety ordered him to attack British commerce in the Croisière du Grand Hiver. Although the cruise did lead to the capture of a number of British merchant ships, the French fleet was battered by storms in which several ships were sunk and all the surviving ships suffered heavy damage.

===Battle of Groix===
In June 1795, he sailed with nine ships to relieve a small squadron near Belle Île. During Cornwallis&#x27;s Retreat, Villaret-Joyeuse tried to engage the small British squadron blockading Belle Île. Unable to bring them to battle, Villaret attempted to return to Brest, but contrary winds forced him towards Lorient. Close to Lorient, Villaret-Joyeuse was discovered by British admiral Alexander Hood&#x27;s fleet, guarding the expedition to Quiberon. During the Second Battle of Groix, several of Villaret&#x27;s ships disobeyed his orders and sailed away, with three ships of the line being captured by the British.

In 1796, Villaret-Joyeuse was appointed to command the fleet for the Expédition d&#x27;Irlande, an attempt to land General Hoche&#x27;s army in Ireland; opposed to the project, Villaret was replaced with Morard de Galles.

===Political career===
In 1796, Villaret was elected to the Council of Five Hundred as a representative of Morbihan. As a member of the Club de Clichy, then considered to constitute the Royalist party, he gave several speeches about the colonies, speaking against the emancipation of slaves. He also lobbied in favour of strengthening the Navy.

After the Coup of 18 Fructidor, Villaret was sentenced to deportation to Cayenne; he went into hiding until the French Directory ordered those who had escaped deportation to Guyane exiled to the Île d&#x27;Oléron; then, Villaret willingly surrendered himself. He remained on Oléron until the advent of the French Consulate.

===Saint-Domingue expedition and Martinique===
In 1801, Bonaparte ended Villaret-Joyeuse&#x27;s exile and returned him to active command. Initially, Napoleon wanted Villaret-Joyeuse to prepare an expedition to capture the Cape of Good Hope, then head into the Indian Ocean. With the Peace of Amiens, Bonaparte decided to attempt to regain control of Haiti with the Saint-Domingue expedition. In December 1801, Villaret set out with ten French and five Spanish ships and nine frigates and corvettes, with his flag on the 120-gun , ferrying 7000 of General Leclerc&#x27;s expeditionary forces to Saint Domingue. Two further squadron, one from Lorient comprising one ship, two frigates and 1200 soldiers, and the other from Rochefort with six ships, six frigates, two corvettes and 3000 soldiers, joined his fleet off Brest. Conflicts over command led Villaret to return to France with the majority of the fleet.

In April 1802, Bonaparte appointed Villaret him &quot;Capitaine-General of Martinique and Sainte-Lucie&quot;. Taking control of Martinique in September in accordance with the Treaty of Amiens, he faced the threats of slave-uprisings, yellow fever and the possibility of invasion. On 3 November 1802, Villaret founded a 94-strong force of Gendarmerie at Martinique, and on 8 July 1803, a company of black Chasseurs Volontaires de la Martinique.

He cooperated with Admirals Missiessy and Villeneuve who sailed into the Caribbean in 1805 during the Trafalgar Campaign.

In January 1809, a British expedition invaded Martinique and laid siege to the fortress at Fort-de-France. After the British were able to bring up their heavy artillery, the month-long siege ended on 24 February with the surrender of Villaret.

Upon his return to France, Villaret&#x27;s conduct was condemned by an inquiry council; he requested in vain a Court-martial to clear his name, and he lived in disgrace for two years. Napoleon granted him a pardon in 1811: &quot;Bravery and fidelity plead in favour of the vice-admiral (...) did his faults lose the colony? At most, they shortened its keeping for a few days.&quot; As Napoleon prepared for the invasion of Russia, he appointed Villaret General governor of Venice in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, and commander of the 12th military division. Villaret retained this position until 24 July 1812, when he died of edema in Venice.

To honour him, Napoleon had his name engraved on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

==Legacy==
A number of legends have been reported as truths on Villaret-Joyeuse. He is often said to have come from a noble family; this appears to be false.

Another legend holds that he enlisted in the Gendarmes before joining the Navy; however, Villaret is listed on none of the lists of Gendarmes in the relevant years. Some authors further state that Villaret had to leave the Gendarmes after killing an opponent in a duel, either and the age of 16 or at the age of 18.

<doc id="224110" wikidata="Q3438452" url="?curid=224110" title="Bradley Foundation">
<text>The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, commonly known as the Bradley Foundation, is an American charitable foundation based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that has been one of the most influential funders of the conservative movement.

The foundation funds a variety of conservative groups along with cultural institutions and Milwaukee nonprofit organizations. It has been active in school choice and efforts to change election rules. Approximately 70% of the foundation&#x27;s giving is directed to national groups while 30% is Wisconsin-based, its CEO said in 2018. The foundation had about $850 million in assets as of 2021. It awards the Bradley Prize.

==History==

The foundation was established in 1942, shortly after the death of Lynde Bradley, to further the philosophy of the Bradley brothers. The Bradley brothers had helped found the Allen-Bradley Company, a major electrical controls manufacturer. The foundation&#x27;s credo is &quot;The good society is a free society.&quot;

In 1965, after the death of Harry Lynde Bradley, Lynde&#x27;s brother, the foundation expanded and began to concentrate on public policy. The 1985 acquisition of the Allen-Bradley Company by Rockwell International Corporation resulted in a portion of the proceeds going to expand the foundation, swelling its assets from $14 million to over $290 million. In 1986, the foundation gave away $23 million, more than it had in the previous four decades.

The Bradley Foundation&#x27;s former president, Michael S. Joyce, helped to create the Philanthropy Roundtable, a group of American philanthropists that, as of 2018, has 660 members (consisting of both individuals and organizations).

The Bradley Foundation acts like &quot;a venture capital fund for conservative ideas&quot;, in the words of the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; in 2011.

In the August 2021 &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine, Jane Mayer wrote that the Bradley Foundation &quot;has become an extraordinary force in persuading mainstream Republicans to support radical challenges to election rules—a tactic once relegated to the far right&quot; and &quot;funds a network of groups that have been stoking fear about election fraud, in some cases for years. Public records show that, since 2012, the foundation has spent some eighteen million dollars supporting eleven conservative groups involved in election issues.&quot; On the foundation&#x27;s board of directors is attorney Cleta Mitchell, who joined Donald Trump on his phone call on 2 January 2021 when Trump pressured Georgia election officials to find 11,780 votes to overturn the state&#x27;s 2020 presidential election results.

==Funding areas==
The foundation describes itself as supporting limited government. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Bradley Foundation as &quot;a leading source of ideas and financing for American conservatives.&quot; A 2013 report from the Center for Public Integrity found that the Bradley Foundation was a contributor to Donors Trust, a right-wing think tank which has been described as the &quot;dark money ATM&quot; for conservative billionaires, enabling them to make sizable donations to conservative causes without attracting public scrutiny.

In a 2018 interview, the foundation&#x27;s CEO, Richard Graber, described its four major areas of funding as &quot;constitutional order&quot;, education (in particular school choice), civil society, and arts and culture. In that interview, Graber said that the foundation would deemphasize some areas in which it had previously made grants, including national security and foreign policy. Activities in these areas had funded millions of dollars for three anti-Muslim groups: the David Horowitz Freedom Center (which received $4.2 million), Frank Gaffney&#x27;s Center for Security Policy (which received $815,000) and Daniel Pipes&#x27; Middle East Forum (which received $305,000). These grants were between 2008 and 2011. The foundation&#x27;s funding was criticized by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which described the grant recipients as an &quot;Islamophobic network.&quot;

The Bradley Foundation is a major funder of state-level initiatives opposing unions, particularly in Wisconsin.

Organizations awarded grants by the foundation have included the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), FreedomWorks, Americans for Prosperity, The Heritage Foundation, the Hoover Institution, the Black Alliance for Educational Options and the SEED Foundation. The associated Bradley Impact Fund in 2020 gave $6.5 million, its largest donation that year, to Project Veritas.

==Bradley Prize==
The Bradley Prize is a grant to &quot;formally recognize individuals of extraordinary talent and dedication who have made contributions of excellence in areas consistent with The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation&#x27;s mission.&quot; As many as four prizes of $250,000 each are awarded annually, often to right-wing opinion leaders. Winners have included Fouad Ajami (2006), John Bolton (2007), Martin Feldstein (2007), Victor Davis Hanson (2008), Leonard Leo (2009), William Kristol (2009), Paul A. Gigot (2010), Jeb Bush (2011), Edwin Meese III (2012), Roger Ailes (2013), Paul Clement (2013), Mitch Daniels (2013), Yuval Levin (2013), Kimberley Strassel (2014), Ayaan Hirsi Ali (2015), James Ceaser (2015), Gary Sinise (2016), Peter Berkowitz (2017), Charles R. Kesler (2018), Roger Kimball (2019), Amity Shlaes (2021), Glenn Loury (2022), John H. Cochrane (2023), and Jay Bhattacharya (2024).

The Bradley Prizes for 2020 were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

<doc id="224112" wikidata="Q112813" url="?curid=224112" title="Durango (city)">
<text>Durango (, ) is the capital and largest city of the northern Mexican state of Durango and the seat of the municipality of Durango. It has a population of 616,068 as of the 2020 census with 688,697 living in the municipality. The city&#x27;s official name is Victoria de Durango, renamed in honor of the first president of Mexico, Guadalupe Victoria, a native of the state of Durango. The city is at an altitude of in the Valley of Guadiana. 

Durango was founded on 8 July 1563, by the Spanish explorer Francisco de Ibarra. During the Spanish colonial era the city was the capital of the Nueva Vizcaya province of New Spain, which consisted mostly of what became the Mexican states of Durango and Chihuahua. The city was founded due to its proximity to the Cerro del Mercado, in the northern part of the modern city, which was believed to contain large amounts of silver. Eventually, an important iron deposit was discovered.

==History==
The town was named by Francisco de Ibarra after his hometown Durango in the Spanish province of Biscay. The name &quot;Durango&quot; is of Basque origin. Ibarra also named the surrounding area Nuevo Vizcaya (New Biscay). The official name of the city became Victoria de Durango in 1826, in honor of Guadalupe Victoria, the first president of Mexico and native of the state. The city&#x27;s coat-of-arms serves as the seal for the state.

Since the pre-historic period the area was a conduit for influences from north and south, between Aridoamerica and Mesoamerica. The first inhabitants of the area were a people called the Nahoas, nomads who came to the area from the north about 2,000 years ago. By the Post Classic period, the area became inhabited by the Zacatecans and the Tepehuanos, who migrated here from the north-west.

The modern city began as a mining town, officially founded as Villa de Durango by Francisco de Ibarra on 8 July 1563. Ibarra was sent north by Viceroy Luis de Velasco to conquer the territory and found the city. The site was chosen because of its proximity to the Cerro de Mercado, thought at the time to contain reserves of silver, but instead was found to be an important source of iron. The mountain was named for Captain Ginés Vázquez de Mercado, who discovered the valley on his expeditions in the north. The site was also chosen because it was close to the Franciscan mission at Analco, which was a source of water, wood, and animals to hunt. The initial layout of the town was done by Alonso de Pacheco, bordered by what became Madero and Constitución streets on running north–south, and by 5 February and 20 November running east–west. The historic center is located around the Plaza de Armas (main square) and the Cathedral Basilica.

Due to its distance from Mexico City, the city and the surrounding communities developed relatively autonomously. Some of the earliest missions in the north of the country are located in and around the city. It became an important stop on the road north to conquer what is now the north of Mexico and Southwest U.S. The Jesuits were also missionaries here from 1596 until their expulsion from New Spain in 1767. They founded the Colegio de Guadiana, which was the main educational institution for northern Mexico during the colonial period.

The town became a parish in 1620. It was officially named a city on 3 March 1630. Difficulties forced the near-abandonment of the city of Durango in the 17th century, with the provincial capital moving to Parral, but starting in 1680, the city began to grow again. This was because the mines in Parral had started to give out and the reduction in violence as the Spanish government succeeded in subduing the native peoples. The city regained its role as the province&#x27;s capital on 10 October 1738.

Durango provided peak influence during the 18th century because of the mining of various minerals in the nearby Sierra Madre Occidental. The bonanza allowed for the creation of several grand colonial-era buildings in the city center.

Various players in the War of Independence, including Miguel Hidalgo, were executed here on 17 July 1812. Their remains were buried at the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe.

In 1867, Benito Juárez stayed here while traveling north.

The city became an archdiocese on 23 June 1891.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the city of Durango remained the political center of the state and a regional commercial center for agricultural and handcrafted products. Mayors of the city concentrated on improving infrastructure, such as government buildings, hospitals, water supply lines, and public streets. The population grew.

In 1911, the city joined the Mexican Revolution under the leadership of the Arrieta brothers. Domingo Arrieta took the city, and the soldiers under the command of Victoriano Huerta rebelled against the government. The Revolution led to the loss of production of both haciendas and factories. On 18 June 1913, insurgents took the city and burned businesses. The war led to economic depression lasting decades. In 1917, Domingo Arrieta, loyal to Venustiano Carranza, became governor of the state.

The destruction of the city center led to development outside of it, with the first neighborhood, Colonia Obrera of 1918, to break the historical limits of the city as it was near an ice factory and the rail line. The establishment of new neighborhoods (&quot;colonias&quot;) continued in the 1930s along the rail lines. Efforts were made from this time to the 1960s to regulate this growth.

The population grew noticeably in the 1960s and 1970s mostly due to migration from rural areas, increasing urban sprawl to 1,058 hectares. One major factor of this growth was the droughts of this time on agricultural production as well as expectations of industrial development.

The history of filmmaking in Durango started in 1898 with a clip titled &quot;A train arriving in Durango&quot;. However, in the 1950s, commercial filmmaking began in the city and surrounding areas. Director Jack Smith discovered La Ferrería Hacienda and found the landscape perfect for Western films. The first movie shot here was &quot;White Feather&quot; by 20th Century Fox. Over the following decades various Hollywood and Mexican films were shot here, attracting various famous stars. These included Robert Wagner, Clark Gable, Charlton Heston, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Glenn Ford, Anthony Quinn, and especially John Wayne, who shot seven films and bought a ranch called La Joya. Film production continued into the 1970s and 1980s, with Mexican companies using the area. More recent stars to work here include John Cusack, Kevin Costner, Salma Hayek, Penélope Cruz, Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Brendan Fraser. Film production has diminished and the state has a director of cinematography to promote filmmaking. The main attraction for filmmakers is the variety of landscapes.

Population growth accelerated in the 1970s due to the city&#x27;s economic development including cinematic production, and economic decline in other parts of the state. Transportation infrastructure increased with the establishment of the airport. Industrial parks such as Durango and Gómez Palacio were established.

New efforts to regulate growth were initiated in the early 1980s, especially in zoning with limited success. Housing developments began during this time with urban sprawl reaching 5,368 hectares by 1992.

Urban development in the 1990s into the 2000s focused on road paving as well as traffic signals. Throughways such as the Anillo Periférica (Ring Road) were built in the 2000s and 2010s.

The city became a World Heritage Site in 2010, as part of the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. In the 2010s, many of the streetlights were replaced with those with LED lighting, to save costs and energy. In 2013, the city council voted unanimously to ban bullfighting in the municipality. In 2013, the city celebrated the 450th anniversary of its founding.

==Landmarks==
The city is noted for its colonial architecture, including Baroque, attesting to its relatively early colonization by the Spanish. The historic center contains the largest concentration of historic monuments in northern Mexico. The historic area of the city centers on the Cathedral and Plaza de Armas, with Paseo Constitución as the main pedestrian thoroughfare connecting the Hidalgo Garden in the north to the Paseo de las Alamedas in the south.

The Cathedral Basilica of Durango was founded as the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception in the early colonial period. It became the cathedral in 1621, but the building burned shortly thereafter in 1634. It was rebuilt in the middle of the 18th century at the height of the city&#x27;s mining prosperity, but only a quarter of the construction from that period remains. The church remains dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, which is depicted on the main altar. It also contains Byzantine vaults and a cupola with paintings of angels. Underneath the cathedral runs the Mining Tunnel, also known as the Cathedral Tunnel. It was a mining shaft which also doubled as a secret passage. Today, it is a museum.

The cathedral faces the city&#x27;s main square, which is called the Plaza de Armas, which was established with the official founding of the city. The center contains a kiosk made from pink sandstone. The kiosk contains a shop dedicated to selling handicrafts made by students of the School of Painting, Sculpture and Crafts.

There are several historically important churches in the city. The Guadalupe Sanctuary is located northwest of the historic center. It was constructed between 1653 and 1658 by Bishop Barrientos Lomelín originally as a guest house. The Remedios Church (Templo de los Remedios) is found on a hill of the same name overlooking the city from the west. It was built in 1640 and is one of the oldest churches in the state. Later churches include the San Agustin Church, which is Neoclassical with a rose window; Our Lady of Angels church, which was finished in 1897 featuring stonework by Benigno Montoya and the Sacred Heart Church built in Neo Romantic style.

The Regional Museum of Durango is located in the El Aguacate Building located on the corner of Victoria and Aquiles Serdán. This structure was built in French style which was popular at the end of the 19th century. The building originally was the residence of Francisco Gómez Palacio, who was governor of the state in 1880. It is in French style and has a garden with an avocado tree, which gives the building its nickname. The museum has twelve halls related to the history of the state and its natural resources. The permanent collection consists of over 1,000 objects, from the first cultures of Durango to modern times.

The State Government Palace is located in the former residence built by captain and miner Juan José Zambrano between 1790 and 1800. It acquired this function after the War of Independence.

More recent remodeling in 2010 saw the installation of the Francisco Villa Museum, Villa being a native of Durango. It was opened in part in homage to those who abandon their hometowns to migrate elsewhere, with a mural on this topic.

The Founders&#x27; Plaza (Plaza de los Fundadores) is located near the State Government Palace and next to the former Jesuit College. It marks the place where the city was officially founded, with a sculpted mural depicting the event. It also contains a Mirror Monument and a fountain where children play on hot days. The old Jesuit College is now the Central Building of the Universidad Juárez de Durango. The building was constructed in the 18th century, but the order was expelled from Mexico not long after. Since then it had several uses before becoming the university.

The Count Suchil House (Casa del Conde de Súchil) was constructed between 1761 and 1768 by Governor Agüero and then later purchased by José del Campo Soberón y Larrea, the first Count of the Vaelly of Suchil. The facade is Baroque and is attributed to the same architect who designed the sides of the cathedral.

Constructed between 1798 and 1800, the Victoria Theater is the oldest theatre in the north of Mexico. It was originally built as part of the Zambrano residence as the owner&#x27;s personal theater with the name of the Coliseo Theater. It inaugurated in 1800 with a play by Euripides. Later it was renamed the Main Theater (Teatro Principal). In 1908, it was bought by Jesús Ávila, who reconstructed it in 1909 adding ironwork, boxes and the four levels it now has. It gained its current name with the centennial of Mexico&#x27;s independence. The theater was used as a cinema from 1926 to 1978, when the Mary Street Foundation donated it to the state with the aim of returning it to theatrical use.

The City Museum (Museo de la Ciudad) was until recently the municipal government building. The structure was built in the 19th century, but contains many elements from the architecture of the previous century. It originally was called the Escárzaga Palace, the residence of mine owner Pedro Escárzaga Corral. The building is of lime and sandstone on the exterior walls with the interior paved with adobe and stone. The current tile floors are a recent addition. The roof is of reinforced concrete, which replaced the previous one made of packed earth and wood beams. Only the main terrace is left completely intact in its original condition. The building was a copy of a hotel in France. The building currently contains a mural of the city&#x27;s history done by Francisco Montoya de la Cruz in 1954.

Beef is the primary meat as it is culturally part of the north of the country. Cheese is an important ingredient, made in several small towns in the area. Cold winters and a history of no refrigeration prompted the development of food preservation techniques, including canning, jam, and other preserves, and dried foods such as jerky and chili peppers. Typical dishes include barbacoa, meat in mole sauce (which tend to be sweet), and caldillo Duranguense. Caldillo Durangueño was originally made with deer meat and green chili peppers (poblanos), but today is made with beef. Another popular dish is asado rojo, made with pork. However, the most emblematic dish is the gordita, where thick corn (sometimes flour) tortillas are split then stuffed with one of several different savory fillings. Its popularity stems from its historical role as a food taken into the fields to eat. Traditional sweets here are similar to those in other parts of Mexico, introduced by nuns from convents further south and include crystallized fruits and cajeta (dulce de leche). The most important alcoholic drink is mezcal as the state is one of several in the country with denomination of origin.

The ethnic composition of the city is 52% White, 44% Mestizo, 4% Arabs, and less than 1% Indigenous. The majority of Duranguenses, like many northern Mexicans, have European origins, with most of them being Criollos.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were small immigration waves to northern and central Mexico from Europe and the Middle East. Most immigrants to the city arrived from Spain (mainly from the Basque Country. There were also some waves from France, Italy, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

There were also immigration waves during World War II from Eastern Europe, (mainly Russians and Poles) and from the Balkans (especially from Macedonia and Montenegro). Romanians and Ukrainians arrived during the 1990s and most of them reside in immigrant ghettos in the inner city.

There are roughly 10,000 Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites living in the municipality of Durango. Durango also has recent retiree communities from Australia, the United States, and South Africa.

Many post-colonial Spanish immigrants were from Galicia (Galicians). The Galician language, cuisine and culture had a major presence in the city for most of the 20th century. In recent years, descendants of Galician immigrants have led a mini-boom in Celtic music.

The Arab and Armenian communities have had a significant presence in commerce and civic life since the beginning of the 20th century. Asians represent smaller communities and number about 1–2% of the city&#x27;s population; most of them are Japanese while smaller numbers are Chinese and Koreans, the latter known in the city for owning family-style supermarkets.

The city of Durango is the capital and economic center of a state that is mostly dependent on agriculture and livestock, with a high level of socioeconomic marginalization.

There have been efforts to develop a tourism industry here. Most visitors to the city visit the historic center, especially the cathedral, main plaza, the old railroad stations, parks and museums. Other attractions include haciendas, local natural areas and movie sets, some of which are now theme attractions. In 2010, the city built a suspended cable car similar to those found in Chihuahua and Zacatecas, which allows for panoramic views of the city as it climbs to the Cerro de los Remedios.

There are highways connecting the city to Zacatecas (and into the center of the country), Torreón to the north, Nayarit to the south and a new major highway west to Mazatlán. General Guadalupe Victoria Airport receives both national and international flights: six per day from Mexico City, one per day from Guadalajara, Tijuana and Monterrey as well as flights from Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, and Dallas/Fort Worth (beginning in June 2019) . However, only one airline, Aeroméxico, connects the city with the nation&#x27;s capital.

Though nothing like its heyday in the mid-to-late 20th century, the city and the surrounding area still attracts film projects, especially for works with a Western theme, with over 120 films shot here since the industry started. The area contains sets built for this purpose including Calle Howard, Western Village and Rancho Calderón, all with reproductions of wood buildings like those found in the Old West of the United States. The city proper has provided backdrops of Old Mexico. Several old sets have been converted into theme parks, including Chupaderos, Villas de Oeste and La Joya, John Wayne&#x27;s old ranch.

There are several bus lines, including Omnibus de Mexico, Mexico Omnibus Plus, Tourists Luxury, Executive Senda AVE, North Transport, Transport North Premier, Futura, Transport Chihuahuenses, Mexico Interstate Bus (ELITE).

<text>Gómez Palacio is a city and its surrounding municipality in northeastern Durango, Mexico, adjacent to the border of the state of Coahuila. The city is named in honor of former Durango governor, Francisco Gómez Palacio y Bravo.

As of 2010, the city of Gómez Palacio had a population of 327,985, up from 304,515 as of 2005, making it the state&#x27;s second-largest community. The municipality (including the city) population was 327,985. The municipality&#x27;s area is . The municipality and city are part of a large metropolitan area called the Comarca Lagunera Metropolitan Area, which includes Torreón Municipality and Matamoros Municipality in Coahuila, as well as Lerdo Municipality in Durango. The metropolitan area had an official population of 1,215,817 persons in 2010.

== History ==
From the first half of the seventeenth century, the land within the triangle formed by San Juan de Casta (now Leon Guzman), Santiago de Mapimí (Mapimí) and Santa Maria de las Parras (Parras), formed part of the property of the Marquis of Aguayo and named Hacienda de San Lorenzo de la Laguna.

In 1848, after several modifications, the lands were purchased by Juan Ignacio Jimenez, from Cuencame. The purchase included the entrance of the river Nazas (Cañon de Calabazas), where he built Calabazas Dam and a system of canals and ditches to irrigate the lands of the Haciendas of Sacramento, Noé, Santa Rosa, Torreón and San Ignacio.

In 1880, his successors sold these properties to one of his managers, Spanish farmer Santiago Lavín Cuadra. In 1885, Lavín drafted the blocks that would be the beginning of the city. He created a public square in Hidalgo Street (now Independencia) and offered free land to those who agreed to plant trees to give the region a different look. The first deed was recorded September 15, 1885, now considered the city&#x27;s founding date. Lavín named the town in honor of Francisco Gomez Palacio for his many achievements as governor, federal deputy, Secretary of the Interior and as an official in the government of Benito Juárez.

The city was officially recognized by the State Congress December 21, 1905, by decree number 60.

== Early industries ==
On June 25, 1887, a legal society was formed that gave rise to &quot;La Jabonera&quot; (The Soap), considered the city&#x27;s most important industry. Another company was the spinning and weaving &quot;La Amistad&quot; (Friendship) that received a land grant to set up their factory. Another was &quot;La Union&quot; (The Union), a shoe factory that became successful enough to compete with imported European and U.S. premium brands.

== Economy ==
Upon founding the city, Cuadra ceded land to the Mexican Central Railroad so that it could build a roundhouse and workshops, with the aim of expanding it to an entire railroad terminal. In 1907, a U.S. company transferred its Jimulco facilities to Gómez Palacio and terminals for passenger and cargo trains were established. Over time, about 2,000 workers arrived. The trains were operated by U.S. personnel, who gradually trained Mexican workers to operate the trains. Mexican workers occupied vacancies left by departing Americans and by 1910, all positions were filled by Mexicans.
The city became one of the largest railroad centers in the country, boosting the already thriving development. The outbreak of the revolutionary struggle caused the closure of many industries and businesses, especially affecting manual laborers. For many years, the railroad was the mainstay of the local economy. The roundhouse, workshops and terminals were changed to Torreon, Coahuila.

The installation of the Francke power plant in 1930 gave considerable impetus to industrialization.

The first agricultural strike in the region occurred June 11, 1935, in the Hacienda of Manila, multiplying effects in other estates that resulted in the issuance of the decree of October 6, 1936, by which General Lázaro Cárdenas initiated the distribution of land to laborers throughout the Comarca Lagunera.

As the busiest economy in the region and state, the city contributed nearly 45% of GDP along with Ciudad Lerdo and over 55% with Laguna Region of Durango. Gómez Palacio hosts several industrial parks, including the newer Park Gómez Palacio Americas, Harrier Industrial Park with 588 companies and the Zone of International Connectivity, Laguna for international trade.

== Notable people ==

Manuel Banuelos, a pitcher for four Major League Baseball teams, was born in Gomez Palacio. 

Uriel Antuna, footballer

Andrade El Idolo, professional wrestler

== Sister City ==
Gómez Palacio has one sister city.:
* - South El Monte, California, USA

<text>The Iyonix PC was an Acorn-clone personal computer sold by Castle Technology and Iyonix Ltd between 2002 and 2008. According to news site &quot;Slashdot&quot;, it was the first personal computer to use Intel&#x27;s XScale processor. It ran .

== History ==

The Iyonix originated as a secret project by Pace engineers in connection with development of set-top boxes (STBs), and has been noted as a successor to the . Pace had a licence to develop RISCOS Ltd&#x27;s OS sources for use in the STB market. The Iyonix was developed under the code name &quot;Tungsten&quot; and uses , which is a version of RISC OS that supports ARM CPUs with 32-bit addressing modes. The sources and hardware design were subsequently acquired by Castle, who developed them into the final product. Castle continued to keep the project a secret, requiring developers to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Information was distributed to such developers via a confidential section of the website. Customers were occasionally able to buy the computer as a bare bones system for self-assembly.

After speculation on the usenet newsgroups, a website for the hardware was spotted in mid October 2002. Units first went on sale in December 2002. Prices started from £1249.

Castle ceased production of the Iyonix after the July 2006 introduction in the UK of the RoHS Regulations. The design was not compliant and Castle did not redesign the Iyonix. Sales continued for another two years via a newly established company, Iyonix Ltd, which enabled Castle itself to circumvent the regulations.

On 25 September 2008, Castle announced that production of the Iyonix had ceased and that new units would no longer be available to order.

== Features ==
Features include:
* Standard ATX motherboard and Nvidia video card
* Intel XScale 80321 600 MHz 32-bit processor
* Two 64-bit and two 32-bit PCI slots (two occupied by graphics and USB cards, two free)
* RISC OS version 5 in hardware ROM module, using 32-bit addressing mode.
* Support for the Linux operating system
* Support for &quot;legacy&quot; Acorn DEBI expansion cards
* USB interfacing

It was the first time substantial changes had been made to the platform since the release of the Risc PC in 1994. All interim machines had been built on the ARM7500 system on a chip, which was widely regarded as a single-chip Risc PC. (It incorporated the memory controller, video, sound, IO and CPU logic of a Risc PC, leaving only memory and disc interfacing to be added.)

The presence of PCI and USB capabilities, as well as the retained &quot;podule&quot; bus, attracted comparisons to Acorn&#x27;s aborted Phoebe PC; however, such comparisons should be tempered with Phoebe&#x27;s proposed feature set, which retained VIDC and 26-bit mode, and although Phoebe was intended to be capable of SMP configurations, its proposed shipping configuration had been for one SA110 CPU.

<text>John Opie (16 May 1761 – 9 April 1807) was an English historical and portrait painter. He painted many great men and women of his day, including members of the British Royal Family, and others who were notable in the artistic and literary professions.

==Life and work==

Opie was born in Harmony Cottage, Trevellas, between St Agnes and Perranporth in Cornwall, UK. He was the youngest of the five children of Edward Opie, a master carpenter, and his wife Mary (née Tonkin). He showed a precocious talent for drawing and mathematics, and by the age of twelve, he had mastered Euclid and opened an evening school for poor children where he taught reading, writing, and arithmetic. His father, however, did not encourage his abilities, and apprenticed him to his own trade of carpentry.

Opie&#x27;s artistic abilities eventually came to the attention of local physician and satirist, Dr John Wolcot (Peter Pindar), who visited him at the sawmill where he was working in 1775. Recognising a great talent, Wolcot became Opie&#x27;s mentor, buying him out of his apprenticeship and insisting that he come to live at his home in Truro. Wolcot provided invaluable encouragement, advice, tuition and practical help in the advancement of his early career, including obtaining many commissions for work.

===London===
In 1781, having gained considerable experience as a portraitist travelling around Cornwall, Opie moved to London with Wolcot. There they lived together, having entered into a formal profit-sharing agreement. Although Opie had received a considerable artistic education from Wolcot, the doctor chose to present him as a self-taught prodigy; a portrait of a boy shown at the Society of Artists the previous year, had been described in the catalogue as &quot;an instance of Genius, not having ever seen a picture.&quot; Wolcot introduced the &quot;Cornish wonder&quot; to leading artists, including Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was to compare him to Caravaggio and Velazquez, and to prospective patrons. The business arrangement with Wolcot lasted for a year, after which Opie informed the doctor that he now wished to go it alone, leading to the estrangement of the two former partners.

Through the influence of &quot;a Mrs Boscawen&quot;, Wolcot managed to have Opie introduced at the court of King George III. The king purchased one of his pictures and commissioned him to produce a portrait of Mary Delany. He also received commissions to paint Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, both the nephew and son-in-law of King George III. Opie also painted the portraits of Lady Salisbury, Lady Charlotte Talbot, Lady Harcourt and other ladies of the court. Opie&#x27;s residence at &quot;Orange Court&quot;, Castle Street, Leicester Fields, was said to be &quot;crowded with rank and fashion every day&quot; and he was the talk of the town. In 1782 he first exhibited at the Royal Academy and in December of that year was married to Mary Bunn. The match, however, proved to be an unhappy one and they were eventually divorced in 1796 after her elopement.

In 1799, Opie painted (oils) a portrait of Charlotte, Princess Royal, daughter of George III. 

Although socially reticent, Opie was part of the &quot;Strawberry Hill Set&quot;, the Gothick villa owned by Horace Walpole who would play host to the Blue Stockings Society. Opie painted many of the society&#x27;s members including Mary Delany, Henry Fuseli, Hannah More, Samuel Johnson, Mary Wollstonecraft and, later on in his career, his own wife Amelia who was associated with the society. 
After the initial burst of popularity, Opie&#x27;s style rapidly fell out of fashion. In response to this he began to work on improving his technique, while at the same time seeking to supplement his early education by the study of Latin, French and English literature, and to polish his provincial manners by mixing in cultivated and learned circles. 

In 1786 he exhibited his first important historical subject, the &quot;Assassination of James I&quot;, and in the following year the &quot;Murder of Rizzio&quot;, a work whose merit was recognized by his immediate election as associate of the Royal Academy, of which he became a full member in 1788. He painted five subjects for John Boydell&#x27;s Shakespeare Gallery; and until his death, his practice alternated between portraiture and historical work. In May 1798 he married Amelia Alderson whom he had met at parties in Norwich, including one at Holkham Hall where he had gone to carry out some commissions for Holkham&#x27;s owner, Thomas Coke. The commission included doing portraits of Coke&#x27;s Whig friends. John and Amelia lived at 8 Berners Street, London where Opie had moved in 1791. This proved a happy marriage, lasting for Opie&#x27;s last nine years of life.

Opie painted many notable men and women including Mary Wollstonecraft, Samuel Johnson, Francesco Bartolozzi, John Bannister, Joseph Munden, Charles James Fox, William Betty, Edmund Burke, John Crome, James Northcote, Henry Fuseli, Thomas Girtin, Robert Southey, Samuel Parr, Elizabeth Inchbald and Mary Shelley; 508 portraits in all, mostly in oil, and 252 other pictures. Opie painted the portrait of Captain Mark Oates whom he had seen paint a butterfly when both men were young. Opie painted the portrait of George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend who, in February 1792 became Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk - the county from which Opie&#x27;s wife hailed.

Jane Beetham Read was the only female student that Opie ever taught. He painted her portrait between 1790 and 1800, and asked for her hand in marriage around 1796, but her father rejected the marriage.

==Teaching and writing==
In 1805, Opie was appointed a professor at the Royal Academy and from May 1806 gave a series of four lectures which were published as a book after his death, with a memoir by his widow Amelia Opie, in 1809. His students at the academy included Henry Thomson. Opie was also known as a writer on art by his &quot;Life of Reynolds&quot; in Wolcot&#x27;s edition of Matthew Pilkington&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Painters&quot; and his &quot;Letter on the Cultivation of the Fine Arts in England&quot;, in which he advocated the formation of a national gallery.

==Death==
Opie died in April 1807, aged 45, at his home in Berners Street, and was buried at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, in the crypt next to Joshua Reynolds, as he had wished. Royal etiquete allowed for Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester to follow the Opie funeral procession in his carriages to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Opie&#x27;s last portrait was of the Prince with whom Opie&#x27;s wife, Amelia, shared a great interest in Abolitionism. Amongst the mourners at Opie&#x27;s funeral were Sir Thomas Lawrence, J.M.W. Turner, Peter Finch Martineau and Henry Bone. Opie had no children.

<text>Amelia Opie (born Amelia Alderson; 12 November 1769 – 2 December 1853) was an English author and abolitionist who published numerous novels in the Romantic period up to 1828. A Whig supporter and Bluestocking, Opie was also a leading abolitionist in Norwich. Hers was the first of 187,000 names presented to the British Parliament on a petition from women to stop slavery.

==Early life and influences==
Amelia Alderson was born on 12 November 1769. An only child, she was the daughter of James Alderson, a physician, and Amelia Briggs of Norwich. Her mother also brought her up to care for those who came from less privileged backgrounds. After her mother&#x27;s death on 31 December 1784, she became her father&#x27;s housekeeper and hostess, remaining very close to him until his death in 1807.

According to her biographer, Opie &quot;was vivacious, attractive, interested in fine clothes, educated in genteel accomplishments, and had several admirers.&quot; She was able to speak French, having learnt from John Bruckner. She was a cousin of the judge Sir Edward Hall Alderson, with whom she corresponded throughout her life, and was also a cousin of the artist Henry Perronet Briggs. Alderson inherited radical principles and was an ardent admirer of John Horne Tooke. She was close to activists John Philip Kemble, Sarah Siddons, William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Along with Wollstonecraft, she was connected with the Blue Stockings Society.

==Career and connections==

Opie spent her youth writing poetry and plays and organizing amateur theatricals. She wrote &quot;The Dangers of Coquetry&quot; when she was 18 years old and by 1800 her &quot;songs&quot; (poems) - along with those of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, Mrs Barbauld, Peter Pindar and R.B. Sheridan - were published and advertised widely throughout England.

Between the years 1790-1834, Opie had written 13 different works. In 1801, Opie&#x27;s most famous novel was completed and titled &quot;Father and Daughter&quot;. Characterized as showing genuine fancy and pathos, the novel is about misled virtue and family reconciliation. After it came out, Opie began to publish regularly. Her volume of &quot;Poems&quot;, published in 1802, went through six editions. Encouraged by her husband to continue writing, she published &quot;Adeline Mowbray&quot; (1804), an exploration of women&#x27;s education, marriage, and the abolition of slavery. This novel in particular is noted for engaging the history of Opie&#x27;s former friend Mary Wollstonecraft, whose relationship with the American Gilbert Imlay outside of marriage caused some scandal, as did her later marriage to the philosopher William Godwin. Godwin had previously argued against marriage as an institution by which women were owned as property, but when Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they married despite his prior beliefs. In the novel, Adeline becomes involved with a philosopher early on, who takes a firm stand against marriage, only to be convinced to marry a West Indian landowner against her better judgement. The novel also engages abolitionist sentiment, in the story of a mixed-race woman and her family, whom Adeline saves from poverty at some expense to herself.

More novels followed: &quot;Simple Tales&quot; (1806), &quot;Temper&quot; (1812), &quot;Tales of Real Life&quot; (1813), &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Eve&quot; (1816), &quot;Tales of the Heart&quot; (1818), and &quot;Madeline&quot; (1822). &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Return and other poems&quot; was published in 1808.

In 1825, Opie joined the Society of Friends, due to the influence of Joseph John Gurney and his sisters, who were long-time friends and neighbours in Norwich, and despite the objections made by her recently deceased father. Opie had long known the Gurneys of Earlham Hall, Norfolk. Likewise, her future husband, artist John Opie, was &quot;an intimate associate of the family&quot; (having painted members of them) and met Amelia at Earlham in 1797. Amelia had been a friend of the Gurney sisters for many years. Alongside Amelia, Prince William Frederick had also been a guest at numerous balls and parties held at Earlham where the guests - both &quot;old and young&quot; - enjoyed &quot;standing around his Princeship and singing - which pleased him amazingly&quot;. Harriet Martineau recalled her family&#x27;s memories of the Gurney girls at this time &quot;dressing in gay riding boots, and riding about the country to balls and gaieties of all sorts.&quot;

In 1809, Opie published a biography on her husband John which accompanied the lectures he had given at the Royal Academy of Arts prior to his death in 1807. Her subscribers included Prince William Frederick and members of the Taylor, Gurney and Martineau families, all of whom were connected to Norwich, as was Amelia. Her friendship with the Duke of Gloucester remained firm; she stated &quot;...he seemed so glad to see me&quot; when reunited with him at the &quot;African Meeting&quot; at London&#x27;s Freemasons&#x27; Tavern.

The rest of Opie&#x27;s life was spent mostly in travel and working with charities. Meanwhile, she published an anti-slavery poem titled, &quot;The Black Man&#x27;s Lament&quot; in 1826 and a volume of devotional poems, &quot;Lays for the Dead&quot; in 1834. Opie worked with Anna Gurney to create a Ladies Anti-Slavery Society in Norwich. This anti-slavery society organised a petition of 187,000 names that was presented to parliament. The first two names on the petition were Amelia Opie and Priscilla Buxton. Opie went to the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840 where she was one of the few women included in the commemorative painting.

==Personal life==
On 8 May 1798 she married artist John Opie at the Church of St Marylebone, Westminster, London. She had met Opie at a parties and balls in London and in Norfolk including at Holkham Hall where he had come to carry out some commissions for Thomas Coke. They lived at 8 Berners Street, London where Opie had moved in 1791. The couple spent nine years happily married, although her husband did not share her love of society, until his death in 1807. She divided her time between London and Norwich. She was a friend of writers Walter Scott, Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Germaine de Staël. Opie&#x27;s concern for the well-being of writers is evident in a letter dated 12 December 1800 in which she wishes to hear from Susannah Taylor about the death of Dame Sarah Martineau whom Opie had met through their mutual friend Anna Laetitia Barbauld.

Even late in life, Opie maintained an interest and connections with writers, for instance receiving George Borrow as a guest. After a visit to Cromer, a seaside resort on the North Norfolk coast, she caught a chill and retired to her bedroom. A year later on 2 December 1853, she died at Norwich and was said to have retained her vivacity to the last. She was buried at the Gildencroft Quaker Cemetery, Norwich.

A somewhat sanitised biography of Opie, entitled &quot;A Life&quot;, by Cecilia Lucy Brightwell, was published in 1854.

One of her husband&#x27;s portraits of her was copied by his friend Henry Bone who created an enamel portrait miniature of her &quot;in 1798 or after&quot;. Bone&#x27;s drawing for the miniature is held in London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery.

<text>Paderborn (; Westphalian: &quot;Patterbuorn&quot;, also &quot;Paterboärn&quot;) is a city in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, capital of the Paderborn district. The name of the city derives from the river Pader and &quot;Born&quot;, an old German term for the source of a river. The river Pader originates in more than 200 springs near Paderborn Cathedral, where St. Liborius is buried.

Paderborn ranks 55th on the List of cities in Germany by population.

==History==
Paderborn was founded as a bishopric by Charlemagne in 795, although its official history began in 777 when Charlemagne built a castle near the Paderborn springs. In 799 Pope Leo III fled his enemies in Rome and reached Paderborn, where he met Charlemagne, and stayed there for three months. It was during this time that it was decided that Charlemagne would be crowned emperor. Charlemagne reinstated Leo in Rome in 800 and was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor by Leo in return. In 836, St. Liborius became the patron saint of Paderborn after his bones were moved there from Le Mans by Bishop Badurad. St. Liborius is commemorated in Paderborn every year in July with the Liborifest. The bishop of Paderborn, Meinwerk, became a Prince of the Empire in 1100. The bishop had several large buildings built, and the area became a place for the emperors to stay. 

The city was taken by Prussia in 1802, then by the French vassal state Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813 and then returned to Prussia.

After the city was reconstructed in the 1940s and 1950s, Paderborn became a major industrial seat in Westphalia. The British Army retained a significant presence in the area until 2020, when British units were relocated back to the United Kingdom. Only a small training and enabling staff remain at Paderborn to facilitate temporary deployments to use the Sennelager Training Area.

<text>Xico is a city in the State of Mexico, Mexico. It serves as the municipal seat of Valle de Chalco municipality, with which it is, for all practical purposes, coterminous. The municipality lies adjacent to the east side of the Federal District (Distrito Federal) and is part of the Mexico City metropolitan area. The city and municipality lie on the old lakebed of Lake Chalco, which was drained like much of the Basin of Mexico. The city name comes from the nearby Xico hill (Cerro de Xico) and the name of the municipality comes from the old lake plus a reference to the &quot;Programa Nacional de Solidaridad&quot; (National Program of Solidarity) which was initiated here. The municipality&#x27;s glyph and shield make reference to both names. It is a distinct entity from the city and municipality of Chalco, which is nearby. &quot;Chalco&quot; in both names refers to the Chalca tribe that were one of the original inhabitants of the area.

==The city==

Early pre-Hispanic history refers to the area around the Cerro de Xico as the Island of Xico as most of the modern city was underwater until relatively recently. The area was mostly fishing villages from 900 BC to 100 AD. However, from 550 to 650, the area was dominated by the Teotihuacan culture. From 650 to 750, an Otomi settlement gained prominence. The Acxotecas arrived around 1328, the same time that chinampa farming began here. Xico was conquered by the Aztec Tezozomoc in 1381, after which groups of Mexicas settle here extending the chinampa farming system in the 14th and 15th centuries. The area was ceded to Hernán Cortés by the Spanish king in 1529. The modern area began in the 19th century when Porfirio Díaz ordered the draining of Lake Chalco which devastated the economies of the former coastline communities. The Mexican Revolution tried to compensate these communities by the creation of ejidos, the two largest here being Estación Xico with 507 hectares and San Miguel Xico with 250 hectares. These ejidos, as well as the present-day city and municipality, rest almost entirely on former lakebed.

For the most part, the area laid barren until the late 1970s, when there was a sudden influx of families coming from the central and southern parts of Mexico in search of land. Despite its proximity, there was no infrastructure for basic services including schooling for children. Many people bought ejido land causing legal problems. The federal government had to step in to install basic services and regularize the property rights of more than 77,000 parcels of ejido land that was sold. However, the area did not become a separate municipality until 1994. In the census of 2005 the population of Xico was 331,321 people.

The only notable sites in the area are The Cerro del Marqués which contains architecture and archeological remains but these are not open to the public. However, there is the Museo Comunitario (Community Museum) which displays local archeological finds located in the Casa de Cultura “Chalchiuhtlicue”. There is also the Ex – Hacienda de Xico which was constructed at the same time the lake was drained.

==The municipality==

As municipal seat, Xico has governing jurisdiction over the following communities: Las Bombas, Comalchica, Santa Cruz, El Triángulo, El Invernadero, Colonia Ampliación (San Miguel Tláhuac), and Ejido Tulyehualco (Tabla Número Nueve) as well as 13 unnamed communities. It has a total population of 332,279.

The municipality borders the municipalities of Ixtapaluca, Chicoloapan, Los Reyes Acaquilpan, al oriente con Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias and borders to the south with the Distrito Federal (Delegaciones Iztapalapa y Tláhuac). It covers a total surface area of .

<text>The Phoebe 2100 (or ) was to be Acorn Computers&#x27; successor to the RiscPC, slated for release in late 1998. However, in September 1998, Acorn cancelled the project as part of a restructuring of the company.

==Specification==

Processors running at 300 MHz were being sampled by Acorn in September 1998, with 360 MHz versions also expected.

==Development==
In November 1996, the design of what was to become Phoebe 2100 was started. The design took into account a number of perceived weaknesses of the RiscPC design, a slow memory architecture, limited I/O capability, limited expansion, and not adhering to industry standards. To overcome these weakness a number of design objectives were created: harness the full potential of the StrongARM CPU, support multiple processors, add support for PCI expansion, offer the best possible graphics, run existing RISC OS applications, and provide enhanced RISC OS functionality. An additional design objective of reusing the same case as the RiscPC was dropped due to power supply requirements and electrical interference problems.

To provide for these new capabilities Acorn had to design two new support chips for the system;

* VIDC20R, a new revision of the VIDC20 video chip used in the RiscPC. Using a shrink of the process to 0.6 μm, a 100% performance increase was gained. Due to this being logically the same chip as the previous generation there would be no issues with software compatibility.
* IOMD2, the new IO chip had to support multiple processors, included message passing and multiple bus mastering, and was manufactured using a 0.35 μm process. Throughout development and prototyping the IOMD2 were developed on a large FPGA.

During 1997 and 1998, Acorn regularly took prototype and mock-up hardware to various Acorn computer shows, including Acorn World October 1997, Wakefield Acorn Spring Show May 1998 and the Acorn Southeast Show June 1998.

By May 1998, Acorn started to offer their &#x27;Registered Developer&#x27; scheme members the chance to pre-order a pre-launch prototype for testing and development, these were offered at a £950 (excl. VAT) a significant discount on the public price of £1500 (ex VAT) revealed in June.

On 15 September 1998, the first Phoebe 2100 motherboards with silicon (rather than FPGA) based IOMD2 chips were powered up. They successfully ran at the full front-side bus speed of 64 MHz, and the improved performance of the video chip was also seen; however, various bugs in the sound DMA were reported and general system instability was noted. As such, no shippable prototypes were yet available to send to the &#x27;Registered Developers&#x27;.

Two days later, on 17 September 1998, the development of Phoebe 2100 was cancelled.

Development was expected to cost £2.1 million.

==Operating system==
During the years following the release of the RiscPC, Acorn had discussed using an alternative to RISC OS as their next operating system, using TAOS or writing their own microkernel-based operating system Galileo. However, for the launch of Phoebe 2100 an enhanced version of RISC OS would be developed, called RISC OS 4 (codenamed &#x27;Ursula&#x27;). RISC OS wouldn&#x27;t support the multiple processor daughter cards that had been included in the Phoebe 2100 hardware specification.

RISC OS 4 had to support the new hardware of Phoebe 2100 which wasn&#x27;t present in Acorn&#x27;s earlier machines;

* PCI expansion slots
* Support for multiple serial ports
* The PC style game port, supporting joystick and MIDI

In addition several new features were to be added to the core of RISC OS;

* A better file system, increasing the number of items in directory from 77 to approx 88,000 and increasing the max length of a filename from 10 characters to 255
* A plugin based system configuration utility.
* A new screensaver API
* An enhanced window manager
* An updated interactive help application
* A redesigned set of icons

To prepare developers for the changes to the OS, Acorn released to its &#x27;Registered Developer&#x27; program RISC OS 3.80, designed to load on Acorn&#x27;s previous generation RiscPC and A7000 computers. This would enable developers to test that their software would be compatible with Phoebe 2100, provided it didn&#x27;t require any of the new hardware features. RISC OS 3.80 was limited, it only ran on ARM6 and ARM7 RiscPCs and not StrongARM (ARMv4) based ones. Testing of hardware compatibility would have to wait until an initial run of 100 or so pre-production machines was made available to Registered Developers.

==Code names==
The Phoebe 2100 project used a series of names inspired by characters from the TV series &#x27;Friends&#x27; as code names for the components.

* Phoebe – the machine itself, name carried over to launch title Phoebe 2100
* Ursula – the operating system, RISC OS 4, that it was to run
* Chandler – the IOMD2 chip
* Rachel – processor card
* Monica – PCI bridge

==Cancellation==
On 17 September 1998, Acorn finished a review of its business and decided to close the &#x27;Workstation Division&#x27;, the department developing Phoebe 2100, and all work stopped.

Acorn Computers&#x27; CEO Stan Boland said, &quot;There is not a big enough market for the PC (Risc PC 2), which is largely for home use and games. It&#x27;s an enthusiast&#x27;s product. We are going to resize the rest of the company and concentrate on becoming a digital TV and thin client company&quot;. Computerworld Online News reported an Acorn spokesman saying &quot;The problem was that it would have had a retail cost about twice as high as for a comparable PC&quot;.

After cancellation it came to light that as few as 150 to 300 pre-orders had been placed.

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of the cancellation of Phoebe 2100 and Acorn Computers&#x27; change in direction from general computing to set-top box development and DSP silicon design there were several attempts to resurrect some or all of the Phoebe 2100 hardware or RISC OS 4 development.

Of these, the only successful group was the Steering Group who, after initially being interested in releasing the Phoebe 2100, realised it would be financially prohibitive and set about creating a new company RISCOS Ltd. In March 1999, RISCOS Ltd negotiated a licence with Element 14, the recently renamed Acorn Computers, and set about finishing the development of RISC OS 4. In July 1999 RISCOS Ltd launched RISC OS 4 to the public. It supported Acorn&#x27;s RiscPC and A7000/+ machines.

In addition, after the cancellation, excess stock of the Phoebe 2100 yellow NLX case was sold by CTA Direct, sometimes including an NLX-compatible PC.

The only known working Phoebe 2100 is held in the collection of The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge, England.

<text>James Northcote (22 October 1746 – 13 July 1831) was a British painter. He became a member of the Royal Academy in 1787, and a member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1809.

==Life and work==

Northcote was born in Plymouth, and was apprenticed to his father, Samuel Northcote, a watchmaker. In his spare time, he drew and painted. In 1769 he left his father&#x27;s work and set up as a portrait painter. Four years later he went to London and was admitted as a pupil into the studio and house of Sir Joshua Reynolds. At the same time he attended the Royal Academy Schools.

In May 1776, he left Reynolds&#x27; studio, and about two years later, having made some money by portrait painting back in Devon, he went to study in Italy. On his return to England, three years later, he revisited his native county, then settled in London, where John Opie and Henry Fuseli were his rivals. He was elected associate of the Academy in 1786, and full academician in the following spring. The &quot;Young Princes Murdered in the Tower&quot;, his first important work on a historical subject, dates from 1786, and it was followed by the &quot;Burial of the Princes in the Tower&quot;. Both paintings, along with seven others, were intended for Boydell&#x27;s Shakespeare Gallery. His enormous &quot;Death of Wat Tyler&quot; was exhibited in 1787; commissioned by a London alderman, it hung in the Guildhall until its destruction during the Second World War.

Shortly afterwards Northcote began a set of ten subjects, entitled &quot;The Modest Girl and the Wanton&quot;, which were completed and engraved in 1796. Among the productions of Northcote&#x27;s later years are the &quot;Entombment&quot; and the &quot;Agony in the Garden&quot;, besides many portraits, and several animal subjects, such as &quot;Leopards&quot;, &quot;Dog and Heron&quot;, and &quot;Lion&quot;; these were more successful than the artist&#x27;s attempts at more elevated subjects, as was indicated by Fuseli&#x27;s caustic remark on examining the &quot;Angel opposing Balaam&quot; —&quot;Northcote, you are an angel at an ass, but an ass at an angel.&quot; Northcote&#x27;s works number about 2000, and he made a fortune of £40,000.

He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1787. He became a corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1809. His &quot;Portrait of Marc Isambard Brunel&quot; was exhibited at the Royal Academy&#x27;s Summer Exhibition in 1814 and is now in the National Portrait Gallery. He sponsored the admission in 1829 of Thomas Sewell Robins to the Royal Academy Schools.

In 1841, a monument to Northcote by Francis Chantrey was erected in Exeter Cathedral.
==Writings==
Northcote also sought fame as an author, and his first essays were contributions to the &quot;Artist&quot;, edited by Prince Hoare. In 1813 he embodied his recollections of his old master in a biography &quot;Memoirs of Sir Joshua Reynolds&quot;. His &quot;Fables&quot;—the first series published in 1828, the second posthumously in 1833—were illustrated with woodcuts by Harvey from Northcote&#x27;s own designs. In the production of his &quot;Life of Titian&quot;, his last work, which appeared in 1830, he was assisted by William Hazlitt, who previously, in 1826, had given to the public in the &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot; his recollections of Northcote&#x27;s pungent and cynical &quot;conversations&quot;, causing some problems for the painter and his friends.

<text>The United States Public Health Service (USPHS or PHS) is a collection of agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services concerned with public health, containing nine out of the department&#x27;s twelve operating divisions. The Assistant Secretary for Health oversees the PHS. The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC) is the federal uniformed service of the PHS, and is one of the eight uniformed services of the United States.

PHS had its origins in the system of marine hospitals that originated in 1798. In 1871 these were consolidated into the Marine Hospital Service, and shortly afterwards the position of Surgeon General and the PHSCC were established. As the system&#x27;s scope grew to include quarantine authority and research, it was renamed the Public Health Service in 1912. 

A series of reorganizations in 1966–1973 began a shift where PHS&#x27; divisions were promoted into departmental operating agencies. PHS was established as a thin layer of hierarchy above them rather than an operating agency in its own right. 

In 1995, PHS agencies were shifted to report directly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services rather the Assistant Secretary for Health, eliminating PHS as an administrative level in the organizational hierarchy.

== Organization ==
Ten of the thirteen operating agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are designated as part of the Public Health Service:
* National Institutes of Health
* Food and Drug Administration
* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
* Health Resources and Services Administration
* Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
* Indian Health Service
* Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
* Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
* Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response
* Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health
The other three agencies are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Administration for Children and Families, and Administration for Community Living.

The Public Health Service also encompasses two staff offices:
* Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health
* Office of Global Affairs

===United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps===

The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC) employs more than 6,000 uniformed public health professionals for the purpose of delivering public health promotion and disease prevention programs, and advancing public health science.

The mission of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is to protect, promote, and advance the health and safety of the people of the United States. According to the PHSCC, this mission is achieved through rapid and effective response to public health needs, leadership and excellence in public health practices, and advancement of public health science.

As one of the United States eight uniformed services, the PHS Commissioned Corps fills public health leadership and service roles within federal government agencies and programs. The PHSCC includes officers drawn from many professions, including environmental and occupational health, medicine, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, psychology, social work, hospital administration, health record administration, nutrition, engineering, science, veterinary, health information technology, and other health-related occupations.

Officers of the Corps wear uniforms similar to those of the United States Navy with special PHSCC insignia, and the Corps uses the same commissioned officer ranks as the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps from ensign to admiral, uniformed services pay grades O-1 through O-10 respectively.

According to , service in the PHSCC after June 30, 1960, is considered military service for retirement purposes. Under , active service in the PHSCC is considered active military service for the purposes of most veterans&#x27; benefits and for antidiscrimination laws.

== History ==

Modern public health began developing in the 19th century, as a response to advances in science that led to the understanding of the source and spread of disease. As the knowledge of contagious diseases increased, means to control them and prevent infection were soon developed. Once it became understood that these strategies would require community-wide participation, disease control began being viewed as a public responsibility. Various organizations and agencies were then created to implement these disease preventing strategies. As the U.S. expanded, the scope of the governmental health agency expanded. Most of the Public health activity in the United States took place at the municipal level before the mid-20th century. There was some activity at the national and state level as well.

=== Marine Hospital Service ===

In the administration of the second president of the United States John Adams, Congress authorized the creation of hospitals for mariners through the 1798 Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen. They were initially located along the East Coast, and as the boundaries of the United States expanded, so too were marine hospitals. The Marine Hospital Service was placed under the Revenue Marine Service (a forerunner of the present-day Coast Guard) within the Department of the Treasury.

A reorganization in 1871 converted the loose network of locally controlled marine hospitals into a centrally controlled Marine Hospital Service, with its headquarters in Washington, D.C. This reorganization established the Marine Hospital Service as its own bureau within the Department of the Treasury. The position of Supervising Surgeon (later titled the Surgeon General) was created to administer the Service, and John Maynard Woodworth was appointed as the first incumbent in 1871. He moved quickly to reform the system and adopted a military model for his medical staff; putting his physicians in uniforms, and instituting examinations for applicants. Woodworth created a cadre of mobile, career service physicians, who could be assigned as needed to the various Marine Hospitals. The commissioned officer corps was formally established by legislation after the fact in 1889, and signed by President Grover Cleveland.

The scope of activities of the Marine Hospital Service began to expand well beyond the care of merchant seamen in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, into control of infectious disease, collection of health statistics, and basic science research. Following cholera epidemics in the US in 1873, the National Quarantine Act of 1878 vested quarantine authority to the Marine Hospital Service. Under the Public Health Act of 1879, this authority was temporarily shared with the U.S. Army and Navy through the National Board of Health, until 1883. 

Given the prevalence of infectious disease among immigrants arriving from famine and war areas of Europe, the Marine Hospital Service was assigned to medically inspect immigrants at such sites as Ellis Island in New York Harbor. In 1878, an act of Congress enabled the Marine Hospital Service to collect data on communicable diseases and perform surveillance of the incidence and distribution of diseases; these programs would eventually become the National Center for Health Statistics. In 1887, the Hygienic Laboratory, the predecessor of the National Institutes of Health, began as a single-room laboratory for bacteriological investigation at the Staten Island Marine Hospital, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1891.

In 1899, internal divisions were formed for the first time, specifically the Divisions of Marine Hospitals, Domestic Quarantine, Foreign Quarantine, Sanitary Reports and Statistics, Scientific Research, and Personnel and Accounts. These original divisions would remain through 1943, although there were minor name changes throughout this time, and a few new divisions would be created.

=== Development as the Public Health Service ===
Because the Service took on broader responsibilities, in 1902 it was renamed as the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service. In 1912, under new authorizing legislation, it was established as the Public Health Service (PHS) to express the enlarged scope of its work.

The 1912 PHS law () expanded the agency&#x27;s mission from communicable to include non-communicable diseases. In 1913, the former Cincinnati Marine Hospital building was reopened as a Field Investigation Station for water pollution research. This was the beginning of the PHS Environmental Health Divisions, a precursor to the Environmental Protection Agency. 

In 1914, the Office of Industrial Hygiene and Sanitation, the direct predecessor of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, was founded at the Pittsburgh Marine Hospital. Both of these offices were within the Division of Scientific Research.

The Division of Venereal Diseases was established in 1918, and the Narcotics Division in 1929 (it eventually became the National Institute of Mental Health). In 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory was redesignated as the (singular) National Institute of Health (NIH) by the Ransdell Act; in 1937, it absorbed the rest of the Division of Scientific Research, of which it was formerly part, and in 1938 it moved to its current campus in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1939, PHS as a whole was transferred from the Department of the Treasury into the new Federal Security Agency. In 1942, the Office of Malaria Control in War Areas was created, which in 1946 became the Communicable Disease Center, which would eventually become the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Beginning in the late 1920s and continuing through the New Deal era, a significant building campaign upgraded several marine hospitals into large, monumental buildings, in contrast with the smaller buildings common for the 19th-century buildings. PHS&#x27;s headquarters were in the Butler Building, a converted mansion across the street from the United States Capitol, from 1891 until April 1929. It expanded into office space in Temporary Building C on the National Mall in July 1920, which became its temporary headquarters after the Butler Building was closed for demolition. In May 1933, the new Public Health Service Building opened on the National Mall.

=== Mid-20th century ===

By 1943, PHS contained eight administrative divisions, plus the National Cancer Institute, St. Elizabeths Hospital, and Freedmen&#x27;s Hospital under the direct supervision of the Surgeon General. These divisions often had overlapping scopes, which was seen as administratively unwieldy. Additionally, some of these had been created and specified through several pieces of legislation that were inconsistent in their scope, while some had been created internally by PHS or delegated from the parent Federal Security Agency.

In 1943, PHS&#x27;s divisions were collected into three operating agencies by law (). The Bureau of State Services administered cooperative services to U.S. states through technical and financial assistance, the Bureau of Medical Services provided direct patient care through hospitals and clinics as well as foreign quarantine facilities, and the National Institute of Health remained independent to perform laboratory research activities. Additionally, all of the laws affecting the functions of the public health agencies were consolidated for the first time in the Public Health Service Act of 1944.

The mid-20th century was a time of expansion for both NIH and the PHS environmental health programs. In 1948, NIH&#x27;s name was changed to the plural National Institutes of Health, and by the end of 1950 six new institutes had been created within it. The environmental health programs expanded from water pollution into air, industrial, and chemical pollution and radiological health research during and after World War II, and in 1954 they moved across town from the former Cincinnati Marine Hospital to the newly constructed Robert A. Taft Sanitary Engineering Center.

However, the period was one of decline for the marine hospital system. In 1943, the hospital system had reached its peak of 30 hospitals. During 1944–1953, a wave of closings eliminated nine of the ten Marine Hospitals that had not been upgraded since the 1920s, as well as three newer general hospitals and the tuberculosis sanatorium at Fort Stanton. However, PHS funded construction of hospitals by the states through the 1946 Hill–Burton Act.

In 1953 the Federal Security Agency was abolished and most of its functions, including the PHS, were transferred to the newly formed Department of Health, Education and Welfare. In 1955 the Division of Indian Health was established upon transfer of these functions from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior.

=== Reorganization era ===

Between 1966 and 1973, a series of reorganizations and realignments led to the end of the bureau structure. The reorganization by 1968 replaced PHS&#x27;s old bureau structure with two new operating agencies: the Health Services and Mental Health Administration (HSMHA) and the Consumer Protection and Environmental Health Service (CPEHS), with NIH remaining independent and less affected by the organization. In 1968, the position of Assistant Secretary for Health was created, supplanting the Surgeon General as the top leader of the Public Health Service, although the Surgeon General was retained in a subordinate role. Also in 1968, the Food and Drug Administration, which traced its origins to 1862, became part of the PHS. The goal of the reorganizations was to coordinate the previously fragmented divisions to provide a holistic approach to large, overarching problems.

Additionally, a second wave of hospital closings during 1965–1970 closed the three remaining general hospitals at inland locations along the Mississippi River and Great Lakes, as well as the 19th-century Savannah hospital. In addition, St. Elizabeths Hospital and the psychiatric hospitals at Lexington and Fort Worth were transferred to other agencies, and the Galveston hospital was replaced with one acquired by PHS in nearby Nassau Bay. This left eight general hospitals plus the National Leprosarium in the system.

The new agencies came to be seen as unwieldy and bureaucratic, and they would turn out to be short-lived. CPEHS was broken up in 1970, as much of it was transferred out of PHS to form the core of the new Environmental Protection Agency. Around the same time, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health was created out of the former Division of Industrial Hygiene by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. HSMHA was broken up into four successor agencies in 1973.

=== Modern period ===

====Late 20th century====
Since 1973, PHS has encompassed between six and ten operating agencies anchored by NIH, FDA, and CDC. The organizational changes in the 20th century after 1973 have been:
* Creation of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in 1980
* Merging of the Health Resources Administration and Health Services Administration into the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in 1982
* The Indian Health Service being split from HRSA in 1988
* The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research being split from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health in 1989
* Breakup of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration in 1992, with its research functions returning to the National Institutes of Health, and its services components becoming the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

The PHS hospital system had been the target of efforts to close the entire system since the mid-1970s. As the result of pressure from the Reagan administration, the PHS hospital system was abolished in 1981, with the last eight hospitals transferred to other organizations: five to non-governmental entities, two to the Department of Defense, and one to the State of Louisiana. PHS would however continue to operate the National Leprosarium until 1999.

In 1995, supervision of the agencies within PHS was shifted from the Assistant Secretary for Health to report directly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, eliminating PHS as an administrative level in the organizational hierarchy, although the agencies and offices are still legally designated as part of PHS.

==== 21st century ====
The Office of Global Affairs was formed from two components within the Office of the Secretary and Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health in 2002.

The Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness was created in 2002, which in 2022 became the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health was created by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022.

==Activities==
Public health worker Sara Josephine Baker, M.D. established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy, leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and teaching mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies. Another key pioneer of public health in the U.S. was Lillian Wald, who founded the Henry Street Settlement house in New York. The Visiting Nurse Service of New York was a significant organization for bringing health care to the urban poor.

In the area of environmental protection and public health, a Public Health Service 1969 community water survey that looked at more than a thousand drinking water systems across the United States drew two important conclusions that supported a growing demand for stronger protections that were adopted in the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act. The survey concluded, first, that the state supervision programs were very uneven and often lax, and, second, that the bacteriological quality of the water, particularly among small systems, was of concern.

The 1963 Clean Air Act gave the Public Health Service in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare the authority to take abatement action against industries if it could be demonstrated that they were polluting across state lines, or if a governor requested. Some of these actions involved the Ohio River Valley, New York, and New Jersey. The service also began monitoring air pollution. the 1967 Clean Air Act redirected attention to larger air quality control regions.

== Controversies ==
===&quot;Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male&quot;===

In 1932, the Public Health Service, working with the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama, began a study to record the natural history of syphilis in hopes of justifying treatment programs for blacks. It was titled the &quot;Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male&quot;.

The study initially involved 600 black men—399 with syphilis, 201 who did not have the disease. The study was conducted without the benefit of patients&#x27; informed consent. Researchers told the men they were being treated for &quot;bad blood&quot;, a local term referring to several ailments, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. In truth, they did not receive the proper treatment needed to cure their illness. In exchange for taking part in the study, the men received free medical exams, free meals, and burial insurance. Although originally projected to last six months, the study actually went on for 40 years. Penicillin—which can be used to treat syphilis—was discovered in the 1940s. However, the study continued and treatment was never given to the subjects. Because of this, it has been called &quot;arguably the most &#x27;infamous&#x27; biomedical research study in U.S. history&quot;.

===Syphilis studies in Guatemala===
A USPHS physician who took part in the 1932–1972 Tuskegee program, John Charles Cutler, was in charge of the U.S. government&#x27;s syphilis experiments in Guatemala, in which in the Central American Republic of Guatemala, Guatemalan prisoners, soldiers, orphaned children, and others were deliberately infected with syphilis and other sexually-transmitted diseases from 1946 to 1948, in order to scientifically study the disease, in a project funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized to the Republic of Guatemala for this program in 2010, in light of the serious ethical lapses in moral judgement which occurred.

<doc id="224133" wikidata="Q2086752" url="?curid=224133" title="Philip Gilbert Hamerton">
<text>Philip Gilbert Hamerton (10 September 1834 – 4 November 1894) was an English artist, art critic and author. He was a keen advocate of contemporary printmaking and most of his writings concern the graphic arts. He was an important theorist of the English Etching Revival.

==Early life==
Hamerton was born at Laneside, a hamlet near Shaw and Crompton, Lancashire, England. His mother died giving birth to him, and his father died ten years later. When he was about five, he was sent to live with his two aunts at an estate called the Hollins on the edge of Burnley, where he attended Burnley Grammar School.

==Career==

Hamerton&#x27;s first literary attempt, a volume of poems, was unsuccessful, leading him to devote himself for a time entirely to landscape painting; he camped out in the Scottish Highlands, where he eventually rented the former island of Inistrynich in Loch Awe, upon which he settled with his wife Eugénie Gindriez, the daughter of a French republican magistrate, in 1858.

Discovering after a time that he was more suited to art criticism than painting, he moved to Sens and later to Autun, where he produced his &quot;Painter&#x27;s Camp in the Highlands&quot; (1863), which was very successful and prepared the way for his standard work on &quot;Etching and Etchers&quot; (1866). In the following year he published &quot;Contemporary French Painters&quot;, and in 1868 a continuation, &quot;Painting in France after the Decline of Classicism&quot;.

He had by now become art critic to the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, which necessitated frequent visits to England, forcing him to give it up. He proceeded in 1870 to establish and edit an art journal of his own, &quot;The Portfolio&quot;, a monthly periodical, each number of which included of a monograph upon some artist or group of artists, often written by him. The journal championed printmaking, especially etching. He selected and wrote the accompanying text for &quot;Etchings by French and English Artists&quot; (London: Seeley, 1874) which included work by Alphonse Legros and Léon Gaucherel. The discontinuation of his painting gave him time for writing, and he successively produced &quot;The Intellectual Life&quot; (1873), perhaps the best known and most valuable of his writings; &quot;Round my House&quot; (1876), notes on French society by a resident; and &quot;Modern Frenchmen&quot; (1879), admirable short biographies. He also wrote two novels, &quot;Wenderholme&quot; (1870) and &quot;Marmorne&quot; (1878).

In 1884 &quot;Human Intercourse&quot;, another volume of essays, was published, and shortly afterwards Hamerton began his autobiography, which he brought down to 1858. In 1882 he issued a finely illustrated work on the technique of the great masters of various arts, under the title of &quot;The Graphic Arts&quot;, and three years later another splendidly illustrated volume, &quot;Landscape&quot;, which traces the influence of landscape upon the mind of man. His last books were: &quot;Portfolio Papers&quot; (1889) and &quot;French and English&quot; (1889). 

In 1891 he removed to Villa Clématis in the Parc des Princes, district of Boulogne-Billancourt in the southwest suburbs of Paris. He died there suddenly on 4 November 1896, aged sixty, occupied to the last with his labours on &quot;The Portfolio&quot; and other writings on art. In 1897 &#x27;Philip Gilbert Hamerton: an &quot;Autobiography&quot;, 1834–1858; and a &quot;Memoir&quot; by his wife, 1858–1894&#x27; was published.

<text>Tetzcoco (Classical Nahuatl: &quot;Tetzco(h)co&quot; , Otomi: ) was a major Acolhua altepetl (city-state) in the central Mexican plateau region of Mesoamerica during the Late Postclassic period of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican chronology. It was situated on the eastern bank of Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico, to the northeast of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. The site of pre-Columbian Tetzcoco is now subsumed by the modern Mexican &quot;municipio&quot; of Texcoco and its major settlement, the city formally known as Texcoco de Mora. It also lies within the greater metropolitan area of Mexico City.

Pre-Columbian Tetzcoco is most noted for its membership in the Aztec Triple Alliance. At the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, it was one of the largest and most prestigious cities in central Mexico, second only to the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. A survey of Mesoamerican cities estimated that pre-conquest Tetzcoco had a population of 24,000+ and occupied an area of 450 hectares.

The people of &quot;Tetzcoco&quot; were called &quot;Tetzcocatl&quot; (singular) or &quot;Tetzcocah&quot; (plural).

== History ==
Tetzcoco was founded in the 12th century, on the eastern shore of Lake Texcoco, probably by the Chichimecs. In or about 1337, the Acolhua, with Tepanec help, expelled Chichimecs from Tetzcoco and Tetzcoco became the Acolhua capital city, taking over that role from Coatlinchan.

In 1418, Ixtlilxochitl I, the &quot;tlatoani&quot; (ruler) of Tetzcoco, was dethroned by Tezozomoc of Azcapotzalco. Ten years later, in 1428, Ixtlilxochitl&#x27;s son, Nezahualcoyotl allied with the Mexica to defeat Tezozomoc&#x27;s son and successor, Maxtla. Tetzcoco and the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan, with the Tepanecs of Tlacopan, subsequently formalized their association as the Triple Alliance. However this was an uneven alliance as Tlacopan entered the battle against Azcapotzalco late. Tetzcoco thereby became the second-most important city in the eventual Aztec empire, by agreement receiving two-fifths of the tribute collected while Tlacopan received one-fifth.

Tetzcoco was known as a center of learning within the empire, and had a famed library including books from older Mesoamerican civilizations.

===Palace, gardens and canal system===
Erected by the hill of Tetzcotzingo, the royal residence had aqueducts, baths, gardens, stairways and over 300 separate chambers.

The palace gardens were a vast botanical collection that included plants from not only the growing Aztec Empire but also the most remote corners of Mesoamerica. Remnants of the gardens still exist to this day and have recently been studied by a team of Discovery Channel scientists, who were able to demonstrate by means of modeling and computer simulation that the layout of the site had been carefully planned to be in alignment with astronomical events, with an emphasis on Venus, and not simply aligned with the cardinal directions as previously assumed.

The water used to irrigate the gardens was obtained from the springs beyond the mountains to the east of Tetzcoco. The water was channeled through canals carved into the rock. In certain areas, rock staircases were used as waterfalls. After clearing the mountains, the canals continued downhill to a point a short distance from Tetzcotzingo. There the path to the city was blocked by a deep canyon that ran from north to south. Nezahualcoyotl ordered that the gap be filled with tons of rocks and stones, thus creating one of the major aqueducts in the New World.
===Sacred hill===
The whole hill of Tetzcotzingo was also served by this canal system and converted by his designers into a sacred place for the rain god Tláloc, complete with waterfalls, exotic animals and birds.

On the summit of the mountain he constructed a shrine to the god, laid out in hanging gardens reached by an airy flight of five hundred and twenty marble steps, a significant number, since according to Aztec mythology the gods have the opportunity to destroy humanity once every 52 years.

==Rulers of Tetzcoco==

Xolotl was said to be the founder of Tetzcoco in 1115 AD and reigned until 1232. He was followed by Nopaltzin (1232–1263), Tlotzin (1263–1298), Quinatzin (1298–1357), Techotlalazin (1357–1409), Ixlilxochitl (1409–1418), Nezahualcoyotl (1420–1472), Nezahualpilli (1472–1516), Cacama (1517–1519), Coanchochtzin (1520–1521), and Don Fernando Ixtlilxochitl (1521–1531).

Nezahualcoyotl (1403–1473) was a noted poet, philosopher, and patron of the arts. He also had a large botanical and zoological garden, with specimens of plants and animals from throughout the empire and from the more distant lands with which the Empire traded.

Nezahualcoyotl&#x27;s son Nezahualpilli (1464–1515) continued the tradition of patronizing the arts.

In 1520 the troops of Hernán Cortés occupied the city and killed Cacamatzin, Nezahualpilli&#x27;s son and the last independent &quot;tlatoani&quot;, installing Ixtlilxochitl II as a puppet ruler. Cortés made Tetzcoco his base and employed Tetzcocan warriors in the Siege of Tenochtitlan.

After the fall of Tenochtitlan, Spanish authorities continued to recognize the importance of Tetzcoco as a Spanish &quot;altepetl&quot;, designating it as one of four urban centers in the Valley of Mexico as a &quot;ciudad,&quot; &quot;city,&quot; rebranding it &quot;Texcoco.&quot; The Tetzcoca royal family continued to rule, handling succession to the throne in accordance with the traditional Aztec patterns of legitimacy. In this unique passage of kingship, cohorts of brothers inherited the right to rule, then sons of the next cohort, with claims to inheritance revolving around consanguinean ties to Mexica royalty from Tenochtitlan. 

Alva Ixtlilxochitl, the immediate Tetzcoca heir after the Spanish-Aztec War, presided over colonial Texcoco as governor until his death in approximately 1550. Restall describes the political situation of Texcoco in the coming decades as follows:&quot;when Ixtlilxochitl died, he was succeeded by three of his brothers, don Jorge Yoyontzin (to 1533), don Pedro Tetlahuehuetzquititzin (to 1539), and don Antonio Pimentel Tlahuitolzin (to 1545); the latter&#x27;s nephew (and a son of Coanacoch), don Hernando Pimentel Nezahualcoyotzin, would then rule as &quot;tlahtoani&quot; [king] &quot;and gobernador&quot; [governor] for two decades. Ixtlilxochitl&#x27;s postwar rule thus ushered in a return of governmental stability, with the succession dispute and lethal warfare and lethal warfare of 1515-1521 a relatively short disruption to the otherwise calm dynastic century and a half from Nezahualcoyot through his great-grandson Pimentel. The dynasty would lose control of the city&#x27;s top political office after that, but would persist as a landed aristocracy for centuries. Tetzcoco&#x27;s decline as a regional power would likewise be very gradual, beginning at the end of the sixteenth century.&quot;Concurrent with these politics was a mass outbreak of smallpox which ravaged Texcoco in the few months after the Spanish-Aztec War. This outbreak both shortened the tenures of Texcoco&#x27;s last &quot;tlahtoanis&quot; and sent the city&#x27;s population into freefall.

==Subsequent history==
From 1827 to 1830, Texcoco served as the capital of the State of Mexico.

<doc id="224136" wikidata="Q321283" url="?curid=224136" title="Abilene paradox">
<text>The Abilene paradox is a collective fallacy, in which a group of people collectively decide on a course of action that is counter to the preferences of most or all individuals in the group, while each individual believes it to be aligned with the preferences of most of the others. It involves a breakdown of group communication in which each member mistakenly believes that their own preferences are counter to the group&#x27;s, and therefore does not raise objections. They even go so far as to state support for an outcome they do not want. 

A common phrase related to the Abilene paradox is a desire to not &quot;rock the boat&quot;. Like in groupthink, group members jointly decide on a course of action that they would not choose as individuals. However, while in groupthink, individuals undergo self-deception and distortion of their own views (driven by, for example, not wanting to suffer in anticipation of a future they sense they cannot avoid by speaking out), whereas in the Abilene Paradox, individuals are unable to perceive the views or preferences of others, or to manage an agreement.

==Overview==
The term was introduced by management expert Jerry B. Harvey in his 1974 article &quot;The Abilene Paradox: The Management of Agreement&quot;. The name of the phenomenon comes from an anecdote that Harvey uses in the article to elucidate the paradox:

The Abilene Paradox consists of five components:

# The first component refers to mutual agreement of a group that the current situation is not acceptable. However, on the individual level, the members may be satisfied with the existing setting after they have compared it with proposed alternatives.
# The second component stands for ineffective communication within the group when several members express considerable support for a decision because they assume that is the desire of others. This process of communication reinforces assumptions that individual thoughts are a minority in the group.
# The third component of the Abilene Paradox is the vocalisation of group sentiment which arose from inaccurate assumptions or incorrect interpretation of the &quot;signals&quot; given by other members.
# The fourth component refers to the decision-maker&#x27;s reflections on the actions taken, usually in the form of questions as follows: &quot;Why did we do this?&quot;, &quot;How can we justify our decision to others?&quot;.
# The fifth component refers to the defeat of the group leader to poor decision making in order to avoid making similar decisions in the future. 

There are several factors that may indicate the presence of the Abilene Paradox in the decision-making process:

* Leaders who publicly do not fear the unknown. Such arrogance leads them to go along as they do not possess sufficient understanding of complex problems. Rather, they stick to the &quot;that sounds good to me&quot; attitude.
* A group with no-conflict or no-debate type of decision-making. When such views are supported in the cohort, the lack of diverse opinions becomes the foundation for mismanagement of agreement. This can be visible by the emergence of the &quot;I will go along with that&quot; attitude.
* Overriding leaders and a strong organisation culture. A strong leader and solid organisation may become a powerful asset, and it may also intimidate other members of subordinates to the point of submission. This results in the inclination of supporting more dominant ideas.
* Lack of diversity and pluralistic perspective in a group. Homogeneous groups tend to be conformal. Such groups tend to achieve consensus rather than searching for the &quot;right&quot; decision. 
* Recognition of a dysfunctional decision-making environment. Management in this environment has lost control, as the directional prerogative of management has succumbed to wanting to be liked by avoiding conflict.
* The feeling of a &quot;messiah&quot; in the organisation and action anxiety on the part of management. When the group handles complex tasks, there is usually one person or a small cohort within the group who has required expertise to manage in this situation. As a result, there is a tendency to acquiesce to them.
* The development of a &quot;spiral of silence&quot; in the organisation. The spiral of silence occurs when one&#x27;s perception of the majority opinion in the organisation suppresses one&#x27;s willingness to express any challenging opinion against the most visible point of view.

==Research==
Based on an online experiment with more than 600 participants, being prosocial and generally caring about the implications of one&#x27;s actions on others (measured by the social value orientation measure) has been shown to increase the likelihood that an individual finds themselves in an Abilene Paradox with others, especially if they are not the first to have a say.

The study at Makerere University Business School described the case of the Abilene Paradox in the process of decision-making in 2006: The institution was in a dispute with its parent institution, Makerere University, over its status as an independent university. A meeting of the MUBS Academic Staff Association (MUBASA) was called to discuss the issue, and the attendees voted to support MUBS council&#x27;s decision to sue the Ministry of Education for interfering in a high court pronouncement. Each member of the association was to contribute towards the legal costs. By interviewing 68 employees, the researcher found that the majority of them never considered it a solution but thought that others strongly support the idea of starting the trial.

Chen and Chang conducted a study about the effects, causes, and influences of the Abilene paradox, if any, on their elementary school; this study involved twelve faculty members. Results of this Abilene paradox study showed a negative effect on the school’s operation, through poor communication, inadequate interaction, isolation, exclusion, and rising gossip.

==Applications of the concept==
The theory is often used to help explain poor group decisions, especially notions of the superiority of &quot;rule by committee&quot;. For example, Harvey cited the Watergate scandal as a potential instance of the Abilene paradox in action. The Watergate scandal occurred in the United States in the 1970s when many high officials of the Nixon administration colluded in the cover-up and perhaps the execution of a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C. Harvey quotes several people indicted for the coverup as indicating that they had personal qualms about the decision but feared to voice them. In one instance, campaign aide Herbert Porter said that he &quot;was not one to stand up in a meeting and say that this should be stopped&quot;, a decision that he attributed to &quot;the fear of the group pressure that would ensue, of not being a team player&quot;.

Another notable example of applying the Abilene paradox to the notorious real-world event can be seen during and in the aftermath of the 1989 United Kingdom Hillsborough tragedy and its cover-up by the authorities, which was characterised by individually hesitant, but otherwise compliant, government agents and the narrative and available information moulded and manipulated by the state. The other frequently cited example is the case of Challenger disaster, though in that case researchers use both the concepts of groupthink and the Abilene paradox as possible explanation of the events.

The phenomenon of the Abilene paradox can also be used in information systems development, to conceptualise and operationalise the relationship between systems analysts, users, and other organisational stakeholders in situations of illusory agreement.

== Related concepts and explanations ==
Other theories add to the Abilene paradox’s explanation of poor decision-making in groups, notably, such phenomena as groupthink and pluralistic ignorance.

The concept of groupthink posits that individuals correctly perceive the preferences of others, undergo some form of motivated reasoning, which distorts their true preferences, and then willingly choose to conform; hence, they generally feel positively about the resulting group decisions. The success of groupthink also hinges on the long-term homogeneity of the group, which seeks to keep that same cohesiveness and therefore to avoid all potential conflict. However, while groupthink, to some extent, depends on the ability of individuals to perceive attitudes and desires of others, the Abilene paradox hinges on the &quot;in&quot;ability to gage true wants and intentions of group members.

The concept of pluralistic ignorance, on the other hand, is also defined as the situation where an individual underestimates the extent to which their views are shared by the other members of the group or organisation. In some ways, pluralistic ignorance can be considered as a factor inciting situations where the Abilene paradox occurs — individuals’ inability to correctly estimate the share of potential supporters lead to the assumption of ‘the worst case scenario’ and in-advance mitigation of potential risks of dealing with the opponents. Some researchers consider pluralistic ignorance to be a wider-ranging concept: while both groupthink and the Abilene paradox are usually discussed as the detriments to successful group decision-making, pluralistic ignorance is sometimes evaluated neutrally.

<text>Rail transport in France dates from the first French railway in 1823 to present-day enterprises such as the AGV.

==Beginnings==
France was a sluggard in building railways, compared to Britain and Belgium, which had already demonstrated their worthiness by 1830. Urban land was expensive, as were iron and coal. A more serious obstacle was powerful political opposition, especially as mobilized by the transport companies that used canals, roads, and rivers. They blocked the necessary railway charters in Parliament. Already in 1810, the French engineer Pierre Michel Moisson-Desroches had proposed to build seven national railway lines from Paris, in order to travel &quot;short distances within the Empire&quot;. However, nothing happened. Mining companies in 1828 opened the first railway to move coal from the fields around St. Etienne 11 miles to the Loire River. Most of the work was done by horses, although steam locomotives were used for the last segment. Passenger service opened in 1835. 

Between 1828 and 1833, the 57 km Saint-Étienne–Lyon railway was constructed. During the first few months of operation, horses were used to provide the tractive power on this line, then locomotives were used.

The small French banking system was stretched to the limit in funding the early operations. The Péreire brothers were pioneers, but they discovered expenses were much higher than expected, especially maintenance costs. The government rejected all major rail projects before 1842, and France steadily fell behind the nations that had reached a quick consensus on railway policy. In 1842 Britain had 1,900 miles of railways in operation; France only 300.

The eventual relationship created between the French rail system and the government formed a compromise between two competing options:
# the completely &quot;laissez-faire&quot; free-market system that had created Britain&#x27;s elaborate rail network
# a government-built and government-controlled railway, such as had grown up in Belgium.

France employed a mixture of these two models to construct its railways, but eventually turned definitively to the side of government control. The relationships between the government and private rail companies became complicated, with many conflicts and disagreements between the two groups.

==Government intervention==

The 1842 agreement, designed by Adolphe Thiers, The Thiers Plan adopted in 1842 called for the state to contribute about $50,000 per mile and own the system. Private companies spend about $40,000 per mile for track, equipment, buildings, locomotives, and cars. The government further subsidized the companies by having the department of the Ponts et Chaussées do most of the planning and engineering work for new lines. The government would assist in securing the land, often by expropriation. The government also agreed to pay infrastructure costs, building bridges, tunnels, and track bed. The private companies would then furnish the tracks, stations and rolling stock, as well as pay the operating costs. The policy was confusing and contradictory, and blocked monopolies, which meant no regional networks could form.

This general policy masked many exceptions and additions. The most successful companies, especially the Chemins de fer du Nord, would often build their own lines themselves in order to avoid the complications of going through the government. For instance, during the economic boom period of the 1850s, the national government had to pay only 19 percent of the costs of railway construction. Other less successful lines, such as the Midi, would often need more assistance from the government to remain in operation. The same proved true during recessions, such as in 1859, when the railway lines gained a new agreement to save them from bankruptcy. In exchange for funding part of the construction of rail lines, the French government set maximum rates that the companies could charge. It also insisted that all government traffic must travel at a third of standard costs.

The expectation that the government would eventually nationalize the rail system formed another important element in French railway legislation. The original agreement of 1842 leased the railway lines to the companies for only 36 years. Napoleon III extended these leases to 99 years soon after he came to power. That the rail companies only operated on leases paved the way for the nationalization of the French rail lines under the socialist government of the 1930s.

When the Republic replaced the monarchy in 1848, 2000 miles of track were in operation but the situation was highly unsatisfactory. Three dozen companies were in operation, most of them with incomplete lines that sharply limited traffic. Financially, most were in great distress. Moving passengers and freight from one plane to another was quite difficult, and many called for radical reforms but no legislation was passed.

The concession for the Strasbourg–Basel railway was granted to the &quot;Compagnie du chemin de fer de Strasbourg à Bâle&quot;, founded by the Koechlin brothers, in 1838. The railway was opened in 1840–1844.

==Success under the Second Empire==
When Napoleon III turned his presidency into an imperial role, he gained almost dictatorial powers and made completion of a good working system a high priority. The first step was to amalgamate all the companies along specific routes. The consolidation into six major companies proved successful. By 1857 the consolidation was complete, and the government was no longer operating any lines. All the trunk lines were interconnected. The original plan of using Paris as a hub was continued, so that long-distance travel from one place to another necessitated connecting to another line in Paris. Paris grew dramatically in terms of population, industry, finance, commercial activity, and tourism. The worldwide commercial crisis of 1857–58 delayed financing and construction for a brief while, but the financing for all six companies was solidified by government guarantees. The original vision from 1842 of a grant national network was largely realized. The system was virtually complete by 1870, although constant construction was done to upgrade the quality of lines, set up double trackage, rebuild bridges, Improve signaling, and large freight yards and passenger stations, reduce slopes and drill long tunnels.

===National policy===
The Second Empire under Napoleon III, 1852–1871, emphasized building infrastructure. Napoleon III placed great emphasis on economic growth and modernization, with special attention to infrastructure and construction of railways, as well as coal and iron establishments He also stimulated French banking, completion of the telegraph system and subsidization of steamship lines Railways were given priority over canals and local roads. The state built most of the railway system and invited private companies to operate the lines under leases of up to 99 years. They were publicly owned but privately operated. The state guaranteed the dividends of the railway operating companies, and in exchange took two-thirds of any greater profits. The financing involved stretched the private banking sector to its limit, and was greatly augmented by the introduction of the 300 franc bond, which enabled large numbers of middle-class Frenchmen to invest easily in the economic expansion.

When railways were begun France already operated well-established governmental structures and procedures that could easily expand to encompass railway regulations as well. The engineering bureaucracy was world-class. The agency that handled canals expanded to include railways. The Ponts et Chaussées, had very close control over the construction of roads, bridges, and canals in France; therefore, it was inevitable that the new railways would also fall under the government&#x27;s close scrutiny.
Other reasons also led the French government to control its railways closely. Unlike Britain or the United States, France as a European continental power had pressing military needs from its railways, needs which a private sector might not provide. The French government constructed long stretches of strategic railways in eastern France along the German border that served strategically crucial ends but lacked economic viability. &quot;Pure&quot; private economic interests would not have constructed these routes on their own, so France used government rewards and pressure to encourage the rail companies to build the needed lines. (The German and Russian Empires also had widespread strategic railway systems that purely commercial interests would not have built.

By 1867 six large companies controlled networks comprising a total of 16,000 kilometers, and by 1871 the systems embraced over 23,000 kilometers. They were:
*Chemin de Fer de l&#x27;Est
*Chemin de Fer du Nord
*Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée
*Chemin de Fer Paris-Orléans
*Chemin de Fer du Midi

===Leadership===
The railway construction was such a grand project, and it showed in such dramatic effects in Great Britain, the leading financiers, industrialists, and technicians competed vigorously for the place, all under the Emperor&#x27;s watchful eye. Key players included the brothers Isaac Pereire and Emile Pereire, Auguste de Morny, Paulin Talabot, and—richest of them all—James de Rothschild. In the battle for control of a line from Paris to the Mediterranean, Talabot, with Rothschild support, won, besting the Pereire brothers. In 1853, Morny floated the idea of a Grand Central Railroad. By 1857 it became the scheme for six major monopolistic networks in six regions: North (Nord), East (Est), West (Ouest), PLM, Orleans, and Southern (Midi). The Government gave 99-year leases, and gave continuing subsidies, and return for heavily subsidized or free government movements. The six were required to build feeder networks locally.

===Railways in operation===
The first completed lines radiated out of Paris, connecting France&#x27;s major cities to the capital. These lines still form the backbone of the French railway system. By the 1860s, workers had completed the basic structure of the network, but they continued to build many minor lines during the late 19th century to fill in the gaps.

By 1855, the many original small firms had coalesced into six large companies, each having a regional monopoly in one area of France. The Nord, Est, Ouest, Paris-Orléans, Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée (PLM), and the Midi lines divided the nation into strict corridors of control. Difficulties arose in that the six large monopolies, with the exception of the Midi Company, all connected to Paris, but did not link together anywhere else in the country. The French railway map comprised a series of unconnected branches running out of Paris. While this meant that trains served Paris well, other parts of the country were not served as well. For instance, one branch of the Paris-Orléans Line ended in Clermont-Ferrand, while Lyon stood on the PLM Line. Thus any goods or passengers requiring transportation from Lyon to Clermont-Ferrand in 1860 needed to take a circuitous route via Paris of over seven hundred kilometers, even though a mere hundred and twenty kilometers separated the two cities.

This centering on Paris led to inefficiency in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871). The Prusso-German railway lines, inter-connected in a grid-like fashion, proved far more efficient at advancing troops and supplies to the front than the French one. The arrangement of the lines also hurt France&#x27;s economy. Shipping costs between regional centers became greatly inflated. Thus many cities specialized in exporting their goods to Paris, as trans-shipment to a second city would double the price. France lagged behind German building following the unification of Germany in 1871. France ended up with this arrangement for a number of reasons. Paris formed the undisputed capital of France, and many viewed it as the capital of Europe. To French railway planners, it seemed only natural that all the lines should involve the metropolis. By contrast, Germany ended up with a far superior system because it had little unity and many centers vying for preeminence. Thus a variety of rail centers arose. Berlin, Munich, Dresden, Hamburg, and the Rhine areas all had links to each other. By 1900, German preeminence was obvious and factored into the growing hostility toward Germany in France.

By 1914 the French railway system had become one of the densest and most highly developed in the world, and had reached its maximum extent of around . About one-third of this mileage comprised narrow-gauge lines.

Following 1918, France received significant additions to its locomotive and wagon fleet as part of the reparations from Germany required by the Versailles Treaty. In addition, the network of the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine was taken over by France when the Alsace-Lorraine region, which had been under German control since the Franco-Prussian War, was returned to France.

===Rates decline and tonnage increases===
Railway freight rates fell steadily from 14.5 (centimes per ton-kilometer 0 and 1841–1844, 28.7 and 1855–1864, then slowly 25.4 in 1905–1913. Meanwhile, freight rates on the roads held steady at about 25. The rapid pace of industrialization in the growth of national markets dramatically increased the tonnage carried. In 1845, the railways carried 102 million ton-kilometers; by 1850, the total had quadrupled to 423 million. By 1855 it reached 1,530 million, in 1860, 3,140 million.

==Nationalisation==
By the 1930s, competition from motor vehicles took its toll on the railways, and the rail network needed pruning. The narrow-gauge lines suffered most severely from road competition; many thousands of miles of narrow-gauge lines closed during the 1930s. By the 1950s the once extensive narrow-gauge system had practically become extinct. Many minor standard gauge lines also closed. The French railway system today has around of track.

Many of the private railway operating companies began to face financial difficulties. In 1938 the socialist government fully nationalised the railway system and formed the &quot;Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Francais&quot; (SNCF). Regional authorities have begun to specify schedules since the mid of the 1970s with general conventions between the regions and the SNCF since the mid-1980s.

From 1981 onwards, a newly constructed set of high-speed TGV (&quot;Train à Grande Vitesse&quot;) lines linked France&#x27;s most populated areas with the capital, starting with Paris-Lyon. In 1994, the Channel Tunnel opened, connecting France and Great Britain by rail under the English Channel.

<text>Sesame Street Live is a live touring show based on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot; produced by Roundroom Live under license of Sesame Workshop.

==History==
The VEE Corporation was started in March 1980 by founder Vincent Egan, who had an idea to produce a live-character show based on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. He had worked for the Ice Follies tour, which had a segment featuring Muppets. Egan approached Jim Henson&#x27;s company and Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, who were interested. With outside funding, Vee was able to sign a licensing agreement with the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop for the characters.

The first &quot;Sesame Street Live&quot; show opened in September 1980 at the Metropolitan Sports Center in Bloomington, Minnesota for a successful five-day run. The following shows in five locations had lackluster attendance costing VEE the profits made in Bloomington. Egan figured that the marketing material was confusing people in those markets as what type of show was not specified. He overhauled the script and marketing while getting his creditors to wait for payments. That Christmas, the show went on to play for four weeks at Madison Square Garden&#x27;s 4,000-seat Felt Forum in New York City before an audience of 100,000 people.

VEE quickly ramped up to two different shows for the 1981–1982 season, then added a third Australia show in 1982–1983. From the 1983–1984 season until the 1988–1989 season there were only two &quot;Sesame Street Live&quot; shows on tour.

On April 1, 2015, Blue Star Media, LLC purchased VEE Corporation with Egan continuing on as a consultant; later that year the combined company was renamed VStar Entertainment Group.

In November 2016, Sesame Workshop announced an agreement with Feld Entertainment to take over producing &quot;Sesame Street Live&quot;. VStar continues to produce other Sesame Street shows at various locations, and provides costumes.

==Productions==

In order to keep the show running annually in the same cities, new plot lines are created and rotated through the tour. Because the target audience changes as children grow up, shows are often removed from the rotation for a few years, then return with some modifications.

In order of their creation, the &quot;Sesame Street Live&quot; shows have been:

<text>Nezahualcoyotl ( , ), &quot;Fasting Coyote&quot; (April 28, 1402 – June 4, 1472) was a scholar, philosopher (&quot;tlamatini&quot;), warrior, architect, poet and ruler (&quot;tlatoani&quot;) of the city-state of Texcoco in pre-Columbian era Mexico. Unlike other high-profile Mexican figures from the century preceding the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Nezahualcoyotl was not fully Mexica; his father&#x27;s people were the Acolhua, another Nahuan people settled in the eastern part of the Valley of Mexico, on the coast of Lake Texcoco. His mother, however, was the sister of Chimalpopoca, the Mexica king of Tenochtitlan. 

King Nezahualcoyotl is best remembered for his poetry; for his Hamlet-like biography as a dethroned prince with a victorious return, leading to the fall of Azcapotzalco and the rise of the Aztec Triple Alliance; and for leading important infrastructure projects, both in Texcoco and Tenochtitlan; and exceptional intelligence, enabling -- on the last day of his life -- the most devastating of his mind-games against Montezuma. According to accounts by his descendants and biographers, Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl and Juan Bautista Pomar, he had an experience of an &quot;Unknown, Unknowable Lord of All&quot; (which aligns, intriguingly, with &quot;I Am Who I Am,&quot; whom Moses had encountered in the Eastern Hemisphere). Nezahualcoyotl built an entirely empty temple to this God, in which no blood sacrifices of any kind were permitted, while allowing the standard sacrifices to continue elsewhere.

==Name==
The Nahuatl name Nezahualcoyotl is commonly translated as “hungry coyote” or “fasting coyote.” However, more accurately, it means &quot;coyote with a fasting collar,&quot; from &quot;nezahualli&quot;, a collar made out of bands of paper twisted together. It was worn by those fasting to show others that they shouldn&#x27;t be offered food.

==Early life==

Born Acolmiztli, he was the son of Ixtlilxochitl I and Matlalcihuatzin, the daughter of Huitzilihuitl. Though born heir to a throne, his youth was not marked by princely luxury. His father had set Texcoco against the powerful city of Azcapotzalco, ruled by the Tepanec. In 1418, when the young prince was fifteen, his father was assassinated.

The Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco, led by Tezozomoc, conquered Texcoco, and Acolmiztli had to flee into exile in Huexotzinco. After various adventures, during which he took the name Nezahualcoyotl, the prince returned to stay in Tenochtitlan in 1422. His aunts bribed the Tepanec king and allowed for him to be partially educated as a Mexica. His exposure to Mexica culture and politics would influence how he later governed Texcoco. After Tezozomoc&#x27;s son Maxtla became ruler of Azcapotzalco, Nezahualcoyotl returned to Texcoco, but had to go into exile a second time when he learned that Maxtla plotted against his life.

==The reconquest of Texcoco==

As the &quot;tlatoani&quot; Itzcoatl of Tenochtitlan requested help from the Huexotzincans against the Tepanecs, Nezahualcoyotl envisioned a single military force in order to fight the mighty kingdom of Azcapotzalco. After being offered support from insurgents inside Acolhuacan and rebel Tepanecs from Coyohuacan, Nezahualcoyotl joined the war. He called for a coalition consisting of many of the most important pre-Hispanic cities of the time: Tenochtitlan, Tlacopan, Tlatelolco, Huexotzingo, Tlaxcala and Chalco.

The war was declared a shared and single effort, and the coalition army of more than 100,000 men under the command of Nezahualcoyotl and other important &quot;tlatoque&quot; headed towards Azcapotzalco from the city of Calpulalpan. This began the military offensive that would reconquer Acolhuacan in 1428.

The campaign was divided into three parts. One army attacked Acolman to the north and the second Coatlinchan to the south. A contingent led by Nezahualcoyotl himself was intended to attack Acolhuacan, only after providing support, upon request, to the first two armies. The coalition conquered Acolman and Otumba, sacking them only due to the sudden Tepanec siege of Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco.

In a tactical move, the three armies united again and then divided into two. One of them, under Nezahualcoyotl, headed towards Texcoco, laying siege to Acolhuacan on its way, while the other attacked and destroyed Azcapotzalco. At the time the armies met again, Nezahualcoyotl reclaimed Texcoco and decided to conquer Acolhuacan, entering from the north while the Tenochca and Tlacopan allies coming from Azcapotzalco attacked from the south. The two armies simultaneously attacked Acolhuacan from two directions until they controlled the city&#x27;s main square.

After their victory, the coalition began a series of attacks on isolated Tepanec posts throughout the territory of Texcoco. The defeat of the Tepanecs and the total destruction of the kingdom of Azcapotzalco gave rise to the Aztec Triple Alliance between Texcoco, Tenochtitlan, and Tlacopan. Nezahualcoyotl was eventually crowned Tlatoani of Texcoco in 1431.

A decade later, eager to produce a noble heir, Nezahualcoyotl married Azcalxochitzin after the death of her first husband, King Cuahcuauhtzin of Tepechpan.

== Legal system ==

According to Motolinia, Nezahualcoyotl practiced his strict laws judiciously and imposed them on all his subjects. He purportedly killed four of his sons for their sexual relationships with his concubines. Cities conquered by the Aztec Empire paid tribute that was distributed among three kings. Fourteen cities in the region of Acolhuacan were under Nezahualcoyotl, including Otompan, Huexotla, Coatlichan, Chimalhuacan, Tepetlaoztoc, Chiauhtla, Tezoyucan, Teotihuacan, Acolman, Tepechpan, Chiconauhtlan, Xicotepec, Cuauhchinanco, and Tulantzino.

Nezahualcoyotl, himself half Mexica, adopted the Mexica religious and legal systems in Acolhuacan to help in the reconstruction of his city. Motolinia claims he enacted some eighty laws addressing issues such as treason, robbery, adultery, homicide, alcohol abuse, misuse of inheritances, and military misconduct. The Mapa Quinatzin depicts the hanging of a robber for stealing or breaking into a house.

==Achievements==

Revered as a sage and poet-king, Nezahualcoyotl gathered a group of followers called the &quot;tlamatini&quot;, generally translated as &quot;wise men.&quot; These men were scholars, artists, musicians and sculptors who pursued their art in the court of Texcoco.

Nezahualcoyotl is credited with cultivating what came to be known as Texcoco&#x27;s Golden Age, which brought the rule of law, scholarship and artistry to the city and set high standards that influenced surrounding cultures. Nezahualcoyotl designed a code of law based on the division of power, which created the councils of finance, war, justice and culture (the last actually called the &quot;Council of Music&quot;). Under his rule, Texcoco flourished as the intellectual center of the Triple Alliance and was home to an extensive library that, tragically, did not survive the Spanish conquest. He also established an academy of music and welcomed worthy entrants from all regions of Mesoamerica.

Texcoco has been called &quot;the Athens of the Western World,&quot; to quote the historian Lorenzo Boturini Bernaducci. Indeed, the remains of hilltop gardens, sculptures and a massive aqueduct system show the impressive engineering skills and aesthetic appreciation of his reign.
Many believe, however, that of all the creative intellects nurtured by this Texcocan &quot;Athens,&quot; by far the greatest belonged to the king himself. He is considered one of the great designers and architects of the pre-Hispanic era. He is said to have personally designed the &quot;albarrada de Nezahualcoyotl&quot; (&quot;dike of Nezahualcoyotl&quot;) to separate the fresh and brackish waters of Lake Texcoco, a system that was still in use over a century after his death.

==Legacy==
The date of Nezahualcoyotl&#x27;s death is recorded as being June 4, 1472. He was survived by many concubines and an estimated 110 children. He was succeeded by his son Nezahualpilli as &quot;tlatoani&quot; of Texcoco.

His great-grandson Juan Bautista Pomar is credited with the compilation of a collection of Nahuatl poems, &quot;Romances de los señores de Nueva España&quot;, and with a chronicle of the history of the Aztecs. The freshwater fish &quot;Xiphophorus nezahualcoyotl&quot; is named after Nezahualcoyotl. Nezahualcoyotl appears on the current 100 peso banknote of Mexico.

==Poetry==

One of Nezahualcoyotl&#x27;s historical legacies is as a poet, with a number of works in Classical Nahuatl written in the 16th and 17th centuries ascribed to him. These attributions are testament to the long lifespan of oral tradition, since Nezahualcoyotl died almost 50 years before the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and the poems were written down another fifty years after that. Juan Bautista de Pomar was a grandson of Nezahualcoyotl and likely wrote them from memory of the oral tradition.
Poems attributed to Nezahualcoyotl include:
*&quot;In chololiztli&quot; (The Flight)
*&quot;Ma zan moquetzacan&quot; (Stand Up!)
*&quot;Nitlacoya&quot; (I Am Sad)
*&quot;Xopan cuicatl&quot; (Song of Springtime)
*&quot;Ye nonocuiltonohua&quot; (I Am Wealthy)
*&quot;Zan yehuan&quot; (He Alone)
*&quot;Xon Ahuiyacan&quot; (Be Joyful)

<text>Northern storm petrels are seabirds in the genus Hydrobates in the family Hydrobatidae, part of the order Procellariiformes. The family was once lumped with the similar austral storm petrels in the combined storm petrels, but have been split, as they were not closely related. These smallest of seabirds feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.

The northern storm petrels are found in the Northern Hemisphere, although some species around the Equator dip into the south. They are strictly pelagic, coming to land only when breeding. In the case of most species, little is known of their behaviour and distribution at sea, where they can be hard to find and harder to identify. They are colonial nesters, displaying strong philopatry to their natal colonies and nesting sites. Most species nest in crevices or burrows, and all but one species attend the breeding colonies nocturnally. Pairs form long-term, monogamous bonds and share incubation and chick-feeding duties. Like many species of seabirds, nesting is highly protracted, with incubation taking up to 50 days and fledging another 70 days after that.

Several species of storm petrel are threatened by human activities. One species, the Guadalupe storm petrel, is thought to have gone extinct. The principal threats to storm petrels are introduced species, particularly mammals, in their breeding colonies; many storm petrels habitually nest on isolated mammal-free islands and are unable to cope with predators such as rats and feral cats.

==Taxonomy==
The family Hydrobatidae was introduced with &quot;Hydrobates&quot; as the type genus by the Australian born ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1912. The background is complicated as the family Hydrobatidae had originally been introduced in 1849 with &quot;Hydrobata&quot; as the type genus by the French zoologist Côme-Damien Degland. &quot;Hydrobata&quot; had been erected in 1816 for species in the dipper family Cinclidae by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. In 1992 the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) suppressed the genus &quot;Hydrobata&quot; Vieillot, 1816. Under the rules of the ICZN the family Hydrobatidae Degland, 1849 thus became unavailable as the type genus had been suppressed. This cleared the way for the family Hydrobatidae introduced in 1912 by Mathews.

The genus &quot;Hydrobates&quot; was erected in 1822 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie. He listed two species but did not specify a type. In 1884 Spencer Baird, Thomas Brewer and Robert Ridgway designated the European storm petrel as the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot; hudro-&quot; meaning &quot;water-&quot; with &quot;batēs&quot; meaning &quot;walker&quot;.

In the past two subfamilies, the Hydrobatinae and Oceanitinae, were recognized within a single large family Hydrobatidae, but this has since been split with the elevation of the Oceanitidae to family status. The Oceanitidae, or austral storm petrels, are mostly found in southern waters (though Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel regularly migrates into the Northern Hemisphere). The Hydrobatidae, or northern storm petrels, are largely restricted to the Northern Hemisphere, although a few visit or breed a short distance south of the equator. The family Hydrobatidae originally included two genera &quot;Hydrobates&quot; and &quot;Oceanodroma&quot;. Cytochrome &quot;b&quot; DNA sequence analysis suggested that the family was paraphyletic and more accurately treated as two distinct families. A few fossil species have been found, with the earliest being from the Upper Miocene. In 2021, the IOC merged &quot;Hydrobates&quot; and &quot;Oceanodroma&quot; into the single genus &quot;Hydrobates&quot;, as the family was paraphyletic as previously defined.

The following cladogram shows the results of the phylogenetic analysis by Wallace et al. (2017).

== Species ==

One species, the Guadalupe storm petrel (&quot;O. macrodactyla&quot;), is possibly extinct.

In 2010, the International Ornithological Congress (IOC) added the Cape Verde storm petrel (&quot;O. jabejabe&quot;) to their list of accepted species (AS) splits, following Bolton et al. 2007. This species was split from the band-rumped storm petrel (&quot;O. castro&quot;). In 2016, the IOC added Townsend&#x27;s storm petrel (&quot;O. socorroensis&quot;) and Ainley&#x27;s storm petrel (&quot;O. cheimomnestes&quot;) to their list of AS splits, following Howell 2012. These species were split from Leach&#x27;s storm petrel (&quot;O. leucorhoa&quot;).

== Morphology and flight ==

Northern storm petrels are the smallest of all the seabirds, ranging in size from 13 to 25 cm in length. The Hydrobatidae have longer wings than the austral storm petrels, forked or wedge-shaped tails, and shorter legs. The legs of all storm petrels are proportionally longer than those of other Procellariiformes, but they are very weak and unable to support the bird&#x27;s weight for more than a few steps.

All but two of the Hydrobatidae are mostly dark in colour with varying amounts of white on the rump. Two species have different plumage entirely, the ringed storm petrel, which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed storm petrel, which has pale grey plumage. This is a notoriously difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species. They also consider that several national bird lists include species that have been incorrectly identified or have been accepted on inadequate evidence.

Storm petrels use a variety of techniques to aid flight. Most species occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water&#x27;s surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels, however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.

==Diet==
The diet of many storm petrels species is poorly known owing to difficulties in researching; overall, the family is thought to concentrate on crustaceans. Small fish, oil droplets, and molluscs are also taken by many species. Some species are known to be rather more specialised; the grey-backed storm petrel is known to concentrate on the larvae of goose barnacles.

Almost all species forage in the pelagic zone. Although storm petrels are capable of swimming well and often form rafts on the water&#x27;s surface, they do not feed on the water. Instead, feeding usually takes place on the wing, with birds hovering above or &quot;walking&quot; on the surface (see morphology) and snatching small morsels. Rarely, prey is obtained by making shallow dives under the surface.

Like many seabirds, storm petrels associate with other species of seabirds and marine mammal species to help obtain food. They may benefit from the actions of diving predators such as seals and penguins, which push prey up towards the surface while hunting, allowing the surface-feeding storm petrels to reach them.

==Distribution and movements==

The Hydrobatidae are mostly found in the Northern Hemisphere.

Several species of northern storm petrel undertake migrations after the breeding season, of differing lengths; long ones, such as Swinhoe&#x27;s storm petrel, which breeds in the west Pacific and migrates to the west Indian Ocean; or shorter ones, such as the black storm petrel, which nests in southern California and migrates down the coast of Central America as far south as Colombia. Some species, like Tristram&#x27;s storm petrel, are thought to be essentially sedentary and do not undertake any migrations away from their breeding islands.

==Breeding==
Storm petrels nest colonially, for the most part on islands, although a few species breed on the mainland, particularly Antarctica. Nesting sites are attended at night to avoid predators; the wedge-rumped storm petrels nesting in the Galapagos Islands are the exception to this rule and attend their nesting sites during the day. Storm petrels display high levels of philopatry, returning to their natal colonies to breed. In one instance, a band-rumped storm petrel was caught as an adult 2 m from its natal burrow. Storm petrels nest either in burrows dug into soil or sand, or in small crevices in rocks and scree. Competition for nesting sites is intense in colonies where storm petrels compete with other burrowing petrels, with shearwaters having been recorded killing storm petrels to occupy their burrows. Colonies can be extremely large and dense, with densities as high as 8 pairs/m2 for band-rumped storm petrels in the Galapagos and colonies 3.6 million strong for Leach&#x27;s storm petrel have been recorded.
Storm petrels are monogamous and form long-term pair bonds that last a number of years. Studies of paternity using DNA fingerprinting have shown that, unlike many other monogamous birds, infidelity (extra-pair mating) is very rare. As with the other Procellariiformes, a single egg is laid by a pair in a breeding season; if the egg fails, then usually no attempt is made to lay again (although it happens rarely). Both sexes incubate in shifts of up to six days. The egg hatches after 40 or 50 days; the young is brooded continuously for another 7 days or so before being left alone in the nest during the day and fed by regurgitation at night. Meals fed to the chick weigh around 10–20% of the parent&#x27;s body weight, and consist of both prey items and stomach oil. Stomach oil is an energy-rich (its calorific value is around 9.6 kcal/g) oil created by partly digested prey in a part of the fore gut known as the proventriculus. By partly converting prey items into stomach oil, storm petrels can maximise the amount of energy chicks receive during feeding, an advantage for small seabirds that can only make a single visit to the chick during a 24-hour period (at night). The typical age at which chicks fledge depends on the species, taking between 50 and 70 days. The time taken to hatch and raise the young is long for the bird&#x27;s size, but is typical of seabirds, which in general are K-selected, living much longer, delaying breeding for longer, and investing more effort into fewer young. The young leave their burrows around 62 days. They are independent almost at once and quickly disperse into the ocean. They return to their original colony after 2 or 3 years, but will not breed until at least 4 years old. Storm petrels have been recorded living as long as 30 years.

==Threats and conservation==

Several species of storm petrel are threatened by human activities. The Guadalupe storm petrel has not been observed since 1906 and most authorities consider it extinct. One species (the ashy storm petrel) is listed as endangered by the IUCN due to a 42% decline over 20 years. For the ringed storm petrel, even the sites of their breeding colonies remain a mystery.

Storm petrels face the same threats as other seabirds; in particular, they are threatened by introduced species. The Guadalupe storm petrel was driven to extinction by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation, which limits nesting opportunities, caused by introduced goats and pigs is also a problem, especially if it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.

==Cultural representation of the storm petrel==

&quot;Petrel&quot; is a diminutive form of &quot;Peter&quot;, a reference to Saint Peter; it was given to these birds because they sometimes appear to walk across the water&#x27;s surface. The more specific &quot;storm petrel&quot; or &quot;stormy petrel&quot; is a reference to their habit of hiding in the lee of ships during storms. Early sailors named these birds &quot;Mother Carey&#x27;s chickens&quot; because they were thought to warn of oncoming storms; this name is based on a corrupted form of &quot;Mater Cara&quot;, a name for the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Breton folklore holds that storm petrels are the spirits of sea-captains who mistreated their crew, doomed to spend eternity flying over the sea, and they are also held to be the souls of drowned sailors. A sailing superstition holds that the appearance of a storm petrel foretells bad weather. Sinister names from Britain and France include waterwitch, satanite, satanique, and &quot;oiseau du diable&quot;.

===Symbol of revolution===
The association of the storm petrel with turbulent weather has led to its use as a metaphor for revolutionary views, the epithet &quot;stormy petrel&quot; being applied by various authors to characters as disparate as a Roman tribune,
a Presbyterian minister in the early Carolinas,
an Afghan governor,
or an Arkansas politician. Russian revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky bore the epithet &quot;the Stormy Petrel of the Revolution&quot; (&quot;Буревестник Революции&quot;), presumably due to his authorship of the famous 1901 poem &quot;Song of the Stormy Petrel&quot;.

In &quot;Song of the Stormy Petrel&quot;, Gorki turned to the imagery of subantarctic avifauna to describe Russian society&#x27;s attitudes to the coming revolution. The storm petrel was depicted as unafraid of the coming storm –the revolution. This poem was called &quot;the battle anthem of the revolution&quot;, and earned Gorky himself the title of the &quot;Storm Petrel of the Revolution&quot;. 
While this English translation of the bird&#x27;s name may not be a very ornithologically accurate translation of the Russian &quot;burevestnik&quot; (буревестник), it is poetically appropriate, as &quot;burevestnik&quot; literally means &quot;the announcer of the storm&quot;. To honour Gorky and his work, the name &quot;Burevestnik&quot; was bestowed on a variety of institutions, locations, and products in the USSR.

The motif of the stormy petrel has a long association with revolutionary anarchism. Various groups adopted the bird&#x27;s name, either as a group identifier, as in the Spanish Civil War, or for their publications. &quot;Stormy Petrel&quot; was the title of a German anarchist paper of the late 19th century; it was also the name of a Russian exile anarchist communist group operating in Switzerland in the early 20th century. &quot;The Stormy Petrel&quot; (&quot;Burevestnik&quot;) was the title of the magazine of the Anarchist Communist Federation in Russia around the time of the 1905 revolution, and is still an imprint of the London group of the Anarchist Federation of Britain and Ireland. Writing in 1936, Emma Goldman referred to Buenaventura Durruti as &quot;this stormy petrel of the anarchist and revolutionary movement&quot;.

<text>Mayen-Koblenz is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the north of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Ahrweiler, Neuwied, Westerwaldkreis, district-free Koblenz, Rhein-Lahn, Rhein-Hunsrück, Cochem-Zell, and Vulkaneifel.

==History==
The district was created in 1973 when the two districts, Mayen and Koblenz, were merged.

The district has been &#x27;twinned&#x27; with the Borough of Waverley in Surrey in southern England since 1982.

==Geography==
The two main rivers of the district are the Rhine and the Moselle, which join at the &quot;Deutsches Eck&quot; in Koblenz. In the west of the district are the Eifel mountains. These also include the large lake, the &quot;Laacher See&quot;, a volcanic caldera formed 12000 years ago.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms combine the elements of the two precursor districts. The tree, a &quot;Maie&quot;, is taken from the Mayen district. The wavy line represents the two rivers Rhine and Moselle. The crown is a reference to the fact that in Rhens the Councils of Electors took place to choose the emperors and kings of the Holy Roman Empire.

==Towns and municipalities==

== Castles and palaces ==
The county has many castles and palaces:

* Eltz Castle, probably the best known German castle
* Trutzeltz Castle near Eltz Castle
* Schloss Bürresheim
* Genovevaburg in Mayen
* Oberburg, Kobern in Kobern with the Romanesque St. Matthew&#x27;s Chapel
* Niederburg, Kobern in Kobern
* Schloss Liebieg in Gondorf
* Oberburg in Gondorf, family seat of the von der Leyen family
* Thurant Castle above Alken (Mosel)
* Ehrenburg near Brodenbach
* Sayn Castle and Schloss Sayn in Bendorf-Sayn
* Bischofstein Castle on the Moselle near Burgen
* Wernerseck Castle near Ochtendung
* Löwenburg and Philippsburg near Monreal
* Virneburg Castle
* Schloss Bassenheim in Bassenheim
* Namedy Castle in Andernach
* Andernach Castle in Andernach

<doc id="224148" wikidata="Q224655" url="?curid=224148" title="Cinerama">
<text>Cinerama is a widescreen process that originally projected images simultaneously from three synchronized 35mm projectors onto a huge, deeply curved screen, subtending 146-degrees of arc. The trademarked process was marketed by the Cinerama corporation. It was the first of several novel processes introduced during the 1950s when the movie industry was reacting to competition from television. Cinerama was presented to the public as a theatrical event, with reserved seating and printed programs, and audience members often dressed in their best attire for the evening.

The Cinerama projection screen, rather than being a continuous surface like most screens, is made of hundreds of individual vertical strips of standard perforated screen material, each about  inch (~22  millimeters) wide, with each strip angled to face the audience, to prevent light scattered from one end of the deeply curved screen from reflecting across the screen and washing out the image on the opposite end. The display is accompanied by a high-quality, seven-track discrete, directional, surround-sound system.

The original system involved shooting with three synchronized cameras sharing a single shutter. This process was later abandoned in favor of a system using a single camera and 70mm (~2.75 inch) prints. The latter system lost the 146-degree field of view of the original three-strip system, and its resolution was markedly lower. Three-strip Cinerama did not use anamorphic lenses, although two of the systems used to produce the 70mm prints (Ultra Panavision 70 and Super Technirama 70) &quot;did&quot; employ anamorphic lenses, 35mm (~1.38 in) anamorphic reduction prints were produced for exhibition in theatres with anamorphic CinemaScope-compatible projection lenses.

==History==
===Process and production===
Cinerama was invented by Fred Waller (18861954) and languished in the laboratory for several years before Waller, joined by Hazard &quot;Buzz&quot; Reeves, brought it to the attention of Lowell Thomas who, first with Mike Todd and later with Merian C. Cooper, produced a commercially viable demonstration of Cinerama that opened on Broadway on September 30, 1952. The film, titled &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot;, was received with enthusiasm. It was the outgrowth of many years of development. A forerunner was the triple-screen final sequence in the silent &quot;Napoléon&quot; (1927) directed by Abel Gance; Gance&#x27;s classic was considered lost in the 1950s, however, known of only by hearsay, and Waller could not have viewed it. Waller had earlier developed an eleven-projector system called &quot;Vitarama&quot; at the Petroleum Industry exhibit in the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. A five-camera version, the Waller Gunnery Trainer, was used during the Second World War.

The word &quot;Cinerama&quot; combines cinema with panorama, the origin of all the &quot;-orama&quot; neologisms (the word &quot;panorama&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;pan&quot;, meaning &quot;all&quot;, and &quot;orama&quot;, which translates into &quot;that which is seen&quot;, a &quot;sight&quot;, or a &quot;spectacle&quot;). It was suggested in the documentary &quot;Cinerama Adventure&quot; (2002) that &quot;Cinerama&quot; could have been an intentional anagram of the word &quot;American;&quot; but Dick Babish, present at the meeting when it was named, says this is &quot;purely accidental, however delightful.&quot;

The photographic system used three interlocked 35 mm cameras equipped with 27 mm lenses, approximately the focal length of the human eye. Each camera photographed one-third of the picture shooting in a crisscross pattern, the right camera shooting the left part of the image, the left camera shooting the right part of the image, and the center camera shooting straight ahead. The three cameras were mounted as one unit, set at 48 degrees to each other. A single rotating shutter in front of the three lenses assured simultaneous exposure on each of the films. The three angled cameras photographed an image that was not only three times as wide as a standard film but covered 146 degrees of arc, close to the human field of vision, including peripheral vision. The image was photographed six sprocket holes high, rather than the usual four used in conventional 35 mm processes. The picture was photographed and projected at 26 frames per second rather than the usual 24 FPS.

According to film historian Martin Hart, in the original Cinerama system &quot;the camera aspect ratio [was] 2.59:1&quot; with an &quot;optimum screen image, with no architectural constraints, [of] about 2.65:1, with the extreme top and bottom cropped slightly to hide anomalies&quot;. He further comments on the unreliability of &quot;numerous websites and other resources that will tell you that Cinerama had an aspect ratio of up to 3:1.&quot;

In theaters, Cinerama film was projected from three projection booths arranged in the same crisscross pattern as the cameras. They projected onto a deeply curved screen, the outer thirds of which were made of over 1,100 strips of material mounted on &quot;louvers&quot; like a vertical Venetian blind, to prevent light projected to each end of the screen from reflecting to the opposite end and washing out the image. This was a big-ticket, reserved-seats spectacle, and the Cinerama projectors were adjusted carefully and operated skillfully. To prevent adjacent images from creating an over-illuminated vertical band where they overlapped on the screen, vibrating combs in the projectors, called &quot;jiggolos,&quot; alternately blocked the image from one projector and then the other; the overlapping area thus received no more total illumination than the rest of the screen, and the rapidly alternating images within the overlap smoothed out the visual transition between adjacent image &quot;panels.&quot; Great care was taken to match color and brightness when producing the prints. Nevertheless, the seams between panels were usually noticeable. Optical limitations with the design of the camera itself meant that if distant scenes joined perfectly, closer objects did not. (parallax error). A nearby object might split into two as it crossed the seams. To avoid calling attention to the seams, scenes were often composed with unimportant objects such as trees or posts at the seams, and action was blocked to center actors within panels. This gave a distinctly &quot;triptych-like&quot; appearance to the composition even when the seams themselves were not obvious. It was often necessary to have actors in different sections &quot;cheat&quot; where they looked to appear to be looking at each other in the final projected picture. Enthusiasts say the seams were not obtrusive; detractors disagree. Lowell Thomas, an investor in the company with Mike Todd, was still raving about the process in his memoirs thirty years later.

====Sound system====
In addition to the visual impact of the image, Cinerama was one of the first processes to use multitrack magnetic sound. The system, developed by Hazard E. Reeves, one of the Cinerama investors, played back from a fully coated 35 mm magnetic film with seven tracks of sound targeting a speaker layout similar to the more modern SDDS. There were five speakers behind the screen, two on the side and back of the auditorium with a sound engineer directing the sound between the surround speakers according to a script. The projectors and sound system were synchronized by a system using selsyn motors.

===Drawbacks===
The Cinerama system had some obvious drawbacks. If one of the films should break, it had to be repaired with a black slug exactly equal to the missing footage. Otherwise, the corresponding frames would have had to be cut from the other three films (the other two picture films plus the soundtrack film) in order to preserve synchronization. The use of zoom lenses was impossible since the three images would no longer match. Perhaps the greatest limitation of the process is that the picture looks natural only from within a rather limited &quot;sweet spot.&quot; Viewed from outside the sweet spot, the picture can look distorted. Furthermore, while the screen was a continuous curve, the projected image itself was a polygonal triptych, which often resulted in the combined image appearing bent or creased. Finally, any mis-alignment of the two intersections of the three films was quite noticeable which prompted the use of a vertical element at these intersections (tree, lamp pole, etc) to hide this flaw.

The system also required a bit of improvisation on the part of the film producers. It was not possible to film any scene where any part of the scene was close to the camera, as the fields of view no longer met exactly. Further, any close-up material had a noticeable bend in it at the joins. It was also difficult to film actors talking to each other where both were in shot, because when they looked at each other when filmed, the resultant image showed the actors appearing to look past each other, particularly if they appeared on different films. Early directors sidestepped this latter problem by only shooting one actor at a time and cutting between them. Later directors worked out where to have the actors looking to create a natural shot. Each actor was required not to look at their fellow actor, but at a predetermined cue place instead.

Finally, the three individual films would jitter and weave slightly as the films moved through the projectors. This normal frame-to-frame movement is typically imperceptible to cinema audiences where only a single projector is in use. However, in Cinerama, this resulted in the center picture constantly moving slightly relative to each of the side pictures. The shifting displacements were perceivable at the two points where the center picture met the side pictures, resulting in what appeared to many viewers to be jittering vertical lines at one-third and two-thirds of the way across the screen as the two touching images constantly moved around relative to each other. Cinerama projectors used a device to slightly blur the join lines to make the jitter less noticeable. Future systems such as Circle-Vision 360° would correct for this by having masked areas between the screens. The jitters continued, but viewers were less aware of them with the adjoining pictures no longer so close together.

The impact these films had on the big screen cannot be assessed from television or video, or even from &#x27;scope prints, which marry the three images together with the seams clearly visible. Because they were designed to be seen on a curved screen, the geometry looks distorted on television; someone walking from left to right appears to approach the camera at an angle, move away at an angle, and then repeat the process on the other side of the screen.

===Premiere===
The first Cinerama film, &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot;, premiered on September 30, 1952 at the Broadway Theatre in New York City. &quot;The New York Times&quot; judged it to be front-page news. Notables attending included New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, violinist Fritz Kreisler, James A. Farley, Metropolitan Opera manager Rudolf Bing, NBC chairman David Sarnoff, CBS chairman William S. Paley,; Broadway composer Richard Rodgers, and Hollywood mogul Louis B. Mayer.

In &quot;The New York Times&quot; a few days after the system premiered, film critic Bosley Crowther wrote:

Somewhat the same sensations that the audience in Koster and Bial&#x27;s Music Hall must have felt on that night, years ago, when motion pictures were first publicly flashed on a large screen were probably felt by the people who witnessed the first public showing of Cinerama the other night...the shrill screams of the ladies and the pop-eyed amazement of the men when the huge screen was opened to its full size and a thrillingly realistic ride on a roller-coaster was pictured upon it, attested to the shock of the surprise. People sat back in spellbound wonder as the scenic program flowed across the screen. It was really as though most of them were seeing motion pictures for the first time...the effect of Cinerama in this its initial display is frankly and exclusively &quot;sensational,&quot; in the literal sense of that word.

While observing that the system &quot;may be hailed as providing a new and valid entertainment thrill,&quot; Crowther expressed some skeptical reserve, saying &quot;the very size and sweep of the Cinerama screen would seem to render it impractical for the story-telling techniques now employed in film...It is hard to see how Cinerama can be employed for intimacy. But artists found ways to use the movie. They may well give us something brand-new here.&quot;

A technical review by Waldemar Kaempffert published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the same day hailed the system. He praised the stereophonic sound system and noted that &quot;the fidelity of the sounds was irreproachable. Applause in La Scala sounded like the clapping of hands and not like pieces of wood slapped together&quot;. He noted, however, that &quot;There is nothing new about these stereophonic sound effects. The Bell Telephone Laboratories and Professor Harold Burris-Meyer of Stevens Institute of Technology demonstrated the underlying principles years ago.&quot; Kaempffert also noted:

There is no question that Waller has made a notable advance in cinematography. But it must be said that at the sides of his gigantic screen there is some distortion more noticeable in some parts of the house than in others. The three projections were admirably blended, yet there were visible bands of demarcation on the screen.

===Venues===
Although existing theatres were adapted to show Cinerama films, in 1961 and 1962 the non-profit Cooper Foundation of Lincoln, Nebraska, designed and built three near-identical circular &quot;super-Cinerama&quot; theaters in Denver, Colorado; St. Louis Park, Minnesota (a Minneapolis suburb); and Omaha, Nebraska. They were considered the finest venues in which to view Cinerama films. The theaters were designed by architect Richard L. Crowther of Denver, a fellow of the American Institute of Architects.

The first such theater, the Cooper Theater, built in Denver, featured a 146-degree louvered screen (measuring ), 814 seats, courtesy lounges on the sides of the theatre for relaxation during intermission (including concessions and smoking facilities), and a ceiling which routed air and heating through small vent slots to inhibit noise from the building&#x27;s ventilation equipment. It was demolished in 1994 to make way for a Barnes &amp; Noble.

The second, also called the Cooper Theater, was built in St. Louis Park at 5755 Wayzata Boulevard. The last film presented there was &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; in January 1991. At that time the Cooper was considered the &quot;flagship&quot; in the Plitt theatre chain. Efforts were made to preserve the theatre, but at the time it did not qualify for national or state historical landmark status (as it was not more than fifty years old) nor were there local preservation laws. It was torn down in 1992. An office complex with a TGI Friday&#x27;s on the west end of the property is there today.

The third super-Cinerama, the Indian Hills Theater, was built in Omaha, Nebraska. It closed on September 28, 2000 as a result of the bankruptcy of Carmike Cinemas and the final film presented was the rap music-drama &quot;Turn It Up.&quot; The theater was demolished on August 20, 2001.

A fourth, the Kachina Cinerama Theater, was built in Scottsdale, Arizona by Harry L. Nace Theatres on Scottsdale Road opened on November 10, 1960. It seated 600 people. It later became a Harkins theater, then closed in 1989 to make way for the Scottsdale Galleria. Venues outside the United States included the Regent Plaza cinema in Melbourne, Australia, which was adapted for Cinerama in 1960 to show &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; and &quot;Seven Wonders of the World&quot;. The Imperial Theatre in Montreal and the Glendale in Toronto were the Canadian homes for Cinerama.

A Cinerama temporary venue was built on the location of the 1958 World Fair in Brussels, for the whole duration of the fair, from April until October 1958.

&quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; received its London premiere on September 30, 1954, at the Casino Cinerama Theatre (now the Prince Edward Theatre), Old Compton Street, formerly a live theatre. The film ran for 16 months and was followed by the other three-strip travelogues. &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; had its World Premiere at the Casino on November 1, 1962, and ran until April 1965 after which the Casino switched to 70mm single lens Cinerama. London had two other three-strip venues, making it the only city in the world with three Cinerama theatres. These were the Coliseum Cinerama, from July 1963, and the Royalty Cinerama from November 1963, like the Casino, both converted live venues. The Coliseum played only one film in three-strip (&quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot;) before switching to a 70mm single lens in December 1963, and the Royalty had two runs of Brothers Grimm separated by a run of &quot;The Best of Cinerama&quot; before also switching to 70mm single lens in mid-1964. These London venues were directly operated by Cinerama themselves; elsewhere in the UK three-strip Cinerama venues were operated by the two main UK circuits, ABC at ABC Bristol Road, Birmingham and Coliseum, Glasgow, Rank at Gaumont, Birmingham, and Queens, Newcastle and by independents at the Park Hall, Cardiff, Theatre Royal, Manchester and Abbey, Liverpool. Most of these conversions of existing cinemas came just as Cinerama was switching to single lenses and thus had short lives as three-strip venues before switching to 70mm.

Roman Cinerama Theater (now Isetann Cinerama Recto) at Quezon Boulevard in Recto, Manila and Nation Cinerama Theater in Araneta Center, Quezon City were the only Cinerama theaters built in the Philippines in the 1960s. Both theaters are now defunct as Roman Super Cinerama burned down in the late 1970s and became Isetann Cinerama Recto in 1988 while Nation Cinerama closed down in the early 1970s it is now Manhattan Parkview Residences built by Megaworld Corporation.

The last Cinerama theater built was the Southcenter Theatre in 1970, opening near the Southcenter Mall of Tukwila, Washington. It closed in 2001.

Cinerama also purchased RKO-Stanley Warner (consisting of theaters formerly owned by Warner Bros. and RKO Pictures) in 1970.

===Stanley Warner===
Stanley Warner Corporation acquired 35 percent of the company—as well as the exhibition, production and distribution rights to Cinerama—in 1953 during the production of &quot;Seven Wonders of the World&quot;, which was planned as the follow-up feature.

Rising costs of making three-camera widescreen films caused Cinerama to stop making such films in their original form shortly after the first release of &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. The use of Ultra Panavision 70 for certain scenes (such as the river raft sequence) later printed onto the three Cinerama panels, proved that a more or less satisfactory wide-screen image could be photographed without the three cameras. Consequently, Cinerama discontinued the three film process, except for a single theater (McVickers&#x27; Cinerama Theatre in Chicago) showing &quot;Cinerama&#x27;s Russian Adventure&quot;, an American-Soviet co-production culled from footage of several Soviet films shot in the rival Soviet three-film format known as Kinopanorama in 1966.

Cinerama continued through the rest of the 1960s as a brand name used initially with the Ultra Panavision 70 widescreen process (which yielded a similar 2.76 aspect ratio to the original Cinerama, although it did not simulate the 146-degree field of view). Optically &quot;rectified&quot; prints and special lenses were used to project the 70 mm prints onto the curved screen. The films shot in Ultra Panavision for single lens Cinerama presentation were &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965), &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), &quot;The Hallelujah Trail&quot; (1965) and &quot;Khartoum&quot; (1966).

The less wide but still spectacular Super Panavision 70 was used to film the Cinerama presentations &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966); &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), which also featured scenes shot in Todd-AO and MCS-70); &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (1968); and &quot;Krakatoa, East of Java&quot; (1969), which also featured scenes shot in Todd-AO.

The other 70 mm systems used for single film Cinerama (Sovscope 70 and MCS-70) were similar to Super Panavision 70. Some films were shot in the somewhat lower resolution Super Technirama 70 process for Cinerama release, including &quot;Circus World&quot; (1964) and &quot;Custer of the West&quot; (1967).

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Cinerama name was used as a film distribution company, ironically reissuing single strip 70 mm and 35 mm Cinemascope reduction prints of &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; (1972).

==Extant venues==
In recent years, surviving and new Cinerama prints have been screened at the following venues:
* The Pictureville Cinema at the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, England, beginning in June 1993 As of 2023, the Pictureville Cinema continues to hold periodic screenings of three-projector Cinerama movies.
* The New Neon Cinema in Dayton, Ohio from 1996 to 2000, presented by The Cinerama Preservation Society, Inc.
* The refurbished Seattle Cinerama in Seattle, from 1999 to 2020. In 1998, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen purchased Seattle&#x27;s Martin Cinerama, which then underwent a major restoration/upgrade to become the Seattle Cinerama. In 2023, the theater was purchased by the Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF) and reopened on December 14, 2023 as SIFF Cinema Downtown due to trademark issues with the &quot;Cinerama&quot; name.
* Pacific Theatres&#x27; Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, from 2002 to 2020. The Cinerama Dome was designed for the three-projector system but never actually had it installed until recent years as it opened with the first of the single film 70 mm Cinerama films, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963).
* Cinerama restorationist and former Canadian broadcast engineer, Tom H. March&#x27;s Calgary basement.
* Biograf Panora, Malmö

==Legacy==
The modern Cinerama company exists as an entity of the Pacific Theatres chain.

&quot;Cinerama Adventure&quot; (2003), a documentary directed by David Strohmaier, looked at the history of the Cinerama process, as well as digitally recreating the Cinerama experience via clips of true Cinerama films (using transfers from original Cinerama prints). Turner Entertainment (via Warner Bros.) has struck new Cinerama prints of &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962) for exhibition in true Cinerama theatres around the world.

In 2008, a Blu-ray disc of &quot;How The West Was Won&quot; was released, offering a recreation of Cinerama for home viewing. The three Cinerama images were digitally stitched together so that the resulting image does not have the visible seams of older copies. Furthermore, as a second viewing option, 3D mapping technology was used to produce an image that approximates the curved screen, called &quot;SmileBox&quot;.

Since then, other Cinerama films, including &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot;, &quot;The Golden Head&quot;, and &quot;South Seas Adventure&quot; have also had &quot;SmileBox&quot; edition blu ray home-media releases.

On January 14, 2012, an original Cinerama camera was used to film a sequence at the Lasky-DeMille Barn, the original home to Famous Players–Lasky, later to be renamed Paramount Pictures. This was the first film photographed in the Cinerama process in almost 50 years. This sequence is part of a 12-minute production filmed entirely in the three-panel process. The new film, &quot;In the Picture&quot;, was presented at a Cinerama festival at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, California on September 30, 2012.

==Cinerama successors==
Cinerama successors, Todd-AO, CinemaScope, and the various 70 mm formats, all attempted to equal or surpass its grandeur while avoiding its problems to greater or lesser degrees of success. The large format IMAX system continues the tradition, although its screen is taller and often less wide.

==Features==
All but two of the feature-length films produced using the original three-strip Cinerama process were travelogues or episodic documentaries such as &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; (1952), the first film shot in Cinerama. Other travelogues presented in Cinerama were &quot;Cinerama Holiday&quot; (1955), &quot;Seven Wonders of the World&quot; (1955), &quot;Search for Paradise&quot; (1957) and &quot;South Seas Adventure&quot; (1958). There was also one commercial short, &quot;Renault Dauphine&quot; (1960).

Even as the Cinerama travelogues were beginning to lose audiences in the late 50s, the spectacular travelogue &quot;Windjammer&quot; (1958) was released in a competing process called Cinemiracle which claimed to have less noticeable dividing lines on the screen thanks to the reflection of the side images off mirrors. (This also allowed all three projectors to be in the same booth.) Due to the small number of Cinemiracle theatres, specially converted prints of &quot;Windjammer&quot; were shown in Cinerama theaters in cities which did not have Cinemiracle theaters, and ultimately Cinerama bought up the process.

Only two films with traditional story lines were made, &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot; and &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. In order to make these films compatible with single film systems for later standard releases, they were shot at 24 frames/s, not the 26 frames/s of traditional Cinerama.

The following feature films have been advertised as being presented &quot;in Cinerama&quot;:

==&quot;Cinerama&quot; video stretching mode==
RCA uses the word &quot;Cinerama&quot; to refer to a display mode which fills a 16:9 video screen with 4:3 video with, in the words of the manufacturer, &quot;little distortion.&quot; Manuals for products offering this mode give no detailed explanation. One online posting says it consists of &quot;a slight cropping at the top &amp; bottom combined with a slight stretch at only the sides,&quot; and praises it. The posting suggests that other vendors provide a similar function under different names. Mitsubishi calls it &quot;stretch&quot; mode. The RCA Scenium TV also has a &quot;stretch mode&quot; as well as a 4:3 picture stretched straight across.

There is no obvious connection between this video mode and any of the Cinerama motion picture processes. It is not clear why the name is used unless the nonlinear stretch alludes to a curved screen. (Ironically, some widescreen cinema processes—not Cinerama—displayed a fault known as &quot;anamorphic mumps,&quot; which consisted of a lateral stretch of objects closer to the camera).

In the U.S., RCA does not appear to have registered the word Cinerama as a trademark; conversely, a number of trademarks on Cinerama, e.g. SN 74270575, are still &quot;live&quot; and held by Cinerama, Inc.
