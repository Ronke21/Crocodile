<text>Jacquelyn Davette &quot;Jaci&quot; Velasquez (; born October 15, 1979) is an American actress and contemporary Christian and Latin pop singer and songwriter, performing in both English and Spanish.

Velasquez has sold almost three million albums in the US, recorded three Platinum and three Gold albums, and recorded 16 singles that hit No. 1 plus six more that entered the top 10. She received a Latin Billboard Music Award in 2002 for her album Mi Corazón, eight Dove Awards, including Best New Artist and Female Vocalist of the Year, as well as three Grammy nominations, and an American Music Award nomination in the category of &quot;Favorite Latin Artist&quot; in 2002.

From 2010 to 2016, Velasquez co-hosted “The Family-Friendly Morning Show”, a syndicated morning radio program with Doug Griffin.

==Biography==
===Early life and early music career===
Velasquez was born in Houston and is of Mexican, Spanish, Arab, Scottish, French, and Jewish descent. She grew up in an evangelical church where her parents were both singers and pastors. Although she has described herself as a &quot;non-denominational&quot; Christian, she later said in an interview with Morris Cerullo, &quot;you&#x27;re talking to an Assemblies of God&#x27;s girl&quot;.

At the age of 9, she began traveling with her father, who by that time was a full-time singing evangelist. She began by singing backup and then later sang solo, releasing three independent records between 1988 and 1992: &quot;My Favorite Songs&quot;, &quot;Help Me&quot;, and &quot;Keep the Fire Burning&quot;. It was while on the road that she was discovered by a representative of Myrrh Records.

===Breakthrough music career===
16-year-old Velasquez released her breakthrough album &quot;Heavenly Place&quot; on May 13, 1996; five of its songs became No. 1 hits. The album was later certified platinum. She was distinguished as the fastest selling solo debut recording artist in her genre and the first solo artist in Christian music history to reach gold status with a debut album. Since then she released seven more English-language albums, two of which were certified Gold. Five Latin albums garnishing amazing success with Llegar A Ti going double-platinum and Mi Corazón going platinum. She produced sixteen No. 1 Christian radio hits and six other top-10 singles, and has won nine Dove awards, including New Artist of the Year and two Female Vocalist of the Year wins. Velasquez has also done ad campaigns for Pepsi, Target, Doritos, John Freida&#x27;s Frizz-Ease hair products, and Helzberg Diamonds.

In 1998, she signed to Sony Discos for a four-album deal and was introduced to Rudy Pérez, who produced her first Spanish-language crossover album &quot;Llegar a Ti&quot; which topped the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart, the first Christian track to top that chart of its kind. This album enabled her to achieve crossover success by building a fan base among Hispanics. Her first single, &quot;Llegar a Ti,&quot; topped the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks and became the first Christian song to top that chart. She received a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the song.

In 2001, she released her second Spanish-language album, &quot;Mi Corazón&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Como Se Cura Una Herida,&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks and became one of the biggest singles of the year, receiving multiple award nominations and wins. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Album. &quot;Como Se Cura Una Herida&quot; charted at No. 1 simultaneously with the song &quot;Adore&quot; at No. 1 on the CCM (Inspirational) chart giving Velasquez two simultaneous No. 1s in two different markets.

Her Latin music credits includes five Spanish-language releases, two No. 1 Latin &quot;Billboard&quot; Singles, two Platinum albums, a Premio Lo Nuestro Award for New Artist of the Year, two &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, and four Dove Awards for Spanish Language Album of the Year. In September 2008, she was chosen by the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of International Information Programs as one of the 15 Prominent Hispanic-Americans in the Arts in America.

In August 2011, Velasquez signed with a new label, Inpop Records, and her album, &quot;Diamond&quot;, was released on February 7, 2012. She released her first Spanish-language lullaby album, &quot;Buenas Noches Mi Sol&quot;, in 2012 with Fisher-Price. She released a new project on March 31, 2017, through Integrity Music, consisting of an English-language album, &quot;Trust&quot;, and the Spanish-language version, &quot;Confío&quot;. At the 48th Dove Awards, &quot;Confío&quot; won Spanish Language Album of the Year

===Acting career===
Velasquez made her acting debut in the 2003 film &quot;Chasing Papi&quot;, which also featured Sofia Vergara, Roselyn Sanchez, and Eduardo Verastegui, as well as Nicole Scherzinger in a cameo role. It was released nationwide in the U.S. in April 2003. The movie reached No. 11 at the box office grossing $6 million worldwide. Velasquez also starred in the Christian films &quot;The Encounter&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem Countdown&quot;, both released in 2011.

In November 2010, Velasquez began co-hosting the &quot;Family Friendly Morning Show&quot; with Doug Griffin after being a guest host for several months. The show aired on over 100 U.S. radio stations for four hours each weekday morning. In 2016, she played the drama teacher Mrs. Diaz in &quot;I&#x27;m Not Ashamed&quot;, a 2016 biographical drama film which is based on the journals of Rachel Joy Scott.

==Personal life==
Velasquez married Darren Potuck, of the band AutoVaughn, on August 16, 2003. They were divorced in 2005.

On December 17, 2006, she married Nic Gonzales in a private ceremony in Austin, Texas. Gonzales is a member of Salvador, a Christian group with whom she had been touring. Their first son Zealand was born in 2007 and their second son Soren in 2009.

Velasquez and her husband were featured in an episode of the home remodeling reality TV show &quot;Renovation Realities&quot; which aired December 6, 2014, on the DIY Network.

<text>The MSP430 is a mixed-signal microcontroller family from Texas Instruments, first introduced on 14 February 1992. Built around a CPU, the MSP430 was designed for low power consumption, embedded applications and low cost.

==Features==
The fundamental feature of the MSP430 is low power consumption. The first MSP430s (MSP430C3xx) had a consumption around 400 uA/MHz and less than 2 uA in low-power mode with active basic timer and LCD driver. The more recent MSPs (MSP430FR5xx) have active mode consumption around 100-120 uA/MHz and 500 nA in low-power mode with active RTC. The consumption of the CPU itself is less than 32 uA/MHz. The MSP430FR series, which use FRAM instead of a flash, also allow fast writing to a non-volatile memory without additional power requirements.

The MSP430s use up to seven different low-power modes. The wake-up times differ on the mode and MSP430 generation. The fastest MSP430-family processors have wake-up times under 1 microsecond.

The MSP430s can run up to 25 MHz, while register-to-register operations take 1 cycle per instruction. The MSP430 family has more than 550 types, not counted package variants. There are microcontrollers with 0.5-512 kB flash or 0.5-256 kB FRAM and up to 66 kB RAM.

The device comes in a variety of generations featuring the usual peripherals:

* Internal oscillator,
* Timer including pulse-width modulation (PWM),
* Watchdog timer,
* USART,
* Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus,
* Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C),
* Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) options:
** 10/12/14-bit successive-approximation ADC
** 16/24-bit delta sigma ADC
** Internal analog comparator with digital timers
*** Can measure resistor-capacitor slope charging time
* Brownout reset circuitry.

Some less usual peripheral options include on-chip operational amplifiers (op-amp) for signal conditioning, 12-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC), liquid crystal display (LCD) driver, hardware multiplier, USB, and direct memory access (DMA) for ADC results. Apart from some older erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM, such as MSP430E3xx) and high volume mask ROM (MSP430Cxxx) versions, all of the devices are in-system programming enabled via Joint Test Action Group (JTAG), full four-wire or Spy-Bi-Wire), a built in bootstrapping loader (BSL) using UART such as RS-232, or USB on devices with USB support. No BSL is included in F20xx, G2xx0, G2xx1, G2xx2, or I20xx family devices.

===Memory limitations===
There are, however, limits that preclude its use in more complex embedded systems. The MSP430 does not have an external memory bus, so it is limited to on-chip memory, up to 512 KB flash memory and 66 KB random-access memory (RAM), which may be too small for applications needing large buffers or data tables. Also, although it has a DMA controller, it is very difficult to use it to move data off the chip due to a lack of a DMA output strobe.

==MSP430 generations==
Six general generations of MSP430 processors exist. In order of development, they are: &#x27;3xx generation, &#x27;1xx generation, &#x27;4xx generation, &#x27;2xx generation, &#x27;5xx generation, and &#x27;6xx generation. The digit after the generation identifies the model (generally higher model numbers are larger and more capable), the third digit identifies the amount of memory included, and the fourth, if present, identifies a minor model variant. The most common variation is a different on-chip analog-to-digital converter.

The 3xx and 1xx generations are limited to a 16-bit address space. In the later generations this was expanded to include &#x27;430X&#x27; instructions that allow a 20-bit address space. As happened with other processor architectures (e.g. the processor of the PDP-11), extending the addressing range beyond the 16-bit word size introduced some peculiarities and inefficiencies for programs larger than 64 KB.

In the following list, it helps to think of the typical 200 mA·Hr capacity of a CR2032 lithium coin cell as 200,000 μA·Hr, or 22.8 μA·year. Thus, considering only the CPU draw, such a battery could supply a 0.7 μA current draw for 32 years. (In reality, battery self-discharge would reduce this number.)

The significance of the &quot;RAM retention&quot; vs the &quot;real-time clock mode&quot; is that in real time clock mode the CPU can go to sleep with a clock running which will wake it up at a specified future time. In RAM retention mode, some external signal is required to wake it, e.g., input/output (I/O) pin signal or SPI slave receive interrupt.

===MSP430x1xx series===
The MSP430x1xx Series is the first generation with flash memory. They are generally more capable than the &#x27;3xx generation, but without an embedded LCD controller. These flash- or ROM-based ultra-low-power MCUs offer 8 MIPS, 1.8–3.6 V operation, up to 60 KB flash, and a wide range of analog and digital peripherals.

===MSP430F2xx series===
The MSP430F2xx Series are similar to the &#x27;1xx generation, but operate at even lower power, support up to 16 MHz operation, and have a more accurate (±2%) on-chip clock that makes it easier to operate without an external crystal. These flash-based ultra-low power devices offer 1.8–3.6 V operations. It includes the very-low power oscillator (VLO), internal pull-up/pull-down resistors, and low-pin count options.

The MSP430x3xx Series is the oldest generation, released between 1995 and 1998. The MSP430 was designed as a successor to TSS400 for battery-powered metering instruments. All MSP430x3xx had an embedded LCD controller and also a digital
controlled oscillator (DCO) with frequency-locked loop (FLL) which provided a stable system clock (1 to 4 MHz) using a low-frequency crystal (32 kHz). This generation does not support EEPROM memory, only mask ROM and UV-eraseable and one-time programmable EPROM. Later generations provide only flash memory and mask ROM options. These devices offer 2.5–5.5 V operation, up to 32 KB ROM.

===Other MSP430 families===
More families within MSP430 include Fixed Function, Automotive, and Extended Temp parts.

Fixed Function:
The MSP430BQ1010 16-bit microcontroller is an advanced fixed-function device that forms the control and communications unit on the receiver side for wireless power transfer in portable applications. MSP430BQ1010 complies with the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) specification. For more information, see Contactless Power.

Automotive:
Automotive MSP430 microcontrollers (MCUs) from Texas Instruments (TI) are 16-bit, RISC-based, mixed-signal processors that are AEC-Q100 qualified and suitable for automotive applications in environments up to 105 °C ambient temperature. LIN compliant drivers for the MSP430 MCU provided by IHR GmbH.

Extended Temp:
MSP430 devices are very popular in harsh environments such as industrial sensing for their low power consumption and innovative analog integration. Some harsh environment applications include transportation/automotive, renewable energy, military/space/avionics, mineral exploration, industrial, and safety &amp; security.

:*Device Definitions:

:**Q1: Automotive Q100 qualified -40 °C to 105 °C
:**T: Extended temperature -40 °C to 105 °C applications

Note that when the flash size is over 64K words (128 KBytes), instruction addresses can no longer be encoded in just two bytes. This change in pointer size causes some incompatibilities with previous parts.

==Peripherals==
The MSP430 peripherals are generally easy to use, with (mostly) consistent addresses between models, and no write-only registers (except for the hardware multiplier).

===General purpose I/O ports 0–10===
If the peripheral is not needed, the pin may be used for general purpose I/O. The pins are divided into 8-bit groups called &quot;ports&quot;, each of which is controlled by a number of 8-bit registers. In some cases, the ports are arranged in pairs which can be accessed as 16-bit registers.

The MSP430 family defines 11 I/O ports, P0 through P10, although no chip implements more than 10 of them. P0 is only implemented on the &#x27;3xx family. P7 through P10 are only implemented on the largest members (and highest pin count versions) of the &#x27;4xx and &#x27;2xx families. The newest &#x27;5xx and &#x27;6xx families has P1 through P11, and the control registers are reassigned to provide more port pairs.
Each port is controlled by the following registers. Ports which do not implement particular features (such as interrupt on state change) do not implement the corresponding registers.
; P&quot;x&quot;IN : Port &quot;x&quot; input. This is a read-only register, and reflects the current state of the port&#x27;s pins.
; P&quot;x&quot;OUT : Port &quot;x&quot; output. The values written to this read/write register are driven out the corresponding pins when they are configured to output.
; P&quot;x&quot;DIR : Port &quot;x&quot; data direction. Bits written as 1 configure the corresponding pin for output. Bits written as 0 configure the pin for input.
; P&quot;x&quot;SEL : Port &quot;x&quot; function select. Bits written as 1 configure the corresponding pin for use by the specialized peripheral. Bits written as 0 configure the pin for general purpose I/O. Port 0 (&#x27;3xx parts only) is not multiplexed with other peripherals and does not have a P0SEL register.
; P&quot;x&quot;REN : Port &quot;x&quot; resistor enable (&#x27;2xx &amp; &#x27;5xx only). Bits set in this register enable weak pull-up or pull-down resistors on the corresponding I/O pins even when they are configured as inputs. The direction of the pull is set by the bit written to the P&quot;x&quot;OUT register.
; P&quot;x&quot;DS : Port &quot;x&quot; drive strength (&#x27;5xx only). Bits set in this register enable high current outputs. This increases output power, but may cause electromagnetic interference (EMI).
Ports 0–2 can produce interrupts when inputs change. Further registers configure this ability:
; P&quot;x&quot;IES : Port &quot;x&quot; interrupt edge select. Selects the edge which will cause the P&quot;x&quot;IFG bit to be set. When the input bit changes from matching the P&quot;x&quot;IES state to not matching it (i.e. whenever a bit in P&quot;x&quot;IES XOR P&quot;x&quot;IN changes from clear to set), the corresponding P&quot;x&quot;IFG bit is set.
; P&quot;x&quot;IE : Port &quot;x&quot; interrupt enable. When this bit and the corresponding P&quot;x&quot;IFG bit are both set, an interrupt is generated.
; P&quot;x&quot;IFG : Port &quot;x&quot; interrupt flag. Set whenever the corresponding pin makes the state change requested by P&quot;x&quot;IES. Can be cleared only by software. (Can also be set by software.)
; P&quot;x&quot;IV : Port &quot;x&quot; interrupt vector (&#x27;5xx only). This 16-bit register is a priority encoder which can be used to handle pin-change interrupts. If &quot;n&quot; is the lowest-numbered interrupt bit which is pending in P&quot;x&quot;IFG and enabled in P&quot;x&quot;IE, this register reads as 2&quot;n&quot;+2. If there is no such bit, it reads as 0. The scale factor of 2 allows direct use as an offset into a branch table. Reading this register also clears the reported P&quot;x&quot;IFG flag.
Some pins have special purposes either as inputs or outputs. (For example, timer pins can be configured as capture inputs or PWM outputs.) In this case, the P&quot;x&quot;DIR bit controls which of the two functions the pin performs when the P&quot;x&quot;SEL bit is set. If there is only one special function, then P&quot;x&quot;DIR is generally ignored.
The P&quot;x&quot;IN register is still readable if the P&quot;x&quot;SEL bit is set, but interrupt generation is disabled. If P&quot;x&quot;SEL is clear, the special function&#x27;s input is frozen and disconnected from the external pin. Also, configuring a pin for general purpose output does &quot;not&quot; disable interrupt generation.
===Integrated peripherals===
;Analog
:*;Analog-to-digital converter
::The MSP430 line offers two types of analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). 10- and 12-bit successive approximation converters, as well as a 16-bit sigma-delta converter. Data transfer controllers and a 16-word conversion-and-control buffer allow the MSP430 to convert and store samples without CPU intervention, minimizing power consumption.

:*;Analog pool
::The Analog Pool (A-POOL) module can be configured as an ADC, DAC, comparator, SVS or temperature sensor. It allows flexibility for the user to program a series of analog functions with only one setup.

:*;Comparator A, A+
::The MSP430&#x27;s comparator module provides precision slope analog-to-digital conversions. Monitors external analog signals and provides voltage and resistor value measurement. Capable of selectable power modes.

:*;DAC12
::The DAC12 module is a 12-bit, voltage-output DAC featuring internal/external reference selection and programmable settling time for optimal power consumption. It can be configured in 8- or 12-bit mode. When multiple DAC12 modules are present, they may be grouped together for synchronous update operation.

:*;Op Amps
::Feature single supply, low current operation with rail-to-rail outputs and programmable settling times. Software selectable configuration options: unity gain mode, comparator mode, inverting PGA, non-inverting PGA, differential and instrumentation amplifier.

:*;Sigma Delta (SD)
::The SD16/SD16_A/SD24_A modules each feature 16-/24-bit sigma-delta A/D converters with an internal 1.2-V reference. Each converter has up to eight fully differential multiplexed inputs, including a built-in temperature sensor. The converters are second-order oversampling sigma-delta modulators with selectable oversampling ratios of up to 1024 (SD16_A/SD24_A) or 256 (SD16).

;Timers

:*;Basic timer (BT)
::The BT has two independent 8-bit timers that can be cascaded to form a 16-bit timer/counter. Both timers can be read and written by software. The BT is extended to provide an integrated RTC. An internal calendar compensates for months with less than 31 days and includes leap-year correction.

:*;Real-Time Clock
::RTC_A/B are 32-bit hardware counter modules that provide clock counters with a calendar, a flexible programmable alarm, and calibration. The RTC_B includes a switchable battery backup system that provides the ability for the RTC to operate when the primary supply fails.

:*;16-bit timers
::Timer_A, Timer_B and Timer_D are asynchronous 16-bit timers/counters with up to seven capture/compare registers and various operating modes. The timers support multiple capture/compares, PWM outputs, and interval timing. They also have extensive interrupt capabilities. Timer_B introduces added features such as programmable timer lengths (8-, 10-, 12-, or 16-bit) and double-buffered compare register updates, while Timer_D introduces a high-resolution (4 ns) mode.

:*;Watchdog (WDT+)
::The WDT+ performs a controlled system restart after a software problem occurs. If the selected time interval expires, a system reset is generated. If the watchdog function is not needed in an application, the module can be configured as an interval timer and can generate interrupts at selected time intervals.

;System

:*;Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
::The AES accelerator module performs encryption and decryption of 128-bit data with 128-bit keys according to the advanced encryption standard in hardware, and can be configured with user software.

:*;Brown-Out Reset (BOR)
::The BOR circuit detects low supply voltages and resets the device by triggering a power-on reset (POR) signal when power is applied or removed. The MSP430 MCU’s zero-power BOR circuit is continuously turned on, including in all low-power modes.

:*;Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller
::The DMA controller transfers data from one address to another across the entire address range without CPU intervention. The DMA increases the throughput of peripheral modules and reduces system power consumption. The module features up to three independent transfer channels.

::Although the MSP430&#x27;s DMA subsystem is very capable it has several flaws, the most significant of which is the lack of an external transfer strobe. Although a DMA transfer can be triggered externally, there is no external indication of completion of a transfer. Consequently DMA to and from external sources is limited to external trigger per byte transfers, rather than full blocks automatically via DMA. This can lead to significant complexity (as in requiring extensive hand tweaking of code) when implementing processor to processor or processor to USB communications. The reference cited uses an obscure timer mode to generate high speed strobes for DMA transfers. The timers are not flexible enough to easily make up for the lack of an external DMA transfer strobe.

::DMA operations that involve word transfers to byte locations cause truncation to 8 bits rather than conversion to two byte transfers. This makes DMA with A/D or D/A 16 bit values less useful than it could be (although it is possible to DMA these values through port A or B on some versions of the MSP 430 using an externally visible trigger per transfer such as a timer output).

:*;Enhanced Emulation Module (EEM)
::The EEM provides different levels of debug features such as 2-8 hardware breakpoints, complex breakpoints, break when read/write occurs at specified address, and more. Embedded into all flash-based MSP430 devices.

:*;Hardware multiplier
::Some MSP430 models include a memory-mapped hardware multiplier peripheral which performs various 16×16+32→33-bit multiply-accumulate operations. Unusually for the MSP430, this peripheral does include an implicit 2-bit write-only register, which makes it effectively impossible to context switch. This peripheral does not interfere with CPU activities and can be accessed by the DMA. The MPY on all MSP430F5xx and some MSP430F4xx devices feature up to 32-bit x 32-bit.

::The 8 registers used are:

::The first operand is written to one of four 16-bit registers. The address written determines the operation performed. While the value written can be read back from any of the registers, the register number written to cannot be recovered.

::If a multiply-accumulate operation is desired, the codice_1 and codice_2 registers must also be initialized.

::Then, each time a write is performed to the codice_3 register, a multiply is performed and the result stored or added to the result registers. The codice_4 register is a read-only register that contains the carry out of the addition (0 or 1) in case of an unsigned multiply), or the sign extension of the 32-bit sum (0 or -1) in case of a signed multiply. In the case of a signed multiply-accumulate, the codice_4 value must be combined with the most significant bit of the prior codice_6 contents to determine the true carry out result (-1, 0, or +1).

::The result is available after three clock cycles of delay, which is the time required to fetch a following instruction and a following index word. Thus, the delay is typically invisible. An explicit delay is only required if using an indirect addressing mode to fetch the result.

:*;Memory Protection Unit (MPU)
::The FRAM MPU protects against accidental writes to designated read-only memory segments or execution of code from a constant memory. The MPU can set any portioning of memory with bit level addressing, making the complete memory accessible for read, write and execute operations in FRAM devices.

:*;Power management module (PMM)
::The PMM generates a supply voltage for the core logic, and provides several mechanisms for the supervision and monitoring of both the voltage applied to the device and the voltage generated for the core. It is integrated with a low-dropout voltage regulator (LDO), brown-out reset (BOR), and a supply voltage supervisor and monitor.

:*;Supply-Voltage Supervisor (SVS)
::The SVS is a configurable module used to monitor the AVCC supply voltage or an external voltage. The SVS can be configured to set a flag or generate a power-on reset (POR) when the supply voltage or external voltage drops below a user-selected threshold.

;Communication and Interface

:*;Capacitive Touch Sense I/Os
::The integrated capacitive touch sense I/O module offers several benefits to touch button and touch slider applications. The system does not require external components to create the self-oscillation (reducing bill of materials) and the capacitor (that defines the frequency of the self-oscillation) can be connected directly. In addition, there is no need for external MUXes to allow multiple pads and each I/O pad can directly serve as a cap sense input. A hysteresis of ~0.7 V ensures robust operation. Control and sequencing is done completely in software.

:*;General Purpose I/Os
::MSP430 devices have up to 12 digital I/O ports implemented. Each port has eight I/O pins. Every I/O pin can be configured as either input or output, and can be individually read or written to. Ports P1 and P2 have interrupt capability. MSP430F2xx, F5xx and some F4xx devices feature built-in, individually configurable pull-up or pull-down resistors.

:*;Sub-GHz RF Front End
::The flexible CC1101 sub-1 GHz transceiver delivers the sensitivity and blocking performance required to achieve successful communication links in any RF environment. It also features low current consumption and supports flexible data rates and modulation formats.

:*;USART (UART, SPI, I²C)
::The universal synchronous/asynchronous receive/transmit (USART) peripheral interface supports asynchronous RS-232 and synchronous SPI communication with one hardware module. The MSP430F15x/16x USART modules also support I²C, programmable baud rate, and independent interrupt capability for receive and transmit.

:*;USB
::The USB module is fully compliant with the USB 2.0 specification and supports control, interrupt and bulk transfers at a data rate of 12 Mbps (full speed). The module supports USB suspend, resume and remote wake-up operations and can be configured for up to eight input and eight output endpoints. The module includes an integrated physical interface (PHY); a phase-locked loop (PLL) for USB clock generation; and a flexible power-supply system enabling bus-powered and self-powered devices.

:*;USCI (UART, SPI, I²C, LIN, IrDA)
::The universal serial communication interface (USCI) module features two independent channels that can be used simultaneously. The asynchronous channel (USCI_A) supports UART mode; SPI mode; pulse shaping for IrDA; and automatic baud-rate detection for LIN communications. The synchronous channel (USCI_B) supports I²C and SPI modes.

:*;USI (SPI, I²C)
::The universal serial interface (USI) module is a synchronous serial communication interface with a data length of up to 16-bits and can support SPI and I²C communication with minimal software.

:*;Infrared Modulation
::Available on the MSP430FR4xxx and MSP430FR2xxx series chips, this feature is configured via the SYSCFG register set. This peripheral ties into other peripherals (Timers, eUSCI_A) to generate an IR modulated signal on an output pin.

;Metering

:*;ESP430 (integrated in FE42xx devices)
::The ESP430CE module performs metering calculations independent of the CPU. Module has separate SD16, HW multiplier, and the ESP430 embedded processor engine for single-phase energy-metering applications.

:*;Scan Interface (SIF)
::The SIF module, a programmable state machine with an analog front end, is used to automatically measure linear or rotational motion with the lowest possible power consumption. The module features support for different types of LC and resistive sensors and for quadrature encoding.

;Display

:*;LCD/LCD_A/LCD_B
::The LCD/LCD_A controller directly drives LCDs for up to 196 segments. Supports static, 2-mux, 3-mux, and 4-mux LCDs. LCD_A module has integrated charge pump for contrast control. LCD_B enables blinking of individual segments with separate blinking memory.

:*;LCD_E
::The LCD_E controller comes with the newer MSP430FR4xxx series microcontrollers and directly drives LCDs up to 448 segments. Supports static, 2-mux, 3-mux, 4-mux, 5-mux, 6-mux, 7-mux, 8-mux (1/3 bias) LCDs. Segment and Common pins may be reprogrammed to available LCD drive pins. This peripheral may be driven in LPM3.5 (RTC running+Main CPU core shutdown low-power mode).

==Software development environment==
Texas Instruments provides various hardware experimenter boards that support large (approximately two centimeters square) and small (approximately one millimeter square) MSP430 chips. TI also provides software development tools, both directly, and in conjunction with partners (see the full list of compilers, assemblers, and IDEs). One such toolchain is the IAR C/C++ compiler and &quot;Integrated development environment&quot;, or IDE. A Kickstart edition can be downloaded for free from TI or IAR; it is limited to 8 KB of C/C++ code in the compiler and debugger (assembly language programs of any size can be developed and debugged with this free toolchain).

TI also combines a version of its own compiler and tools with its Eclipse-based Code Composer Studio IDE (CCS). It sells full-featured versions, and offers a free version for download which has a code size limit of 16 KB. CCS supports in-circuit emulators, and includes a simulator and other tools; it can also work with other processors sold by TI.

For those who are more comfortable with the Arduino, there is also another software Energia, an open source electronics prototyping platform with the goal to bring the Wiring and Arduino framework to the Texas Instruments MSP430 based LaunchPad where Arduino code can be exported for programming MSP430 chips. The latest release of Energia supports the MSP-EXP430G2xxx, MSP-EXP430FR5739, MSP-EXP430FR5969, MSP-EXP430FR5994, MSP-EXP430F5529LP, Stellaris EK-LM4F120XL, Tiva-C EK-TM4C123GXL, Tiva-C EK-TM4C1294XL, CC3200 Wi-Fi LaunchPad.

The open source community produces a freely available software development toolset based on the GNU toolset.
The GNU compiler is currently declined in three versions:

(MSPGCC)

(MSPGCC Uniarch)

TI consulted with RedHat to provide official support for the MSP430 architecture to the GNU Compiler Collection C/C++ compiler. This msp430-elf-gcc compiler is supported by TI&#x27;s Code Composer Studio version 6.0 and higher.

There is a very early llvm-msp430 project, which may eventually provide better support for MSP430 in LLVM.

Other commercial development tool sets, which include editor, compiler, linker, assembler, debugger and in some cases code wizards, are available. VisSim, a block diagram language for model based development, generates efficient fixed point C-Code directly from the diagram. VisSim generated code for a closed loop ADC+PWM based PID control on the F2013 compiles to less than 1 KB flash and 100 bytes RAM. VisSim has on-chip peripheral blocks for the entire MSP430 family I²C, ADC, SD16, PWM.

==Low cost development platforms==
The MSP430F2013 and its siblings are set apart by the fact that (except for the MSP430G2 Value Line) it is the only MSP430 part that is available in a dual in-line package (DIP). Other variants in this family are only available in various surface-mount packages. TI has gone to some trouble to support the eZ430 development platform by making the raw chips easy for hobbyists to use in prototypes.

===eZ430-F2013===
TI has tackled the low-budget problem by offering a very small experimenter board, the &quot;eZ430-F2013&quot;, on a USB stick (now obsolete). This made it easy for designers to choose the MSP430 chip for inexpensive development platforms that can be used with a computer. The eZ430-F2013 contains an MSP430F2013 microcontroller on a detachable prototyping board, and accompanying CD with development software. It is helpful for schools, hobbyists and garage inventors. It is also welcomed by engineers in large companies prototyping projects with capital budget problems.

===MSP430 LaunchPad===
Texas Instruments released the MSP430 LaunchPad in July 2010 at a cost of $4.30. The MSP430 LaunchPad has an onboard flash emulator, USB, 2 programmable LEDs, and 1 programmable push button. As an addition to experimentation with the LaunchPad a shield board is available.

TI has since provided several new LaunchPads based on the MSP430 platform:

==Debugging interface==
In common with other microcontroller vendors, TI has developed a two-wire debugging interface found on some of their MSP430 parts that can replace the larger JTAG interface. The eZ430 Development Tool contains a full USB-connected flash emulation tool (FET) for this new two-wire protocol, named &quot;Spy-Bi-Wire&quot; by TI. Spy-Bi-Wire was initially introduced on only the smallest devices in the &#x27;F2xx family with limited number of I/O pins, such as the MSP430F20xx, MSP430F21x2, and MSP430F22x2. The support for Spy-Bi-Wire has been expanded with the introduction of the latest &#x27;5xx family, where all devices have support Spy-Bi-Wire interface in addition to JTAG.

The advantage of the Spy-Bi-Wire protocol is that it uses only two communication lines, one of which is the dedicated _RESET line. The JTAG interface on the lower pin count MSP430 parts is multiplexed with general purpose I/O lines. This makes it relatively difficult to debug circuits built around the small, low-I/O-budget chips, since the full 4-pin JTAG hardware will conflict with anything else connected to those I/O lines. This problem is alleviated with the Spy-Bi-Wire-capable chips, which are still compatible with the normal JTAG interface for backwards compatibility with the old development tools.

JTAG debugging and flash programming tools based on OpenOCD and widely used in the ARM architecture community are not available for the MSP430. Programming tools specially designed for the MSP430 are marginally less expensive than JTAG interfaces that use OpenOCD. However, should it be discovered mid-project that more MIPS, more memory, and more I/O peripherals are needed, those tools will not transfer to a processor from another vendor.

==MSP430 CPU==
The MSP430 CPU uses a von Neumann architecture, with a single address space for instructions and data. Memory is byte-addressed, and pairs of bytes are combined little-endian to make 16-bit words.

The processor contains 16 16-bit registers, of which four are dedicated to special purposes: R0 is the program counter, R1 is the stack pointer, R2 is the status register, and R3 is a &quot;constant generator&quot; which reads as zero and ignores writes. Added address mode encodings using R3 and R2 allow a total of six commonly used constant values (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and −1) without needing an immediate operand word. R4 through R15 are available for general use.

The instruction set is very simple: 27 instructions exist in three families. Most instructions occur in .B (8-bit byte) and .W (16-bit word) suffixed versions, depending on the value of a B/W bit: the bit is set to 1 for 8-bit and 0 for 16-bit. A missing suffix is equivalent to .W. Byte operations to memory affect only the addressed byte, while byte operations to registers clear the most significant byte.

Instructions are 16 bits, followed by up to two 16-bit extension words. Addressing modes are specified by the 2-bit As field and the 1-bit Ad field. Some special versions can be constructed using R0, and modes other than register direct using R2 (the status register) and R3 (the constant generator) are interpreted specially. Ad can use only a subset of the addressing modes for As.

Indexed addressing modes add a 16-bit extension word to the instruction. If both source and destination are indexed, the source extension word comes first. &quot;x&quot; refers to the next extension word in the instruction stream in the table below.

Instructions generally take 1 cycle per word fetched or stored, so instruction times range from 1 cycle for a simple register-register instruction to 6 cycles for an instruction with both source and destination indexed.

The MSP430X extension with 20-bit addressing adds added instructions that can require up to 10 clock cycles. Setting or clearing a peripheral bit takes two clocks. A jump, taken or not takes two clocks. With the 2xx series 2 MCLKs is 125 ns at 16 MHz.

Moves to the program counter are allowed and perform jumps. Return from subroutine, for example, is implemented as MOV @SP+,PC.

When R0 (PC) or R1 (SP) are used with the autoincrement addressing mode, they are always incremented by two. Other registers (R4 through R15) are incremented by the operand size, either 1 or 2 bytes.

The status register contains 4 arithmetic status bits, a global interrupt enable, and 4 bits that disable various clocks to enter low-power mode. When handling an interrupt, the processor saves the status register on the stack and clears the low-power bits. If the interrupt handler does not modify the saved status register, returning from the interrupt will then resume the original low-power mode.

===Pseudo-operations===
Many added instructions are implemented as aliases for forms of the above. For example, there is no specific &quot;return from subroutine&quot; instruction, but it is implemented as &quot;MOV @SP+,PC&quot;. Emulated instructions are:
Note that the immediate constants −1 (0xffff), 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 can be specified in a single-word instruction without needing a separate immediate operand.

===MSP430X 20-bit extension===
The basic MSP430 cannot support more memory (ROM + RAM + peripherals) than its 64K address space. In order to support this, an extended form of the MSP430 uses 20-bit registers and a 20-bit address space, allowing up to 1 MB of memory. This uses the same instruction set as the basic form, but with two extensions:
# A limited number of 20-bit instructions for common operations, and
# A general prefix-word mechanism that can extend any instruction to 20 bits.
The extended instructions include some added abilities, notably multibit shifts and multiregister load/store operations.

20-bit operations use the length suffix &quot;A&quot; (for address) instead of .B or .W. .W is still the default. In general, shorter operations clear the high-order bits of the destination register.

The new instructions are as follows:
All other instructions can have a prefix word added which extends them to 20 bits. The prefix word contains an added operand size bit, which is combined with the existing B/W bit to specify the operand size. One unused size combination exists; indications suggest that it may be used in future for a 32-bit operand size.

The prefix word comes in two formats, and the choice between them depends on the instruction which follows.
If the instruction has any non-register operands, then the simple form is used, which provides 2 4-bit fields to extend any offset or immediate constant in the instruction stream to 20 bits.

If the instruction is register-to-register, a different extension word is used. This includes a &quot;ZC&quot; flag which suppresses carry-in (useful for instructions like DADD which always use the carry bit), and a repeat count. A 4-bit field in the extension word encodes either a repeat count (0–15 repetitions in addition to the initial execution), or a register number which contains a 4-bit repeat count.

==MSP430 address space==
The general layout of the MSP430 address space is:

; 0x0000–0x0007 : Processor special function registers (interrupt control registers)
; 0x0008–0x00FF : 8-bit peripherals. These must be accessed using 8-bit loads and stores.
; 0x0100–0x01FF : 16-bit peripherals. These must be accessed using 16-bit loads and stores.
; 0x0200–0x09FF : Up to 2048 bytes of RAM.
; 0x0C00–0x0FFF : 1024 bytes of bootstrap loader ROM (flash parts only).
; 0x1000–0x10FF : 256 bytes of data flash ROM (flash parts only).
; 0x1800-0x19FF : 512 bytes of data FRAM (most FRAM MCUs, user-writable containing no calibration data)
; 0x1100–0x38FF : Extended RAM on models with more than 2048 bytes of RAM. (0x1100–0x18FF is a copy of 0x0200–0x09FF)
; 0x1100–0xFFFF : Up to 60 kilobytes of program ROM. Smaller ROMs start at higher addresses. The last 16 or 32 bytes are interrupt vectors.

A few models include more than 2048 bytes of RAM; in that case RAM begins at 0x1100. The first 2048 bytes (0x1100–0x18FF) is mirrored at 0x0200–0x09FF for compatibility. Also, some recent models bend the 8-bit and 16-bit peripheral rules, allowing 16-bit access to peripherals in the 8-bit peripheral address range.

There is a new extended version of the architecture (named MSP430X) which allows a 20-bit address space. It allows added program ROM beginning at 0x10000.

The &#x27;5xx series has a greatly redesigned address space, with the first 4K devoted to peripherals, and up to 16K of RAM.

<text>A systematic name is a name given in a systematic way to one unique group, organism, object or chemical substance, out of a specific population or collection. Systematic names are usually part of a nomenclature.

A semisystematic name or semitrivial name is a name that has at least one systematic part and at least one trivial part, such as a chemical vernacular name.

Creating systematic names can be as simple as assigning a prefix or a number to each object (in which case they are a type of numbering scheme), or as complex as encoding the complete structure of the object in the name. Many systems combine some information about the named object with an extra sequence number to make it into a unique identifier.

Systematic names often co-exist with earlier common names assigned before the creation of any systematic naming system. For example, many common chemicals are still referred to by their common or trivial names, even by chemists.

==In chemistry==
In chemistry, a systematic name describes the chemical structure of a chemical substance, thus giving some information about its chemical properties.

The &quot;Compendium of Chemical Terminology&quot; published by the IUPAC defines systematic name as &quot;a name composed wholly of specially coined or selected syllables, with or without numerical prefixes; e.g. pentane, oxazole.&quot; However, when trivial names have become part of chemical nomenclature, they can be the systematic name of a substance or part of it. Examples for some systematic names that have trivial origins are benzene (cyclohexatriene) or glycerol (trihydroxypropane).

==Examples==
There are standardized systematic or semi-systematic names for:
* Chemical elements (following IUPAC guidelines)
* Chemical nomenclature (following IUPAC guidelines)
* Binomial nomenclature, initiated by Carl Linnaeus
* Astronomical objects and entities (administered by the International Astronomical Union)
* Genes (following HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee procedures)
* Proteins
* Minerals (administered by the IMA)
* Monoclonal antibodies

<doc id="218396" wikidata="Q507233" url="?curid=218396" title="Charles Lynch (judge)">
<text>Charles Lynch (1736 – 1796) was an American planter, politician, military officer and judge who headed a kangaroo court in Virginia to punish Loyalists during the Revolutionary War. The terms &quot;lynching&quot; and &quot;lynch law&quot; are believed to be derived from his surname.

==Early life==
He was born in 1736 at an estate known as Chestnut Hill on the banks of the James River in Virginia, a place at which his brother, John Lynch, would later establish the town of Lynchburg. Lynch&#x27;s father left his native Ireland and emigrated to the British colony of Virginia in about 1725 as an indentured servant, called a &quot;redemptioner&quot; in the nomenclature of the day. Upon arrival to the New World, Lynch&#x27;s contract of indenture was sold to a wealthy planter living in Caroline County. Lynch remained with the planter for his fixed term of servitude, winning in the process not only his freedom but also the hand of the planter&#x27;s daughter, Sarah Clark, in marriage. 

With the financial assistance of the elder Clark, the Lynches themselves became planters of tobacco on a large scale, farming well over 7,000 acres of Virginia land. Sometime between Charles&#x27;s birth in 1736 and the middle of the decade, Charles&#x27;s father died, leaving behind his Chestnut Hill estate to his eldest son, John. His mother joined the Quaker religious sect in 1750, bringing her sons with her into that religion. The family initially joined the Cedar Creek Meeting in Bedford County, Virginia, and later helped found the South River Friends Meetinghouse in Lynchburg, Virginia. Lynch married a fellow Quaker, the former Anne Terrell, on January 12, 1755. With Chestnut Hill occupied by his brother, the young couple set out to establish their new home on Virginia&#x27;s western frontier on a more distant parcel of land granted to his father by King George II, in the newly established Bedford County. 

Green Level, the Lynch estate where the couple would ultimately raise five children, was located at a place now marked by the town of Altavista. Lynch was instrumental in organizing a Quaker meeting in Bedford County and raising funds for a building to house it, the first public house of worship in the area. Lynch served for several years as the clerk of the meeting and as trustee of the group&#x27;s meeting house. He was also a delegate to the Quaker Assembly in Virginia. Following the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, the danger associated with life at the frontier greatly lessened, and a flood of newcomers began to appear in Bedford County. 

His position as a landowner and leading citizen was now well-established. His farming of tobacco and raising of cattle had made him a wealthy man, the possessor of property which included several slaves. Beginning in 1764 other citizens began to approach Lynch to ask him to become a candidate for the Virginia Assembly. Lynch initially refused the entreaties on the grounds that swearing the necessary oath of office was prohibited behavior for an adherent of the Quaker religion.

==Career==

In 1767, Charles became a justice of the peace of Bedford County, Virginia but was disowned by the Quakers for taking an oath of office, something they were not permitted to do. Lynch served in the Virginia House of Burgesses and the Convention from 1769 until 1778, when he became a militia colonel. In several incidents in 1780, Lynch and several other militia officers and justices of the peace rounded up suspects who were thought to be a part of a Loyalist uprising in southwestern Virginia. The suspects were given a summary trial at an informal court; sentences handed down included whipping, property seizure, coerced pledges of allegiance, and conscription into the military. Lynch&#x27;s extralegal actions were legitimized by the Virginia General Assembly in 1782. After the Revolution, he served in the Virginia Senate from 1784 to 1789.

He defined &quot;Lynch&#x27;s Law&quot;, as private vengeance or summary and illegal punishment for crimes actual or pretended, with his &quot;Lynching&quot; being applied both on account of race and opposition to the Revolution. Variations of the term, such as &quot;lynch law&quot;, &quot;judge lynch&quot;, and &quot;lynching&quot;, were standard entries in American and British English dictionaries by the 1850s. In 1811, a man named Captain William Lynch claimed that the phrase, already famous, actually came from a 1780 compact signed by him and his neighbors in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, to uphold their own brand of law independent of legal authority. The obscurity of the Pittsylvania County compact compared to the well-known actions of Charles Lynch casts doubt on it being the source of the phrase.

== Later life and death ==
Lynch, like many other planters of his day, had a significant amount of his money tied up in real estate, and was cash poor. He lived in relative poverty at his home, Avoca. He died and was buried there in 1796.

<text>Abram Marshall Scott (March 13, 1785June 12, 1833) was a politician in Mississippi. He was born in Edgefield County in the Province of South Carolina. He was an early settler of Wilkinson County, Mississippi and was instrumental in founding the town of Woodville, Mississippi. He held local political offices before his election to the Mississippi State Senate. As President of the Mississippi Senate he also served as Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi. He belonged to the National Republican Party.

== Early life ==
Abram Marshall Scott was born in 1785 in Edgefield County, South Carolina. He migrated to Wilkinson County, Mississippi early in his life, where he would serve as a tax collector. During the War of 1812, Scott served as a lieutenant in the 1st Mississippi Regiment of Volunteers.

== Political career ==
Scott served as a delegate during Mississippi&#x27;s Constitutional Convention of 1817, before serving in the state senate in 1822 and 1826–1827. In 1828, Scott was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi, and in 1832, he was sworn in as the seventh Governor of Mississippi, having defeated Hiram Runnels in the general election of August 1831.

During Scott&#x27;s administration, the State of South Carolina attempted to nullify a tariff passed by the United States Congress, leading to the Nullification Crisis, in which South Carolina&#x27;s government threatened to secede from the United States. Like other southern states, Mississippi did not support South Carolina&#x27;s actions, defusing the crisis.

In 1832, Mississippi ratified a new constitution, which led to a special election for public officials under the new constitution in May 1833. Scott was defeated by Hiram Runnels in this election, but due to disputes over the legality of the special election, Scott was permitted to remain in office. He served until he died on June 12, 1833, due to a cholera epidemic in Jackson, and was succeeded by Charles Lynch.

He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi. Scott County, Mississippi is named in his honor.

<text>Transformative justice is a spectrum of social, economic, legal, and political practices and philosophies that aim to focus on the structures and underlying conditions that perpetuate harm and injustice. Taking up and expanding on the goals of restorative justice such as individual/community accountability, reparation, and non-retributive responses to harm, transformative justice imagines and puts into practice alternatives to the formal, state-based criminal justice system.

== Overview of Transformative Justice ==
As defined by American activist Mariame Kaba, transformative justice is a framework that focuses on community-building and collective solidarity against the repressive mechanisms of the carceral state. First popularized by Queer, Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and other marginalized communities due to their perception that they were unable to rely on the police and the courts to obtain justice after being victimized by interpersonal harm (such as hate crimes, sexual assaults, and domestic violence), it prioritizes the relationships between the individual, the communities to which they are accountable, and the broader systems and surrounding environment in which we are implicated. Contemporary transformative justice theorizing traces its lineage to other anti-carceral and abolitionist social movements as led by Black, Indigenous, and other racialized communities who are often directly harmed by the carceral state. 

Transformative justice aims to resist and divest from traditional methods of state-sanctioned punishment such as police, prisons, the judiciary, and juvenile delinquency programs. Premised on the recognition that these institutions frequently inflict compounding harm on individuals through surveillance and social control, transformative justice advocates look to move away from the ways in which the criminal justice system perpetuates harm both within prisons and communities on the outside. 

Transformative justice also rests on the belief that interpersonal harm interacts with and reflects systemic and institutional mechanisms of oppression. For instance, sexual assault mirrors the patriarchal conception of women as devoid of personal agency. Therefore, transformative justice recognizes that addressing individual interpersonal harm and conflict must simultaneously aim to dismantle systemic structures of power (such as patriarchy, cisheteronormativity, racism, ableism, and colonialism). To this end, transformative justice applies a systems approach, seeking to see problems as not only evidence of crime but also as a catalyst for crime. With respect to those impacted, it aims to recognize instances of harm as an opportunity for a transformative, relational, and educational intervention for victims, offenders, and the broader community. In this light, applications of transformative justice practices can meaningfully apply even between people who have had no prior contact. 

Transformative justice takes the principles and practices of restorative justice beyond the criminal justice system. It applies to areas such as environmental law, corporate law, labor-management relations, consumer bankruptcy and debt, and family law. Transformative justice uses a systems approach, seeking to see problems, as not only the beginning of the crime but also the causes of crime, and tries to treat an offense as a transformative relational and educational opportunity for victims, offenders and all other members of the affected community. In theory, a transformative justice model can apply even between peoples with no prior contact.

Writer and transformative justice practitioner adrienne maree brown contends that transformative justice cannot occur if the reaction to each committed transgression is one of a public takedown (reminiscent of cancel culture). brown calls out the hypocrisy of thinkers in the transformative justice movement who reproduce the very forms of retribution and violence in their disagreements that transformative justice seeks to subvert. Additionally, brown offers practical considerations to reflect on in situations of conflict in the goal of a collective pivot to transformative justice: 

* deliberate listening with the goal of understanding the contexts that enabled a specific harm;
* learning from each conflict to help facilitate introspection;
* considering alternatives to public confrontation in response to conflict, such as personal exchange to breed trust, resilience and interdependence.

Transformative justice can be seen as a general philosophical strategy for responding to conflicts akin to peacemaking. Transformative justice is concerned with root causes and comprehensive outcomes. It is akin to healing justice more than other alternatives to imprisonment. In this, transformative justice takes the principles and practices of restorative justice beyond the criminal justice system and applies to areas such as environmental law, corporate law, labor-management relations, consumer bankruptcy and debt, and family law.

As in transformative learning, one works from desired future states back to the present steps required to reach them. The issue is not whether the perpetrator may make a choice to do something similar again, but whether the community is willing to support the victim and perpetrator in some form of contact. It is possible for the community to choose to support the perpetrator and not the victim as defined by the law, but if they do so they may be obligated to support some re-definition of &quot;equity&quot; so that law comes back into line with the social concept of equity. For example, it is possible for the community to support imprisonment as a means of isolation but not punishment.

This model for decarceration may have roots in the work of Samuel Tuke and B. F. Skinner but departs by relying on individual volunteers&#x27; caring and supporting capacity, not any socially imposed etiquette derived from civilization. Transformative justice theory has been advanced by Ruth Morris and Giselle Dias of the Canadian Quakers.

Anarchist criminology tends to favour holistic transformative justice approaches over restorative justice, which it tends to argue is too beholden to the existing criminal justice system.

== Distinctions between transformative and restorative justice ==
Transformative justice is distinguishable from restorative justice in that transformative justice places emphasis on addressing and repairing harm outside of the state. adrienne maree brown uses the example of a person who has stolen money in order to buy food to sustain themselves, writing that “if the racialized system of capitalism has produced such inequality that someone who is hungry and steals a purse to resource a meal, returning the purse with an apology or community service to does nothing to address that hunger”. Instead, transformative justice requires “the work of addressing harm at the root, outside the mechanisms of the state, so that we can grow into the right relationship with one another”.

Transformative justice is further distinct from restorative justice in that, as many activists and movements stress, the latter is more easily vulnerable to state co-optation. While many of the goals of restorative justice intersect or are compatible with the goals of transformative justice, many restorative justice practices tend to operate within the confines of existing state structures, such as within jails or through community programs involving law enforcement. For example, many restorative justice initiatives take place directly within jails and involve a collaborative relationship with law enforcement or with state sponsored justice systems. As Mimi Kim writes:

A stark divide between restorative justice and transformative justice rests on the question of whether or not to engage with the criminal justice system in navigating responses to instances of harms or violence. It is the reliance on or collaboration with formalized or state systems of justice that distinguishes restorative justice approaches from transformative justice ones. Thus, while restorative justice and transformative justice may share similar ideological underpinnings and goals, their set of approaches and tactics can be quite divergent. 

In contrast to restorative justice, no quantification or assessment of loss or harms or any assignment of the role of victim is made, and no attempt to compare the past (historical) and future (normative or predicted) conditions is made either. While restorative justice seeks to return the victim to their initial state before the harm occurred, transformative justice is more concerned with questioning whether the conditions in place before the harm are themselves equitable and just, and looks to redress them in order to prevent further harm within the community. The victim is not normally part of the transformative process, but can choose to be. Participants agree only on what constitutes effective harms reduction, which may include separating or isolating perpetrator and victim. 

In contrast to equity-restorative justice, there is no social definition of equity imposed on participants. Each is free to decide on some &quot;new normal&quot; state of being for themselves, and is not pressured to agree on it. A victim may continue to seek revenge or desire punishment, e.g. as in retributive justice systems. A perpetrator may lack remorse and may say that they lack remorse.

== Applications of transformative justice ==

=== In post-colonial and post-conflict settings ===
Transformative justice also refers to policy and practice responses to socioeconomic issues in societies transitioning away from conflict or repression. It is closely associated with the scholarship and practice of transitional justice, and refers to &quot;transformative change that emphasises local agency and resources, the prioritisation of process rather than preconceived outcomes, and the challenging of unequal and intersecting power relationships and structures of exclusion at both local and global levels&quot;.

=== Climate justice ===

Some climate justice approaches promote transformative justice where advocates focus on how vulnerability to climate change reflects various structural injustices in society, such as the exclusion of marginalized groups from decision-making and from climate resilient livelihoods, and that climate action must explicitly address these structural power imbalances. For these advocates, climate change provides an opportunity to reinforce democratic governance at all scales, and drive the achievement of gender equality and social inclusion. At a minimum, priority is placed on ensuring that responses to climate change do not repeat or reinforce existing injustices, which has both distributive justice and procedural justice dimensions. Other conceptions frame climate justice in terms of the need to curb climate change within certain limits, like the Paris Climate Agreement targets of 1.5C, otherwise the impacts of climate change on natural ecosystems will be so severe as to preclude the possibility of justice for many populations.

=== Sexual Violence and Harm ===
Transformative justice aims to recognize and sit with the needs and desires of victim-survivors of sexual violence in seeking justice. Acknowledging the interconnectedness of individual and social justice, advocates of transformative justice hold that experiences of intimate partner violence and sexual violence are linked to the broader ways that factors such as race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, migrant and legal status, and beyond manifest as hierarchies of power and oppression.  Recognizing that the state and formal criminal justice system often uphold these hierarchies, transformative justice responses to sexual violence often seek resolutions within community or civil society-based groups. 

As stated by the generation FIVE coalition, a response to sexual violence as grounded in transformative justice must promote:

1.     Survivor safety, healing and agency

2.     Offender accountability and transformation

3.     Community response and accountability

4.     Transformation of the community and social conditions that create and perpetuate sexual violence, i.e. systems of oppression, exploitation, domination, and State violence.

While transformative justice seeks to compassionately put the experiences of those harmed by sexual violence in conversation with the way that communities are both sites &quot;and&quot; sources of similar violence, feminist critiques of restorative justice also extend to transformative justice. Noting in particular how some victim-survivors may desire a retributive and carceral “solution”, Annalise Acorn provides important complexity to alternative modes of justice that calls on transformative justice practitioners to be attentive to the intimate and profound harm of sexual violence.

<doc id="218404" wikidata="Q1165392" url="?curid=218404" title="Restorative justice">
<text>Restorative justice is an approach to justice that aims to repair the harm done to victims. In doing so, practitioners work to ensure that offenders take responsibility for their actions, to understand the harm they have caused, to give them an opportunity to redeem themselves, and to discourage them from causing further harm. For victims, the goal is to give them an active role in the process, and to reduce feelings of anxiety and powerlessness. Restorative justice programs can also complement traditional methods, such as retributive justice, and it has been argued from the perspectives of some positions on what punishment is that some cases of restorative justice constitute punishment to those atoning.

Though academic assessment of restorative justice is positive, more recent studies have shown that academic performance falters in school districts where restorative justice is practiced. Proponents argue that most studies suggest it makes offenders less likely to re-offend. A 2007 study also found that it had a higher rate of victim satisfaction and offender accountability than traditional methods of justice delivery. However, practitioners have commented that the field has attracted increased risks of revictimization. Its use has seen worldwide growth since the 1990s. Restorative justice inspired and is part of the wider study of restorative practices.

One response to a crime, in a restorative justice program, is to organize a meeting between the victim and the offender. This is sometimes done with representatives of the wider community. The goal is for them to share their experience of what happened, to discuss who was harmed by the crime and how, and to create a consensus for what the offender can do to repair the harm from the offense. This may include a payment of money given from the offender to the victim, apologies and other amends, and other actions to compensate those affected and to prevent the offender from causing future harm. However, restorative justice practices are firmly rooted in the needs of the victim, and may simply support holding the perpetrator accountable and the sharing of victim impact statements without dialogue.

==Definition==
According to noted professor of criminology John Braithwaite, restorative justice is:
Although law professionals may have secondary roles in facilitating the restorative justice process, it is the citizens who must take up the majority of the responsibility in healing the pains caused by crime. The process of restorative justice thus shifts the responsibility for addressing crime.

In 2014, Carolyn Boyes-Watson from Suffolk University defined restorative justice as:
Reconciliation is one potential component of restorative justice. However, restorative justice does not necessarily involve reconciliation.

=== Difference from other approaches ===
According to distinguished, American criminologist and professor Howard Zehr, restorative justice differs from traditional criminal justice in terms of the guiding questions it asks. In restorative justice, the questions are:
# Who has been hurt?
# What are their needs?
# Whose obligations are these?
# What are the causes?
# Who has a stake in the situation?
# What is the appropriate process to involve stakeholders in an effort to address causes and put things right?
In contrast, traditional criminal justice asks:
# What laws have been broken?
# Who did it?
# What do the deserve?

Others, however, have argued that there are several similarities between restorative justice and traditional criminal justice and that some cases of restorative justice constitute punishment from the perspectives of some positions on what punishment is.

Restorative justice is also different from the adversarial legal process or that of civil litigation.

As Braithwaite writes, &quot;Court-annexed ADR (alternative dispute resolution) and restorative justice could not be philosophically further apart.&quot; While the former seeks to address only legally relevant issues and to protect both parties&#x27; rights, restorative justice aims at &quot;expanding the issues beyond those that are legally relevant, especially into underlying relationships.&quot;

== History ==
=== History of the term ===
The phrase &quot;restorative justice&quot; has appeared in written sources since the first half of the nineteenth century. The modern usage of the term was introduced by Albert Eglash, who in 1977 described three different approaches to justice:
# &quot;retributive justice&quot;, based on punishment;
# &quot;distributive justice&quot;, involving therapeutic treatment of offenders;
# &quot;restorative justice&quot;, based on restitution with input from victims and offenders.
Nils Christie, further elaborated the term &quot;restorative justice&quot; in his 1977 article &quot;Conflict as Property&quot; Christie argued that restorative justice aims to return conflict to those who have been harmed or have harmed.

===Precursors in indigenous groups===
According to Howard Zehr, &quot;Two people have made very specific and profound contributions to practices in the field – the Indigenous people of Canada and the United States, and the Maori of New Zealand... [I]n many ways, restorative justice represents a validation of values and practices that were characteristic of many indigenous groups,&quot; whose traditions were &quot;often discounted and repressed by western colonial powers&quot;. For example, in New Zealand, prior to European contact, the Maori had a well-developed system called Utu that protected individuals, social stability, and the integrity of the group. Restorative justice (sometimes known in these contexts as &quot;circle justice&quot;) continues to be a feature of indigenous justice systems today.

=== Development of theory ===
Zehr&#x27;s book &quot;Changing Lenses–A New Focus for Crime and Justice&quot;, first published in 1990, is credited with being &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, as well as being one of the first to articulate a theory of restorative justice. The title of this book refers to providing an alternative framework for thinking about – or new lens for viewing – crime and justice. &quot;Changing Lenses&quot; juxtaposed a &quot;retributive justice&quot; framework, where crime is viewed as an offense against the state, with a restorative justice framework, where crime is viewed as a violation of people and relationships. The book made reference to the positive results of efforts in the late 1970s and 1980s at victim–offender mediation, pioneered in the United States by Howard Zehr, Ron Claassen and Mark Umbreit.

By the second half of the 1990s, the expression &quot;restorative justice&quot; had become popular, evolving to widespread usage by 2006. The restorative justice movement has attracted many segments of society, including &quot;police officers, judges, schoolteachers, politicians, juvenile justice agencies, victim support groups, aboriginal elders, and mums and dads&quot;.

&quot;Restorative justice is a fast-growing state, national, and international social movement that seeks to bring together people to address the harm caused by crime,&quot; write Mark Umbreit and Marilyn Peterson Armour. &quot;Restorative justice views violence, community decline, and fear-based responses as indicators of broken relationships. It offers a different response, namely the use of restorative solutions to repair the harm related to conflict, crime, and victimization.&quot;

===Development of practice===
In North America, the growth of restorative justice has been facilitated by NGOs dedicated to this approach to justice, such as the Victim Offender Mediation Association, as well as by the establishment of academic centers, such as the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding at Eastern Mennonite University in Virginia, the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Center for Restorative Justice and Peacemaking, the Community Justice Institute at Florida Atlantic University, the Center for Peacemaking and Conflict Studies at Fresno Pacific University in California, the Center for Restorative Justice at the University of San Diego, and the Centre for Restorative Justice at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. Members of the Mennonites and the social-action arm of their church-community, Mennonite Central Committee, were among the early proponents. &quot;[T]he antinomian groups advocating and supporting restorative justice, such as the Mennonites (as well as Amish and Quaker groups), subscribe to principled pacifism and also tend to believe that restorative justice is much more humane than the punitive juvenile and criminal justice systems.&quot;

The development of restorative justice in continental Europe, especially the German speaking countries, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, is somewhat different from the Anglo-Saxon experience. For example, victim–offender mediation is just one model of restorative justice, but in the present European context it is the most important one. Restorative justice is not just a theory, but a practice-oriented attitude in dealing (not only) with criminal relevant conflicts. Some have argued that restorative justice may be moving towards restorative practice. 

In October 2018, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation to member states which recognised &quot;the potential benefits of using restorative justice with respect to criminal justice systems&quot; and encouraged member states to &quot;develop and use restorative justice&quot;.

==Application==
===In system-wide offenses===
The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission shows how restorative justice can be used to address system-wide offenses that affect broad swaths of a group or a society.

===In criminal cases===
In criminal cases, victims can testify about the crime&#x27;s impact upon their lives, receive answers to questions about the incident, and participate in holding the offender accountable. Meanwhile, offenders can tell their story of why the crime occurred and how it has affected their lives. They are given an opportunity to compensate the victim directly – to the degree possible. In criminal cases, this can include money, community service in general and/or specific to the offense, education to prevent recidivism, and/or expression of remorse.

A courtroom process might employ pretrial diversion, dismissing charges after restitution. In serious cases, a sentence may precede other restitution.

In the community, concerned individuals meet with all parties to assess the experience and impact of the crime. Offenders listen to victims&#x27; experiences, preferably until they are able to empathize with the experience. Then they speak to their own experience: how they decided to commit the offense. A plan is made for prevention of future occurrences, and for the offender to address the damage to the injured parties. Community members hold the accountable for adherence to the plan.

While restorative justice typically involves an encounter between the offender and the victim, some organizations, such as the Mennonite Central Committee Canada, emphasize a program&#x27;s values over its participants. This can include programs that only serve victims (or offenders for that matter), but that have a restorative framework. Indigenous groups are using the restorative justice process to try to create more community support for victims and offenders, particularly the young people. For example, different programs are underway at Kahnawake, a Mohawk reserve in Canada, and at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation of the Oglala Lakota nation, within the United States.

===In prisons===
Besides serving as an alternative to civil or criminal trial, restorative justice is also thought to be applicable to offenders who are currently incarcerated. The purpose of restorative justice in prisons is to assist with the prisoner&#x27;s rehabilitation, and eventual reintegration into society. By repairing the harm to the relationships between offenders and victims, and offenders and the community that resulted from the crime, restorative justice seeks to understand and address the circumstances which contributed to the crime. This is thought to prevent recidivism (that is, that the offender repeats the undesirable behavior) once the offender is released.

Research of a restorative reentry planning circle process in Hawai‘i was shown to help children, whose incarcerated parents had one, address the trauma they suffered from losing a parent to prison.

The potential for restorative justice to reduce recidivism is one of the strongest and most promising arguments for its use in prisons. However, there are both theoretical and practical limitations, which can make restorative justice infeasible in a prison environment. These include: difficulty engaging offenders and victims to participate in mediation; the controversial influence of family, friends, and the community; and the prevalence of mental illness among prisoners.

===In social work===
In social work cases, impoverished victims such as foster children are given the opportunity to describe their future hopes and make concrete plans to transition out of state custody in a group process with their supporters. In social justice cases, restorative justice is used for problem solving.

===In schools===
Restorative justice has been implemented in some schools. It uses a similar model to programs used by the criminal justice system. Restorative practices can &quot;also include preventive measures designed to build skills and capacity in students as well as adults&quot;. Some examples of preventive measures in restorative practices might include teachers and students devising classroom expectations together or setting up community building in the classroom. Restorative justice also focuses on justice as needs and obligations, expands justice as conversations between the offender, victim and school, and recognizes accountability as understanding the impact of actions and repairing the harm. In this approach, teachers, students and the community can reach agreements to meet all stakeholders’ needs. Collectivity is emphasized as the group must create an action plan to heal the harm and find a way to bring the offender back into the community.

While the focus is in making the whole, the added benefit of restorative justice programs are a reduction in disciplinary actions such as suspensions and expulsions resulting in lower discipline numbers reported to the state, and more effective reformative and/or reconciliatory actions imposed, such as writing apology letters, performing community service or – for example, in cases of bullying – composing a research paper on the negative effects of bullying. 
This approach develops and fosters empathy, as participating parties must come to understand the needs of all stakeholders in order for the conflict to be fully rectified. Both the offending party and the wronged/victimized party can address and begin to resolve their obstacles to achieving their education, with the aid of the restorative justice partners. Behavioral problems stemming from grief, for example, may be recognized and acknowledged within restorative justice programs; as a result, the party would be referred to a counselor to receive grief counseling. In theory, this will decrease the likelihood of the offender causing further harm. Some studies claim that taking punitive measures against a grieving person will cause more distress, leading to more troublesome behavior. 
By approaching student discipline with restorative justice in the forefront, conflicts may be resolved to meet the funding needs of the school district – by way of reduced student absenteeism, rehabilitate the offending party, and to restore justice and make whole the wronged party. Collectivity and empathy are further developed by having students participate in restorative justice circles in administering roles such as mediators or jurors.

==Methods==

Restorative justice recommends methods to hold perpetrators accountable while providing victims a voice, which includes a voluntary meeting between the offender and the victim. A 2013 Cochrane review restorative justice conferences where the offender meet the victim face-to-face, and explained that &quot;[t]he victim is encouraged to attend but is under no obligation, and in some instances the victim may be represented by another party.&quot; However, alternatives to the practice exist, such as reading victim impact statements while holding the perpetrator accountable, reducing the risk of further harm or revictimization. In addition, the meeting may include people representing the wider community.

Suggested reasons for why it can be effective include:
* The offender has to learn about the harm they have caused to their victim, making it hard for them to justify their behavior.
* It offers a chance to discuss moral development to offenders who may have had little of it in their life.
* Offenders are more likely to view their punishment as legitimate.
* The programs tend to avoid shaming and stigmatizing the offender.

Many restorative justice systems, especially victim–offender mediation and family group conferencing, require participants to sign a confidentiality agreement. These agreements usually state that conference discussions will not be disclosed to nonparticipants. The rationale for confidentiality is that it promotes open and honest communication.

===Victim-offender dialogue===
Victim–offender dialogue (VOD), (also called victim–offender mediation, victim–offender conferencing, victim–offender reconciliation, or restorative justice dialogue), is usually a meeting, in the presence of one or two trained facilitators, between victim and offender. This system generally involves few participants, and often is the only option available to incarcerated offenders. Victim Offender Dialogue originated in Canada as part of an alternative court sanction in a 1974 Kitchener, Ontario case involving two accused vandals who met face-to-face with their many victims. One of the first victim–offender mediation projects in the United Kingdom was run by South Yorkshire Probation Service from 1983 to 1986.

On May 13, 2018 in Manhattan, video showed an 87-year old man using a Citibank ATM on Broadway. A 57-year old man walked up to him from behind and hit him on the back of the head. The victim died. The original proposal was to charge the attacker with felony murder, which had a maximum sentence of life in prison. Soon afterward, Assistant Manhattan District Attorney Dafna Yoran suggested using restorative justice to reduce the charge to manslaughter, which had a maximum sentence of 10 years, on two conditions. First, the suspect had to agree to participate in a 90 minute conversation with the family of the victim. Second, the family of the victim had to agree to the reduced charge. Both of these conditions were met, and the suspect was charged with manslaughter.

===Family group conferencing===
Family group conferencing (FGC) has a wider circle of participants than VOD, adding people connected to the primary parties, such as family, friends and professionals. FGC is most commonly used for juvenile cases, due to the important role of the family in a juvenile offender&#x27;s life. Examples can be found in New South Wales, Australia, under the 1997 Young Offenders Act, and in New Zealand under the 1989 Children, Young Persons, and their Families Act. The New South Wales scheme has been favorably evaluated by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research.

Fiji uses this form of mediation when dealing with cases of child sexual assault. While it may be seen as beneficial to involve the victim&#x27;s family in the process, there are multiple issues stemming from this. For example, the vast majority of offenders are known to the victims in these cases. In a Fijian context, the notion of family extends wider than that of the normative Western idea. Therefore, involving the family in these cases may become complicated, for the family may not necessarily side with the victim or the process itself could cause rifts within the clan. Furthermore, the process as a whole places much emphasis on the victim forgiving the offender, as opposed to the offender making amends with the victim. Overall, the current process has the potential to cause great trauma and revictimise the victim.

===Restorative conferences===
Restorative conferences (RC) involves a wider circle of participants than VOD and FGC. There are many different names and procedures of operation for these community-based meetings. They are also referred to as &quot;Restorative Circles&quot;, &quot;Restorative Justice Conferences&quot;, &quot;Community Restorative Boards&quot; or &quot;Community Accountability Conferences&quot;. Specific programs have their own names, such as &quot;Community Justice Committees&quot; in Canada and &quot;Referral Order Panels&quot; in England &amp; Wales. Restorative Circles refers to restorative justice conferences in Brazil and Hawaii, though can have a wider meaning in the field of restorative practices.

A conference will typically include the victim, the offender and members of the local community, who have typically received some training. The family and friends of the offender and victim are frequently invited. RC is explicitly victim-sensitive. The community members discuss the nature and impact of the offense with the offender. The discussion continues until restitution is agreed; they may also see that the agreement is fulfilled.

The largest restorative justice conference in history took place in the course of the 1990 reconciliation campaign that ended the blood feuds among ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, which was attended by between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. The reconciliation campaign was led by Anton Çetta, and over a period of three years (1990–1992) approximately one third of the entire population of Kosovo were documented to be actively involved in restorative justice conferences to end the blood feuds.

===Circles of Support and Accountability===

&quot;Circles of Support and Accountability&quot; (CoSA) originated as a project of the &quot;Welcome In&quot;, a Mennonite church in Hamilton, Ontario. This approach has demonstrated the capacity to enhance the safe integration of otherwise high-risk sex offenders with their community. Canada judges some sex offenders too dangerous for any form of conditional release, &quot;detaining&quot; them until they serve their entire sentence. A subsequent conviction often leads to designation as a &quot;Dangerous Offender&quot;.

Prior to 1994, many such offenders were released without any support or observation beyond police surveillance. Between 1994 and 2007, CoSA assisted with the integration of well over 120 such offenders. Research indicated that surrounding a &#x27;core member&#x27; with 5–7 trained volunteer circle members reduced recidivism by nearly 80%. Further, recidivist offences were less invasive and less brutal than without the program. CoSA projects now exist in every Canadian province and every major urban centre. CoSA projects are also operational in several U.S. states (Iowa, California, Minnesota, Oregon, Ohio, Colorado, Vermont) as well as in several United Kingdom regions (Cornwall, Devon, Hampshire, Thames Valley, Leicestershire, North Wales, North Yorkshire, and Manchester).

===Sentencing circles===
&quot;Sentencing circles&quot; (sometimes called peacemaking circles) use traditional circle ritual and structure to involve all interested parties. The procedure commonly works as follows: the offender applies for the intervention, a healing circle is held for the victim, a healing circle is held for the offender, a sentencing circle is held and finally, follow-up circles to monitor progress.

==Other social movements==
=== Positive criminology and positive victimology ===
Positive criminology and positive victimology are conceptual approaches, developed by the Israeli criminologist Natti Ronel and his research team, that are well connected to restorative justice theories and practice. Positive criminology and victimology both place an emphasis on social inclusion and on unifying and integrating forces at individual, group, social and spiritual levels that are associated with the limiting of crime and recovery from victimization. In traditional approaches the study of crime, violence and related behaviors emphasizes the negative aspects in people&#x27;s lives that are associated with deviance, criminality and victimization. A common understanding is that human relationships are affected more by destructive encounters than by constructive or positive ones. Positive criminology and victimology argue that a different approach is viable, based on three dimensions – social integration, emotional healing and spirituality – that constitute positive direction indicators.

===Prison abolition===
Prison abolition not only calls for the eradication of cages, but also new perspectives and methodologies for conceptualizing crime, an aim that is shared by restorative justice. In an abolitionist style of restorative justice, participation is voluntary and not limited by the requirements of organizations or professionals, the process includes all relevant stakeholders and is mediated by an independent third party. The emphasis is on meeting the needs of and strengthening the community.

==Research==
Studies on restorative justice generally report positive outcomes. However restorative justice studies are usually self-selecting, tempering the generalizability of positive results.

A 2007 meta-study of all research projects concerning restorative justice conferencing published in English between 1986 and 2005 found positive results, specifically for victims:
* Greater ability to return to work, to resume normal daily activities, and to sleep.
* No cases of offenders verbally or violently abusing victims.
* Reduced fear of the offender (especially for violence victims); lower perceived likelihood of another offense; increased sense of security; reduced anger towards the offender; greater sympathy for the offender and the offender&#x27;s supporters; greater feelings of trust in others; increased feelings of self-confidence; reduced anxiety.

Other findings included:
* The only principled basis for selectively allowing, or banning, restorative justice is harm reduction.
* Limited public familiarity and misconceptions about restorative justice.
* Greater availability, together with information about victims&#x27; positive views is likely to increase the proportion of victims willing to participate.
However, in a 2002 meta-review of the literature focused on victim experiences, it was concluded there was no evidence that victims were more satisfied with restorative justice when compared with traditional justice.

While the principle of restorative justice makes victims central to the process research have shown that, in practice, restorative justice programs often become offender focused, minimizing the needs and experiences of victims. A 2002 study found that while the majority victims reported positive experiences with restorative justice, their level of satisfaction was lower than offenders. Some victims report feeling the offender&#x27;s apologies are disingenuous and/or that their experience and emotions are invalidated. In other studies, a minority victims have reported feeling pressured to forgive the offender, downplay the intensity of their emotions, or move quickly through the restorative justice process.

In July 2011, the International Center for Transitional Justice published a report entitled &quot;To Live as Other Kenyans do: A Study of the Demands of Kenyan Victims of Human Rights Violations&quot;. The findings are based on individual and group interviews of victims of human rights abuses from Kenya&#x27;s 2007 post-election violence. It highlights the importance of a victim-centered approach to determine the most effective mode of implementation for a comprehensive reparations program. The main finding of the report is that victims demand tangible basic benefits lost as a product of violence, such as food and shelter. It also acknowledges the need for symbolic reparations, such as formal apologies. The provision of reparations will in a sense create a restoration of the way life was before violence, and also signal the moving forward of a society through institutional change.

The COREPOL Project (Conflict Resolution, Mediation and Restorative Justice and the Policing of Ethnic Minorities in Germany, Austria and Hungary) has been researching the effects of restorative justice programs in Germany, Austria and Hungary. Its goal is to establish whether restorative justice can lead to better relations between the police and minority groups. Its first stage is to look at the extent and role of restorative justice programs within the countries. The second stage is to look at the position of certain minority populations within the societies, with the study focusing on Turks in Germany, Roma in Hungary and Africans in Austria. The involvement of the police in restorative justice programs for minority populations will be explored. Finally, the proposed research will give examples of when restorative justice can be used to improve communication and interaction between the police and minority groups. The study deals with countries that use the civil law legal system, in contrast to the common law legal system of English-speaking countries. COREPOL is coordinated by the German Police University and funded through the European Commission&#x27;s Seventh Framework Program (FP7).

===Recidivism===
Reduction of recidivism is also a goal of restorative justice, secondary to the restoration of offenders. Proponents argue that it can prevent reoffending and deter other potential criminals. Critics counter that restorative justice does not significantly influence crime rates.

While some older studies showed mixed results, as of 2013, studies that compared recidivism rates have become more definitive and in favor of restorative justice. Some studies claim modest, relative reductions, but more recent studies are finding significant and meaningful reductions in recidivism rates (see below).

A 1998 meta-analysis by Bonta et al. found that restorative justice programs caused mild reductions in reoffending rates. Latimer, Dowden and Muise carried out a meta-analysis that provided a more precise definition. conducted the second meta-analysis on the effectiveness of restorative justice. This study is important because it addresses the file-drawer problem. Also, some of the studies analyzed implemented a randomized controlled trial (a gold standard in research methods), although this does not represent the majority of studies included. This meta-analysis lends empirical support for the effectiveness of restorative justice to lower recidivism rates and increase compliance and satisfaction rates. However, the authors caution that a self-selection bias is rife through most studies of restorative justice. They reference authors from one study who found no evidence that restorative justice has a treatment effect on recidivism beyond a self-selection effect.

The third meta-analysis on the effectiveness of restorative justice was conducted by Bradshaw, Roseborough, and Umbreit in 2006. The results of this meta-analysis add empirical support for the effectiveness of restorative justice in reducing juvenile recidivism rates. Since then, studies by Baffour in (2006) and Rodriguez (2007) have also concluded that restorative justice reduces recidivism rates compared to the traditional justice system. Bergseth (2007) and Bouffard (2012) supported these findings and also concluded that there may be some long-term effects of restorative justice over the traditional justice system; as well as restorative justice being more effective with serious crimes, restorative justice participants are less likely to commit serious crimes if they do re-offend and they go longer without re-offending. All of these studies found that restorative justice is equally effective regardless of race.

In 2007, Lawrence W. Sherman and Heather Strang published a review of the previous literature and they conclude that in no way can restorative justice be more harmful than the traditional justice system. It is at least equally as effective as the traditional justice system in all cases. In most cases (especially with more serious offenses and with adult offenders) it is significantly more effective than the traditional justice system at lowering recidivism rates. It also reduced crime victims&#x27; post-traumatic stress symptoms and related costs and desires for violent revenge against their offenders. It provided both victims and offenders with more satisfaction with justice than the alternative, and saved money overall.

A 2013 meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration on the effect of youth justice conferencing on recidivism in young offenders found that there was no significant effect for restorative justice conferencing over normal court procedures for number re-arrested, nor monthly rate of reoffending. They also noted a lack of high quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of restorative justice conferencing for young offenders.

A 2023 meta-analysis found minimal support for the effectiveness of restorative justice on recidivism and no reduction of violent recidivism.

==Criticism==
Restorative justice has generally not shown improvements for recidivism rates.

According to Allison Morris, the following are some of the most common criticisms of restorative justice:

Another critique of restorative justice suggests that professionals are often left out of the restorative justice conversation. Albert W. Dzur and Susan M. Olson argue that this sector of justice cannot be successful without professionals. They claim that professionals can aid in avoiding problems that come up with informal justice and propose the theory of democratic professionalism, where professionals are not just agents of the state – as traditional understandings would suggest – but as mediums, promoting community involvement while still protecting individuals&#x27; rights.

Additionally, some critics like Gregory Shank and Paul Takagi see restorative justice as an incomplete model in that it fails to fix the fundamental, structural inequalities that make certain people more likely to be offenders than others. They and others question the structure of society and the fairness of institutional systems at their very core, pushing for addressing the root causes of many one-on-one offenses as well as for creating a socio-economic system that will be more conducive to harmonious, healthy living in general.

Some researchers agree that more research must be conducted to support the validity of restorative justice in schools, specifically in how it is implemented. More exactly, restorative justice practices that are inconsistent, insufficient, or run out of funding tend to have the worst reputations for success. While many research studies support positive findings in restorative justice, continuing studies are still needed.

Some judicial systems only recognize monetary restitution agreements. For instance, if victim and offender agree that the offender would pay $100 and mow the victim&#x27;s lawn five times, the court would only recognize the $100 as restitution. Some agreements specify a larger monetary amount (e.g., $200) to be paid if the non-monetary restitution is not completed. Many jurisdictions cap the amount which a juvenile offender can be required to pay. Labor regulations typically limit the personal service tasks that can be performed by minors. In addition, personal service usually must be approved by the juvenile&#x27;s parents. According to the Victim Offender Mediation Association, victims are not allowed to profit from restitution (the equivalent of punitive damages); only out-of-pocket losses (actual damages) can be recovered. Courts can disallow unreasonable compensation arrangements.

Both victim and offender can be hesitant to engage in victim–offender dialogue later in the criminal justice process. Once an offender starts serving a sentence, they may believe that the sentence is how they take responsibility for their actions rather than conversing with the victim. For victims, the trial and the sentencing of the offender may terminate the possibilities for discussion. For both offender and victim, victim–offender dialogue is limited in the amount of trust between the two parties.

==In the media==
Studies by Kelly M. Richards have shown that the general public would be open to the idea of alternative forms of justice, though only after the idea has been explicitly explained to them. According to other studies performed by Vicky De Mesmaecker, in order for restorative justice to become publicly accepted, there must be an effective public relations collaboration between the media and the criminologists.

The use of forgiveness as a tool has in the restorative justice programs, run for victims and perpetrators of Rwandan genocide, the violence in Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and Northern Ireland conflict, has also been documented in film, &quot;Beyond Right and Wrong: Stories of Justice and Forgiveness&quot; (2012). A tribal form of restorative justice is portrayed in the book &quot;Touching Spirit Bear&quot; by Ben Mikaelsen.

The 2004 British drama film &quot;Red Dust&quot; based on the novel by the same name tells an exemplary fictional story about the applied methodology of restorative justice used by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa).

The 2017 Canadian documentary &quot;A Better Man&quot; follows a meeting between a woman who is recovering from domestic violence and the ex-partner.

Season 2 episode 5 of the NPR podcast &quot;Mindshift&quot; compares two schools that use restorative discipline practices, one that has already made the transition and one that is just beginning to use these practices. Peace Alliance hosts a twice weekly discussion forum on restorative justice called Restorative Justice on the Rise. There is public discussion about the restorative justice movement, as well as an archive of past discussions since January 27, 2019.

In July 2020 the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Punch&quot; examined the case of Jacob Dunne who was convicted of manslaughter after landing one blow on his victim, James Hodgkinson, in a fight outside a pub. Hodgkinson did not recover and died nine days later. The programme told of the meeting between Dunne and Hodgkinson&#x27;s parents and considered the impact on both parties.

<text>An intimate part, personal part or private part is a place on the human body which is customarily kept covered by clothing in public venues and conventional settings, as a matter of fashion and cultural norms. Depending on the culture, revealing these parts can be a legal or religious offense.

== Definition ==
Definitions vary by context and culture, but the term usually refers to parts of body that are habitually covered by clothing in public places due to cultural norms, including areas such as the buttocks, groin, anus, perineum, external genitalia, and breasts.

The term &quot;intimate parts&quot; may be construed to mean only the external body parts that are visible when naked, rather than the body parts more commonly referred to. For example, when naked, a woman&#x27;s pudendal cleft is predominantly visible rather than the vagina, and a man&#x27;s scrotum is visible rather than the testes which are contained within.

== Variations ==
Female breasts are considered as parts that would be covered in most contexts but with a degree of tolerance for toplessness varying in different regions and cultures. For example, Dayna Fischtein, Edward Herold and Serge Desmarais (2005) found that acceptance of toplessness in a sample of Canadians varied depending on both personal factors (such as the respondent&#x27;s gender, age, and religion) and contextual factors (i.e., toplessness in streets, parks, or beaches).

In some periods of European history, female shoulders and legs may have been considered intimate parts. More conservative viewpoints in the West in some contexts still find it appropriate that females should cover their shoulders, particularly when entering a church or other sacred space.

In Islamic traditions, the definition of awrah is similar to the definition of intimate parts in Western culture. The extent of cover for the female body depends upon the situation, but may include the hair, shoulders, and neck in addition to the aforementioned &quot;intimate parts&quot;. A majority of scholars agree that the entire body except the face and hands should be covered in public and in front of unrelated men. The exceptions are the scholars from the Hanafi school of thought, which has the largest number of followers, which agree that the feet are not part of the awrah and therefore may be revealed. For males, most scholars regard all parts of the body from the navel to the knees as awrah.

== Considerations ==
The intentional exposure of one&#x27;s intimate parts is a form of exhibitionism. Such exposure may be subject to strict social rules, social control and even criminal justice, if it is considered to be a form of indecent exposure. The unintentional exposure of intimate parts (as in the case of a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;) may be connected with feelings of shame. For example, when actress Goldie Hawn accidentally revealed a whale tail in 2015, the American gossip website Radar Online called her the &quot;victim of a bad wardrobe malfunction&quot; and stated that she had &quot;committed a major style crime.&quot;

Intentionally touching the intimate parts of another person, even through clothing, is often associated with sexual intent. If this is done without the consent of the person being touched, it is considered groping or in some cases sexual harassment or sexual assault.

== Alternate perspectives ==
Naturism is a lifestyle choice that is characterized by the practice of nudity, both alone and in groups. Some naturists hold that nakedness is not automatically a sexual state and that covering areas of the body is merely a social construct: they believe that the norms of society can be upheld even when all are nude.

<text>Sexual assault is an act of sexual abuse in which one intentionally sexually touches another person without that person&#x27;s consent, or coerces or physically forces a person to engage in a sexual act against their will. It is a form of sexual violence that includes child sexual abuse, groping, rape (forced sexual penetration, no matter how slight), drug facilitated sexual assault, and the torture of the person in a sexual manner.

== Definition ==
Generally, sexual assault is defined as unwanted sexual contact. The National Center for Victims of Crime states:

In the United States, the definition of sexual assault varies widely among the individual states. However, in most states sexual assault occurs when there is lack of consent from one of the individuals involved. Consent must take place between two adults who are not incapacitated and consent may change, by being withdrawn, at any time during the sexual act. Sexual assault can be defined as violation of consent according to standards of substantive equality or formal equality.

== Types ==

=== Child sexual abuse ===
Child sexual abuse is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent abuses a child for sexual stimulation. Forms of child sexual abuse include asking or pressuring a child to engage in sexual activities (regardless of the outcome), indecent exposure of the genitals to a child, displaying pornography to a child, actual sexual contact against a child, physical contact with the child&#x27;s genitals, viewing of the child&#x27;s genitalia without physical contact, or using a child to produce child pornography, including live streaming sexual abuse.

The effects of child sexual abuse include depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, propensity to re-victimization in adulthood, physical injury to the child, and increased risk for future interpersonal violence perpetration among males, among other problems. Sexual assault among teenagers has been shown to lead to worse school performance, an increase in mental health problems, and social exclusion. Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest. It is more common than other forms of sexual assault on a child and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma, especially in the case of parental incest.

Approximately 15 to 25 percent of women and 5 to 15 percent of men were sexually abused when they were children. Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims. Approximately 30 percent of the perpetrators are relatives of the child – most often brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts or cousins. Around 60 percent are other acquaintances such as friends of the family, babysitters, or neighbors. Strangers are the offenders in approximately 10 percent of child sexual abuse cases.

Studies have shown that the psychological damage is particularly severe when sexual assault is committed by parents against children due to the incestuous nature of the assault. Incest between a child and a related adult has been identified as the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity for damage to a child. Often, sexual assault on a child is not reported by the child for several of the following reasons:

*children are too young to recognize their victimization or put it into words
*they were threatened or bribed by the abuser
*they feel confused by fearing the abuser
*they are afraid no one will believe them
*they blame themselves or believe the abuse is a punishment
*they feel guilty for consequences to the perpetrator

In addition, many states have criminalized sexual contact between teachers or school administrators and students, even if the student is over the age of consent.

=== Domestic violence ===

Domestic violence is violence or other abuse by one person against another in a domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. It is strongly correlated with sexual assault. Not only can domestic abuse be emotional, physical, psychological and financial, but it can be sexual. Some of the signs of sexual abuse are similar to those of domestic violence.

=== Elderly sexual assault ===

About 30 percent of people age 65 or older who are sexually assaulted in the U.S. report it to the police. Assailants may include strangers, caretakers, adult children, spouses and fellow facility residents, although perpetrators of elder sexual assault are less likely to be related to the victim than perpetrators of other types of elder abuse.

=== Groping ===

The term &quot;groping&quot; is used to define the touching or fondling of another person in a sexual way without the person&#x27;s consent. Groping may occur under or over clothing.

=== Rape ===
Outside of law, the term &quot;rape&quot; (sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person&#x27;s consent) is often used interchangeably with sexual assault. Although closely related, the two terms are technically distinct in most jurisdictions. Sexual assault typically includes rape and other forms of non-consensual sexual activity.

Abbey &quot;et al.&quot; state that female victims are much more likely to be assaulted by an acquaintance, such as a friend or co-worker, a dating partner, an ex-boyfriend or a husband or other intimate partner than by a complete stranger. In a study of hospital emergency room treatments for rape, Kaufman &quot;et al.&quot; stated that the male victims as a group sustained more physical trauma and were more likely to have been a victim of multiple assaults from multiple assailants. It was also stated that male victims were more likely to have been held captive longer.

In the U.S., rape is a crime committed primarily against youth. A national telephone survey on violence against women conducted by the National Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 18% of women surveyed had experienced a completed or attempted rape at some time in their lives. Of these, 22% were younger than 12 years and 32% were between 12 and 17 years old when they were first raped.

In the U.K., attempted rape under the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 is a &#x27;sexual offence&#x27; within section 31(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991.

The removal of a condom during intercourse without the consent of the sex partner, known as stealthing, may be treated as a sexual assault or rape in some jurisdictions.

=== Sexual harassment ===

Sexual harassment is intimidation, bullying or coercion of a sexual nature. It may also be defined as the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. The legal and social definition of what constitutes sexual harassment differ widely by culture. Sexual harassment includes a wide range of behaviors from seemingly mild transgressions to serious forms of abuse. Some forms of sexual harassment overlap with sexual assault.

In the United States, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination which violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC): &quot;Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual&#x27;s employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual&#x27;s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.&quot;

In the United States:
*79% of victims are women, 21% are men
** 51% are harassed by a supervisor
** Business, Trade, Banking, and Finance are the biggest industries where sexual harassment occurs
** 12% received threats of termination if they did not comply with their requests
* 26,000 people in the armed forces were assaulted in 2012[18]
** 302 of the 2,558 cases pursued by victims were prosecuted
** 38% of the cases were committed by someone of a higher rank
* Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
** Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. It generally applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including federal, state, and local governments. Title VII also applies to private and public colleges and universities, employment agencies, and labor organizations.[19]
** &quot;It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual&#x27;s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot;[20]

=== Mass sexual assault ===

Mass sexual assault takes place in public places and in crowds. It involves large group of people surrounding and assaulting the other gender and engaging in conduct such as groping, manual penetration, and frottage, but usually stopping short of penile rape.

== Emotional and psychological effects ==
Aside from physical traumas, rape and other sexual assault often result in long-term emotional effects, particularly in child victims. These can include, but are not limited to: denial, learned helplessness, genophobia (fear of sex), anger, self-blame, anxiety, shame, nightmares, fear, depression, flashbacks, guilt, rationalization, moodswings, numbness, hypersexuality, loneliness, social anxiety, difficulty trusting oneself or others, and difficulty concentrating.

Sexual assault increases an individual&#x27;s risk to developing psychopathology. It is most strongly related to the development of suicidality and trauma-related disorders (including post-traumatic stress disorder), as well as the development of bipolar and obsessive–compulsive disorders. Experiencing sexual assault also increases the risk of developing anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, addiction, or other psychopathologies. Individuals who develop psychological disorders following sexual assault have increased frequency and severity of psychopathology compared with individuals who have not experienced sexual assault.

Family and friends of individuals who have been sexually assaulted experience emotional scarring, including a strong desire for revenge, a desire to &quot;fix&quot; the problem and/or move on, and a rationalization that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t that bad&quot;.

== Physical effects ==
While sexual assault, including rape, can result in physical trauma, many people who experience sexual assault will not suffer any physical injury. Rape myths suggest that the stereotypical victim of sexual violence is a bruised and battered young woman. The central issue in many cases of rape or other sexual assault is whether or not both parties consented to the sexual activity or whether or not both parties had the capacity to do so. Thus, physical force resulting in visible physical injury is not always seen. This stereotype can be damaging because people who have experienced sexual assault but have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care. However, women who experienced rape or physical violence by a partner were more likely than people who had not experienced this violence to report frequent headaches, chronic pain, difficulty sleeping, activity limitation, poor physical health, and poor mental health.

== Economic effects ==
Due to rape or sexual assault, or the threat of, there are many resulting impacts on income and commerce at the macro level. Excluding child abuse, each rape or sexual assault costs $5,100 in tangible losses (lost productivity, medical and mental health care, police/fire services, and property damage) and $81,400 in lost quality of life. This issue has been addressed in the Supreme Court. In his dissenting opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;U.S. v. Morrison&quot;, Justice Souter explained that 75% of women never go to the movies alone at night and nearly 50% will not ride public transportation out of fear of rape or sexual assault. It also stated that less than 1% of victims collect damages and 50% of women lose their jobs or quit after the trauma. The court ruled in &quot;U.S. v. Morrison&quot; that Congress did not have the authority to enact part of the Violence Against Women Act because it did not have a direct impact on commerce. The Commerce Clause of Article I Section VII of the U.S. Constitution gives authority and jurisdiction to the Federal government in matters of interstate commerce. As a result, the victim was unable to sue her attacker in Federal Court.

Sexual assault also has adverse economic effects for survivors on the micro level. For instance, survivors of sexual assault often require time off from work and face increased rates of unemployment. Survivors of rape by an intimate partner lose an average of $69 per day due to unpaid time off from work. Sexual assault is also associated with numerous negative employment consequences, including unpaid time off, diminished work performance, job loss, and inability to work, all of which can lead to lower earnings for survivors.

The ability to test backlogged sexual assault kits and have the results uploaded into CODIS is cost effective in terms of reducing the costs associated with sexual assaults&#x27; by spending the money on testing evidence.

== Treatment of victims ==
In the emergency room, emergency contraceptive medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy. Preventative medication against sexually transmitted infections are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis). Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if five years have elapsed since the last immunization. Short-term treatment with a benzodiazepine may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of PTSD, depression and panic attacks. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has also been proposed as a psychiatric treatment for victims of sexual assault. With regard to long term psychological treatment, prolonged exposure therapy has been tested as a method of long-term PTSD treatment for victims of sexual abuse.

== Mistreatment of victims ==
After the assault, victims may become the target of slut-shaming to cyberbullying. In addition, their credibility may be challenged. During criminal proceedings, publication bans and rape shield laws may operate to protect victims from excessive public scrutiny. Negative social responses to victims&#x27; disclosures of sexual assault have the potential to lead to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Social isolation, following a sexual assault, can result in the victim experiencing a decrease in their self-esteem and likelihood of rejecting unwanted sexual advances in the future. Victims have already been through a traumatic assault and it can be exacerbated the unwillingness of law enforcement to move their case along in the forensic testing process because law enforcement officials develop preconceived notions about the victims willingness to participate in the investigation.

== Prevention ==

Sexual harassment and assault may be prevented by secondary school, college, workplace and public education programs. At least one program for fraternity men produced &quot;sustained behavioral change&quot;. At least one study showed that creative campaigns with attention grabbing slogans and images that market consent are effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.

Several research-based rape prevention programs have been tested and verified through scientific studies. The rape prevention programs that have the strongest empirical data in the research literature include the following:

The Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Programs, also known as the One in Four programs, were written by John Foubert. and is focused on increasing empathy toward rape survivors and motivating people to intervene as bystanders in sexual assault situations. Published data shows that high-risk persons who saw the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Program committed 40% fewer acts of sexually coercive behavior than those who did not. They also committed acts of sexual coercion that were eight times less severe than a control group. Further research also shows that people who saw the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Program reported more efficacy in intervening and greater willingness to help as a bystander after seeing the program. Several additional studies are available documenting its efficacy.

Bringing in the Bystander was written by Victoria Banyard. Its focus is on who bystanders are, when they have helped, and how to intervene as a bystander in risky situations. The program includes a brief empathy induction component and a pledge to intervene in the future. Several studies show strong evidence of favorable outcomes including increased bystander efficacy, increased willingness to intervene as a bystander, and decreased rape myth acceptance.

The MVP: Mentors in Violence Prevention was written by Jackson Katz. This program focuses on discussing a male bystander who did not intervene when a woman was in danger. An emphasis is placed on encouraging men to be active bystanders, rather than standing by when they notice abuse. The bulk of the presentation is on processing hypothetical scenarios. Outcomes reported in research literature include lower levels of sexism and increased belief that participants could prevent violence against women.

The Green Dot program was written by Dorothy Edwards. This program includes both motivational speeches and peer education focused on bystander intervention. Outcomes show that program participation is associated with reductions in rape myth acceptance and increased bystander intervention.

The city of Edmonton, Canada, initiated a public education campaign aimed at potential perpetrators. Posters in bar bathrooms and public transit centers reminded men that &quot;It&#x27;s not sex when she&#x27;s wasted&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s not sex when he changes his mind&quot;. The campaign was so effective that it spread to other cities. &quot;The number of reported sexual assaults fell by 10 per cent last year in Vancouver, after the ads were featured around the city. It was the first time in several years that there was a drop in sexual assault activity.&quot;

President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden introduced in September 2014 a nationwide campaign against sexual assault entitled &quot;It&#x27;s on us&quot;. The campaign includes tips against sexual assault, as well as broad scale of private and public pledges to change to provoke a cultural shift, with a focus on student activism, to achieve awareness and prevention nationwide. UC Berkeley, NCAA and Viacom have publicly announced their partnership.

Additionally, CODIS checks whether the qualifying offense sample, DNA taken from an offender for committing a crime, was also a sexual assault. If a person committed sexual offenses in the past, this system would reveal a pattern of serial sexual offending. Using CODIS to compare backlogged rape kit tests can lead to prevention of future sexual assaults.

== Prevalence ==

A United Nations report compiled from government sources showed that more than 250,000 cases of rape or attempted rape were recorded by police annually. The reported data covered 65 countries.

=== By country ===
The annual recorded sexual assaults per capita for the last available year is shown below for individual countries. Definition of sexual assault differs between countries.

=== United States ===
The U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s National Crime Victimization Survey states that on average there are 237,868 victims (age 12 or older) of sexual assault and rape each year. According to RAINN, every 107 seconds someone in America is sexually assaulted. Sexual assault in the United States military also is a salient issue. Some researchers assert that the unique professional and socially-contained context of military service can heighten the destructive nature of sexual assault, and, therefore, improved support is needed for these victims.

The victims of sexual assault:

Age
*15% are under the age of 12
*29% are age 12–17
*44% are under age 18
*80% are under age 30
*12–34 are the highest risk years.

By gender

A study from 2011 finds that,
*19.3% of women have been victims of attempted (7.8%) or completed (11.5%) rape during their lifetime.
*An estimated 1.7% of men have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime.
*Over 23 million women have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime.
*Almost 2 million men have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime.
*An estimated 7.6 million men have been forced to penetrate during their lifetime, 71% having done so before the age of 25.

The National Crime Victimization Survey conducted by the U.S. Justice Department (Bureau of Justice Statistics) found that from 1995 to 2013, men represented 17% of victims of sexual assault and rape on college campuses, and 4% of non-campus sexual assaults and rapes.

LGBT

LGBT identifying individuals, with the exception of lesbian women, are more likely to experience sexual assault on college campuses than heterosexual individuals.

College
In the United States, several studies since 1987 have indicated that one in four college women have experienced rape or attempted rape at some point in their lifetime. These studies are based on anonymous surveys of college women, not reports to the police, and the results are disputed.

In 2015, Texas A&amp;M University professor Jason Lindo and his colleagues analyzed over two decades worth of FBI data, noting that reports of rape increased 15–57% around the times of major American Football games at Division 1 schools while attempting to find a link between campus rape and alcohol.

A 2006 report from the U.S. Department of Justice titled &quot;The Sexual Victimization of College Women&quot; reports that 3.1% of undergraduates survived rape or attempted rape during a 6–7 month academic year with an additional 10.1% surviving rape prior to college and an additional 10.9% surviving attempted rape prior to college. With no overlap between these groups, these percentages add to 24.1%, or &quot;One in Four&quot;.

Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski published a study in 1987 where they interviewed approximately 6,000 college students on 32 college campuses nationwide. They asked several questions covering a wide range of behaviors. From this study 15% of college women answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of rape. An additional 12% of women answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of attempted rape, thus the statistic One in Four.

A point of contention lies in the leading nature of the questions in the study conducted by Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski. Koss herself later admitted that the question that had garnered the largest &quot;rape&quot; result was flawed and ultimately rendered the study invalid. Most prominently the problem was that many respondents who had answered yes to several questions had their responses treated as having been raped. The issue being that these same respondents did not feel they had been victimized and never sought redress for grievances. The resultant change shows a prevalence of only 1 in 22 college women having been raped or attempted to be raped during their time at college.

In 1995, the CDC replicated part of this study, however they examined rape only, and did not look at attempted rape. They used a two-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years. The first-stage sampling frame contained 2,919 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. The second sampling stage consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the 136 participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to 4,609 undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic. Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female, black and Hispanic students in the total sample population. After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other. It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime. Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; 20% of approximately 2500 females (55% of 4,609 samples) and 3.9% of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime.

Other studies concerning the annual incidence of rape, some studies conclude an occurrence of 5%. The National Survey of Children&#x27;s Exposure to Violence found that in the 2013–2014 academic year, 4.6% of girls ages 14–17 experienced sexual assault or sexual abuse. In another study, Mohler-Kuo, Dowdall, Koss &amp; Weschler (2004) found in a study of approximately 25,000 college women nationwide that 4.7% experienced rape or attempted rape during a single academic year. This study did not measure lifetime incidence of rape or attempted rape. Similarly, Kilpatrick, Resnick, Ruggiero, Conoscenti, &amp; McCauley (2007) found in a study of 2,000 college women nationwide that 5.2% experienced rape every year.

On campuses, it has been found that alcohol is a prevalent issue in regards to sexual assault. It has been estimated that 1 in 5 women experience an assault, and of those women, 50–75% have had either the attacker, the woman, or both, consume alcohol prior to the assault. Not only has it been a factor in the rates of sexual assault on campus, but because of the prevalence, assaults are also being affected specifically by the inability to give consent when intoxicated and bystanders not knowing when to intervene due to their own intoxication or the intoxication of the victim.

Children

Other research has found that about 80,000 American children are sexually abused each year.

== By jurisdiction ==

=== Australia ===

Within Australia, the term sexual assault is used to describe a variation of sexual offences. This is due to a variety of definitions and use of terminology to describe sexual offences within territories and states as each territory and state have their own legislation to define rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual penetration or intercourse without consent and sexual violence.

In the State of New South Wales, sexual assault is a statutory offence punishable under s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. The term &quot;sexual assault&quot; is equivalent to &quot;rape&quot; in ordinary parlance, while all other assaults of a sexual nature are termed &quot;indecent assault&quot;.

To be liable for punishment under the Crimes Act 1900, an offender must intend to commit an act of sexual intercourse as defined under s 61H(1) while having one of the states of knowledge of non-consent defined under s 61HA(3). But s 61HA(3) is an objective standard which only require the person has no reasonable grounds for believing the other person is consenting. The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years imprisonment.

Aggravated sexual assault is sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years under s 61J of the Crimes Act.

In the state of Victoria, rape is punishable under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1958, with a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.

In the state of South Australia, rape is punishable under s 48 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) with a maximum term of life imprisonment.

In the state of Western Australia, sexual penetration is punishable under s 325 the Criminal Code Act 1913 with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.

In the Northern Territory, offences of sexual intercourse and gross indecency without consent are punishable under s 192 of the Criminal Code Act 1983 and punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

In Queensland, rape and sexual assault are punishable under s 349, Chapter 32 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

In Tasmania, rape is punishable under s 185 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 with a maximum punishment of 21 years under s389 of the Criminal Code Act 1924.

In the Australian Capital Territory, sexual assault is punishable under Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum punishment of 17 years.

Sexual assault is considered a gendered crime which results in 85% of sexual assaults never coming to the attention of the criminal justice system according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This is due to low reporting rates, treatment of victims and distrust of the criminal justice system, difficulty in obtaining evidence and the belief in sexual assault myths.

However, once a person is charged, the public prosecutor will decide whether the case will proceed to trial based on whether there is sufficient evidence and whether a case is in the public interest. Once the matter has reached trial, the matter will generally be heard in the District Court. This is because sexually violent crimes are mostly categorised as indictable offences (serious offences), as opposed to summary offences (minor offences). Sexual offences can also be heard in the Supreme Court, but more generally if the matter is being heard as an appeal.

Once the matter is being heard, the prosecution must provide evidence which proves &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; that the offence was committed by the defendant. The standard of proof is vital in checking the power of the State. While as previously stated that each jurisdiction (State and Territory) has its own sexual offence legislation, there are many common elements to any criminal offence that advise on how the offence is defined and what must be proven by the prosecution in order to find the defendant guilty. These elements are known as Actus Reus which comprises the physical element (see Ryan v Regina [1967]) and the Mens Rea which comprises the mental element (see He Kaw Teh (1985)).

Notable sexual assault cases which have resulted in convictions are Regina v Bilal Skaf [2005] and Regina v Mohommed Skaf [2005] which were highly visible in New South Wales within the media the 2000s. These cases were closely watched by the media and led to legislative changes such as the passing of the Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62 which dramatically increased the sentences for &#x27;gang rapists&#x27; by creating a new category of crime known as Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company. Changes were also made to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This change is known as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3 which expands the category of offences in respect of which a Local Court may receive and consider Victim Impact Statements to include some indictable offences which are usually dealt with summarily.

=== Canada ===
Sexual assault is defined as sexual contact with another person without that other person&#x27;s consent. Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as &quot;the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question&quot;.

Section 265 of the Criminal Code defines the offences of assault and sexual assault.

Section 271 criminalizes &quot;Sexual assault&quot;, section 272 criminalizes &quot;Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm&quot; and section 273 criminalizes &quot;Aggravated sexual assault&quot;.

==== Consent ====
The absence of consent defines the crime of sexual assault. Section 273.1 (1) defines consent, section 273.1 (2) outlines certain circumstances where &quot;no consent&quot; is obtained, while section 273.1 (3) states that subsection (2) &quot;does not limit&quot; the circumstances where &quot;no consent&quot; is obtained (i.e. subsection (2) describes &quot;some&quot; circumstances which deem the act to be non-consensual, but other circumstances, not described in this section, can also deem the act as having been committed without consent). &quot;No consent&quot; to sexual assault is also subject to Section 265 (3), which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non-consensual. In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;R. v. J.A.&quot; interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent, and that they cannot give consent in advance.

*&quot;Meaning of &quot;consent&quot;&quot;

&quot;273.1&quot; (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), &quot;consent&quot; means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, &quot;the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question&quot;.

&quot;Where no consent obtained&quot;

(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where
(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;
(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;
(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;
(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity; or
(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

&quot;Subsection (2) not limiting&quot;

(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.

*&quot;Section 265(3)&quot;

&quot;Consent&quot;

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of
(a) the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(b) threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(c) fraud; or
(d) the exercise of authority.

In accordance with 265 (4) an accused may use the defence that he or she believed that the complainant consented, but such a defence may be used only when &quot;a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused&#x27;s belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief&quot;; furthermore according to section 273.2(b) the accused must show that he or she took reasonable steps in order to ascertain the complainant&#x27;s consent, also 273.2(a) states that if the accused&#x27;s belief steams from self-induced intoxication, or recklessness or wilful blindness than such belief is not a defence.

*&quot;265 (4)&quot;
&quot;Accused&#x27;s belief as to consent&quot;

(4) Where an accused alleges that he or she believed that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused&#x27;s belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

*&quot;Where belief in consent not a defence&quot;

273.2 It is not a defence to a charge under section 271, 272 or 273 that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, where
(a) the accused&#x27;s belief arose from the accused&#x27;s

(i) self-induced intoxication, or

(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or
(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.

==== Supreme Court partial interpretation of &quot;consent&quot; ====

The Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador jury ruled in favour of a defense that added to the interpretation of the consent laws. The defenses stated and the Jury was reminded by Justice Valerie Marshall:

*because a complainant is drunk does not diminish their capacity to consent.
*because a complainant cannot remember if they gave consent does not mean they could not have consented.

The coined phrase regarding this defense was &quot;&quot;Moral vs. legal consent&quot;.&quot;

=== Germany ===

Before 1997, the definition of rape was: &quot;Whoever compels a woman to have extramarital intercourse with him, or with a third person, by force or the threat of present danger to life or limb, shall be punished by not less than two years&#x27; imprisonment.&quot;

In 1997, a broader definition was adopted with the 13th criminal amendment, section 177–179, which deals with sexual abuse. Rape is generally reported to the police, although it is also allowed to be reported to the prosecutor or District Court.

The Strafgesetzbuch reads:

:Section 177
:Sexual assault by use of force or threats; rape

#Whosoever coerces another person
##by force;
##by threat of imminent danger to life or limb; or
##by exploiting a situation in which the victim is unprotected and at the mercy of the offender,
#:to suffer sexual acts by the offender or a third person on their own person or to engage actively in sexual activity with the offender or a third person, shall be liable to imprisonment of not less than one year.
#In especially serious cases the penalty shall be imprisonment of not less than two years. An especially serious case typically occurs if
##the offender performs sexual intercourse with the victim or performs similar sexual acts with the victim, or allows them to be performed on himself by the victim, especially if they degrade the victim or if they entail penetration of the body (rape); or
##the offence is committed jointly by more than one person.

Subsections (3), (4) and (5) provide additional stipulations on sentencing depending on aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

Section 178 provides that &quot;If the offender through sexual assault or rape (section 177) causes the death of the victim at least by gross negligence the penalty shall be imprisonment for life or not less than ten years.&quot;

=== Republic of Ireland ===
As in many other jurisdictions, the term sexual assault is generally used to describe non-penetrative sexual offences. Section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981 states that a man has committed rape if he has sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it, and at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it. Under Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape Amendment) Act of 1990, rape means a sexual assault that includes penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. The maximum penalty for rape in Ireland is imprisonment for life.

=== South Africa ===
The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act replaced the common-law offence of indecent assault with a statutory offence of sexual assault, defined in section 5 of the act as follows.

The act&#x27;s definition of &quot;sexual violation&quot; incorporates a number of sexual acts, including genital contact short of penetration as well as any contact with the mouth designed to cause sexual arousal. Non-consensual acts that involve actual penetration are included in the separate offence of rape rather than sexual assault.

The Act also created the offences of &quot;compelled sexual assault&quot;, when a person forces a second person to commit an act of sexual violation with a third person; and &quot;compelled self-sexual assault&quot;, when a person forces another person to masturbate or commit various other sexual acts on theirself.

===Spain===
In August 2022, Spain passed a revolutionary &quot;only yes means yes&quot; sexual consent law which expanded the legal definition of sexual assault in Spain to being also sexual-related conduct without consent and now required that consent must be affirmative and cannot be assumed to have been given by default or silence. It also increased the nation&#x27;s maximum rape sentence to 15 years, in tandem with 15-year sentences that were handed to perpetrators in the nation&#x27;s 2016 wolf pack gang rape case. However, it did receive some criticism for the way it enacted sentencing reductions for some offenders. The law went into effect in October 2022. It was later amended in April 2023 to close loopholes which contributed to the sentence reduction controversy.

=== United Kingdom ===

==== England and Wales ====
Sexual assault is a statutory offence in England and Wales. It is created by section 3 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which defines &quot;sexual assault&quot; as when a person (A)

Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.

Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.

A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable—
#on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or both;
#on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.

Offences committed before the 2003 Act came into force are prosecuted under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (or in theory earlier legislation), in particular indecent assault.

===== Consent =====
Section 74 of the Sexual Offenses Act explains that &quot;a person consents if he agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice&quot;.

Section 75 provides a rebuttable presumption that there was no consent in case of violence, intimidation, unlawful imprisonment, unconsciousness, or physical disability or drugs that impair the ability to give consent.

==== Northern Ireland ====
Sexual assault is a statutory offence. It is created by article 7 of the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. Sexual assault is defined as follows:
==== Scotland ====
Sexual assault is a statutory offence. It is created by section 3 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009.
Sexual assault is defined as follows:

=== United States ===
The United States Department of Justice defines sexual assault as &quot;any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.&quot;

Every U.S. state has its own code of laws, and thus the definition of conduct that constitutes a crime, including a sexual assault, may vary to some degree by state. Some states may refer to sexual assault as &quot;sexual battery&quot; or &quot;criminal sexual conduct&quot;.

==== Texas ====
The Texas Penal Code, Sec. 22.011(a) defines sexual assault as

<text>Multiversion concurrency control (MCC or MVCC), is a non-locking concurrency control method commonly used by database management systems to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to implement transactional memory.

==Description==
Without concurrency control, if someone is reading from a database at the same time as someone else is writing to it, it is possible that the reader will see a half-written or inconsistent piece of data. For instance, when making a wire transfer between two bank accounts if a reader reads the balance at the bank when the money has been withdrawn from the original account and before it was deposited in the destination account, it would seem that money has disappeared from the bank. Isolation is the property that provides guarantees in the concurrent accesses to data. Isolation is implemented by means of a concurrency control protocol. The simplest way is to make all readers wait until the writer is done, which is known as a read-write lock. Locks are known to create contention especially between long read transactions and update transactions. MVCC aims at solving the problem by keeping multiple copies of each data item. In this way, each user connected to the database sees a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the database at a particular instant in time. Any changes made by a writer will not be seen by other users of the database until the changes have been completed (or, in database terms: until the transaction has been committed.)

When an MVCC database needs to update a piece of data, it will not overwrite the original data item with new data, but instead creates a newer version of the data item. Thus there are multiple versions stored. The version that each transaction sees depends on the isolation level implemented. The most common isolation level implemented with MVCC is snapshot isolation. With snapshot isolation, a transaction observes a state of the data as of when the transaction started.

MVCC provides point-in-time consistent views. Read transactions under MVCC typically use a timestamp or transaction ID to determine what state of the DB to read, and read these versions of the data. Read and write transactions are thus isolated from each other without any need for locking. However, despite locks being unnecessary, they are used by some MVCC databases such as Oracle. Writes create a newer version, while concurrent reads access an older version.

MVCC introduces the challenge of how to remove versions that become obsolete and will never be read. In some cases, a process to periodically sweep through and delete the obsolete versions is implemented. This is often a stop-the-world process that traverses a whole table and rewrites it with the last version of each data item. PostgreSQL can use this approach with its VACUUM FREEZE process. Other databases split the storage blocks into two parts: the data part and an undo log. The data part always keeps the last committed version. The undo log enables the recreation of older versions of data. The main inherent limitation of this latter approach is that when there are update-intensive workloads, the undo log part runs out of space and then transactions are aborted as they cannot be given their snapshot. For a document-oriented database it also allows the system to optimize documents by writing entire documents onto contiguous sections of disk—when updated, the entire document can be re-written rather than bits and pieces cut out or maintained in a linked, non-contiguous database structure.

==Implementation==
MVCC uses timestamps (TS), and &quot;incrementing transaction IDs&quot;, to achieve &quot;transactional consistency&quot;. MVCC ensures a transaction (T) never has to wait to &quot;Read&quot; a database object (P) by maintaining several versions of the object. Each version of object P has both a &quot;Read Timestamp&quot; (RTS) and a &quot;Write Timestamp&quot; (WTS) which lets a particular transaction Ti read the most recent version of the object which precedes the transaction&#x27;s &quot;Read Timestamp&quot; RTS(Ti).

, for the object &quot;Write Operation&quot; (WTS) to succeed. A &quot;Write&quot; cannot complete if there are other outstanding transactions with an earlier Read Timestamp (RTS) to the same object. Like standing in line at the store, you cannot complete your checkout transaction until those in front of you have completed theirs.

To restate; every object (P) has a &quot;Timestamp&quot; (TS), however if transaction Ti wants to &quot;Write&quot; to an object, and the transaction has a &quot;Timestamp&quot; (TS) that is earlier than the object&#x27;s current Read Timestamp, TS(Ti) &lt; RTS(P), then the transaction is aborted and restarted. (This is because a later transaction already depends on the old value.) Otherwise, Ti creates a new version of object P and sets the read/write timestamp TS of the new version to the timestamp of the transaction TS ← TS(Ti).

The drawback to this system is the cost of storing multiple versions of objects in the database. On the other hand, reads are never blocked, which can be important for workloads mostly involving reading values from the database. MVCC is particularly adept at implementing true snapshot isolation, something which other methods of concurrency control frequently do either incompletely or with high performance costs.

A structure to hold a record (row) for a database using MVCC could look like this in Rust.

struct Record {
 /// Insert transaction identifier stamp.
 insert_transaction_id: u32,

 /// Delete transaction identifier stamp.
 delete_transaction_id: u32,

 /// The length of the data.
 data_length: u16,

 /// The content of the record.
 data: Vec&lt;u8&gt;,



;
;

== Examples ==

=== Concurrent read–write ===
At Time = 1, the state of a database could be:

T0 wrote Object 1=&quot;Foo&quot; and Object 2=&quot;Bar&quot;. After that T1 wrote Object 1=&quot;Hello&quot; leaving Object 2 at its original value. The new value of Object 1 will supersede the value at 0 for all transactions that start after T1 commits at which point version 0 of Object 1 can be garbage collected.

If a long running transaction T2 starts a read operation of Object 2 and Object 1 after T1 committed and there is a concurrent update transaction T3 which deletes Object 2 and adds Object 3=&quot;Foo-Bar&quot;, the database state will look like this at time 2:

There is a new version as of time 2 of Object 2 which is marked as deleted and a new Object 3. Since T2 and T3 run concurrently T2 sees the version of the database before 2 i.e. before T3 committed writes, as such T2 reads Object 2=&quot;Bar&quot; and Object 1=&quot;Hello&quot;. This is how multiversion concurrency control allows snapshot isolation reads without any locks.

==History==
Multiversion concurrency control is described in some detail in the 1981 paper &quot;Concurrency Control in Distributed Database Systems&quot; by Phil Bernstein and Nathan Goodman, then employed by the Computer Corporation of America. Bernstein and Goodman&#x27;s paper cites a 1978 dissertation by David P. Reed which quite clearly describes MVCC and claims it as an original work.

The first shipping, commercial database software product featuring MVCC was VAX Rdb/ELN, released in 1984, and created at Digital Equipment Corporation by Jim Starkey. Starkey went on to create the second commercially successful MVCC database - InterBase.

<text>Coamo (, ) is a town and municipality founded in 1579 in the south-central region of Puerto Rico, located north of Santa Isabel; south of Orocovis and Barranquitas; east of Villalba and Juana Díaz; and west of Aibonito and Salinas. The municipality of Coamo is spread over 10 barrios and Coamo Pueblo – the town or downtown area and administrative center of the city. The Coamo municipality is also a Micropolitan Statistical Area and as such is part of the Ponce-Yauco-Coamo Combined Statistical Area.

The town of Coamo and parts of its barrios are nestled in a valley about east of the town of Ponce (about 40 minutes by car). It was named San Blas Illescas de Coamo by Spanish settlers in 1579. Saint Blaise (&quot;San Blas&quot;) was designated by the Catholic Church as the patron saint of the town, and so it remains presently. &quot;Illescas&quot; is the Spanish town where some of the town founders originated (nowadays in Toledo province, Castile-La Mancha, Spain).

There are several theories regarding the origin of the word &quot;Coamo&quot;. One theory is that it comes from an indigenous word that means &quot;valley&quot;. Another theory is that Coamo derives its name from &quot;Coamex&quot; (or &quot;Coamey&quot;), who was a celebrated local cacique. Archeological digs in the municipality of Coamo have produced extensive evidence of pre-Columbian inhabitants of the area. 

Coamo is famous for its natural hot springs, Los Baños de Coamo&quot;,&quot; and for its annual San Blas Half Marathon. The Battle of Coamo was a decisive battle of the Spanish–American War (1898).

==History==
When Spanish settlers arrived, Coamo was inhabited by the Taino. Modern archeology has found evidence of at least four pre-columbian villages in the territory that is today the Coamo municipality:

* &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; village was located in the current downtown southern section, were today is Buenos Aires Street
* &quot;Baños de Coamo&quot; village was located by the hot springs, across the river from the modern baths.
* &quot;Cuyón&quot; village was located in what is now Cuyón barrio
* &quot;Las Flores&quot; village was located west of the Las Flores neighborhood in San Ildefonso barrio. Artifacts found here suggest a high status cacique lived here.

It is believed the Coamo villages had strong ties with the coastal village &quot;El Cayito&quot; (in what is now Santa Isabel municipality) and the &quot;Toíta&quot; village (in what is now Cayey municipality) due to the large quantities of marine shellfish remains found in the Coamo and Cayey villages.

After the Taino rebellion of 1511 was defeated by the Spanish fuerzas españolas, the hard labor in encomiendas, epidemics of smallpox and other European diseases, and conversion to Catholicism and intermarriage with Spanish colonist contributed to the assimilation of the Taino into the Spanish society and culture.

Founded on July 15, 1579, the town of Coamo is the third-oldest settlement of the island&#x27;s post-Columbian period (after San Juan in the north and San Germán in the west). At that time, Coamo was the administrative center for a larger area that would eventually be subdivided into several municipalities: Guayama, Cayey, Juana Díaz, Orocovis, Barranquitas, Cidra, Patillas, Aibonito, Santa Isabel, Salinas and Arroyo.

By 1582, there were twenty families living in Coamo, in the same area where the Tainos had had their village of Guayama . Coamo officially became a town in 1616, and was given the title of &quot;Villa&quot; by Spanish Royal Decree in 1778.

Coamo was the administrative center that encompassed most of the southern half of the island during the early colonial period. As the agricultural and sugar industries grew and became the mainstays of the colony&#x27;s economy, the province would eventually subdivide into several distinct municipalities, and the administrative center of the region would later shift west to the coastal town of Ponce.

Coamo is the home of a series of natural hot springs, &quot;Los Baños de Coamo&quot;, which have attracted visitors since before the Spaniards landed. These springs were once rumored to have been Juan Ponce de León&#x27;s legendary fountain of youth. In the early nineteenth century, a system of pools of varying depths, sizes and temperatures was constructed at the site of these springs to serve as a spa for the colonials. During the American invasion in the Spanish–American War (1898), this site was the scene of one of the decisive battles of that conflict (the Battle of Coamo). The American troops took possession of the island, and the spa was subsequently abandoned. Though the site lay in ruins for most of the twentieth century, it continued to be a landmark to the &quot;Coameños&quot;, who would often go to bathe in its healing thermal waters. The pools remain, but the old buildings which once hosted the island&#x27;s affluent and colonial soldiers are gone, except for the remains of one central wall structure. It has been preserved and incorporated into a fountain courtyard on the grounds of a popular tourist hotel and rest area and has replaced the ancient Spanish ruins.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Coamo was 15,144.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Coamo with the significant amount of rainfall. As of October 9, no one in Coamo had electrical service, only 15% of Coamo had access to clean drinking water, and several people on dialysis had died. Around 2,000 homes were partially or completely destroyed. The iconic was a total loss.

<text>National Day of Sweden ( ) is the National Day of Sweden, observed annually as a public holiday on 6 June. Prior to 1983, the day was celebrated only as the Swedish Flag Day (). It was officially named the Swedish National Day by the parliament of Sweden in 1983, and became a public holiday in 2005. The day is celebrated in honor of the election of Gustav Vasa as King of Sweden in 1523 and of the adoption of the constitutions of 1809 and 1974.

== History ==
The tradition of celebrating this date began in 1916 at the Stockholm Olympic Stadium, in honor of the election of King Gustav Vasa on 6 June 1523 (according to the Julian calendar), as this was considered the foundation of modern Sweden. Some question the validity of this as a national holiday, as the event occurred so long ago that it does not have a strong a presence in the social consciousness as, for example, the Norwegian Constitution Day, &quot;Syttende mai&quot;.

In 2005, it became an official Swedish public holiday, replacing Whit Monday. This change led to fewer days off from work (more working-days) as 6 June will periodically fall on the weekend, unlike Whit Monday, which was always celebrated on a Monday. Among newer traditions that have emerged since National Day turned red day is an invitation from the King to the public to visit large parts of Stockholm Palace all day without the usual entry fees.

<text>This is a list of the Maronite patriarchs of Antioch and all the East, the primate of the Maronite Church, one of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Starting with Paul Peter Massad in 1854, after becoming patriarch of the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch, they assume the name &quot;Peter&quot; (Boutros in Arabic, بطرس), after the traditional first Bishop of Antioch, St. Peter, who was also the head of the Apostles. The official title that the Maronite Patriarch assumes is &quot;Patriarch of Antioch and All the East&quot;. To this date 15 patriarchs have been canonized by the Catholic Church, with an extra two being beatified but not yet canonized.

For the Patriarchs of Antioch before John Maron, see List of Patriarchs of Antioch.

==List of Patriarchs of Antioch and all the Levant of the Maronite Church==

A famous list of Maronite Patriarchs of Antioch was written and published by Giuseppe Simone Assemani, and Simon Awad, which follows the &quot;Series of Maronite Patriachs&quot; written by Patriarch Estephan El Douaihy in the 17th century, but it is incomplete for the first centuries. Besides the Assemani&#x27;s list, another more detailed list was written in Bejjeh in 1766 by Georges Saad.

In the list here below the names shifted on the right are not included in the incomplete Assemani&#x27;s list and derive from the Bejjeh list.

<doc id="218436" wikidata="Q5539827" url="?curid=218436" title="George Goring, Lord Goring">
<text>George Goring, Lord Goring (14 July 1608 – 1657) was an English Royalist soldier. He was known by the courtesy title &quot;Lord Goring&quot; as the eldest son of the first Earl of Norwich.

== Early life ==

Goring, the eldest son of George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich, was born on 14 July 1608.

He married Lettice Boyle, the daughter of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork.

== Experience before the Civil Wars ==
His father-in-law, Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, procured for him a post in the Dutch Army with the rank of colonel. He was permanently lamed by a wound received at the Siege of Breda in 1637, and returned to England early in 1639, when he was made governor of Portsmouth.

He served in the Bishops&#x27; Wars, and already had a considerable reputation when he was involved in the &quot;Army Plot&quot; (1641). Officers of the army stationed at York proposed to petition the king and parliament for the maintenance of the royal authority. A second party was in favour of more violent measures, and Goring, in the hope of being appointed lieutenant-general, proposed to march the army on London and overawe the Parliament during Strafford&#x27;s trial (1641). This proposition being rejected by his fellow-officers, he betrayed the proceedings to Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport, who passed on the information indirectly to John Pym in April.

==Lieutenant-General of Horse==
Colonel Goring was there upon called on to give evidence before the Commons, who commended him for his services to the Commonwealth. This betrayal of his comrades induced confidence in the minds of the parliamentary leaders, who sent him back to his Portsmouth command. Nevertheless he declared for the king in August. He surrendered Portsmouth to the parliament in September 1642 after the Siege of Portsmouth and went to the Netherlands to recruit for the Royalist army, returning to England in December. Appointed to a cavalry command by the Earl of Newcastle, he defeated Fairfax at Seacroft Moor near Leeds in March 1643, but in May he was taken prisoner at Wakefield on the capture of the town by Fairfax. In April 1644 he effected an exchange.

At the Battle of Marston Moor, Goring commanded the Royalist left, and charged with great success, but, allowing his troopers to disperse in search of plunder, was routed by Oliver Cromwell at the close of the battle. In November 1644, on his father&#x27;s elevation to the earldom of Norwich, he became Lord Goring. The parliamentary authorities, however, refused to recognise the creation of the earldom, and continued to speak of the father as &quot;Lord Goring&quot; and the son as &quot;General Goring&quot;.

In August Goring had been dispatched by Prince Rupert of the Rhine, who recognised his ability, to join Charles I in the south, and in spite of his dissolute and insubordinate character he was appointed to supersede Henry, Lord Wilmot, as lieutenant-general of the Royalist horse. He secured some successes in the west, and in January 1645 advanced through Hampshire and occupied Farnham; but want of money compelled him to retreat to Salisbury and thence to Exeter. The excesses committed by his troops seriously injured the Royalist cause, and his exactions made his name hated throughout the west.

He had himself prepared to besiege Taunton in March 1645, yet when in the next month he was desired by Prince Charles, who was at Bristol, to send reinforcements to Sir Richard Grenville for the siege of Taunton, he obeyed the order only with ill-humour. Later in April 1645 he was summoned with his troops to the relief of the king at Oxford.

Lord Goring had long been intriguing for an independent command, and he now secured from the king what was practically supreme authority in the west. It was alleged by the Earl of Newport that he was willing to transfer his allegiance once more to the parliament. It is not likely that he meditated open treason, but he was culpably negligent and occupied with private ambitions and jealousies. He was still engaged in desultory operations against Taunton when the main campaign of 1645 opened.

For the part taken by Goring&#x27;s army in the operations of the Naseby campaign see First English Civil War: Naseby Campaign. After the decisive defeat of the king, the army of Fairfax marched into the west and defeated Goring in a disastrous fight at Langport on 10 July 1645. He made no further serious resistance to the parliamentary general, but wasted his time in frivolous amusements.

==Exile and command in Spain==
In November 1645 he obtained leave to quit his disorganised forces and retire to France on the ground of health. His father&#x27;s services secured him the command of some English regiments in the Spanish service. He died in Madrid after converting to Catholicism (in the care of the Jesuits) in July or August 1657.

==Character assessment==
Clarendon says of Goring that he &quot;would, without hesitation, have broken any trust, or done any act of treachery to have satisfied an ordinary passion or appetite; and in truth wanted nothing but industry (for he had wit, and courage, and understanding and ambition, uncontrolled by any fear of God or man) to have been as eminent and successful in the highest attempt of wickedness as any man in the age he lived in or before. Of all his qualifications dissimulation was his masterpiece; in which he so much excelled, that men were not ordinarily ashamed, or out of countenance, with being deceived but twice by him&quot;. 

Clarendon&#x27;s assessment, according to Goring&#x27;s biographer Florene Memegalos is untrustworthy as he appears to have blackened his name at court for personal reasons. Memegalos also asserts from archive material in the Venice State records and other sources, that Goring&#x27;s reputation stood mainly on his military abilities as a Royalist general and not just on Clarendon&#x27;s all too obvious character assassination of him.

<doc id="218445" wikidata="Q380772" url="?curid=218445" title="Lean manufacturing">
<text>Lean manufacturing is a method of manufacturing goods aimed primarily at reducing times within the production system as well as response times from suppliers and customers. It is closely related to another concept called just-in-time manufacturing (JIT manufacturing in short). Just-in-time manufacturing tries to match production to demand by only supplying goods that have been ordered and focus on efficiency, productivity (with a commitment to continuous improvement), and reduction of &quot;wastes&quot; for the producer and supplier of goods. Lean manufacturing adopts the just-in-time approach and additionally focuses on reducing cycle, flow, and throughput times by further eliminating activities that do not add any value for the customer. Lean manufacturing also involves people who work outside of the manufacturing process, such as in marketing and customer service.

Lean manufacturing(also known as agile manufacturing) is particularly related to the operational model implemented in the post-war 1950s and 1960s by the Japanese automobile company Toyota called the Toyota Production System (TPS), known in the United States as &quot;The Toyota Way&quot;. Toyota&#x27;s system was erected on the two pillars of just-in-time inventory management and automated quality control. The seven &quot;wastes&quot; ( in Japanese), first formulated by Toyota engineer Shigeo Shingo, are the waste of superfluous inventory of raw material and finished goods, the waste of overproduction (producing more than what is needed now), the waste of over-processing (processing or making parts beyond the standard expected by customer), the waste of transportation (unnecessary movement of people and goods inside the system), the waste of excess motion (mechanizing or automating before improving the method), the waste of waiting (inactive working periods due to job queues), and the waste of making defective products (reworking to fix avoidable defects in products and processes).

The term &quot;Lean&quot; was coined in 1988 by American businessman John Krafcik in his article &quot;Triumph of the Lean Production System,&quot; and defined in 1996 by American researchers James Womack and Daniel Jones to consist of five key principles: &quot;Precisely specify value by specific product, identify the value stream for each product, make value flow without interruptions, let customer pull value from the producer, and pursue perfection.&quot;

Companies employ the strategy to increase efficiency. By receiving goods only as they need them for the production process, it reduces inventory costs and wastage, and increases productivity and profit. The downside is that it requires producers to forecast demand accurately as the benefits can be nullified by minor delays in the supply chain. It may also impact negatively on workers due to added stress and inflexible conditions. A successful operation depends on a company having regular outputs, high-quality processes, and reliable suppliers.

== History ==
Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford documented their observations relating to these topics, and Shigeo Shingo and Taiichi Ohno applied their enhanced thoughts on the subject at Toyota in the late 1940s after World War II. The resulting methods were researched in the mid-20th century and dubbed &quot;Lean&quot; by John Krafcik in 1988, and then were defined in &quot;The Machine that Changed the World&quot; and further detailed by James Womack and Daniel Jones in &quot;Lean Thinking&quot; (1996).

=== Japan: the origins of Lean ===
The adoption of just-in-time manufacturing in Japan and many other early forms of Lean can be traced back directly to the US-backed Reconstruction and Occupation of Japan following WWII. During this time, an American economist, W. Edwards Deming, and an American statistician, Walter A. Shewhart, promoted some of the earliest modern manufacturing methods and management philosophies they developed in the late &#x27;30s and early &#x27;40s. The two experts were the first to apply these newly developed statistical models to improve efficiencies in many of America&#x27;s largest military manufacturers during WWII. However, Deming and Shewhart failed to convince other US manufacturers to apply these &quot;radical&quot; methods. 

After the war, Deming was assigned to participate in the Reconstruction of Japan by General Douglas MacArthur. Deming participated as a manufacturing consultant for Japan&#x27;s struggling heavy industries, which included Toyota and Mitsubishi. Unlike what they experienced in the US, Deming found the Japanese very receptive to learning and applying these new efficiency methods. Many of the manufacturing methods first introduced by Deming in Japan, and later innovated by Japanese companies, are what we now call Lean Manufacturing. Japanese manufacturers still recognize Deming for his contributions to modern Japanese efficiency practices by awarding the best manufacturers in the world the Deming Prize. In addition to Deming&#x27;s critical influence in Japan, most local companies were in a position where they needed an immediate solution to the extreme situation they were living in after World War II. American supply chain specialist Gerhard Plenert has offered four quite vague reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan&#x27;s post–World War II rebuilding (of economy, infrastructure, industry, political, and social-emotional stability): 
#Japan&#x27;s lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere.
#Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory.
#The Japanese islands lack natural resources with which to build products. 
#Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success.

Thus, the Japanese &quot;leaned out&quot; their processes. &quot;They built smaller factories ... in which the only materials housed in the factory were those on which work was currently being done. In this way, inventory levels were kept low, investment in in-process inventories was at a minimum, and the investment in purchased natural resources was quickly turned around so that additional materials were purchased.&quot; Plenert goes on to explain Toyota&#x27;s key role in developing this lean or just-in-time production methodology.

American industrialists recognized the threat of cheap offshore labor to American workers during the 1910s and explicitly stated the goal of what is now called lean manufacturing as a countermeasure. Henry Towne, past president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, wrote in the foreword to Frederick Winslow Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Shop Management&quot; (1911), &quot;We are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country, and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries. To maintain this condition, to strengthen our control of home markets, and, above all, to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations, we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processes.&quot;

Continuous production improvement and incentives for such were documented in Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Scientific Management&quot; (1911):

* &quot;... whenever a workman proposes an improvement, it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method, and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard. And whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old, it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment.&quot;
* &quot;...after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output, he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employer&#x27;s side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering [marking time, just doing what he is told] can prevent it.&quot;

Shigeo Shingo cites reading &quot;Principles of Scientific Management&quot; in 1931 and being &quot;greatly impressed to make the study and practice of scientific management his life&#x27;s work&quot;., 

Shingo and Taiichi Ohno were key to the design of Toyota&#x27;s manufacturing process. Previously a textile company, Toyota moved into building automobiles in 1934. Kiichiro Toyoda, the founder of Toyota Motor Corporation, directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacturing, with wasted resources on the repair of poor-quality castings. Toyota engaged in intense study of each stage of the process. In 1936, when Toyota won its first truck contract with the Japanese government, the processes encountered new problems, to which Toyota responded by developing Kaizen improvement teams, which into what has become the Toyota Production System (TPS), and subsequently The Toyota Way.

Levels of demand in the postwar economy of Japan were low; as a result, the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale had little application. Having visited and seen supermarkets in the United States, Ohno recognized that the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales. Given the financial situation during this period, over-production had to be avoided, and thus the notion of &quot;pull&quot; (or &quot;build-to-order&quot; rather than target-driven &quot;push&quot;) came to underpin production scheduling.

=== Evolution in the rest of the world ===
Just-in-time manufacturing was introduced in Australia in the 1950s by the British Motor Corporation (Australia) at its Victoria Park plant in Sydney, from where the idea later migrated to Toyota. News about just-in-time/Toyota production system reached other western countries from Japan in 1977 in two English-language articles: one referred to the methodology as the &quot;Ohno system&quot;, after Taiichi Ohno, who was instrumental in its development within Toyota. The other article, by Toyota authors in an international journal, provided additional details. Finally, those and other publicity were translated into implementations, beginning in 1980 and then quickly multiplying throughout industry in the United States and other developed countries. A seminal 1980 event was a conference in Detroit at Ford World Headquarters co-sponsored by the Repetitive Manufacturing Group (RMG), which had been founded 1979 within the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) to seek advances in manufacturing. The principal speaker, Fujio Cho (later, president of Toyota Motor Corp.), in explaining the Toyota system, stirred up the audience, and led to the RMG&#x27;s shifting gears from things like automation to just-in-time/Toyota production system.

At least some of audience&#x27;s stirring had to do with a perceived clash between the new just-in-time regime and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II), a computer software-based system of manufacturing planning and control which had become prominent in industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Debates in professional meetings on just-in-time vs. MRP II were followed by published articles, one of them titled, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Just-in-Time&quot;. Less confrontational was Walt Goddard&#x27;s, &quot;Kanban Versus MRP II—Which Is Best for You?&quot; in 1982. Four years later, Goddard had answered his own question with a book advocating just-in-time. Among the best known of MRP II&#x27;s advocates was George Plossl, who authored two articles questioning just-in-time&#x27;s kanban planning method and the &quot;japanning of America&quot;. But, as with Goddard, Plossl later wrote that &quot;JIT is a concept whose time has come&quot;.

Just-in-time/TPS implementations may be found in many case-study articles from the 1980s and beyond. An article in a 1984 issue of &quot;Inc&quot;. magazine relates how Omark Industries (chain saws, ammunition, log loaders, etc.) emerged as an extensive just-in-time implementer under its US home-grown name ZIPS (zero inventory production system). At Omark&#x27;s mother plant in Portland, Oregon, after the work force had received 40 hours of ZIPS training, they were &quot;turned loose&quot; and things began to happen. A first step was to &quot;arbitrarily eliminate a week&#x27;s lead time [after which] things ran smoother. &#x27;People asked that we try taking another week&#x27;s worth out.&#x27; After that, ZIPS spread throughout the plant&#x27;s operations &#x27;like an amoeba.&#x27;&quot; The article also notes that Omark&#x27;s 20 other plants were similarly engaged in ZIPS, beginning with pilot projects. For example, at one of Omark&#x27;s smaller plants making drill bits in Mesabi, Minnesota, &quot;large-size drill inventory was cut by 92%, productivity increased by 30%, scrap and rework ... dropped 20%, and lead time ... from order to finished product was slashed from three weeks to three days.&quot; The &quot;Inc&quot;. article states that companies using just-in-time the most extensively include &quot;the Big Four, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Westinghouse Electric, General Electric, Deere &amp; Company, and Black and Decker&quot;.

By 1986, a case-study book on just-in-time in the U.S. was able to devote a full chapter to ZIPS at Omark, along with two chapters on just-in-time at several Hewlett-Packard plants, and single chapters for Harley-Davidson, John Deere, IBM-Raleigh, North Carolina, and California-based Apple Inc., a Toyota truck-bed plant, and New United Motor Manufacturing joint venture between Toyota and General Motors.

Two similar, contemporaneous books from the UK are more international in scope. One of the books, with both conceptual articles and case studies, includes three sections on just-in-time practices: in Japan (e.g., at Toyota, Mazda, and Tokagawa Electric); in Europe (jmg Bostrom, Lucas Electric, Cummins Engine, IBM, 3M, Datasolve Ltd., Renault, Massey Ferguson); and in the US and Australia (Repco Manufacturing-Australia, Xerox Computer, and two on Hewlett-Packard). The second book, reporting on what was billed as the First International Conference on just-in-time manufacturing, includes case studies in three companies: Repco-Australia, IBM-UK, and 3M-UK. In addition, a day two keynote address discussed just-in-time as applied &quot;across all disciplines, ... from accounting and systems to design and production&quot;.

=== Rebranding as &quot;lean&quot; ===
John Krafcik coined the term &quot;Lean&quot; in his 1988 article, &quot;Triumph of the Lean Production System&quot;. The article states: (a) Lean manufacturing plants have higher levels of productivity/quality than non-Lean and (b) &quot;The level of plant technology seems to have little effect on operating performance&quot; (page 51). According to the article, risks with implementing Lean can be reduced by: &quot;developing a well-trained, flexible workforce, product designs that are easy to build with high quality, and a supportive, high-performance supplier network&quot; (page 51).

=== Middle era and to the present ===

Three more books which include just-in-time implementations were published in 1993, 1995, and 1996, which are start-up years of the lean manufacturing/lean management movement that was launched in 1990 with publication of the book, &quot;The Machine That Changed the World&quot;. That one, along with other books, articles, and case studies on lean, were supplanting just-in-time terminology in the 1990s and beyond. The same period, saw the rise of books and articles with similar concepts and methodologies but with alternative names, including &quot;cycle time management&quot;, &quot;time-based competition&quot;, &quot;quick-response manufacturing&quot;, flow, and &quot;pull-based production systems&quot;.

There is more to just-in-time than its usual manufacturing-centered explication. Inasmuch as manufacturing ends with order-fulfillment to distributors, retailers, and end users, and also includes remanufacturing, repair, and warranty claims, just-in-time&#x27;s concepts and methods have application downstream from manufacturing itself. A 1993 book on &quot;world-class distribution logistics&quot; discusses kanban links from factories onward, and a manufacturer-to-retailer model developed in the U.S. in the 1980s, referred to as &quot;quick response&quot;, has morphed over time to what is called &quot;fast fashion&quot;.

== Methodology ==
The strategic elements of lean can be quite complex, and comprise multiple elements. Four different notions of lean have been identified:

# Lean as a fixed state or goal (being lean)
# Lean as a continuous change process (becoming lean)
# Lean as a set of tools or methods (doing lean/toolbox lean)
# Lean as a philosophy (lean thinking)

The other way to avoid market risk and control the supply efficiently is to cut down in stock. P&amp;G has completed their goal to co-operate with Walmart and other wholesales companies by building the response system of stocks directly to the suppliers companies.

In 1999, Spear and Bowen identified four rules which characterize the &quot;Toyota DNA&quot;:

# All work shall be highly specified as to content, sequence, timing, and outcome.
# Every customer-supplier connection must be direct, and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses.
# The pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct.
# Any improvement must be made in accordance with the scientific method, under the guidance of a teacher, at the lowest possible level in the organization.

This is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies, and requires more persistence than basic application of the tools, which may partially account for its lack of popularity. The implementation of &quot;smooth flow&quot; exposes quality problems that already existed, and waste reduction then happens as a natural consequence, a system-wide perspective rather focusing directly upon the wasteful practices themselves.

Takt time is the rate at which products need to be produced to meet customer demand. The JIT system is designed to produce products at the rate of takt time, which ensures that products are produced just in time to meet customer demand.

Sepheri provides a list of methodologies of just-in-time manufacturing that &quot;are important but not exhaustive&quot;:

* Housekeeping: physical organization and discipline.
* Make it right the first time: elimination of defects.
* Setup reduction: flexible changeover approaches.
* Lot sizes of one: the ultimate lot size and flexibility.
* Uniform plant load: leveling as a control mechanism.
* Balanced flow: organizing flow scheduling throughput.
* Skill diversification: multi-functional workers.
* Control by visibility: communication media for activity.
* Preventive maintenance: flawless running, no defects.
* Fitness for use: producibility, design for process.
* Compact plant layout: product-oriented design.
* Streamlining movements: smoothing materials handling.
* Supplier networks: extensions of the factory.
* Worker involvement: small group improvement activities.
* Cellular manufacturing: production methods for flow.
* Pull system: signal [kanban] replenishment/resupply systems.

=== Key principles ===

Womack and Jones define Lean as &quot;...a way to do more and more with less and less—less human effort, less equipment, less time, and less space—while coming closer and closer to providing customers exactly what they want&quot; and then translate this into five key principles:

# Value: Specify the value desired by the customer. &quot;Form a team for each product to stick with that product during its entire production cycle&quot;, &quot;Enter into a dialogue with the customer&quot; (e.g. Voice of the customer)
# The Value Stream: Identify the value stream for each product providing that value and challenge all of the wasted steps (generally nine out of ten) currently necessary to provide it
# Flow: Make the product flow continuously through the remaining value-added steps
# Pull: Introduce pull between all steps where continuous flow is possible
# Perfection: Manage toward perfection so that the number of steps and the amount of time and information needed to serve the customer continually falls

Lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities. &quot;The value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for, everything else is waste, and should be eliminated, simplified, reduced, or integrated&quot;.

On principle 2, waste, see seven basic waste types under The Toyota Way. Additional waste types are:

* Faulty goods (manufacturing of goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications, Womack et al., 2003. See Lean services)
* Waste of skills (Six Sigma)
* Under-utilizing capabilities (Six Sigma)
* Delegating tasks with inadequate training (Six Sigma)
* Metrics (working to the wrong metrics or no metrics) (Mika Geoffrey, 1999)
* Participation (not utilizing workers by not allowing them to contribute ideas and suggestions and be part of Participative Management) (Mika Geoffrey, 1999)
* Computers (improper use of computers: not having the proper software, training on use and time spent surfing, playing games or just wasting time) (Mika Geoffrey, 1999)

=== Implementation ===
One paper suggests that an organization implementing Lean needs its own Lean plan as developed by the &quot;Lean Leadership&quot;. This should enable Lean teams to provide suggestions for their managers who then makes the actual decisions about what to implement. Coaching is recommended when an organization starts off with Lean to impart knowledge and skills to shop-floor staff. Improvement metrics are required for informed decision-making.

Lean philosophy and culture is as important as tools and methodologies. Management should not decide on solutions without understanding the true problem by consulting shop floor personnel.

The solution to a specific problem for a specific company may not have generalized application. The solution must fit the problem.

Value-stream mapping (VSM) and 5S are the most common approaches companies take on their first steps to Lean. Lean can be focused on specific processes, or cover the entire supply chain. Front-line workers should be involved in VSM activities. Implementing a series of small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity.

== Naming ==
Alternative terms for JIT manufacturing have been used. Motorola&#x27;s choice was short-cycle manufacturing (SCM). IBM&#x27;s was continuous-flow manufacturing (CFM), and demand-flow manufacturing (DFM), a term handed down from consultant John Constanza at his Institute of Technology in Colorado. Still another alternative was mentioned by Goddard, who said that &quot;Toyota Production System is often mistakenly referred to as the &#x27;Kanban System&#x27;&quot;, and pointed out that kanban is but one element of TPS, as well as JIT production.

The wide use of the term &quot;JIT manufacturing&quot; throughout the 1980s faded fast in the 1990s, as the new term &quot;lean manufacturing&quot; became established, as &quot;a more recent name for JIT&quot;. As just one testament to the commonality of the two terms, &quot;Toyota production system (TPS)&quot; has been and is widely used as a synonym for both JIT and lean manufacturing., 

== Objectives and benefits ==

Objectives and benefits of JIT manufacturing may be stated in two primary ways: first, in specific and quantitative terms, via published case studies; second, general listings and discussion.

A case-study summary from Daman Products in 1999 lists the following benefits: reduced cycle times 97%, setup times 50%, lead times from 4 to 8 weeks to 5 to 10 days, flow distance 90%. This was achieved via four focused (cellular) factories, pull scheduling, kanban, visual management, and employee empowerment.

Another study from NCR (Dundee, Scotland) in 1998, a producer of make-to-order automated teller machines, includes some of the same benefits while also focusing on JIT purchasing: In switching to JIT over a weekend in 1998, eliminated buffer inventories, reducing inventory from 47 days to 5 days, flow time from 15 days to 2 days, with 60% of purchased parts arriving JIT and 77% going dock to line, and suppliers reduced from 480 to 165.

Hewlett-Packard, one of western industry&#x27;s earliest JIT implementers, provides a set of four case studies from four H-P divisions during the mid-1980s. The four divisions, Greeley, Fort Collins, Computer Systems, and Vancouver, employed some but not all of the same measures. At the time about half of H-P&#x27;s 52 divisions had adopted JIT.

==Application outside a manufacturing context==

Lean principles have been successfully applied to various sectors and services, such as call centers and healthcare. In the former, lean&#x27;s waste reduction practices have been used to reduce handle time, within and between agent variation, accent barriers, as well as attain near perfect process adherence. In the latter, several hospitals have adopted the idea of &quot;lean hospital&quot;, a concept that prioritizes the patient, thus increasing the employee commitment and motivation, as well as boosting medical quality and cost effectiveness.

Lean principles also have applications to software development and maintenance as well as other sectors of information technology (IT). More generally, the use of lean in information technology has become known as Lean IT. Lean methods are also applicable to the public sector, but most results have been achieved using a much more restricted range of techniques than lean provides.

The challenge in moving lean to services is the lack of widely available reference implementations to allow people to see how directly applying lean manufacturing tools and practices can work and the impact it does have. This makes it more difficult to build the level of belief seen as necessary for strong implementation. However, some research does relate widely recognized examples of success in retail and even airlines to the underlying principles of lean. Despite this, it remains the case that the direct manufacturing examples of &#x27;techniques&#x27; or &#x27;tools&#x27; need to be better &#x27;translated&#x27; into a service context to support the more prominent approaches of implementation, which has not yet received the level of work or publicity that would give starting points for implementors. The upshot of this is that each implementation often &#x27;feels its way&#x27; along as must the early industrial engineering practices of Toyota. This places huge importance upon sponsorship to encourage and protect these experimental developments.

Lean management is nowadays implemented also in non-manufacturing processes and administrative processes. In non-manufacturing processes is still huge potential for optimization and efficiency increase. Some people have advocated using STEM resources to teach children Lean thinking instead of computer science.

Lean manufacturing methodology has become a prevalent practice in public healthcare, commonly known as lean healthcare. Due to the intensively competitive environment, lean approach becomes a growing alternative in the healthcare sector to achieve optimized resource management and performance improvement.

== Criticism ==
According to Williams, it becomes necessary to find suppliers that are close by or can supply materials quickly with limited advance notice. When ordering small quantities of materials, suppliers&#x27; minimum order policies may pose a problem, though.

Employees are at risk of precarious work when employed by factories that utilize just-in-time and flexible production techniques. A longitudinal study of US workers since 1970 indicates employers seeking to easily adjust their workforce in response to supply and demand conditions respond by creating more nonstandard work arrangements, such as contracting and temporary work.

Natural and human-made disasters will disrupt the flow of energy, goods and services. The down-stream customers of those goods and services will, in turn, not be able to produce their product or render their service because they were counting on incoming deliveries &quot;just in time&quot; and so have little or no inventory to work with. The disruption to the economic system will cascade to some degree depending on the nature and severity of the original disaster and may create shortages. The larger the disaster the worse the effect on just-in-time failures. Electrical power is the ultimate example of just-in-time delivery. A severe geomagnetic storm could disrupt electrical power delivery for hours to years, locally or even globally. Lack of supplies on hand to repair the electrical system would have catastrophic effects.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption in JIT practices, with various quarantine restrictions on international trade and commercial activity in general interrupting supply while lacking stockpiles to handle the disruption; along with increased demand for medical supplies like personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, and even panic buying, including of various domestically manufactured (and so less vulnerable) products like panic buying of toilet paper, disturbing regular demand. This has led to suggestions that stockpiles and diversification of suppliers should be more heavily focused.

Critics of Lean argue that this management method has significant drawbacks, especially for the employees of companies operating under Lean. Common criticism of Lean is that it fails to take into consideration the employee&#x27;s safety and well-being. Lean manufacturing is associated with an increased level of stress among employees, who have a small margin of error in their work environment which require perfection. Lean also over-focuses on cutting waste, which may lead management to cut sectors of the company that are not essential to the company&#x27;s short-term productivity but are nevertheless important to the company&#x27;s legacy. Lean also over-focuses on the present, which hinders a company&#x27;s plans for the future.

Critics also make negative comparison of Lean and 19th century scientific management, which had been fought by the labor movement and was considered obsolete by the 1930s. Finally, lean is criticized for lacking a standard methodology: &quot;Lean is more a culture than a method, and there is no standard lean production model.&quot;

After years of success of Toyota&#x27;s Lean Production, the consolidation of supply chain networks has brought Toyota to the position of being the world&#x27;s biggest carmaker in the rapid expansion. In 2010, the crisis of safety-related problems in Toyota made other carmakers that duplicated Toyota&#x27;s supply chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them.
James Womack had warned Toyota that cooperating with single outsourced suppliers might bring unexpected problems.

Lean manufacturing is different from lean enterprise. Recent research reports the existence of several lean manufacturing processes but of few lean enterprises. One distinguishing feature opposes lean accounting and standard cost accounting. For standard cost accounting, SKUs are difficult to grasp. SKUs include too much hypothesis and variance, i.e., SKUs hold too much indeterminacy. Manufacturing may want to consider moving away from traditional accounting and adopting lean accounting. In using lean accounting, one expected gain is activity-based cost visibility, i.e., measuring the direct and indirect costs at each step of an activity rather than traditional cost accounting that limits itself to labor and supplies.

<doc id="218447" wikidata="Q950981" url="?curid=218447" title="Polymorphic code">
<text>In computing, polymorphic code is code that uses a polymorphic engine to mutate while keeping the original algorithm intact - that is, the &quot;code&quot; changes itself every time it runs, but the &quot;function&quot; of the code (its semantics) stays the same. For example, the simple math expressions 3+1 and 6-2 both achieve the same result, yet run with different machine code in a CPU. This technique is sometimes used by computer viruses, shellcodes and computer worms to hide their presence.

Encryption is the most common method to hide code. With encryption, the main body of the code (also called its payload) is encrypted and will appear meaningless. For the code to function as before, a decryption function is added to the code. When the code is &quot;executed&quot;, this function reads the payload and decrypts it before executing it in turn.

Encryption alone is not polymorphism. To gain polymorphic behavior, the encryptor/decryptor pair is mutated with each copy of the code. This allows different versions of some code which all function the same.

== Malicious code ==

Most anti-virus software and intrusion detection systems (IDS) attempt to locate malicious code by searching through computer files and data packets sent over a computer network. If the security software finds patterns that correspond to known computer viruses or worms, it takes appropriate steps to neutralize the threat. Polymorphic algorithms make it difficult for such software to recognize the offending code because it constantly mutates.

Malicious programmers have sought to protect their encrypted code from this virus-scanning strategy by rewriting the unencrypted decryption engine (and the resulting encrypted payload) each time the virus or worm is propagated. Anti-virus software uses sophisticated pattern analysis to find underlying patterns within the different mutations of the decryption engine, in hopes of reliably detecting such malware.

Emulation may be used to defeat polymorphic obfuscation by letting the malware demangle itself in a virtual environment before utilizing other methods, such as traditional signature scanning. Such a virtual environment is sometimes called a sandbox. Polymorphism does not protect the virus against such emulation if the decrypted payload remains the same regardless of variation in the decryption algorithm. Metamorphic code techniques may be used to complicate detection further, as the virus may execute without ever having identifiable code blocks in memory that remains constant from infection to infection.

The first known polymorphic virus was written by Mark Washburn. The virus, called 1260, was written in 1990. A better-known polymorphic virus was created in 1992 by the hacker Dark Avenger as a means of avoiding pattern recognition from antivirus software. A common and very virulent polymorphic virus is the file infecter Virut.

<doc id="218449" wikidata="Q844924" url="?curid=218449" title="Illegal drug trade">
<text>The illegal drug trade, drug trafficking, or narcotrafficking is a global black market dedicated to the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of prohibited drugs. Most jurisdictions prohibit trade, except under license, of many types of drugs through the use of drug prohibition laws. The think tank Global Financial Integrity&#x27;s &quot;Transnational Crime and the Developing World&quot; report estimates the size of the global illicit drug market between US$426 and US$652 billion in 2014 that is equal to the UK&#x27;s national debt alone. With a world GDP of US$78 trillion in the same year, the illegal drug trade may be estimated as nearly 1% of total global trade. Consumption of illegal drugs is widespread globally, and it remains very difficult for local authorities to reduce the rates of drug consumption.

==History==
The government of the Qing dynasty issued edicts against opium smoking in 1730, 1796 and 1800. The West prohibited addictive drugs throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Beginning in the 18th century, British merchants from the East India Company began to illegally sell opium to Chinese merchants, and by the early 19th century, an illegal drug trade in China emerged. As a result, by 1838, the number of Chinese opium-addicts had grown to between four and twelve million. The Chinese government responded by enforcing a ban on the import of opium; this led to the First Opium War (1839–1842) between the United Kingdom and Qing-dynasty China. The British defeated the Chinese, and in the resulting treaty that ended the war, the Treaty of Nanking, the Qing government was forced to allow British merchants to sell Indian-grown opium. Trading in opium was lucrative, and smoking it had become common for the Chinese in the 19th century, so British merchants increased trade with the Chinese. The Second Opium War broke out in 1856, with the British joined this time by the French. The Treaty of Tianjin, which concluded that conflict, stipulated that the Chinese authorities would open further ports to foreign trade, including opium.

In 1868, as a result of the increased use of opium in Britain, the British government restricted the sale of opium by implementing the 1868 Pharmacy Act. In the United States, control of opium remained under the control of individual US states until the introduction of the Harrison Act in 1914, after 12 international powers signed the International Opium Convention in 1912.

Between 1920 and , the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution banned alcohol in the United States. Prohibition proved almost impossible to enforce and resulted in the rise of organized crime, including the modern American Mafia, which identified enormous business opportunities in the manufacturing, smuggling and sale of illicit liquor.

The beginning of the 21st century saw drug use increase in North America and Europe, with a particularly increased demand for marijuana and cocaine. As a result, international organized crime syndicates such as the Sinaloa Cartel and &#x27;Ndrangheta have increased cooperation among each other in order to facilitate trans-Atlantic drug-trafficking. Use of another illicit drug, hashish, has also increased in Europe.

Drug trafficking is widely regarded by lawmakers as a serious offense around the world. Penalties often depend on the type of drug (and its classification in the country into which it is being trafficked), the quantity trafficked, where the drugs are sold and how they are distributed. If the drugs are sold to underage people, then the penalties for trafficking may be harsher than in other circumstances.

Drug smuggling carries severe penalties in many countries. Sentencing may include lengthy periods of incarceration, flogging and even the death penalty (in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and elsewhere). In December 2005, Van Tuong Nguyen, a 25-year-old Australian drug smuggler, was hanged in Singapore after being convicted in March 2004. In 2010, two people were sentenced to death in Malaysia for trafficking of cannabis into the country. Execution is mostly used as a deterrent, and many have called upon much more effective measures to be taken by countries to tackle drug trafficking; for example, targeting specific criminal organisations that are often also active in the smuggling of other goods (i.e. wildlife) and even people. In many cases, links between politicians and the criminal organisations have been proven to exist.

In June 2021, Interpol revealed an operation in 92 countries that shut down 113,000 websites and online marketplaces selling counterfeit or illicit medicines and medical products a month earlier, led to the arrests of 227 people worldwide, recovered pharmaceutical products worth $23 million, and led to the seizure of approximately nine million devices and drugs, including large quantities of fake COVID-19 tests and face masks.

==Societal effects==
The countries of drug production and transit are some of the most affected by the trade, though countries receiving the illegallyimported substances are also adversely affected. For example, Ecuador has absorbed up to 300,000 refugees from Colombia who are running from guerrillas, paramilitaries and drug lords. While some applied for asylum, others are still illegal immigrants. The drugs that pass from Colombia through Ecuador to other parts of South America create economic and social problems.

Honduras, through which an estimated 79% of cocaine passes on its way to the United States, had, as of 2011, the highest murder rate in the world. According to the International Crisis Group, the most violent regions in Central America, particularly along the Guatemala–Honduras border, are highly correlated with an abundance of drug trafficking activity.

===Violent crime===
In several countries, the illegal drug trade is thought to be directly linked to violent crimes such as murder and gun violence. This is especially true in all developing
countries, such as Honduras, but is also an issue for many developed countries worldwide. In the late 1990s in the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated that 5% of murders were drug-related. In Colombia, drug violence can be caused by factors such as the economy, poor governments, and no authority within law enforcement.

After a crackdown by US and Mexican authorities in the first decade of the 21st century as part of tightened border security in the wake of the September 11 attacks, border violence inside Mexico surged. The Mexican government estimated that 90% of the killings were drug-related.

A report by the UK government&#x27;s Drug Strategy Unit that was leaked to the press, stated that due to the expensive price of highly addictive drugs heroin and cocaine, drug use was responsible for the great majority of crime, including 85% of shoplifting, 70–80% of burglaries and 54% of robberies. It concluded &quot;[t]he cost of crime committed to support illegal cocaine and heroin habits amounts to £16 billion a year in the UK&quot;

==Drug trafficking routes==

===Africa===

====East and South====
Heroin is increasingly trafficked from Afghanistan to Europe and America through eastern and southern African countries. This path is known as the &quot;southern route&quot; or &quot;smack track&quot;. Repercussions of this trade include burgeoning heroin use and political corruption among intermediary African nations.

====West====

Cocaine produced in Colombia and Bolivia has increasingly been shipped via West Africa (especially in Nigeria, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Mali, Benin, Togo, and Ghana). The money is often laundered in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal.

According to the Africa Economic Institute, the value of illicit drug smuggling in Guinea-Bissau is almost twice the value of the country&#x27;s GDP. Police officers are often bribed. A police officer&#x27;s normal monthly wage of $ is less than 2% of the value of of cocaine (€7000 or $). The money can also be laundered using real estate. A house is built using illegal funds, and when the house is sold, legal money is earned. When drugs are sent over land, through the Sahara, the drug traders have been forced to cooperate with terrorist organizations, such as Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb.

===Asia===
Drugs in Asia traditionally traveled the southern routesthe main caravan axes of Southeast Asia and Southern Chinaand include the former opium-producing countries of Thailand, Iran, and Pakistan. After the 1990s, particularly after the end of the Cold War (1991), borders were opened and trading and customs agreements were signed so that the routes expanded to include China, Central Asia, and Russia. There are, therefore, diversified drug trafficking routes available today, particularly in the heroin trade and these thrive due to the continuous development of new markets. A large amount of drugs are smuggled into Europe from Asia. The main sources of these drugs are Afghanistan, along with countries that constituted the so-called Golden Crescent. From these producers, drugs are smuggled into the West and Central Asia to its destinations in Europe and the United States. Iran is now a common route for smugglers, having been previously a primary trading route, due to its large-scale and costly war against drug trafficking. The Border Police Chief of Iran said that his country &quot;is a strong barrier against the trafficking of illegal drugs to Caucasus, especially the Republic of Azerbaijan.&quot; The drugs produced by the Golden Triangle of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, on the other hand, pass through the southern routes to feed the Australian, US, and Asian markets.

=== South America ===


Venezuela has been a path to the United States and Europe for illegal drugs originating in Colombia, through Central America, Mexico and Caribbean countries such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.

According to the United Nations, cocaine trafficking through Venezuela increased from 2002 to 2008. In 2005, the government of Hugo Chávez severed ties with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), accusing its representatives of spying. Following the departure of the DEA from Venezuela and the expansion of DEA&#x27;s partnership with Colombia in 2005, Venezuela became more attractive to drug traffickers. Between 2008 and 2012, Venezuela&#x27;s cocaine seizure ranking among other countries declined, going from being ranked fourth in the world for cocaine seizures in 2008 to sixth in the world in 2012.

On 18 November 2016, following what was known as the Narcosobrinos incident, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro&#x27;s two nephews were found guilty of trying to ship drugs into the United States so they could &quot;obtain a large amount of cash to help their family stay in power&quot;.

According to a research conducted by the Israel-based Abba Eban Institute as part of an initiative called Janus Initiative, the main routes that Hezbollah uses for smuggling drugs are from Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil into West Africa and then transported through northern Africa into Europe. This route serves Hezbollah in making a profit in the cocaine smuggling market in order to leverage it for their activities.

==Online trafficking==
Drugs are increasingly traded online on the dark web on darknet markets. Internet-based drug trafficking is the global distribution of narcotics, making extensive use of technology. Similarly, the use of the Internet for the illegal trafficking of two controlled categories of drugs can also be identified as Internet-related drug trafficking. The platform Silk Road provided goods and services to 100,000 buyers before being shut down in October 2013. This prompted the creation of new platforms such as Silk Road 2.0, which were also shut down.

==Profits==

Statistics about profits from the drug trade are largely unknown due to its illicit nature. An online report published by the UK Home Office in 2007 estimated the illicit drug market in the UK at £4–6.6 billion a year.

In December 2009, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa claimed illegal drug money saved the banking industry from collapse. He claimed he had seen evidence that the proceeds of organized crime were &quot;the only liquid investment capital&quot; available to some banks on the brink of collapse during 2008. He said that a majority of the $352 billion (£216bn) of drug profits was absorbed into the economic system as a result: &quot;In many instances, the money from drugs was the only liquid investment capital. In the second half of 2008, liquidity was the banking system&#x27;s main problem and hence liquid capital became an important factor ... Inter-bank loans were funded by money that originated from the trade and other illegal activities...there were signs that some banks were rescued that way&quot;.

Costa declined to identify countries or banks that may have received any drug money, saying that would be inappropriate because his office is supposed to address the problem, not apportion blame.

Though street-level drug sales are widely viewed as lucrative, a study by Sudhir Venkatesh suggested that many low-level employees receive low wages. In a study he made in the 1990s working closely with members of the Black Gangster Disciple Nation in Chicago, he found that one gang (essentially a franchise) consisted of a leader (a college graduate named J.T.), three senior officers, and 25 to 75 street level salesmen (&#x27;foot soldiers&#x27;) depending on season. Selling crack cocaine, they took in approximately $32,000 per month over a six-year period. This was spent as follows: $5,000 to the board of twenty directors of the Black Gangster Disciple Nation, who oversaw 100 such gangs for approximately $500,000 in monthly income. Another $5,000 monthly was paid for cocaine, and $4,000 for other non-wage expenses. J.T. took $8,500 monthly for his own salary. The remaining $9,500 monthly went to pay the employees a $7 per hour wage for officers and a $3.30 per hour wage for foot soldiers. Contrary to a popular image of drug sales as a lucrative profession, many of the employees were living with their mothers by necessity. Despite this, the gang had four times as many unpaid members who dreamed of becoming foot soldiers.

==Impact of free trade==
There are several arguments on whether or not free trade has a correlation to an increased activity in the illicit drug trade. Currently, the structure and operation of the illicit drug industry is described mainly in terms of an international division of labor. Free trade can open new markets to domestic producers who would otherwise resort to exporting illicit drugs. Additionally, extensive free trade among states increases cross-border drug enforcement and coordination between law enforcement agencies in different countries. However, free trade also increases the sheer volume of legal cross-border trade and provides cover for drug smuggling—by providing ample opportunity to conceal illicit cargo in legal trade. While international free trade continues to expand the volume of legal trade, the ability to detect and interdict drug trafficking is severely diminished. Towards the late 1990s, the top ten seaports in the world processed 33.6 million containers. Free trade has fostered integration of financial markets and has provided drug traffickers with more opportunities to launder money and invest in other activities. This strengthens the drug industry while weakening the efforts of law enforcement to monitor the flow of drug money into the legitimate economy. Cooperation among cartels expands their scope to distant markets and strengthens their abilities to evade detection by local law enforcement. Additionally, criminal organizations work together to coordinate money-laundering activities by having separate organizations handle specific stages of laundering process. One organization structures the process of how financial transactions will be laundered, while another criminal group provides the &quot;dirty&quot; money to be cleaned. By fostering expansion of trade and global transportation networks, free trade encourages cooperation and formation of alliances among criminal organizations across different countries.
The drug trade in Latin America emerged in the early 1930s. It saw significant growth in the Andean countries, including Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. The underground market in the early half of the 20th century mainly had ties to Europe. After World War II, the Andean countries saw an expansion of trade, specifically with cocaine.

==Drug trafficking by country==
===Syria===
The Ba&#x27;athist government of Syria ruled by the Al-Assad family is known for its extensive involvement in drug trade since the 1970s. As of 2022, the Syrian government financed the biggest multi-billion dollar drug trade in the world, mostly focused on an illegal drug known as Captagon, making it the world&#x27;s largest narco-state. Its revenues from Captagon smuggling alone is estimated to worth 57 billion dollars annually in 2022, which is approximately thrice the total trade of all Mexican cartels. General Maher al-Assad, younger brother of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and commander of the Fourth Armoured Division, directly supervised the production, smuggling and profiteering of the drug business. Already suffering from severe financial problems as a result of corruption and civil war, profits from Captagon are said to be the &quot;lifeline&quot; of the Assad regime, through which it earned more than 90% of its total revenue. The smugglers receive direct training from Syrian military to successfully conduct trafficking operations.

Republican Guard, commanded by Maher al-Assad was one of the main Ba&#x27;athist military divisions that was engaged in perpetrating brutal crackdowns and mass violence against protestors across the country. In 2018, Bashar al-Assad assigned Maher as the commander of the 4th Armoured Division, a military unit that supervised the Assad regime&#x27;s criminal enterprises like smuggling, drug trafficking, narcotics production and plunder of goods and resources. Under Maher&#x27;s supervision, the 4th Armoured Division expanded captagon production and trafficking from Syria into a &quot;business model controlled by the regime&quot;.

In 2022, 90% of all captagon pills manufactured in Syria exported by drug cartels affiliated with Assad regime arrived at its customer destinations across the world. Although hundreds of millions of pills were intercepted and seized by police forces, these accounted only for 10% of the total captagon exports of the drug cartels linked to the Assad regime. In 2020, Italian police seized 84 million captagon pills originating from Syrian ports while intercepting a single shipment. In June 2023, US State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs published a detailed report to the US Congress, elucidating a strategy to eliminate the narcotics production, drug trafficking and drug cartel networks affiliated with the Assad regime and Hezbollah.

A joint investigation conducted by Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and BBC News Arabic published a documentary in June 2023, revealing further details about the activities of regime officials, Ba&#x27;athist military commanders and Assad family members in their involvement in Syria&#x27;s drug cartel. The investigation found that Lebanese criminal and drug kingpin Hassan Daqou collaborated with Syria&#x27;s Fourth Armoured Division on trafficiking billions of dollars of drugs, under the command of General Ghassan Bilal, the right-hand man of Maher al-Assad. The report also unearthed Hezbollah&#x27;s close participation in the drug production and smuggling networks. The Fourth Armoured Division, being an elite military unit permitted to move freely across Assad regime&#x27;s checkpoints, oversees the smuggling operations from Syria, including the trafficking of cash, weapons, illegal drugs, etc. Days after the publication of the joint BBC-OCCRP documentary; Assad government banned all activities of BBC media outlets and entry of affiliated media personnel in Syria.

The extensive involvement of Syrian Armed Forces in sponsorship of drug production and trade has led to pervasive drug addiction problems amongst pro-Assad soldiers. In many instances, military officials encourage the soldiers to consume Captagon and other illegal drugs, leading to overdose or drug abuse. Pro-Assad fighters in the National Defence Forces and Hezbollah also consume illegal drugs in large quantities. In July 2023, German police busted a major captagon network run by two Syrian-born men in southern German state of Bavaria. Assad regime sponsors the largest Captagon production network in Syria; which is the source of about 80% of total captagon supply in the world.

In an investigative report published by &quot;The Insider&quot; news-outlet in 2024, journalist Yuriy Matsarsky stated:&quot;...Captagon produced in underground labs—and in actual Syrian pharmaceutical facilities—is distributed to the fighters of Bashar Assad&#x27;s army. Interestingly, however, the quantities the country produces far exceed its own military’s demand. ... By some estimates, this business gives Syria more money than its entire legal export, and the regime constantly works to increase its profits, primarily by expanding its market reach. To this end, criminal gangs associated with Damascus or Hezbollah have built distribution networks for Captagon in countries where the drug was not previously popular.&quot;

===United States===

====Background====
The effects of the illegal drug trade in the United States can be seen in a range of political, economic and social aspects. Increasing drug related violence can be tied to the racial tension that arose during the late 20th century along with the political upheaval prevalent throughout the 1960s and 70s. The second half of the 20th century was a period when increased wealth, and increased discretionary spending, increased the demand for illicit drugs in certain areas of the United States. Large-scale drug trafficking is one of the capital crimes, and may result in a death sentence prescribed at the federal level when it involves murder.

====Political impact====
A large generation, the baby boomers, came of age in the 1960s. Their social tendency to confront the law on specific issues, including illegal drugs, overwhelmed the understaffed judicial system. The federal government attempted to enforce the law, but with meager effect.

Marijuana was a popular drug seen through the Latin American trade route in the 1960s. Cocaine became a major drug product in the later decades. Much of the cocaine is smuggled from Colombia and Mexico via Jamaica. This led to several administrations combating the popularity of these drugs. Due to the influence of this development on the US economy, the Reagan administration began &quot;certifying&quot; countries for their attempts at controlling drug trafficking. This allowed the United States to intervene in activities related to illegal drug transport in Latin America. Continuing into the 1980s, the United States instated stricter policy pertaining to drug transit through sea. As a result, there was an influx in drug-trafficking across the Mexico–US border, which increased the drug cartel activity in Mexico.

By the early 1990s, so much as 50% of the cocaine available in the United States market originated from Mexico, and by the 2000s, over 90% of the cocaine in the United States was imported from Mexico. In Colombia, however, there was a fall of the major drug cartels in the mid-1990s. Visible shifts occurred in the drug market in the United States. Between 1996 and 2000, US cocaine consumption dropped by 11%.

In 2008, the US government initiated another program, known as the Merida Initiative, to help combat drug trafficking in Mexico. This program increased US security assistance to $1.4 billion over several years, which helped supply Mexican forces with &quot;high-end equipment from helicopters to surveillance technology&quot;. Despite US aid, Mexican &quot;narcogangs&quot; continue to outnumber and outgun the Mexican Army, allowing for continued activities of drug cartels across the US–Mexico border.

====Social impacts====
Although narcotics are illegal in the US, they have become integrated into the nation&#x27;s culture and are seen as a recreational activity by sections of the population. Illicit drugs are considered to be a commodity with strong demand, as they are typically sold at a high value. This high price is caused by a combination of factors that include the potential legal ramifications that exist for suppliers of illicit drugs and their high demand. Despite the constant effort by politicians to win the war on drugs, the US is still the world&#x27;s largest importer of illegal drugs.

Throughout the 20th century, narcotics other than cocaine also crossed the Mexican border, meeting the US demand for alcohol during the 1920s Prohibition, opiates in the 1940s, marijuana in the 1960s, and heroin in the 1970s. Most of the US imports of drugs come from Mexican drug cartels. In the United States, around 195 cities have been infiltrated by drug trafficking that originated in Mexico. An estimated $10bn of the Mexican drug cartel&#x27;s profits come from the United States, not only supplying the Mexican drug cartels with the profit necessary for survival, but also furthering America&#x27;s economic dependence on drugs.

=====Demographics=====
With a large wave of immigrants in the 1960s and onwards, the United States saw an increased heterogeneity in its public. In the 1980s and 1990s, drug-related homicide was at a record high. This increase in drug violence became increasingly tied to these ethnic minorities. Though the rate of violence varied tremendously among cities in America, it was a common anxiety in communities across urban America. An example of this could be seen in Miami, a city with a host of ethnic enclaves. Between 1985 and 1995, the homicide rate in Miami was one of the highest in the nation—four times the national homicide average. This crime rate was correlated with regions with low employment and was not entirely dependent on ethnicity.

The baby boomer generation also felt the effects of the drug trade in their increased drug use from the 1960s to 1980s. Along with substance use, criminal involvement, suicide and murder were also on the rise. Due to the large amount of baby boomers, commercial marijuana use was on the rise. This increased the supply and demand for marijuana during this time period.

===Mexico===
====Political influences====
Corruption in Mexico has contributed to the domination of Mexican cartels in the illicit drug trade. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Mexico&#x27;s political environment allowed the growth of drug-related activity. The loose regulation over the transportation of illegal drugs and the failure to prosecute known drug traffickers and gangs increased the growth of the drug industry. Toleration of drug trafficking has undermined the authority of the Mexican government and has decreased the power of law enforcement officers in regulation over such activities. These policies of tolerance fostered the growing power of drug cartels in the Mexican economy and have made drug traders wealthier. Many states in Mexico lack policies that establish stability in governance. There also is a lack of local stability, as mayors cannot be re-elected. This requires electing a new mayor each term. Drug gangs have manipulated this, using vacuums in local leadership to their own advantage.
In 1929, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) was formed to resolve the chaos resulting from the Mexican Revolution. Over time, this party gained political influence and had a major impact on Mexico&#x27;s social and economic policies. The party created ties with various groups as a power play in order to gain influence, and as a result created more corruption in the government. One such power play was an alliance with drug traffickers. This political corruption obscured justice, making it difficult to identify violence when it related to drugs. By the 1940s, the tie between the drug cartels and the PRI had solidified. This arrangement created immunity for the leaders of the drug cartels and allowed drug trafficking to grow under the protection of the government officials.

During the 1990s, the PRI lost some elections to the new National Action Party (PAN). Chaos again emerged as elected government in Mexico changed drastically. As the PAN party took control, drug cartel leaders took advantage of the ensuing confusion and used their existing influence to further gain power. Instead of negotiating with the central government as was done with the PRI party, drug cartels utilized new ways to distribute their supply and continued operating through force and intimidation. As Mexico became more democratized, the corruption fell from a centralized power to the local authorities. Cartels began to bribe local authorities, thus eliminating the structure and rules placed by the government—giving cartels more freedom. As a response, Mexico saw an increase in violence caused by drug trafficking.

The corruption cartels created resulted in distrust of government by the Mexican public. This distrust became more prominent after the collapse of the PRI party. In response, the presidents of Mexico, in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century, implemented several different programs relating to law enforcement and regulation. In 1993, President Salinas created the National Institute for the Combat of Drugs in Mexico. From 1995 to 1998, President Zedillo established policies regarding increased punishment of organized crime, allowing &quot;[wire taps], protected witnesses, covert agents and seizures of goods&quot;, and increasing the quality of law enforcement at the federal level. From 2001 to 2005, President Vicente Fox created the Federal Agency of Investigation.
These policies resulted in the arrests of major drug-trafficking bosses:
====Mexico&#x27;s economy====
Over the past few decades, drug cartels have become integrated into Mexico&#x27;s economy. Approximately 500 cities are directly engaged in drug trafficking and nearly 450,000 people are employed by drug cartels. Additionally, the livelihood of 3.2 million people is dependent on the drug cartels. Between local and international sales, such as to Europe and the United States, drug cartels in Mexico see a $25–30 bn yearly profit, a great deal of which circulates through international banks such as HSBC. Drug cartels are fundamental in local economics. A percentage of the profits seen from the trade are invested in the local community. Such profits contribute to the education and healthcare of the community. While these cartels bring violence and hazards into communities, they create jobs and provide income for its many members.

====Culture of drug cartels====
Major cartels saw growth due to a prominent set culture of Mexican society that created the means for drug capital. One of the sites of origin for drug trafficking within Mexico, was the state of Michoacán. In the past, Michoacán was mainly an agricultural society. This provided an initial growth of trade. Industrialization of rural areas of Mexico facilitated a greater distribution of drugs, expanding the drug market into different provinces. Once towns became industrialized, cartels such as the Sinaloa Cartel started to form and expand. The proliferation of drug cartel culture largely stemmed from the ranchero culture seen in Michoacán. Ranchero culture values the individual as opposed to the society as a whole. This culture fostered the drug culture of valuing the family that is formed within the cartel. This ideal allowed for greater organization within the cartels.

Gangs play a major role in the activity of drug cartels. MS-13 and the 18th Street gang are notorious for their contributions and influence over drug trafficking throughout Latin America. MS-13 has controlled much of the activity in the drug trade spanning from Mexico to Panama. Female involvement is present in the Mexican drug culture. Although females are not treated as equals to males, they typically hold more power than their culture allows and acquire some independence. The increase in power has attracted females from higher social classes. Financial gain has also prompted women to become involved in the illegal drug market. Many women in the lower levels of major drug cartels belong to a low economic class. Drug trafficking offers women an accessible way to earn income. Females from all social classes have become involved in the trade due to outside pressure from their social and economic environments.

===Colombia===

====Political ties====
It was common for smugglers in Colombia to import liquor, alcohol, cigarettes and textiles, while exporting cocaine. Personnel with knowledge of the terrain were able to supply the local market while also exporting a large amount of product. The established trade initially involved Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela and Cuba. Peasant farmers produced coca paste in Peru and Bolivia, while Colombian smugglers would process the coca paste into cocaine in Colombia, and trafficked product through Batista&#x27;s Cuba. This trade route established ties between Cuban and Colombian organized crime.

From Cuba, cocaine would be transported to Miami, Florida; and Union City, New Jersey. Quantities of the drug were then smuggled throughout the US. The international drug trade created political ties between the involved countries, encouraging the governments of the countries involved to collaborate and instate common policies to eradicate drug cartels. Cuba stopped being a center for transport of cocaine following the Cuban Revolution and the establishment of Fidel Castro&#x27;s communist government in 1959.

As a result, Miami and Union City became the sole locations for trafficking. The relations between Cuban and Colombian organized crime remained strong until the 1970s, when Colombian cartels began to vie for power. In the 1980s and 90s, Colombia emerged as a key contributor of the drug trade industry in the Western Hemisphere. While the smuggling of drugs such as marijuana, poppy, opium and heroin became more ubiquitous during this time period, the activity of cocaine cartels drove the development of the Latin American drug trade. The trade emerged as a multinational effort as supplies (i.e. coca plant substances) were imported from countries such as Bolivia and Peru, were refined in Colombian cocaine labs and smuggled through Colombia, and exported to countries such as the US.

====Colombia&#x27;s economy====
Colombia has had a significant role in the illegal drug trade in Latin America. While active in the drug trade since the 1930s, Colombia&#x27;s role in the drug trade did not truly become dominant until the 1970s. When Mexico eradicated marijuana plantations, demand stayed the same. Colombia met much of the demand by growing more marijuana. Grown in the strategic northeast region of Colombia, marijuana soon became the leading cash crop in Colombia. This success was short-lived due to anti-marijuana campaigns that were enforced by the US military throughout the Caribbean. Instead, drug traffickers in Colombia continued their focus on exporting cocaine.

Having been an export of Colombia since the early 1950s, cocaine remained popular for a host of reasons. Colombia&#x27;s location facilitated its transportation from South America into Central America, and then to its destination of North America. This continued into the 1990s, when Colombia remained the chief exporter of cocaine. The business of drug trafficking can be seen in several stages in Colombia towards the latter half of the 20th century. Colombia served as the dominant force in the distribution and sale of cocaine by the 1980s. As drug producers gained more power, they became more centralized and organized into what became drug cartels.

Cartels controlled the major aspects of each stage in the traffic of their product. Their organization allowed cocaine to be distributed in great amounts throughout the United States. By the late 1980s, intra-industry strife arose within the cartels. This stage was marked by increased violence as different cartels fought for control of export markets. Despite this strife, this power struggle led to then having multiple producers of coca leaf farms. This in turn caused an improvement in quality control and reduction of police interdiction in the distribution of cocaine. This also led to cartels attempting to repatriate their earnings which would eventually make up 5.5% of Colombia&#x27;s GDP. This drive to repatriate earnings led to the pressure of legitimizing their wealth, causing an increase in violence throughout Colombia.
Throughout the 1980s, estimates of illegal drug value in Colombia ranged from $2bn to $4bn. This made up about 7–10% of the $36bn estimated GNP of Colombia during this decade. In the 1990s, the estimates of the illegal drug value remained roughly within the same range (~$2.5bn). As the Colombian GNP rose throughout the 1990s ($68.5bn in 1994 and $96.3bn in 1997), illegal drug values began to comprise a decreasing fraction of the national economy.
By the early 1990s, although Colombia led in the exportation of cocaine, it found increasing confrontations within its state. These confrontations were primarily between cartels and government institutions. This led to a decrease in the drug trade&#x27;s contribution to the GDP of Colombia; dropping from 5.5% to 2.6%. Though a contributor of wealth, the distribution of cocaine has had negative effects on the socio-political situation of Colombia and has weakened its economy as well.

====Social impacts====
By the 1980s, Colombian cartels became the dominant cocaine distributors in the US. This led to the spread of increased violence throughout both Latin America and Miami. In the 1980s, two major drug cartels emerged in Colombia: the Medellín and Cali groups.

Throughout the 1990s however, several factors led to the decline of these major cartels and to the rise of smaller Colombian cartels. The US demand for cocaine dropped while Colombian production rose, pressuring traffickers to find new drugs and markets. In this time period, there was an increase in activity of Caribbean cartels that led to the rise of an alternate route of smuggling through Mexico. This led to the increased collaboration between major Colombian and Mexican drug traffickers. Such drastic changes in the execution of drug trade in Colombia paired with the political instabilities and rise of drug wars in Medellin and Cali, gave way for the rise of the smaller Colombian drug trafficking organizations (and the rise of heroin trade). As the drug trade&#x27;s influence over the economy increased, drug lords and their networks grew in their power and influence in society. The occurrences in drug-related violence increased during this time period as drug lords fought to maintain their control in the economy.

Typically, a drug cartel had support networks that consisted of a number of individuals. These people individuals ranged from those directly involved in the trade (such as suppliers, chemists, transporters, smugglers, etc.) as well as those involved indirectly in the trade (such as politicians, bankers, police, etc.). As these smaller Colombian drug cartels grew in prevalence, several notable aspects of the Colombian society gave way for further development of the Colombian drug industry. For example, until the late 1980s, the long-term effects of the drug industry were not realized by much of society. Additionally, there was a lack of regulation in prisons where captured traffickers were sent. These prisons were under-regulated, under-funded, and under-staffed, which allowed for the formation of prison gangs, for the smuggling of arms/weapons/etc., for feasible escapes, and even for captured drug lords to continue running their businesses from prison.

===Western Balkans===
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the global drug trade network witnessed the emergence of criminal groups from the Western Balkans as crucial players. These groups have moved up from being small-time crooks to major drug distributors. Most of these organized crime groups belonged to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. The illicit trade activities of the Balkans primarily involved Latin America, Western Europe, South Africa, Australia and Turkey. These groups keep their operations outside the Western Balkans, while staying connected to their homeland. Within the network of these groups, the dealmakers operate in a proximity of supply sources and the distribution networks are managed by foot soldiers. However, the bosses of the organized criminal groups stay and keep their wealth in the United Arab Emirates. The UAE is amongst the enablers of global corruption and illicit financial flows. Analysts have claimed that criminal actors across the world either operate from or through the Emirates. It was a haven for criminals, where the risk for illicit activities remains low.

For the Balkan criminals, a growing trend was to relocate to the UAE, which became an attraction to dirty money and kingpins from several European nations and the United Kingdom. Besides, Dubai was also dubbed as the &quot;new Costa del Crime&quot;, replacing the crime hideaway of Spain, the Costa del Sol. The UAE had poor regulations for money laundering and for screening of suspicious transactions. The lack of regulations against illicit financial activities prompted the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to place the Gulf country on its grey list in March 2022. Consequently, the Emirates&#x27; remained a safe option for the criminals. Nearly two-thirds of the Albanian criminal groups, who were active in trade of drugs like cocaine, were believed to be hiding in the UAE. One of such individuals, Eldi Dizdari was accused of international drug trafficking and was living in Dubai. Research revealed that these criminals invested huge amounts in the Emirates&#x27; real estate and other economical sectors to live there. Another trafficker of cocaine from Bosnia, Edin Gačanin was living in the UAE using his extensive profits to buy property and protection in the country. Dubbed as the &quot;European Escobar&quot;, he connected the supply network between production markets of Latin America and consumer markets of Western European. He was able to evade the arrest and investigations, including by the US Drug Enforcement Administration, by seeking shelter in the Emirates.

==Trade in specific drugs==
===Cannabis===


While the recreational use of (and consequently the distribution of) cannabis is illegal in most countries throughout the world, recreational distribution is legal in some countries, such as Canada, and medical distribution is permitted in some places, such as 38 of the 50 US states (although importation and distribution is still federally prohibited). Beginning in 2014, Uruguay became the first country to legalize cultivation, sale, and consumption of cannabis for recreational use for adult residents. In 2018, Canada became the second country to legalize use, sale and cultivation of cannabis. The first few weeks were met with extremely high demand, most shops being out of stock after operating for only four days.

Cannabis use is tolerated in some areas, most notably the Netherlands, which has legalized the possession and licensed sale (but not cultivation) of the drug. Many nations have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Due to the hardy nature of the cannabis plant, marijuana is grown all across the world; today, it is the world&#x27;s most popular illegal drug with the highest level of availability. Cannabis is grown legally in many countries for industrial, non-drug use (known as hemp) as well. Cannabis-hemp may also be planted for other non-drug domestic purposes, such as seasoning that occurs in Aceh.

The demand for cannabis around the world, coupled with the drug&#x27;s relative ease of cultivation, makes the illicit cannabis trade one of the primary ways in which organized criminal groups finance many of their activities. In Mexico, for example, the illicit trafficking of cannabis is thought to constitute the majority of many of the cartels&#x27; earnings, and the main way in which the cartels finance many other illegal activities; including the purchase of other illegal drugs for trafficking, and for acquiring weapons that are ultimately used to commit murders (causing a burgeoning in the homicide rates of many areas of the world, but particularly Latin America).

Some studies show that the increased legalization of cannabis in the United States (beginning in 2012 with Washington Initiative 502 and Colorado Amendment 64) has led Mexican cartels to smuggle less cannabis in exchange for more heroin.

===Alcohol===
Alcohol, in the context of alcoholic beverages rather than denatured alcohol, is illegal in a number of Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia; this has resulted in a thriving illegal trade in alcohol. The manufacture, sale, transportation, import, and export of alcoholic beverages were illegal in the United States during the time known as the Prohibition in the 1920s and early 1930s.

===Heroin===


In the 1950s and 1960s, most heroin was produced in Turkey and transshipped in France via the &quot;French Connection&quot; crime ring, with much of it arriving in the United States. This resulted in the record setting April 26, 1968 seizure of of heroin smuggled in a vehicle on the &quot;SS France (1960) ocean liner.&quot; By the time of The French Connection (1971 film), this route was being supplanted.

Then, until , the majority of the world&#x27;s heroin was produced in an area known as the Golden Triangle. However, by 2007, 93% of the opiates on the world market originated in Afghanistan. This amounted to an export value of about US$4 billion, with a quarter being earned by opium farmers and the rest going to district officials, insurgents, warlords and drug traffickers. Another significant area where poppy fields are grown for the manufacture of heroin is Mexico. In November 2023, a U.N report showed that in the entirety of Afghanistan, poppy cultivation dropped by over 95%, removing it from its place as being the world&#x27;s largest opium producer.

According to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the price of heroin is typically valued 8 to 10 times that of cocaine on American streets, making it a high-profit substance for smugglers and dealers. In Europe (except the transit countries Portugal and the Netherlands), for example, a purported gram of street heroin, usually consisting of 700–800 mg of a light to dark brown powder containing 5–10% heroin base, costs €30–70, making the effective value per gram of pure heroin €300–700. Heroin is generally a preferred product for smuggling and distribution—over unrefined opium due to the cost-effectiveness and increased efficacy of heroin.

Because of the high cost per volume, heroin is easily smuggled. A US quarter-sized (2.5 cm) cylindrical vial can contain hundreds of doses. From the 1930s to the early 1970s, the so-called French Connection supplied the majority of US demand. Allegedly, during the Vietnam War, drug lords such as Ike Atkinson used to smuggle hundreds of kilograms of heroin to the US in coffins of dead American soldiers (see Cadaver Connection). Since that time it has become more difficult for drugs to be imported into the US than it had been in previous decades, but that does not stop the heroin smugglers from getting their product across US borders. Purity levels vary greatly by region with Northeastern cities having the most pure heroin in the United States. On 17 October 2018 police in Genoa, Italy discovered 270 kg of heroin hidden in a ship coming from the Iranian southern port of Bandar Abbas. The ship had already passed and stopped at Hamburg in Germany and Valencia in Spain.

Penalties for smuggling heroin or morphine are often harsh in most countries. Some countries will readily hand down a death sentence (e.g. Singapore) or life in prison for the illegal smuggling of heroin or morphine, which are both internationally Schedule I drugs under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.

In May 2021, Romania seized 1.4 tonnes of heroin at Constanța port of a shipment from Iran that was headed for Western Europe.

===Methamphetamine===
Methamphetamine is another popular drug among distributors. Three common street names are &quot;meth&quot;, &quot;crank&quot;, and &quot;ice&quot;.

According to the Community Epidemiology Work Group, the number of clandestine methamphetamine laboratory incidents reported to the National Clandestine Laboratory Database decreased from 1999 to 2009. During this period, methamphetamine lab incidents increased in mid-western States (Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, and Ohio), and in Pennsylvania. In 2004, more lab incidents were reported in Missouri (2,788) and Illinois (1,058) than in California (764). In 2003, methamphetamine lab incidents reached new highs in Georgia (250), Minnesota (309), and Texas (677). There were only seven methamphetamine lab incidents reported in Hawaii in 2004, though nearly 59 percent of substance use treatment admissions (excluding alcohol) were for primary methamphetamine use during the first six months of 2004. As of 2007, Missouri leads the United States in drug-lab seizures, with 1,268 incidents reported. Often canine units are used for detecting rolling meth labs which can be concealed on large vehicles, or transported on something as small as a motorcycle. These labs are more difficult to detect than stationary ones, and can often be obscured among legal cargo in big trucks.

Methamphetamine is sometimes used intravenously, placing users and their partners at risk for transmission of HIV and hepatitis C. &quot;Meth&quot; can also be inhaled, most commonly vaporized on aluminum foil or in a glass pipe. This method is reported to give &quot;an unnatural high&quot; and a &quot;brief intense rush&quot;.

In South Africa, methamphetamine is called &quot;tik&quot; or &quot;tik-tik&quot;. Known locally as &quot;tik&quot;, the substance was virtually unknown as late as 2003. Now, it is the country&#x27;s main addictive substance, even when alcohol is included. Children as young as eight are abusing the substance, smoking it in crude glass vials made from light bulbs. Since methamphetamine is easy to produce, the substance is manufactured locally in staggering quantities.

The government of North Korea currently operates methamphetamine production facilities. There, the drug is used as medicine because no alternatives are available; it also is smuggled across the Chinese border.

The Australian Crime Commission&#x27;s illicit drug data report for 2011–2012 stated that the average strength of crystal methamphetamine doubled in most Australian jurisdictions within a 12-month period, and the majority of domestic laboratory closures involved small &quot;addict-based&quot; operations.

===Temazepam===
Temazepam, a strong hypnotic benzodiazepine, is illicitly manufactured in clandestine laboratories (called &quot;jellie labs&quot;) to supply the increasingly high demand for the drug internationally. Many clandestine temazepam labs are in Eastern Europe. The labs manufacture temazepam by chemically altering diazepam, oxazepam or lorazepam. &quot;Jellie labs&quot; have been identified and shut down in Russia, Ukraine, Latvia and Belarus.

===Cocaine===

Cocaine is a highly trafficked drug. In 2017 the value of the global market for illicit cocaine was estimated at between $94 and $143 billion. In 2022, illicit sales in Europe were estimated at $11.1 billion. In 2020, almost 2,000 tons of cocaine were produced for distribution through illicit markets.

=== Fentanyl ===

Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is 20 to 40 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine; its primary clinical utility is in pain management for cancer patients and those recovering from painful surgeries. Illicit use of fentanyl continues to fuel an epidemic of synthetic opioid drug overdose deaths in the US. From 2011 to 2021, synthetic opioid deaths per year increased from 2,600 overdoses to 70,601. Since 2018, fentanyl and its analogues have been responsible for most drug overdose deaths in the US, causing over 71,238 deaths in 2021. Fentanyl is often mixed, cut, or ingested alongside other drugs, including cocaine and heroin. The fentanyl epidemic has erupted in a highly acrimonious dispute between the US and Mexican governments. While US officials blame the flood of fentanyl crossing the border primarily on Mexican crime groups, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador insists that the main source of this synthetic drug is Asia. He believes that the crisis of a lack of family values in the US drives people to use the drug.

<text>DoJa profile is a Java application environment specification for DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode mobile phone.

DoJa is based on the Java ME CLDC API that is defined in the Java Community Process (JCP). DoJa is a profile defined by NTT DoCoMo to provide communications and other input-output processing, user interface (GUI) and other application features/functions unique to i-mode, and extension libraries defined by individual phone terminal makers to add original functions. However, in contrast with other Java ME profiles like Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) or Information Module Profile (IMP), DoJa is not defined as a Java Specification Request (JSR), hence it is often called a &quot;proprietary&quot; Java ME profile.

DoJa allows i-mode to offer more dynamic and interactive content than conventional HTML-based i-mode content. Java for i-mode consists of support for a version of CLDC and a version of the DoJa profile. CLDC support can be 1.0 or 1.1 depending on the handset. The DoJa profile was originally created for the local Japanese market with version 1.0 and version 2.0 more or less corresponding to MIDP 1.0 and MIDP 2.0. For the market outside Japan a new API has been created, which is referred to as the Overseas Edition. Currently DoJa 1.5oe and DoJa 2.5oe are implemented on handsets sold in Europe. (The first DoJa handset with DoJa1.5oe is N341i launched in 2003 from NEC, and the first DoJa 2.5 handset is M430i launched in the beginning of 2005 from Mitsubishi.) The DoJa Profile provides for use with i-mode extension library (Java for i-mode profiles), including user interfaces and HTTP communications.

== DoJa Profiles ==
&quot;Star&quot; is the successor to DoJa, rather than being part of it, with access to modern hardware and services such as the accelerometer.

<doc id="218456" wikidata="Q5308899" url="?curid=218456" title="Drug paraphernalia">
<text>The term drug paraphernalia refers to any equipment that is used to produce, conceal, and consume illicit drugs. It includes but is not limited to items such as bongs, roach clips, miniature spoons, and various types of pipes. 

==Product types==
In the United States, Under federal law the term drug paraphernalia means “any equipment, product or material of any kind which is primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, concealing, producing, processing, preparing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance.”

=== Aluminum foil ===
&quot;Chasing the dragon&quot; (CTD) (), or &quot;foily&quot; in Australian English, refers to inhaling the vapor of a powdered psychoactive drug off a heated sheet of aluminium foil. The moving vapor is chased after with a tube (often rolled foil) through which the user inhales. 

=== Banknotes (risky &quot;drug paraphernalia&quot;) ===


Sharing snorting equipment (straws, banknotes, bullets, etc) has been linked to the transmission of hepatitis C. (Bonkovsky and Mehta) In one study, the University of Tennessee Medical Center researches warned that other blood-borne diseases such as HIV, the AIDS-causing virus, could be transmitted as well. 

=== Scales ===
=== Gravity bong ===


A gravity bong, also known as a GB, bucket bong, grav, geeb, gibby, yoin, or ghetto bong, is a method of consuming smokable substances such as cannabis. The term describes both a bucket bong and a waterfall bong, since both use air pressure and water to draw smoke. A lung uses similar equipment but instead of water draws the smoke by removing a compacted plastic bag or similar from the chamber.

The bucket bong is made out of two containers, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.

=== Love rose ===

A &quot;love rose&quot; is a glass tube with a paper or plastic rose inside of it, and a bit of cork or foil on the ends to keep the rose from falling out. While ostensibly intended as romantic gifts, their primary known use is as a pipe to smoke drugs such as crack cocaine or methamphetamine. They are commonly sold at convenience stores in the United States, particularly in inner-city locations.

=== Magnifying lens ===
Solar puffing (also called &quot;solar toking&quot; or &quot;taking solar hits&quot;) is the act of using the sun&#x27;s rays with a magnifying lens or burning glass to heat cannabis for consumption.

===Drug designed equipment===

====Bong====
A bong (also known as a water pipe) is a filtration device generally used for smoking cannabis, tobacco, or other herbal substances. 

Bongs have been in use by the Hmong in Laos and Thailand, as well all over Africa, for centuries. 

====Bulb syringe====


====Cocaine spoon====
A snuff spoon is a tiny spoon used for nasal insufflation of powdered substances. In the ancient time the spoons were used to ingest psychotropic substances, in the 18th century − tobacco, in the 20th century − cocaine (the spoon is thus also known as a cocaine spoon or coke spoon). Some local statutes in the US treat this spoon as drug paraphernalia, defining it as a spoon that is too small and thus &quot;unsuited for the typical, lawful uses of a spoon&quot;.

====Glass blades====

Spots (also known as spotting, knifers, knife hits, knife tokes, dots, hot knives, kitchen tracking blades, or bladers) refers to a method of smoking cannabis. Small pieces of cannabis are rolled (or simply torn from a larger bud) to form the spot.

The practice originated in the 1970s when drops or dabs of hashish oil were smoked (three dabs of hash oil were considered to be a good standard dose). Generally, the tips of two knife blades are heated, the spot or drop of hash oil, is compressed between the two blades, and the subsequent smoke is inhaled through the nose or mouth. 

Another means that is gaining popularity is specially made glass presses heated with a propane or butane torch. In order to facilitate this process, a &quot;spottle&quot; (also referred to as a &quot;bowser&quot;, &quot;hooter&quot; or &quot;toker&quot;) or &quot;hitter&quot; is often, but not always, used to funnel the smoke and maximize the amount inhaled. A spottle is generally made from a funnel or cone-shaped container, such as the top (or neck) of a plastic or glass bottle or a gallon of milk/water.

====One-hitter====
A one-hitter has been considered drug paraphernalia in certain regions.

====Pizzo====

A pizzo – also known as an pilo, oil burner, bubble, tweak pipe, meth pipe, gack pipe, crank pipe, crack pipe, pookie pipe, chicken bone, or ice pipe – AKA “Billy” – is a glass pipe which consists of a tube connected to a spherical bulb with a small opening on top designed for smoking methamphetamine or freebasing crack cocaine as well as other drugs. There are some legitimate uses for these pipes including applying the hole &quot;on the top of an eucalyptus bottle&quot; for inhaling aromas or moisture.

====Snuff bullets====


====Free base equipment====


==Contamination==


Sharing snorting equipment (straws, banknotes, bullets, etc) has been linked to the transmission of hepatitis C. (Bonkovsky and Mehta) In one study, the University of Tennessee Medical Center researches warned that other blood-borne diseases such as HIV, the AIDS-causing virus, could be transmitted as well.

Bongs that are cleaned regularly eliminates yeast, fungi, bacteria and pathogens that can cause several symptoms that vary from allergy to lung infection.

Re-used uncleaned vapes, and vape sharing, may cause bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, and viral pneumonia.

== Legality ==

===United States===
In the US, enterprising individuals would sell items openly in the street, until anti-paraphernalia laws in the 1980s eventually ended the practice. With the growth of the Internet, drug paraphernalia sellers have greatly expanded their sales to a worldwide market.

According to the Federal Drug Paraphernalia Statute, 21 USC 863, which is part of the Controlled Substances Act, in the US it is illegal to sell, transport through the mail, transport across state lines, import, or export drug paraphernalia as defined. Possession is usually illegal under State law. The law gives specific guidance on determining what constitutes drug paraphernalia. Many states have also enacted their own laws prohibiting drug paraphernalia. In the 1982 case &quot;Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.&quot;, the US Supreme Court found a municipal ordinance requiring licensing for paraphernalia sales to have sufficiently distinguished marketing for illegal use to be constitutional. Government crackdowns have resulted in the arrest of sellers of recreational drug paraphernalia, such as actor Tommy Chong, who spent time in prison in 2003 for having his name used on bongs for sale via the internet.
Head shops are very much alive and well in the US, however. Generally, though, they have signs near presumable paraphernalia saying &quot;For tobacco use only&quot; or &quot;Not for use with illicit drugs.&quot; Many also ban customers for referencing the use of illegal drugs when buying items. Similar policies are used in online head shops, where customers are often made to verify detailed disclaimers of their non-use of illegal substances before buying items.

====Reagent testing====
Home pill testing equipment is illegal in the US state of Illinois where the (720 ILCS 600/) Drug Paraphernalia Control Act specifically outlaws &quot;testing equipment intended to be used unlawfully in a private home for identifying or in analyzing the strength, effectiveness or purity of cannabis or controlled substances;&quot;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, while cannabis is illegal, owning drug paraphernalia is not illegal, but under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the individual may be committing a criminal offense if the items contain traces of drugs.

Under Section 9A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, It is a criminal offense &quot;to supply or offer to supply an object for providing or preparing a controlled drug if a person believes that the article will be used in circumstances where the administration is unlawful. If convicted in a magistrates&#x27; court, the penalty is a maximum of six months in prison and/or a £5,000 fine.

===Sweden===

====Injection equipment====
In Sweden, pharmacies can only sell syringes and hypodermic needles to people with a doctor&#x27;s prescription for medical use.

<text>Lützen () is a town in the Burgenlandkreis district of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

==Geography==
Lützen is situated in the Leipzig Bay, approximately southwest of the Leipzig city limits and northeast of Weißenfels. The town has access to the Bundesstraße 87 road from Leipzig to Weißenfels as well as to the Bundesautobahn 9 (at the Bad Dürrenberg junction) and the Bundesautobahn 38.

The municipal area comprises the following &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions:
*Lützen
*Meuchen, incorporated in 1973
*Röcken, incorporated in 2009
*Großgörschen, Muschwitz, Poserna, Rippach and Starsiedel, incorporated in 2010
*Dehlitz, Sössen and Zorbau, incorporated in 2011

==History==
Held by the Prince-Bishops of Merseburg, Lützen Castle from the 13th century onwards was the seat of the local administration (&quot;Amt&quot;). After the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig, the town increasingly fell under the Wettin electors of Saxony, until the episcopal lands were finally secularised in 1547; from 1656/57 until 1738 it was held by the secundogeniture of Saxe-Merseburg.

The town was the scene of two famous battles:
*The Battle of Lützen (1632) in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in which the Swedish forces under King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden defeated an Imperial army led by Albrecht von Wallenstein. However, Gustavus Adolphus himself died on the battlefield, resulting in the battle being a Pyrrhic victory for Sweden. There is a statue in Lützen in his memory. Also, there is a stone, called Schwedenstein (Swedenstone), covered by a Neo-Gothic style monument designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel in 1837 on the spot on the battlefield where he died. Close to this there is a memorial chapel in his honour. 
*The Battle of Lützen (1813), in which Napoleon launched the German Campaign. He defeated the combined Russian and Prussian forces near the village of Großgörschen, although with heavy losses. In the night before the battle, he had ostentatiously camped at the Gustavus Adolphus memorial stone.

By 1815 resolution of the Vienna Congress, Lützen fell to the Prussian province of Saxony. Part of the Soviet occupation zone after World War II, the town belonged to the East German district of Halle from 1952 to 1990.

In 2017 a mass grave with 47 bodies from the Battle of Lützen (1632) were found near the town.

==Politics==

Seats in the town&#x27;s assembly (&quot;Stadtrat&quot;) as of 2019 local elections:
*Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU): 4
*Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD): 3
*The Left: 2
*Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens: 2
*National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD): 1
*Free Democratic Party (FDP): 1
*Independents: 7

==Notable people==
*Johann Gottfried Seume (1763–1810), author 
*Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), philosopher, cultural critic, poet and scholar

<text>The president of Austria () is the head of state of the Republic of Austria.

The office of the president was established in 1920 by the Constituent National Assembly of the first republic following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Habsburg monarchy in 1918. As head of state, the president indirectly succeeded the emperor of Austria. The power and role of the presidency has varied drastically over time. During the early first republic, the president was an utterly powerless figurehead. In the late first republic, the president received tremendous power but this power was swiftly taken away again following the abrogation of the Constitution and the erection of a corporatist dictatorship in 1934. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the presidency was completely abolished. Following the liberation of Austria by the allied forces in 1945, the republican Constitution was restored and so was the office of the president. Though the president regained the tremendous power they held before the corporatist era, since the second republic, the president voluntarily chose to serve as a ceremonial and symbolic figurehead, allowing the chancellor to become chief executive instead. Since the institution of the popular vote in 1951, only nominees of the Social Democratic Party and the People&#x27;s Party had been elected to the presidency, with the exception of the Green-endorsed incumbent Alexander Van der Bellen.

The most notable presidential power is the appointment of the chancellor, the vice chancellor and the ministers, which collectively form the Cabinet of Austria. The president also signs bills into law, appoints the justices of the Supreme Courts, signs treaties and exercises various ceremonial duties. Additionally, the president is empowered to remove the chancellor and the Cabinet, dissolve the National Council and the State Legislatures, rule by decree and oversee the Armed Forces but these powers have never or rarely been used. The president ranks first in Austria&#x27;s order of precedence, ahead of the Presidium of the National Council and the chancellor.

The workplace and official residence of the president is located in the Leopoldine Wing of the Hofburg Imperial Palace in Vienna.
== History ==
=== Background ===

Prior to the collapse of the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire towards the end of World War I, what now is the Republic of Austria had been part of a monarchy with an emperor as its head of state and chief executive. The empire noticeably began to fracture in late 1917 and manifestly disintegrated into a number of independent rump states over the course of the following year.

As the emperor had grown practically powerless, the members of the lower chamber of the Imperial Council – representing Cisleithania, including the empire&#x27;s ethnically German provinces – formed a Provisional National Assembly for their paralyzed country on 21 October 1918. On 30 October, the National Assembly passed the &quot;Staatsgründungsbeschluss&quot;, the law that proclaimed the creation of German-Austria and served as its provisional constitution. Additionally, the National Assembly appointed three coequal chairmen, one of them being Karl Seitz, and established a State Council to administer the executive branch. For about two weeks, the Empire and German-Austria co-existed, having a roughly similar population and territory.

On 11 November, Emperor Charles I dissolved the Imperial Cabinet and officially renounced any participation in government affairs but did not abdicate, seeing this move only as a temporary break from his rule. However, the next day, the National Assembly proclaimed German-Austria to be a republic. Despite the effective dissolution of the Empire, the monarchy officially still continued to exist and Emperor Charles I continued exercising ceremonial powers as German-Austria refused to be seen as the successor to Austria-Hungary and thus the monarchy was not legally abolished; only following the passage of the Habsburg Law in April 1919, the monarchy formally ceased to exist and Charles I was dethroned and exiled.

The State Council assumed the remaining powers and responsibilities of the emperor, while the three assembly chairmen – as chairmen of the State Council – became the country&#x27;s collective head of state.

=== Establishment ===
On 4 March 1919, the Constituent National Assembly, the first parliament to be elected by universal suffrage, convened and named Seitz its chairman a day later. The National Assembly disbanded the State Council on 15 March – hence Seitz became the sole head of state – and began drafting a new Constitution the same year. The Christian Social Party advocated creating a presidency with comprehensive executive powers, similar to the presidency of the Weimar Republic. However, the Social Democratic Worker&#x27;s Party, fearing that such a president would become a &quot;substitute emperor&quot;, favored reverting to a parliamentary presidium acting as collective head of state. In the end, the framers of the Constitution opted for a compromise, creating a presidency that was separate from the legislature but lacked even nominal power.
On 1 October, the Federal Constitutional Law, the centerpiece of the new Constitution, was ratified by the National Assembly and on 10 November, it became effective, making Seitz president of Austria in all but name. The new Constitution established the president to be elected by the Federal Assembly, a joint session of both houses of the now-bicameral Parliament. On 9 December 1920, the Federal Assembly elected Michael Hainisch as the first official president of Austria.

=== First Republic ===
The parliamentary system erected by the new Constitution was highly unpopular with the majority of the population. This led to surging support for the authoritarian and paramilitary &quot;Heimwehr&quot; movement, which preferred a system that strengthens presidential authority. On 7 December 1929, under growing pressure from the &quot;Heimwehr&quot;, the Constitution was amended to give the president sweeping executive and legislative power. Although most of these powers were to be exercised through the ministers, on paper the president now had powers equivalent to those of presidents in presidential systems. It also called for the office to be elected by popular vote and expanded the president&#x27;s term to six years. The first election was scheduled for 1934. However, owing to the financial ramifications of the Great Depression, all parties agreed to suspend the election in favor of having Wilhelm Miklas reelected by the Federal Assembly.

Three years later, Engelbert Dollfuss and the Fatherland Front tore down Austrian parliamentarism altogether, formally annulling the Constitution on 1 May 1934. It was replaced by an authoritarian and corporatist system of government that concentrated power in the hands of the chancellor, not the president. Miklas was stripped of the authority he had gained in 1929, but agreed to act as a figurehead for the sake of institutional continuity anyway. He was not entirely powerless, however; during the &quot;Anschluss&quot; crisis, he provided some of the stiffest resistance to Nazi demands. He technically remained in office until 13 March 1938, the day Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany and thus lost its sovereignty. The annexation was legally formalised after Austria and Germany simultaneously passed what was effectively the same law; a plebiscite with 99% support was intended to give the &quot;Anschluss&quot; additional democratic legitimacy.
=== Second Republic ===
When Austria was re-established as an independent state on 27 April 1945, the party leaders forming the provisional cabinet decided not to write a new constitution, instead reverting to that of 1920, as amended in 1929. Even though this revision was still somewhat controversial at that point, it was part of Austria&#x27;s most recent constitutional framework, giving it at least some much-needed form of democratic legitimacy. The party leaders were also afraid that lengthy discussion might provoke the Red Army, then in control of Vienna, to barge in and impose Communist rule. The Constitution thus reenacted, effective 1 May, therefore still entailed the provision calling for popular election of the president. Following the November 1945 legislative election, however, the Federal Assembly temporarily suspended this provision and installed Karl Renner as president of Austria as of 20 December. The suspension in question seemed to have been motivated mainly by a lack of money; no attempt was ever made to prolong it, and Renner had already been the universally accepted, &quot;de facto&quot; head of state anyway. Starting with the 1951 election of Renner&#x27;s successor Theodor Körner, all presidents have in fact been elected by the people.

Since the restoration of the republic, presidents have taken an increasingly passive role in day-to-day politics (&quot;Rollenverzicht&quot;) and are rarely ever the focus of the press, except during presidential elections and political upheavals. A notable exception was Kurt Waldheim, who became the subject of national and international controversy, after his service in the Wehrmacht and the Sturmabteilung were revealed to the public. Another exception was Thomas Klestil, who attempted to assume a far more active political role; he called for the grand coalition to remain in power and demanded to represent Austria in the European Council but ultimately failed on both counts. 

Alexander Van der Bellen (generally associated with the Green Party) became the first president not affiliated with either of the two dominant parties – the Social Democratic Party and the People&#x27;s Party – and the first president to dismiss a chancellor as well as an entire Cabinet as a result of a parliamentary ouster.

== Election ==
=== Procedure ===
The president of Austria is elected by popular vote for a term of six years and is limited to two consecutive terms of office. Voting is open to all people entitled to vote in general parliamentary elections, which in practice means that suffrage is universal for all Austrian citizens over the age of sixteen that have not been convicted of a jail term of more than one year of imprisonment. (Even so, they regain the right to vote six months after their release from prison.)

Until 1 October 2011, with the exception of members of any ruling or formerly ruling dynastic houses (a measure of precaution against monarchist subversion, and primarily aimed at members of the House of Habsburg), anyone entitled to vote in elections to the National Council who is at least 35 years of age is eligible for the office of president. The exception of ruling or formerly ruling dynasties has been abolished meanwhile within the &quot;Wahlrechtsänderungsgesetz 2011&quot; (Amendment of the law on the right to vote 2011) due to an initiative by Ulrich Habsburg-Lothringen.

The president is elected under the two-round system. This means that if no candidate receives an absolute majority (i.e. more than 50%) of valid votes cast in the first round, then a second ballot occurs in which only those two candidates who received the greatest number of votes in the first round may stand. However, the constitution also provides that the group that nominates one of these two candidates may instead nominate an alternative candidate in the second round. If there is only one candidate standing in a presidential election then the electorate is granted the opportunity to either accept or reject the candidate in a referendum.

While in office the president cannot belong to an elected body or hold any other position.

=== Oath of office ===
Article 62 of the Austrian Constitution provides that the president must take the following oath or affirmation of office in the presence of the Federal Assembly (although the addition of a religious asseveration is admissible):

===Latest elections===
== Powers and duties ==
The presidency as well as its powers and duties are established by the Federal Constitutional Law, while additional powers may be rooted in statutory law, convention or precedent.

Every act of the president requires a request or/and a countersignature to become effective, unless the Constitution expressly says otherwise. While requests are made on a discretionary basis, countersignatures exist to confirm that the act has in fact been signed by the president and meets all constitutional prerequisites. The countersigning authority is also responsible for implementing the act.

=== Executive ===
==== Appointment of the Cabinet ====

The president appoints the chancellor, the vice chancellor, and the ministers, which collectively form the Cabinet of Austria.

A new National Council, the dominant lower chamber of Parliament, is elected at least every five years by universal suffrage. Following such an election, the president, according to political convention, charges the chancellor candidate of the party that won the most seats with the formation of a new Cabinet. Theoretically, the president could appoint any adult citizen eligible to be elected to the National Council as chancellor. However, the National Council can adopt a motion of no confidence against the chancellor, a minister, or the entire Cabinet at any time, and the President is constitutionally required to dismiss any minister whom the National Council wants gone. In practice, this means the chancellor must be acceptable to the National Council and maintain its confidence.

If no party wins an absolute majority (the common electoral outcome since 1983), the leader of the largest party will search for a junior coalition partner to create a politically stable Cabinet that commands the support of the National Council. This process will kick off with a series of rather brief &quot;exploratory discussions&quot; (&quot;Sondierungsgespräche&quot;) with all parties, which usually lasts several weeks. During this time, the chancellor candidate will commonly seek out the party most willing to compromise. Once a potential partner is found, the winning party will subsequently enter more serious and comprehensive &quot;coalition negotiations&quot; (&quot;Koalitionsverhandlungen&quot;), a process usually lasting several months. The objective of the coalition negotiations is to produce a cabinet agenda (&quot;Regierungsprogramm&quot;), a coalition contract (&quot;Koalitionsvertrag&quot;) and a ministers&#x27; list (&quot;Ministerliste&quot;), which determines the Cabinet&#x27;s composition. The leader of the junior partner usually receives the vice chancellorship and an additional ministry.

Following the end of the negotiations, the leader of the winning party submits the ministers&#x27; list to the president, who can either accept or reject it. If the president accepts, the new Cabinet will be appointed and officially sworn in at an inauguration ceremony. If the president rejects the list, there are several options; the president asks the chancellor candidate to rewrite the list or omit certain nominees, charges someone else with the formation of a cabinet or calls new elections.

There have only been three instances where a president refused to appoint a Cabinet nominee; Karl Renner denied to re-appoint a minister suspected of corruption, Theodor Körner dismissed the demand of Chancellor Leopold Figl to appoint a Cabinet that would have included the far-right Federation of Independents, and Thomas Klestil declined to appoint a nominee that has been indicted and a nominee who had made frequent extremist and xenophobic remarks.

==== Removal of the Cabinet ====
The president can remove the chancellor or the entire Cabinet such at will. However, individual Cabinet members can only be dismissed by the president on the request of the chancellor. So far, the dismissal of an entire Cabinet against its will has never occurred. President Wilhelm Miklas did not make use of this power when Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß absolished the Constitution to establish the dictatorial Federal State of Austria.

The removal of a minister against their will occurred only once, when Chancellor Sebastian Kurz asked President Alexander Van der Bellen to remove Interior Minister Herbert Kickl. Ensuing the Ibiza affair and a likely collapse of the Cabinet, Kickl moved to appoint Peter Goldgruber – with whom he had close ties – to the office of director general for Public Security, which would have granted him direct control over Austrian law enforcement. President Alexander Van der Bellen refused to assent Goldgruber&#x27;s appointment – following a convention to avoid high-level appointments during transition periods – thus preventing him from taking office. 

The president is the only person legally able to remove any Cabinet member (including the chancellor) from office. Even if a Cabinet member resigns or is ousted by a no confidence vote, the president must remove them.

==== Appointment of other officers ====
From a legal perspective, the president appoints all federal officers and not just the members of Cabinet. This includes all military officers and soldiers, all judges as well as all ordinary functionaries. However, this constitutional power has been statutorily or conventionally delegated to the ministers and their subordinates. Though the president retains the right to personally appoint the top brass of the federal apparatus.

Because the governors of the states do not only serve as the chief executives of their respective state government but also as the representatives of the national Cabinet within that state, the president swears in all governors, following their election by the State Legislature.

=== Legislative ===
==== Signing bills into law ====

The president signs all bills into law. Signing bills into law is a duty and not a discretionary power of the president; it is not comparable with the presidential veto in the United States. When signing bills into law, it is the task of the president to check if a piece of legislation was enacted according to constitutional prerequisites. If that is not the case, the president must withhold their signature, which strikes down the bill. All federal bills, statutory and constitutional, must be signed by the president to become effective.

The president generally does not verify if an enacted statute complies with constitutional law; that falls within the purview of the Constitutional Court. Opinions regarding the extent of this responsibility have varied, with some arguing that the president may deny their signature if a statute is undoubtedly unconstitutional. President Heinz Fischer refused to sign a bill – containing criminal provisions with retrospective effect – into law; this remains the only time a president withheld their signature. 

Once a bill is introduced in Parliament, it must pass the National Council and be approved by the Federal Council to become enacted. Following its enactment, the bill is given to the chancellor, who submits it to the president. After the president signs the bill into law, the chancellor countersigns and then promulgates the bill in the federal law gazette, rendering it effective.

==== Dissolution of the National Council ====

The president may dissolve the National Council at the request of Cabinet, but only once for the same reason. The consequences of a presidential dissolution of the National Council differ from those of a &quot;self-dissolution&quot;. If the president terminates the legislative period, the National Council is considered immediately dissolved and thereby incapacitated. However, the Standing Subcommittee of the National Council&#x27;s Principal Committee remains as an emergency body until the newly-elected National Council convenes. In the case of self-dissolution, the old National Council keeps meeting until a new one is elected.

So far, only President Wilhelm Miklas has made use of this power, after the Christian Social Party had lost its coalition partner and thus the support of Parliament.

==== Dissolution of State Legislatures ====
The president can dissolve every State Legislature at the request of Cabinet and with the consent of the Federal Council. However, the president may only do so once for the same reason. The Federal Council must agree to the dissolution with a two-thirds supermajority. The delegation of the state whose legislature is to be dissolved, may not partake in the vote.

The dissolution of a State Legislature is viewed as an encroachment on federalism, as national authorities breach the autonomy and self-governance of the states. Until now, this power has never been used.

==== Emergency decrees ====
The president is authorized to rule by emergency decree in times of crisis. The Constitution states as follow:

Emergency decrees cannot alter the Constitution or essential laws. As soon as the National Council is in session again, it must approve or invalidate active emergency decrees. The power to rule by decree has never been used until now.

====Other legislative powers====
The president may call and adjourn sessions of the National Council. If requested by the Cabinet or one-third of the members of the National Council or the Federal Council, the president must call a session of the National Council. The president can also call a session of the Federal Assembly. Lastly, the president can instruct the administration of a binding (&quot;Volksabstimmung&quot;) or non-binding (&quot;Volksbefragung&quot;) plebiscite.

=== Judicial ===
==== Enforcement of Constitutional Court findings ====
The president is entrusted with the enforcement of findings (decisions) of the Constitutional Court, if said enforcement does not fall within the purview of ordinary courts. The request for presidential enforcement is filed by the Court itself. 

The Constitution provides the president with extensive powers when it comes to enforcing findings. As part of enforcements, the president may issue operational directives to any federal or state authorities.

==== Appointment of justices ====

The president appoints the president, the vice president, the six further justices, and the three substitute justices of the Constitutional Court on the recommendation of Cabinet; additionally, the president appoints three justices and two substitute justices on the recommendation of the National Council and three justices and one substitute justice on the recommendation of the Federal Council. 

The president also appoints all justices of the Supreme Court of Justice and the Supreme Administrative Court on the recommendation of the Cabinet. Thought the Cabinet may only chose from a pool of justices nominated by the Courts themselves.

====Presidential Clemency====

The president has the power of clemency, which includes pardons, sentence changes and commutations. According to the Constitutional Court, presidential pardons do not only void the sentence but also undo the conviction itself. The president also has the power to delete criminal record entries or limit who can access the criminal record of a person.

Convicts desiring clemency must file a request with the Ministry of Justice. The minister then personally approves or denies the request. If the request is approved, it is submitted to the president. The president usually accepts the minister&#x27;s decision. Though the president can always deny clemency, the president cannot grant clemency without a request from the minister of justice.

=== Diplomatic ===
The president is the chief diplomat of Austria and may negotiate and sign treaties with other countries, receive foreign emissaries, approve the appointment of consuls and personally appoint consular representatives. Treaties that change or supplement existing law must be approved by the National Council.

When Austria joined the European Union, President Thomas Klestil and Chancellor Franz Vranitzky had a disagreement on who would represent Austria in the European Council. Ultimately, the chancellor prevailed, though Klestil argued that he had only delegated his power of representation to the chancellor.

=== Military ===

The president is the commander-in-chief (&quot;Oberbefehlshaber&quot;) of the Austrian Armed Forces. This is perhaps the single most vague of any presidential powers; the extent of the president&#x27;s authority as commander-in-chief is largely subject to interpretation.

Although the president outranks the minister of defence and all military personnel in their capacity as commander-in-chief, presidential military authority is not expressly excluded from requiring countersignature or requests by the Constitution, meaning that this power can only be used in cooperation with the Cabinet.

Since no president has ever made use of this power, precedents were never established. Day-to-day military operations are administered by the minister of defense, who is referred to as supreme commander (&quot;Befehlshaber&quot;) of the Armed Forces by the Constitution. Defense policy and key decisions on the use of the military are usually made by the Cabinet as a whole.

As commander-in-chief, the president succeeds the emperor of Austria in his capacity as head of the Austro-Hungarian military. Following the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy, the Principal Committee of the newly established National Council began serving as the main decision-making body of the Armed Forces. In 1929, the Christian Social Party transferred supreme military authority from the Principal Committee to the president.

The president also grants commissions to officers but not in their capacity as commander-in-chief.

=== Ceremonial ===

The president has various additional powers and duties, which are typically vested in a head of state. These include, for example, the creation and conferment of honorary and professional titles, and the purely symbolic right to legitimise illegitimate children at the request of their parents. 

The president also confers the Decorations of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria, the most prestigious state decoration Austria has to offer. It is conferred for extraordinary achievements, especially in the areas of politics, science and culture, at the request of the Cabinet. The decorations consist of 15 classes, starting with the Bronze Medal and ending with the Grand Cross. The president automatically receives the Grand Cross upon assuming office.

Another power is the bestowal of the &quot;Promotio sub auspiciis Praesidentis rei publicae&quot;, a golden ring serving as the highest possible distinction and decoration for doctoral students.

== Incumbency ==
=== Immunity ===
The president generally enjoys immunity from any type of criminal procedures. The president may only be prosecuted with the explicit consent of the Federal Assembly. If a government authority intends to prosecute the president, it must file a request for prosecution with the National Council. If the National Council deems the request legitimate, the Federal Assembly is convened. 

The Constitution does not establish that a criminal conviction of the president by ordinary courts, automatically leads to a removal from office. However, a prison sentence would most certainly incapacitate the president, which would lead to a loss of all presidential authority.

=== Accountability ===
==== Political ====

The &quot;ordinary&quot; way of removing a sitting president from office would be through a plebiscite. Since the president is elected by the people, the president can also be removed by the people.

This process starts with a resolution of the National Council calling for a convocation of the Federal Assembly to consider the removal of the president. Such a resolution requires a supermajority (two-thirds support) and the attendance of at least half of all members of the National Council. If such a resolution is enacted, the president is automatically incapacitated and hence unable to &quot;further exercise the powers and duties of the presidency&quot;. Once the Federal Assembly is convened, it decides if a plebiscite should administered or not.

If the plebiscite favors a removal from office, the president is removed from office. If the plebiscite opposes a removal, a new legislative election is triggered and the National Council is automatically dissolved.

==== Legal ====
The president can be impeached before the Constitutional Court by the Federal Assembly for violating constitutional law. 

This process is triggered by either a resolution of the National Council or the Federal Council. If the resolution is successful, the Federal Assembly must convene. The Federal Assembly then contemplates impeaching the president. A supermajority and the attendance of at least half of all members of the National Council and the Federal Council is required to trigger the impeachment process.

If the Federal Assembly votes to impeach, it acts as plaintiff before the Constitutional Court. If the Court convicts the president for having violated the Constitution, the president is removed from office. If the president is found guilty of having committed only a minor offense, the president remains in office and is merely reprimanded.

=== Succession ===

The Constitution makes no provisions for an office of vice president. Should the president become temporarily incapacitated – undergoes surgery, becomes severely ill or visits a foreign country (excluding EU member states) – presidential powers and duties devolve upon the chancellor for a period of twenty days, although the chancellor does not receive a title like &quot;acting president&quot; during that time.

The powers and duties of the presidency devolve upon the Presidium of the National Council in the following three cases:
* The aforementioned period of twenty days expires, in which case the Presidium assumes presidential authority on the twenty-first day; 
* The office is vacated because the president dies in office, resigns or is removed from office, in which case the Presidium assumes presidential authority immediately;
* The president is unable to &quot;further exercise the powers and duties of the presidency&quot; because the National Council has convened the Federal Assembly to consider removing the president from office via plebiscite, in which case the Presidium also immediately assumes presidential authority.

When exercising the powers and duties of the presidency, the three presidents of the National Council – forming the Presidium – act collectively as one body. If votes are divided equally, the higher-ranking president has the power to break ties.

=== Compensation ===
The president is compensated for their public service with €349,398 annually, the chancellor in turn is compensated with €311,962 annually. This amount is particularly high when considering that the chancellor of Germany (€251,448), the president of France (€179,000), the prime minister of the United Kingdom (€169,284), the president of Russia (€125,973) and the president of China (€19,275) receive a significantly lower salary, though they are chief executives of substantially larger countries.

=== Workplace ===
The principal residence and workplace of the president is situated in the Leopoldine Wing in the Hofburg Imperial Palace, which is located in the Innere Stadt of Vienna. The Leopoldine Wing is sometimes ambiguously referred to as the &quot;Presidential Chancellery&quot;, the Office of the President. In reality however, the president does not actually reside in the Hofburg but retains their personal home.

As its name already divulges, the Hofburg is an edifice stemming from the imperial era; it was built under Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I in the 13th century. Ensuing the fall of the monarchy and the formation of the republic, democratic institutions intentionally kept their space from monarchic establishments. Hence, the original workplace of the president was actually the chancellery building. Following severe allied bombardments during World War II, the chancellery building sustained heavy damage and consequently became uninhabitable. Thus, the president had to find a new workplace. The first president of the Second Republic, Karl Renner, deliberately chose the Leopoldine Wing, as its creation and history (in particular the interior design) was largely influenced by Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresia, who had a popular public image at the time. The chancellery building was later rebuilt, renovated and renamed and now serves as the workplace of the chancellor.

Nowadays, the Leopoldine Wing harbours the offices of the Presidential Chancellery on its second and third floor. Next to the Hofburg, the president maintains a summer residence in Styria known as Mürzsteg Hunting Lodge. Although former President Heinz Fischer pledged to sell the building while campaigning for the presidency, the lodge has been used by him and his successor to host guests and foreign dignitaries.

=== Protection ===
The sitting president is legally protected by multiple criminal law provisions. The most notable one is § 249 of the Criminal Code:

The presidential title &quot;Bundespräsident&quot; is constitutionally protected and cannot be used by anyone else, even if combined with other words.

== Office of the President ==
The Office of the President (&quot;Präsidentschaftskanzlei&quot;) is an executive agency serving under the direct authority of the president. It advises the president on the exercise of presidential powers and duties, enables communication between the president and politicians, diplomats and citizens, and manages all other day-to-day administrative operations associated with the presidency. The agency is made up of various clerks, political advisers, legal counsellors, spokespeople as well as the presidential adjutant, an army officer formally charged with the protection of the president. The Office of the President is seated in the Leopoldine Wing of the Hofburg Imperial Palace.

<doc id="218470" wikidata="Q388841" url="?curid=218470" title="Aftenposten">
<text>&#x27; (; ; stylized as &#x27; in the masthead) is Norway&#x27;s largest printed newspaper by circulation as well as Norway&#x27;s newspaper of record. It is based in Oslo. It sold 211,769 daily copies in 2015 (172,029 printed copies according to University of Bergen) and estimated 1.2 million readers. It converted from broadsheet to compact format in March 2005. &quot;Aftenposten&quot;″s online edition is at Aftenposten.no. 

&quot;Aftenposten&quot; is a private company wholly owned by the public company Schibsted ASA. Norway&#x27;s second largest newspaper, &quot;VG&quot;, is also owned by Schibsted. Norwegian owners held a 42% of the shares in Schibsted at the end of 2015. 

The paper has around 240 employees. Trine Eilertsen was appointed editor-in-chief in 2020.

Aftenposten has correspondents based in Kyiv, Brussels, Washington D.C, Moscow and Istanbul (2025).

==History and profile==
&quot;Aftenposten&quot; was founded by Christian Schibsted on 14 May 1860 under the name &quot;Christiania Adresseblad&quot;. The following year, it was renamed &quot;Aftenposten&quot;. Since 1885, the paper has printed two daily editions. A Sunday edition was published until 1919, and was reintroduced in 1990. The Friday-morning edition carries the &quot;A-magasinet&quot; supplement, featuring articles on science, politics, and the arts. In 1886, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; bought a rotary press, being the first Norwegian newspaper in this regard.

Historically, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; labelled itself as &quot;independent, conservative&quot;, most closely aligning their editorial platform with the Norwegian Conservative Party. This manifested itself in blunt anticommunism during the interwar era. During World War II, &quot;Aftenposten&quot;, due to its large circulation, was put under the directives of the German occupational authorities, and a Nazi editorial management was imposed. Its editor-in-chief was H. Nesse at that time, and he was arrested and imprisoned in Grini concentration camp.

&quot;Aftenposten&quot; is based in Oslo. In the late 1980s, Egil Sundar served as the editor-in-chief and attempted to transform the paper into a nationally distributed newspaper. However, he was forced to resign from his post due to his attempt.

==Editions==
In addition to the morning edition, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; published a separate evening edition called &quot;Aften&quot; (previously &quot;Aftenposten Aften&quot;). This edition was published on weekdays and Saturdays until the Sunday morning edition was reintroduced in 1990. The evening edition was only circulated in the central eastern part of Norway, i.e. Oslo and Akershus counties. Thus, it focused on news related to this area, in contrast with the morning edition, which focuses on national and international news. The evening edition was converted to tabloid format in 1997. From April 2006, the Thursday edition of &quot;Aften&quot; also included a special edition with news specific to a part of Oslo or Akershus, called &quot;Lokal Aften&quot; (&quot;Local Evening&quot;). This edition had eight versions, with each subscriber receiving the version which is most relevant to the area in which he or she lives. In areas not covered by any of the eight versions (for example Romerike and Follo), the version for central Oslo was distributed. From May 2009, &quot;Aften&quot; was only printed and distributed Tuesday through Thursday. The publication of &quot;Aften&quot; ended on 20 December 2012.

&quot;Aftenposten&quot; started its online edition in 1995.

&quot;Aftenposten&quot; opposed the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky in 1935.

In 1945, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; published an obituary of Adolf Hitler in which the 86-year-old Nobel-laureate novelist Knut Hamsun referred to Hitler as &quot;a warrior for humankind and a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations&quot;. At that time, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; was under the censorship of the German occupying forces.

Historically, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; has not received the same number of lawsuits or as much attention from the Norwegian Press Complaints Commission as some of the larger tabloids. However, there are exceptions. In 2007, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; alleged that Julia Svetlichnaya, the last person to interview the murdered Russian national Alexander Litvinenko, was a Kremlin agent. London correspondent Hilde Harbo admitted having allowed herself to be fed disinformation emanating from the Russian emigrant community without investigating the matter properly. &quot;Aftenposten&quot; eventually had to apologize and pay Svetlichnaya&#x27;s legal costs.

In 2011 the newspaper was criticized by Jon Hustad for publishing conspiracy theories that promoted the false claim that convicted Soviet spy Arne Treholt was innocent, based entirely on a book by convicted fraudster Geir Selvik Malthe-Sørenssen that was revealed to be based on a fabricated source. In a study dated 2016 &quot;Aftenposten&quot; was found to contain the epithet &quot;Negro&quot; (Norwegian: &quot;neger&quot;) at the highest frequency in the period between 1970 and 2014 with 674 references. In 2021, the paper was criticized by the youth organization of the National Association for Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgender People for allegedly publishing articles that promoted transphobic conspiracy theories about trans women.

==Editorial line==
&quot;Aftenposten&quot; had a conservative stance and supported the political party Høyre until the breakdown of party press system in the country. Following this, the paper positioned itself as an independent centre-right newspaper.

==Language==
From its establishment in 1860 until 1923, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; was published in the common Dano-Norwegian written language used in both Norway and Denmark, which was generally known as Danish in Denmark and as Norwegian in Norway, and which only occasionally included minor differences from each other in vocabulary or idiom. In 1923 &quot;Aftenposten&quot; adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the &quot;soft&quot; consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with &quot;hard&quot; consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish. In 1928 &quot;Aftenposten&quot; adopted the most conservative variant of the spelling standard of 1917, which is largely similar to the &quot;moderate Bokmål&quot; or &quot;Riksmål&quot; standard used today.

During the Norwegian language struggle from the early 1950s, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; was the main newspaper of the Riksmål variety of Norwegian, and maintained close ties to the Riksmål movement&#x27;s institutions, recognising the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature as the sole authoritative body for regulating the Norwegian language as used by the newspaper. Due to its status as the country&#x27;s largest and most influential newspaper, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; Riksmål language used by &quot;Aftenposten&quot; was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the &quot;radical&quot; Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokmål with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten&#x27;s Riksmål standard and the government-promoted Bokmål standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokmål standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksmål. As a consequence, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; decided to describe its language as &quot;Moderate Bokmål&quot; from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksmål and Moderate Bokmål, but excluding &quot;radical&quot; (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokmål.

The online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an English section. To cut costs, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; stopped publishing English-language articles in early November 2008. Archives of past material are still available online.

<text> () is one of Norway&#x27;s largest newspapers and is published in the tabloid format. It has 1,400,000 daily readers on mobile, web and paper. Traditionally it was considered the main liberal newspaper of Norway, with a generally liberal progressive editorial outlook, to some extent associated with the movement of cultural radicalism in Scandinavian history.

The paper edition had a circulation of 46,250 copies in 2016, down from a peak of 228,834 in 1994. The editor-in-chief is Frode Hansen, the political editor is Lars Helle, the news editor is Jan Thomas Holmlund.

 is published six days a week and includes the additional feature magazine &quot;Magasinet&quot; every Saturday. Part of the daily tabloid is available at &quot;Dagbladet.no&quot;, and more articles can be accessed through a paywall. The daily readership of ″s online tabloid was 1.24 million in 2016. Dagbladet online has received widespread criticism for their unprecedented use of clickbait headlines. This in turn has been speculated to be a reason why their reach has seen a regression in recent years. 
==History==
 was founded in 1869 by Anthon Bang. Hagbard Emanuel Berner served as its first editor in chief and the first issue was published on 2 January 1869. From 1884 to 1977, the newspaper was affiliated to the Liberal party (&quot;Venstre&quot;). Since 1977, it has officially been politically neutral, though it has kept its position as a liberal newspaper, also incorporating some culturally radical stands in issues like the language struggle, church policies, feminism, intimate relationship, criminal care, etc. The newspaper was in 1972 against Norway joining the EU, but had changed to pro in 1994. During the German occupation of Norway the editor of , Einar Skavlan, was arrested in April 1942 due to the paper&#x27;s liberal stance and loyalty to the King.

 has played an important role in development of new editorial products in Norway. In 1990, the newspaper was the first in Norway to publish a Sunday edition in more than 70 years, and in 1995, it became the first of the major Norwegian newspapers with an online edition. In 2007 it had a circulation of 204,850 copies. The actual first newspaper was a regional paper called &quot;Brønnøysunds Avis&quot;. Over the past few years, has had success with the Saturday supplement &quot;Magasinet&quot;, which reaches 25.3% of the adult population of Norway.

Due to the declining of daily circulation, the newspaper has reduced the number of workers the last couple of years by a few hundred. Because of this, the newspaper focused more on &quot;simpler news&quot;, but recent years, the newspaper has chosen an editorial direction on hard news.

 was previously owned by the privately held company Berner Gruppen. Jens P. Heyerdahl was the largest owner and had effective control through several different companies. DB Medialab AS also owned 50% of the Norwegian web portal and ISP start.no and ran the online community Blink from 2002 to 2011.

In June 2013, with online products was sold from Berner Gruppen to Aller Media for reportedly about 300 million Norwegian kroner. As of 2016, 99% of the shares of Dagbladet AS are formally owned by Berner Media Holding AS, which in turn is 100% owned by Aller Media. The remaining 1% of Dagbladet AS is owned by the foundation Dagbladets Stiftelse.

Dagbladet operates a number of technological websites. The online community Blink was large for a period in the 2000s, before it was closed down. Dagbladet also operates Start.no and 123spill.no, but both have been inactive since 2016. Previously, Dagbladet also had the largest gaming website in the Nordic region, PressFire.no, but the website was discontinued by the media house in 2016. In 2018, Dagbladet started a gaming channel on YouTube, Dagbladet Spill, but this was closed down after a year.

Alexandra Beverfjord was the editor-in-chief from 2018 to 2023.

==Online edition==
The online edition of was launched on 8 March 1995 following Brønnøysunds Avis, a local newspaper. Dagbladet.no has a readership of nearly 1,2 million per day, which makes it amongst Europe&#x27;s most successful web newspapers when measured against both population and readership of mother newspaper.

==Criticism==
In 1988, was criticised for the aggressive use of photographs of grieving next-of-kin in the aftermath of the Flight 710 air-disaster. This led to a self-imposed change of practice within the Norwegian press regarding the handling of such incidents.

On 10 November 1989, the day after the fall of the Berlin wall, made no reference to the fall on its front page and instead featured the headline &quot;Let the children swear&quot;, a quote from child psychologist Magne Raundalen. This caused criticism and ridicule of the newspaper for being overly tabloid.

Former Minister of Health, Tore Tønne, committed suicide allegedly following &#x27;s investigations over alleged economic improprieties committed after the conclusion of his term in the Norwegian cabinet. was criticized by the Norwegian Press Association. The paper reprinted the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten&#x27;s 12 Muhammad Cartoons in 2005.

In May 2011, lost a libel case in Oslo District Court against ambulance driver Erik Schjenken for printing factual errors about the Paramedics incident in Oslo 2007, and was ordered to pay a compensation of 1 million Nkr. In 2013, Dagbladet lost the appeal case in Borgarting Court of Appeal, but the legal ruling was slightly changed and the compensation reduced to 200,000 Nkr. In May 2013, Dagbladet appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Norway.

The newspaper encountered criticism over a cartoon published in November 2011 that equated the Holocaust with the situation in the Gaza Strip. In 2013, Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Jewish communities, and human rights organizations claimed that a cartoon depicting the Jewish tradition of circumcision as barbaric was antisemitic. Editor of the culture-and-opinion sections in &quot;Dagbladet Geir Ramnefjell&quot; dismissed the criticism of the 2013 drawing, stating that it was an &quot;innocent ridicule of religious practice and nothing more than that&quot;. Dagbladet also defended the caricature in an editorial 3 June 2013. The Norwegian Centre Against Racism and the Mosaic community in Norway filed a complaint about the caricature to the Norwegian Press Complaints Commission, which did not find at fault.

<text>Underpants are underwear worn on the lower body generally extending no higher than the navel.
In British English they are often called simply pants.
If a given pair of underpants has a wider waistband, it might bear the brand name of the manufacturer on it.

== Types of underpants ==

=== Unisex ===

==== Long underpants ====

Long underpants are the bottom half of a style of two-piece underwear called long underwear, long johns, or thermal underwear, that has long legs and long sleeves, and is normally worn during cold weather; also commonly worn by people under their clothes in cold countries. The male version of a long underwear bottom may or may not have a front fly.

==== Briefs ====

Classic briefs have an elasticated waistband at or near the wearer&#x27;s waist, and leg bands that end at or near the groin. Many male briefs feature a fly. They also come in ultra-absorbent varieties.

==== Bikini briefs ====

Bikini briefs are a variation on classic briefs that have less coverage; though typically full coverage of the derrière. Conventionally, the men’s version has no fly.

==== Thong ====

Thongs are like bikini briefs, except the backside is very narrow and goes between the buttocks.

==== Open drawers ====

Open drawers are undergarments where the backs and front of the legs are not joined together.

==== Diapers ====

Diapers (North America) or nappies (Britain, Ireland, and Australia) are a type of underwear worn by young children and those suffering from incontinence. Unlike other briefs, diapers allow the wearer to urinate or defecate without soiling their surroundings. These can be either reusable or disposable.

=== Male ===

==== Midway briefs ====

Midway briefs are similar in style to boxer briefs, but are longer in the leg, at the longest being down to the knees.

==== Boxer shorts ====

Boxer shorts, boxers, or trunks (Britain), have an elasticated waistband that is at or near the wearer&#x27;s waist, while the leg sections are fairly loose and extend to the mid-thigh. There is usually a fly, either with or without buttons.

==== Boxer briefs ====

Boxer briefs are similar in style to boxer shorts, but are form-fitting like classic briefs. Like men’s briefs, they often utilize a fly.

Sometimes boxer briefs are called &quot;trunks&quot; (Britain), see next section.

==== Trunk briefs ====

Trunk briefs, also known as simply trunks, are shorter than boxer briefs but still have leg sections, unlike briefs.

=== Female ===

==== Panties ====

&quot;Panties&quot; is a general term for female underpants. There are a number of different styles including bikinis, boyshorts, briefs, cheekies, g-strings, hipsters, and thongs. The UK English equivalent is &quot;knickers&quot;.

<doc id="218476" wikidata="Q1501533" url="?curid=218476" title="General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches">
<text>The General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches (GAUFCC or colloquially British Unitarians) is the umbrella organisation for Unitarian, Free Christians, and other liberal religious congregations in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was formed in 1928, with denominational roots going back to the Great Ejection of 1662. Its headquarters is Essex Hall in central London, on the site of the first avowedly Unitarian chapel in England, set up in 1774.

The GAUFCC brought together various strands and traditions besides Unitarianism, including English Presbyterianism, General Baptist, Methodism, Liberal Christianity, Christian Universalism, Religious Humanism, and Unitarian Universalism. Unitarians are now an open-faith community celebrating diverse beliefs; some of its members would describe themselves as Buddhists, Pagans, or Jewish, while many others are humanists, agnostics, or atheists.

==History==
===Early Modern Britain===
Christopher Hill states that ideas such as anti-Trinitarianism, which scholars trace back to ancient times, were an integral part of &quot;the lower-class heretical culture which burst into the open in the 16th century&quot;. The cornerstones of this culture were anti-clericalism (opposition to the power of the Church) and a strong emphasis on biblical study, but there were specific heretical doctrines that had &quot;an uncanny persistence&quot;. In addition to anti-Trinitarianism, there was a rejection of predestination and an embrace of millenarianism, mortalism, and hermeticism. Such ideas became &quot;commonplace to 17th century Baptists, Levellers, Diggers, Seekers, … early Quakers and other radical groupings which took part in the free-for-all discussions of the English Revolution&quot;.

After the restoration of the Stuart monarchy and the resulting Act of Uniformity 1662, about 2,000 ministers left the established Church of England (the Great Ejection). Following the Act of Toleration 1689, many of these ministers preached in non-conforming congregations. The modern Unitarian denomination&#x27;s origins lay within this group of Protestants, the English Presbyterians, who were reluctant to become Dissenters. However, by the late 18th century, the influx of General Baptist congregations to the denomination established a direct lineage to this radical milieu—although by now, much of the heretical culture stigma no longer existed.

===19th century===
Until the passing of the Unitarian Relief Act in 1813, it was a criminal offence to deny the doctrine of the Trinity. By 1825 a new body, the British and Foreign Unitarian Association, itself an amalgamation of three previous societies, was set up to co-ordinate denominational activities. However, there was a setback in 1837 when &quot;the Presbyterian / Unitarian members were forced to withdraw from the General Body of Protestant Ministers which, for over a century, had represented the joint interests of the old established nonconformist groups in and around London&quot;.

Around this time Presbyterian / Unitarian opinion was once again divided about how far the denomination should be associated with the label &#x27;Unitarian&#x27;. James Martineau, a Presbyterian minister formerly based in Liverpool, pleaded for a &#x27;warmer&#x27; religion than the &#x27;critical, cold and untrusting&#x27; Unitarianism of his day. In 1881 he helped to found the National Conference of Unitarian, Liberal Christian, Free Christian, Presbyterian and other Non-Subscribing or Kindred Congregations—&quot;a triumph, one might say, of Victorian verbosity. But the length of the name reflected the breadth of Martineau&#x27;s vision&quot;.

Thus, from 1881 to the establishment of the GAUFCC, the denomination consisted of &quot;two overlapping circles, one labelled &#x27;Unitarian&#x27; and eager for organisation and propaganda, the other rejecting labels and treasuring comprehensiveness. Each side had its own college, its own newspaper and its own hymn book&quot;.

==Present day==
By 1928 these two &quot;overlapping circles&quot; had been reconciled in the same organisation: the GAUFCC. Over time the organisation has come to embrace a wider theological and philosophical diversity. &quot;At one extreme are the &#x27;Free Christians&#x27; who wish to remain part of the Church Universal; at the other are those who wish to move beyond Christianity&quot;.

The congregations of GAUFCC contain members who hold diverse opinions. Indeed, Unitarians are able to embrace and gain insights from the great world religions, philosophies, arts and modern sciences. The Unitarian Church does not follow one particular set of rules; owing to this, most Protestant denominations and Catholic dioceses do not recognise the baptisms or marriages it performs.

The official name is used on formal occasions, but in general use the organisation refers to itself and its members simply as Unitarian; the website URL is unitarian.org.uk, and the BBC religion page reflects this. The denomination supports same sex marriage.

==Member churches==
Many churches are architecturally significant and are listed buildings, often in the style known as Dissenting Gothic. Other churches have made a mark on public life, with historically significant members of the congregation or ministers. Either of these types may have a Wikipedia article.

==Affiliations==
The British Unitarians are a member of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists and of the European Liberal Protestant Network. The Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland maintains an Accord with the GAUFCC.

In addition to the approximately 170 congregations that are affiliated with the General Assembly, there are also groups within it. Some of these represent interests (history, music, international development, etc.), while others are of religious beliefs, most notably the Unitarian Christian Association and the Unitarian Earth Spirit Network.

==Officers==
The national structure of British Unitarians is headed by an elected president, who holds office for one year. This officer is the figurehead leader of the organisation. Day-to-day administration is in the hands of an Executive Committee, which is led by a Convenor, assisted by an Honorary Treasurer, a General Secretary (sometimes called Chief Officer), and other Executive Committee members.

At the regional level, British Unitarianism is grouped into Districts. There are currently 13 Districts in England, two in Wales, and one in Scotland. Each District has a similar structure to that at national level, with a President and a District Executive Committee. Some Districts appoint a District Minister.

Local congregations vary in size, structure, and practice, but there is a requirement for each congregation to have some form of established and formal leadership. In most cases this will include a local Council and usually also a Unitarian minister.

<doc id="218478" wikidata="Q711617" url="?curid=218478" title="Irving Klaw">
<text>Irving Klaw (November 9, 1910 – September 3, 1966), self-named the &quot;Pin-up King&quot;, was an influential American merchant of sexploitation, fetish, and Hollywood glamour pin-up photographs and films. Like his predecessor, Charles Guyette, who was also a merchant of fetish-themed photographs, Klaw was not a photographer, but a merchandiser of fetish art imagery and films. He would commission fetish art (with models like Bettie Page, June King, Joan Rydell, Jackie Miller, et al.) and sponsor illustrative artists (like Eric Stanton, Gene Bilbrew, and many others), and indirectly promote the legacy of Charles Guyette and John Willie. Irving Klaw is a central figure in what fetish art historian Richard Pérez Seves has designated as the &quot;Bizarre Underground,&quot; the pre-1970 fetish art years.

==Early life==
Klaw was born on November 9, 1910, in Brooklyn, New York, to a BMT subway conductor, his father
died when Irving was in high school. His divorce-combined family included three boys and three girls.&lt;ref name=&quot;dr/Sex-Klaw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Klaw is a step-sister.

==Movie Star News==
Klaw&#x27;s business, which eventually became Movie Star News, began in 1938 when he and his sister Paula opened a struggling basement level used bookstore at 209 E. 14th St. in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha/997042-1450.s&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After he discovered teenagers were frequently tearing out photos from his movie magazines, he switched to selling movie star stills and lobby photo cards which sold so well he stopped selling books and moved the store from the basement to the street-level storefront. Business thrived, and the self-named &quot;Pin-Up King&quot; moved to 212 E. 14th St., as &quot;Irving Klaw&#x27;s Pin-Up Photo&quot;, eventually taking the name &quot;Movie Star News&quot;. Klaw also had a brisk international mail-order business selling cheesecake photos and Hollywood glamour pin-ups.

==Fetish art==
In 1948, a collector/enthusiast known as Little John &quot;inspired/sponsored Klaw&#x27;s full-blown entry into the fetish art business.&quot; Irving Klaw was also influenced by magazine publisher Robert Harrison. Early Klaw fetish models included Harrison models Barbara Leslie, Vicky Hayes, Joan &quot;Eve&quot; Rydell, Lili Dawn, Shirley &quot;Cici&quot; Maitland, Kevin Daley, Roz Greenwood, and Bettie Page.

Inspired by John Willie, Klaw also commissioned and distributed illustrated adventure/bondage chapter serials by fetish artists Eric Stanton, Gene Bilbrew, Adolfo Ruiz, and others.

==Burlesque features and bondage film-loops==
Irving Klaw had this loft and he was acquainted with an awful lot of strippers... His mode of operation was that he would take these separate segments, one with me, and one with Betty (Bettie) Page, and all these other girls, then he would splice these together until he had enough time, fifty minutes or whatever, and make what he would call a full picture...a bunch of segments of ten or twelve different girls doing their various acts... He&#x27;d piece them together in several different movies
:— Lili St. Cyr

After the surprise success of the B-movie &quot;Striporama&quot;, a 1953 burlesque revue with famous striptease artists and model Bettie Page, Klaw quickly duplicated the formula and directed his own burlesque features. Using a professional camera crew and richly saturated Eastman color filmstock, &quot;Varietease&quot; (1954) and &quot;Teaserama&quot; (1955) featured Lili St. Cyr, Tempest Storm, and Bettie Page (and were released on DVD in the U.S. in 2000). He produced and directed a third film in 1956, &quot;Buxom Beautease&quot;, without Page.

Also during this period, Klaw set up weekend home-movie sessions where he produced scores of silent 8 mm and 16 mm black-and-white film loops. These featured striptease acts and an assortment of fetishistic subjects based on special requests from his clientele. Titles such as &quot;Riding the Human Pony Girl&quot;, &quot;Bondage in Leather Harness&quot;, and &quot;Booted Amazon Fights Again&quot; depicted women in skimpy lingerie and high heels engaging in elaborate bondage, cat-fights, spanking, and slave training. Nearly all of these featurettes were shot on a single, sparsely decorated set, either in the studio above Movie Star News or at a nearby loft space. At least two films with Bettie Page (&quot;Rumble Seat Bondage&quot; and &quot;Jungle Girl Tied to Trees&quot;) were shot outdoors at secluded locations.

Still photos taken during the sessions were also sold at the store and in the bi-annual mail-order catalog &quot;Cartoon and Model Parade&quot;.

==Censorship and early retirement==

In 1956, Abe McGregor Goff, general counsel of the Post Office Department, denied Klaw use of the U.S. mails, insisting he was &quot;one of the nation’s largest dealers in pornographic material&quot;.

In 1956, Klaw&#x27;s sister, Mrs. Fanny Cronin, was arrested for operating a $2 million New Jersey &quot;pornographic films and photos mill&quot;.

The Kefauver Hearings of the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency in 1957 marked the beginning of the end of Irving Klaw&#x27;s mail-order fetish art business in New York. The investigation tried to link pornography to juvenile delinquency. The McCarthy-style hearings branded Klaw as a degenerate pornographer and ushered in a new wave of media censorship. Bettie Page was also summoned to the hearings but was never called to testify (parts of the hearings are recreated in the film &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;). She retired from modeling soon afterwards.
Because of the political, social and legal pressures he faced, Klaw closed his storefront business and burned many of his negatives. It is estimated that more than 80% of the negatives were destroyed. However, his sister Paula secretly kept some of the better images, which can be seen today.

==Final years==

After the Senate hearings and the ensuing legal difficulties with state authorities, Klaw was barred from continuing his business in New York. Shortly thereafter he moved his Nutrix Publishing Company, along with the associated Satellite Publications (Stanley Malkin &amp; Pat Martini), to an office building in Jersey City, New Jersey. Both companies sold similar fetish-oriented photos and magazines.

To further avoid prosecution, Klaw&#x27;s Nutrix publishing imprint was restricted to a mail-order-only business. For several years he published a number of small illustrated bondage/fetish photo-booklets. Titles such as &quot;Girl Psycho Handled with Restraint&quot; (1960), which includes old photos of Bettie Page, &quot;Girls Punishment at School of Discipline&quot; (1962), &quot;Tortured Models in the Wax Exhibit&quot; (1962), and &quot;Paddled Severely During Sorority Initiation&quot; (1963) are typical examples. Eventually he sold this business to Ed Mishkin, who changed the company name from Nutrix to Mutrix, adding the first initial of his last name.

Klaw relocated to Florida where he briefly returned to filmmaking in 1963, producing two films: Larry Wolk&#x27;s &quot;Intimate Diary of an Artist&#x27;s Model&quot; and &quot;Nature&#x27;s Sweethearts&quot;, co-directing the latter. Photographer Bunny Yeager worked closely with him during this period. She had multiple duties on these films, including casting, writing dialog, etc. Unlike his previous movies, both pictures were exploitation &quot;nudie cuties&quot; that featured a number of topless women. Irving continued to photograph bondage in Miami as well, with models like Maria Stinger.

In 1963, Robert F. Kennedy led the campaign to convict Klaw and his brother-in-law, Jack Kramer, of conspiracy to send pornographic materials through the U.S. mail.

Irving Klaw died on September 3, 1966 from complications of untreated appendicitis. He was survived by two sons, Arthur and Jeffrey. His nephew Ira Kramer, son of Paula and Jack Kramer, took over the family business, Movie Star News, which was located on 18th Street but closed in 2012, and relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada.

Klaw was portrayed by Dukey Flyswatter in the 2004 biographical film &quot;Bettie Page: Dark Angel&quot; and by Chris Bauer in the 2005 film &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;.

==Legacy==
Due to the revival of interest in Bettie Page that began in the 1980s, various compilations of Klaw&#x27;s films have been released on video and DVD. Background music and narration were added to the silent fetish loops for the two-volume video &quot;Irving Klaw Bondage Classics&quot; (1984) by London Enterprises.

In 2005, Cult Epics released both volumes on one DVD under the title &quot;Bettie Page: Bondage Queen.&quot; Also in 2005, Cult Epics put out &quot;Bettie Page: Pin Up Queen&quot;, a DVD compilation of her burlesque performances from &quot;Striporama&quot;, &quot;Varietease&quot; and &quot;Teaserama&quot;, plus six black-and-white film loops of dancing and a cat-fight.

More of Klaw&#x27;s bondage film reels, including one with Bettie Page, are in DVD format in &quot;Bizarro Sex Loops&quot; (Volumes 4 and 20). These are compilations of vintage fetish films released by Something Weird Video (2008).

In 2012 Klaw was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

<text>Edward Max Nicholson (12 July 1904 – 26 April 2003) was a pioneering environmentalist, ornithologist and internationalist, and a founder of the World Wildlife Fund.

==Early life==
Max Nicholson, as he was known to all, was born in Kilternan, Ireland, to English parents. His family moved to England in 1910, settling in Staines. He became interested in natural history after a visit to the natural history museum and later took to birdwatching, beginning to maintain a list of birds seen from 1913.

He was educated at Sedbergh School in Cumbria and then Hertford College, Oxford from 1926, winning scholarships to both. At Oxford, he read history and visited Greenland and British Guiana as a founder member of the Oxford University Exploration Club. At Oxford, he organized bird counts and censuses on the University&#x27;s farm at Sanford. In 1928, Nicholson created and managed the first national birdwatch survey, a survey of the grey heron.

==Ornithology and conservation==
Nicholson already had published his first work in 1926, &quot;Birds in England&quot;, and had three similar books published soon after. In
&quot;The Art of Bird-Watching&quot; (1931), he discussed the potential of co-operative birdwatching to inform the conservation debate. This led, in 1932, to the foundation of the British Trust for Ornithology, of which he was the first treasurer and later chairman (1947–1949). In 1947–1948, with the then director general of the United Nations&#x27; scientific and education organisation UNESCO, Julian Huxley, he was involved in forming the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUPN) (now International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)).

In 1949, he oversaw Part 3 of The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 which established the Nature Conservancy, a British state research council for natural sciences and &#x27;biological service&#x27;, and allowed for the legal protection of national nature reserves and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). He replaced Captain Cyril Diver as Director General of the Nature Conservancy in 1952, serving until 1966, just after the Conservancy lost its independent status. During his leadership, the Conservancy established itself as a research and management body that promoted ecology as having broad relevance and application to land use decision-making and management. Monks Wood Experimental Station, which helped set up, was perhaps the first to examine the effect of toxic chemicals on wildlife.

In 1952, while in Baluchistan, he contracted polio, which left him with a limp. In 1961, Nicholson, together with Victor Stolan, Sir Peter Scott and Guy Mountfort, formed the organising group that created the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) (now the World Wide Fund for Nature). He was also a founder of the International Institute for Environment and Development. In 1966, he set up and headed environmental firm Land Use Consultants (LUC), remaining with them until 1989. One of LUC&#x27;s first reports was &#x27;Parkways in principle and Practice&#x27; (1967), in which Nicholson urged that &quot;the problems of recreation, traffic, environmental quality and conservation should be studied together . .&quot;, to form a category of parkways in Britain.

From 1951 to 1960, he was the senior editor of &quot;British Birds&quot; and was the chief editor of &quot;The Birds of the Western Palearctic&quot; (&quot;BWP&quot;, 1977–1994, OUP) from 1965 to 1992. He was the only author to stay with the project from start to end, personally writing the habitat sections of all species in the nine volumes. In 1971, he gave the Witherby Memorial Lecture on the subject of Geograms.

In 1976, he was an instrumental part of the setting up of Britain&#x27;s first urban ecology park and the Trust for Urban Ecology. In 1978, Nicholson was instrumental in founding the ENDS Report which became a highly influential journal for environmental policy specialists. He was President of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds from 1980 to 1985, helped set up the New Renaissance Group and was a trustee of Earthwatch Europe. In 1995, he appeared as a guest on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

He was awarded the Busk Medal by the Royal Geographical Society in 1990.

==Other activities==
Nicholson&#x27;s 1931 essay &quot;A National Plan for Britain&quot; led to the formation of the influential policy think tank Political and Economic Planning (PEP), now the Policy Studies Institute. Nicholson had strong ideas on how a country should be run and wrote a book &quot;The System&quot;.

Nicholson joined the civil service in 1940, during World War II working for the Ministry of Shipping, then the Ministry of War Transport, attending conferences at Quebec and Cairo, and was with Winston Churchill at the post-war peace conferences at Yalta and Potsdam. From 1945 until 1952, he was private secretary to Herbert Morrison, the Deputy Prime Minister. He also chaired the committee for 1951&#x27;s Festival of Britain. During the war years, he was in charge of organizing shipping operations and convoys across the Atlantic. He was involved in the planning of &quot;Operation Overlord&quot;, the invasion of Europe. For his services he was awarded the CVO and CB.

==Personal life==
Nicholson married Mary Crawford in 1932 and they had two children, Piers and Tom. The marriage was dissolved in 1964 and Crawford died in 1995. Nicholson then married Marie Mauerhofer (known as Toni) in 1965; they had one child, a son, David. She died in 2002. Max Nicholson died in 2003, aged 98.

== Legacy ==

Every year on Nicholson&#x27;s birthday, 12 July, a group of people walk a section of the Jubilee Walkway in London to celebrate his work in establishing the route. Two memorial sundials have been put in place in memory of Nicholson - one by the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust at the WWT London Wetland Centre in Barnes, London, and another at Sedbergh School in Cumbria, where Nicholson went to school.

<doc id="218484" wikidata="Q114614" url="?curid=218484" title="Bitterfeld (district)">
<text>Bitterfeld was a district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the city of Dessau, the district of Wittenberg, Delitzsch (Saxony) and the districts of Saalkreis and Köthen.

== History ==
The district was a swampy and unpopulated area in the early Middle Ages. In the 12th century Flemish settlers helped to drain the swamps. In that time Bitterfeld was known as &quot;the Flemish town&quot; in the region. The present district is roughly identical with the old county of Brehna, which ruled the area from the 10th to the 13th century. Later the region became a part of Saxony.

When Prussia gained the northern parts of Saxony (including the lands around Bitterfeld), the district of Bitterfeld was established. After the dissolution of Anhalt some places in the north were added to the district.

The East German government tried to establish a socialistic industrial centre in the Bitterfeld region. The city of Bitterfeld and the entire district were infamous for polluted air, poisoned rivers and devastated landscape. After the German reunification there have been measures to change these conditions. Today the power plants work with modern filters, and sewage works greatly improve the water conditions.

During the Kreisreform 2007 the district was merged with Köthen and a large part of Anhalt-Zerbst into the new district Anhalt-Bitterfeld.

== Geography ==
The Mulde River crossed the district from south to north.

<doc id="218489" wikidata="Q657907" url="?curid=218489" title="Tolstoyan movement">
<text>The Tolstoyan movement is a social movement based on the philosophical and religious views of Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910). Tolstoy&#x27;s views were formed by rigorous study of the ministry of Jesus, particularly the Sermon on the Mount.

Tolstoy expressed &quot;great joy&quot; that groups of people &quot;have been springing up, not only in Russia but in various parts of Europe, who are in complete agreement with our views.&quot; However, the author also thought it was a mistake to create a specific movement or doctrine after him, urging individuals to listen to their own conscience rather than blindly follow his. In regard to a letter he received from an adherent, he wrote:

==Beliefs and practices==

Tolstoyans (, &quot;Tolstovtsy&quot;) identify themselves as Christians, but do not generally belong to an institutional Church. Tolstoy was a harsh critic of the Russian Orthodox Church, leading to his excommunication in 1901. Tolstoyans tend to focus more on following the teachings of Jesus, rather than on his miracles or divinity. They attempt to live an ascetic and simple life, preferring to be vegetarian, non-smoking, teetotal and chaste. Tolstoyans are considered Christian pacifists and advocate nonresistance in all circumstances. Tolstoy&#x27;s understanding of what it means to be Christian was defined by the Sermon on the Mount and summed up in five simple propositions:
# Love your enemies
# Do not be angry
# Do not fight evil with evil, but return evil with good (an interpretation of turning the other cheek)
# Do not lust
# Do not take oaths.

They do not support or participate in the government which they consider immoral, violent and corrupt. Tolstoy rejected the state (as it only exists on the basis of physical force) and all institutions that are derived from it – the police, law courts and army. Thus, many now regard them as Christian anarchists. Historically, Tolstoy&#x27;s ideas have had some influence on anarchist thought, specifically on anarcho-pacifism. They were also cited as an inspiration by Mahatma Gandhi in the formation of his own philosophy of nonviolence from both Jainism and Hinduism.

Leon Trotsky summed up Tolstoy&#x27;s social philosophy, on the basis of his writings, in five &quot;programmatic theses&quot;:

# &quot;It is not some kind of iron sociologic laws that produce the enslavement of peoples, but legal codes.&quot;
# &quot;Modern slavery rests on three statutes: those on land, taxes and property.&quot;
# &quot;Not alone the Russian state but every state is an institution for committing, by violence and with impunity the most horrible crimes.&quot;
# &quot;Genuine social progress is attained only through the religious and moral self-perfection of individuals&quot;.
# &quot;To get rid of states it is not necessary to fight against them with external means. All that is needed is not to take part in them and not to support them.&quot;

===Vegetarianism===

The vegetarian movement started in Europe in the 19th century. The first Vegetarian Society was founded in Manchester in 1847. Tolstoy became a prominent influence on the movement. He became vegetarian, along with his two daughters, in 1885. His relevant essay &quot;The First Step&quot; (1891), and others were promoted by vegetarian societies internationally.

His vegetarianism was part of a Christian philosophy of non-violence that he developed. At that time, vegetarian restaurants were few, and they often served as meeting spaces for Tolstoyans, and other social reformers. The movement was mostly ovo-lacto vegetarian at the time. However, abstinence from meat eating was not an obligatory part of the philosophy of the Tolstoyan movement as some preferred to eat meat. Historian Charlotte Alston has written that &quot;from meat eating to fruitarianism, the movement embraced and tolerated a wide variety of positions&quot;.

Notable vegetarian Tolstoyans who considered vegetarianism to be a central part of their belief system included Felix Ortt president of the Dutch Vegetarian Society and Arthur St. John of the Croydon Brotherhood Church.

==Groups and colonies==

===Africa===

Mohandas Karamchand (later Mahatma) Gandhi set up a cooperative colony called Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg, South Africa, having been inspired by Tolstoy&#x27;s ideas. The colony comprising was funded by the Gandhian Hermann Kallenbach and placed at the disposal of the satyagrahis from 1910.

===America===
Ernest Howard Crosby was a notable Tolstoyan in the United States. He was a supporter of the Christian Commonwealth Colony in Columbus, Georgia, which was established in 1896 by a number of Christian socialists and comprised . The residents were also influenced by the views of Henry George and Edward Bellamy.

===Europe===
In Russia censorship meant that many of Tolstoy&#x27;s non-fiction works in the 1880s and 1890s were published abroad first, either in Russian or in translation, delaying the author&#x27;s influence in his country of birth. However, with Vladimir Chertkov (1854–1936) as a key promoter of Tolstoy&#x27;s ideas, a movement started over the 1890s. The movement continued to grow after the writer&#x27;s death and was at its strongest in the years immediately following the revolutions of 1917 with agricultural communities established in the provinces of Smolensk, Tver, Samara, Kursk, Perm and Kiev. The Tolstoyan communities that proliferated between 1917 and 1921 were eventually wiped out or stripped of their independence as collectivisation and ideological purges got under way in the late 1920s. Colonies, such as the Life and Labor Commune, relocated to Siberia to avoid being liquidated. Several Tolstoyan leaders, including Yakov Dragunovsky (1886–1937), were put on trial and then sent to the Gulag prison camps.

In England John Coleman Kenworthy of the Brotherhood Church established a colony at Purleigh, Essex in 1896. This community closed a few years later but its residents spawned the Whiteway Colony in Gloucestershire and Stapleton Colony in Yorkshire, both of which are still going today. Although given Whiteway soon abandoned Tolstoy&#x27;s principles, it has been regarded by many, including Gandhi who visited in 1909, as a failed Tolstoyan experiment.

Johannes van der Veer was the key figure in the Dutch Tolstoyan movement, and Tolstoy directly addressed van der Veer&#x27;s anti-war stances in an 1896 essay. In the Netherlands two colonies were started, a short-lived one at Bussum in North Holland and a more successful one at nearby Blaricum. The reasons attributed to the failure of Tolstoyan communities across Europe have included the personal incompatibility of the participants and a general lack of practical agricultural experience.

==Prominent followers==
One of the prominent followers of Tolstoy was the celebrated philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. His interest in Tolstoy began in the First World War after he read his book, &quot;The Gospel in Brief&quot;. He carried this book with him everywhere and recommended it to others.

In particular, the pacifism of Tolstoy was very influential. Alexander Fodor wrote:

Another prominent follower of Tolstoy&#x27;s teachings was Dorothy Day, an American social activist, and a founder of the pacifist Catholic Worker Movement.

<doc id="218492" wikidata="Q1140080" url="?curid=218492" title="Farthing (British coin)">
<text>The farthing (from Old English &quot;fēorðing&quot;, from &quot;fēorða&quot;, a fourth) was a British coin worth one quarter of a penny, or of a pound sterling. Initially minted in copper, and then in bronze, it replaced the earlier English farthing. Between 1860 and 1971, the farthing&#x27;s purchasing power ranged between 12p and 0.2p in 2017 values.

The farthing&#x27;s reverse bore an image of Britannia until 1937, when a wren was introduced. As with all British coins, the obverse bore the image of the reigning monarch. The farthing ceased to be legal tender in the United Kingdom on 1 January 1961. 

==History==
A British copper farthing succeeded the English farthing after England and Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, although not immediately. Under Queen Anne, a small number of pattern farthings were struck, but none for circulation, as so many English farthings from previous reigns were still available. Some British copper farthings were struck in the reigns of George I and George II. By the accession of George III, in 1760, many counterfeits were in circulation, and the Royal Mint stopped minting copper coins in 1775. The next farthings were the first struck by steam power, in 1799 by Matthew Boulton at his Soho Mint, under licence. Boulton coined more in 1806, and the Royal Mint resumed production in 1821. The farthing was struck regularly under George IV and William IV, by then with a design very like a smaller version of the penny.

Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. three shillings and six pence (3/6d.), pronounced &quot;three and six&quot; or &quot;three and sixpence&quot;. Values of less than a shilling were simply written in pence, e.g. (8d.), pronounced &quot;eightpence&quot;. A price with a farthing in it would be written like this: (2d.), pronounced &quot;twopence [or tuppence] farthing&quot;, or (1/3d.), pronounced &quot;one and threepence [or thruppence] farthing&quot; or (19/11), pronounced &quot;nineteen and eleven three farthing(s)&quot;. 19/11 was a value used to make goods seem &quot;significantly&quot; cheaper than £1, usage similar to the modern £0.99 (which is also the approximate face value in 2021 of 19/11 in 1961, the year when the farthing was withdrawn from circulation).

The first bronze farthings were struck in 1860, in the reign of Queen Victoria, with a new reverse designed by Leonard Charles Wyon. This shows a seated Britannia, holding a trident, with the word above. Between 1860 and 1895 there is a lighthouse to Britannia&#x27;s left and a ship to her right. Various minor adjustments were made over the years to the level of the sea around Britannia and the angle of her trident. Some issues feature toothed edges to the coin, while others feature beading.

After 1860, seven different obverses were used. Edward VII, George V, George VI and Elizabeth II each had a single obverse for the farthings produced during their respective reigns. Over the long reign of Queen Victoria, two different obverses were used. The farthing of 1860 carried the so-called &quot;bun head&quot;, or &quot;draped bust&quot; of Queen Victoria on the obverse. The inscription around the bust read (abbreviated Latin: Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith). This was replaced in 1895 by the &quot;old head&quot;, or &quot;veiled bust&quot;. The inscription on these coins read (Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith empress of India).

Farthings issued during the reign of Edward VII feature his likeness and bear the inscription (Edward VII by the grace of God king of all Britons defender of the faith emperor of India). Similarly, those issued during the reign of George V feature his likeness and bear the inscription (George V by the grace of God king of all Britons defender of the faith emperor of India).

A farthing of King Edward VIII (reigned 1936) does exist, dated 1937, but technically it is a pattern coin, one produced for official approval, which it was due to receive at about the time that the King abdicated, and in the event no farthings bearing his likeness were ever issued. The pattern has a left-facing portrait of the king, who considered this to be his best side, and consequently broke the tradition of alternating the direction in which the monarch faces on coins — some viewed this as indicating bad luck for the reign; the inscription on the obverse is (Edward VIII by the grace of God king of all Britons defender of the faith emperor of India).

One feature of the pattern farthing of Edward VIII was a redesigned reverse displaying the wren, one of Britain&#x27;s smallest birds. From 1937 this appeared on the regular-issue farthings of George VI and was continued on the farthings of Elizabeth II until the last issue in 1956.

George VI coins feature the inscription (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britons defender of the faith emperor of India) before 1949, and (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britons defender of the faith) thereafter. Unlike the penny, farthings were minted throughout the early reign of Elizabeth II, bearing the inscription (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all Britons defender of the faith) in 1953, and (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen defender of the faith) thereafter.

<doc id="218511" wikidata="Q686422" url="?curid=218511" title="Johann Gottfried Piefke">
<text>Johann Gottfried Piefke (9 September 1817 – 25 January 1884) was a German band leader, (&quot;Kapellmeister&quot;) and composer of military music.

Piefke was born in Schwerin an der Warthe, Prussia (now Skwierzyna, Poland). In the 1850s, he was band leader for the 8th Infantry Regiment in Berlin. His famous marches include &quot;Preußens Gloria&quot;, &quot;Düppeler Schanzen-Marsch&quot; and the &quot;Königgrätzer Marsch&quot; – the latter composed after the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866, the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War). He arranged Franz Liszt&#x27;s symphonic poem – &quot;Tasso&quot; for military band and may also have similarly arranged some of Liszt&#x27;s marches. He died in Frankfurt an der Oder.

Piefke also wrote:
* &quot;Pochhammer Marsch&quot;
* &quot;Siegesmarsch&quot;
* &quot;Gitana Marsch&quot;
* &quot;Margarethen Marsch&quot;
* &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Siegesmarsch&quot;
* &quot;Der Alsenströmer&quot;, a march commemorating the Battle of Als during the Second Schleswig War.
* &quot;Der Lymfjordströmer&quot;, another march commemorating the Danish War.

==Honors==
Piefke received the following medals:
*Düppeler-Sturmkreuz, 1864
*Golden Medal of the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, 1865
*Royal Order of the House of Hohenzollern, 1869
*Iron Cross Second Class, 1870
*Prussian Crown Order, 1880

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;Piefke&quot; persists as a derogatory nickname for Germans in Austria.
* Piefke&#x27;s &quot;Königgrätzer Marsch&quot; can be heard playing during the book burning scene in the film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. It was one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s favorite marches and was often played during his public appearances.

<text>Leo Stanley Crane (September 7, 1915 – July 15, 2003) was a railroad executive who was CEO of Southern Railway. Trained as a chemical engineer, Crane was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1978. After retiring from Southern Railway, he worked for Conrail where he later endowed the L. Stanley Crane Chair of engineering in applied sciences at his alma mater, George Washington University.

== Career ==
He graduated from The George Washington University with a chemical engineering degree in 1938. He began his career with Southern Railway, and worked for the railroad, except for a stint from 1959 to 1961 with the Pennsylvania Railroad, until reaching the company&#x27;s mandatory retirement age in 1980. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1978.

Crane went to Conrail in 1981 after a distinguished career that had seen him rise to the position of CEO at the Southern Railway.

=== With Conrail ===
Crane went to Conrail in 1981, where he presided over the turnaround of the deficit-plagued railroad, which began turning a profit as a result of Staggers Act freedoms and its own managerial improvements under his leadership. While the Staggers Act helped immensely in allowing all railroads to more easily abandon unprofitable rail lines and set their own freight rates, it was under Crane&#x27;s leadership that Conrail truly became a profitable operation. In the two years after he took office in 1981 he shed 4,400 miles from the Conrail system, which accounted for only 1% of the railroad&#x27;s overall traffic and 2% of its profits while saving it millions of dollars in maintenance costs.

In 1983, Crane began a five-year battle with Transportation Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole to hold onto Conrail. Crane was an outspoken critic of Dole&#x27;s proposal to sell the rail system to Norfolk Southern Corporation, and fought for a public stock offering to return the railroad to the private sector. In November 1986, Crane delivered a check for $200 million to President Ronald Reagan. By that spring, Conrail paid an additional $100 million to the government. In March 1987, the government sold Conrail in a public stock offering. Investors on the New York Stock Exchange quickly snapped up 58,750,000 shares of Conrail; the sale netted $1.58 billion. Crane later saw Conrail sold to two rival bidders, Norfolk Southern and CSX, for more than $10 billion (five times the price for which the Reagan Administration had been willing to sell the railroad).

In 1989, Conrail established the &quot;L. Stanley Crane chair professorship&quot; in the College of Engineering at The George Washington University. The endowed L. Stanley Crane professorship of engineering in applied science was first held by GWU&#x27;s former engineering dean Harold Liebowitz (1989-1991) and then by the chair of Computer Science Roger H. Lang (1991–present).
was amongst the first three fellows elected to the Society of Engineering Science in 1975 together with Ahmed Cemal Eringen and Warren P. Mason.

== Personal life ==
In 1962, Crane married Jean Eward. They had twins, Pamela and Penelope. That marriage ended in divorce in 1976. Jean Crane died in 1998. Stanley Crane was married to Joan McCoy from 1976 to 1999. He died of pneumonia on July 15, 2003, at a hospice in Boynton Beach, Florida. He was 87. Crane is buried in the Fort Lincoln Cemetery, Maryland.

<text>Reflection Eternal is an American hip hop duo composed of emcee Talib Kweli and producer Hi-Tek. They released their first album, &quot;Train of Thought&quot;, in 2000. They have since released a mixtape, &quot;The RE: Union&quot;, in late December 2009, and their second album &quot;Revolutions Per Minute&quot; was released May 18, 2010.

==History==
The duo of Talib Kweli and Hi-Tek met in Tek&#x27;s native Cincinnati, following the release of the Hi-Tek/Mood collaboration &quot;Hustle on the Side&quot;. Kweli and Hi-Tek made their first official collaboration in 1997 on Mood&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Doom&quot;, on the track &quot;Industry Lies&quot;. That same year, the two formed as Reflection Eternal, and signed to upstart underground hip hop label Rawkus Records. The tracks from their debut single, &quot;Fortified Live&quot; b/w &quot;2000 Seasons&quot;, were included on the Rawkus Records compilation &quot;Soundbombing&quot; in October 1997. In 1998, Kweli and his high school friend, fellow Rawkus Records artist Mos Def, formed the duo Black Star, and released their first album, &quot;Black Star&quot;, to rave reviews. Hi-Tek provided production for a number of songs on the album, including the singles &quot;Definition&quot; and &quot;Respiration&quot;. The album put the three at the forefront of an underground hip hop scene that appeared at the time to be flagging against the influence of the &quot;Jiggy&quot; era of hip-hop, and was followed by a number of acclaimed collaborations and albums. Kweli and Hi-Tek reconnected in 2000 for the release of their debut album, &quot;Train of Thought&quot;. Though highly acclaimed, the release did not receive a significant amount of commercial attention, despite the success of the rap hits &quot;Move Somethin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;The Blast&quot;.

Following the &quot;Train of Thought&quot; album, the duo split for solo projects, beginning with Hi-Tek&#x27;s &quot;Hi-Teknology&quot;, released in 2001, on which Kweli appeared. The album didn&#x27;t receive as much attention or as many sales as &quot;Train of Thought&quot;, though the single &quot;Round &amp; Round&quot; became a crossover hit in 2002. Kweli released his first solo album, &quot;Quality&quot;, in late 2002. In a 2002 interview he also stated that another Reflection Eternal and Black Star album would be released. Hi-Tek was not involved with the project&#x27;s production, instead featuring beats from artists like Kanye West, DJ Scratch, DJ Quik, Ayatollah and J Dilla. The Kanye West-produced single &quot;Get By&quot; became Kweli&#x27;s biggest success, charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 2003. Kweli&#x27;s second solo album, 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Beautiful Struggle&quot;, saw the duo working together once again, with three tracks produced by Hi-Tek. Kweli released his next album, &quot;Ear Drum&quot;, in 2007, featuring production from Tek; Hi-Tek released the follow-up to his debut, &quot;Hi-Teknology 2: The Chip&quot;, in 2006 and his third album, &quot;Hi-Teknology 3: The Underground&quot;, in 2007, both on Babygrande Records and both featuring appearances by Kweli.

The duo announced that another Reflection Eternal album was in the works in 2008. They named their second album &quot;Revolutions Per Minute&quot;. 
They played a live reunion gig in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on September 20, 2009. In the same year Bootsy Collins collaborated with Talib Kweli and Hi-Tek on the track &quot;Internet Connection&quot;. also a track &quot;Back Again&quot; has been released along with video. They also collaborated with J. Cole, Mos Def, and Jay Electronica on the track &quot;Just Begun&quot;. These three songs were released in a mixtape on January 1, 2010, called &quot;The Re:Union&quot; which received positive fanbase feedback. Their second album &quot;Revolutions Per Minute&quot; was released on May 18, 2010, with similar praise as their debut album. It spawned 3 singles: &quot;In This World&quot;, &quot;Strangers (Paranoid)&quot; featuring former UGK member Bun B, and &quot;Midnight Hour&quot; featuring Atlantic recording artist Estelle.

<text>The Daurian jackdaw (Coloeus dauuricus) is a bird in the crow family, Corvidae, native to eastern Asia. It is closely related to the western jackdaw. The name derives from the Dauria region of eastern Russia.

==Description==
At about in length, the Daurian jackdaw is about the same size as or slightly smaller than the western jackdaw, with the same proportions and identical habits. The principal difference lies in the plumage; many but not all adults have large areas of creamy white on the lower parts extending up around the neck as a broad collar. The head, throat, wings, and tail are glossy black and the ear coverts are grizzled grey. Darker adults and young birds resemble western jackdaws, though Daurian jackdaws have black irises, unlike the distinctive grey-white irises of the Eurasian jackdaw. The only other pied corvid species inhabiting the same region is the Chinese collared crow (&quot;Corvus torquatus&quot;), but as this is a much larger bird (about the same size or slightly larger than the carrion crow), confusion is unlikely to occur.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Daurian jackdaw ranges from the southern part of eastern Siberia, south to Mongolia and throughout much of China. In the north of its range it migrates further south during the winter. It is a scarce winter visitor to Korea, a rare annual winter visitor to Japan, and a vagrant to Taiwan. There are a few records from Western Europe. It inhabits open woodland, river valleys, and open hills and mountains.

==Behaviour==
It is a sociable species often found in association with rooks.

===Feeding===
The food is similar to that of the western jackdaw and includes cultivated grains, insects, berries, eggs, carrion, and faeces.

===Breeding===

The species will nest in trees where suitable cavities cannot be found, though tree hollows, rock openings and ruined buildings are still favoured. The eggs are similar to those of the western jackdaw.

<text>Procyon is a genus of nocturnal mammals comprising three species commonly known as raccoons in the family Procyonidae. The most familiar species, the common raccoon (&quot;P. lotor&quot;), is often known simply as &quot;the&quot; raccoon, as the two other raccoon species in the genus are native only to the tropics and are less well known. Genetic studies have shown that the closest relatives of raccoons are the ring-tailed cats and cacomistles of genus &quot;Bassariscus&quot;, from which they diverged about 10 million years ago.

==General attributes==
Raccoons are unusual, for their thumbs (though not ) enable them to open many closed containers (such as garbage cans and doors). They are omnivores with a reputation for being clever and mischievous; their intelligence and dexterity equip them to survive in a wide range of environments and are one of the few medium-to-large-sized animals that have enlarged their range since human encroachment began (another is the coyote). Raccoon hindfeet are plantigrade similar to those of humans and bears. Raccoons are sometimes considered vermin or a nuisance. They have readily adapted to urban environments (compare urban opossums, skunks and foxes), scavenging garbage bins and other food sources.

Although there is some variation depending on species, raccoons range from in length (including the tail) and weigh between . The raccoon&#x27;s tail ranges from in length. Male raccoons are generally larger than females. A baby raccoon is called a kit.

Raccoons can live up to 16 years in the wild, though most do not make it through their second year. A raccoon that survives past its youth will live an average of five years. Primary causes of mortality include humans (hunting, trapping, cars) and malnutrition.

==Species==

There are three extant species of raccoon: 
Some raccoons once considered as separate species are now thought to be the same as or subspecies of the common raccoon, including the Barbados raccoon (&quot;P. gloveralleni&quot;), Nassau raccoon (&quot;P. maynardi&quot;), Guadeloupe raccoon (&quot;P. minor&quot;), and Tres Marias raccoon (&quot;P. insularis&quot;) (Helgen and Wilson 2005). &quot;Procyon brachyurus&quot; was described from captive specimens; its identity is undeterminable as the remains of the two animals assigned to this taxon cannot be located and may have been lost.
==Nomenclature==
The word &quot;raccoon&quot; is derived from the Algonquian word , &quot;he who scratches with his hands&quot;. Spanish-speaking colonists similarly adopted their term, , from the Nahuatl word for the animal, meaning roughly &quot;that which has hands&quot;.

The genus name, &quot;Procyon&quot;, comes from the Greek for &quot;before the dog&quot;; this term is also used for the star Procyon of the constellation Canis Minor.

Raccoons are today understood to have a relatively loose evolutionary relationship with bears, which was nonetheless seen as significant by the early taxonomists; Carl Linnaeus initially placed the raccoon in the genus &quot;Ursus&quot;. In many languages, the raccoon is named for its characteristic dousing behavior in conjunction with that language&#x27;s term for &quot;bear&quot;: in German, in Hungarian, in Danish and Norwegian, in Swedish, in Dutch, in Estonian and in Finnish, () in Japanese, in Italian, () in Chinese and () in Bulgarian all mean &quot;washing bear&quot;. One exception is Russian, where raccoon is named () due to similarity between raccoon and genet furs. However, the full name of the common raccoon in Russian is also water-related: it is called (), which means &quot;rinsing raccoon&quot;.

In some cases, the &quot;washing&quot; descriptor is applied only to the common raccoon species: for example, in French the common raccoon is called or &quot;washing rat&quot;, while its Linnaean binomial is &quot;Procyon lotor&quot; or, roughly, &quot;washing pre-dog&quot;. In contrast, the crab-eating raccoon is &quot;little crab-catching rat&quot; () and &quot;crab-eating pre-dog&quot; (&quot;Procyon cancrivorus&quot;) in French and Latin, respectively.

<text>Racoon are a Dutch pop rock band from Goes, Zeeland, formed in 1997. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of vocalist Bart van der Weide, guitarist Dennis Huige, bassist Maarten van Damme and drummer Paul Bukkens. Stefan de Kroon was the bassist from 1998 to 2017.

The band experienced a breakthrough in 2005 with their third album &quot;Another Day&quot; and the single &quot;Love You More&quot;, which reached number three on the Dutch Top 40 and became one of the biggest hits of the year. They have since recorded four number-one albums on the Dutch Albums Chart alongside the top ten singles &quot;No Mercy&quot;, &quot;Oceaan&quot; and &quot;Het is al laat toch&quot;. The band released their first Dutch-language album &quot;Spijt is iets voor later&quot; in 2021.

== History ==
Racoon started in 1997 as an acoustic duo made up of singer Bart van der Weide and guitarist Dennis Huige. The two previously played in a hardcore punk named Vict&#x27;em, but left to make a different style of music. As a duo, they released three songs for a compilation by The Dutch Rock &amp; Pop Institute. The band relocated to Utrecht in 1998, adding bassist Stefan de Kroon and drummer Paul Bukkens. Bukkens came up with the band name Racoon after watching a documentary about raccoons.

After self-releasing the demo &quot;It&#x27;s an Ice Cream Day&quot; and playing the Noorderslag festival in 1999, the band received several offers and signed to Sony Music. They released two albums on Sony: &quot;Till Monkeys Fly&quot; (2000) and &quot;Here We Go, Stereo&quot; (2001). They had a few minor radio hits, but the band would later say that they view their second album with mixed feelings, as the label insisted on releasing a follow-up soon. When Marlboro asked Racoon to cover a favourite band for a &quot;flashback tour&quot;, they chose Faith No More.

In 2002, Sony dropped Racoon because their head office in the United States wanted the label to dump all the Dutch bands. Now unsigned, singer Van der Weide worked as a garbage man for a year and a half before Racoon were picked up by an independent label, Play It Again Sam. Their third album, &quot;Another Day&quot;, was released in 2005 and sold 60,000 copies in the first year, more than their first two combined. The single &quot;Love You More&quot; reached number three on the Dutch Top 40, and was followed up by further top 40 hits &quot;Laugh About It&quot; and &quot;Brother&quot;. Racoon played the main stage of the Pinkpop Festival in 2006. In 2007, they embarked on their first American tour, opening for The Lemonheads.

Racoon released their fourth album &quot;Before You Leave&quot; in 2008. Their fifth album &quot;Liverpool Rain&quot;, was released in 2011 and featured string arrangements recorded in Abbey Road Studios with the London Chamber Orchestra, arranged by Andrew Powell. The lead single &quot;No Mercy&quot; reached number three on the Dutch Top 40. In 2012, Racoon recorded &quot;Oceaan&quot;, their first Dutch-language song, for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Alles is familie&quot;. It became their third top ten hit, peaking at number six. In 2013, they made the song &quot;Shoes of Lighting&quot; for NPO 3FM&#x27;s Serious Request fundraiser, against child mortality from diarrhea. Their sixth album, &quot;All in Good Time&quot;, was released in 2015 and also went to number one on the Dutch Albums Chart. This was followed by &quot;Look Around and See the Distance&quot; in 2017, which was their last album with bassist Stefan de Kroon, who announced he would leave the band at the end of the year. De Kroon was succeeded by Maarten van Damme, formerly of the bands Abel and Rosemary&#x27;s Sons.

In 2020, Racoon announced their first Dutch-language album, inspired by the death of Van der Weide&#x27;s sister. Its lead single, &quot;Het is al laat toch&quot;, peaked at number two on the Dutch Top 40 in 2020, their biggest hit yet. The album &quot;Spijt is iets voor later&quot; (2021) reached number one again. For their ninth album &quot;It Is What It Is&quot; (2024), the band returned to English songs, supported by the lead single &quot;Nickel for Goodbye&quot;.

<text>To make an argument from silence (Latin: argumentum ex silentio) is to express a conclusion that is based on the absence of statements in historical documents, rather than their presence. In the field of classical studies, it often refers to the assertion that an author is ignorant of a subject, based on the lack of references to it in the author&#x27;s available writings. Thus, in historical analysis with an argument from silence, the absence of a reference to an event or a document is used to cast doubt on the event not mentioned. While most historical approaches rely on what an author&#x27;s works contain, an argument from silence relies on what the book or document does not contain. This approach thus uses what an author &quot;should have said&quot; rather than what is available in the author&#x27;s extant writings.

An argument from silence may apply to a document only if the author was expected to have the information, was intending to give a complete account of the situation, and the item was important enough and interesting enough to deserve to be mentioned at the time. Arguments from silence, based on a writer&#x27;s failure to mention an event, are distinct from &quot;arguments from ignorance&quot; which rely on a total &quot;absence of evidence&quot; and are widely considered unreliable; however arguments from silence themselves are also generally viewed as rather weak in many cases; or considered as fallacies.

==Historical analysis==

===Structure of the argument===

John Lange provided the basic structure for the analysis of arguments from silence based on three components:

* An extant document D in which no reference to an event E appears.
* It is known that the intention of the author of document D was to provide an exhaustive list of all the events in the class of events to which E belongs
* Event E is assumed to be a type of event which the author of D would not have overlooked, had the event taken place.

The applicability of these three conditions is decided on a case-by-case basis, and there are no general dialectical rules for them, except the historian&#x27;s expertise in evaluating the situation. In Lange&#x27;s analysis, an argument from silence is only suggestive and never logically conclusive.

Professors of history Martha Howell and Walter Prevenier thus state that an argument from silence can act as presumptive evidence only if the person failing to mention the information was in a position to have the information, and was purporting to be giving a complete account of the story in question. Howell and Prevenier state that arguments from silence face the difficulty that a historian can not just assume that an author would have recorded the fact in question; for if the fact did not seem important enough to an author it would have been excluded.

Professor of English Michael Duncan states that there are very few scholarly analyses of arguments from silence; but these typically view it as fallacious. Duncan adds that arguments from silence are not mentioned in Aristotle&#x27;s Sophistical Refutations or Hamblin&#x27;s book &quot;Fallacies&quot;, but both of these texts discuss the somewhat similar case of argument from ignorance. Errietta Bissa, professor of Classics at University of Wales, flatly states that arguments from silence are not valid. David Henige states that, although risky, such arguments can at times shed light on historical events.

===Author&#x27;s interest===
The importance of an event to contemporary author plays a role in the decision to mention it, and historian Krishnaji Chitnis states that for an argument from silence to apply, it must be of interest and significance to the person expected to be recording it, else it may be ignored; e.g. while later historians have lauded Magna Carta as a great national document, contemporary authors did not even record a word about its greatness; to them it was a feudal document of low significance, among several other seemingly similar items.

Classicist Timothy Barnes notes that the low level of interest in and awareness of Christians within the Roman Empire at the turn of the first century resulted in the lack of any discernible mention of them by Roman authors such as Martial and Juvenal, although Christians had been present in Rome since the reign of Claudius (41 to 54 AD) and both authors referred to Judaism. Theologian Peter Lampe states that during the first two centuries, the silence of Roman sources on Christians in Rome may be partly due to the fact that Christians often kept to themselves and did not reveal their identities.

===Examples===

====Convincing applications====

An example of a convincing application is that while the editors of the Yerushalmi and Bavli talmuds mention the other community, most scholars believe these documents were written independently; and Louis Jacobs writes, &quot;If the editors of either had had access to an actual text of the other, it is inconceivable that they would not have mentioned this. Here the argument from silence is very convincing.&quot;

Sometimes the silence of multiple sources may have a probative value that sheds light on the historical circumstance, for instance Jacob Neusner states that an argument from silence regarding the absence of an Exilarch sheds light on the relationship between Jews and the Parthian administration in Babylonia.

An example of a convincing application is the silence of Cicero on works of oratory by Cato; the argument gaining its strength from the fact that Cato was such an important figure in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Brutus&quot; and he would have likely been cited if possible. Although Cicero&#x27;s silence on Cato is a convincing argument from silence, the same strength does not apply to Cicero&#x27;s silence on the quaestorship of Caelius, Michael Alexander stating that a number of factors may have precluded Cicero from mentioning it.

====Failed applications====

Yifa has pointed out the perils of arguments from silence, in that the lack of references to a compilation of a set of monastic codes by contemporaries or even by disciples does not mean that it never existed. This is well illustrated by the case of Changlu Zongze&#x27;s &quot;Rules of purity&quot; which he wrote for the Chan monastery in 1103. One of his contemporaries wrote a preface to a collection of his writings neglecting to mention his code. And none of his biographies nor the documents of the Transmission of the Lamp, nor the Pure Land documents (which exalt him) refer to Zongze&#x27;s collection of a monastic code. However a copy of the code in which the author identifies himself
exists.

Historian Pierre Briant points out that the recent discovery of a customs memorandum from Egypt which dates to the time of Xerxes and records the registration and taxation of ships overrides previous reasonings about the type of commercial prosperity associated with Sidon based on the relative silence in texts about roads and is a reminder of the dangers of any argument from silence.

Frances Wood based her controversial book &quot;Did Marco Polo go to China?&quot; on arguments from silence. Wood argued that Marco Polo never went to China and fabricated his accounts because he failed to mention elements from the visual landscape such as tea, did not record the Great Wall and neglected to record practices such as foot-binding. She argued that no outsider could spend 15 years in China and not observe and record these elements. Most historians disagree with Wood&#x27;s reasoning.

Professors of philosophy Sven Bernecker and Duncan Pritchard state that arguments from silence are generally weak and can go astray in many cases, and point to examples such as Marco Polo&#x27;s neglect of the Wall of China, and Pliny the Younger&#x27;s silence on the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum when he discusses the 79 AD eruption of Vesuvius in detail in his letters.

====Use with caution====

Some historians note the general dangers of arguing from silence, but use them in specific cases as indications of levels of professional activity within medieval communities, e.g. historian John E. Law states that while arguing from silence is always dangerous, one may use it as an indication of the low level of local military employment in Camerino for the Da Varano in the Middle Ages. Similarly, historian Patricia Skinner states that after accounting for the dangers of arguments from silence they may provide an indication of the scarcity of females within the medical profession in medieval southern Italy. Historian James Amelang has pointed out that although the autobiographies of early medieval artisans are surprisingly silent on issues regarding their trade and craft, arguing from silence includes hazards in that historians may be assigning weight to past significance in view of modern emphasis.

Barrie J. Cook, the British Museum European coin curator, notes the risks of arguing from silence, yet states that they may shed light on the medieval propensity of the usage of the French denier from Le Mans versus the Angevine.

Greg Walker, professor of rhetoric and English, states that during the reign of Henry VIII, the lack of references to named plays by Nicholas Udall (e.g. the &quot;Respublica&quot;) do not necessarily support their not having been performed at court; given other evidence such as payment warrants issued to Udall for performance masks.

==Legal aspects==
Jed Rubenfeld, professor of Law at Yale Law School, has shown an example of the difficulty in applying arguments from silence in constitutional law, stating that although arguments from silence can be used to draw conclusions about the intent of the Framers of the US Constitution, their application can lead to two different conclusions and hence they can not be used to settle the issues.

In the context of Morocco&#x27;s Truth Commission of 1999 regarding torture and secret detentions, Wu and Livescu state that the fact that someone remained silent is no proof of their ignorance about a specific piece of information. They point out that the absence of records about the torture of prisoners under the secret detention program is no proof that such detentions did not involve torture, or that some detentions did not take place.

<text>Habitat 67, or simply Habitat, is a housing complex at Cité du Havre, on the Saint Lawrence River, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, designed by Israeli-Canadian-American architect Moshe Safdie. It originated in his master&#x27;s thesis at the School of Architecture at McGill University and then an amended version was built for Expo 67, a World&#x27;s Fair held from April to October 1967. Its address is 2600 Avenue Pierre-Dupuy, next to the Marc-Drouin Quay. Habitat 67 is considered an architectural landmark and a recognized building in Montreal.

==History==
Safdie&#x27;s design for Habitat 67 began as a thesis project for his architecture program at McGill University. It was &quot;highly recognized&quot; at the institution, though Safdie cites its failure to win the Pilkington Prize, an award for the best thesis at Canadian schools of architecture, as early evidence of its controversial nature. After leaving to work with Louis Kahn in Philadelphia, Safdie was approached by Sandy van Ginkel, his former thesis advisor, to develop the master plan for Expo 67, the world&#x27;s fair that was set to take place in Montreal during 1967. Safdie decided to propose his thesis as one of the pavilions and began developing his plan. After the plans were approved in Ottawa by Mitchell Sharp, the federal cabinet minister responsible for the exhibition, and Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, Safdie was given the blessing of the Expo 67 Director of Installations, Edward Churchill, to leave the planning committee in order to work on the building project as an independent architect. The construction was done by Anglin-Norcross Ltd. of Montreal. Safdie was awarded the project in spite of his relative youth and inexperience, an opportunity he later described as &quot;a fairy tale, an amazing fairy tale.&quot;

The original plans called for 1,200 homes at a cost of $45 million. However, Safdie could only secure funding for a much reduced construction. This smaller development (about CA$22.4 million) was financed by the federal government, but is now owned by its tenants, who formed a limited partnership that purchased the building from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation in 1985.

== Concept and design ==
Habitat 67 comprises 354 identical, prefabricated concrete forms () arranged in various combinations, divided into three pyramids, reaching up to 12 residential storeys, with a parking level, and a building services level. Together these units created 146 residences of varying sizes and configurations, each formed from one to eight linked concrete units. The complex originally contained 158 apartments, reduced from the original vision of 1,200, but several apartments have since been joined to create larger units, reducing the total number. Each unit is connected to at least one private landscaped garden terrace, built on the roof of the level below, which can range from approximately in size. The apartments each had a moulded plastic bathroom and a modular kitchen.

The development was designed to integrate the benefits of suburban homes—namely gardens, fresh air, privacy, and multilevelled environments—with the economics and density of a modern urban apartment building. It was believed to illustrate the new lifestyle people would live in increasingly crowded cities around the world. Safdie&#x27;s goal for the project to be affordable housing largely failed: demand for the building&#x27;s units has made them more expensive than originally envisioned. In addition, the existing structure was originally meant to only be the first phase of a much larger complex, but the high per-unit cost of approximately $140,000 ($22,120,000 for all 158) prevented that possibility.

The structural engineer for the project was August Eduard Komendant, an Estonian-American structural engineer and a pioneer in the field of prestressed concrete.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.7202/1082359ar&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of Expo 67 was &quot;Man and His World&quot;, taken from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s memoir (literally, &#x27;world of man&#x27;, though it was published under the title &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot;). Housing was also one of the main themes of Expo 67. Habitat 67 then became a thematic pavilion visited by thousands of visitors who came from around the world, and during the expo also served as the temporary residence of the many dignitaries visiting Montreal.

In March 2012, Habitat 67 won an online Lego Architecture poll and is a candidate to be added to the list of famous buildings that inspire a special replica Lego set. Lego bricks were actually used in the initial planning for Habitat; according to Safdie&#x27;s firm, &quot;initial models of the project were built using Lego bricks and subsequent iterations were also built with Lego bricks&quot;.

=== Access ===
Residents have private shuttle access to downtown Montreal, but access by foot is difficult. Guided tours are offered to the public.

In 2023, the extension of the 777 Casino bus route of the Société de transport de Montréal began serving Habitat 67, providing the complex with public transport access for the first time. 

==Legacy==
In 2017, Canada Post issued a commemorative stamp for the 50th anniversary of Expo 67 featuring the structure.

In 2017, from June 1 through August 13, &quot;Habitat &#x27;67 vers l&#x27;avenir / The Shape of Things to Come&quot;, an exhibition at Centre de Design, Université du Québec à Montréal, presented &quot;archival images and objects from the project&#x27;s origins with conceptual drawings, and models, bringing them together with plans for unbuilt iterations&quot;.

As a symbol of Expo 67, which was attended by over 50 million people during the six months it was open, Habitat 67 gained worldwide acclaim as a &quot;fantastic experiment&quot; and &quot;architectural wonder&quot;. This experiment was and is regarded as both a success and failure—it &quot;redefined urban living&quot; and has since become &quot;a very successful co-op&quot;, but at the same time ultimately failed to revolutionize affordable housing or launch a wave of prefabricated, modular development as Safdie had envisioned. Despite its problems, however, Habitat&#x27;s fame and success &quot;made [Safdie&#x27;s] reputation&quot; and helped launch his career; Safdie has now designed over 75 buildings and master plans around the world. Decades after Habitat, much of Safdie&#x27;s work still holds to the concepts that were so fundamental to its design, especially the themes of reimagining high-density housing and improving social integration through architecture that have become &quot;synonymous&quot; with his work. However, &quot;The Guardian&quot; quoted &quot;The Walrus&quot; assessment of it as a &quot;failed dream&quot;.

In 2023, Safdie Architects, in collaboration with Epic Games, modeled the entirety of the original (much larger) vision in Unreal Engine.

==In popular culture==
The music video for Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;In My Secret Life&quot; was filmed at Habitat 67, as were scenes of the 1977 film &quot;The Disapperance&quot;.

It appears on the covers of the 2003 album &quot;Velocity : Design : Comfort&quot; by American electronic/experimental rock act Sweet Trip and the 2012 album &quot;The North&quot; by Canadian indie pop band Stars. It also appears on the album cover of Landslide&#x27;s &quot;Drum &amp; Bossa / Buddah&quot;, his debut single from 1999 that was released on Hospital Records.

<text>Myelitis is inflammation of the spinal cord which can disrupt the normal responses from the brain to the rest of the body, and from the rest of the body to the brain. Inflammation in the spinal cord can cause the myelin and axon to be damaged resulting in symptoms such as paralysis and sensory loss. Myelitis is classified to several categories depending on the area or the cause of the lesion; however, any inflammatory attack on the spinal cord is often referred to as transverse myelitis.

==Types of myelitis==
Myelitis lesions usually occur in a narrow region but can be spread and affect many areas.
* Acute flaccid myelitis: a polio-like syndrome that causes muscle weakness and paralysis.
* Poliomyelitis: disease caused by viral infection in the gray matter with symptoms of muscle paralysis or weakness
* Transverse myelitis: caused by axonal demyelination encompassing both sides of the spinal cord
* Leukomyelitis: lesions in the white matter
* Meningococcal myelitis (or meningomyelitis): lesions occurring in the region of meninges and the spinal cord

Osteomyelitis of the vertebral bone surrounding the spinal cord (that is, vertebral osteomyelitis) is a separate condition, although some infections (for example, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; infection) can occasionally cause both at once. The similarity of the words reflects that the combining form &quot;&quot; has multiple (homonymous) senses referring to bone marrow or the spinal cord.

==Symptoms==
Depending on the cause of the disease, such clinical conditions manifest different speed in progression of symptoms in a matter of hours to days. Most myelitis manifests fast progression in muscle weakness or paralysis starting with the legs and then arms with varying degrees of severity. Sometimes the dysfunction of arms or legs cause instability of posture and difficulty in walking or any movement. Also symptoms generally include paresthesia which is a sensation of tickling, tingling, burning, pricking, or numbness of a person&#x27;s skin with no apparent long-term physical effect. Adult patients often report pain in the back, extremities, or abdomen. Patients also present increased urinary urgency, bowel or bladder dysfunctions such as bladder incontinence, difficulty or inability to void, and incomplete evacuation of bowel or constipation. Others also report fever, respiratory problems and intractable vomiting.

===Diseases associated with myelitis===
Conditions associated with myelitis include:
* Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: autoimmune demyelination of the brain causing severe neurological signs and symptoms
* Multiple sclerosis: demyelination of the brain and spinal cord
* Neuromyelitis optica or Devic&#x27;s disease: immune attack on optic nerve and spinal cord
* Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome: destruction of the exocrine system of the body
* Systemic lupus erythematosus: a systemic autoimmune disease featuring a wide variety of neurological signs and symptoms
* Sarcoidosis: chronic inflammatory cells form as nodules in multiple organs
* Atopy: an immune disorder of children manifesting as eczema or other allergic conditions. It can include atopic myelitis, which causes weakness.
* Immune-mediated myelopathies, heterogeneous group of inflammatory spinal cord disorders including autoimmune disorders with known antibodies

==Cause==
Myelitis occurs due to various reasons such as infections. Direct infection by viruses, bacteria, mold, or parasites such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I/II), syphilis, lyme disease, and tuberculosis can cause myelitis but it can also be caused due to non-infectious or inflammatory pathway. Myelitis often follows after the infections or after vaccination. These phenomena can be explained by a theory of autoimmune attack which states that the autoimmune bodies attack its spinal cord in response to immune reaction.

===Mechanism of myelitis===
The theory of autoimmune attack claims that a person with neuroimmunologic disorders have genetic predisposition to auto-immune disorder, and the environmental factors would trigger the disease. The specific genetics in myelitis is not completely understood. It is believed that the immune system response could be to viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection; however, it is not known why the immune system attacks itself. Especially, for the immune system to cause inflammatory response anywhere in the central nervous system, the cells from the immune system must pass through the blood brain barrier. In the case of myelitis, not only is the immune system dysfunctional, but the dysfunction also crosses this protective blood brain barrier to affect the spinal cord.

===Infectious myelitis ===

Source:

* Viral myelitis: Most viral myelitis is acute, but the retroviruses (such as HIV and HTLV) can cause chronic myelitis. Poliomyelitis, or gray matter myelitis, is usually caused by infection of anterior horn of the spinal cord by the enteroviruses (polioviruses, enteroviruses (EV) 70 and 71, echoviruses, coxsackieviruses A and B) and the flaviviruses (West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis). On the other hand, transverse myelitis or leukomyelitis, or white matter myelitis, are often caused by the herpesviruses and influenza virus. It can be due to direct viral invasion or via immune mediated mechanisms.
* Bacterial myelitis: Bacterial myelitis includes &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;, which is a common agent for respiratory tract. Studies have shown respiratory tract infections within 4–39 days prior to the onset of transverse myelitis. Or, tuberculosis, syphilis, and brucellosis are also known to cause myelitis in immune-compromised individuals. Myelitis is a rare manifestation of bacterial infection.
* Fungal myelitis: Fungi have been reported to cause spinal cord disease either by forming abscesses inside the bone or by granuloma. In general, there are two groups of fungi that may infect the CNS and cause myelitis - primary and secondary pathogens. Primary pathogens include the following: &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot;, &quot;Coccidioides immitis&quot;, &quot;Blastomyces dermatitides&quot;, and &quot;Hystoplasma capsulatum&quot;. Secondary pathogens are opportunistic agents that primarily infect immunocompromised hosts such as Candida species, Aspergillus species, and zygomycetes.
* Parasitic myelitis: Parasitic species infect human hosts through larvae that penetrate the skin. Then they enter the lymphatic and circulatory system, and migrate to liver and lung. Some reach the spinal cord. Parasitic infections have been reported with Schistosoma species, &quot;Toxocara canis&quot;, Echinococcus species, &quot;Taenia solium&quot;, &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot;, and Plasmodium species.

===Autoimmune myelitis===

In 2016, it was identified in Mayo clinic an autoimmune form of myelitis due to the presence of anti-GFAP autoantibodies. Immunoglobulins directed against the α-isoform of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP-IgG) predicted a special meningoencephalomyelitis termed autoimmune GFAP Astrocytopathy that later was found also to be able to appear as a myelitis.

==Diagnosis==
Myelitis has an extensive differential diagnosis. The type of onset (acute versus subacute/chronic) along with associated symptoms such as the presence of pain, constitutional symptoms that encompass fever, malaise, weight loss or a cutaneous rash may help identify the cause of myelitis. In order to establish a diagnosis of myelitis, one has to localize the spinal cord level, and exclude cerebral and neuromuscular diseases. Also a detailed medical history, a careful neurologic examination, and imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are needed. In respect to the cause of the process, further work-up would help identify the cause and guide treatment. Full spine MRI is warranted, especially with acute onset myelitis, to evaluate for structural lesions that may require surgical intervention, or disseminated disease. Adding gadolinium further increases diagnostic sensitivity. A brain MRI may be needed to identify the extent of central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Lumbar puncture is important for the diagnosis of acute myelitis when a tumoral process, inflammatory or infectious cause are suspected, or the MRI is normal or non-specific. Complementary blood tests are also of value in establishing a firm diagnosis. Rarely, a biopsy of a mass lesion may become necessary when the cause is uncertain. However, in 15–30% of people with subacute or chronic myelitis, a clear cause is never uncovered.

==Treatment==
Since each case is different, the following are possible treatments that patients might receive in the management of myelitis.
* Intravenous steroids: High-dose intravenous methyl-prednisolone for 3–5 days is considered as a standard of care for patients suspected to have acute myelitis, unless there are compelling reasons otherwise. The decision to offer continued steroids or add a new treatment is often based on the clinical course and MRI appearance at the end of five days of steroids.
* Plasma exchange (PLEX): Patients with moderate to aggressive forms of disease who do not show much improvement after being treated with intravenous and oral steroids will be treated with PLEX. Retrospective studies of patients with TM treated with IV steroids followed by PLEX showed a positive outcome. It also has been shown to be effective with other autoimmune or inflammatory central nervous system disorders. Particular benefit has been shown with patients who are in the acute or subacute stage of the myelitis showing active inflammation on MRI. However, because of the risks implied by the lumbar puncture procedure, this intervention is determined by the treating physician on a case-by-case basis.
* Immunosuppressants/Immunomodulatory agents: Myelitis with no definite cause seldom recurs, but for others, myelitis may be a manifestation of other diseases that are mentioned above. In these cases, ongoing treatment with medications that modulate or suppress the immune system may be necessary. Sometimes there is no specific treatment. Either way, aggressive rehabilitation and long-term symptom management are an integral part of the healthcare plan.

===Prospective research direction===
Central nervous system nerve regeneration would be able to repair or regenerate the damage caused to the spinal cord. It would restore functions lost due to the disease.
* Engineering endogenous repair: Currently, there exists a hydrogel based scaffold which acts as a channel to deliver nerve growth-enhancing substrates while providing structural support. These factors would promote nerve repairs to the target area. Hydrogels&#x27; macroporous properties would enable attachment of cells and enhance ion and nutrient exchange. In addition, hydrogels&#x27; biodegradability or bioresolvability would prevent the need for surgical removal of the hydrogel after drug delivery. It means that it would be dissolved naturally by the body&#x27;s enzymatic reaction.
* Biochemical repair
:*Neurotropic factor therapy and gene therapy
:*Neurotropic growth factors regulate growth, survival, and plasticity of the axon. They benefit nerve regeneration after injury to the nervous system. They are a potent initiator of sensory axon growth and are up-regulated at the lesion site. The continuous delivery of neurotropic growth factor (NGF) would increase the nerve regeneration in the spinal cord. However, the excessive dosing of NGF often leads to undesired plasticity and sprouting of uninjured sensory nerves. Gene therapy would be able to increase the NGF efficacy by the controlled and sustained delivery in a site-specific manner.
* Stem cell-based therapies: The possibility for nerve regeneration after injury to the spinal cord was considered to be limited because of the absence of major neurogenesis. However, Joseph Altman showed that cell division does occur in the brain which allowed potential for stem cell therapy for nerve regeneration. The stem cell-based therapies are used in order to replace cells lost and injured due to inflammation, to modulate the immune system, and to enhance regeneration and remyelination of axons. Neural stem cells (NSC) have the potential to integrate with the spinal cord because in the recent past investigations have demonstrated their potential for differentiation into multiple cell types that are crucial to the spinal cord. Studies show that NSCs that were transplanted into a demyelinating spinal cord lesion were found to regenerate oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, and completely remyelinated axons.

<text>Severino Gazzellone (5 January 1919 – 21 November 1992), known as Severino Gazzelloni, was an Italian flutist.

== Biography ==

He was born in Roccasecca and died in Cassino. Gazzelloni was the principal flautist with the RAI National Symphony Orchestra in Turin for 30 years and dedicatee of many works. Composers including Luciano Berio (Sequenza I for solo flute, 1958), Pierre Boulez, Bruno Maderna and Igor Stravinsky wrote pieces for him.

Gazzelloni was also a flute teacher. Some of his notable pupils include jazz player Eric Dolphy, classical flautist Abbie de Quant, flautists Ann Cherry and Carol Wincenc, composer Norma Beecroft, and audio engineer Marina Bosi. Dolphy honoured Gazzelloni by naming a composition for him which he included in his 1964 &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot; album.

In summer 1976 he toured through Italy, performing with classical pianist Bruno Canino and a jazz combo that included Enrico Intra (piano), Giancarlo Barigozzi (tenor saxophone), Pino Presti (electric bass), Tullio De Piscopo (drums), and Sergio Farina 
(electric guitar).

<text>Safeco Insurance is an American insurance company based in Seattle. A subsidiary of Liberty Mutual, Safeco provides auto insurance, homeowners insurance, and liability insurance. The company name is an acronym for Selective Auto and Fire Ensurance Company of America, or SAFECO (i.e., S.A.F.E. Co.).

==History==
Safeco was founded in 1923 by Hawthorne Kingsbury Dent (1880-1958) as the General Insurance Company of America, a property and casualty insuring company, with a headquarters in Downtown Seattle at the corner of University Street and Fourth Avenue. In 1936, it moved to the eight-story Brooklyn Building at the corner of N.E. 45th Street and Brooklyn Avenue N.E. in the University District, Seattle. In 1953, it formed a subsidiary, the &quot;Selective Auto and Fire Insurance Company of America,&quot; or SAFECO.

General Insurance began to sell life insurance in 1957. In 1968, it changed its name from the General Insurance Company of America to Safeco Corporation. Around the same time the company began to offer mutual funds and commercial credit, though precursors to the Safeco Funds had been around since the 1930s.

Safeco replaced the Brooklyn Building with the 22-story Safeco Plaza (now UW Tower) building in 1973. It remains the tallest building in the city outside Downtown.

In January 1987, it sold its title insurance business to Chicago Title for $30.7 million cash and $46 million in a 7-year promissory note.

In 1997, Safeco acquired American States Financial Corporation from Lincoln National Corporation for $2.8 billion, expanding beyond the West Coast. Washington Mutual&#x27;s WM Life Insurance Company was purchased the same year. In 1999, Safeco bought R.F. Bailey (Underwriting Agencies) Limited of London. 

In 2001, new management was brought in to restructure the company. Commercial credit operations were sold to GE Capital in August 2001.

In August 2004, the company sold its life insurance and investments business to a group of private investors led by Safeco board members, Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway, and White Mountains Insurance Group, incorporating as Symetra. Hub International acquired Safeco&#x27;s insurance brokerage operations. Mellon Financial acquired Safeco Trust Company, its private bank. Also in 2004, the company sold its land title insurance business to First American Corporation.

In July 2005, CEO Mike McGavick stepped down as CEO to run in the 2006 United States Senate election in Washington.

In May 2006, Assurant acquired Safeco Financial Institution Solutions.

In 2006, Microsoft acquired the company&#x27;s Redmond campus for $209.5 million. The University District complex was sold to the University of Washington for $130 million. Safeco moved back downtown in 2007; its new headquarters at 1001 Fourth Avenue became the new Safeco Plaza, and the former Safeco Plaza was renamed UW Tower.

In May 2007, BlackRock assumed management of the company&#x27;s $10.5 billion investment portfolio.

In September 2008, the company was acquired by Liberty Mutual Insurance for $6.2 billion in cash.

In February 2010, Safeco donated more than 800 pieces of its art collection, valued at $3.5 million, to a consortium of museums, the Washington Art Consortium.

==Sponsorships==
Safeco held the naming rights to the Seattle Mariners&#x27; baseball stadium from its opening in July 1999 through the 2018 season.
The company also sponsored the Safeco Classic, a women&#x27;s professional golf tournament on the LPGA Tour from 1982 through 1999; it was held in September at the Meridian Valley Country Club in Kent.

<text>Jane Powell (born Suzanne Lorraine Burce; April 1, 1929 – September 16, 2021) was an American actress, singer, and dancer who appeared in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals in the 1940s and 50s. With her soprano voice and girl-next-door image, Powell appeared in films, television and on the stage, performing in the musicals &quot;A Date with Judy&quot; (1948), &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; (1951), &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954), and &quot;Hit the Deck&quot; (1955).

In the 1950s Powell starred in the film noir &quot;The Female Animal&quot; (1958) and adventure film &quot;Enchanted Island&quot; (1958). She made appearances on stage in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and television appearances in guest roles on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1981–1982) and the sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1988–1992). She was a veteran of the Golden Age of Hollywood.

Powell starred in off-Broadway productions of &quot;Avow&quot; and &quot;Bounce&quot; in 2000.

In December 2007, she united with the musical group Pink Martini, performing as a vocalist with them in their shared hometown of Portland. She appeared in local theatre productions in Wilton, Connecticut before her death.

== Early years ==
Powell was born Suzanne Lorraine Burce, the only child of Paul Emerson Burce and Eileen Baker Burce, on April 1, 1929, in Portland, Oregon. Powell began dance lessons when she was 2 years old. By age 5, Powell had appeared on the Portland children&#x27;s radio program &quot;Stars of Tomorrow&quot;. She took dance lessons at the Agnes Peters School of Dance, where the Burce family met a talent scout and dance instructor who persuaded the family to move to Oakland, California, to attract Hollywood talent agents. After three months of living in a hotel room, the family returned to Portland, and her father took a job managing a Banbury Cross apartment building. While living in Banbury Cross, Powell took singing lessons.

When Powell was 12 years old, a talent promoter helped her get selected as the Oregon Victory Girl. She began singing on Portland radio station KOIN and traveled Oregon for two years, singing and selling victory bonds. While vacationing in California in 1943, Powell won a Hollywood talent show and signed a contract with MGM Theaters in Hollywood the next day at the age of 14.

She wanted to go back to high school and to university, but her mother forbade this as she was the only one in the family making good money.

== Career ==
=== 1943–1950===
After signing with MGM, Powell was lent to United Artists for her first film, &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot; (1944), where she played the character of Jane Powell and took that as her professional name. In 1945, Powell sang &quot;Because&quot; at the wedding of Esther Williams and Ben Gage.

Powell&#x27;s second feature film was &quot;Delightfully Dangerous&quot; (1945), then she appeared in &quot;Holiday in Mexico&quot; (1946), where she met Roddy McDowall, who became a life-long friend.
More films followed, including &quot;Three Daring Daughters&quot; (1948), &quot;A Date with Judy&quot; (1948), &quot;Luxury Liner&quot; (1948), &quot;Nancy Goes to Rio&quot; (1950), and &quot;Two Weeks with Love&quot; (1950).

Powell lamented that, at the age of 25 and with children of her own, she found herself typecast in teenage roles, but she accepted the roles because she needed to support her family.

In 1949, Powell sang at Harry S. Truman’s inaugural ball, and she sang for five U.S. presidents and the queen of England.

=== 1951–1958 ===

In 1951, Powell co-starred in the musical comedy &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; with Fred Astaire as performing siblings. She also appeared that year in &quot;Rich, Young and Pretty&quot;.

She starred in &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; and &quot;Three Sailors and a Girl&quot; in 1953. Powell starred in &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; in 1954. In 2006, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; was named one of the greatest American musicals of all time by the American Film Institute. Powell starred in &quot;Athena&quot; and &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; in 1954.

In 1955, Powell starred opposite Tony Martin, Debbie Reynolds, Ann Miller, and Russ Tamblyn in &quot;Hit the Deck&quot;, which was a commercial failure, underperforming at the box office. The following year, she recorded the song &quot;True Love&quot;, which rose to number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and number 107 on the pop charts for that year, according to the Joel Whitburn compilation. This was her only single to make the charts. Also in 1956, Powell performed the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Stop Loving You&quot; at the 28th Academy Awards. Next, Powell appeared in RKO Pictures&#x27; musical comedy &quot;The Girl Most Likely&quot;, playing a woman who becomes engaged to three men simultaneously. Though shot in 1956, the film was not released until 1958, after RKO went out of business.

Known mainly for her roles in musical comedies, Powell appeared in a rare dramatic role in the film noir &quot;The Female Animal&quot; (1958) from Universal Pictures, which marked the final film of co-star Hedy Lamarr.

=== 1959–1980 ===
By the late 1950s, after Powell&#x27;s contract with MGM expired and her film offers began to slow, she turned to theater. Her first summer stock role was in a production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in Dallas, Texas, in 1958. The following year, she co-starred with Tab Hunter, Patty Duke, and Myrna Loy in a television remake of the musical &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;. She starred in a stage production of &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot; (1962). In 1962, Powell made her debut appearance on the television series &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, in which she appeared in numerous episodes until 1972.
In 1964, Powell starred as Eliza Doolittle in a production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at Los Angeles&#x27; Valley West Theatre, which established a record gross for West Coast-based productions of the play. She also toured in 1964 in a musical review titled &quot;Just 20 Plus Me!&quot; It was done to a recorded track and featured Powell with 20 handsome &quot;chorus boys&quot;. Asked after the performance if the production was going to be made available on a commercial recording, she said simply &quot;No.&quot;

She had the title role in &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; in 1966, as well as the female lead in an Atlanta-based production of &quot;Carousel&quot;, followed by &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; at the Carousel Theater in Los Angeles in 1967. Also in 1967, she starred in a touring production of &quot;Brigadoon&quot;. Next, she portrayed Maria von Trapp in a production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; in 1968. In addition to her stage work, Powell appeared in three television films: &quot;Wheeler and Murdoch&quot; (1972), &quot;The Letters&quot; (1973), and &quot;Mayday at 40,000 Feet!&quot; (1976).

In 1972, Powell appeared in a Cincinnati-based stage production of &quot;Meet Me In St. Louis&quot;. The following year, Powell made her Broadway debut playing the title character in &quot;Irene&quot;, following Debbie Reynolds&#x27; performance in the title role. Mel Gussow of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Powell&#x27;s performance, writing: &quot;The two stars are an equal match for peppiness. Miss Reynolds may score a point for clowning, but Miss Powell wins two for softness.&quot;

Howard Keel and she appeared on stage together in a revival of &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;.

=== 1981–2021 ===
In the early 1980s, Powell toured in the comedies &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot;; &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot;, and &quot;Chapter Two&quot;.
Between 1981 and 1982, Powell had guest-starring role on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. In 1985, she started a 9-month run in the daytime soap opera &quot;Loving&quot;, playing a tough mother and businesswoman, followed by another guest-starring part on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in 1985. In 1988, Powell was cast in a recurring guest role on the popular sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, in which she played Irma Seaver, the mother of Dr. Jason Roland Seaver (Alan Thicke). The same year, in May 1988, Powell married her longtime companion, former child actor Dickie Moore. The couple had met while Moore was performing research for his autobiography &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, but Don&#x27;t Have Sex or Take the Car.&quot;
In the early 1990s, Powell was a temporary replacement on the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; for Eileen Fulton as Lisa Grimaldi. In 1996 and 1997, she appeared in the off-Broadway production &quot;After-Play&quot;. She also performed the role of the Queen in Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot; at New York City Opera. In 2000, Powell appeared in the Off-Broadway production &quot;Avow&quot;, in which she portrayed a devout Catholic woman whose gay son wishes to marry his partner in the church. This was followed by a stage production of &quot;70, Girls, 70&quot;, the same year. In 2002, she guest-starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, followed by a role in the Showtime film &quot;The Sandy Bottom Orchestra&quot; (2003).

In 2003, she made a return to the stage as Mama Mizner in the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Bounce&quot;, which held performances in Chicago and Washington, DC. &quot;I auditioned just to meet Sondheim, who was nice and a very funny man,” Powell admitted. &quot;But I was disappointed when I got the part. I didn&#x27;t really want to be away from home, but I had never done a new show and that seemed exciting at first. But I didn&#x27;t have much to do and the part wasn&#x27;t too jovial.&quot;

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2007, Powell returned to her hometown of Portland, Oregon, to narrate Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; with the Portland-based musical group Pink Martini. She also appeared on March 9, 2008, with Pink Martini at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City, singing a duet of &quot;Aba Daba Honeymoon&quot; with lead singer China Forbes.

In March 2009, she appeared and sang &quot;Love Is Where You Find It&quot; in a show in which Michael Feinstein celebrated movie musicals and MGM musicals in particular. She performed again with Pink Martini at the Hollywood Bowl on September 10, 2010. Powell filled in as guest host on Turner Classic Movies for Robert Osborne when he was on medical leave from July 17–23, 2011.

== Personal life ==
On November 5, 1949, Powell married former figure skater Gearhardt Anthony Steffen. The union produced two children, Gearhardt III (born July 21, 1951) and Suzanne Ilene (born November 21, 1952). In 1953, Powell began an affair with Gene Nelson, her married co-star in &quot;Three Sailors and a Girl&quot;. Powell and Nelson planned to marry after divorcing their spouses, but after divorcing his wife, Nelson backed out of marrying Powell.

Powell married car dealer Patrick W. Nerney on November 8, 1954. Their daughter, Lindsay Averill, was born on February 1, 1956. Powell and Nerney divorced in May 1963.

In 1965, Powell married Hollywood publicist and manager Jim Fitzgerald, who managed her career. They divorced in 1975. She married David Stellar Parlour in 1978 and divorced him in 1981.

Powell married child star Dickie Moore in 1988. After Moore died in 2015, Powell moved to their home in Wilton, Connecticut, where she died of natural causes on September 16, 2021, at the age of 92.

== Legacy ==

Powell was referred to as one of the last surviving stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood. She secured her place in history with her performance in &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;.

Despite bouts with severe depression, anxiety and insecurity, Powell retained a public image of the all-American girl-next-door and was a symbol of simpler times. Powell&#x27;s role in &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot; in 1944, a film that presented Powell as a wholesome girl next door, was suspected to have pigeon-holed her in future musicals.

In 1960, Powell was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<doc id="218590" wikidata="Q2217567" url="?curid=218590" title="Dorado, Puerto Rico">
<text>Dorado () is a town and municipality on the northern coast of Puerto Rico, west of San Juan and is located in the northern region of the island, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, north of Toa Alta, east of Vega Alta, and west of Toa Baja. Dorado is subdivided into five barrios and Dorado Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. During the early 18th century, there were already mentions of a &quot;Sitio de Dorado&quot; (meaning a golden place) in some San Juan registers. Since the beginning of the Spanish colonial period and until 1831, Dorado existed as a barrio (or ward) of the town of Toa Baja. Over several years, the ward grew and established its own town center called the &quot;new pueblo&quot; to differentiate itself from Toa Baja, which became known as the &quot;old pueblo.&quot; Over several years, the barrios that currently make up Dorado grew and the people of the &quot;new pueblo&quot; wanted to separate themselves from Toa Baja.

On November 22, 1842, Jacinto López Martínez, the Sergeant at Arms for the ward of Dorado, petitioned the Spanish Governor of Puerto Rico, Santiago Méndez Vigo, to establish the municipality of Dorado. The governor authorized the founding of the town pending the construction of public works, including an administrative building and a church near the town square. In 1848, the construction of the public works were completed and López Martínez became the first mayor of Dorado. Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1902, four years after the Spanish–American War, Dorado was again appended to Toa Baja. But in 1905 it regained its status as a separate town. Nowadays, Dorado has upscale neighborhoods and a small downtown area with a &quot;plaza&quot; (main town square), as other Puerto Rican municipalities. The town&#x27;s patron saint is Anthony of Padua, and patron saint celebrations are held at the plaza every year on June 13.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian period and colonization===
The region adjacent Toa river (modern day La Plata river) was inhabited by several indigenous groups that left behind physical proof of their presence in the region. The area surrounding the Toa river was scouted by Juan Ponce de León during his initial reconnaissance of the geography of the main island. Near it, the Conquistadores built some huts in which to rest. However, citing &quot;difficulties&quot; with the region, the Spaniards opted to move to the region that would eventually become Caparra, the colonial Spanish capital of San Juan Bautista (the original Spanish name for Puerto Rico). During the beginning of the Spanish colonization, the area known as Toa was ruled by Taíno cacique (a title akin to Chief) Aramaná, who controlled the regions comprising Punta Salinas to Cibuco river (modern day Toa Baja through Vega Baja). After Agüeybana I (a title akin to High Chief or king) entered in association with the Spanish conquistadors through the guaytiao he became known as Francisco de Aramaná, also being recognized as a Don. Now technically as politically influential as Agüeybana due to the ceremony, the Spanish were able to include the lower ranking caciques, including Aramaná, in the &quot;encomiendas&quot; system and placed several in charge of royal farms and mining operations near Toa river. The region proved production both in agriculture and mining and an assimilation process began between both cultures. Ponce de León himself created Hacienda del Rey and requested the creation of a new conuco near Toa river, which was later sold to Pedro Ortiz. The conquistador also built other properties that he later sold to other Spaniards. Around 500 Taínos worked under the caciques in the area.

Oral tradition claims that a Spaniard named Juan González somehow survived long enough after being severely injured in the initial Taíno offensive of the Spanish–Taíno War of San Juan–Borikén to reach the region of Toa and warn the conquistadores. Ten years after the beginning if the colonization, more than 17 estates were built in the region, with harvests being transported through the Toa river to Palo Seco and to the Capital from there. After Ponce de León transferred Hacienda del Rey to other Spaniards, the estate steadily declined and by 1524 denounces were made about its state. As more Spanish families settled, problems between neighbors arose, prompting Francisco de Negrete to request that a mayor was assigned to the region in 1611. However, it is not until 1731 that ra mayor, Juan Dávila, appears in the records. During the following decades, more than 24 mayors would serve office, with military officers taking prominence beginning in the 1740s.

===Existence as part of Toa Baja===
On September 11, 1627, San Juan&#x27;s council ordered the creation of a ship route between Bayamón and Toa, giving control of the rent to the council of the first city. From here, the rest of the route was traversed on horseback. On the way from the Capital to the central north coast, two passages were encountered, the Palo Seco and the Boca Hababa river. After crossing the second, a rest area was built in modern-day Barrio Mameyal. With an increase in traffic, the inhabitants of the town of Toa saw business opportunities and began joining the local fishermen, steadily creating a small settlement. By the first half of the 18th century, the locale was already known as &quot;Dorado&quot;, &quot;Boca del Dorado&quot; or &quot;Alto del Dorado&quot; and referred to as such in official documentation. The municipality of Toa Baja was founded either in 1745. Other sources place the foundation taking place in 1747. With this development, the region became part of it. The Santa Hermandad mayor would then become municipal mayor. By 1748, the Settler Captain was George García Páes. In February 1761, there was a conflict between the overseer of the Boca Havana passage, Cayetano Quiñones, and the local fishermen in which the location became relevant. The control and lent of these passages remained in contention during the following century, with the San Juan council refereeing similar issues.

Towards the 18th century&#x27;s end and entering the 19th century, the municipality had become a hub for sugar plantations led by Spanish hacendados and slavers, who exploited an international need for sugar caused by the Haitian revolution to export it and derivatives like rum while also meeting local demands. Other crops were also grown, but no priority was given to them. The end of the Napoleonic wars and the elimination of some taxes allowed a new generation of hacendados from the capital of San Juan to benefit from the booming industry, among the mayors Jacinto López Martínez and José Canales. However, the roads that lead to Western Puerto Rico crossed through el Dorado and this, combined with flooding concerns, did not allow the municipality to develop a proper urban center, with Palo Seco being its main commerce epicenter. By 1820, Dorado itself was as big as the municipal town and the crisis lead to a proposal of relocating the municipal town there being presented to colonial governor Miguel de la Torre by &quot;hacendados&quot; with ties to him during a visit. On October 20, 1824, the move was authorized, but it stalled due to opposition from the settlers. However, this same year a hurricane named Santa Ana ravaged and flooded the municipal town, causing the death of people and cattle, accelerating the process. The following years, the construction of a royal house and a church had begun at Dorado. During this time, Toa Baja&#x27;s mayor José Marí Ramírez de Arellano requested moving the boat access point near the entry of Dorado to a more accessible location, avoiding dangerous body of waters in the process, which was later conceded by the council of San Juan. However, the free transit to Dorado for the neighbors of the municipal town of Toa Baja was attended afterwards, despite being part of the initial request. By 1829, the local militias and the justice offices were relocated as well. However, entering the following decades the dissidents of the move led by mayor José Manuel de Córdova extra officially forced the return of the municipal institutions and returned them to Toa Baja, claiming lack of proper maintenance. Despite this, Dorado continued growing as the traffic of people traversing through the royal road rose. By 1832, a teacher named José Viada was teaching the local children. The settlement eventually earned the nickname of &quot;Pueblo Nuevo&quot; to differentiate it from Toa Baja (&quot;Pueblo Viejo&quot;).

===Secession disputes with Toa Baja===
With the plantations led by administrators, the flourish in the sugar industry continued until 1840, when the market entered in a crisis and the price if products crashed, leaving the region with a declining industry. In 1839, Palo Seco opted to become a separate municipality. On March 10, 1841, colonial governor Santiago de Méndez Vigo authorized moving all the administrative offices from Dorado to Toa Baja, faced by pressure from the settlers. Consequently, former mayor and hacendado Jacinto López Martínez, who had employed his friendship with De la Torre to acquire local terrains between 1813 and 1835, proposed creating a separate municipality by the name of El Dorado to secure his wealth by acquiring the title of Settlement Captain. In a reunion with friends and family, he formalized this request. The justification was based in the population growth in Dorado and adjacent barrios and possessing enough resources to sustain itself separately. In arrangements that took place on July 27, 1841, in San Juan, López was joined by José de Folgueras as prospective beneficiaries if the move and his proposal was supported by Manuel Canales, Celedonio Nevárez, Juan P. Nevárez, Domingo López, Andrés Martínez, Florencio Sánchez, José M. López, Ignacio Arrazaín and Ignacio Cordero, who offered to build the buildings necessary to sustain the town. The official request took place shortly afterwards, with the governor requesting feedback from the municipality of Toa Baja after being counseled to do so. After more than a month, the reply contained strong opposition to the separation, heavily criticizing the capacities of those involved in the request citing personal ambitions as a motive and claiming that the lands were unproductive, that the area was plagued with environmental factors that &quot;resulted in the early death&quot; of its residents and that the water was unclean. The rebuttal also claimed that the barrios pushing for separation were unable too poor to sustain the public workings of a town, despite being the ones that contributed most to the fisco up to this point, the purported lack of personnel and a workforce or that the proximity of the settlements would be unlawful. After being given copies of Toa Baja&#x27;s opposition, López and Folgueras requested that the complaints were dismissed and questioned the accuracy of any of the counterarguments, also opting to criticize that some of the proponents were being targeted for being poor, which should not prevent them from entering association. The group also labelled Toa Baja as a failed municipality by using its iwn criteria, responding that the criticism for lack of a workforce was unfair since despite its age the town faced similar problems.

Public hearings were then proposed and accepted by the colonial governor. The process was assigned to Commander Miguel Delgado, who left to Toa Baja accompanied by witnesses Plácido de Cabrera and Juan M. Feijoó. The following day, March 10, 1842, the preliminary preparations began. Only 14 of the 120 available testified in the hearings, which were interviewed about their residence in Dorado and expressed favor for the creation of a municipality. Delgado also supervised the status of progression in the construction of a Catholic church. On March 13, 1842, a process to interview the opponents at Toa Baja, who had since stepped our from authority, began and extended for three days. Afterwards, Delgado returned to San Juan with a report for the governor favoring the establishment of a new municipality due to favorable conditions and military potential and discarding proximity as a factor, since Camuy and Hatillo were already proximate. Méndez Vigo delegated the issue to an aid, Anacleto Buelta, who suggested interviewing the current Toa Baja administration and argued inconsistencies in witness selection. Delgado died suddenly shortly afterwards. Buelta then recommended beginning a new process again in Toa Baja, which the colonial governor conceded and assigned the task to councilor Domingo García. On May 28, 1842, he left the capital accompanied by witnesses Plácido de Cabrera and Eusebio de Cabrera. The second set of hearings began on June 1, 1842, in the town hall of Toa Baja, which assigned a commission to oversee the process, with several of the previous deponents ratifying their previous statements and 23 inhabitants of Dorado supporting the request for separation, with the remainder being forced to attend subsequent hearings by the local court. All ratified their previous support except five, who felt that they would be forced to work in the church, a job that they had left at Toa Baja. The only exceptions, according to the rural mayors of Dorado and Maguayo, were either sick or absent. The Toa Baja Commission, represented by mayor Juan Landrón an overseer and the municipal secretary, proposed that only proprietors, those that paid subsidies, should be consulted, considering the declarations of those that didn&#x27;t useless and potentially damaging to those that did. The municipal government also opposed the declarations of no -resident proponents, those that weren&#x27;t family heads or that had any connection with the main proponents, accompanied by a list of people that they considered ineligible.

===Founding of Dorado===
On June 4, 1842, Landrón submitted a list of people that were considered eligible by his administration, including residents from barrios that were not initially interested in the action. This same day, opposition hearings were held where the administration if Toa Baja presented its case, with López and Folgueras serving as witnesses. A total of 91 neighbors from these barrios attended, with the opinions regarding the foundation of Dorado being in favor of the opposition 125–8, without counting a number of indifferent attendees. Hearing concluded on June 9, 1842, with a relevant report being completed the same day. Like the first, it was delegated to an aide. Two days later, López addressed the colonial governor requesting a copy of the aide&#x27;s conclusion, citing the suspicion that the municipality of Toa Baja had used ineligible witnesses to dilate the process. Shortly afterwards, López impugned the declarations of opposing witnesses, noting that most did not live near the proposed municipality and that others simply wanted to avoid paying more to the government, requesting statistics of paying inhabitants of Dorado with which to argue that they were capable of sustaining a new town. On August 12, 1842, the proponents sent a recount of the process and requested that the colonial governor authorized the founding of Dorado, printing the aid to request the opinion of the Toa Baja administration. On September 8, 1842, the municipal government once again opposed the separation. After receiving it, aide Melitón Belanzathegui recommended proceeding with the foundation of a new municipality, with Méndez Vigo authorizing the creation of San Antonio del Dorado on November 22, 1842. The government made demands guaranteeing the construction of several building, towards which López placed his own properties as collateral. The founders also requested to begin the process to assign or elect relevant authority figures, all of which were granted. The colonial governor also named López Settler Captain and ordered that all buildings were completed within a year and a half. The demarcation process was initially overseen by Pedro García with the help of Julio O&#x27;Neill of the Bayamón Department with Carlos Vuagneaux taking charge following a suspención due to weather, and began on January 10, 1843, extending for six days. The cost of establishing the new municipality ascended 4,196 pesos with 20 cents. Despite the founding of a number of schools, the education in the new municipality was troubled by the instability in the permanency of teachers appointed by the Catholic Church.

During this time, there were around 17 high class residences in the municipality, while the working class lived in wood huts. Depending on an agricultural economy, there were several hundred African slaves working in the Spanish haciendas of Dorado. On March 6, 1843, there was a slave uprising in the hacienda of Francisco Cantero, who after being received by gunfire in the Catholic Church in Toa Baja, fled to the sugar plantations of Dorado, where the government captured them and sentenced several to death. Despite royal decrees prohibiting the traffic of African slaves, the Spaniards continued illegally importing them, with Dorado mayor José Carreras actively participating in the trade. However, the salve population was severely hit by a cholera epidemic, and two years later the colonial government confiscated a ship property of Carreras was confiscated due to its suspected links with the activity. Consternation in the colonial authorities lead to the slaves being permitted to file complaints before the Municipal Sindico Receiver. A predominantly Catholic culture also brought another phenomenon, in which repentant slave owners set them free as part if their last will. Other work sources, like corral fishing, required permission first from the council of San Juan and later from the municipal administration.

By 1848, the municipality of Dorado was running all of its functions under López, now mayor and War Lieutenant and in charge of filling several reports related to the population, wealth and agricultural production. Afterwards, the mayor would be elected by the governor from a pool of three candidates selected by the municipality&#x27;s elite and only served a maximum of two years. During this time, the economy was dependent on 9 sugar haciendas and 54 cattle estates. The industry in question was dominated by López himself, Manuel Skerrett, Francisco Cantero, José Marrero, Carlos Vassallo, Miguel Torrens, Juan P. Nevárez, Florencio Salgado, and the inheritors of María E. Martínez. Being located in the Camino Real (Royal Highway) grocery and other types of stores were run by people like Antonio Solé, Benito Carreras, and Juana Sánchez and brothers. These types of businesses continued flourishing for the following decades. By 1859, there were 179 farms in Dorado. López, Salgado and others also created brick and lime powder factories. At the First Public Exposition of Industry, Agriculture and Arts, Lechet demonstrated his advances in processing white sugar, which earned him a silver commendation from the Secretary of the Royal Commerce Board, Andrés Viña. In the third edition of this event, a Dorado factory won the gold award for a variety if products.

===Abolition of slavery and Spanish–American War===
On March 19, 1850, the municipality was reclassified as a Second Class Mayorship. On August 4, 1860, Toa Baja mayor Manuel Aguayo proposed the merger of Dorado into Toa Baja, which was opposed by Dirado mayor Pablo A. Dueño and his administration. A month later the proposal was dropped by the colonial governor. Upon his death in 1862, López himself left money for his slaves. His inheritors failed to preserve the terrains that were received from him. In 1870, a group of four slaves -named Manuel Díaz, Juan Pedro, Juan D. Epifanio and Benito- killed the butler of hacienda La Monserrate, Manuel M. Sampayo Saldaña, who had developed a reputation for the eating the violently. For this act, the colonial government executed them on September 26, 1870. The event would become part of Dorado&#x27;s oral tradition. Despite drop in the local price of slaves, some residents of Cuba would buy slaves and export them to that island where the price was rising. In 1872, an incident involving a Frenchman named José Beaupied lead to the slaver being intervened and losing the four children of a slave that he had bought, but she was transferred to Dorado and with the help of a fellow Frenchman and later committed suicide. The event was controversial and lead to the local British ambassador, H. August Cowper, protesting the moving if slaves between the islands before the Spanish crown. Telegraph lines were placed in 1870, connecting Dirado to several municipalities and remaining in service for more than a century.

As abolition became impending, several entities including Sucesión de Torrens, Sobrinos de Arrazaín and Skerret y Hermanos joined individuals such as Ambrosio Martorell and released their slaves pro bono. For thus action, they were commended by the Spanish Crown on April 26, 1873. In total, the abolition granted freedom to 402 slaves in Dorado. Oral tradition claims that the freed celebrated until midnight, when a thunderstorm suddenly appeared and during which the tomb of Sampayo was struck by lightning. A series of earthquakes in late 1867 damaged buildings in Dorado, particularly the Catholic Church. In 1872, local instruction was placed in charge of José Iglesias and six years later the situation began improving. In 1884, José D. Félix and Pedro M. Agüeeo founded private schools, which attended an interest of the higher classes to educate their children. Entering the next decade, there were six public schools and several hundred children being educated. However, the elementary system was troubled, with only two schools classified as Second Class by the government. By this time there were more than 200 houses in the urban area of Dorado and over 270 families.

Dorado remained a poor municipality throughout the 19th century and the 1873 agricultural crisis exacerbated its issues to the point that towards 1897 was unable to pay debts that had been accumulating for nearly 30 years. During this crisis, several of the hacendados were forced to mortgage their haciendas, incurring in large debts that lead to some losing them. On July 20, 1870, the annexation to Toa Baja was proposed by conservatives, but failed to proceed. Early during this decade, there were seven businesses that paid subsidies, while during the second half there were some 14 businesses. On June 10, 1873, the municipality of Dorado requested permission to widen and deepen the La Plata river mouth to allow larger ships to enter in an attempt to reinvigorate the sugar industry. However, a prolonged draught seriously affected the crops and combined with the payment that was now given to former slaves, the situation quickly declined.

Jacinto López II became mayor in 1875, holding the office until the year of his death nine years later, but despite this influence debt made him lose the terrains that once belonged to his father to the colonial government. The budgets were not satisfactory, but Dorado received the control of the passage of La Plata, which it rented. However, the passage soon became a point of contention between those that wanted to oversee it and the municipality, including a failed 1878 litigation presented to the colonial governor himself during a visit. By this year, there were only seven steam powered sugar mills working in the municipality.

On March 8, 1891, the train track connecting Dorado to Manatí and Martín Peña were inaugurated. The passenger train would operate until the 1940s. A sales tax was imposed to try and counter the crisis in 1895, but within a year the abolition of Dorado as a municipality was considered. The final decade of the century borough forth a sugar renaissance, growing to 11 haciendas which were complemented by a coffee estate. By 1893, there were 229 farms, with seven totaling more than half of the terrains with Pablo Ubarri being the dominant owner. As consequence of the Spanish–American War, Dorado was placed in charge of the colonial American government on October 11, 1898.

===American military administration===
Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Dorado was 3,804.

This change in sovereignty resulted in several of the local haciendas being systematically redistributed between Americans such as R.S. Brown, William W. Miner and corporations like Y.P.R. Fruit Land Co. and Finlay Waymouth and Lee, Inc. during the following decade. Ubarri&#x27;s terrains were fragmented and part of it ended being owned by Afred Livingston and his daughter Clara. The Parraoquial House was seized by the colonial government and in 1922 the municipality turned it into an emergency building.

Elections for municipal offices began being held on January 16, 1900. The results were certified by representative of the colonial government, Lt. Woodson Hocker. By 1902, there were six schools in Dorado. These institutions would later be staffed by Doradeños that graduated from the University of Puerto Rico, completed by other locals. With time, some families would dedicate to instruction. By the second decade of the century, Escuela Jacinto López Martínez and Segunda Unidad de Maguayo were built to accommodate the increasing school age population, with the first being created at the behest of mayor Heraclio López Canino.

Alfredo López would take the office of mayor from his father and begin a series of urban development projects. The following two decades, Pedro López Canino and two rural schools were built. Near it, the Escuela Ricardo Arroyo Laracuente served as middle school. In 1952, Manuel Morales García was elected as mayor. In 1964, a local high school was built so that local children did not have to travel to Toa Baja, the following decade it was renamed after local attorney José S. Alegría.

Pedro López Canino served as mayor taking over the municipal administration when Dorado&#x27;s budget was merely $3,000, with this sum ascending to $18,000 by the 1920s. The first telephone lines were placed in 1910 and operators were employed until the 1960s. That same year, the Puerto Rico Power and Light Co. installed electrical lines.

New stores were founded early in this century, including El Siglo XX and Salgado y Pérez, both of which ceased to exist during the first half of the century. The first gas station in Dorado was founded by Ramón Pérez, who also created the Dorada Bus Line. Milk and ice were also distributed. Maritime and fresh water fishers were responsible for providing fresh fish and several would later become part of Dorado&#x27;s oral tradition. During the 1950s, the Dorado Fishing Club introduced sport fishing to the municipality.

Ultimately, Dorado was annexed to Toa Alta in 1902, when the Puerto Rico legislature ordered the move due to its economic woes. In March 1905, the same entity reversed the move. By 1920, 177 farms remained, with a sharp decline in mid-sized and small properties. Three years after the death of Alfred Livingston in 1923, the government reclaimed Mata Redonda farm since it had been acquired illegally, but after being repelled with armed resistance during the impending, the case was seen by the colonial Federal Court, which failed in favor of Clara Livingston. With the foreign interests, cultivation of sugar rose and reached 400 square meters (a unit known in Spanish as &quot;cuerda&quot;) of land, but coffee stopped being produced. Other fruits began increasing production during the 1940s. Most of the population was dependent on the opportunities offered by the agricultural entities, which lead to a pronounced unemployment rate. To counter this, the worker&#x27;s union donated the building where the Dorado Hand Craft factory was established, operating for two decades. New aqueducts and a sewer system replaced a well based system during 1948–50. In 1936, a new bridge crossing La Plata river was inaugurated.

During the 1940s, there was widespread construction of public and private housing to accommodate a series of government reforms. Among these was El Pueblo del Niño, a refuge for children. In 1947, the municipal assembly adopted the official map of Dorado that was proposed with the barrios of Higuillar, Maguayo, Espinosa, Mameyal and Río Lajas.

===Commonwealth===
In 1953, a widespread fire destroyed 11 houses, with its residents being relocated to new homes provided by charity. This precipitated the creation of a local fire station in 1956. The end of the Korean War lead to another urbanization wave. The construction of private project Urbanización Martorell resulted in several Doradeños returning to settle the houses. This tendency continued during the following three decades, with middle and high class projects being built. In 1957, a road was built between Dorado and Palo Seco.

By the mid-20th century, Dorado continued producing sugar, fruits and cattle, but there was a continued decline in the presence of small and mid-sized properties. However, by this time Finlay Waymouth and Lee, Inc. disappeared. Wealthy families, both local and American, continued acquiring the terrains of Dorado. During the 1950s, an economic shift lead to the virtual disappearance of the sugar industry and the terrains were repurposed for cattle. Clara Livingston sold her terrains to the Rickefelker family, who turned them into two hotels, Dorado Beach and Cerromar. Late in the decade, Dorado created a Municipal Library, located in the old emergency building.

Stores such as La Vencedora and La Favorita were founded during this time, operating during the following decades. In 1972, Alfonso López Chaar was elected mayor with a platform based on sports and culture. Dorado became the first municipality to adopt the landfill system. The 2nd G7 summit was held at the Dorado Beach Resort between June 27 and 28, 1976.

Casa del Rey, which after being acquired from the government by López had served as the house of several people and a political center, was restored by the municipality and the ICP during the second half of the 20th Century. In 1985, the municipal administration began a restoration and redevelopment project named Dorado 2000 prior to the celebration of Dorado&#x27;s 150th Anniversary. When Alfonso López Chaar left the office of mayor to become Secretary of State in 1987, his successor Carlos López became the youngest mayor in Puerto Rico at that point at the age of 29. In 1988 the Committee on the Quality of Life of a Puerto Rico recognized the municipality as first in their life quality rankings. The municipality revalidated and was included into the entity&#x27;s hall of fame. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo made landfall in Puerto Rico and caused heavy damages to the municipality. By the 1990s, Dorado del Mar had closed, with Cerromar and Dorado Beach continuing their function. In 1991, a reforestation initiative named Dorado Siembra was implanted. That same year the ICP named the town&#x27;s cultural program a &quot;cultural model&quot;.

On January 6, 1992, floods destroyed the La Plata bridge. That same year, the administration of Dorado held concurrent Fifth Centenary and municipal anniversary events. The Dorado Airport was operated from 1942 to 1996. The airport began as a military landing strip, then became a civilian airport in the 1960s with Caribair and Dorado Wings flights operating until 1980 and 1982 respectively. The airport operated as a private landing strip throughout the 1980s and then fell into disrepair. In 1996, the airport was rezoned as residential land and redeveloped.

On September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Dorado, 1,175 homes were left without a roof and 625 homes were destroyed.
In mid 2018, the United States Army Corps of Engineers announced it would be undertaking a major flood control project of a river that often causes flooding in Dorado, Río de la Plata.

===Act 60===
In 2012, the Luis Fortuño administration passes broad tax incentives for foreigners through Acts 20 and 22 (later consolidated into Act 60–2019), which included 0% on capital gains and a 4% corporate rate. Some areas became favored by the individuals that arrived to Puerto Rico to benefit, including Dorado Beach where mansions and villas sold in the 20–30 million range. The price of property in Dorado rose 66% between 2016 and 2019. With the turn of the decade more foreigners have moved to Dorado Beach, including Kevin Thobias and Logan Paul.

==Geography==

Dorado is located in Puerto Rico&#x27;s Northern Karst region. Much of its geology consists of alluvial and coastal/estuarine sediments of Quaternary age and limestones of Tertiary age. The limestones are mostly in the south part of the municipality, in Espinosa, Maguayo and Rio Lajas barrios. These limestones exhibit mature karst topography of great beauty. It has been subjected to extensive quarrying, which have left unsightly scars in the landscape. Some local communities have gathered efforts to minimize quarrying and improve land management to protect the remaining karst topography and the fauna and flora that lives in it. Around 95% of Dorado&#x27;s terrain are flood plains while the rest is part of a limestone region. The terrains are naturally fertilized when the Dorado, Plata and Lajas rivers go out of their limits. The rock formation known as Ojo de Buey is tourist attraction, also being associated with legends of ghosts and the claim that the pirate captain Roberto Cofresí&#x27;s treasure is buried near it.

==Health care==
Dorado&#x27;s main health facility is a Center for Diagnostic and Treatment located at Road 698. The facility is able to handle emergency cases, but severe cases are transferred to bigger hospitals in nearby towns such as Bayamón or Manatí.

==Transportation==
Puerto Rico Highway 22 provides access to Dorado from the far away city of Mayagüez, or from San Juan. Road 165 also provides access from Cataño and Bayamón bordering the shore to the Atlantic Ocean. It takes approximately 30 minutes to reach the town from San Juan.

Like most other towns in the island, it has a public transportation system consisting of public cars. Taxis are also available around the town. There&#x27;s also a public trolley system around town and a shuttle service for handicapped people.

There are 19 bridges in Dorado.

Dorado Airport was a commercial airport that served the city with flights to San Juan and to the United States, but it has since been closed.

<text>B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith International ( ; from ) is a leading American 501(c)(3) nonprofit Jewish service organization and was formerly a cultural association for German Jewish immigrants to the United States. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith states that it is committed to the security and continuity of the Jewish people and the State of Israel and combating antisemitism and other forms of bigotry. 

Although the organization&#x27;s historic roots stem from a system of fraternal lodges and units in the late 19th century, as fraternal organizations declined throughout the United States, the organization evolved into a dual system of both lodges and units. The membership pattern became more common to other contemporary organizations of members affiliated by contribution in addition to formal dues paying members. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith has members, donors and supporters around the world.

==History==
B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith was founded in Aaron Sinsheimer&#x27;s café in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side on 13 October 1843, by 12 recent German Jewish immigrants led by Henry Jones. It was organized as a secret lodge. The new organization represented an attempt to organize Jews of the local community to confront what Isaac Rosenbourg, one of the founders, called &quot;the deplorable condition of Jews in this, our newly adopted country&quot;. The new group&#x27;s purpose, as described in its constitution, called for the traditional functions performed by Jewish societies in Europe: &quot;Visiting and attending the sick&quot; and &quot;protecting and assisting the widow and the orphan.&quot; Its founders had hoped that it soon would encompass all Jews in the United States, but this did not happen, since other Jewish organizations also were forming around the same time.

The German-speaking founders originally named the organization Bundes-Brüder (German for &quot;Brothers of the Covenant&quot;) to reflect their goal of a fraternal order that could provide comfort to the entire spectrum of Jewish Americans. Although early meetings were conducted in German, after a short time English emerged as the language of choice and the name was changed to B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. In the late 20th century, the translation was changed to the more contemporary and inclusive Children of the Covenant.

Despite its fraternal and local beginnings, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith spoke out for Jewish rights early in its history and used its growing national chain of lodges as a way to exercise political influence on behalf of world Jewry. In 1851, for example, it circulated petitions urging Secretary of State Daniel Webster to demand the end of Jewish disabilities in Switzerland, during on-going trade negotiations. Into the 1920s the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith continued in its political work by joining in Jewish delegations and lobbying efforts through which American Jews sought to influence public policy, both domestic and foreign. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith also played a crucial role in transnational Jewish politics. The later spread of the organization around the world made it a nerve center of intra-Jewish communication and mutual endeavor.

===1843 to early 1900s===
The organization&#x27;s activities during the 19th and 20th centuries were dominated by mutual aid, social service and philanthropy. In keeping with their concerns for protecting their families, the organization&#x27;s first concrete action was the establishment of an insurance policy awarding widows of deceased members $30 toward funeral expenses and a stipend of $1 a week for the rest of their life. To aid their children, each child would also receive a stipend and, for male children, the assurance he would be taught a trade.

In 1851, Covenant Hall was erected in New York City as the first Jewish community center in the United States, and also what is widely considered to be the first Jewish public library in the United States. One year later, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith established the Maimonides Library. Immediately following the Civil War—when Jews on both sides of the battle were left homeless—B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith founded the 200-bed Cleveland Jewish Orphan Home. Over the next several years, the organization would establish numerous hospitals, orphanages and homes for the aged.

In 1868, when a devastating flood crippled Baltimore, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith responded with a disaster relief campaign. This act preceded the founding of the American Red Cross by 13 years and was to be the first of many domestic relief programs. That same year, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith sponsored its first overseas philanthropic project raising $4,522 to aid the victims of a cholera epidemic in Ottoman Palestine.

In 1875, a lodge was established in Toronto, followed soon after by another in Montreal and in 1882 by a lodge in Berlin. Membership outside of the United States grew rapidly. Soon, lodges were formed in Cairo (1887) and in Jerusalem (1888—nine years before Theodor Herzl convened the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland). The Jerusalem lodge became the first public organization to hold all of its meetings in Hebrew.

After 1881, with the mass immigration of Eastern European Jews to the United States, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith sponsored Americanization classes, trade schools and relief programs. This began a period of rapid membership growth, a change in the system of representation and questioning of the secret rituals common to fraternal organizations. In 1897, when the organization&#x27;s U.S. membership numbered slightly more than 18,000, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith formed a ladies&#x27; auxiliary chapter in San Francisco. This was to become B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Women, which in 1988 broke away as an independent organization, Jewish Women International.

===Early 20th century===
In response to the Kishinev pogrom in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt and Secretary of State John Hay met with B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&#x27;s executive committee in Washington, D.C. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith President Simon Wolf presented the draft of a petition to be sent to the Russian government protesting the lack of opposition to the massacre. Roosevelt readily agreed to transmit it and B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith lodges began gathering signatures around the country.

In the first two decades of the 20th century, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith launched three of today&#x27;s major Jewish organizations: The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and BBYO (originally B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization). Later, they would take on a life of their own with varying degrees of autonomy.

A growing concern in the 1920s was the preservation of Jewish values as immigration slowed and a native Jewish population of Eastern European ancestry came to maturity. In 1923, Rabbi Benjamin Frankel of Illinois established Hillel – an organization on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to provide both Reform and Orthodox Sabbath services, classes in Judaism and social events for Jewish college students. Two years later, he approached B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith about adopting this new campus organization. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith sponsorship of the Hillel Foundations enabled it to extend throughout the United States, eventually become international and to grow into a network of more than 500 campus student organizations.

At virtually the same time as was being established, Sam Beber of Omaha, Nebraska, presented a plan in 1924 to B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith for a fraternity for Jewish men in high school. The new organization was called Aleph Zadik Aleph in imitation of the Greek-letter fraternities from which Jewish youth were excluded. In 1925, AZA became the junior auxiliary of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith.

In 1940, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Women adopted its own junior auxiliary for young women, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Girls (BBG, then a loose-knit group of organizations) and, in 1944, the two organizations became the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization (BBYO).

B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith has also been involved in Jewish camping for more than a half century. In 1953, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith acquired a camp in Pennsylvania&#x27;s Pocono Mountains. Originally named Camp B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, the facility would later be named B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Perlman Camp in honor of the early BBYO leader Anita Perlman and her husband, Louis. In 1976, a second camp was added near Madison, Wis. Named after the founder of AZA, the camp became known as B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Beber Camp. In 2010, Beber Camp became independent of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. Perlman Camp functions as both a Jewish children&#x27;s camp and as a leadership training facility.

In 1938 B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith established the Vocational Service Bureau to guide young people into careers. This evolved into the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Career and Counseling Service, an agency that provided vocational testing and counseling, and published career guides. In the mid-1980s, the program was dissolved or merged into other community agencies.

===1977 Hanafi siege===

On 9–11 March 1977, three buildings in Washington, D.C., including the headquarters of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, were seized by 12 black nationalist Nation of Islam gunmen, led by Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, who took 149 hostages and killed a radio journalist and a police officer. After a 39-hour standoff, all other hostages were released from the District Building (the city hall; now called the John A. Wilson Building), B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith headquarters, and the Islamic Center of Washington.

The gunmen had several demands. They &quot;wanted the government to hand over a group of men who had been convicted of killing seven relatives—mostly children—of takeover leader Hamaas Khaalis. They also demanded that the movie &quot;Mohammad, Messenger of God&quot; be destroyed because they considered it sacrilegious.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine noted: &quot;That the toll was not higher was in part a tribute to the primary tactic U.S. law enforcement officials are now using to thwart terrorists—patience. But most of all, perhaps, it was due to the courageous intervention of three Muslim ambassadors, Egypt&#x27;s Ashraf Ghorbal, Pakistan&#x27;s Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan and Iran&#x27;s Ardeshir Zahedi.&quot;

== Community service ==
From its earliest days, a hallmark of the organization&#x27;s local efforts was service to the communities in which members reside. In 1852, that meant raising money for the first Jewish hospital in Philadelphia.

With the ageing of the American Jewish population, service to seniors became a major focus with the first of what was to become a network of 36 senior residence buildings in more than 27 communities across the United States and more internationally; this made B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith the largest national Jewish sponsor of housing for seniors. The U.S. facilities, built in partnership with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provide housing to more than 6,000 men and women of limited income, age 62 and over, of all races and religions. Residents pay a federally mandated rent based upon income.

The beginning of the 21st century also saw the senior service program expand and become the Center for Senior Services.

B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith also includes, on its domestic agenda, tolerance issues such as advocating for hate crimes legislation as well as sponsoring a youth writing challenge, Diverse Minds. This annual writing contest asks high school students to create a children&#x27;s book dedicated to the message of ending intolerance and bigotry. Winners earn college scholarships and the publication and distribution of their books to schools and libraries in their communities.

B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith also sponsors the Enlighten America program, the centerpiece of which is a pledge that individuals can take to refrain from using slang expressions or telling jokes based on race, sexual orientation, gender, nationality or physical or mental challenges that would serve to demean another.

B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith also produces and distributes &quot;Smarter Kids – Safer Kids,&quot; a booklet in both English and Spanish meant to guide parents through discussions with their children about potential dangers.

=== Anti-defamation activities ===
The American-based international B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith organization founded the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith (ADL) as a response to attacks on Jews in the United States. The announcement of the creation of the ADL mentioned the Leo Frank lynching in particular. The ADL is now an independent organization.

In Australia and New Zealand, the local B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith has its own human rights section, called the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Anti-Defamation Commission (ADC). It is dedicated to eliminating the defamation of Jewish people, combating racism, intolerance, and prejudice. It seeks to secure justice and fair treatment for all citizens.

=== Educational programs and publications ===
Since 1886, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith has published B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Magazine, the oldest continually published Jewish periodical in the United States.

B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith also publishes program guides for local Jewish education programs and each year sponsors &quot;Unto Every Person There is a Name&quot;. This program includes community recitations of the names of Holocaust victims, usually on Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day.

In 1973, the organization converted a former exhibit hall at its Washington, D.C. headquarters into the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum. The museum featured an extensive collection of Jewish ceremonial objects and art and, for decades featured the 1790 correspondence between George Washington and Moses Seixas, sexton of the Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island. Although the organization&#x27;s move from its own building to rented offices necessitated closing of the museum to public view, select pieces of the collection are still on display at B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&#x27;s current headquarters and are available for viewing by appointment.

===Scholarships===
Every year, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith awards the Sally R. Schneider scholarship to a Jewish female graduate student who is studying in a field that will benefit humankind. The scholarship, which is worth $1,000, is named after Sally Schneider, a longtime B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith member who was passionate about pro-Israel advocacy and women&#x27;s education.

Local B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith lodges also award scholarships. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Great Lakes holds an annual golf classic, the proceeds of which fund several college scholarships each year.

=== Philatelic services ===
In affiliation with the United States Postal Service, the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Philatelic Service was involved in releasing a series of first day of issue stamps relating to prominent Jewish entrepreneurs, philanthropists, entertainers, and various Jewish organizations throughout the country.

=== Disaster relief ===
B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith has responded to natural and manmade disasters since 1865, when it assisted victims of a cholera epidemic in what was then Palestine. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith later raised funds and distributed them to those affected by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the Galveston, Texas, flood of 1900 and the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906.

In recent years, the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Disaster Relief Fund responded to the 2010 earthquakes in Haiti and Chile, the 2011 Japan tsunami and the multiple tornadoes and subsequent flooding that hit six states in the South and Midwest in 2011. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith also opened a disaster relief fund following the 2010 Mount Carmel forest fire and another fund to help victims of the worst drought to hit East Africa in more than 50 years.

In Haiti, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith raised $250,000 for shoes, medicine, health supplies and other needs immediately following the January 2010 earthquake that struck the island nation.

Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&#x27;s Young Professional Network in New York immediately began assisting in the cleanup. Members descended upon the Rockaways, and over several days helped remove debris and sand from buildings, extract moldy drywall and insulation, and remove water damaged furniture and appliances from homes. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith has also organised several fundraisers for future rebuilding projects.

Working with IsraAid, a Zionist humanitarian organization which brings together Israeli and Jewish organizations to form coordinated responses in the wake of humanitarian crises, the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Disaster Relief Fund allocated funds to survivors of the 2018 flooding in Japan.

The B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Disaster Relief Fund also helped after two US disasters, one in California and the other in Hawaii, in 2018. Wildfires struck communities in Southern California, and B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith contributed to the disaster recovery by assisting with the costs of food, utility bills and medical supplies for the Idyllwild HELP Center. Normally, the HELP Center is a charity and thrift store that helps needy individuals and families with the costs of food, utilities, housing and other basic needs. In the aftermath of the wildfires, the center helped fire victims.

In May 2019, the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Center for Senior Services (CSS) held its annual B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Managers and Service Coordinators Training meeting in Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from damage caused by 2017&#x27;s Hurricane Maria. In choosing to hold the meeting in Puerto Rico, the CSS team wanted to contribute to both Puerto Rico&#x27;s short-term recovery, by volunteering for a day of service with local non-profit organizations during their trip, and its long-term economic recovery, by bringing business to the island.

==International affairs==
B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith was present at the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco and has taken an active role in the world body ever since. In 1947, the organization was granted non-governmental organizational (NGO) status and, for many years, was the only Jewish organization with full-time representation at the United Nations. It is credited with a role in the U.N. reversal of its 1975 resolution equating Zionism with racism.

B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith also has worked with US officials in the State Department, in Congress, and with other governments to support the efforts of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to combat antisemitism. With members in more than 20 Latin American countries, the organization was the first Jewish group to be accorded civil society status at the Organization of American States (OAS), where it has advocated for democracy and human rights throughout the region.

In addition to its advocacy efforts, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith maintains a program of community service throughout Latin America. In 2002, in cooperation with the Brother&#x27;s Brother Foundation, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith distributed more than $31 million worth of medicine, books and supplies to Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Venezuela following the economic disaster that struck much of Latin America. Through 2011 the program had distributed more than $100 million in medicine and supplies.

=== Europe ===

By the 1920s, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith membership in Europe had grown to 17,500, nearly half of the U.S. membership, and by the next decade, the formation of a lodge in Shanghai (number 1102) represented the organization&#x27;s entry into the Far East. The Shanghai lodge established the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Foundation Polyclinic in 1934, later renamed the Shanghai Jewish Hospital.

B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Europe was re-founded in 1948. Members of the Basel and Zurich lodges and representatives from lodges in France and Netherlands who had survived the Holocaust attended the inaugural meeting. In 2000, the new European B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith district merged with the United Kingdom district to become a consolidated B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Europe with active involvement in all institutions of the European Union. By 2005 B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Europe comprised lodges in more than 20 countries including the former Communist Eastern Europe.

In 1943, in response to what would later become known as the Holocaust, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith President Henry Monsky convened a conference in Pittsburgh of all major Jewish organizations to &quot;find a common platform for the presentation of our case before the civilized nations of the world&quot;.

=== Israel and the Middle East ===

Just prior to the creation of the State of Israel, President Harry S. Truman, resisting pressure by various organizations, declined meetings with Jewish leaders. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith President Frank Goldman convinced fellow B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith member Eddie Jacobson, long-time friend and business partner of the president, to appeal to Truman for a favor. Jacobson convinced Truman to meet secretly with Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann in a meeting said to have resulted in turning White House support back in favor of partition, and ultimately to de facto recognition of Israeli statehood.

In addition to founding the Jerusalem Lodge in 1888, life in Israel has been a prime focus for the organization. Among the Jerusalem lodge&#x27;s most noted contributions was the city&#x27;s first free public library, Midrash Abarbanel.

In 1959, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith became the first major American Jewish organization to hold a convention in Israel.

In 1980, nearly all nations removed their embassies from Jerusalem in response to the passage by the Knesset of the Jerusalem Law extending Israeli sovereignty over the entire city. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith responded with the establishment of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith World Center in Jerusalem to serve as &quot;the permanent and official presence of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith in Jerusalem.&quot;

==Awards ==
The Presidential Gold Medal is awarded by B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith every few years to honor the recipient&#x27;s commitment to the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Recipients have included David Ben-Gurion, John F. Kennedy, George H. W. Bush, Stephen Harper and Golda Meir. The Gold Medal has been given to former Austrian chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, former German Chancellor Willy Brandt and former U.S. presidents Harry S. Truman, Gerald R. Ford and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

The B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith book award was established in 1970. The first recipient was Ronald Sanders for his work &quot;The Downtown Jews&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a Sheffer sequence or poweroid is a polynomial sequence, i.e., a sequence of polynomials in which the index of each polynomial equals its degree, satisfying conditions related to the umbral calculus in combinatorics. They are named for Isador M. Sheffer.

==Definition==
Fix a polynomial sequence (&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Define a linear operator &quot;Q&quot; on polynomials in &quot;x&quot; by
formula_1

This determines &quot;Q&quot; on all polynomials. The polynomial sequence &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a &quot;Sheffer sequence&quot; if the linear operator &quot;Q&quot; just defined is &quot;shift-equivariant&quot;; such a &quot;Q&quot; is then a delta operator. Here, we define a linear operator &quot;Q&quot; on polynomials to be &quot;shift-equivariant&quot; if, whenever &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;a&quot;) = &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot; &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a &quot;shift&quot; of &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), then (&quot;Qf&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) = (&quot;Qg&quot;)(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;a&quot;); i.e., &quot;Q&quot; commutes with every shift operator: &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;Q&quot; = &quot;QT&quot;&quot;a&quot;.

==Properties==

The set of all Sheffer sequences is a group under the operation of umbral composition of polynomial sequences, defined as follows. Suppose ( &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;(x) : &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... ) and ( &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;(x) : &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... ) are polynomial sequences, given by
formula_2

Then the umbral composition formula_3 is the polynomial sequence whose &quot;n&quot;th term is
formula_4
(the subscript &quot;n&quot; appears in &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;, since this is the &quot;n&quot; term of that sequence, but not in &quot;q&quot;, since this refers to the sequence as a whole rather than one of its terms).

The identity element of this group is the standard monomial basis
formula_5

Two important subgroups are the group of Appell sequences, which are those sequences for which the operator &quot;Q&quot; is mere differentiation, and the group of sequences of binomial type, which are those that satisfy the identity
formula_6
A Sheffer sequence ( &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) : &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ... ) is of binomial type if and only if both
formula_7
and
formula_8

The group of Appell sequences is abelian; the group of sequences of binomial type is not. The group of Appell sequences is a normal subgroup; the group of sequences of binomial type is not. The group of Sheffer sequences is a semidirect product of the group of Appell sequences and the group of sequences of binomial type. It follows that each coset of the group of Appell sequences contains exactly one sequence of binomial type. Two Sheffer sequences are in the same such coset if and only if the operator &quot;Q&quot; described above – called the &quot;delta operator&quot; of that sequence – is the same linear operator in both cases. (Generally, a &quot;delta operator&quot; is a shift-equivariant linear operator on polynomials that reduces degree by one. The term is due to F. Hildebrandt.)

If &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a Sheffer sequence and &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the one sequence of binomial type that shares the same delta operator, then
formula_9

Sometimes the term &quot;Sheffer sequence&quot; is &quot;defined&quot; to mean a sequence that bears this relation to some sequence of binomial type. In particular, if ( &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ) is an Appell sequence, then
formula_10

The sequence of Hermite polynomials, the sequence of Bernoulli polynomials, and the monomials ( &quot;xn&quot; : &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ... ) are examples of Appell sequences.

A Sheffer sequence &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; is characterised by its exponential generating function
formula_11
where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are (formal) power series in &quot;t&quot;. Sheffer sequences are thus examples of generalized Appell polynomials and hence have an associated recurrence relation.

==Examples==
Examples of polynomial sequences which are Sheffer sequences include:
* The Abel polynomials;
* The Bernoulli polynomials;
* The Euler polynomial;
* The central factorial polynomials;
* The Hermite polynomials;
* The Laguerre polynomials;
* The monomials ( &quot;xn&quot; : &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ... );
* The Mott polynomials;
* The Bernoulli polynomials of the second kind;
* The Falling and rising factorials;
* The Touchard polynomials;
* The Mittag-Leffler polynomials;

<text>Dorado Airport or Dorado Beach Airport was a small single runway airport in Dorado, Puerto Rico.

Clara Livingston, the owner of the property at the time, ordered the strip be built, and her friend, Amelia Earhart, may have used the facility as well. Later on, the United States military, during World War II, paved the runway.

Much later on, a large airline named Caribair (later overtaken by Eastern Air Lines), began flights there. When Caribair became part of Eastern, flights to Dorado Airport were suspended.

During the mid 1960s, Dorado was served by Dorado Wings (later renamed Crown Air), a small airline that operated charter flights between Dorado Airport and Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan. The airline operated propeller airplanes.

In the early 1990s, the airport was officially closed. In 1996, the parcel was rezoned and construction commenced of a master planned community: Dorado Beach East. In memory of Dorado Airport and its founder, Ms. Clara Livingston, the developers built a children&#x27;s playground themed with unique play airplanes, a hangar for activities, and a runway plaza.

<doc id="218599" wikidata="Q27184" url="?curid=218599" title="Jive Records">
<text>Jive Records (later stylized as JIVE Records) was a British-American independent record label founded by Clive Calder in 1981 as a subsidiary of the Zomba Group. In the US, the label had offices in New York City and Chicago. Jive was best known for its successes with hip hop, R&amp;B, and dance acts in the 1980s and 1990s, along with teen pop and boy bands during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Jive was acquired by Bertelsmann Music Group in 2002. In 2008, BMG itself was bought out by Sony Music Entertainment. Jive Records thereupon remained a unit wholly owned by Sony up until the label’s dissolution in 2011, when Jive was absorbed into RCA Records.

==History==
===1970s: Beginnings===
In 1971, South African businessmen Clive Calder and Ralph Simon began a publishing and management company. It was named Zomba Records and relocated to London, England, four years later; their first client was a young Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. Zomba originally wanted to avoid record labels to instead focus on their songwriters and producers while allowing other established labels to release the material. Later that decade, the company opened offices in the US, where Calder began a business relationship with Clive Davis, whose Arista Records began releasing material by Zomba artists. 

===Formation and early distribution at Arista and RCA (1981)===
In 1981, Zomba formed Jive Records, whose operations began with the release of British dance and pop music from groups such as Q-Feel, A Flock of Seagulls, and Tight Fit. Its name was inspired by township Jive, a type of music that originated in South Africa. Clive Davis had hoped that Zomba&#x27;s connection with Mutt Lange would help alleviate the difficulties Arista was having with launching rock acts to success.

=== Hip hop sprawl and rise in popularity (1982–1995) ===

By 1982, Calder was introduced to Barry Weiss, a young college graduate who took Calder out to hip-hop clubs in New York City for his job interview with Zomba. Weiss and Calder began grooming musicians for what would eventually become the hip hop group Whodini. After two days, the group created and recorded its hit single &quot;Magic&#x27;s Wand.&quot; While the group would eventually leave Jive, the early success allowed the label to focus on hip-hop artists throughout the 1980s. 

In 1987, Jive cut distribution ties with Arista, effectively separating them from Davis, who eschewed hip hop music at his label. As the 1980s drew to a close, the label entered a distribution deal with Arista&#x27;s sister label RCA Records, and it continued to sign hip hop acts including DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, Boogie Down Productions, Too $hort, Schoolly D, and Kid Rock.

In 1990, Calder bought Simon’s stake in Zomba and became the sole owner of Jive Records. Jive&#x27;s distribution deal with RCA expired in 1991. At this time, Bertelsmann Music Group acquired a minority share of the label and began to distribute its records directly. Weiss became chief executive of Jive Records that year. Jive opened branches in Chicago and had also become a premier label in the genres of hip hop and R&amp;B with the success of acts like D-Nice, E-40, UGK, A Tribe Called Quest, Hi-Five, KRS-One/Boogie Down Productions, R. Kelly and Aaliyah.

=== Teen pop acts (1996–2001) ===
In 1996, BMG deepened its relationship with the label by purchasing a 20-percent stake of Jive. By the late 1990s, Jive began signing pop acts Backstreet Boys, NSYNC and Britney Spears. All three acts achieved massive success as the 2000s dawned, becoming the three best-selling acts in the label&#x27;s history.

===2000s: Acquisition by BMG and Sony===
In 2002, Calder sold Zomba to BMG for US$2.74 billion, which at the time was the largest-ever acquisition of an independent label with major-label distribution. Calder then announced his resignation from Zomba, but continued to stay on at Jive in a temporary advisory role as Zomba was integrated into BMG. Weiss succeeded Calder as the new head of Zomba. In 2004, BMG merged with Sony Music Entertainment to form Sony BMG. During this time, Jive&#x27;s management and distribution were restructured under the newly formed Zomba Label Group. Artists who had previously been on LaFace and Arista Records were subsequently absorbed under the Zomba group and placed under the purview of Jive Records’ staff. Thus, artists such as Pink, Usher, and Outkast became de facto Jive artists. Though both physical record sales and teen pop had steadily declined since the early 2000s, the output from Jive’s newer artists — particularly Usher’s &quot;Confessions&quot; album and Outkast’s &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; — would prove to be profitable successes for Jive. In addition to releasing Spears’ 2007 album &quot;Blackout&quot;, Jive was now also the home of a solo Justin Timberlake, whose &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot; also saw high sales. Other Jive artists at that time included Ciara and Chris Brown.

By early 2008, the BMG Label Group was said to include RCA Records, J Records, LaFace, Arista, Volcano Entertainment, Verity, GospoCentric and Fo Yo Soul — all overseen by Weiss. Later that year, Sony and BMG dissolved its merger, with the former buying out shares of the latter. As a result of Sony&#x27;s buyout, Jive (along with its BMG sisters RCA and Arista) became a wholly owned unit of a refreshed Sony Music Entertainment. Starting in 2008 Jive was all capital (e.g. JIVE Records), this change started when BMG Label Group was renamed RCA/JIVE Label Group.

===2010s: Dormancy===
After two decades as president of Jive, Barry Weiss left for Universal Music Group in March 2011. On October 7, 2011, it was announced that Jive, along with Arista and J Records, would be retired to refresh and re-brand RCA Records by not confusing or diluting it with other labels. All retained artists on those labels were then moved to RCA Records.

The label is currently in hibernation, with the distribution of its back catalog handled by Sony Music&#x27;s Legacy Recordings. Previously, the Jive brand was being exclusively used under the Sony Music France division under the name Jive Epic in France until 2019, when it was absorbed into RCA Records France.

==R. Kelly controversy==
On September 27, 2021, singer R. Kelly was found guilty by a federal jury of acts including bribery and sexual exploitation of a child. Allegations of Kelly’s sexual misconduct had long followed the singer since his early career with Jive in the early 1990s, as well as throughout the 2000s when a video tape surfaced allegedly showing Kelly engaging in sexual acts with a minor and when Kelly was arrested for possession of child pornography.

Despite the scandals, Kelly remained signed to Jive’s roster and continued to release albums with the label up to its merger with RCA in 2011. In 2018, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; ran a lengthy article alleging industry executives at Jive had been aware of Kelly&#x27;s sexually abusive behavior towards young women for years, but did nothing about them due to his success as a performer and songwriter. The article reported Clive Calder had been warned about Kelly’s behavior as early as 1994; it quoted him: &quot;Clearly, we missed something.&quot;

Former Jive president Barry Weiss told the newspaper that during his 20 years with the label, he never concerned himself with Kelly&#x27;s private life, and was unaware of two lawsuits filed against Kelly and the label by women alleging sexual misconduct, suits in which the label had successfully argued it was not liable. Larry Khan, another Jive executive who worked closely with the singer even after viewing the sex tape, similarly implied Kelly’s misconduct was not the label&#x27;s responsibility and pointed to Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis as musicians whose labels also continued to release and promote their records despite public awareness that they were involved with underage girls.

<text>Melissa Janis Lefton (born August 13, 1975) is a singer and songwriter.

Lefton began playing keyboards at the age of 10. After finishing high-school she moved to New York to study communications at New York University, though decided to also focus on a career in music while studying. Melissa joined the punk rock band &quot;Product&quot; answering an ad in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; seeking a &quot;theatrical female frontperson&quot; who &quot;wanted to be a star.&quot; Product played at venues including CBGB. They were signed and recorded an album though its release was cancelled.

Her debut solo album, &quot;Melicious&quot;, signed to Jive Records, was slated for release on August 21, 2001, but was also never released. &quot;Melicious&quot; took on topics like pollution, date-rape, occultism and murder, with tongue in cheek. Stylus Magazine gave Melicious a positive review and referred to Lefton as the &quot;queen of shelved teenpop&quot;. AllMusic also spoke highly of the album, saying it &quot;matches the pop sassiness of the Go-Go&#x27;s and Cyndi Lauper&quot;. Lefton was also once referred to as the &quot;anti-Britney.&quot; &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; called her &quot;cute, perky and evil incarnate.&quot;

Three of Lefton&#x27;s songs from 2001 were commercially released. &quot;I Love Life&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;. &quot;My Hit Song&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;On the Line&quot; and also appeared on the compilation album &quot;Cool Traxx! 3&quot;. Her cover of &quot;He Blinded Me with Science&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;. Her track &quot;Radio Rainbow&quot; appears in the film &quot;Halloweentown II: Kalabar&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, though the film did not release an accompanying soundtrack.

In an attempt to salvage her career, the label set her up with a manager who sent her to Los Angeles to become an actress. Discouraged with the roles she was offered she returned to New York City. She spent several years working professionally as a commercial jingle writer; Lefton&#x27;s vocals can be heard in the famous commercial for Pepsi by Britney Spears as well as ads for T.J. Maxx and Chevrolet. By 2006, Lefton was in a sunshine pop band named &quot;Hello&quot;. That year they released an album on the record label &quot;Frisbie&quot;.

<text>Melicious is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Melissa Lefton. It was intended for release on August 21, 2001, by Jive Records, however, it was delayed indefinitely. The album was produced by The Matrix and explores a variety of eccentric topics through a satirical lens. &quot;Melicious&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics, with many praising the radio-friendly nature of the album and the unorthodox themes explored throughout it. Prior to the album&#x27;s shelving, a mockumentary titled &quot;Behind the Muse&quot; was produced in order to promote &quot;Melicious&quot;. Two songs from the album were commercially released; &quot;My Hit Song&quot; and &quot;I Love Life&quot; were included on the soundtracks to the films &quot;On the Line&quot; and &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, respectively.

== Background ==
The album was originally stated to be due for release on August 21, 2001 on Jive Records. It was later said to be due for release in Spring 2002, but was eventually suspended indefinitely. The album was produced by The Matrix.

The only copies of the album that exist are full length promotional copies, none of which include the publicized album cover. There are two variations: one is an acetate promo which has a stick-on label and comes in an orange jewel case. The other comes in a cardboard sleeve and features Lefton in a T-shirt with a jolly roger on it. A three song sampler also exists which plays the songs &quot;My Hit Song,&quot; &quot;Ozone&quot; and &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot;.

Melicious took on topics like pollution, sugar daddies, occultism and murder, with tongue in cheek lyrics.

Two songs on this album were commercially released on other albums. &quot;I Love Life&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;. Commenting on the soundtrack Heather Phares from &quot;AllMusic&quot; spoke favourably of the track. &quot;My Hit Song&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;On the Line&quot; and also appeared on the compilation album &quot;Cool Traxx! 3&quot;. Heather Phares said the track was &quot;sending up and relishing teen pop&#x27;s plastic sound and mindless appeal&quot;. The track &quot;Radio Rainbow&quot; appears in the film &quot;Halloweentown II: Kalabar&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, though the film did not release an accompanying soundtrack.

== Promotion ==
A promotional short film was created to promote the album. Called &quot;Behind the Muse&quot;, it was a mockumentary spoofing the &quot;Behind the Music&quot; program and format. In it, Lefton is depicted as an already-famous musician who rose to fame as a pop star only to succumb to an IV addiction to SunnyD. After a nearly fatal car crash she records a critically panned album titled &quot;Ouch!&quot;, and then revitalizes her career as a Las Vegas lounge singer. The humor in the film is decidedly not for young people; for example, regarding her addiction, Lefton states: &quot;I was making love to sweaty bums just to score a hit of SunnyD, and it didn&#x27;t feel good on my vagina.&quot; The film was promotionally distributed on VHS and MiniDV tapes.

== Critical reception ==
The month before it was due for release, the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; gave a favourable review of the album, as did the Autumn 2001 edition of &quot;Elle Girl&quot;. MacKenzie Wilson from &quot;AllMusic&quot; also spoke highly of the album, saying it &quot;matches the pop sassiness of the Go-Go&#x27;s and Cyndi Lauper&quot;. Jimmy Draper from &quot;AllMusic&quot; gave the album four stars out of five, concluding &quot;This isn&#x27;t your typical Top 40 fodder because, thankfully, there isn&#x27;t anything typical about Lefton&#x27;s surprisingly enjoyable and energetic debut.&quot; Five years after it was cancelled, Stylus Magazine gave the album a positive review and referred to Lefton as the &quot;queen of shelved teenpop&quot;.

<text>The Regionalverband Saarbrücken is a &quot;Kommunalverband besonderer Art&quot;, an integration of a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) and a district-free town. It is located in the south of the Saarland, Germany. Neighboring districts are Saarlouis, Neunkirchen, Saar-Pfalz, and Forbach-Boulay-Moselle and Sarreguemines in the French &quot;département&quot; Moselle.

==History==
The district Saarbrücken was originally created in 1816.
In 1974, the district and the district-free city Saarbrücken were merged, and the new administrative body was named &quot;Stadtverband Saarbrücken&quot;. Although it&#x27;s not a district like others, most of its administrative tasks are the same as those of a district.

On November 21, 2007, the governing majority of the CDU in the parliament of Saarland passed a law which transformed the &quot;Stadtverband Saarbrücken&quot; into the &quot;Regionalverband Saarbrücken&quot; on January 1, 2008. The most striking change by this transformation was the introduction of the &quot;Kooperationsrat&quot;, a council of officials of the towns and municipalities which exercises some of the powers of Municipal corporation alongside the district council (&quot;Regionalversammlung&quot;, the local equivalent of the Kreistag). As the directly elected &quot;Regionalversammlung&quot; represents the population, while the members of the &quot;Kooperationsrat&quot; are picked by the towns or municipalities which they represent, there is a debate whether the competences of the not-directly-elected &quot;Kooperationsrat&quot; infringe on the constitutional right of the directly elected &quot;Regionalversammlung&quot; to exert all powers of Municipal corporation.

The river Saar flows through the district, through the city Saarbrücken in the center of the district.

==Coat of arms==
The original district had no coat of arms, the Regionalverband uses a coat derived from the one of the Counts of Nassau-Saarbrücken. The silver lion is taken from the County of Saarbrücken, the golden lion is the lion of Nassau.

==Towns and municipalities==

==Politics==
The bodies of the district &quot;Regionalverband&quot; are the administrator &quot;Regionalverbandsdirektor&quot;, the district council &quot;Regionalversammlung&quot; and the additional council &quot;Kooperationsrat&quot;, which is mainly composed of officials of the towns and municipalities.

===District administration===
On January 1, 2008, Ulf Huppert (FDP) became &quot;Beauftragter für das Amt des Regionalverbandsdirektors&quot;, temporarily acting as Regionalverbandsdirektor.

The first ever election of the Regionalverbandsdirektor was held on June 7, 2009. As no candidate gained an absolute majority in the first round, run-off elections were held On June 21, 2009, which were won by Peter Gillo (SPD) with 60.22%, with Rainer Grün (CDU) taking 39.78% of the votes. Gillo beat Grün in all towns and municipalities except Püttlingen. The turnout rate of the run-off elections was just 21.2%.

<text>David Martin Scott Steel, Baron Steel of Aikwood (born 31 March 1938) is a retired Scottish politician. Elected as Member of Parliament for Roxburgh, Selkirk, and Peebles, followed by Tweeddale, Ettrick, and Lauderdale, he served as the final leader of the Liberal Party, from 1976 to 1988. His tenure spanned the duration of the alliance with the Social Democratic Party, which began in 1981 and concluded with the formation of the Liberal Democrats in 1988.

Steel served as a Member of the UK Parliament for 32 years, from 1965 to 1997, and as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999 to 2003, during which time he was the parliament&#x27;s Presiding Officer. He was a member of the House of Lords as a life peer from 1997 to 2020. Steel resigned from the House of Lords after the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse accused him of an &quot;abdication of responsibility&quot; over his failure to investigate allegations of child sex abuse against the former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith.

==Early life and education==

Steel was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, the son of a Church of Scotland minister also called David Steel, who would later serve as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He was brought up in Scotland and Kenya, and educated at Dumbarton Academy; James Gillespie&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School, Edinburgh; the Prince of Wales School, Nairobi; and George Watson&#x27;s College, Edinburgh, followed by the University of Edinburgh, where he first took an active part in Liberal politics, and was elected Senior President of the Students&#x27; Representative Council, and graduated in Law.

==Political career==

After university, Steel worked for the Scottish Liberal Party, and then the BBC, before being elected to the House of Commons as the MP for Roxburgh, Selkirk, and Peebles at the 1965 by-election, just before his 27th birthday, becoming the &quot;Baby of the House&quot;. He represented this seat until 1983, when he was elected in Tweeddale, Ettrick, and Lauderdale, a new constituency covering much of the same territory. From 1966 to 1970, Steel was president of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement campaign.

As an MP, Steel was responsible for introducing, as a Private member&#x27;s bill, the Abortion Act 1967, and has argued for greater liberalisation of this legislation in recent years (see Abortion in the United Kingdom). He also became the Liberal Party&#x27;s spokesman on employment, and, in 1970, its Chief Whip.

===Leader of Liberal Party===
In 1976, following the downfall of Jeremy Thorpe, and a short period in which Jo Grimond acted as caretaker leader, he won the Liberal leadership by a wide margin over John Pardoe. At only 38 years old, he was one of the youngest party leaders in British history. In March 1977, he led the Liberals into the &quot;Lib–Lab pact&quot;. The Liberals agreed to support the Labour government, whose narrow majority since the general election in October 1974 had been gradually eroded and left them as a minority government, in power, in return for a degree of prior consultation on policy. This pact lasted until August 1978.

Steel was criticised, both then and since, for not driving a harder bargain. However, Steel&#x27;s defenders contend that the continuing scandal surrounding Thorpe left the party in a very weak state to face an early general election, and Steel was wise to buy himself some time from Prime Minister James Callaghan. At the same time, the growing unpopularity of the Labour government impaired the Liberals&#x27; performance, and Steel&#x27;s first election as leader, the 1979 general election, saw a net two-seat loss for the Liberals.

===SDP–Liberal Alliance===
In 1981, a group of Labour moderates left their party to form the Social Democratic Party. They were joined by the former Labour deputy leader, Chancellor and Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, who had previously had discussions with Steel about joining the Liberals. Under Jenkins&#x27; leadership, the SDP joined the Liberals in the SDP–Liberal Alliance. In its early days, the Alliance showed so much promise that for a time, it looked like the Liberals would be part of a government for the first time since 1945. Opinion polls were showing Alliance support as high as 50% by late 1981. Steel was so confident that he felt able to tell delegates at the Liberal Assembly that year: &quot;Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government.&quot; In the wake of the 1981 Croydon North West by-election, where Liberal candidate Bill Pitt came from third position to easily gain the Alliance&#x27;s first by-election victory, Steel&#x27;s reaction to the result was to state that his belief &quot;that we are now unstoppable.&quot;

Steel had genuine hopes at that stage that the Alliance would win the next general election and form a coalition government. However, the beginning of the Falklands War the following spring radically shifted the attitude of the electorate, and the Conservatives regained the lead in polls from the Alliance by a wide margin. The Alliance secured more than 25% of the vote at the 1983 general election, almost as many votes as Labour. However, its support was spread out across the country, and was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into seats under the first past the post system. This left the Alliance with only 23 seats — 17 for the Liberals, and six for the SDP. Steel&#x27;s dreams of a big political breakthrough were left unfulfilled.

Shortly afterwards, the former Labour Foreign Secretary David Owen replaced Jenkins as leader of the SDP, and the troubled leadership of the &quot;Two Davids&quot; was inaugurated. It was never an easy relationship—Steel&#x27;s political sympathies were well to the left of Owen&#x27;s. Owen had a marked antipathy towards the Liberals, though he respected Steel&#x27;s prior loyalty to his own party contrasting it with Jenkins&#x27; lack of interest in preserving the SDP&#x27;s independence. The relationship was also mercilessly satirised by &quot;Spitting Image&quot; which portrayed Steel as a squeaky voiced midget, literally in the pocket of Owen. Steel has often stated that he feels this portrayal seriously damaged his image. This portrayal of Steel as weaker than Owen was also present in other satires, such as &quot;Private Eye&quot;″s &quot;Battle for Britain&quot; strip. The relationship finally fell apart during the 1987 general election when the two contradicted each other, both on defence policy and on which party they would do a deal with in the event of a hung parliament.

===Two parties merge===

Steel was convinced the answer to these difficulties was a single party with a single leader, and was the chief proponent of the 1988 merger between the Liberals and the SDP. He emerged victorious in persuading both parties to accept merger in the teeth of opposition from Owen and radical Liberals such as Michael Meadowcroft, but badly mishandled the issuing of a joint policy document. Steel had often been criticised for a lack of interest in policy, and it appeared he had agreed to the document – drawn up by politically naive SDP advisers – without reading it. His colleagues rejected it immediately and demanded a redraft, fatally wounding his authority.

Steel was briefly joint interim leader of the Social and Liberal Democrats (as the new party was at first called) in the run-up to elections in which he did not stand, before becoming the party&#x27;s foreign affairs spokesman. In 1989, he accepted an invitation from Italian Liberals to stand for the European Parliament in the 1989 election as a Pan-European gesture, but was not elected.

Steel became President of the Liberal International in 1994, holding the office until 1996.

=== Life peerage and Scottish Parliament ===
Steel retired from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election and was made a life peer as Baron Steel of Aikwood, of Ettrick Forest in the Scottish Borders, on 6 June 1997. He campaigned for Scottish devolution, and in 1999 was elected to the Scottish Parliament as a Liberal Democrat MSP for Lothians. He became the first Presiding Officer (speaker) of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999.

In this role, he used the style &quot;Sir David Steel&quot;, despite his peerage. He suspended his Liberal Democrat membership for the duration of his tenure as Presiding Officer, believing that the post, like the Speaker of the UK House of Commons, should be strictly nonpartisan. All subsequent Presiding Officers have followed this practice.

Steel stepped down as an MSP when the parliament was dissolved for the 2003 election, but remained as Presiding Officer until he had supervised the election of his successor George Reid on 7 May of that year. He was appointed Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in both 2003 and 2004.

=== Cyril Smith child sex abuse scandal ===
On 14 March 2019, Steel was suspended by the Liberal Democrats after an admission that discussions he had conducted in 1979 with the then Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith, at a time when Steel was leader of the Liberal Party, had led him to conclude that Smith had been a sexual abuser of children in the 1960s and that Steel nonetheless failed to instigate any assessment by the party of whether Smith was an on-going risk to children. Richard Scorer, representing victims at the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, called for him to be stripped of his peerage. On 14 May 2019, the Liberal Democrats ruled that there were &quot;no grounds for action&quot; against Steel and reinstated him to party membership.

On 25 February 2020, Steel announced his resignation from the Liberal Democrats and subsequently his position as a member of the House of Lords, after admitting that during his leadership of the Liberal Party he &quot;assumed&quot; that Smith had been a child abuser, and failed to investigate claims made by &quot;Private Eye&quot; against Smith, dating from before Smith was a party member. This came about after the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse accused Steel of an &quot;abdication of responsibility&quot; over allegations against Smith. He retired officially from the House of Lords on 27 March 2020.

==Honours and awards==

Steel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1990 New Year Honours for political and public service. On 30 November 2004, Queen Elizabeth created Lord Steel a Knight of the Order of the Thistle, the highest honour in Scotland.

He has also received numerous foreign honours, including: Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit (Germany) in 1992;
Chevalier in the Légion d&#x27;Honneur (France) in 2003; and Honorary Knight of the Order of St. George (Habsburg-Lorraine) in 2016.

Steel has received a number of Honorary Doctorates from many universities including Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Stirling.

==Personal life and family==
Steel married fellow law graduate Judith Mary MacGregor in October 1962. They resided at Aikwood Tower in the Borders of Scotland for twenty years, but now live in Selkirk. They have two sons and a daughter, and nine grandchildren. In 1995, his elder son Graeme was convicted for growing cannabis at his house, and sent to prison for nine months. One of his granddaughters, Hannah, was elected to Scottish Borders Council (representing the Galashiels and District ward) in the 2022 Scottish local elections.

His recreations are angling and classic car rallying: he won the bronze medallion in 1998 for London to Cape Town. He is a member of the National Liberal and Royal Over-Seas League clubs.

Steel was featured in his own episode of the Channel 4 documentary series &quot;Empire&#x27;s Children&quot; (2007) which explored his family background, particularly his father&#x27;s attempt to save the African people from British internment camps during the Mau Mau rebellion.

<text>The Bush School is the only independent private K–12 school in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1924 by Helen Taylor Bush, The Bush School today enrolls 735 students. As of 2020, school review website Niche ranks the Bush School as the best private K-12 school in Washington state and the 4th best private prep and high school in the Washington state.

== History ==

In 1924, Helen Taylor Bush, a supporter of John Dewey&#x27;s philosophy of progressive education, opened a preschool and kindergarten in her home to six students. In 1929, the school, having grown to six grades, the school was organized as a nonprofit corporation with a board of trustees. The Helen Bush School for Girls formally began in 1930.

In 1941, Bush helped organize the Pacific Northwest Association of Independent Schools, now called NWAIS.

Gracemont became part of the Bush School campus in 1944. The house itself, plus the carriage house and the grounds, were transferred to Mrs. Bush by Grace Heffernan Arnold. Gracemont continues to serve as a classroom and administrative building for the Upper School.

In 1968 the boarding program was phased out.

The school was formally renamed the Bush School in 1970 and began enrolling boys in the Upper School, making it Seattle&#x27;s only K–12 coeducational independent school.

In 1986, the Bush School completed two capital campaigns that dated back to 1972 resulting in a faculty endowment, renovations to its Gracemont building, and construction of the Commons, a new gym, an art building, administrative offices, Benaroya, and the urban courtyard.

Construction of the Lower Campus including the Lower School classrooms, Community Room, library, Mag Gym, turf field, play structure, and the parking structure was completed in 2006.

In 2016, The Bush School acquired a second campus, called the Bush Methow Campus, in Mazama, Washington. The twenty-acre campus and educational facility, formerly known as the North Cascades Basecamp, integrates wilderness, cultural, and academic experiential learning.

== School traditions ==

Inquiry-based and experiential learning is a longstanding tradition of the Bush School, which is manifested in field trips for students in each of the school&#x27;s divisions, as well as international travel and wilderness outings for older students. Winter sports also are a focus of its experiential learning program, and the school holds a mountaineering class at Snoqualmie Pass and also a winter sports wilderness program including snowshoeing, ice skating, cross-country skiing, snow hiking and learning about winter wildlife. The school also encourages students to explore cultural, natural and historical sites.
