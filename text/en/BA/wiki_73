<doc id="222627" wikidata="Q2143750" url="?curid=222627" title="List of railway companies">
<text>This is an incomplete list of the world&#x27;s [[Rail transport|railway]] operating companies listed alphabetically by continent and country. This list includes companies operating both now and in the past.

In some countries, the railway operating bodies are not companies, but are government departments or authorities.
Particularly in many European countries beginning in the late-1980s, with privatizations and the separation of the track ownership and management from running the trains, there are now many track-only companies and train-only companies.

<text>Culture are a Jamaican roots reggae group founded in 1976. Originally they were known as the African Disciples. The one constant member until his death in 2006 was Joseph Hill.

== History ==
The group formed in 1976 as the vocal trio of Joseph Hill (formerly a percussionist in Studio One house band the Soul Defenders), his cousin Albert &quot;Ralph&quot; Walker, and Roy &quot;Kenneth&quot; Dayes, initially using the name The African Disciples. Roy Dayes also used the name &quot;Kenneth Paley&quot;, which is the name that appears on the Culture records released by Virgin Records. The African Disciples soon changed their name to Culture, and auditioned successfully for the &quot;Mighty Two&quot;: producer Joe Gibbs and engineer Errol Thompson. While at Gibbs&#x27; studio, they recorded a series of singles, starting with &quot;See Dem a Come&quot; and including &quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot; (which predicted the apocalypse on 7 July 1977), many of which ended up on their debut album &quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot;. The song was sufficiently influential that many in Kingston stayed indoors on 7 July, fearing that the prophecy would come true. A second Gibbs-produced album, &quot;Baldhead Bridge&quot;, followed in 1978, by which time the group had moved on to record for producer Sonia Pottinger. The group entered into a long-running dispute with Gibbs over royalties to the first album.

&quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot; meanwhile had become a big seller in the United Kingdom, popular with punk rock fans as well as reggae fans and boosted by the support of John Peel on his BBC Radio 1 show, and reached number 60 on the UK Albums Chart in April 1978. This prompted Virgin Records to sign the group to its Front Line label, releasing &quot;Harder than the Rest&quot; (1978) and &quot;International Herb&quot; (1979). Culture also released records on other labels in Jamaica, including a dub version of &quot;Harder than the Rest&quot;, &quot;Culture in Dub&quot; (1978, High Note), and an album of different recordings of the same album, &quot;Africa Stand Alone&quot; (April 1978). An album recorded for Pottinger in 1979 with a working title of &quot;Black Rose&quot; remained unreleased until tracks emerged in 1993 on &quot;Trod On&quot;.

Culture performed at the One Love Peace Concert in 1978.

In 1981 the three singers went their own ways. Hill carried on using the Culture name, and recorded the &quot;Lion Rock&quot; album, which was reissued in the United States by Heartbeat Records. Hill and his new band recorded a session for long time supporter John Peel in December 1982, and the group went on to record further studio sessions for Peel in 1998 and 2002, and their performance at the Royal Festival Hall in July 1998 was broadcast on his show. For their part, Walker and Dayes recorded a handful of songs on their own; a few of which turned up on an album titled &quot;Roots &amp; Culture&quot;. Hill performed at the &quot;Reggae Sunsplash&quot; festival in 1985 and in 1986 the original line-up reformed to record two highly regarded albums – &quot;Culture in Culture&quot; and &quot;Culture at Work&quot;.

Several albums followed in the 1990s on Shanachie Records and Ras Records, often recorded with Sly and Robbie, with Dayes leaving the group again around 1994, with Reginald Taylor replacing him. Dayes subsequently worked as a solo artist under the name Kenneth Culture.

By 2001 Telford Nelson had replaced Taylor.

Joseph Hill, who came to symbolise the face of Culture, died in Berlin, Germany on 19 August 2006 while the group was on tour, after collapsing following a performance. His son, Kenyatta Hill, who had acted as the group&#x27;s sound engineer on tour, performed with his father&#x27;s band at the Western Consciousness show in 2007, which was dedicated to Joseph Hill, and became the lead singer of Culture; Walker and Nelson continue to provide backing vocals.

In 2011, &quot;Live On&quot; was released, featuring Kenyatta&#x27;s performances of his father&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot; and &quot;International Herb&quot;.

<doc id="222633" wikidata="Q976308" url="?curid=222633" title="VxD">
<text>VxD is the device driver model used in Microsoft Windows/386 2.x, the 386 enhanced mode of Windows 3.x, Windows 9x, and to some extent also by the Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, and DR-DOS 7.02 (and higher) multitasker (codice_1). VxDs have access to the memory of the kernel and all running processes, as well as raw access to the hardware. Starting with Windows 98, Windows Driver Model was the recommended driver model to write drivers for, with the VxD driver model still being supported for backward compatibility, until Windows Me.

== Name and design ==
The name &quot;VxD&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;virtual xxx driver&quot;, where &quot;xxx&quot; is some class of hardware device. It derives from the fact that most drivers had filenames of the form codice_2 in Windows 3.x. Some examples are vjoyd.386 (joystick) and vmm.386 (memory manager). VxDs under Windows 3.x usually have the filename extension codice_3, while those under Windows 9x have codice_4. VxDs written for Windows 3.x can be used under Windows 9x but not vice versa.

== History ==
Prior to the advent of Windows, DOS applications would either communicate directly with the various pieces of hardware (responding to interrupts, reading and writing device memory etc.) or go through a DOS device driver. As DOS was not multitasking, each application would have exclusive and complete control over the hardware while running. Though Windows applications don&#x27;t often communicate directly with hardware, it was the only way for Windows drivers; and still is in the real and standard modes of Windows 3.x.

Windows/386 and onward allowed multiple DOS applications to execute concurrently by executing each within its own virtual machine. To share physical resources among these virtual machines, Microsoft introduced virtual device drivers. These drivers solved issues relating to conflicting usage of physical resources by intercepting calls to the hardware. Instead of a machine port representing an actual device, it would represent a &quot;virtual&quot; device, which could be managed by the operating system.

Under Windows 9x, the VxD is a Linear Executable format file.

== Obsolescence ==
Although Windows 98 introduced the Windows Driver Model (WDM), VxD device drivers can be used under Windows 98 and Windows Me. Using VxD drivers instead of WDM drivers in Windows 9x may result in advanced ACPI states like hibernation being unavailable.

VxDs are not usable in Windows NT or its descendants. Windows NT-based operating systems from 3.1 to 4.0 must use drivers written specifically for them. These drivers are otherwise known as the Windows NT Driver Model. Starting with Windows 2000, Windows NT-based operating systems have adopted the Windows Driver Model from Windows 98.

VxDs should not be confused with the similarly named NTVDM-specific &#x27;VDDs&#x27; (Virtual Device Drivers), which provide a method of emulating direct I/O under a Windows NT &quot;DOS Box&quot;. NTVDM VDDs run as regular, 32-bit, user-mode DLLs, and must rely on the Win32 API (or another WDM driver) to emulate the desired I/O on behalf of the 16-bit program.

<doc id="222638" wikidata="Q7843483" url="?curid=222638" title="Triple Unite (English coin)">
<text>The Triple [[Unite (English coin)|Unite]], valued at sixty shillings, 60/- or three pounds, was the highest English denomination to be produced in the era of the hammered coinage. It was only produced during the English Civil War, at King Charles I&#x27;s mints at Oxford (between 1642 and 1644) and, rarely, at Shrewsbury in 1642. It weighed 421 grains (27.3 grams, or just over seven-eighths of a troy ounce).

The gold coins show the king holding a sword and an olive branch on the obverse, signifying his wish for peace rather than war.

The extremely rare Shrewsbury-produced coin shows, on the obverse, a plume behind the kings&#x27; head surrounded by the legend – &quot;Charles by the grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland&quot;. The reverse shows the legend in three lines – &quot;The religion of the Protestants, the laws of England and the liberty of Parliament&quot;, with three plumes and the value numeral III above the declaration and the year 1642 below it, the whole being surrounded by the legend (&quot;Let God arise and His enemies be scattered&quot;, from Psalm 68).

The Oxford issues are very similar to the Shrewsbury one, except that the legend on the reverse appears in three lines rather than two, and the obverse legend appears as . Oxford coins appear with slight design differences in each year of 1642, 1643, and 1644.

<doc id="222639" wikidata="Q739924" url="?curid=222639" title="Superunknown">
<text>Superunknown is the fourth studio album by American rock band Soundgarden, released on March 8, 1994, through A&amp;M Records. Produced by Michael Beinhorn and the band themselves, Soundgarden began work on the album after touring in support of their previous album, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; (1991). &quot;Superunknown&quot; retained the heaviness of the band&#x27;s earlier releases while displaying a more diverse range of influences.

&quot;Superunknown&quot; was a critical and commercial success and became the band&#x27;s breakthrough album. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 310,000 copies in its opening week. The album also topped the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand charts. Five singles were released from the album: &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot;, &quot;My Wave&quot;, &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot;, &quot;Spoonman&quot;, and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, the latter two of which won Grammy Awards and helped Soundgarden reach mainstream popularity. At the 37th Grammy Awards, the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. It has been certified 6x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. &quot;Superunknown&quot; has been listed by several publications as one of the best albums of the 1990s and a quintessential grunge album. In April 2019, it was ranked No. 9 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot; list.

==Recording==
Soundgarden began work on the album about two months after finishing its stint on the 1992 Lollapalooza tour. The individual band members would work on material on their own and then bring in demos to which the other members of the band would contribute. Frontman Chris Cornell said that the band members allowed each other more freedom than on past records. Guitarist Kim Thayil observed that even though the band spent as much time writing and arranging as it had on previous albums, it spent a lot more time working on recording the songs. After two albums with producer Terry Date, the band decided to seek another collaborator. Thayil said, &quot;We just thought we&#x27;d go for a change.&quot; Eventually they settled on producer Michael Beinhorn, who &quot;didn&#x27;t have his own trademark sound which he was trying to tack on to Soundgarden&quot; and had ideas the band approved.

The album&#x27;s recording sessions took place from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington, as according to Cornell &quot;there was never a decent studio in Seattle and now there&#x27;s one with a Neve console, so it seemed obvious to use it&quot;. Bad Animals&#x27; resident engineer Adam Kasper, who went on to produce Soundgarden&#x27;s following albums, assisted Beinhorn on the recording process. Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time. The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song, and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top. Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album. The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds, as well as utilizing techniques such as layering, resulting in an expansive production sound. Cornell said, &quot;Michael Beinhorn was so into sounds. He was so, almost, anal about it, that it took the piss out of us a lot of the time ... By the time you get the sounds that you want to record the song, you&#x27;re sick and tired of playing it.&quot; Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band&#x27;s sound, in what &quot;Billboard&quot; described as &quot;weaning the band from brute force, giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power&quot;. For instance, prior to recording the vocals of &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra.

&quot;Superunknown&quot; lasts for 15 songs clocking on approximately 70 minutes because according to Cornell, &quot;we didn&#x27;t really want to argue over what should be cut&quot;. Soundgarden took a break in the middle of recording to open for Neil Young on a ten-day tour of the United States. The band then brought in Brendan O&#x27;Brien to mix the album, as Beinhorn felt the band needed &quot;a fresh pair of ears&quot;; O&#x27;Brien had come recommended by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard. Thayil called the mixing process &quot;very painless&quot;, and bassist Ben Shepherd said it was &quot;the fastest part of the record&quot;.

Footage of the band recording and mixing the song &quot;Kickstand&quot; was featured in the &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; episode &quot;Sound&quot;.

==Composition==
The songs on &quot;Superunknown&quot; captured the metal influences of the band&#x27;s previous works while showcasing the group&#x27;s newly evolving style. Steve Huey of AllMusic said that the band&#x27;s &quot;earlier punk influences are rarely detectable, replaced by surprisingly effective appropriations of pop and psychedelia.&quot; Cornell labeled the album as more &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;versatile&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous releases. The songs on the album are more experimental and diverse than the band&#x27;s previous recordings, with some songs having a Middle-Eastern or Indian flavor (for example &quot;Half&quot;, sung by Shepherd). Some songs also show a Beatles influence, such as &quot;Head Down&quot; and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;. In a 1994 interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Thayil explained, &quot;We looked deep down inside the very core of our souls and there was a little Ringo sitting there. Oh sure, we like telling people it&#x27;s John Lennon or George Harrison; but when you really look deep inside of Soundgarden, there&#x27;s a little Ringo wanting to get out.&quot; Drummer Matt Cameron said that the experimentation on the album was &quot;just a matter of refinement.&quot; According to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, the album &quot;both redefined and transcended grunge&quot;. Michael Beinhorn stated that to achieve the intensity of &quot;Superunknown&quot;, he sought influence from European electronic music, such as the British Aphex Twin and the Dutch genre of Gabber, described by him as &quot;some of the rawest music made&quot;.

Soundgarden used alternate tunings and odd time signatures on several of the album&#x27;s songs. &quot;Spoonman&quot;, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, &quot;Let Me Drown&quot; and &quot;Kickstand&quot; were performed in drop D tuning while &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; was performed in standard tuning. Some songs used more unorthodox tunings: &quot;Superunknown&quot; and &quot;Fresh Tendrils&quot; are in DGDGBe tuning; &quot;Like Suicide&quot; is performed in a similar DGDGBC tuning; &quot;My Wave&quot; and &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot; are both in an EEBBBe tuning; &quot;Mailman&quot; and &quot;Limo Wreck&quot; employed CGDGBe tuning; &quot;Head Down&quot; and &quot;Half&quot; both utilised CGCGGe tuning; and &quot;4th of July&quot; uses CFCGBe tuning. Soundgarden&#x27;s use of odd time signatures was varied as well; &quot;Fell On Black Days&quot; is in 6/4, &quot;Limo Wreck&quot; is played in 15/8, &quot;My Wave&quot; alternates between 5/4 and 4/4, and &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot; alternates between 7/8 and 4/4 sections. Thayil has said that Soundgarden usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after the band had written it, and said that the use of odd meters was &quot;a total accident&quot;.

Lyrically, the album is quite dark and mysterious, as much of it is often interpreted to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album&#x27;s lyrics, Thayil said that &quot;a lot of &quot;Superunknown&quot; seems to me to be about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicing—like the Druids [put it]: &#x27;Life is good, but death&#x27;s gonna be even better!&quot; Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are &quot;a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to &#x27;leave us alone. Cornell stated that &quot;Let Me Drown&quot; is about &quot;crawling back to the womb to die&quot;, &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; is about realizing &quot;you&#x27;re unhappy in the extreme&quot;, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; is about a &quot;surreal dreamscape&quot;, &quot;Limo Wreck&quot; is a shame-on-decadence&#x27; song&quot;, &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot; is about &quot;trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive&quot;, and &quot;4th of July&quot; is about using LSD. Cornell talked about &quot;Mailman&quot; at a concert saying, &quot;This next one is about killing your boss. It&#x27;s about coming to work early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you&#x27;re going to shoot him in the fucking head.&quot; Conversely, &quot;Like Suicide&quot; was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house. He found the severely injured animal and killed it, hitting it with a brick to end its suffering.

The video clip of the song &quot;Spoonman&quot; is notable for featuring a performance by Artis the Spoonman, a street entertainer in Seattle. The title of the song is credited to bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam. While on the set of the movie &quot;Singles&quot;, Ament produced a list of song titles for the fictional band featured in the movie. Cornell took it as a challenge to write songs for the film using those titles, and &quot;Spoonman&quot; was one of them. An acoustic demo version of the song appears in the movie. Cornell said that the song is about &quot;the paradox of who [Artis] is and what people perceive him as&quot;.

The album&#x27;s cover art (known as the &#x27;Screaming Elf&#x27;) is a distorted photograph of the band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above a black and white upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, &quot;&quot;Superunknown&quot; relates to birth in a way ... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold ... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in.&quot; In a 1994 &quot;Pulse!&quot; magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album&#x27;s title came from his misreading of a video entitled &quot;Superclown&quot;. He added, &quot;I thought it was a cool title. I&#x27;d never heard it before, never saw it before, and it inspired me.&quot; The album also saw a limited release on 12&quot; colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album&#x27;s title &#x27;SUPERUNKNOWN&#x27; is sometimes displayed with the &quot;UNKNOWN&quot; as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as &quot;SUPER∩ИKИOMИ&quot;).

On May 25, 2017, photographer Kevin Westenberg revealed the full photo from the cover for the first time on his Instagram account.

==Release and commercial performance==
&quot;Superunknown&quot; was Soundgarden&#x27;s breakthrough album, earning the band international recognition. Upon its release in March 1994, &quot;Superunknown&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, and eventually closed the year as the 13th best-selling album of 1994, with 2.5 million copies sold. The album has been certified six times platinum by the RIAA in the United States, three times platinum in Canada and Australia, two times platinum in Sweden, platinum in the United Kingdom, and gold in the Netherlands and Italy.

As of 2019 &quot;Superunknown&quot; has sold 3.9 million copies in United States according to Nielsen. The album spawned the EP &quot;Songs from the Superunknown&quot; and the CD-ROM &quot;Alive in the Superunknown&quot;, both released in 1995.

===20th-anniversary reissues===
The 20th-anniversary reissue of &quot;Superunknown&quot; was made available in two deluxe versions. The Deluxe Edition was a 2-CD package featuring the remastered album along with disc two consisting of demos, rehearsals, B-sides and more. The Super Deluxe Edition was a 5-CD package featuring the remastered album, additional demos, rehearsals and B-sides and the fifth disc is the album mixed in Blu-ray Audio 5.1 Surround Sound. The Super Deluxe Edition was packaged in a hardbound book with a lenticular cover, liner notes by David Fricke and newly reimagined album artwork designed by Josh Graham. It also featured never-before-seen band photography by Kevin Westerberg. A 2-LP gatefold of the original 16 vinyl tracks remastered on 200-gram vinyl in a gatefold jacket was also made available. In addition, the &quot;Superunknown&quot; singles and associated b-sides with newly interpreted artwork sleeves by Josh Graham was reissued on Record Store Day, April 19, 2014, as a set of five limited-edition 10-inch vinyl records.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Superunknown&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics. &quot;Q&quot; said, &quot;Soundgarden dealt in unreconstructed heavy rock: a heavy guitar sound, depth-charge drumming ... Yet &quot;Superunknown&quot; also includes more measured moments&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s J. D. Considine was impressed by the record&#x27;s range and, despite criticizing &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and &quot;Half&quot;, he said &quot;at its best, &quot;Superunknown&quot; offers a more harrowing depiction of alienation and despair than anything on &quot;In Utero&quot;&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited the band with trying to transcend conventional heavy metal: &quot;&quot;Superunknown&quot; actually tries to broaden its audience by breaking heavy-metal genre barriers that Soundgarden used to accept.&quot; In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne wrote, &quot;Soundgarden is pumped and primed on &quot;Superunknown&quot;, and they deliver the goods.&quot; He praised it as a &quot;hard-rock milestone – a boiling vat of volcanic power, record-making smarts, and &#x27;90s anomie and anxiety that sets a new standard for anything called metal.&quot; Ann Powers from &quot;Blender&quot; said that &quot;guitarist Thayil helps create the stoner-rock template&quot;, and that it &quot;stands as Soundgarden&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau, who had &quot;mocked&quot; Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;conceptual pretentions for years&quot;, still felt their foredooming, pessimistic lyrics lacked much substance, but said they had improved composing, arranging, and producing on an album that was &quot;easily the best—most galvanizing, kinetic, sensational, &quot;catchy&quot;—Zep rip in history&quot;. In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s obvious that &quot;Superunknown&quot; was consciously styled as a masterwork, and it fulfills every ambition.&quot; It received a nomination in the Best Rock Album category for the 1995 Grammy Awards.

&quot;We were listening to Nirvana and Pearl Jam just like everybody else,&quot; remarked Def Leppard&#x27;s Vivian Campbell, &quot;and especially to Soundgarden – the &quot;Superunknown&quot; record. That was the record that we referenced in terms of the sonics and the mood of it when making &quot;Slang&quot;.&quot;

===Accolades===
The critical acclaim garnered by &quot;Superunknown&quot; has led to its inclusion in many lists of the greatest albums.

==Tour==
The band began touring in January 1994 in Oceania and Japan, areas where the record came out early. The band had never toured these regions before. This round of touring ended in February 1994, and then in March 1994 the band moved on to Europe. The band was to join a 20-date co-headline American tour with Nine Inch Nails in April/May, but had to cancel. As an alternative they did a headlining theater tour on May 27, 1994. The opening acts were Tad and Eleven. In late 1994, after touring in support of &quot;Superunknown&quot;, doctors discovered that Cornell had severely strained his vocal cords. Soundgarden cancelled several more shows to avoid causing any permanent damage. Cornell said, &quot;I think we kinda overdid it! We were playing five or six nights a week and my voice pretty much took a beating. Towards the end of the American tour I felt like I could still kinda sing, but I wasn&#x27;t really giving the band a fair shake. You don&#x27;t buy a ticket to see some guy croak for two hours! That seemed like kind of a rip off.&quot; The band made up the dates later in 1995.

==Outtakes==
Although the album&#x27;s singles featured quite a few B-sides, only &quot;Exit Stonehenge&quot; (from the &quot;Spoonman&quot; single) was sourced from the &quot;Superunknown&quot; recording sessions in 1993. &quot;Cold Bitch&quot; (also from &quot;Spoonman&quot;) was recorded during the &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; recording sessions in 1991, &quot;Kyle Petty, Son of Richard&quot; and &quot;Motorcycle Loop&quot; (both from the &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; single) were recorded by Stuart Hallerman at Avast Studios in Seattle in 1994. &quot;Kyle Petty, Son of Richard&quot; was later featured on the 1996 &quot;Home Alive&quot; compilation. &quot;Tighter &amp; Tighter&quot;, &quot;No Attention&quot;, and &quot;An Unkind&quot;, all of which later appeared on the band&#x27;s 1996 album, &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;, were attempted during the &quot;Superunknown&quot; recording sessions. Cameron said that the band wasn&#x27;t pleased with the recording of &quot;No Attention&quot; that came out of the sessions. An instrumental entitled &quot;Ruff Riff-Raff&quot; and a light-hearted song called &quot;Bing Bing Goes to Church&quot; were recorded at album rehearsals but were presumably not recorded during the &quot;Superunknown&quot; recording sessions. Both were released in 2014 on the 20th anniversary Super Deluxe edition.

<text>Roy MacLaren (born 26 October 1934) is a Canadian politician, diplomat, historian, and author.

Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of British Columbia with a major in History, a master&#x27;s degree from St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, a Master of Divinity degree from the University of Trinity College and an honorary Doctor of Sacred Letters degree from the University of Toronto, another honorary degree from the University of Alabama, and in 1973 attended Harvard University&#x27;s Advanced Management Program. In 2002, he received the Alumni Award of Distinction from the University of British Columbia.

During twelve years with the Canadian foreign service, MacLaren&#x27;s postings included Hanoi, Saigon, Prague and the United Nations in New York and Geneva. He served as the Canadian Chair of the Canada-Europe Round Table and the Canadian Institute for International Affairs. He has also served on the Canadian and British board of directors of Deutsche Bank plus a number of other multi-national corporations. He is also the Honorary Colonel of the 7th Toronto Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery.
His historical book, &quot;Canadians on the Nile, 1882–1898&quot; was published in 1978 and the following year he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Liberal MP for Etobicoke North. In June 1983, MacLaren was appointed by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as Minister of State [Finance]. In June 1984, he was appointed to John Turner&#x27;s short-lived cabinet as Minister of National Revenue, but was defeated in the September election by Conservative Bob Pennock. In 1988, he was again elected MP for Etobicoke North. After the Liberals won the 1993 election, he was appointed Minister of International Trade, but resigned that position and his seat in 1996, when he was appointed High Commissioner for Canada in the United Kingdom. He served in that position until 2000.

MacLaren is Chairman of the Canada-India Business Council. He also co-Chairs the Canada Europe Roundtable for Business, sits on the Council of the Champlain Society, the Executive Committee of the Trilateral Commission, the board of directors of the Royal Ontario Museum Foundation Board, is President of St Catharine&#x27;s College Society, and a director of The Council for Business and the Arts in Canada. His published writings reflect his personal and professional experience, much of it concentrating on Canada&#x27;s international history.

While serving as High Commissioner in London, he published the historically significant diaries of explorer William Stairs. The depiction on the book cover of the expedition up Mt. Ruwenzori is based on a sketch by William Stairs now in the National Archives of Canada.

<doc id="222651" wikidata="Q39109" url="?curid=222651" title="Minas Gerais">
<text>Minas Gerais () is one of the 27 federative units of Brazil, being the fourth largest state by area and the second largest in number of inhabitants with a population of 20,539,989 according to the 2022 census. Located in the Southeast Region of the country, it is bordered to south and southwest by São Paulo; Mato Grosso do Sul to the west; Goiás and the Federal District to the northwest; Bahia to the north and northeast; Espírito Santo to the east; and Rio de Janeiro to the southeast. The state&#x27;s capital and largest city, Belo Horizonte, is a major urban and finance center in Brazil, being the sixth most populous municipality in the country while its metropolitan area ranks as the third largest in Brazil with just over 5.8 million inhabitants, after those of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Minas Gerais&#x27; territory is subdivided into 853 municipalities, the largest number among Brazilian states.

The state&#x27;s terrain is quite rugged and some of Brazil&#x27;s highest peaks are located in its territory. It is also home to the source of some of Brazil&#x27;s main rivers, such as the São Francisco and Grande rivers, which places it in a strategic position with regard to the country&#x27;s water resources. It has a tropical climate, which varies from colder and humid in the south to semi-arid in its northern portion. All of these combined factors provide it with a rich fauna and flora distributed in the biomes that cover the state, especially the Cerrado and the threatened Atlantic Forest.

Minas Gerais&#x27; territory was inhabited by indigenous peoples when the Portuguese arrived in Brazil. It experienced a large migration wave following the discovery of gold in the late 17th century. The mining of gold brought wealth and development to the then captaincy, providing its economic and cultural development; however, gold soon became scarce, causing the emigration of a large part of the population until a new cycle (that of coffee) once again brought Minas Gerais national prominence and whose end led to the relatively late industrialization process. Minas Gerais currently has the third largest GDP among Brazilian states, with a large part of it still being the product of mining activities. The state also has a notable infrastructure, with a large number of hydroelectric plants and the largest road network in the country.

Due to its natural beauty and historical heritage, Minas Gerais is an important tourist destination. It is known for its heritage of colonial architecture and art in historical cities such as Ouro Preto and Diamantina, São João del-Rei, Mariana, Tiradentes, Congonhas, Sabará and Serro. In the south, its tourist points are hydro-mineral spas, such as the municipalities of Caxambu, Lambari, São Lourenço, Poços de Caldas, São Thomé das Letras, Monte Verde (a district of Camanducaia) and the national parks of Caparaó and Canastra. In the Serra do Cipó, Sete Lagoas, Cordisburgo and Lagoa Santa, the caves and waterfalls are the main attractions. The people of Minas Gerais also have a peculiar culture, marked by traditional religious festivals and typical countryside cuisine, in addition to national importance in contemporary artistic productions and also in the sports scene.

==Etymology==

Two interpretations are given for the origin of the name Minas Gerais.

The first interpretation is that the name simply means &quot;General Mines&quot;, referring to a number of mines which were located in several spots spread around a larger region.

The second interpretation derives the name from
the former name of the colonial province, &quot;Minas dos Matos Gerais&quot; (&quot;Mines of the General Woods&quot;), referring to two distinct regions encompassed by the state: the region of the mines (Minas), and the &quot;general&quot; region (&quot;Matos Gerais&quot; or &quot;Campos Gerais&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;General Fields&quot;). The latter corresponded to the areas of &quot;sertão&quot; which were farther and hard to access (with an economy based on farming and agriculture) from the mining spots, whose economic space was urban in origin.

==History==
Part of the history of the current state of Minas Gerais was determined by the exploration of the great mineral wealth found in its territory. Its name, in fact, comes from the large quantity and variety of mines present, which began to be explored since the 17th century and to this day drive an important fraction of the state&#x27;s economy.

=== Prehistory and indigenous peoples ===


In the mid-19th century, Danish paleontologist Peter Wilhelm Lund discovered, in the Lagoa Santa region, human remains belonging to a population that lived there thousands of years ago, nicknamed the &quot;Lagoa Santa People&quot;. The region of Minas Gerais was inhabited by indigenous peoples as long as 11,400 to 12,000 years ago, based on the estimated age of the Luzia woman, the name of the oldest human fossil found in the Americas. Luzia was found in 1974 in excavations in Lapa Vermelha, a cave between the municipalities of Lagoa Santa and Pedro Leopoldo, in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte.

Based on the analysis of Luzia and her people&#x27;s cranial morphology, it was theorized that they had Australoid features, having belonged to a population that arrived in the Americas before the ancestors of Amerindians. However, with the analysis of the genetic material of the human remains of the Lagoa Santa People, it was found that this prehistoric population had completely Amerindian DNA, therefore ruling out any relationship with Australasian populations and the theory that the peopling of the Americas was due to a wave of individuals with Australoid traits and another of Mongoloid individuals. The indigenous peoples of Minas Gerais, as well as throughout Brazil and South America, are descendants of the groups who migrated there through North America.

In the region of the municipalities of Januária, Montalvânia, Itacarambi and Juvenília, in northern Minas Gerais, archaeological excavations have led to estimates that the initial settlement occurred at Luzia&#x27;s time. Starting in this period, cultural characteristics emerged, such as the use of stone or bone, the creation of cemeteries and small grain silos, as well as cave paintings. Later, about four thousand years ago, it is speculated that vegetable cultivation occurred, in particular corn, and that two thousand years ago, ceramic products were already being manufactured.

More than a hundred indigenous groups inhabited the current territory of Minas Gerais at the time of the arrival of the Portuguese. In the valleys of the Doce, Jequitinhonha and Mucuri rivers, people generally known as &quot;botocudos&quot; lived, such as the Maxakalis, Maconis, Naquenuques, Aranãs, Krenaks and Pataxós. Northern Minas Gerais was dominated by the Kiriris and Xakriabás. Center, western and southern Minas Gerais were inhabited by the Cataguás, who were the most numerous indigenous group in Minas Gerais&#x27; territory in colonial times, so much so that the region was known as &quot;Campos Gerais dos Cataguases&quot; in the time of the bandeirantes. The regions of Triângulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaíba were inhabited by the Kayapos and Araxás, while the Zona da Mata was populated by the Puri. The region of Minas Gerais close to the border with São Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul and Goiás was occupied by the Bororós.

However, during the first centuries of the colonization of Brazil, the indigenous people of this region were captured by the bandeirantes to be enslaved and the groups that revolted were exterminated, which caused a great reduction in the indigenous population, leaving currently only five groups: the Xakriabás, Krenaks, Maxakalis, Pataxós and Pankararus, the latter coming from Pernambuco&#x27;s hinterlands.

=== Colonial era ===
==== Initial settlement and gold rush ====


The first European expedition into Minas Gerais&#x27; territory was led by Spaniards Francisco Bruza Espinosa and Juan de Azpilcueta Navarro between 1553 and 1555, which left the coast of Bahia and traveled through northern Minas Gerais. In the following decades, other expeditions known as &quot;entries&quot;, coming from the Brazil&#x27;s northeastern coast, traveled through this same region, such as that of Sebastião Fernandes Tourinho in 1573. From the end of the 16th century, &quot;bandeirantes&quot; traveled the territory of Minas Gerais in search of gold and precious stones. Many of their expeditions were supported by the Portuguese Crown, among which those of Fernão Dias and his son-in-law Borba Gato, who left the village of São Paulo in 1674, stand out. In the 17th century, the colonization of northern Minas Gerais began, with the settlement of cattle herders, due to the expansion of livestock farming in the northeastern Sertão, and of &quot;bandeirantes&quot;, in search of precious stones and indigenous people to enslave.

Between 1692 and 1693, the &quot;bandeirante&quot; Antônio Rodrigues Arzão discovered the first gold deposits in the territory of Minas Gerais. In the following years, &quot;bandeirantes&quot; from the towns of São Paulo and Taubaté traveled through the Das Velhas region looking for gold. In 1696, Salvador Fernandes Furtado discovered gold on the banks of the Carmo river and built his camp there, which gave rise to the town of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (now Mariana). Two years later, Antônio Dias de Oliveira discovered gold at the foot of the Itacolomi Peak and founded his settlement there, the embryo of Vila Rica (currently Ouro Preto). In 1702, João de Siqueira Afonso discovered precious stones in the Rio das Mortes valley. Initially, gold was extracted from riverbeds, which forced miners to move as the deposits ran out. After some time, exploration also began to be carried out on mountain slopes, which forced the permanent settlement of miners, leading to the emergence of the first settlements.

The news of the discovery of gold soon spread, initiating a gold rush, and in the following decades hundreds of thousands of people eager for wealth, mainly Portuguese (which included New Christians), but also colonial Brazilians from São Paulo, Bahia, Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro, settled in Minas Gerais. The arrival of large numbers of people in a short time led to epidemics and food shortages. In 1697, the Portuguese used enslaved African labor to start building the Estrada Real, the &quot;royal road,&quot; that would connect the ports of cities of Rio de Janeiro and Paraty to the mineral-rich regions of Vila Rica, Serro, and, at the northernmost point, Diamantina.

São Paulo settlers considered themselves owners of the gold taken from the mines, claiming the right due to having discovered and conquered it, and did not want others to take possession of the mines. As a result, in 1707, they came into conflict with the Portuguese and other Brazilian settlers (nicknamed &quot;emboabas&quot;, a Tupi term that means &quot;one who offends&quot;), causing the War of the Emboabas, which ended in 1709. The São Paulo settlers were defeated and many of them had to abandon the gold deposits in Minas Gerais, having to look for the metal in what is now the Central-West region of Brazil, finding it years later in Goiás and Mato Grosso.

Prior to 1720, Minas Gerais was part of the captaincy of São Vicente. The imposition of the authority of the Portuguese Crown contributed to the end of the conflict, with the creation of the Captaincy of São Paulo and Minas do Ouro in 1709. In 1711, the first villages were created in Minas Gerais, namely Sabará, Vila Rica and Vila de Nossa Senhora do Carmo. In 1720, the Vila Rica Revolt took place against taxes on gold and, as a result, that same year the Captaincy of Minas Gerais was created after the dismemberment of São Paulo e Minas do Ouro. The first capital of Minas Gerais, and seat of the local see, was the city of Mariana; it was later moved to Vila Rica. In the late 18th century, Vila Rica was the largest city in Brazil and one of the most populous in the Americas.

The Portuguese Crown then began to strictly control the mining of gold, instating a 20% tax of everything that was produced, which became known as &quot;the fifth&quot;. The captaincy&#x27;s population continued to grow, but until then there were only small subsistence agricultural crops, which required the import of products from other regions of the colony. New access ways to the region began to be created and the flow of people and goods increased intensely, thus creating the first large consumer market in Brazil. Villages appeared along these access points, therefore playing a key role in the population of the captaincy. Among these routes, the &quot;Caminho Novo&quot; stands out, which connected the mining regions to Rio de Janeiro. The intense mix of people associated with wealth from gold and urban life led to the formation of a new, culturally diverse society, with several musicians, artists, sculptors and artisans. Among the cultural movements, the work of Aleijadinho and Master Ataíde stands out, among others, which allowed the flourishing of a local Baroque. Aleijadinho&#x27;s sculptural and architectural work, as exhibited in the Twelve Prophets and The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi in Ouro Preto, are prime examples of this period.

In addition to art and architecture, there was an explosion of musical activity in Minas Gerais in the 18th century. Printed copies of European music, as well as accomplished musicians, made the journey to the area, and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication. Several composers worked in Minas Gerais in the 18th century, mainly in Vila Rica, Sabará, Mariana, and other cities. Some of the names which have survived include José Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita, Marcos Coelho Neto, Francisco Gomes da Rocha and Ignácio Parreiras Neves; they cultivated a style related to the classical European style, but marked by more a more chordal, homophonic sound, and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments.

In the 1720s, in the Jequitinhonha valley region, the discovery of diamonds occurred, although its discoverers did not recognize the value of this precious stone for decades. However, the Portuguese Crown, upon recognizing the region&#x27;s mineral production, soon established a way of charging taxes in a similar way to the gold tax. The main diamond exploration center was close to where Arraial do Tijuco (today Diamantina) emerged.

At the height of gold mining, enslaved labor was essential for large landowners. In this way, the trade in slaves brought from the African continent to work in the mines intensified. Many slaves tried and managed to escape, which led to the emergence of &quot;quilombos&quot; throughout Minas Gerais. It is estimated that during the 18th century more than 120 of these communities emerged throughout the captaincy. These settlements were not so far from mining centers, which made it easier for more slaves to escape. There was also a trade in subsistence products between slaves and traders, who took advantage of the lower price offered by the former. In 1753, Rosa Egipcíaca, was enslaved and forced to work as a prostitute in a mine in the region, until she became ill and began to have religious visions. These visions led to her arrest and imprisonment and ultimately interrogation by the Inquisition. She recorded them in the first book to be written by a black woman in Brazil — &quot;Sagrada Teologia do Amor Divino das Almas Peregrinas&quot;.

==== Minas Gerais&#x27; conspiracy ====

During the 18th century, mining exploration was strongly controlled by the Portuguese Crown, which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted (one fifth of all gold would go to the Crown). Several rebellions were attempted by the colonists, always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown. One of the most important was the Vila Rica revolt that ended with the execution of Filipe dos Santos, the revolt&#x27;s leader, but also with the separation of Minas Gerais from the captaincy São Paulo e Minas de Ouro. The most notable one, however, was the Minas Gerais conspiracy, started in 1789 by a group of middle-class colonists, mostly intellectuals and young officers. They were inspired by the American and French Enlightenment ideals. The conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled. The most famous of them, Joaquim José da Silva Xavier (known as Tiradentes), was hanged by order of Queen Maria I of Portugal, becoming a local hero and a national martyr of Brazil. The Minas Gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background, along with the Latin motto &quot;Libertas quæ sera tamen&quot;, &quot;freedom albeit late&quot;—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the &quot;Inconfidentes&quot;, as the rebels became known.

In the economic history of Brazil, Minas Gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the Brazilian northeast (based on sugarcane, that starts declining in the 18th century) to the southeast of the country, which still remains the major economic center. The large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of Portugal back to Brazil, progressively turning Rio de Janeiro into an important port city, from where these would be shipped to Portugal and where the Portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in 1808 after Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s invasion of Portugal (see Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil).

Due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—Minas Gerais has also played an important role on national politics. During the 19th century, politicians such as José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva were instrumental in the establishment of the Brazilian Empire under the rule of Pedro I and later his son, Pedro II. After the installation of the First Brazilian Republic, during the early 20th century, Minas Gerais shared the control of the national political scene with São Paulo in what became known as the &quot;coffee with milk politics&quot; (coffee being the major product of São Paulo, and milk representing Minas Gerais&#x27; dairy industry, despite the latter also being an important coffee producer).

Minas Gerais was also home to two of the most influential Brazilian politicians of the second half of the 20th century. Juscelino Kubitschek was president from 1956 to 1961, and he was responsible for the construction of Brasília as the new capital of Brazil. Tancredo Neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in 1984 to be the first civil president after the 1964 military coup. However, he died after a series of health complications just as he was about to assume the position. Also, Itamar Franco, former president of Brazil, lived there, though he was not born in Minas Gerais.

==Geography==
Minas Gerais features some of the longest rivers in Brazil, most notably the São Francisco, the Paraná and to a lesser extent, the Doce river. The state also holds many hydroelectric power plants, including Furnas. Some of the highest peaks in Brazil are in the mountain ranges in the southern part of the state, such as the Mantiqueira Mountains and Serra do Cervo, that mark the border between Minas and its neighbors São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The most notable one is the Bandeira peak, the third highest mountain in Brazil at 2,890 m, standing on the border with Espírito Santo state. The state also has huge reserves of iron and sizeable reserves of gold and gemstones, including emerald, topaz and aquamarine mines. Emeralds found in this location are comparable to the best Colombia-origin emeralds, and are most often a bluish-green color.

Each region of the state has a distinct character, geographically and to a certain extent culturally.

* The central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky, with little vegetation on the mountains. Around Lagoa Santa and Sete Lagoas a typical Karst topography with caves and lakes is found. Some of the mountains are almost entirely iron ore, which led to extensive mining. About to the east of Belo Horizonte is the second Metropolitan Region of the state, Vale do Aço (&quot;Steel Valley&quot;), which has iron and steel processing companies along the course of the Doce river and its tributaries. Vale do Aço&#x27;s largest cities are Ipatinga, Coronel Fabriciano and Timóteo. The city of Governador Valadares is in the limit of this region with the North.
* The south of Minas Gerais is hilly and green, with coffee and milk production. This region is notably colder than the rest of the state, and some locations are subject to temperatures just below the freezing point during the winter. The region is also famed for its mineral-water resorts, including the cities of Poços de Caldas, Lambari, São Lourenço and Caxambu. Many industries are located at Varginha and Pouso Alegre.
* The southeast of the state, called Zona da Mata, was the richest region until the mid 20th century, nowadays the biggest city, Juiz de Fora, remains an important industrial, cultural and educational center, being also the fourth largest in Minas Gerais. The day-to-day living in the Zona da Mata however, is better represented by a group of smaller cities like Manhuaçu, Além Paraíba, Viçosa, Leopoldina, Cataguases, Muriaé, Ubá, Astolfo Dutra and several others. Those cities put together form a strong economic presence based mostly on agriculture, textiles and minerals. The city of the principal coffee region in Minas Gerais is São João do Manhuaçu situated in Zona da Mata.
* The west of Minas Gerais, also known as &quot;Triângulo Mineiro&quot; (which means &quot;the Minas Triangle&quot;, due to the geographic shape of this region), is composed of a particular type of savanna, known as the &quot;cerrado&quot;. This region was initially occupied by large free-wheeling beef ranches, which are still important for the economy of the region. Over the 1990s, extensive soy and corn farms occupied much of the farming land available. The cerrado is also one of the principal coffee-growing areas of Brazil. The main cities of this region are Uberlândia, Uberaba, Patos de Minas and Araguari.
* The north of Minas Gerais is part of the arid &quot;sertão&quot; of the northeast region, and is thus subject to frequent droughts. Recent irrigation projects use the water from the São Francisco River for agriculture; the river crosses the northern region carrying water from its basin in the central area of the state, which is subject to a regular rainfall pattern. The diamond mines of this region, mainly in Diamantina, attracted miners but are now exhausted, and the remaining population lives in poor conditions, especially in the valley of the Jequitinhonha River. The region is, however, known for its high quality cachaça production. Salinas in particular exports large amounts of this alcoholic beverage. The main cities of this region are Montes Claros, Teófilo Otoni, Pirapora and Janaúba.

===Paleontology===

The discovery of the &quot;Maxakalisaurus topai&quot; (Dinoprata) fossils was a significant paleontological find. The fossil is a genus of titanosaurid dinosaur found 45 kilometers (28 mi) from the city of Prata, in the state of Minas Gerais in 1998. It was closely related to &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;, a sauropod considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits, including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine; such osteoderms have also been found for Maxakalisaurus. The genus name is derived from the tribe of the Maxakali.

The &quot;Maxakalisaurus&quot; fossils belonged to an animal about 13 meters (43.3 ft) long, with an estimated weight of 9 tons, although, according to paleontologist Alexander Kellner, it could reach a length of approximately 20 meters (65 ft). It had a long neck and tail, ridged teeth (unusual among sauropods) and lived about 80 million years ago. Because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in South America, they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world. A replica has been displayed at the National Museum of Brazil, since August 28, 2006.

In the 1940s, fossil records from the Late Cretaceous period began to be unearthed in the territory of Uberaba, many of them exceptionally well-preserved. Subsequently, extensive research efforts were initiated by the National Department of Mineral Production (DNPM), which appointed paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Price to work in the region. Due to the large quantity of fossils uncovered, the Paleontological Research Center Llewellyn Ivor Price was established in 1991, alongside the Dinosaurs Museum in Peirópolis, which is currently dedicated to the study of local paleontology in collaboration with research institutions worldwide.

In March 2024, Uberaba was officially designated as a UNESCO Global Geopark, marking it as the first of its kind in Minas Gerais. The territory is situated within the Serra da Galga Formation, where more than 10,000 fossils of various prehistoric creatures have been unearthed. Among these discoveries, the &quot;Uberabatitan ribeiroi&quot; found in 2004 ranks among the largest ever discovered in Latin America.

==Demographics==

According to the 2022 census, there were 20,539,989 people residing in the state. The population density was . Urbanization: 85% (2006); Population growth: 1.4% (1991–2000); Houses: 5,741,000 (2006).

The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 9,605,151 Brown (Multiracial) people (46.8%), 8,437,697 White people (41.1%), 2,432,877 Black people (11.8%), 31,885 Amerindian people (0.2%), 31,681 Asian people (0.2%).
Ethnic groups found in Minas Gerais include: Amerindians, Portuguese, Africans, Italians, Germans and Lebanese.

The ethnic composition of the population varies from town to town. For example, in Córrego do Bom Jesus, a small town located in the extreme south of Minas Gerais, White people make up 98.7% of the population. The South of Minas Gerais is both the most European and the most densely populated part of the state. On the other hand, in Setubinha, located in the northeast part of the state, 71.8% are mixed-race and 14.7% Black. It is historically explainable: southern Minas Gerais, in the border with São Paulo, received larger numbers of Portuguese farmers in colonial times. In the late 19th century, Italian immigrants also arrived. The north region, close to Bahia, was a place to the arrival of many African slaves since the 18th century. The central part of the state, where the capital Belo Horizonte is, has a more balanced ratio between White, Black and mixed people.


The population of Minas Gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples, particularly between Black Africans and Portuguese. In colonial Minas Gerais, the population was divided in five different categories: &quot;Whites&quot;, mostly Portuguese; &quot;Africans&quot;, who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin (for example &quot;Francisca Benguela&quot; would refer to Benguela); &quot;Crioulos&quot; (Black people born in Brazil, usually to both African parents); Mulattoes (people of mixed Black and White ancestry, usually born to a Black mother and a Portuguese father) and &quot;Cabras&quot; (people of mixed ancestry, usually with high degree of Amerindian admixture). Black people and &quot;Mulattoes&quot; predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization. By the 19th century, however, whites were already the largest single group in the Minas Gerais population. Taking the population as a whole (all groups included), European genes account for the majority of the Minas Gerais genetic heritage, which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved African population and lower reproductive rate of African slaves (the vast majority of them were males, among other reasons for their lower reproductive success). The Amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the European colonists and they did not have much of an impact either, especially in Minas Gerais, where European presence and colonization was massive.

During the colonial period, the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp. The census of 1738 in Serro do Frio, which included Diamantina, revealed that of the 9,681 inhabitants, 83.5% were men and 16.5% women. Among the slaves, women were only 3.1%. The number of free &quot;women of color&quot; (Black and &quot;Mulatto&quot;) was very high. The same census revealed that 63% of the former slaves were women and only 37% men. Since interracial relationships between &quot;women of color&quot; and White men were widespread, the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves.

The monogamous family structure that the Catholic Church tried to deploy in colonial Brazil was the exception in Minas Gerais. At that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in Minas Gerais, as well as in Brazil as a whole. Monogamy and weddings in churches would only take root in Brazil in the 19th century, fitting the moral standards imposed by the Church. The role of women in colonial Minas Gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time. Many women used to live on their own, were heads of family and worked, particularly the &quot;women of color&quot; and former slaves. The society of Minas Gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves, mainly for women. In Tejuco, the percentage of White males who were head of family (37.7%) was very similar to the percentage of Black women who were head of family (38.5%). Many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well. Some Black people and mainly Mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of Minas Gerais, once restricted to Whites. This happened through a process of &quot;whitening&quot; their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the White elite, like being members of Catholic brotherhoods.

Cohabitation was the most common crime in Minas Gerais. The Catholic Church was strict in the punishment of this crime, in order to prevent the widespread miscegenation between White, mostly Portuguese males with Black or Mulatto women.

According to a 2013 autosomal DNA study, the ancestral composition of the state of Minas Gerais can be described as: 59.20% European, 28.90% African and 11.90% Native American 

During the time of the gold rush, thousands of Portuguese immigrated to Brazil (mainly from the Minho), and many of them to Minas Gerais, the place where the gold rush activities took place. Most of them came from Entre Douro e Minho, in Northern Portugal. The reference book for a large number of these families is &quot;Velhos Troncos Mineiros&quot; (Old Mineiro Branches) by Raimundo Trindade. The Native American population of Minas Gerais was estimated to be at 97,000 in 1500, by the time the Portuguese arrived in Brazil in 1500 (John Hemming in &quot;Red Gold: The Conquest of the Brazilian Indians&quot;).

The ancestry of the Africans brought to Minas Gerais was both West African and Bantu, with a predominance of the former initially and a predominance of the latter later.

=== Major cities ===
===Religion===
According to the 2010 Brazilian census, most of the population consider themselves to be Catholic, which puts the state in ninth place when considering the percentage of the population belonging to this religion (70.4%). Although the number of Catholics has been gradually decreasing in recent years, Roman Catholicism is still strongly rooted in Minas Gerais&#x27; culture, especially in rural areas and inland cities where celebrations and festivities organized by community parishes are common, but religious pluralism has also grown in recent years.

Almost four million inhabitants are evangelical. According to the number of followers, the Assembleias de Deus (more than seven hundred thousand followers), the Baptist Church (more than five hundred thousand followers) and the Foursquare Church (almost three hundred and fifty thousand adherents) stand out. Around 420 thousand people in the state are followers of Spiritism, whose important promoter in Brazil was the Minas Gerais-born medium Chico Xavier. There are also several other religious minorities in the state, including Umbanda and Candomblé, which together have less than twenty thousand followers and whose rituals are sometimes confused with folk traditions. Almost a million people, in turn, consider themselves irreligious, of which around seventy thousand are atheists and just over seven thousand are agnostics.

==Economy==
Minas Gerais is the second-largest consumer market in Brazil, behind the state of São Paulo. It shares 10.4% of the Brazilian consumer market. Companies of this Brazilian state have access to 49% of the Brazilian consumer market, with estimated consumption potential of 223 billion US dollars. The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 47.1%, followed by the industrial sector at 44.1%. agriculture represents 8.8% of GDP (2004). Main exports: mineral products 44.4%, metals 15.8%, vegetable products 13%, precious metals 5.5%, foodstuffs 4.9%, transportation 3.5% (2012).

Its share of the Brazilian economy in 2005 was 9%. 
Minas Gerais had an industrial GDP of R $128.4 billion in 2017, equivalent to 10.7% of the national industry. It employs 1,069,469 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: construction (17.9%), extraction of metallic minerals (15.2%), food (13.4%), industrial services of public utility, such as electricity and water (10.8%) and metallurgy (10.5%). These 5 sectors concentrate 67.8% of the state&#x27;s industry.

Minas Gerais is a major producer of milk, coffee and other agricultural commodities, as well as minerals. The state has marked economic divisions. The southern part of the state (close to the São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro state borders) has several mid-sized cities with solid industrial bases such as Juiz de Fora, Varginha, Pouso Alegre, and Poços de Caldas, as well as Ipatinga in the east of the state, which is also a modern and major industrial city and Itabira, considered mother city of mining company Vale, that has stocks quoted in Bovespa and NYSE. The northeastern region is marked by poverty, but Governador Valadares and Teófilo Otoni attract foreign traders for the semi-precious gems such as topaz and sapphire. In Teófilo Otoni, some companies are also attracted because of Brazilian Export Processing Zone, a free trade area.

===Agriculture===


The western part, the &quot;Triângulo Mineiro&quot;, is less densely populated than the rest of the state, and it is now a focus of biotechnology investment, particularly on the cities of Uberlândia, Uberaba, Patos de Minas and Araguari, which includes leading research on cattle, soy and corn culture.

In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of coffee, sugar cane and soy, and also has large productions of orange, beans, sorghum, carrot, potato, banana, tangerine and strawberry, in addition to producing papaya, persimmon and cassava.

In 2020, Minas Gerais was the largest producer of Coffea arabica in the country, with 74% of the national total (1.9 million tons, or 31.2 million 60-kg bags). In 2017, Minas represented 54.3% of the total national production of coffee (first place).

The state was the third largest producer of sugar cane in Brazil in 2020, representing 11.1% of the total produced in the country, with 74.3 million tons.

The cultivation of soy, on the other hand, is increasing, however, it is not among the largest national producers of this grain. In the 2018–2019 harvest, Minas Gerais harvested 5 million tons (seventh place in the country). The state was the second largest producer of oranges in 2018, with a total of 948 thousand tons.

Minas Gerais is the second largest producer of beans in Brazil, with 17.2% of national production in 2020. In addition, it is one of the largest national producers of sorghum: around 30% of Brazilian production. It also ranks third in domestic production of cotton.

The state was the third largest producer of banana in 2018, with 766 thousand tons. Brazil was already the 2nd largest producer of the fruit in the world, currently in 3rd place, losing only to India and Ecuador.

In 2018, São Paulo and Minas Gerais were the largest producers of tangerine in Brazil. Minas was the 5th largest producer of papaya. About persimmon, Minas ranks third with 8%.

In 2019, in Brazil, there was a total production area of around 4 thousand hectares of strawberry. The largest producer is Minas Gerais, with approximately 1,500 hectares, cultivated in most municipalities in the extreme south of the state, in the Serra da Mantiqueira region, with Pouso Alegre and Estiva being the largest producers.

Regarding carrots, Brazil ranked fifth in the world ranking in 2016, with an annual production of around 760 thousand tons. In relation to the exports of this product, Brazil occupies the seventh world position. Minas Gerais is the largest producer in Brazil. Among the production centers in Minas Gerais are the municipalities of São Gotardo, Santa Juliana and Carandaí.

===Mineral extraction===

The central region of the state (where the capital is located) has big reserves of iron (and to a lesser extent, gold) still being actively mined. In mineral production, in 2017, Minas Gerais was the country&#x27;s largest producer of iron (277 million tons worth R$37.2 billion), gold (29.3 tons worth R$3.6 billion), zinc (400 thousand tons worth R$351 million) and niobium (in the form of hydrochloride) (131 thousand tons worth R$254 million). In addition, Minas Gerais was the second largest producer of bauxite (1.47 million tons at a value of R$105 million), the third of manganese (296 thousand tons worth R$32 million) and fifth of tin (206 tons worth R$4.7 million). There are also deposits of verdete slate, a glauconite-bearing mineral. Minas Gerais had 47.19% of the value of the production of minerals marketed in Brazil (first place), with R$41.7 billion.

The state has the largest production of various precious and semi-precious stones in the country. In aquamarine, Minas Gerais produces the most valuable stones in the world. In diamond, Brazil was the largest diamond producer in the world from 1730 to 1870, mining occurred for the first time in the Serra da Canastra, region of Diamantina, even lowering the price of stone in everyone due to overproduction. Minas Gerais continues to mine diamonds, in addition to having larger or smaller scale productions of agate, emerald, garnet, jasper and sapphire. Topaz and tourmaline stand out. In topaz, Brazil has the most valuable variety in the world, imperial topaz, only produced in Ouro Preto. Furthermore, the country is the world&#x27;s leading producer of topaz. It&#x27;s also among the world&#x27;s largest tourmaline producers.

In the steel industry, Brazilian crude steel production was 32.2 million tons in 2019. Minas Gerais represented 32.3% of the volume produced in the period, with 10,408 million tons, being the largest steel center. Among the steel companies in Minas Gerais are Usiminas, ArcelorMittal Aços Longos (formerly Belgo Mineira), Açominas (belonging to Gerdau), Vallourec &amp; Mannesmann and Aperam South America.

===Manufacturing===

There are also large companies installed the automotive industry, as manufacturers FIAT in Betim, IVECO in Sete Lagoas, Mercedes-Benz and suppliers of auto-parts, as STOLA and USIPARTS. In Brazil, the automotive sector represents about 22% of the industrial GDP. Minas Gerais is the third largest vehicle producer in the country, with a 10.7% participation in 2019.

In the electronics industry, the billing of industries in Brazil reached R$153 billion in 2019, around 3% of national GDP. The number of employees in the sector was 234.5 thousand people. Exports were $5.6 billion, and the country&#x27;s imports were $32 billion. Brazil has two large electroelectronic production centers, located in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, in the State of São Paulo, and in the Free Zone of Manaus, in the State of Amazonas. The country also has other smaller centers, one of them in the municipality of Santa Rita do Sapucaí, in Minas Gerais. In Santa Rita do Sapucaí, 8 thousand jobs are linked to the sector, with more than 120 companies. Most of them produce equipment for the telecommunications industry, such as decoders, including those used in the transmission of the digital television system. The company Multilaser has a plant in the city of Extrema.

In the food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world, with a value of US$34.1 billion in exports. The income of the Brazilian food and beverage industry in 2019 was R$699.9 billion, 9.7% of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product. In 2015, the food and beverage industry in Brazil comprised 34,800 companies (not including bakeries), the vast majority of which were small. These companies employed more than 1.6 million workers, making the food and beverage industry the largest employer in the manufacturing industry. There are around 570 large companies in Brazil, which concentrate a good part of the total industry income. Minas Gerais created food companies of national importance such as Itambé and Pif Paf Alimentos.

In the footwear industry, in 2019 Brazil produced 972 million pairs. Exports were around 10%, reaching almost 125 million pairs. Brazil ranks fourth among world producers, behind China, India and Vietnam, and 11th among the largest exporters. Minas Gerais has a polo specialized in cheap shoes and sneakers in Nova Serrana. The city has around 830 industries, which in 2017 produced around 110 million pairs.

In the textile industry, Brazil, despite being among the 5 largest producers in the world in 2013, and being representative in the consumption of textiles and clothing, has little insertion in world trade. In 2015, Brazilian imports ranked 25th (US$5.5 billion). And in exports, it was only 40th in the world ranking. Brazil&#x27;s share of world textile and clothing trade is only 0.3%, due to the difficulty of competing in price with producers from India and mainly from China. The gross value of production, which includes the consumption of intermediate goods and services, of the Brazilian textile industry corresponded to almost R $40 billion in 2015, 1.6% of the gross value of industrial production in Brazil. Minas Gerais has 8.51% (third largest production in the country).

===Service industry===
Tourism is also an important activity for the state: historical cities like Ouro Preto, Mariana, Sabará, Congonhas, Diamantina, Tiradentes, and São João del-Rei, are major attractions for visitors interested in their colonial architecture. Other cities, like Araxá, Poços de Caldas, Lambari, Caxambu, Lavras, and others, attract visitors interested in their mineral watersprings. Eco-tourism is a rising economic activity in the state, especially in localities situated on the several highlands that exist in Minas Gerais.

== Tourism==
One of the most important tourist circuits in Minas Gerais is the Estrada Real, which passes through the old roads used to transport gold from the mines, connecting the central region of the state with the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Parati. The different itineraries of this circuit present historical, cultural and natural attractions for its visitors. Another noteworthy aspect of tourism in Minas Gerais includes visits to historic cities, which preserve colonial museum buildings, in addition to including museums and cultural spaces that reveal the past of these places. Of these cities, Ouro Preto stands out, where the Museum of Inconfidência is located.

The relief of the state, with an abundance of peaks and mountains (especially the great peaks), in addition to the large number of grottos and caves, natural and artificial rivers and lakes, and the richness of the state&#x27;s fauna and flora, attract practitioners of ecotourism and adventure tourism. Another relevant segment is rural tourism, since Minas is one of the states with the most developments for this purpose. In the central region of the state, in addition to the historic cities and the capital, there are national parks such as Serra do Cipó, as well as the Inhotim Museum, which has one of the largest collections of contemporary art in the country. In the south of the state, there is the Circuito das Águas, known for its mineral spas. São Lourenço and Poços de Caldas are cities famous for their spas, hot springs and thermal baths.

It also highlights business tourism, which is booming, since in recent years important events of international projection have been held in the state. In particular, the city of Belo Horizonte stands out in this segment, attracting more and more fairs, congresses and meetings, which can be attributed to the city&#x27;s infrastructure and important hotel network. Other cities in the interior (such as Juiz de Fora, Uberaba and Uberlândia) also offer options for holding large business events.

==Infrastructure==
===Highways===
As of November 2020, the state of Minas Gerais had, in addition to municipal highways, 39,738 km of state and federal highways, of which 29,255 were paved and 2,505 km were duplicate highways. The state has duplicate highways that leave the capital Belo Horizonte and connect it with São Paulo (BR-381) and Rio de Janeiro (BR-040), and in its western part (BR-050, BR-153 and BR-365 in the area known as the Triângulo Mineiro, between the states of São Paulo and Goiás, near Uberaba and Uberlândia). Some parts of BR-262 are also duplicated. The state, however, presents, in general, a duplication deficit, with sections of a single lane with movement above the saturation limit. Recently, in 2022, a project was created to grant BR-381 to private initiative, with the intention of doubling 215 km between Belo Horizonte, Ipatinga and Novo Oriente de Minas.

Minas Gerais is the Brazilian state that harbors the highest mileage of highways. The state highway network is 269,545 kilometers, of which only 11,396 on federal roads and 21,472 on state highways and state coincide, corresponding to all other municipal roads. Because of its central position, the state is crossed by the most important national highways, like BR-116 (Rio-Bahia), BR-040 (Rio-Brasília) and others. Many of the most important Brazilian routes cross the state and, for this reason, it counts the greater proportion of car accidents per capita.

=== Railways ===
Rail transport has been around since the 19th century, when the Central Railway of Brazil was built in 1860. In 1874, the Leopoldina Railway was inaugurated. In 1880 the Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas was founded and in the following decades several other railways were opened in the territory of Minas Gerais. Starting in the 1960s, railways began to be replaced by roads, due to the growing demand for the car fleet, which resulted in the closure of some railways and branches. In the 1990s, the entire national railway system was privatized, disabling the remaining passenger services on some local lines. However, there are still active railways that cross the Minas Gerais, today used only for freight, such as the old Central do Brasil Railway, Leopoldina Railway, Western Minas Railway and Steel Railway, operated by dealers. Railway Center. Atlantic. Vitória a Minas Railway (EFVM) is responsible for transporting the production of Vale and other state companies to the port of Tubarão, in Vitória, Espírito Santo, and also operates the only daily passenger train in Brazil that runs long distances, between Vitória and Belo Horizonte, which connects other cities that also have stations.

===Airport===
Tancredo Neves International Airport is located in the municipalities of Lagoa Santa and Confins, 38 km (23 mi) from Belo Horizonte, and was opened in January 1984. It was planned from the start for future expansion in steps to meet growing demand. The airport has one of the lowest rates of shutdown for bad weather in the country. However, the Confins airport was not using much of its capacity until 2005, when it was decided that a large part of the Pampulha Airport flights (which is smaller and located inside Belo Horizonte&#x27;s urban area) would move to Confins.

===Administrative center===
A new administrative center (Cidade Administrativa de Minas Gerais) was completed in March 2010, for the state of Minas Gerais. Designed by architect Oscar Niemeyer, the center consists of four large buildings on an 800,000 square meter site. Two buildings accommodate 17 of the state ministries, the third building consists of an auditorium, with capacity for 540 guests. The fourth building is the &quot;Palacio do Governo&quot;, which is the world&#x27;s largest suspended structure, built in reinforced concrete. The building has a 150m span, and its roof is supported by four columns.

=== Education ===
The &quot;education&quot; factor of Minas Gerais&#x27; HDI reached the mark of 0.762 in 2021 — the seventh highest in the country — while the illiteracy rate of people aged 15 and over was 4.8% in 2022, the eleventh best national percentage, but the worst in the Brazilian Southeast. Based on the 2011 Basic Education Development Index (IDEB) report, Minas Gerais obtained the highest rate among students in the 5th year of elementary school among Brazilian states — 5.9 —, the third highest value in the 9th year — 4.6, second only to Santa Catarina and São Paulo — and the fourth highest among 3rd year high school students — 3.9, second to Santa Catarina, Paraná and São Paulo. In the 2013 general classification of the National Secondary Education Examination (ENEM), five schools from Minas Gerais were among the ten best in the national ranking, which also included the only school located in a city outside the capital.

With 11,831 primary education establishments, 7,431 pre-school units and 2,979 secondary schools, the state&#x27;s education network is one of the most extensive in Brazil. According to data from the 2010 census sample, of the total population, 5,681,163 inhabitants attended daycare centers and/or schools. Of this total, 179,819 attended daycare centers, 492,875 were in pre-school education, 325,115 in literacy classes, 74,319 in youth and adult literacy classes, 2,682,189 in primary education, 176,379 in youth and adult primary education, 859,491 in secondary education, 177,395 in youth and adult secondary education, 624,707 in undergraduate higher education courses, 63,263 in higher-level specializations, 17,514 in master&#x27;s degrees and 8,096 in doctorates. 12,080,382 people did not attend school units, with 1,835,785 having never attended and 10,244,597 having attended at some point.

Among the many higher education institutions, the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) stands out, ranked as the 7th best university in Latin America in 2024 and, together with the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV), the Federal University of Triângulo Mineiro (UFTM) and Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), is among the best in Brazil according to the General Course Index, from the Ministry of Education. The Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU) also stands out in the state, it ranked 4th best in Minas Gerais, and 28th in Brazil, ahead of UFLA, UFOP and UFTM, according to data of the ranking of Brazilian universities by &quot;Folha de S. Paulo&quot;, in 2016. Minas Gerais is the state with the largest number of federal higher education institutions in the country, housing 20 institutions, including 8 federal institutes, 1 federal center and 11 federal universities. It also has two state institutions: the State University of Minas Gerais and the State University of Montes Claros. In addition to around 350 private and philanthropic colleges and universities present in more than 240 municipalities.

==Sports==

As in the rest of Brazil, football is the most popular sport among locals. Pelé, widely considered the best footballer of all time, was born in the Minas city of Três Corações. Belo Horizonte is home to two of the most successful teams in the country, and the city also has one of the biggest football stadiums in the world, the Mineirão, opened in 1965. Reopened after renovations in 2013, Mineirão was chosen as one of the venues for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and also the soccer tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics. Another stadium in Belo Horizonte, Independência Stadium, was one of the venues of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, where it hosted a legendary upset of the United States team over England.

The biggest teams of Belo Horizonte and Minas as a whole are Atlético Mineiro, founded in 1908 and nicknamed &quot;Galo&quot; (rooster) after its mascot, and Cruzeiro, founded in 1921 as &quot;Palestra Itália&quot; by the members of the local Italian community. Atlético is the record winner of its state championship, the Campeonato Mineiro with 41 titles, the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A title in the 1971 season, two Copa CONMEBOL titles in 1992 and 1997 (the predecessor of the current Copa Sudamericana), one Copa Libertadores title in 2013 and a Copa do Brasil title in 2014. Cruzeiro have won 36 state championships, won four Campeonato Brasileiro Série A titles, the 1966 Taça Brasil (beating Pelé&#x27;s Santos in the final, a treble in 2003 (after winning the 2003 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A title, the 2003 Copa do Brasil, and the 2003 Campeonato Mineiro title), and most recently won both the 2013 and 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A and Brazilian Cup of 2017 and 2018. Cruzeiro has been one of Brazil&#x27;s most successful clubs since the 1960s, being elected the most successful Brazilian team of the 20th century by IFFHS. Its titles include 6 editions of the Brazilian Cup, 4 Brazilian Championships and 2 Copa Libertadores in 1976 and 1997, and was the first club of former two-time World Cup and Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Ronaldo. Atlético Mineiro also have notable players such as former goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel, who helped Brazil to the 1994 FIFA World Cup title. Both clubs however, have been relegated from the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A in previous seasons, notably Cruzeiro in 2019 and Atlético Mineiro in 2005.

Belo Horizonte is also home to América Mineiro, founded in 1912 current owner of Independência and considered the third force of the state. While the team&#x27;s struggles combined with the popularization of Atlético and Cruzeiro reduced América&#x27;s supporters, the team has won both the second and third levels of the Brazilian Championship, the Sul-Minas Cup in 2000, and 16 state championships, including a record dynasty of ten tournaments between 1916 and 1925. Both Villa Nova of Nova Lima and Betim Esporte Clube (when it was known as Ipatinga Futebol Clube) have won the state championship and been in Série A of the Brazilian league.

Besides football, Belo Horizonte has one of the largest attendances at volleyball matches in the whole country. Multisport club Minas Tênis Clube had its male and female teams win the Brazilian Superleague of Volleyball, with Contagem-based Sada Cruzeiro also winning the male tournament. Sada-Cruzeiro also won the FIVB World Club Championship two times in last 3 years, being one of the most successful volleyball team in the world. The Brazil national volleyball team has had some of its highest attendance numbers at Mineirinho, an arena located near the Mineirão stadium. On basketball, both Minas and Uberlândia&#x27;s Uberlândia Tênis Clube are in the national tournament.

==Communications==
As of April 2007, there are 11.3 million mobile phones and 4.2 million telephones in the country.

Minas Gerais (MG) cities area phone codes (called DDD in Brazil) are from 31 to 38.

==Culture==

Minas Gerais may be called &quot;Deep Brazil&quot; by analogy with &quot;France profonde&quot;. It has a distinctly more native flavour than cosmopolitan São Paulo, a more traditional slant than flashy Rio de Janeiro, and is more Portuguese than the South and São Paulo with their great influx of Italians and other Central Europeans, the North with its Native Americans, or the Northeast with its heavy Afro-Brazilian influence.

===People===
Those born and raised in Minas Gerais, also called Mineiros, bear an unmistakable accent that sets them apart from fellow Brazilians, although people born in different regions of the state bear slightly different accents, some resembling those of neighboring states, such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia. They are considered reserved, prudent but, at the same time, amicable, welcoming and family-focused. It is one of the most religious states, with a large proportion of staunch Roman Catholics and a burgeoning Evangelical and neo-Pentecostal population. The Spiritist doctrine is also professed by a significant portion of the population, partly due to the influence of Chico Xavier, the main spiritual icon of Brazil, who lived in Minas Gerais all his life.

=== Dialects ===
The most spoken dialect (48,6%) in the state is mineiro. It is the dialect spoken in the capital, Belo Horizonte, and the historical cities (Ouro Preto, Mariana, Sabará, Diamantina, Tiradentes, São João del-Rei etc.). The vernacular, dialectical speech of Minas Gerais is playfully and informally referred to—particularly with regard to its most idiosyncratic features—as .

Other dialects are caipira, spoken near the states of São Paulo and Goiás by 33,0%, and baiano, spoken in the Northern region – near Bahia – by 18,4%.

===Museums===

Mariano Procópio Museum, in Juiz de Fora, and Centro de Arte Contemporânea Inhotim, in Brumadinho, are among the most important cultural institutions.

===Cuisine===

Minas Gerais is known nationally for its cuisine. The cultural basis of its cuisine is the small farmhouse, and many of the dishes are prepared using locally produced vegetables and meats, especially chicken and pork. Traditional cooking is done using coal- or wood-fired ovens and cast iron pans, making for a particularly tasty flavor; some restaurant chains have adopted these techniques and made this type of food popular in other parts of the country.

Many of the cakes and appetizers of the local cuisine use corn or cassava (known there as &quot;mandioca&quot;) flour instead of wheat, as the latter did not adapt well to the local weather. The best-known dish from Minas Gerais is &quot;pão de queijo&quot;, a small baked roll (known internationally as &quot;Brazilian cheese rolls&quot;) made with cheese and cassava flour that can be served hot as an appetizer or for breakfast.

The state is also recognized for its doce de leite, since Minas Gerais is the largest producer of milk in the country. Minas Gerais is also Brazil&#x27;s most traditional producer of cheese. Minas cheese is renowned nationwide as the distinct Brazilian cheese. Cachaça is also a local produce of high importance, with the state owning hundreds of artisanal factories (in Minas and in the neighboring state of São Paulo, there is the world&#x27;s largest production of sugar cane, the basis of cachaça production). Typical of the state are Tropeiro beans with torresmo, Tutu de Feijão (Bean&#x27;s Tutu), chicken with okra stew, galinhada, a rice dish cooked with chicken corn and peas, handmade cheeses, goiabada, paçoca, pamonha, arroz com leite and others. Outside of Minas Gerais it is common to find restaurants specializing in food from the state.

The state cuisine is showcased in various festivals year round and in many locations throughout the state, but the biggest festival is the month-long Comida de Buteco in Belo Horizonte, where 41 bars and restaurants are selected to create a dish using ingredients traditional to local cuisine. People from all over the country and abroad rate the food, the temperature of the beer, the ambiance and service. In 2007, over 400,000 people participated in the festival according to Vox Populi statistics.

==Flag==

The flag of the state of Minas Gerais is the oldest one adopted in Brazil that was devised by Brazilians. It was remembered by the Republican Party, which opposed the Brazilian Imperial Government, and adopted unofficially as the flag of the state. It has been the official state flag since 1963.

The flag&#x27;s Latin inscription, &quot;Libertas quæ sera tamen&quot;, means &quot;Freedom albeit late&quot;, and was the motto of the Minas Gerais Conspiracy, which fought for Minas&#x27; independence from Portugal in the 18th century. The phrase was taken from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; 1.30. The triangle is said to represent the Holy Trinity. The colors were chosen for their revolutionary meaning: white represents the desire to form a peaceful nation, discarding all colonial institutions, and red the flame of liberty or the blood of the revolutionary martyrs such as Tiradentes.

==Cities==

In spite of not being the largest state of Brazil and ranking second in population, Minas Gerais has the largest number of cities. Of the more than 5,500 municipalities in the country, Minas has 853 of them, a fact explained by the number of inhabitants and by the vast territory, comparable in area to Madagascar and larger than Metropolitan France. The most notable cities are: the capital Belo Horizonte, Contagem, Betim, Juiz de Fora, Varginha, Muriaé, Montes Claros, Uberlândia, Governador Valadares, Ipatinga, Ouro Preto, Sete Lagoas, Uberaba, Araxá, Patos de Minas, Divinópolis, Barbacena, Itabira, Pouso Alegre, Janaúba, Teófilo Otoni, Conselheiro Lafaiete, Mariana, Poços de Caldas, Tiradentes and São João del-Rei.

<text>Badmotorfinger is the third studio album by American rock band Soundgarden, released on October 8, 1991, through A&amp;M Records. Soundgarden began the recording sessions for the album with new bassist Ben Shepherd in the spring of 1991. The album maintained the band&#x27;s heavy metal sound, while featuring an increased focus on songwriting compared to the band&#x27;s previous releases. AllMusic considered the album&#x27;s music to be &quot;surprisingly cerebral and arty&quot;; alternative tunings and odd time signatures were present on several of the album&#x27;s songs, and lyrics were intended to be ambiguous and evocative.

The focus on the Seattle grunge scene helped bring attention to &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, and the singles &quot;Outshined&quot; and &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; found a major audience in rock radio and MTV. &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; became the band&#x27;s highest charting album at the time on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it peaked at number 39. The album received critical acclaim, citing the significant improvements over earlier releases and evolution in the band&#x27;s sound. Soundgarden supported the album with tours of North America and Europe, including opening for Guns N&#x27; Roses on the Use Your Illusion Tour. In 1992, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1996.

==Writing==
&quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; has been classified by various critics as grunge, alternative metal, heavy metal and hard rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic said the songwriting on the album &quot;takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency&quot;, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences, but it attacks with scientific precision.&quot; Guitarist Kim Thayil jokingly called it the &quot;Heavy Metal &quot;White Album&quot;&quot;. Frontman Chris Cornell said, &quot;I think there&#x27;s songs on the new record which are almost more commercially viable because they have that memorable feel to them, and I think if anyone expected us to come out and make something more commercial than &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; [the band&#x27;s previous album], then I&#x27;m glad that they were surprised.&quot; He added that the album was more representative of how the band was live.

Compared with &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;, the band took a more collaborative approach to the writing process for &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;. It was Soundgarden&#x27;s first album with bassist Ben Shepherd, who replaced Jason Everman in April 1990, and Cornell said Shepherd brought a &quot;fresh and creative&quot; approach to the recording sessions, while the band as a whole said his knowledge of music and writing skills redefined the group. Before joining, Soundgarden had been Shepherd&#x27;s favorite band. Shepherd contributed the song &quot;Somewhere&quot; and collaborated on the musical composition of several other songs on the album, as did Thayil and drummer Matt Cameron. Thayil said Shepherd&#x27;s contributions helped make the album &quot;faster&quot; and &quot;weirder&quot;.

Several of the album&#x27;s songs utilize alternative tunings, such as &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, &quot;Searching with My Good Eye Closed&quot;, and &quot;Holy Water&quot; (on all of which the bottom E string of the guitars is tuned down to B), and &quot;Mind Riot&quot; (on which every string is tuned to one of several octaves of E). There are also some unusual time signatures on the album, &quot;Outshined&quot; is partially in 7/4 and &quot;Face Pollution&quot; is in 9/8. Thayil claimed the band did not deliberately pursue unusual meters, but rather was the result of a &quot;push to get the quirkiness out of things&quot;.

Regarding the lyrics, Cornell said he tried to not get too specific and was more interested in letting ambiguity &quot;[create] colourful images.&quot; Thayil compared listening to the album to &quot;reading a novel [about] man&#x27;s conflict with himself and society, or the government, or his family, or the economy, or anything.&quot; Cornell said &quot;Outshined&quot; is about going from &quot;periods of extreme self-confidence&quot; to &quot;plummeting in the opposite direction&quot;. &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; was written about famous people who exploit the symbol of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion to suggest they&#x27;re persecuted by the public. Thayil wrote the lyrics for &quot;Room a Thousand Years Wide&quot;, and said the song is about &quot;experience in general&quot;. &quot;Holy Water&quot; was written about people who force their beliefs onto others. &quot;New Damage&quot; subtly criticizes the right-wing government of the United States.

==Recording==
The album was recorded in the spring of 1991 at Studio D in Sausalito, California, Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, and A&amp;M Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date, as it had on &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;, because, according to Cornell, the band had a good relationship with Date and did not want to go through the pressure of trying to find a new producer. One example of the innovative techniques used to record the album is that, for the opening song, &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, Thayil used a wah pedal as an audio filter, which resulted in an unusual guitar sound he said produced a guitar riff that &quot;almost sounds backward&quot;.

==Artwork and title==
The &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; logo on the cover of the album was drawn by guitarist Mark Dancey of the Sub Pop band Big Chief and consists of a jagged, cyclone-like design, in the center of which is a triangle that has the album&#x27;s title along the interior perimeter and a spark plug in the middle. Thayil suggested the title &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; as a joke on the Montrose song &quot;Bad Motor Scooter&quot; and said, regarding the title: &quot;It was sort of off the top of my head. I simply like it because it was colorful. It was kinda aggressive, too ... It conjures up a lot of different kinds of images. We like the ambiguity in it, the way it sounded and the way it looked.&quot;

==Release and reception==
&quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; was scheduled for release on September 24, 1991, but A&amp;M Records pushed it back to October 8 due to &quot;production problems.&quot; Coming a month and a half after Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Ten&quot; and just weeks after Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; and Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; (both of which were released on September 24), it has been credited with helping to break alternative rock and grunge into the mainstream. Although overshadowed at the time of its release by the sudden popularity of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, the attention that album brought to the Seattle music scene helped Soundgarden get broader exposure, and &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; peaked at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart on February 29, 1992. It was among the 100 top selling albums of 1992, sold a million copies in the early 1990s, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 1993.

The album included the singles &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;, &quot;Outshined&quot;, and &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, which gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations. The music videos for &quot;Outshined&quot; and &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; gained considerable airtime on MTV, but the video for &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, was removed from MTV&#x27;s playlist amidst widespread controversy over the perceived anti-Christian message of the song and video. Promotion of the song also precipitated death threats against the band while they were on tour to support the album in the United Kingdom.

In a contemporary review for &quot;Spin&quot;, Lauren Spencer hailed &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; as a &quot;garden of sound&quot; that drew on older hard rock influences without sounding &quot;derivative&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Gina Arnold commended Soundgarden for writing more engagingly than their contemporaries, &quot;who seldom get beyond extolling booze, girls, and cars&quot;. She concluded in her review that the record was more &quot;stylishly bombastic rather than bludgeoningly bombastic. Tuneless heavy metal is, after all, still tuneless heavy metal, and in that department, Soundgarden are as functional as they make &#x27;em.&quot; Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, Keith Cameron said that the band had found &quot;a cool balance&quot; between Cornell&#x27;s &quot;bluesy screams&quot; and Thayil&#x27;s &quot;brutish riff powerplay&quot; on &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, rendering the album more &quot;stripped down, lithe and lethal&quot; than &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;. Retrospectively, AllMusic staff-writer Steve Huey deemed &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; &quot;heavy, challenging hard rock full of intellectual sensibility and complex band interplay&quot;, while Ann Powers of &quot;Blender&quot; commented that &quot;Cornell strikes the perfect Jesus Christ pose on this sonic wallop&quot;. Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, finding it &quot;credible&quot; as a metal record because of Thayil&#x27;s impressive use of guitar noise, but less impressive lyrically, writing: &quot;Chris Cornell howls on about &#x27;lookin for the paradigm&#x27; and &#x27;your Jesus Christ pose&#x27; (I swear, that&#x27;s the good stuff)&quot;.

At the 1992 Grammy Awards, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; received a nomination for Best Metal Performance. That same year, the album won a Northwest Area Music Award for Best Metal Album. 

It was ranked number 45 in the October 2006 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time. Also, in April 2019, was ranked number 2 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot; list.

Buzz Osborne, whose band Melvins had a massive influence on grunge, called &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; his favorite grunge album of all time, praising its sophistication and complex structures. In 2010, singer Greg Puciato named &quot;Room a Thousand Years Wide&quot; his favorite song.

===25th-anniversary reissues (2016)===
The 25th-anniversary reissue of &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; was made available in two deluxe versions:
* The &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; was a 2-CD package featuring a remastered version of the album on one disc and some studio outtakes and live tracks from a performance at the Paramount Theatre on the other.
* The &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot; was a 7 disc package: disc one was the remastered version of the album; disc two had studio outtakes; discs three and four consisted of live tracks from the performance at the Paramount Theatre, and disc five was a DVD of video footage of the same show; disc six featured &quot;Motorvision&quot;, a 1992 concert film depicting the band performing at the Paramount, alongside other live performances and the music videos for the album&#x27;s three singles; and disc seven contained the album mixed in Blu-ray Audio 5.1 Surround Sound. This release was packaged with various extras, and the first 1,000 people to pre-order it received an exclusive re-issue of the &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; single on 7&quot; vinyl.

A 2-LP gatefold of the album was also made available, with a limited edition of 1,000 produced using silver-colored vinyl.

The &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; reissue was created using a backup digital audio tape safety copy of the album, as the original master tapes were damaged or destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire, which affected the label group&#x27;s tape vault and purportedly destroyed material from hundreds of other recording artists. According to a document filed as part of a class action lawsuit Soundgarden and other artists brought against UMG as a result of the fire, the label made the band aware in May 2015 that the original half-inch master tape of &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; had been destroyed and was unavailable for use on the remaster project.

==Tour==
Following the release of &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, Soundgarden went on a tour in North America during October and November 1991. Following this tour, they were selected by Guns N&#x27; Roses for an opening slot on that band&#x27;s Use Your Illusion Tour. After this, Soundgarden took a slot opening for Skid Row in North America in February 1992 on that band&#x27;s &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; tour. Soundgarden then headed to Europe for a month-long headlining theater tour before returning to tour in the United States. They rejoined Guns N&#x27; Roses and the Use Your Illusion Tour in the summer of 1992 for a tour of Europe along with fellow opening act Faith No More. Regarding the time spent opening for Guns N&#x27; Roses, Cornell said: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of fun going out in front of 40,000 people for 35 minutes every day. Most of them hadn&#x27;t heard our songs and didn&#x27;t care about them. It was a bizarre thing.&quot; The band would go on to play the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam, among others. They later released &quot;Motorvision&quot;, which was filmed at the Paramount Theatre in 1992.

<text>The Five Guinea was a machine-struck gold coin produced from 1668–1753. Measuring 37 millimetres in diameter and weighing between 41 and 42 grams, it was the largest regularly produced gold coin in Britain. Although the coin is commonly known as the &quot;Five guinea&quot; piece, during the 17th and 18th centuries it was also known as a Five-pound piece, as the guinea was originally worth twenty shillings (i.e. a pound) – until its value was fixed at twenty-one shillings by a Royal Proclamation in 1717 the value fluctuated rather in the way that bullion coins do today.

This denomination shows the year of striking on the reverse; but also the edge inscription – &quot;An ornament and a safeguard, in the year of the reign...&quot; – is followed by the &quot;regnal year&quot; of the monarch, in Latin words. In the case of Charles II, the regnal year is calculated from the execution of Charles I, so 1668 is , &quot;the twentieth year of the reign&quot;. The edge inscription was put on the coin before the other two sides were struck – in the early years the blanks were cut out from a strip of gold which had been produced by horse power, then the blanks were sent to have the edge inscriptions impressed by a secret process devised by one Pierre Blondeau, a former engineer from the Paris mint who jealously guarded his methods. The blanks were then returned to the mint to have the obverse and reverse struck in a hand-operated press. Samuel Pepys gives a long and detailed description of the rolling, cutting, and striking of the blanks in his diary entry for 19 May 1663.

Many of the coins produced up to 1699 have an elephant and castle beneath the monarch&#x27;s head, indicating that the gold was provided by the Africa Company. Coins of 1703 (Queen Anne ) have the word VIGO under the Queen&#x27;s head, indicating that the gold was captured from Spanish galleons in the Battle of Vigo Bay in October 1702, but very few of these coins now remain in existence and are considered extremely valuable by collectors (an example sold for £845,000 at a New York auction in January 2019)

==Charles II==

The Five Guinea coin was produced in each year of Charles II&#x27;s reign from 1668 to 1684; before 1670 the weight limits were 41-42 grams, afterwards 41.0–41.8 grams. The obverse and reverse of this coin were designed by John Roettier (1631–c.1700). The obverse showed a fine right-facing bust of the king wearing a laurel wreath, surrounded by the legend , while the reverse showed four crowned cruciform shields bearing the arms of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, between which were four sceptres, and in the centre were four interlinked &quot;C&quot;s, surrounded by the inscription .

The regnal years used in this reign&#x27;s coin issue were:
==James II==
John Roettiers continued to design the dies for this denomination in the reign of King James II. In this reign, the weight of the coins varied between 41.5 and 42.0 grams. The king&#x27;s head faces left in this reign, and is surrounded by the inscription , while the obverse is the same as in Charles II&#x27;s reign except for omitting the interlinked &quot;C&quot;s in the centre of the coin.

The regnal years for this reign are:
==Mary II and William III==
With the removal of James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, his daughter Mary, and her husband Prince William of Orange ruled jointly by agreement as co-monarchs. Their heads appear conjoined on the five guinea piece in Roman style, with William&#x27;s head uppermost, with the legend . In a departure from the previous reigns the reverse featured a totally new design of a large crowned shield which bore the arms of France in the first quarter, of Scotland in the second quarter, of Ireland in the third quarter, and of England in the fourth quarter, the whole ensemble having a small shield in the centre bearing the rampant lion of Nassau; the legend on the obverse read . The weight tolerance of the coin in this reign was 41.5–41.8 grams. The five guinea coin of this reign was probably the work of James and/or Norbert Roettier.

The regnal years for this joint reign are:
==William III==
Following the death of Queen Mary II from smallpox in 1694, William continued to reign as William III, with his regnal years continuing to date from 1688. Five guinea coins were only produced in the last three years of his sole reign, the design probably being the work of Johann Crocker, also known as John Croker, since James Roettier had died in 1698 and his brother Norbert had left somewhat under a cloud for Paris in 1695.

The coins of William III&#x27;s reign weighed 41.6–41.7 grams. William&#x27;s head faces right on his coins, with the legend , while the reverse design of William and Mary&#x27;s reign was judged to be unsuccessful, so the design reverted to that used by Charles II and James II, but with a small shield with the lion of Nassau in the centre, with the legend .

The regnal years for this reign are:
==Anne==
The reign of Queen Anne (1702–1714) began with one of the most valuable and exotic of all British coins, the &quot;Vigo&quot; five guinea piece of 1703, which was struck from gold captured from Spanish galleons at the Battle of Vigo Bay in October 1702. A Royal Warrant of 10 February 1703 (1702 Old Style) authorised the word &quot;VIGO&quot; be placed &quot;under our effigies, which inscription we intend as a mark of distinction from the rest of our gold and silver moneys to continue to posterity the remembrance of that glorious action&quot;. At a sale of &quot;Vigo&quot; pieces in October 1992 the auctioneers, Glendining, noted that certainly fewer than twenty Vigo five guinea pieces survive.

Queen Anne five guineas were subsequently produced in 1705, 1706, 1709, 1711, 1713 and 1714. The obverse of the coin throughout her reign shows the left-facing effigy of the queen, with the legend .The general design of the reverse was similar to that of the previous reign, with four crowned cruciform shields bearing the arms of England, Scotland, Ireland, and France, separated by sceptres and with a central rose, and the legend . However, the union of England and Scotland necessitated a change in the design of the arms on the shield in 1706 (although the actual union took place on 1 May 1707, just over a month after the start of the year, the bill for the Act of Union received the Royal Assent on 6 March 1707 (that is, still in 1706 by the old-style calendar)), therefore coins dated 1706 appear with both reverses. The order of the arms appearing on the cruciform shields until 1706 was England, then Scotland, then France, then Ireland. With the union, the English and Scottish arms appear conjoined on one shield, with the left half being the English arms and the right half being the Scottish arms, and the order of arms appearing on the shields becomes England+Scotland, France, England+Scotland, Ireland. In 1706, with the Union, the central rose on the reverse was replaced by the Star of the Order of the Garter.

The regnal years for this reign are:
==George I==
George I&#x27;s Five Guinea coins were only struck in 1716, 1717, 1720, and 1726, and they bear his abbreviated Hanoverian titles in addition to the usual British, French, and Irish title. The obverse bears a right-facing portrait of the king with the legend . The reverse follows the same general design as before, except the order of the shields is England+Scotland, France, Ireland, and Hanover, with the legend – &quot;Duke of Brunswick and Lueneburg, Arch-Treasurer and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire&quot;. The coins of this reign weighed 41.7–41.8 grams.
The value of the guinea had fluctuated over the years from twenty to thirty shillings (in 1694), and back down to twenty one shillings and sixpence by the start of George&#x27;s reign. A Royal Proclamation of December 1717 fixed the value of the guinea at twenty one shillings.

The regnal years for this reign are:
==George II==
George II&#x27;s Five Guinea pieces mark the last of the denomination. The series began in 1729, and was also struck in 1731, 1735, 1738, 1741, 1746, 1748, and for the last time in 1753. The coins weighed 41.8–42.0 grams. Some of the 1729 coins bear the initials EIC under the king&#x27;s head, indicating the gold was supplied by the East India Company, while the 1746 coins have LIMA under the head, indicating the gold was obtained during Admiral Anson&#x27;s circumnavigation of the world (though the use of LIMA is something of a mystery, as there is no known connection with Peru).

The obverse has a left-facing bust of the king (with an older head from 1746), with the legend , while the reverse features a single large crowned shield with the quarters containing the arms of England+Scotland, France, Hanover, and Ireland, and the legend —&quot;King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Duke of Brunswick and Lueneburg, Arch-Treasurer and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire&quot;.

<doc id="222659" wikidata="Q615914" url="?curid=222659" title="Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean">
<text>Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean (, ) is a region in Quebec, Canada on the Labrador Peninsula. It contains the Saguenay Fjord, the estuary of the Saguenay River, stretching through much of the region. It is also known as Sagamie in French, from the first part of &quot;Saguenay&quot; and the last part of &quot;Piekouagami&quot;, the Innu name (meaning &quot;flat lake&quot;) for Lac Saint-Jean, with the final &quot;e&quot; added to follow the model of other existing region names such as Mauricie, Témiscamie, Jamésie, and Matawinie. With a land area of , Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean is the third-largest Quebec region after Nord-du-Québec and Côte-Nord.

This region is bathed by two major watercourses, Lac Saint-Jean and the Saguenay River, both of which mark its landscape deeply and have been the main drives of its development in history. It is also irrigated by several other large watercourses. Bordered by forests and mountainous massifs, the southern portion of the region constitutes a fertile enclave in the Canadian Shield called the Saguenay Graben. Both the scenery and the cultural sites and activities of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean attract tourists every year. Lac Saint-Jean is a popular vacation destination in the summer for residents of the more urban regions of Quebec.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Saguenay&quot; is possibly derived from the Innu word &quot;Saki-nip&quot; which means &quot;where water flows out&quot;.

==Population==
The population of the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region was 275,552 at the Canada 2021 Census, representing 3.2% of Quebec&#x27;s population. It is concentrated primarily in three clusters: the city of Saguenay (pop. 144,723), the city of Alma (pop. 30,331) and the agglomeration of Roberval (pop. 9,840), Saint-Félicien (pop. 10,089) and Dolbeau-Mistassini (pop. 13,718). Saguenay, the region&#x27;s largest city, is located slightly west of the fjord, mostly south of the river. It makes up 52.5% of the region&#x27;s population.

==Flag==
The flag was incorporated in 1938 on the centenary of the first settlers&#x27; arrival in 1838 and was created by Mgr. Victor Tremblay, a local historian. The four colours represent the four elements of the richness of Saguenay: the grey cross represents aluminum, which is an important product of local industry; the red border represents the inhabitants&#x27; labour; green, at the top represents the forest; and yellow, at the bottom, represents agriculture.

==Administrative divisions==
Following the Saguenay municipal reorganization in 2002, the region now counts 49 municipalities (including unorganized territories).

===Regional county municipalities===
* Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality (pop. 21,600)
* Lac-Saint-Jean-Est Regional County Municipality (pop. 52,741)

* Maria-Chapdelaine Regional County Municipality (pop. 24,793)

===Equivalent territory===
* Saguenay (pop. 144,746)

===Native reserve===
* Mashteuiatsh within Le Domaine-du-Roy, (pop. 2,213 Montagnais)

Additionally there were 0.1% who reported both French and a non-official language as their mother tongue.

As of 2021, Indigenous peoples comprised 5.1% of the population and visible minorities contributed 1.5%. The largest visible minority groups in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean are Black (0.7%), Arab (0.2%), and Latin American (0.2%). The region is home to 555 recent immigrants (i.e. those arriving between 2016 and 2021). 190 of them come from France, and 180 come from various African countries, with Cameroon leading at 75 recent immigrants.

In 2021, 73.4% of the population identified as Catholic, while 19.2% said they had no religious affiliation. Muslims were the largest religious minority, making up 0.3% of the population.

<doc id="222661" wikidata="Q845759" url="?curid=222661" title="Temple of the Dog">
<text>Temple of the Dog was an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. It was conceived by vocalist Chris Cornell of Soundgarden as a tribute to his friend, the late Andrew Wood, lead singer of the bands Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone. The lineup included Stone Gossard on rhythm guitar, Jeff Ament on bass guitar (both ex-members of Mother Love Bone and future members of Pearl Jam), Mike McCready (later Pearl Jam) on lead guitar, and Matt Cameron (Soundgarden and later Pearl Jam) on drums. Eddie Vedder appeared as a guest to provide some lead and backing vocals and later became lead vocalist of Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ten&quot;, was released four months after Temple of the Dog&#x27;s only studio album.

The band released its only album, the self-titled &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot;, in April 1991 through A&amp;M Records. The recording sessions took place in November and December 1990 at London Bridge Studio in Seattle, Washington, with producer Rakesh &quot;Rick&quot; Parashar. Although earning praise from music critics at the time of its release, the album was not widely recognized until 1992, when Vedder, Ament, Gossard, and McCready had their breakthrough with Pearl Jam (causing Temple of the Dog to sometimes be (retroactively) considered a supergroup). Cameron would later join Pearl Jam, serving as drummer since 1998, following Soundgarden&#x27;s initial break-up in 1997, making the five members of Pearl Jam after that point identical to the members of Temple of the Dog other than Chris Cornell.

The band reformed and toured in 2016 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their self-titled album. It was the only tour they ever undertook.

==History==
===Formation===
Temple of the Dog was started by Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, who had been a roommate of Andrew Wood, the lead singer of Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone. Wood died on March 19, 1990, of a heroin overdose. As he went on to tour Europe a few days later, he started writing songs in tribute to his late friend. The result was two songs, &quot;Reach Down&quot; and &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot;, which he recorded as soon as he returned home from touring.

The recorded material was slow and melodic, musically different from the aggressive rock music of Soundgarden. Cornell approached Wood&#x27;s former Mother Love Bone bandmates Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament—who were still figuring out what to do after the death of their singer and lyricist—with the intention of releasing the songs as a single. Ament described the collaboration as &quot;a really good thing at the time&quot; for Gossard and him that put them into a &quot;band situation where we could play and make music.&quot; The band&#x27;s lineup was completed by the addition of Soundgarden (and later Pearl Jam) drummer Matt Cameron and future Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready, who was Gossard&#x27;s childhood friend. They named themselves Temple of the Dog, a reference to a line in the lyrics of the Mother Love Bone song &quot;Man of Golden Words&quot;.

The band started rehearsing &quot;Reach Down&quot;, &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot;, and other songs that Cornell had written on tour prior to Wood&#x27;s death, as well as re-working some existing material from demos written by Gossard, Ament, and Cameron. One such demo became a song for two bands, recorded as &quot;Footsteps&quot; by Pearl Jam and &quot;Times of Trouble&quot; by Temple of the Dog. The idea of doing covers of Wood&#x27;s solo material also came up, but was abandoned quickly, as the band felt it would make people (including Wood&#x27;s close friends and relatives) think they were &quot;exploiting his material.&quot;

===Recording===
The release of a single was soon deemed a &quot;stupid idea&quot; by Cornell and dropped in favor of an EP or album. The album was recorded in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves, along with Rick Parashar of London Bridge Studio. Gossard described the recording process as a &quot;non-pressure-filled&quot; situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up to Seattle from San Diego to audition to be the singer of Ament, Gossard, and McCready&#x27;s new band, Mookie Blaylock (named for a basketball player, the band would later be renamed Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals, and ended up providing backing vocals on a few songs, with &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; becoming a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks, singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell. As Cornell later described it: &quot;He sang half of that song not even knowing that I&#x27;d wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively.&quot; &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; became Temple of the Dog&#x27;s breakout single. It was also Vedder&#x27;s first featured vocal on a record. In the 2011 documentary &quot;Pearl Jam Twenty&quot;, Vedder states: &quot;That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I&#x27;ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.&quot;

===Release and delayed success===
&quot;Temple of the Dog&quot;, the band&#x27;s self-titled album, was released on April 16, 1991, through A&amp;M Records and initially sold 70,000 copies in the United States. Ament recalled requesting that A&amp;M include a Pearl Jam sticker on the cover—as they had just picked their new name—because &quot;it&#x27;ll be a good thing for us&quot;, but they refused. The album received favorable reviews, but failed to chart. Critic Steve Huey of AllMusic later gave the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that the &quot;record sounds like a bridge between Mother Love Bone&#x27;s theatrical &#x27;70s-rock updates and Pearl Jam&#x27;s hard-rocking seriousness.&quot; David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, in retrospect, that the album &quot;deserves immortality.&quot; The band members were pleased with the material, as it achieved its purpose; Cornell believed that &quot;Andy really would have liked&quot; the songs, and Gossard also asserted that he thought Wood would be &quot;blown away by the whole thing&quot;. Soon after the album&#x27;s release, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam embarked on recording their own albums, and the Temple of the Dog project was brought to a close, without a promotional tour for the album.

In the summer of 1992, the album received renewed attention. Although it had been released more than a year earlier, A&amp;M Records realized that they had in their catalog what was essentially a collaboration between Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, who had both risen to mainstream attention in the months since the album&#x27;s release with their respective albums, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; and &quot;Ten&quot;. A&amp;M decided to reissue the album and promote &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; as a single, with an accompanying music video that had been previously filmed. The attention allowed both the album and single to chart on Billboard charts and resulted in a boost in album sales. The album ended up being among the 100 top-selling albums of 1992, and it has sold more than a million copies, achieving a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.

===Subsequent events===
McCready, Ament, Cameron, and Cornell later reunited under the name M.A.C.C. to record a cover of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Hey Baby (Land of the New Rising Sun)&quot; for the 1993 tribute album &quot;Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;. The song has since been included as part of the band&#x27;s live set. In a 2007 interview with Ultimate Guitar Archive, Cornell stated he would be open to a Temple of the Dog reunion, or &quot;some collaboration with any combination of those guys&quot;. He also revealed that Temple of the Dog was the reason he joined Audioslave, as the experience made him &quot;keep an open mind&quot; about collaborations with musicians from other bands.

==Live performances==
During their initial existence, the only time Temple of the Dog played a full one-hour set was while rehearsing and writing the material for the album. The band (with the exception of Vedder) performed in Seattle at the Off Ramp Café on November 13, 1990. They also opened for Alice in Chains, following the short lived Seattle group Panic, on December 22, 1990, at the Moore Theatre in Seattle.

In the time since the album&#x27;s release, the band has re-formed for short live one-off performances on occasions where both Soundgarden and Pearl Jam were performing. Temple of the Dog performed &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; on October 3, 1991, at the Foundations Forum in Los Angeles, California; a three-song set on October 6, 1991, at the Hollywood Palladium in Hollywood for the &quot;RIP&quot; Magazine 5th anniversary party (Temple of the Dog played after secret headlining act Spinal Tap); and &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; on both August 14, 1992, at Lake Fairfax Park in Reston, Virginia, and September 13, 1992, at Irvine Meadows Amphitheater in Irvine, California (both shows were part of the Lollapalooza festival series in 1992). The band also played &quot;Reach Down&quot; on the latter occasion.

At a Pearl Jam show at the Santa Barbara Bowl in Santa Barbara, California, on October 28, 2003, Cornell joined the band on-stage, effectively reuniting Temple of the Dog (Cameron had been the drummer for Pearl Jam since 1998) for renditions of &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; and &quot;Reach Down&quot;. Cornell also performed Audioslave&#x27;s &quot;Like a Stone&quot; and Chris Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Change Me&quot;. The version of &quot;Reach Down&quot; recorded that night later appeared on Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2003 fan club Christmas single. Pearl Jam has also been known to perform, on rare occasions, &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; live without Cornell.

Cornell&#x27;s post-Soundgarden band, Audioslave, added &quot;All Night Thing&quot;, &quot;Call Me a Dog&quot;, and &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; to its live set in 2005. Additionally, Cornell added the aforementioned songs, plus &quot;Pushin Forward Back&quot;, &quot;Wooden Jesus&quot;, &quot;Reach Down&quot;, and &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot;, to his solo live set.

On October 6, 2009, Cornell joined Pearl Jam onstage to perform &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; in Los Angeles, effectively reuniting Temple of the Dog once again. After this, a fan group emerged on Facebook in April 2010 to encourage a 20th anniversary benefit reunion tour, to begin on April 16, 2011.

During Labor Day weekend, 2011, Cornell joined Pearl Jam onstage at Alpine Valley in Wisconsin for PJ20 (Pearl Jam&#x27;s twentieth anniversary celebration). On September 3, he joined them for a four-song set, which included the songs &quot;Stardog Champion&quot; (a Mother Love Bone cover with Cornell on vocals), &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot;, &quot;Reach Down&quot;, and &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;. The next day, he joined them for &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;, &quot;Call Me a Dog&quot;, &quot;All Night Thing&quot;, and &quot;Reach Down&quot; (which also included Glen Hansard, Dhani Harrison of Thenewno2, Davíd Garza, and Liam Finn).

On both October 25 and 26, 2014, Cornell joined Pearl Jam onstage to perform &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California, during the 28th Annual Bridge School Benefit. The October 26 concert marked the last time that Vedder and Cornell performed the song together.

On January 30, 2015, Pearl Jam bandmates Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, and Matt Cameron joined Chris Cornell and Mike McCready during the Mad Season Sonic Evolution Concert at Benaroya Hall with the Seattle Symphony. The group performed two songs from the album: &quot;Reach Down&quot; and &quot;Call Me a Dog&quot;.

Temple of the Dog finally officially toured in the fall of 2016 in celebration of the 25th anniversary of their self-titled album. Vedder did not participate in the tour, citing &quot;family commitments&quot;, so, at the band&#x27;s concert at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle on November 21, 2016, the crowd sang his part in &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; and Cornell dedicated the song to him.

On November 23rd, 2024, Pearl Jam performed &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; in Sydney, asking the crowd to sing Cornell&#x27;s part. This was the first live performance of the track since Cornell&#x27;s death.

<doc id="222663" wikidata="Q33826" url="?curid=222663" title="Mura language">
<text>Mura is a language of Amazonas, Brazil. It is most famous for Pirahã, its sole surviving dialect. Linguistically, it is typified by agglutinativity, a very small phoneme inventory (around 11 compared to around 44 in English), whistled speech, and the use of tone. In the 19th century, there were an estimated 30,000–60,000 Mura speakers. It is now spoken by only 300 Pirahã people in eight villages.

==Dialects==
Since at least Barboza Rodrigues (1892), there have been three ethnic names commonly listed as dialects of Mura, or even as Muran languages. The names are:
* Bohurá, or &quot;Buxwaray&quot;, the original form of the name &#x27;Mura&#x27;; spoken on the Autaz River
* Pirahã, or &quot;Pirahá, Pirahán&quot;, the name the remaining dialect goes by
* Yahahí, also spelled &quot;Jahahi&quot;; spoken on the Branco River
On the basis of a minuscule amount of data, it would appear that Bohurá (Mura proper) was mutually intelligible with Pirahã; however, for Yahahí there exists only ethnographic information, and it can be assumed they spoke the same language as other Mura. Rodrigues describes the Yahahí as having come from the Branco river, a tributary of the right bank of the upper Marmelos river. The last Yahahí are said to have joined the Pirahã.

The Mura/Bohurá endonym is , according to Barboza Rodrigues (1892), or ~ , according to Tastevin (1923). This was pronounced &quot;Murá&quot; by their neighbors, the Torá and Matanawi. In his vocabulary, Rodrigues lists &quot;Bohura&quot; for the people and &quot;bhũrai-ada&quot; &quot;Mura language&quot; for the language, from the Mura of the Manicoré River; Tastevin has &quot;Bohurai&quot; and &quot;bohuarai-arasé&quot; for the same. They also record,

: &quot;That one is Mura&quot;
: &quot;We are all Mura&quot;

==Genealogical relations==
Mura is often proposed to be related to Matanawí. Kaufman (1994) also suggests a connection with Huarpe in his &quot;Macro-Warpean&quot; proposal.

==Vocabulary==
Loukotka (1968) lists the following basic vocabulary items for Mura language varieties.

Below is a comparison of Mura and Pirahã words from Salles (2023):

<doc id="222665" wikidata="Q3075198" url="?curid=222665" title="McCarthy 91 function">
<text>The McCarthy 91 function is a recursive function, defined by the computer scientist John McCarthy as a test case for formal verification within computer science.

The McCarthy 91 function is defined as

:formula_1

The results of evaluating the function are given by &quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 91 for all integer arguments &quot;n&quot; ≤ 100, and &quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot; − 10 for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 100. Indeed, the result of M(101) is also 91 (101 - 10 = 91). All results of M(n) after n = 101 are continually increasing by 1, e.g. M(102) = 92, M(103) = 93.

==History==
The 91 function was introduced in papers published by Zohar Manna, Amir Pnueli and John McCarthy in 1970. These papers represented early developments towards the application of formal methods to program verification. The 91 function was chosen for being nested-recursive (contrasted with single recursion, such as defining formula_2 by means of formula_3). The example was popularized by Manna&#x27;s book, &quot;Mathematical Theory of Computation&quot; (1974). As the field of Formal Methods advanced, this example appeared repeatedly in the research literature.
In particular, it is viewed as a &quot;challenge problem&quot; for automated program verification.

It is easier to reason about tail-recursive control flow, this is an equivalent (extensionally equal) definition:
:formula_4
:formula_5
As one of the examples used to demonstrate such reasoning, Manna&#x27;s book includes a tail-recursive algorithm equivalent to the nested-recursive 91 function. Many of the papers that report an &quot;automated verification&quot; (or termination proof) of the 91 function only handle the tail-recursive version.

This is an equivalent mutually tail-recursive definition:
:formula_6
:formula_7
:formula_8
A formal derivation of the mutually tail-recursive version from the nested-recursive one was given in a 1980 article by Mitchell Wand, based on the use of continuations.

==Examples==
Example A:

 M(99) = M(M(110)) since 99 ≤ 100
 = M(100) since 110 &gt; 100
 = M(M(111)) since 100 ≤ 100
 = M(101) since 111 &gt; 100
 = 91 since 101 &gt; 100

Example B:

 M(87) = M(M(98))
 = M(M(M(109)))
 = M(M(99))
 = M(M(M(110)))
 = M(M(100))
 = M(M(M(111)))
 = M(M(101))
 = M(91)
 = M(M(102))
 = M(92)
 = M(M(103))
 = M(93)
 ... Pattern continues increasing till M(99), M(100) and M(101), exactly as we saw on the example A)
 = M(101) since 111 &gt; 100
 = 91 since 101 &gt; 100

==Code==
Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in Lisp:
(defun mc91 (n)
 (cond ((&lt;= n 100) (mc91 (mc91 (+ n 11))))
 (t (- n 10))))
Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in Haskell:
mc91 n 
 | n &gt; 100 = n - 10
 | otherwise = mc91 $ mc91 $ n + 11
Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in OCaml:
let rec mc91 n =
 if n &gt; 100 then n - 10
 else mc91 (mc91 (n + 11))
Here is an implementation of the tail-recursive algorithm in OCaml:
let mc91 n =
 let rec aux n c =
 if c = 0 then n
 else if n &gt; 100 then aux (n - 10) (c - 1)
 else aux (n + 11) (c + 1)
 in
 aux n 1
Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in Python:
def mc91(n: int) -&gt; int:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;McCarthy 91 function.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if n &gt; 100:
 return n - 10
 else:
 return mc91(mc91(n + 11))
Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in C:
int mc91(int n)
 if (n &gt; 100) {
 return n - 10;
 } else {
 return mc91(mc91(n + 11));
}
Here is an implementation of the tail-recursive algorithm in C:
int mc91(int n)
 return mc91taux(n, 1);

int mc91taux(int n, int c)
 if (c != 0) {
 if (n &gt; 100) {
 return mc91taux(n - 10, c - 1);
 } else {
 return mc91taux(n + 11, c + 1);
 } else {
 return n;
}
==Proof==
Here is a proof that the McCarthy 91 function formula_9 is equivalent to the non-recursive algorithm formula_10defined as:
:formula_11

For &quot;n&quot; &gt; 100, the definitions of formula_10 and formula_9 are the same. The equality therefore follows from the definition of formula_9.

For &quot;n&quot; ≤ 100, a strong induction downward from 100 can be used:

For 90 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ 100,

 M(n) = M(M(n + 11)), by definition
 = M(n + 11 - 10), since n + 11 &gt; 100
 = M(n + 1)
This can be used to show &quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;M&quot;(101) = 91 for 90 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ 100:
 M(90) = M(91), M(n) = M(n + 1) was proven above
 = M(101), by definition
 = 101 − 10
 = 91

&quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;M&quot;(101) = 91 for 90 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ 100 can be used as the base case of the induction.

For the downward induction step, let &quot;n&quot; ≤ 89 and assume &quot;M&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) = 91 for all &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;i&quot; ≤ 100, then

 M(n) = M(M(n + 11)), by definition
 = M(91), by hypothesis, since n &lt; n + 11 ≤ 100
 = 91, by the base case.

This proves &quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 91 for all &quot;n&quot; ≤ 100, including negative values.

== Knuth&#x27;s generalization ==

Donald Knuth generalized the 91 function to include additional parameters. John Cowles developed a formal proof that Knuth&#x27;s generalized function was total, using the ACL2 theorem prover.

<doc id="222666" wikidata="Q877561" url="?curid=222666" title="ISO 3166-3">
<text>ISO 3166-3 is part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and defines codes for country names which have been deleted from ISO 3166-1 since its first publication in 1974. The official name of the standard is &quot;Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions – Part 3: Code for formerly used names of countries&quot;. It was first published in 1999.

Each former country name in ISO 3166-3 is assigned a four-letter alphabetic code. The first two letters are the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the former country, while the last two letters are allocated according to the following rules:
* If the country changed its name, the new ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code is used (e.g., Burma changed its name to Myanmar, whose new alpha-2 code is ), or the special code is used if its alpha-2 code was not changed (e.g., Byelorussian SSR changed its name to Belarus, which has kept the same alpha-2 code).
* If the country merged into an existing country, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of this country is used (e.g., the German Democratic Republic merged into Germany, whose alpha-2 code is ).
* If the country was divided into several parts, the special code is used to indicate that there is no single successor country (e.g., Czechoslovakia was divided into the Czech Republic and Slovakia), with the exception of Serbia and Montenegro, for which is used to avoid duplicate use of the same ISO 3166-3 code, as the alpha-2 code had twice been deleted from ISO 3166-1, the first time due to the split of Czechoslovakia and the second time due to the split of Serbia and Montenegro.

Besides the former country name and its ISO 3166-3 code, each entry in ISO 3166-3 also contains its former ISO 3166-1 codes, its period of validity, and the new country names and ISO 3166-1 codes used after its deletion from ISO 3166-1.

After a country is deleted from ISO 3166-1, its alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes will be transitionally reserved for a transitional period of at least fifty years. After the expiration of the transitional period, these codes are free to be reassigned.

If a country changes its name without any territorial change, its ISO 3166-1 numeric code remains the same. For example, when Burma was renamed Myanmar without territorial change in 1989, its alphabetic codes were changed, but its numeric code has remained the same.

Currently, a few ccTLDs using deleted alpha-2 codes are still active or being phased out. However, alpha-2 codes which were deleted before the popularization of the Domain Name System in the late 1980s and early 1990s were never used for the Internet&#x27;s country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Likewise, ISO 3166-2, the ISO standard for country subdivision codes which was first published in 1998, predated the deletion of many alpha-2 codes.

==Current codes==
The following is a list of current ISO 3166-3 codes, with the following columns:
* Former country name – English short country name officially used by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA)

<doc id="222676" wikidata="Q900337" url="?curid=222676" title="Lewis acids and bases">
<text>A Lewis acid (named for the American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis) is a chemical species that contains an empty orbital which is capable of accepting an electron pair from a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct. A Lewis base, then, is any species that has a filled orbital containing an electron pair which is not involved in bonding but may form a dative bond with a Lewis acid to form a Lewis adduct. For example, NH3 is a Lewis base, because it can donate its lone pair of electrons. Trimethylborane [(CH3)3B] is a Lewis acid as it is capable of accepting a lone pair. In a Lewis adduct, the Lewis acid and base share an electron pair furnished by the Lewis base, forming a dative bond. In the context of a specific chemical reaction between NH3 and Me3B, a lone pair from NH3 will form a dative bond with the empty orbital of Me3B to form an adduct NH3•BMe3. The terminology refers to the contributions of Gilbert N. Lewis.

The terms &quot;nucleophile&quot; and &quot;electrophile&quot; are sometimes interchangeable with Lewis base and Lewis acid, respectively. These terms, especially their abstract noun forms &quot;nucleophilicity&quot; and &quot;electrophilicity&quot;, emphasize the kinetic aspect of reactivity, while the Lewis basicity and Lewis acidity emphasize the thermodynamic aspect of Lewis adduct formation.

==Depicting adducts==
In many cases, the interaction between the Lewis base and Lewis acid in a complex is indicated by an arrow indicating the Lewis base donating electrons toward the Lewis acid using the notation of a dative bond — for example, ←. Some sources indicate the Lewis base with a pair of dots (the explicit electrons being donated), which allows consistent representation of the transition from the base itself to the complex with the acid:

A center dot may also be used to represent a Lewis adduct, such as . Another example is boron trifluoride diethyl etherate, . In a slightly different usage, the center dot is also used to represent hydrate coordination in various crystals, as in for hydrated magnesium sulfate, irrespective of whether the water forms a dative bond with the metal.

Although there have been attempts to use computational and experimental energetic criteria to distinguish dative bonding from non-dative covalent bonds, for the most part, the distinction merely makes note of the source of the electron pair, and dative bonds, once formed, behave simply as other covalent bonds do, though they typically have considerable polar character. Moreover, in some cases (e.g., sulfoxides and amine oxides as and ), the use of the dative bond arrow is just a notational convenience for avoiding the drawing of formal charges. In general, however, the donor–acceptor bond is viewed as simply somewhere along a continuum between idealized covalent bonding and ionic bonding.

==Lewis acids==

Lewis acids are diverse and the term is used loosely. Simplest are those that react directly with the Lewis base, such as boron trihalides and the pentahalides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony.

In the same vein, can be considered to be the Lewis acid in methylation reactions. However, the methyl cation never occurs as a free species in the condensed phase, and methylation reactions by reagents like CH3I take place through the simultaneous formation of a bond from the nucleophile to the carbon and cleavage of the bond between carbon and iodine (SN2 reaction). Textbooks disagree on this point: some asserting that alkyl halides are electrophiles but not Lewis acids, while others describe alkyl halides (e.g. CH3Br) as a type of Lewis acid. The IUPAC states that Lewis acids and Lewis bases react to form Lewis adducts, and defines electrophile as Lewis acids.

===Simple Lewis acids===
Some of the most studied examples of such Lewis acids are the boron trihalides and organoboranes:
:BF3 + F− → 
In this adduct, all four fluoride centres (or more accurately, ligands) are equivalent.
:BF3 + OMe2 → BF3OMe2
Both BF4− and BF3OMe2 are Lewis base adducts of boron trifluoride.

Many adducts violate the octet rule, such as the triiodide anion:
:I2 + I− → 
The variability of the colors of iodine solutions reflects the variable abilities of the solvent to form adducts with the Lewis acid I2.

Some Lewis acids bind with two Lewis bases, a famous example being the formation of hexafluorosilicate:
:SiF4 + 2 F− → 

===Complex Lewis acids===
Most compounds considered to be Lewis acids require an activation step prior to formation of the adduct with the Lewis base. Complex compounds such as Et3Al2Cl3 and AlCl3 are treated as trigonal planar Lewis acids but exist as aggregates and polymers that must be degraded by the Lewis base. A simpler case is the formation of adducts of borane. Monomeric BH3 does not exist appreciably, so the adducts of borane are generated by degradation of diborane:
:B2H6 + 2 H− → 2 
In this case, an intermediate can be isolated.

Many metal complexes serve as Lewis acids, but usually only after dissociating a more weakly bound Lewis base, often water.
:[Mg(H2O)6]2+ + 6 NH3 → [Mg(NH3)6]2+ + 6 H2O

===H+ as Lewis acid===
The proton (H+)  is one of the strongest but is also one of the most complicated Lewis acids. It is convention to ignore the fact that a proton is heavily solvated (bound to solvent). With this simplification in mind, acid-base reactions can be viewed as the formation of adducts:
*H+ + NH3 → 
*H+ + OH− → H2O

===Applications of Lewis acids===
A typical example of a Lewis acid in action is in the Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction. The key step is the acceptance by AlCl3 of a chloride ion lone-pair, forming and creating the strongly acidic, that is, electrophilic, carbonium ion.
:RCl +AlCl3 → R+ + 

==Lewis bases==
A Lewis base is an atomic or molecular species where the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is highly localized. Typical Lewis bases are conventional amines such as ammonia and alkyl amines. Other common Lewis bases include pyridine and its derivatives. They are nucleophilic in nature

Some of the main classes of Lewis bases are:
*amines of the formula NH3−xRx where R = alkyl or aryl. Related to these are pyridine and its derivatives.
*phosphines of the formula PR3−xArx.
*compounds of O, S, Se and Te in oxidation state −2, including water, ethers, ketones

The most common Lewis bases are anions. The strength of Lewis basicity correlates with the of the parent acid: acids with high &#x27;s give good Lewis bases. As usual, a weaker acid has a stronger conjugate base.

* Examples of Lewis bases based on the general definition of electron pair donor include:
**simple anions, such as H− and F−
**other lone-pair-containing species, such as H2O, NH3, HO−, and CH3−
**complex anions, such as sulfate
**electron-rich -system Lewis bases, such as ethyne, ethene, and benzene

The strength of Lewis bases have been evaluated for various Lewis acids, such as I2, SbCl5, and BF3.
===Applications of Lewis bases===

Nearly all electron pair donors that form compounds by binding transition elements can be viewed ligands. Thus, a large application of Lewis bases is to modify the activity and selectivity of metal catalysts. Chiral Lewis bases, generally multidentate, confer chirality on a catalyst, enabling asymmetric catalysis, which is useful for the production of pharmaceuticals. The industrial synthesis of the anti-hypertension drug mibefradil uses a chiral Lewis base (&quot;R&quot;-MeOBIPHEP), for example.

== Hard and soft classification ==

Lewis acids and bases are commonly classified according to their hardness or softness. In this context hard implies small and nonpolarizable and soft indicates larger atoms that are more polarizable.
*typical hard acids: H+, alkali/alkaline earth metal cations, boranes, Zn2+
*typical soft acids: Ag+, Mo(0), Ni(0), Pt2+
*typical hard bases: ammonia and amines, water, carboxylates, fluoride and chloride
*typical soft bases: organophosphines, thioethers, carbon monoxide, iodide

For example, an amine will displace phosphine from the adduct with the acid BF3. In the same way, bases could be classified. For example, bases donating a lone pair from an oxygen atom are harder than bases donating through a nitrogen atom. Although the classification was never quantified it proved to be very useful in predicting the strength of adduct formation, using the key concepts that hard acid—hard base and soft acid—soft base interactions are stronger than hard acid—soft base or soft acid—hard base interactions. Later investigation of the thermodynamics of the interaction suggested that hard—hard interactions are enthalpy favored, whereas soft—soft are entropy favored.

== Quantifying Lewis acidity==
Many methods have been devised to evaluate and predict Lewis acidity. Many are based on spectroscopic signatures such as shifts NMR signals or IR bands e.g. the Gutmann-Beckett method and the Childs method.

The ECW model is a quantitative model that describes and predicts the strength of Lewis acid base interactions, −ΔH. The model assigned E and C parameters to many Lewis acids and bases. Each acid is characterized by an EA and a CA. Each base is likewise characterized by its own EB and CB. The E and C parameters refer, respectively, to the electrostatic and covalent contributions to the strength of the bonds that the acid and base will form. The equation is

: −ΔH = EAEB + CACB + W

The W term represents a constant energy contribution for acid–base reaction such as the cleavage of a dimeric acid or base. The equation predicts reversal of acids and base strengths. The graphical presentations of the equation show that there is no single order of Lewis base strengths or Lewis acid strengths. and that single property scales are limited to a smaller range of acids or bases.

==History==

The concept originated with Gilbert N. Lewis who studied chemical bonding. In 1923, Lewis wrote &quot;An acid substance is one which can employ an electron lone pair from another molecule in completing the stable group of one of its own atoms.&quot; The Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory was published in the same year. The two theories are distinct but complementary. A Lewis base is also a Brønsted–Lowry base, but a Lewis acid does not need to be a Brønsted–Lowry acid. The classification into hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB theory) followed in 1963. The strength of Lewis acid-base interactions, as measured by the standard enthalpy of formation of an adduct can be predicted by the Drago–Wayland two-parameter equation.

===Reformulation of Lewis theory===
Lewis had suggested in 1916 that two atoms are held together in a chemical bond by sharing a pair of electrons. When each atom contributed one electron to the bond, it was called a covalent bond. When both electrons come from one of the atoms, it was called a dative covalent bond or coordinate bond. The distinction is not very clear-cut. For example, in the formation of an ammonium ion from ammonia and hydrogen the ammonia molecule donates a pair of electrons to the proton; the identity of the electrons is lost in the ammonium ion that is formed. Nevertheless, Lewis suggested that an electron-pair donor be classified as a base and an electron-pair acceptor be classified as acid.

A more modern definition of a Lewis acid is an atomic or molecular species with a localized empty atomic or molecular orbital of low energy. This lowest-energy molecular orbital (LUMO) can accommodate a pair of electrons.

=== Comparison with Brønsted–Lowry theory ===
A Lewis base is often a Brønsted–Lowry base as it can donate a pair of electrons to H+; the proton is a Lewis acid as it can accept a pair of electrons. The conjugate base of a Brønsted–Lowry acid is also a Lewis base as loss of H+ from the acid leaves those electrons which were used for the A—H bond as a lone pair on the conjugate base. However, a Lewis base can be very difficult to protonate, yet still react with a Lewis acid. For example, carbon monoxide is a very weak Brønsted–Lowry base but it forms a strong adduct with BF3.

In another comparison of Lewis and Brønsted–Lowry acidity by Brown and Kanner, 2,6-di-&quot;t&quot;-butylpyridine reacts to form the hydrochloride salt with HCl but does not react with BF3. This example demonstrates that steric factors, in addition to electron configuration factors, play a role in determining the strength of the interaction between the bulky di-&quot;t&quot;-butylpyridine and tiny proton.

<text>Animacy (antonym: inanimacy) is a grammatical and semantic feature, existing in some languages, expressing how sentient or alive the referent of a noun is. Widely expressed, animacy is one of the most elementary principles in languages around the globe and is a distinction acquired as early as six months of age.

Concepts of animacy constantly vary beyond a simple animate and inanimate binary; many languages function off an hierarchical general animacy scale that ranks animacy as a &quot;matter of gradience&quot;. Typically (with some variation of order and of where the cutoff for animacy occurs), the scale ranks humans above animals, then plants, natural forces, concrete objects, and abstract objects, in that order. In referring to humans, this scale contains a hierarchy of persons, ranking the first- and second-person pronouns above the third person, partly a product of empathy, involving the speaker and interlocutor.

==Types of Animacy==
De Swart and de Hoop (2018) emphasize the importance of distinguishing between three types of animacy: biological, conceptual, and grammatical. Each of these types plays a unique role in understanding how humans perceive and express the distinction between animate and inanimate entities.

Biological animacy refers to entities that are biologically alive and is defined by physical properties like the capacity to die. Living entities, such as humans, animals, and plants, are considered biologically &quot;animate,&quot; whereas non-living entities, like rocks or water, are classified as &quot;inanimate.&quot; This type of animacy forms the foundation of how humans instinctively categorize the world around them.

Conceptual animacy is based on the speaker’s perception and cultural background. It concerns what is perceived as alive, influenced by the “ego’s” perspective and societal beliefs. This type often diverges from biological animacy. For example, in some cultures or languages, inanimate objects like the sun or mountains are considered &quot;animate&quot; due to mythology or cultural beliefs. Conceptual animacy reflects how humans personify or attribute agency to non-living entities.

Grammatical animacy demonstrates how biological and conceptual animacy are represented in the grammar of languages. It operates as a semantic feature or condition influencing linguistic structures, such as verb agreement or case marking. For instance, in Russian, animacy distinctions affect object marking in sentences; animate nouns, such as humans and animals, are treated differently than inanimate nouns. This type of animacy illustrates the interaction between cognitive perceptions and linguistic systems.

The animacy hierarchy (e.g., human &gt; animal &gt; inanimate) is widely applied in linguistic analysis to explain various phenomena. Animate entities are more likely to act as agents or subjects in sentences (agentivity), receive distinct grammatical treatment in case marking or agreement, and be referenced explicitly in discourse. Additionally, animacy hierarchies are not static; cultural factors or temporary discourse contexts can shift these classifications.

Although animacy distinctions appear universally across languages, their specific implementation varies. For example, Navajo uses animacy to govern verb marking, while Slavic languages reflect animacy distinctions in noun declensions. However, the universality of animacy as a linguistic feature is debated due to its variability across languages. Cultural and functional factors can lead to unique animacy hierarchies, showing that animacy is both a universal and context-dependent concept.

==Techniques for Expressing Animacy in Language==
Animacy can function in language as either a feature (AnimF) or a condition (AnimC), with some languages employing both simultaneously. These two roles highlight distinct ways animacy interacts with linguistic systems.

Animacy as a Feature (AnimF) operates as a semantic characteristic that influences specific word or morpheme classes. It is used to encode grammatical values such as person, number, case, and gender, introducing a semantic distinction based on animacy. AnimF may involve changing the shape of a word or adding morphological material to reflect whether an entity is animate or inanimate. However, it does not fundamentally alter the grammatical feature itself; instead, it adds a layer of semantic meaning. For instance, it often distinguishes between animate and inanimate entities while maintaining the existing grammatical structure.

Animacy as a Condition (AnimC) demonstrates how animacy governs various grammatical features within a language. It influences linguistic paradigms by reorganizing them based on the animacy of entities. For example, in Bunak, a prefixed bound pronoun is attached to a verb only if the direct object is animate. Animacy also affects gender agreement, where animacy distinctions can control gender markers even in systems that are not primarily animacy-based. Similarly, case marking and agreement controllers may vary depending on animacy. For instance, certain languages use different case markers or allomorphs for animate versus inanimate nouns. AnimC showcases how semantic properties like animacy can streamline linguistic structures and reduce morphological complexity.

To express animacy distinctions, languages employ a variety of techniques:

===Affixation===
Prefixes or suffixes are added to roots or stems to mark animacy distinctions. Prefixation typically involves free elements, clitics, or true prefixes, while suffixation often adds markers for features like case or number alongside animacy.

===Alternation===
This involves changing the morphological or phonological structure of a word without adding new material. It may include pure alternation, adjustments in grammatical features, or techniques to either create or avoid syncretism (merging distinct forms).

===Overt Free Elements===
Independent words are introduced in sentences to signify animacy, rather than altering the morphology of existing words.

===Reduplication===
Parts of a word are repeated, often in pluralization, to mark distinctions between animate and inanimate nouns.

===Zero-Marking===
In some languages, animate entities are marked explicitly, while inanimate entities remain unmarked.

===Morpheme Order===
The arrangement of morphemes within a word or phrase can reflect animacy distinctions.

===Complex Techniques===
These involve multiple processes, such as combining morphological and phonological strategies, to mark animacy distinctions.

===Morphophonemic Techniques===
Phonological changes such as vowel alternation, nasalization, tone, stress, and glottalization are used to express animacy distinctions.

===Mixed Techniques===
These combine two or more of the above methods, such as blending morphological and morphophonemic strategies, to create more nuanced animacy markers.

==Examples==
The distinction between &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, and other personal pronouns, on one hand, and &quot;it&quot;, on the other hand is a distinction in animacy in English and in many Indo-European languages. The same can be said about distinction between &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot;. Some languages, such as Turkish, Georgian, Spoken Finnish and Italian, do not distinguish between &quot;s/he&quot; and &quot;it&quot;. In Finnish, there is a distinction in animacy between , &quot;he/she&quot;, and , &quot;it&quot;, but in Spoken Finnish &quot;&quot; can mean &quot;he/she&quot;. English shows a similar lack of distinction between &quot;they&quot; animate and &quot;they&quot; inanimate in the plural.

There is another example of how animacy plays some role in English. For example, the higher animacy a referent has, the less preferable it is to use the preposition &quot;of&quot; for possession (that can also be interpreted in terms of alienable or inalienable possession):
* &quot;My face&quot; is correct while &quot;the face of mine&quot; would sound strange.
* &quot;The man&#x27;s face&quot; and &quot;the face of the man&quot; are both correct, but the former is preferred.
* &quot;The clock&#x27;s face&quot; and &quot;the face of the clock&quot; are both correct.

Examples of languages in which an animacy hierarchy is important include the Totonac language in Mexico and the Southern Athabaskan languages (such as Western Apache and Navajo) whose animacy hierarchy has been the subject of intense study. The Tamil language has a noun classification based on animacy.

===Proto-Indo-European language===
Because of the similarities in morphology of feminine and masculine grammatical gender inflections in Indo-European languages, there is a theory that in an early stage, the Proto-Indo-European language had only two grammatical genders: &quot;animate&quot; and &quot;inanimate/neuter&quot;; the most obvious difference being that inanimate/neuter nouns used the same form for the nominative, vocative, and accusative noun cases. The distinction was preserved in Anatolian languages like Hittite, all of which are now extinct.

The animate gender would then later, after the separation of the Anatolian languages, have developed into the feminine and masculine genders. The plural of neuter/inanimate nouns is believed to have had the same ending as collective nouns in the singular, and some words with the collective noun ending in singular were later to become words with the feminine gender. Traces can be found in Ancient Greek in which the singular form of verbs was used when they referred to neuter words in plural. In many Indo-European languages, such as Latin and the Slavic languages, the plural ending of many neuter words in the merged nominative–accusative–vocative corresponds to the feminine singular nominative form.

===Navajo (Diné)===
Like most other Athabaskan languages, Southern Athabaskan languages show various levels of animacy in their grammar, with certain nouns taking specific verb forms according to their rank in this animacy hierarchy. For instance, Navajo (Diné) nouns can be ranked by animacy on a continuum from most animate (a human) to least animate (an abstraction) (Young &amp; Morgan 1987: 65–66):

: Adult human/lightning &gt; infant/big animal &gt; medium-sized animal &gt; small animal &gt; natural force &gt; abstraction

Generally, the most animate noun in a sentence must occur first while the noun with lesser animacy occurs second. If both nouns are equal in animacy, either noun can occur in the first position. Both sentences (1) and (2) are correct. The prefix on the verb indicates that the first noun is the subject and indicates that the second noun is the subject.

Sentence (3), however, sounds wrong to most Navajo speakers because the less animate noun occurs before the more animate noun:

In order to express that idea, the more animate noun must occur first, as in sentence (4):

There is evidence suggesting that the word order itself is not the important factor. Instead, the verb construction usually interpreted as the passive voice (e.g. &quot;the girl was pecked by the bird&quot;) instead indicates that the more animate noun allowed the less animate noun to perform the action (e.g. &quot;the girl let herself be pecked by the bird&quot;). The idea is that things ranked higher in animacy are presumed to be in control of the situation, and that the less-animate thing can only act if the more-animate thing permits it.

===Japanese===
Although nouns in Japanese are not marked for animacy, it has two existential/possessive verbs; one for implicitly animate nouns (usually humans and animals) and one for implicitly inanimate nouns (often non-living objects and plants). The verb &quot;iru&quot; (, also written ) is used to show the existence or possession of an animate noun. The verb &quot;aru&quot; (, sometimes written when existential or when possessive) is used to show the existence or possession of an inanimate noun.

An animate noun, here &#x27;cat&#x27;, is marked as the subject of the verb with the subject particle &quot;ga&quot; (), but no topic or location is marked. That implies the noun is indefinite and merely exists.

In the second example, a topic is introduced, in this case &quot;I&quot;, with the topic particle &quot;wa&quot; (). The animate noun is again marked with a subject particle, and no location is denoted. That implies that the topic owns or is holding onto the noun.

In the third example, the noun is marked as the topic (and by default functions as the subject of the verb) while a location, here the top of a chair, is marked with the location particle &quot;ni&quot; (). That implies that the noun is a definite noun and is at the specified location.

In all these cases, if the noun is not animate, such as a stone, instead of a cat, the verb &quot;iru&quot; must be replaced with the verb &quot;aru&quot; ( or [possessive] / [existential, locative]).



In some cases in which &quot;natural&quot; animacy is ambiguous, whether a noun is animate or not is the decision of the speaker, as in the case of a robot, which could be correlated with the animate verb (to signify sentience or anthropomorphism) or with the inanimate verb (to emphasise that is a non-living thing).

====Ryukyuan languages====
The Ryukyuan languages, spoken in the Ryukyu Islands agree in animacy in their case systems.

===Slavic languages===
====Overview====
Slavic languages that have case (all of them except Bulgarian and Macedonian) have a somewhat complex hierarchy of animacy in which syntactically animate nouns may include both animate and inanimate objects (like mushrooms and dances). Overall, the border between animate and inanimate places humans and animals in the former and plants, etc., in the latter, thus basing itself more so on sentience than life.

Animacy functions as a subgender through which noun cases intersect in a phenomenon called syncretism, which here can be either nominative-accusative or genitive-accusative. Inanimate nouns have accusative forms that take on the same forms as their nominative, with animate nouns marked by having their accusative forms resemble the genitive.

For example, syncretism in Polish conditioned by referential animacy results in forms like the following:

* NOM &quot;stół&quot; &#x27;table&#x27; -&gt; ACC stół, like nom -&gt; GEN stołu (exhibiting nom-acc syncretism);
* NOM &quot;kot&quot; &#x27;cat&#x27; -&gt; ACC kota, like gen -&gt; GEN kota (exhibiting gen-acc syncretism).

That syncretism also occurs when restricted by declension class, resulting in syncretism in multiple pronominal forms, such as the Russian reflexive pronoun (), personal pronouns, and the indefinite interrogative and relative pronoun &quot;kto&quot;.

In their plural forms, nouns of all genders may distinguish the categories of animate vs. inanimate by that syncretism, but only masculine nouns of the first declension (and their modifiers) show it in the singular (Frarie 1992:12), and other declensions and genders of nouns &quot;restrict (morphological) expression of animacy to the plural&quot; (Frarie 1992:47).
* Masc nouns that show acc-gen (sg &amp; plural) syncretism: [muʂ] husband, [sɨn] son, [lʲef] lion, [konʲ] horse.
* Fem animate nouns that show acc-gen (plural) syncretism: [ˈʐɛnʲɕːɪnə] woman, [ˈɫoʂətʲ] horse.
* Neut animate nouns that show acc-nom (sg) and acc-gen (plural) syncretism: &#x27;animal&#x27;, &#x27;insect&#x27;.
Elsewhere, animacy is displayed syntactically, such as in endings of modifiers for masc nouns of the second declension.

====Animacy as a &quot;subgender&quot;====
While animacy is viewed as primarily semantic when approached diachronically, a synchronic view suggests animacy as a sublevel of gender. Syntactic gender is defined through patterns in agreement, not necessarily semantic value. For example, Russian has &quot;common gender&quot; nouns that refer to traditionally masculine roles but act as syntactically feminine.

Animacy occurs as a subgender of nouns and modifiers (and pronouns only when adjectival) and is primarily reflected in modifier-head agreement (as opposed to subject-predicate agreement).

====Controversy====
Some consider the system to be based on marking inanimacy in which case the gen-acc distinguishes a &quot;non-inanimate&quot; subgender of nouns and modifiers, and others claim that ultimately it is indeed animacy that is marked.

===Sinhala===
In spoken Sinhala, there are two existential/possessive verbs: &quot;hiţinawā&quot; / &quot;innawā&quot; are used only for animate nouns (humans and animals), and තියෙනවා &quot;tiyenawā&quot; for inanimate nouns (like non-living objects, plants, things):

=== Spanish ===
====Nouns====
In Spanish, the preposition (meaning &quot;to&quot; or &quot;at&quot;) has gained a second role as a marker of concrete animate direct objects:

The usage is standard and is found around the Spanish-speaking world.

====Pronouns====
Spanish personal pronouns are generally omitted if the subject of the sentence is obvious, but when they are explicitly stated, they are used only with people or humanized animals or things. The inanimate subject pronoun in Spanish is , like &quot;it&quot; in English (except &quot;ello&quot; can only be used to refer to verbs and clauses, not objects, as all nouns are either masculine or feminine and are referred to with the appropriate pronouns).

Spanish direct-object pronouns () do not differentiate between animate and inanimate entities, and only the third persons have a gender distinction. Thus, for example, the third-person singular feminine pronoun, , could refer to a woman, an animal (like , butterfly), or an object (like , house), if their genders are feminine.

In certain dialects, there is a tendency to use (which is usually an indirect object pronoun, meaning &quot;to him/her&quot;) as a direct-object pronoun, at the expense of the direct-object pronouns , if the referent is animate. That tendency is especially strong if (a) the pronoun is being used as a special second-person pronoun of respect, (b) the referent is male, (c) certain verbs are used, (d) the subject of the verb happens to be inanimate.

===Arabic===
In Classical and Modern Standard Arabic and some other varieties of Arabic, animacy has a limited application in the agreement of plural and dual nouns with verbs and adjectives. Verbs follow nouns in plural agreement only when the verb comes after the subject. When a verb comes before an explicit subject, the verb is always singular. Also, only animate plural and dual nouns take plural agreement; inanimate plural nouns are always analyzed as singular feminine or plural feminine for the purpose of agreement. Thus, Arabic (&quot;Al-muhandisūn yaṭīrūn ’ilā ’Almāniyā&quot;, &quot;The engineers fly to Germany&quot;) is masculine plural agreement, but (&quot;Al-ṭā’irāt taṭīr ’ilā ’Almāniyā&quot;, &quot;The planes fly to Germany&quot;) is feminine singular. Compare them to (&quot;Taṭīr al-muhandisāt ’ilā ’Almāniyā&quot;) and (&quot;Al-muhandisāt yaṭirna ’ilā ’Almāniyā&quot;) for &quot;The [female] engineers fly to Germany.&quot;

In general, Arabic divides animacy between (thinking, or rational) and (unthinking, or irrational). Animals fall in the latter category, but their status may change depending on the usage, especially with personification. Different writers might use (&quot;Al-ġurbān yaṭīrūn ’ilā ’Almāniyā&quot;) or (&quot;Al-ġurbān taṭīr ’ilā ’Almāniyā&quot;) for &quot;The ravens fly to Germany.&quot;

==Animacy hierarchy and morphosyntactic alignment==

===Split ergativity===
Animacy can also condition the nature of the morphologies of split-ergative languages. In such languages, participants more animate are more likely to be the agent of the verb, and therefore are marked in an accusative pattern: unmarked in the agent role and marked in the patient or oblique role.

Likewise, less animate participants are inherently more patient-like, and take ergative marking: unmarked when in the patient role and marked when in the agent role. The hierarchy of animacy generally, but not always, is ordered:
The location of the split (the line which divides the inherently agentive participants from the inherently patientive participants) varies from language to language, and, in many cases, the two classes overlap, with a class of nouns near the middle of the hierarchy being marked for both the agent and patient roles.

===Hierarchical alignment===
In a direct–inverse language, clauses with transitive verbs can be expressed with either a direct or an inverse construction. The direct construction is used when the subject of the transitive clause outranks the object in salience or animacy. The inverse construction is used when the &quot;notional object&quot; outranks the &quot;notional subject&quot;.

===Thematic roles===
A noun essentially requires the traits of animacy in order to receive the role of Actor and Experiencer. Additionally, the Agent role is generally assigned to the NP with highest ranking in the animacy hierarchy – ultimately, only animate beings can function as true agents. Similarly, languages universally tend to place animate nouns earlier in the sentence than inanimate nouns.
Animacy is a key component of agency – combined with other factors like &quot;awareness of action&quot;. Agency and animacy are intrinsically linked – with each as a &quot;conceptual property&quot; of the other.

<text>The Salishan (also Salish ) languages are a family of languages of the Pacific Northwest in North America (the Canadian province of British Columbia and the American states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana). They are characterised by agglutinativity and syllabic consonants. For instance the Nuxalk word (), meaning &quot;he had had [in his possession] a bunchberry plant&quot;, has twelve obstruent consonants in a row with no phonetic or phonemic vowels.

The Salishan languages are a geographically contiguous block, with the exception of the Nuxalk (Bella Coola), in the Central Coast of British Columbia, and the extinct Tillamook language, to the south on the central coast of Oregon.

The terms &quot;Salish&quot; and &quot;Salishan&quot; are used interchangeably by linguists and anthropologists studying Salishan, but this is confusing in regular English usage. The name &quot;Salish&quot; or &quot;Selisch&quot; is the endonym of the Flathead Nation. Linguists later applied the name Salish to related languages in the Pacific Northwest. Many of the peoples do not have self-designations (autonyms) in their languages; they frequently have specific names for local dialects, as the local group was more important culturally than larger tribal relations.

All Salishan languages are considered critically endangered, some extremely so, with only three or four speakers left. Those languages considered extinct are often referred to as &quot;dormant languages&quot;, in that no speakers exist currently, but still serve as a symbol of ethnic identity to an ethnic group. In the early 21st century, few Salish languages have more than 2,000 speakers. Fluent, daily speakers of almost all Salishan languages are generally over sixty years of age; many languages have only speakers over eighty.

Salishan languages are most commonly written using the Americanist phonetic notation to account for the various vowels and consonants that do not exist in most modern alphabets. Many groups have evolved their own distinctive uses of the Latin alphabet, however, such as the Saanich.

== Family division ==
The Salishan language family consists of twenty-three languages. The family is typically organized into two main divisions with variation: Coast Salish (Coast Division), Interior Salish (Interior Division), Tillamook, and Nuxalk. Nuxalk is sometimes classified as part of the Coastal Division of languages. Tillamook is also sometimes classfied as part of the Coast Division. It was proposed by Morris Swadesh that the Olympic branch of Coast Salishan languages is a natural subdivision within the family, although linguists today generally accept the Olympic branch as a subgrouping within the Coast Salish division. The Interior Salish languages have a higher degree of closeness to each other than the more distant Coast Salish languages.

=== Language tree ===
Below is a list of Salishan languages, dialects, and subdialects. The genetic unity among the Salish languages is evident. Neighboring groups have communicated often, to the point that it is difficult to untangle the influence each dialect and language has upon others. This list is a linguistic classification that may not correspond to political divisions. In contrast to classifications made by linguistic scholars, many Salishan groups consider their particular variety of speech to be a separate language rather than a dialect.

Languages or dialects with no living native speakers are marked with at the highest level.

==== Detailed overview ====
== Genetic relations ==
No relationship to any other language family is well established.

Edward Sapir suggested that the Salishan languages might be related to the Wakashan and Chimakuan languages in a hypothetical Mosan family. This proposal persists primarily through Sapir&#x27;s stature: with little evidence for such a family, no progress has been made in reconstructing it.

The Salishan languages, principally Chehalis, contributed greatly to the vocabulary of the Chinook Jargon.

== Family features ==

* Post-velar harmony (more areal)
* Presence of syllables without vowels
* Grammatical reduplication
* Nonconcatenation (infixes, metathesis, glottalization)
* Tenselessness
* Nounlessness (controversial)

== Syntax ==
The syntax of Salish languages is notable for its word order (verb-initial), its valency-marking, and the use of several forms of negation.

=== Word order ===
Although there is a wide array of Salish languages, they all share some basic traits. All are verb initial languages, with VSO (verb-subject-object) being the most common word order. Some Salishan languages allow for VOS and SVO as well. There is no case marking, but central noun phrases will often be preceded by determiners while non-central NPs will take prepositions. Some Salishan languages are ergative, or split-ergative, and many take unique object agreement forms in passive statements. In the St&#x27;át&#x27;imcets (Lillooet Salish) language, for example, absolutive relative clauses (including a head, like &quot;the beans&quot;, and a restricting clause, like &quot;that she re-fried&quot;, which references the head) omit person markers, while ergative relative clauses keep person makers on the subject, and sometimes use the topic morpheme &quot;-tali&quot;. Thus, St&#x27;át&#x27;imcets is split-ergative, as it is not ergative all the time. Subject and object pronouns usually take the form of affixes that attach to the verb. All Salish languages are head-marking. Possession is marked on the possessed noun phrase as either a prefix or a suffix, while person is marked on predicates. In Central Salish languages like Tillamook and Shuswap, only one plain NP is permitted aside from the subject.

=== Valency-marking ===

Salishan languages are known for their polysynthetic nature. A verb stem will often have at least one affix, which is typically a suffix. These suffixes perform a variety of functions, such as transitive, causative, reciprocal, reflexive, and applicative. Applicative affixes seem to be present on the verb when the direct object is central to the event being discussed, but is not the theme of the sentence. The direct object may be a recipient, for example. It may also refer to a related noun phrase, like the goal a verb intends to achieve, or the instrument used in carrying out the action of the verb. In the sentence ‘The man used the axe to chop the log with.’, the axe is the instrument and is indicated in Salish through an applicative affix on the verb.

Applicative affixes increase the number of affixes a verb can take on, that is, its syntactic valence. They are also known as &quot;transitivizers&quot; because they can change a verb from intransitive to transitive. For example, in the sentence &#x27;I got scared.&#x27;, &#x27;scared&#x27; is intransitive. However, with the addition of an applicative affix, which is syntactically transitive, the verb in Salish becomes transitive and the sentence can come to mean ‘I got scared of you.’. In some Salishan languages, such as Sḵwx̲wú7mesh, the transitive forms of verbs are morphologically distinctive and marked with a suffix, while the intransitive forms are not. In others such as Halkomelem, intransitive forms have a suffix as well. In some Salish languages, transitivizers can be either controlled (the subject conducted the action on purpose) or limited-control (the subject did not intend to conduct the action, or only managed to conduct a difficult action).

These transitivizers can be followed by object suffixes, which come to modern Salishan languages via Proto-Salish. Proto-Salish had two types of object suffixes, neutral (regular transitive) and causative (when a verb causes the object to do something or be in a certain state), that were then divided into first, second, and third persons, and either singular or plural. Tentative reconstructions of these suffixes include the neutral singular *-c (1st person), *-ci (2nd person), and *-∅ (3rd person), the causative singular *-mx (1st), *-mi (2nd), and *-∅ (3rd), the neutral plural *-al or *-muɬ (1st), *-ulm or *-muɬ (2nd), and the causative plural *-muɬ (1st and 2nd). In Salishan languages spoken since Proto-Salish, the forms of those suffixes have been subject to vowel shifts, borrowing pronoun forms from other languages (such as Kutenai), and merging of neutral and causative forms (as in Secwepemc, Nlaka&#x27;pamuctsin, Twana, Straits Salishan languages, and Halkomelem).

=== Three patterns of negation ===
There are three general patterns of negation among the Salishan languages. The most common pattern involves a negative predicate in the form of an impersonal and intransitive stative verb, which occurs in sentence initial position. The second pattern involves a sentence initial negative particle that is often attached to the sentence&#x27;s subject, and the last pattern simply involves a sentence initial negative particle without any change in inflectional morphology or a determiner/complementizer. In addition, there is a fourth restricted pattern that has been noted only in Squamish.

== Nounlessness ==
Salishan languages (along with the Wakashan and the extinct Chimakuan languages) exhibit predicate/argument flexibility. All content words are able to occur as the head of the predicate (including words with typically &#x27;noun-like&#x27; meanings that refer to entities) or in an argument (including those with &#x27;verb-like&#x27; meanings that refer to events). Words with noun-like meanings are automatically equivalent to [be + NOUN] when used predicatively, such as Lushootseed which means &#x27;(is a) coyote&#x27;. Words with more verb-like meanings, when used as arguments, are equivalent to [one that VERBs] or [VERB+er]. For example, Lushootseed means &#x27;(one that) goes&#x27;.

The following examples are from Lushootseed.

An almost identical pair of sentences from St’át’imcets demonstrates that this phenomenon is not restricted to Lushootseed.

This and similar behaviour in other Salish and Wakashan languages has been used as evidence for a complete lack of a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs in these families. This has become controversial in recent years. David Beck of the University of Alberta contends that there is evidence for distinct lexical categories of &#x27;noun&#x27; and &#x27;verb&#x27; by arguing that, although any distinction is neutralised in predicative positions, words that can be categorised as &#x27;verbs&#x27; are marked when used in syntactic argument positions. He argues that Salishan languages are omnipredicative, but only have &#x27;uni-directional flexibility&#x27; (not &#x27;bi-directional flexibility&#x27;), which makes Salishan languages no different from other omnipredicative languages such as Arabic and Nahuatl, which have a clear lexical noun-verb distinction.

Beck does concede, however, that the Lushootseed argument (&#x27;the one who goes&#x27;, shown in example sentence (1b) above) does represent an example of an unmarked &#x27;verb&#x27; used as an argument and that further research may potentially substantiate Dale Kinkade&#x27;s 1983 position that all Salishan content words are essentially &#x27;verbs&#x27; (such as &#x27;goes&#x27; and &#x27;is a coyote&#x27;) and that the use of any content word as an argument involves an underlying relative clause. For example, with the determiner translated as &#x27;that which&#x27;, the arguments and would be most literally translated as &#x27;that which goes&#x27; and &#x27;that which is a coyote&#x27; respectively.

== Historical linguistics ==

There are twenty-three languages in the Salishan language family. They occupy the Pacific Northwest, with all but two of them being concentrated together in a single large area. It is clear that these languages are related, but it&#x27;s difficult to track the development of each because their histories are so interwoven. The different speech communities have interacted a great deal, making it nearly impossible to decipher the influences of varying dialects and languages on one another. However, there are several trends and patterns that can be historically traced to generalize the development of the Salishan languages over the years.

The variation between the Salishan languages seems to depend on two main factors: the distance between speech communities and the geographic barriers between them. The diversity between the languages corresponds directly to the distance between them. Closer proximity often entails more contact between speakers, and more linguistic similarities are the result. Geographic barriers like mountains impede contact, so two communities that are relatively close together may still vary considerably in their language use if there is a mountain separating them.

The rate of change between neighboring Salishan languages often depends on their environments. If for some reason two communities diverge, their adaptation to a new environment can separate them linguistically from each other. The need to create names for tools, animals, and plants creates an array of new vocabulary that divides speech communities. However, these new names may come from borrowing from neighboring languages, in which case two languages or dialects can grow more alike rather than apart. Interactions with outside influences through trade and intermarriage often result in language change as well.

Some cultural elements are more resilient to language change, namely, religion and folklore. Salishan language communities that have demonstrated change in technology and environmental vocabulary have often remained more consistent with their religious terminology. Religion and heavily ingrained cultural traditions are often regarded as sacred, and so are less likely to undergo any sort of change. Indeed, cognate lists between various Salishan languages show more similarities in religious terminology than they do in technology and environment vocabulary. Other categories with noticeable similarities include words for body parts, colors, and numbers. There would be little need to change such vocabulary, so it&#x27;s more likely to remain the same despite other changes between languages. The Coast Salishan languages are less similar to each other than are the Interior Salishan languages, probably because the Coast communities have more access to outside influences.

Another example of language change in the Salishan language family is word taboo, which is a cultural expression of the belief in the power of words. Among the Coast languages, a person&#x27;s name becomes a taboo word immediately following their death. This taboo is lifted when the name of the deceased is given to a new member of their lineage. In the meantime, the deceased person&#x27;s name and words that are phonetically similar to the name are considered taboo and can only be expressed via descriptive phrases. In some cases these taboo words are permanently replaced by their chosen descriptive phrases, resulting in language change.

== In popular culture ==
Stanley Evans has written a series of crime fiction novels that use Salish lore and language.

An episode of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (&quot;Spirits&quot;, 2x13) features a culture of extraterrestrial humans loosely inspired by Pacific coastal First Nations culture, and who speak a language referred to as &quot;ancient Salish&quot;.

In the video game &quot;Life Is Strange&quot;, the Salish lore was used on certain history of Arcadia Bay as totem poles are seen on some areas, including a segment from the first episode of its prequel involving the raven.

<doc id="222683" wikidata="Q751871" url="?curid=222683" title="Thermidor">
<text>Thermidor () was the eleventh month in the French Republican calendar. The month was named after the French word &quot;thermal&quot;, derived from the Greek word &quot;thermos&quot; &#x27;heat&#x27;.

Thermidor was the second month of the summer quarter (&quot;mois d&#x27;été&quot;). It started July 19 or 20. It ended August 17 or 18. It follows Messidor and precedes Fructidor. During Year 2, it was sometimes called Fervidor.

Because of the Thermidorian Reaction—9 Thermidor Year II—the overthrow of revolutionary radical Maximilien Robespierre and his followers in that month, the word &quot;Thermidor&quot; has come to mean a retreat from more radical goals and strategies during a revolution, especially when caused by a replacement of leading personalities. 


== Day name table ==
Like all French Republican Calendar months, Thermidor lasted 30 days and was divided into three 10-day weeks called &quot;décades&quot; (decades). Every day had the name of an agricultural plant, except the 5th (Quintidi) and 10th day (Decadi) of every decade, which had the name of a domestic animal or an agricultural tool, respectively.

== Conversion table ==

== Thermidor in revolution ==

The Thermidorian Reaction, Revolution of Thermidor, or simply Thermidor refers to the coup of 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794) in which the Committee of Public Safety led by Maximilien Robespierre was sidelined and its leaders arrested and guillotined, resulting in the end of the Reign of Terror. The new regime, known as The Directory, introduced more conservative policies aimed at stabilizing the revolutionary government.

Consequently, for historians of revolutionary movements, the term &quot;Thermidor&quot; has come to mean the phase in some revolutions when the political pendulum swings back towards something resembling a pre-revolutionary state, and power slips from the hands of the original revolutionary leadership. Leon Trotsky, in his book &quot;The Revolution Betrayed&quot;, refers to the rise of Joseph Stalin and the accompanying post-revolutionary bureaucracy as the &quot;Soviet Thermidor&quot;.

== Thermidor in culture ==

The food Lobster Thermidor was named, directly or indirectly, after the month. Sometimes it is said that it was first prepared for Napoleon I during the month of Thermidor. Others say that it was created by Tony Girod at the &quot;Café de Paris&quot;, to celebrate the opening of a play called &quot;Thermidor&quot;.

Thermidor is the name of a story revolving around the end of the French Revolution in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot;, issue #29.

There is a song recorded by J-pop artist Nana Mizuki by the name of &quot;Thermidor&quot;. Its lyrics talk about a person in love that is also rethinking their personal feelings after realizing that the person they love has changed, and so has the person. Its lyrics mimic the modern definition of Thermidor.

<doc id="222684" wikidata="Q440837" url="?curid=222684" title="Andrés Rodríguez (politician)">
<text>Andrés Rodríguez Pedotti (June 19, 1923 – April 21, 1997) was a military officer and politician, being President of Paraguay from February 3, 1989, to August 15, 1993. He led the coup d&#x27;état on February 2 and 3, 1989, against the dictator Alfredo Stroessner Matiauda.

==1989 coup d&#x27;état==

Rodríguez had been Alfredo Stroessner&#x27;s closest confidant for 35 years. The two became so close that Rodríguez&#x27; daughter married Stroessner&#x27;s elder son. Under Stroessner&#x27;s rule, Rodríguez became one of the richest men in Paraguay. Despite only earning the equivalent of $500 per month, he owned the nation&#x27;s largest brewery, a chain of currency exchanges, an import-export company, a copper wire company, and several ranches.

However, relations between the two grew increasingly strained in the late 1980s. As the decade wore on, Rodríguez cultivated ties with the &quot;traditionalists&quot; in the long-dominant Colorado Party. This element of the party had supported Stroessner throughout his three-decade rule, but had come to favor a more humane way of governing. Matters came to a head in January 1989, when Stroessner relieved several generals of their commands and replaced them with men thought to be unquestionably loyal to him. Later that month, in what was viewed as a direct strike at Rodríguez, Stroessner closed all of the country&#x27;s currency exchanges. On February 2, Stroessner summoned his former ally and gave him an ultimatum—either accept appointment as defense minister (which would have effectively been a demotion) or retire. It was reported that Rodríguez avoided the reunion (and attempted to quell rumors of him planning a coup) by faking a leg injury, going as far as having a fake cast put on one of his legs.

Rodríguez gave his answer on the night of February 2 when he launched a violent coup. Rebel troops and tanks surrounded the headquarters of the Presidential Guard in Asunción (where Stroessner had sought refuge). The coup had the backing of much of the Roman Catholic Church and of the United States, who no longer required Stroessner as an ally in the Cold War. With this support, the coup quickly succeeded, with Stroessner resigning only hours after hostilities began. However, some 500 soldiers on both sides are believed to have died as a consequence of Stroessner&#x27;s capture. He was released and fled into exile a few days later, eventually taking refuge in Brazil.

A couple of weeks following the coup, former interior minister Edgar Ynsfrán told reporters that Rodríguez had begun planning the coup toward the end of December 1988. Ynsfrán had served as interior minister during the most repressive phase of the &quot;Stronato,&quot; but had switched to supporting Rodríguez and now favored a more humane approach to governance.

==Presidency==
At the time, Paraguay did not have a vice president. Per the Constitution, if a president died, resigned, or became permanently disabled, a provisional president was to be chosen by Congress and the Council of State within 24 hours. Accordingly, Congress and the Council of State met soon after the coup and designated Rodríguez as provisional president.

Upon taking office, Rodríguez canceled most of Stroessner&#x27;s most repressive measures, which came as a surprise given his previous closeness to Stroessner. He abolished the death penalty, freed political prisoners, and tried to imprison some leading members of the Stroessner government. He formally canceled the state of siege that had been in place for virtually all of Stroessner&#x27;s rule; while it had nominally been repealed in 1987, its substance had remained in place in the form of draconian security laws and close restrictions on press freedom (opposition leaders had been arrested, and the Colorados had been the only party that had been allowed to campaign unmolested in the 1988 elections). He also welcomed back several longtime exiles.

Over the course of the following week, the military was purged of Stroessner&#x27;s loyalists, and the commanders of the six rebellious army divisions were promoted to replace them.

As provisional president, Rodríguez dissolved the Chamber of Deputies on February 9 under a provision in the 1967 constitution that allowed the president to dissolve the legislature if he felt it had acted in a manner that distorted the constitutional separation of powers. He issued a decree setting new elections in May, and announced that all non-Communist parties would be allowed to compete. He intended to use this as a tool to purge the militants. This was a remarkable turn in a country where the opposition had been barely tolerated for much of its history, particularly during Stroessner&#x27;s rule. Indeed, at the time of the coup, the country had only known two years of pluralism in its entire history. A presidential election for the balance of Stroessner&#x27;s term was also on the same day as the congressional elections. The constitution required new elections within 90 days of a president resigning less than two years into his term, with the winner serving the unexpired portion of the term. Rodríguez ran as the Colorado candidate and was elected with 76 percent of the vote in what was the closest thing the country had seen to a free and fair election up to that time.

Soon after the ouster of Stroessner, the Rodríguez government was contacted by representatives of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, inviting Paraguay to end its long-standing diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) and to recognize PRC instead. However, Rodríguez accepted the arguments of the Taiwanese ambassador Wang Sheng that continuing the relationship with ROC, and thus keeping Taiwan&#x27;s development assistance and access to Taiwan&#x27;s markets, would be more advantageous for Paraguay.

==End of rule and death==
On June 20, 1992, Paraguay adopted a new constitution. It limited the president to a single five-year term, with no possibility of reelection. The ban on reelection retroactively applied to Rodríguez, even though he had promised that he would not run for a full term. Rodríguez called this provision evidence of a lack of confidence in his word, and boycotted the inauguration ceremony. Fears of a coup were only allayed when he signed the new constitution into law on June 22. He stepped down as president on August 15, 1993, the first Paraguayan president in decades to leave office at the end of his term. He was succeeded by Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who like Rodríguez was a member of the Colorado Party.

Rodríguez died in New York City in 1997 after a long battle with cancer.

<text>Dilithium, Li2, is a strongly electrophilic, diatomic molecule comprising two lithium atoms covalently bonded together. Li2 has been observed in the gas phase. 
It has a bond order of 1, an internuclear separation of 267.3 pm and a bond energy of 102 kJ/mol or 1.06 eV in each bond. 
The electron configuration of Li2 may be written as σ2.

Being the third-lightest stable neutral homonuclear diatomic molecule (after dihydrogen and dihelium), dilithium is an extremely important model system for studying fundamentals of physics, chemistry, and electronic structure theory.

It is the most thoroughly characterized compound in terms of the accuracy and completeness of the empirical potential energy curves of its electronic states. Analytic empirical potential energy curves have been constructed for the X-state, a-state, A-state, c-state, B-state, 2d-state, l-state, E-state, and the F-state. The most reliable of these potential energy curves are of the Morse/Long-range variety (see entries in the table below).

Li2 potentials are often used to extract atomic properties. For example, the C3 value for atomic lithium extracted from the A-state potential of Li2 by Le Roy et al. in is more precise than any previously measured atomic oscillator strength. 
This lithium oscillator strength is related to the radiative lifetime of atomic lithium and is used as a benchmark for atomic clocks and measurements of fundamental constants.

<text>Dan Georgakas (; March 1, 1938 – November 23, 2021) was an American anarchist poet and historian, who specialized in oral history and the American labor movement, best known for the publication &quot;Detroit: I do mind dying: A study in urban revolution&quot; (1975), which documents African-American radical groups in Detroit during the 1960s and 1970s.

== Early life ==

Dan Georgakas was born March 1, 1938, to Xenophon and Sophia Georgakas in Detroit, Michigan.

==Career==

In 1966, Georgakas and painter Ben Morea helped found the Anarchist group Up Against the Wall Motherfucker affiliated with New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side.

In 1967, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest,&quot; initiated by an editor of the &quot;New York Times&quot; Magazine. Inspired by the civil disobedience of Henry David Thoreau, the manifesto united 528 American writers and publishers who refused to pay the 10% tax for the Vietnam War.

In 1975, Georgakas co-published with Marvin Surkin &quot;Detroit: I do mind dying: a study in urban revolution&quot;. The book traces workers&#x27; struggles of the 1970s in the car factories. It highlights: conditions of line work, corruption of union apparatus, daily racism in American society.

In the late 1980s, Georgakas began co-writing the &quot;Encyclopedia of the American Left&quot; (1990, 1998) with Mari Jo Buhle and husband Paul Buhle.

Georgakas had spoken at annual seminars for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).

Georgakas had long served on the editorial board of &quot;Cineaste magazine&quot; and specializes in Latin American cinema.

Georgakas had taught at New York University, Columbia University, the University of Oklahoma, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Queens College.

<text>Xiaolin Wu&#x27;s line algorithm is an algorithm for line antialiasing.
==Antialiasing technique==
Xiaolin Wu&#x27;s line algorithm was presented in the article &quot;An Efficient Antialiasing Technique&quot; in the July 1991 issue of &quot;Computer Graphics&quot;, as well as in the article &quot;Fast Antialiasing&quot; in the June 1992 issue of &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;.

Bresenham&#x27;s algorithm draws lines extremely quickly, but it does not perform anti-aliasing. In addition, it cannot handle any cases where the line endpoints do not lie exactly on integer points of the pixel grid. A naive approach to anti-aliasing the line would take an extremely long time. Wu&#x27;s algorithm is comparatively fast, but is still slower than Bresenham&#x27;s algorithm. The algorithm consists of drawing pairs of pixels straddling the line, each coloured according to its distance from the line. Pixels at the line ends are handled separately. Lines less than one pixel long are handled as a special case.

An extension to the algorithm for circle drawing was presented by Xiaolin Wu in the book &quot;Graphics Gems II&quot;. Just as the line drawing algorithm is a replacement for Bresenham&#x27;s line drawing algorithm, the circle drawing algorithm is a replacement for Bresenham&#x27;s circle drawing algorithm.

<text>Gatorade is an American brand of sports-themed beverage and food products, built around its signature line of sports drinks. The drink is manufactured by PepsiCo and is distributed in over 80 countries. The beverage was developed in 1965 by a team of researchers at the University of Florida led by Robert Cade. It was originally made for the school&#x27;s student-athletes, the Gators, to replenish the carbohydrates that they burned and the combination of water and electrolytes that they lost in sweat during vigorous sports activities. Stokely-Van Camp acquired the rights to produce and market the Gatorade brand in 1965 before the company was purchased by the Quaker Oats Company in 1983, which, in turn, was bought by PepsiCo in 2001.

, Gatorade is PepsiCo&#x27;s fourth-largest brand, on the basis of worldwide annual retail sales. It competes with Coca-Cola&#x27;s Powerade and Vitaminwater brands worldwide, and with Lucozade in the United Kingdom. Within the United States, Gatorade accounts for approximately 67.7% of market share in the sports drink category. It is one of the 5 divisions represented in PepsiCo&#x27;s logo, alongside Frito-Lay, Pepsi, Tropicana, and Quaker.

==History==
Gatorade was created in 1965, by a team of scientists at the University of Florida College of Medicine, including Robert Cade, Dana Shires, Harry James Free, and Alejandro de Quesada. Following a request from Florida Gators football head coach Ray Graves, Gatorade was created to help athletes by acting as a replacement for body fluids lost during physical exertion. Like many of the sports drinks that pre-dated it by decades, such as Lucozade, the earliest version of the beverage consisted of a mixture of water, sodium, sugar, potassium, phosphate, and lemon juice. Ten players on the University of Florida football team tested the first version of Gatorade during practices and games in 1965, and the tests were deemed successful. On the other hand, star quarterback Steve Spurrier said, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any answer for whether the Gatorade helped us be a better second-half team or not... We drank it, but whether it helped us in the second half, who knows?&quot; Nonetheless, the football team credited Gatorade as having contributed to their first Orange Bowl win over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in 1967, at which point the drink gained traction within the athletic community. Yellow Jackets coach Bobby Dodd, when asked why his team lost, replied: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have Gatorade. That made the difference.&quot;

The University of Florida researchers initially considered naming their product &quot;Gator-Aid&quot;, but eventually settled on &quot;Gatorade&quot;. Darren Rovell notes in his history of Gatorade, &quot;First in Thirst&quot;, &quot;the doctors realized that they probably shouldn&#x27;t use the &#x27;Aid&#x27; suffix, since that would mean that if the drink were ever marketed, they would have to prove that it had a clear medicinal use and perform clinical tests on thousands of people.&quot; Gatorade co-inventor Dana Shires explained, &quot;We were told that you couldn&#x27;t use that because the Food and Drug Administration prohibited that. That would classify it as something other than a cola or soft drink, so we changed it to ade.&quot;

Some were skeptical that the product&#x27;s effect was anything more than a placebo. Cade mentioned, &quot;If you told a football player that you were giving him Demerol to relieve pain and you gave him a placebo instead, there&#x27;s about a 30% chance that the placebo will relieve the pain as much as taking Demerol would have.&quot;

Shortly after the 1969 Orange Bowl, Robert Cade entered into an agreement providing Stokely-Van Camp, Inc. (S-VC), a canned-food packaging company, with the U.S. rights to production and sale of Gatorade as a commercial product. In the same year, a licensing arrangement made Gatorade the official sports drink of the National Football League (NFL), representing the first in a history of professional sports sponsorship for the Gatorade brand. A year after its commercial introduction, S-VC tested multiple variations of the original Gatorade recipe, finally settling on more palatable variants in lemon-lime and orange flavors. This reformulation also removed the sweetener cyclamatewhich was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1969replacing it with additional fructose. In the early 1970s, legal questions arose regarding whether or not the researchers who invented Gatorade were entitled to ownership of its royalties since they had been working under a research grant from the federal government which provided financial stipends. The University of Florida also claimed partial rights of ownership, which was brought to resolution in 1973 in the form of a settlement awarding the university with a 20% share of Gatorade royalties. As of 2009, the university had received more than $150 million from its share and was receiving approximately $12 million per year.

The Quaker Oats Company purchased S-VC and Gatorade in 1983 for $220 million, following a bidding war with rival Pillsbury. In its first two decades of production, Gatorade was primarily sold and distributed within the United States. Beginning in the 1980s, the company expanded distribution of Gatorade, venturing into Canada in 1986, regions of Asia in 1987, South America and parts of Europe in 1988, and Australia in 1993. In 1990, Gatorade introduced Gatorade Light, a lower-calorie version sweetened with saccharin. International expansion came at the cost of $20 million in 1996 alone; however, the resulting efforts produced worldwide sales of $283 million in more than 45 countries during the same year. In 1997, distribution of Gatorade in an additional 10 countries prompted an 18.7% growth in annual sales.

In 2001, the multinational food and beverage company PepsiCo acquired Gatorade&#x27;s parent company, the Quaker Oats Company, for $13 billion to add Gatorade to its portfolio of brands. PepsiCo had also recently developed All Sport, which it divested of shortly following the Quaker acquisition to satisfy antitrust regulations. Worldwide development of Gatorade continued into the 2000s, including expansion into India in 2004, and the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2008. As of 2010, Gatorade products were made available for sale in more than 80 countries. As the number-one sports drink by annual retail sales in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, Gatorade is also among the leading sports drink brands in Korea and Australia.
As the distribution of Gatorade expanded outside of the U.S., localized flavors were introduced to conform to regional tastes and cultural preferences, among other factors. For example, Blueberry is available in Colombia, and in Brazil, a Pineapple flavor of Gatorade is sold. In Australia, flavors include Antarctic Freeze and Wild Water Rush. Some flavors that have been discontinued in the U.S., such as Alpine Snow and Starfruit, have since been made available in other countries.

In 2011, Gatorade was re-introduced to New Zealand by Bluebird Foods, a PepsiCo subsidiary in New Zealand. The product is made in Australia by Schweppes Australia, and exported to New Zealand and distributed along with Bluebird potato chips.

In September 2022, Gatorade introduced Fast Twitch, its first caffeinated energy drink that had 200 milligrams of caffeine, electrolytes, vitamins B6 and B12 but contained no sugar or carbonation. The company said it was designed to be taken in before a regular beverage consumed for hydration. It was an example of a broader push by PepsiCo into energy beverages.

==Products==
In its early years, the Gatorade brand consisted of a single product line, Gatorade Thirst Quencher, which was produced in liquid and powder form under two flavor variants: &quot;Lemon Lime&quot; and &quot;Orange&quot;. These remained as the only two flavor options for nearly 20 years, until the addition of the &quot;fruit punch&quot; flavor in 1983. In 1988, a &quot;Citrus Cooler&quot; flavor was introduced. The rise to popularity of this flavor was largely a result of Michael Jordan, who, at the height of his NBA career in the early 1990s, stated that it was his favorite flavor. This claim appeared on the packaging beginning in 1991, as part of a 10-year endorsement deal. The Citrus Cooler flavor was reportedly discontinued at some point in the 1990s; however, even as late as 2011, it was listed as being a current product in the U.S. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, as well as the late 1990s to early 2000s, a Gatorade brand of chewing gum called Gator Gum was produced. The product, manufactured by Fleer Corporation, was available in both of Gatorade&#x27;s original flavors (lemon-lime and orange). In the late 1970s, Stokely-Van Camp (owner of Gatorade before 1983) negotiated a long-term licensing deal with Swell and Vicks to market Gator Gum. The gum was discontinued in 1989 after the contract expired.

It was not until the mid and late 1990s that Gatorade beverages became available in a broader range of flavor variations. Among these initial flavor extensions were &quot;Watermelon&quot;, introduced in 1995, and &quot;Cherry Rush&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Kiwi&quot;, and &quot;Mandarina&quot; flavors, added in 1996. In January 1997, Gatorade launched a new sub-line called Gatorade Frost with the intent of broadening the brand&#x27;s appeal beyond traditional team competitive sports. Three initial flavors under the Frost product line were introduced at this time: &quot;Alpine Snow&quot;, &quot;Glacier Freeze&quot;, and &quot;Whitewater Splash&quot;. Aimed at what the company described as the &#x27;active thirst&#x27; categorya market ten times the size of the sports drink segmentGatorade Frost proved to be successful, far surpassing the company&#x27;s initial expectations. Flavors in the Frost line were the first from Gatorade to divert from fruit names; it was described as consisting of &quot;light-tasting fruit-flavor blends&quot;.

Gatorade revealed the Gatorade Energy Bar in 2001. This bar was Gatorade&#x27;s first foray into solid foods and was introduced to compete with PowerBar and Clif Bar. Gatorade Energy Bars contained a large proportion of protein, in addition to carbohydrates. The bar was primarily made up of puffed grains and corn syrup, common components of other energy bars. In 2001, Gatorade introduced the Gatorade Performance Series, a special line of sports nutrition products. These products include &quot;Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Drink&quot;, &quot;Gatorade Protein Recovery Shake&quot;, the &quot;Gatorade Nutrition Shake&quot;, and the &quot;Gatorade Nutrition Bar&quot;. The &quot;Endurance Formula&quot;, introduced in 2004, contained twice the sodium and three times the potassium of the typical Gatorade formula as well as chloride, magnesium, and calcium, to better replace what athletes lose while training and competing.

Introduced in 2002, Gatorade Ice was marketed as a lighter flavored Gatorade and came in Strawberry, Lime, Orange, and Watermelon. All of these flavors were colorless and transparent. Ice was re-branded in 2006 as Gatorade Rain and the flavor selections altered. In late 2007, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks, named G2, was released. G2 was meant for athletes off the field and those who practiced physical activities, such as yoga, at home. , G2 has been produced in eight flavors: &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Fruit Punch&quot;, &quot;Grape&quot;, &quot;Lemon-Lime&quot;, &quot;Tropical blend&quot;, &quot;Blueberry-Pomegranate&quot;, &quot;Raspberry Melon&quot;, and &quot;Glacier Freeze&quot;. SymphonyIRI Group named G2 the &quot;top new food product of 2008&quot;, noting that the product generated retail sales of $159.1 million in its first full year of production.

Gatorade Tiger was a Gatorade Thirst Quencher sports drink formed as the result of a sponsorship arrangement with Tiger Woods. Debuting in March 2008, Gatorade Tiger was available in &quot;Red Drive&quot; (cherry), &quot;Cool Fusion&quot; (lemon-lime), and &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; (grape). Gatorade Tiger contained 25% more electrolytes than Gatorade Thirst Quencher. As part of the 2009 rebranding, Gatorade Tiger was re-labeled as Focus. It was reformulated, adding the amino acid theanine, which is naturally found in many forms of tea, improving mental focus. Focus contained about 25 mg per serving or 50 mg per bottle. On November 25, 2009, it was reported by &quot;Beverage Digest&quot;, and later confirmed by PepsiCo, that they had made a decision, several months before November 2009, to discontinue some products to make room for the Prime and Recover products as part of a then-upcoming G Series re-branding. In 2015, the Gatorade Energy gummies made their debut along with the Gatorade energy bar.

===Re-branding===
In 2010, Gatorade re-branded a number of its products. Original Gatorade was initially re-labeled as Gatorade G. Gatorade Rain was re-labeled as No Excuses. Gatorade AM was re-labeled Shine On; Gatorade X-Factor was relabeled as Be Tough, and Gatorade Fierce was relabeled Bring It. However, these names were short-lived, as a 2% decline in market share in 2009 led to a broader repositioning of the entire line in 2010. Beginning in February 2010, the Gatorade product portfolio was re-positioned around what the company refers to as the G Series, categorizing varieties of its products into three main segments: before, during, and after athletic events.

* The Prime 01 product line consists of a pre-game fuel in a gel consistency, positioned for consumption prior to athletic activity.
* Traditional Gatorade products such as &quot;Gatorade Thirst Quencher&quot; (Original Gatorade), &quot;G2&quot;, and &quot;Gatorade Powder&quot; are categorized under the Perform 02 classification, representing their intention for consumption during periods of physical exertion.
* Recover 03 refers to a post-workout protein and carbohydrate drink, formulated with the consistency of a sports drink. The composition of this beverage reflects its intention to provide both hydration and muscle recovery after exercise.

G Series Pro, a brand extension initially developed for professional athletes, began to be sold in GNC and Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods stores in the U.S. in 2010 after first being available only in professional locker rooms and specialized training facilities. Also in 2010, Gatorade introduced the G Natural Gatorade line which is made with &quot;natural flavors and ingredients&quot;, specifically sweetened with Stevia and sold in Whole Foods grocery stores within the United States. G Natural was released in two flavors: G Orange Citrus and G2 Berry. The G Series began to replace prior iterations of Gatorade product lines in the U.S. (the brand&#x27;s highest volume market) in 2010. While Gatorade products have historically been developed for athletes engaging in competitive sporting events, a separate line of products formulated for consumption before, during and after personal fitness exercise was introduced in the U.S. in 2011. Labeled under the name G Series FIT, this product line consists of pre-workout fruit-and-nut bites, lightly flavored electrolyte replacement drinks, as well as post-workout protein recovery smoothies.

G Organic with interest from consumers and two years of research, Gatorade developed an organic version of the sports drink. The product was launched in 2016 with three initial flavors (Lemon, Mixed Berry, and Strawberry), was USDA certified organic through each step of the process, contained sea salt, and no artificial colors.

Gx Sweat, in March 2021, Gatorade released Gx Sweat patch, which measures a user&#x27;s sweat and hydration. It is the company&#x27;s first wearable product.

Gatorlyte, in 2021, Gatorade released Gatorlyte, a 5-electrolyte blend that they claim provides &#x27;rapid rehydration&#x27;.

Fast Twitch, in 2023, Gatorade released Fast Twitch, an energy drink that they claim will &#x27;ignite power and athletic performance&#x27;.

==Composition and health concerns==

The original Gatorade is based on oral rehydration therapy, a mixture of salt, sugar, and water, with the citrus-based flavoring and added food coloring. The composition of individual Gatorade products varies depending upon the product in question, as well as the country in which it is sold. Gatorade Thirst Quencher contains water, sucrose (table sugar), dextrose, citric acid, natural flavor, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium citrate, monopotassium phosphate, and flavoring/coloring ingredients. Some Gatorade flavor variations used to contain brominated vegetable oil as a stabilizer. Brominated vegetable oil was discontinued in 2013, and has been replaced with sucrose acetate isobutyrate. An serving of Gatorade Perform 02 (Gatorade Thirst Quencher) contains 50 calories, 14 grams of carbohydrates, 110 mg sodium and 30 mg potassium.

Gatorade Thirst Quencher is sweetened using a sucrose-dextrose mix. For a period of time in the 1990s and early 2000s, high fructose corn syrup was used to sweeten Gatorade distributed in North America, but as of 2011, the drink is once again sweetened with a sucrose–dextrose combination, which the company describes as being &quot;preferred by consumers&quot;. G2 and G2 Natural, labeled as being &quot;lower calorie&quot; variants, are sweetened in part with PureVia, an extract of the Stevia plant.

The presence of calories, sugar, and sodium in Gatorade products has drawn attention from public school constituents, who have raised question over whether the sale of Gatorade beverages should be permitted in such schools. In 2010, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sponsored a bill () which proposed a ban on the sale of sports drinks in California schools. In 2015, the University of California, San Francisco began to phase out the sale of sodas, sports drinks and energy drinks in its cafeterias, vending machines, and campus catering and retail locations, and began to &quot;sell only zero-calorie beverages or non-sweetened drinks with nutritional value, such as milk and 100% juice&quot;.

There are 34 g of sugar (8 teaspoons) in one bottle of regular Gatorade. The USDA&#x27;s recommended daily maximum of added sugars per person is about 50 grams. According to the American Heart Association, the recommended maximum amount of sugar is 25 grams per day for women and 36 grams per day for men. The American Heart Association states that children and teens should drink no more than of sugary beverages per week.

In 2012, a study on nearly 11,000 teens reported that &quot;teens put on even more weight if they drank a bottle of sports drink each day, averaging for every sports drink consumed per day&quot;. The researchers concluded, &quot;We need to educate parents and clinicians about what constitutes a sugary drink... Sports drinks are promoted by professional athletes as a healthy drink, but they really don&#x27;t need to be used by kids unless they are continually exercising for long periods or they&#x27;re in hot climates.&quot;

The USDA states that the average American will consume of sugar each year, almost of sugar per day. One of the most prevalent ways that sugar is consumed is through drinks. Most people do not notice the amount of sugar that one given drink can have.

In January 2013, the Gatorade manufacturer (PepsiCo) agreed to remove brominated vegetable oil (BVO) from its Gatorade products in the USA amidst health concerns.
The composition of Gatorade in Europe, Japan and India remain unaffected as BVO was outlawed there 23 years earlier.

==Research and development==

Gatorade&#x27;s inventors went on to develop new sports drinks. Gatorade&#x27;s owners sued to acquire rights to these new products, but they never made them available publicly. First, Shires and Cade developed Go!, a drink that, unlike Gatorade, contained protein to stimulate muscular recovery. Stokley-Van Camp paid &quot;a fee to have the exclusive rights for some period of time, but they never did develop it&quot;.

In 1989, Cade created a new sports drink that he claimed was more effective than Gatorade. The new product was called TQ2, shorthand for Thirst Quencher 2. The patent application read:

&quot;The invention described here is a novel fluid composition which surprisingly and advantageously maintains blood volume at levels well above those observed in the absence of fluids or even with Gatorade.&quot;

In an experiment with cyclists, Cade found that TQ2 allowed athletes to endure for 30% longer than Gatorade.

Cade pitched the TQ2 product to Pepsi and other beverage companies. Meanwhile, Gatorade&#x27;s owner Quaker sued Cade. After years of legal proceedings, Cade was forced to sell TQ2 to Quaker in 1993. Quaker &quot;bagged&quot; TQ2, never releasing it to the public. Gatorade claimed that its research found that TQ2 was not an improvement over the original Gatorade formula. Cade, on the other hand, continued to stand by his product. He accused Quaker and Gatorade of stifling the publication of the research behind TQ2.
The Gatorade Sports Science Institute (GSSI), a research facility operated in Barrington, Illinois, has been featured in a number of the company&#x27;s commercials. Established in 1985 and closed in 2022, this organization consisted of scientists studying the correlation and effects of exercise, environmental variables, and nutrition on the human body. According to Darren Rovell, &quot;GSSI was created at a time when there was a lot of scientific controversy, since there wasn&#x27;t much public evidence that Gatorade actually worked...GSSI was also created to be part of Gatorade&#x27;s powerful marketing arm.&quot;

It regularly conducted testing and research on how hydration and nutrition affect athletic performance. Professional athletes such as Eli Manning as well as collegiate and amateur athletes have been involved in fitness testing programs at the GSSI, which in part have led to innovations in new Gatorade formula variations and product lines.

In 2001, the GSSI observed that professional race car drivers were not maintaining adequate levels of hydration during races, attributable to the nature of drivers enduring multiple-hour races in high temperatures. As a result, it developed a product called the &quot;Gatorade In-Car Drinking System&quot;, which has since been implemented in the vehicles of many professional race car drivers.

In addition to the former Gatorade Sports Science Institute, Gatorade sponsors external health and fitness research. In 1992, Gatorade paid the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) $250,000. A year later, Gatorade and the American College of Sports Medicine held a roundtable meeting on &quot;exercise and fluid replacement&quot;. The ACSM published the meeting&#x27;s results in 1996, advising athletes to drink &quot;at a rate sufficient to replace all the water lost through sweating&quot; or &quot;the maximal amount that can be tolerated&quot;. Gatorade continues to sponsor the American College of Sports Medicine, though the exact amount it pays is not public.

==Advertising and publicity==

Early Gatorade advertisements claimed that the drink moved through the body 12 times faster than water. Research found that this was not true - Gatorade moves through the body at the same speed as water. Gatorade removed the claim from its advertisements. Gatorade advertisements have claimed that athletes need to consume at least &quot;40 oz. per hour [] or your performance could suffer&quot;. South African exercise physiologist Tim Noakes found that Cynthia Lucero died from exercise-associated hyponatremic encephalopathy drinking Gatorade at &quot;the rate recommended by the advertisements&quot;.
Gatorade is the official sports drink of the NFL, MLB, NBA, WNBA, USA Basketball, NHL, Association of Volleyball Professionals, Indian Super League, High School Sports Teams, NASCAR, and other professional and collegiate athletic organizations, providing supplies of the drinks to sponsored teams in some cases. Distribution was extended to include the U.K. in 2008, coinciding with an agreement designating Gatorade as the official sports drink of Chelsea F.C. (for outside of the U.S. and Canada) Gatorade&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Be Like Mike&quot; ads featured Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, a North American basketball team which had just won its first National Basketball Association championship at the time. The ads began airing in August 1991 and &quot;Be Like Mike&quot; became a household phrase in the United States. In 2015, new versions of the ads were produced to commemorate the brand&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

In more recent years, the Gatorade brand has continued to employ professional sports athletes in the promotion of its products. Primary endorsers in the 2000s have included Major League Baseball player Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees, National Hockey League player Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins, National Basketball Association player Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls, PGA Tour golfer Tiger Woods, and National Football League quarterback Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos.

In April 2014, it was announced that Gatorade would become an official supplier to Formula 1 team Sahara Force India. Gatorade became the main global sponsor for the UEFA Champions League starting in the 2015–18 cycle outside of North America. In November 2021, Gatorade signed UConn basketball superstar Paige Bueckers, making her the company&#x27;s first college endorser since the NCAA allowed athletes at its member schools to receive compensation for product endorsements. At the time, other athlete endorsers included basketball players Elena Delle Donne, Jayson Tatum, and Zion Williamson; NFL quarterback Trevor Lawrence; track star Sydney McLaughlin, and tennis great Serena Williams. By December 2023, Gatorade had signed three other college athletes to similar deals—football players Shedeur Sanders of Colorado and Nick Singleton of Penn State, and basketball superstar Caitlin Clark of Iowa.

Gatorade also hosts a variety of awards given to high school athletes who excel in their respective sports. One prominent award given is the Gatorade National Football Player of the Year.

== The Gatorade shower ==

The Gatorade shower, originally called the &quot;Gatorade Dunk&quot;, is an American sports tradition in which players from a victorious team sneak up behind the head coach with a Gatorade cooler and pour the entire contents (generally Gatorade and ice) over his head at the end of a game.

This tradition was popularized in the mid-1980s when Harry Carson and Jim Burt, of the New York Giants, doused head coach Bill Parcells during the 1985 season. Burt&#x27;s teammates picked up on this practice and popularized it during the team&#x27;s championship season of 1986–87. The tradition has since become a recurring tradition across other team sports, including Canadian football. The name may be used even when other drinks such as water or Powerade are substituted.

== Gatorade and oral rehydration ==

In the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, aid agencies were struggling to save the lives of thousands of Rwandan refugees dying of dehydration due to cholera in camps in eastern Zaire. The aid agency AmeriCares was heavily criticized for choosing to provide Gatorade as a form of oral rehydration solution. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated:

But while Gatorade might be good for athletes, it is not good for cholera, said Dr. Michael Toole, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control. Gatorade does not have all the essential ingredients that an I.V. has, and people who were given it might have taken more appropriate solutions, Dr. Toole said.

AmeriCares&#x27; president responded: &quot;We stand by our decision to ship Gatorade to Rwandan refugees. In the absence of potable water, Gatorade, with its electrolytes and water, saved countless lives in a true triage situation.&quot;

<text>The Church of God in Christ (COGIC) is an international Holiness–Pentecostal Christian denomination, and a large Pentecostal denomination in the United States. Although an international and multi-ethnic religious organization, it has a predominantly African-American membership based within the United States. The international headquarters is in Memphis, Tennessee. The current Presiding Bishop is Bishop John Drew Sheard Sr., who is the Senior Pastor of the Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ of Detroit, Michigan. He was elected as the denomination&#x27;s leader on March 27, 2021. On November 12, 2024, Bishop Sheard was re-elected by acclamation to serve another four-year term as the presiding bishop and chief apostle of the denomination.

== Background ==

=== Holiness origins ===

The Church of God in Christ was formed in 1897 by a group of disfellowshipped Baptists, most notably Charles Price Jones (1865–1949) and Charles Harrison Mason (1864–1961). In 1895, C. P. Jones and C. H. Mason were licensed Baptist ministers in Mississippi who began teaching and preaching the Wesleyan doctrine of Christian perfection or entire sanctification as a second work of grace to their Baptist congregations. Mason was influenced by the testimony of the African-American Methodist evangelist Amanda Berry Smith, one of the most widely respected African American holiness evangelists of the nineteenth century. Her life story led many African Americans into the Holiness movement, including Mason. He testified to receiving entire sanctification after reading her autobiography in 1893.

In June 1896, Jones held a Holiness convention at Mt. Helm Baptist Church in Jackson, Mississippi, attended by Mason and others from several states. Protestant doctrinal debates about Calvinism and Wesleyan Perfectionism affected how even local African-American Baptist pastors responded to new Christian movements at the time. Some of these African-American Baptist pastors in local Southern areas such as Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas considered Jones and Mason to be controversial. The leadership of the Mississippi State Convention of the National Baptist Convention intervened and expelled Jones, Mason, and others who embraced the Wesleyan teaching of entire sanctification.

In 1897, Elder Mason founded the St. Paul Church in Lexington, Mississippi, as the first church of the new movement. At its first convocation held in 1897, the group identified simply as the &quot;Church of God.&quot; Many Holiness Christian groups and fellowships forming at the time wanted biblical names for their local churches and fellowships, such as &quot;Church of God, Church of Christ, or Church of the Living God&quot;. They rejected denominational names such as Baptist, Methodist, or Episcopal. Since so many new holiness groups and fellowships were forming that used the name &quot;Church of God,&quot; C. H. Mason sought a name to distinguish his Holiness group from others.

Later in 1897, while in Little Rock, Arkansas, C. H. Mason stated that God had given him such a name for the group, the &quot;Church of God in Christ&quot;. He believed that the name, taken from 1 Thessalonians 2:14, was divinely revealed and biblically inspired. This Holiness group/fellowship adopted the name Church of God in Christ, and COGIC began to develop congregations throughout the South. C. P. Jones was elected the General Overseer, C. H. Mason was selected as Overseer of Tennessee, and J. A. Jeter was selected as Overseer of Arkansas. After testifying to being sanctified, members of the church referred to themselves as &quot;Saints&quot;, believing that they were set apart to live a daily life of Christian Holiness in words and deeds.

===Pentecostal origins===
By 1906, the church had grown to nearly 100 congregations in three states. Desiring to learn more about the work of the Holy Spirit in the church, C. H. Mason, J. A Jeter and D. J. Young were appointed as a committee by C. P. Jones to investigate reports of a revival in Los Angeles, California that was being led by an itinerant preacher named William J. Seymour. Jones was acquainted with Seymour between 1895 and 1905, as Seymour&#x27;s travels led him to many Holiness preachers such as John G. Lake and Martin Wells Knapp. Mason stayed in Los Angeles for five weeks and his visit to the Azusa Street Revival changed the direction of the newly formed holiness church. During his visit, Mason received the baptism of the Holy Ghost; the evidence was believed to be his &quot;speaking in other tongues&quot;, in accordance with the biblical account found in the book of Acts 2:4. Upon his return to Jackson, Mississippi, Mason faced opposition when he recounted his experience. Not everyone in the church were willing to accept &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; as the initial evidence of baptism of the Holy Ghost. At the general convention held in Jackson in 1907, a separation occurred among Jones and other leaders in the church because of such disagreements.

After being ejected for accepting these new Pentecostal teachings, Mason called a meeting in Memphis later in the year and reorganized the Church of God in Christ as a Holiness-Pentecostal body. The early pioneers of this newly formed Holiness-Pentecostal body in 1907 were E. R. Driver, J. Bowe, R. R. Booker, R. E. Hart, W. Welsh, A. A. Blackwell, E. M. Blackwell, E. M. Page, R. H. I. Clark, D. J. Young, James Brewer, Daniel Spearman, and J. H. Boone. These elders became the first Pentecostal General Assembly of the Church of God in Christ. They unanimously chose C.H. Mason as General Overseer and Chief Apostle. Mason was given authority to lead the new denomination.

In 1907, with ten congregations, The Church of God in Christ became the first &quot;legally&quot; chartered Pentecostal body incorporated in the United States. C. P. Jones and those Holiness leaders who did not embrace the Azusa Revival experience continued as Holiness churches. In 1915, after years of court litigation over the name of the organization and use of the name &quot;Church of God in Christ&quot; by the two groups; Mason&#x27;s group was granted the use of the name and Jones&#x27;s group organized a legally chartered Holiness body called the Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A.

== History ==
=== Bishop C. H. Mason era (1897–1961) ===
After moving to Memphis, Tennessee, Bishop Mason established a local congregation called Temple COGIC. He also established the COGIC national headquarters there. He called for an annual gathering of COGIC members, known as the &quot;International Holy Convocation&quot;, to be held in Memphis. Originally, this gathering of the &#x27;Saints&#x27; lasted for twenty days, from November 25 to December 14. This seasonal period was selected because most of the COGIC members were farmers and were finished harvesting their crops around this time. COGIC members gathered for praying, fasting, teaching, preaching, fellowship and conducting business related to the national COGIC organization.

COGIC originated among African Americans in the Southern states of Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. But during the early twentieth century, the Pentecostal movement had rapid growth nationally and attracted racially integrated congregants to its worship services. Bishop Mason was pivotal in licensing and credentialing both white and African American ministers, who spread the Pentecostal message and planted new churches. The first general secretary of COGIC was Elder William B. Holt, a white minister. During 1910–1913, two white ministers, Elder H. A. Goss and Elder Leonard P. Adams, were clergy under the authority of C. H. Mason. They were given the authority through a &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; to license ministers and establish churches under the COGIC name.

A few years after the Azusa Revival, in 1914, shortly before the United States entered World War I, approximately 300 white ministers, representing a variety of independent churches and networks of churches, including the &quot;Association of Christian Assemblies&quot; of Indiana; and the &quot;Church of God in Christ and in Unity with the Apostolic Faith Movement&quot; from Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas; met in Hot Springs, Arkansas. They determined to separate from COGIC and form what would eventually become the Worldwide Fellowship of the Assemblies of God. There seemed no prospect of an integrated Pentecostal movement under the leadership of an African American such as C. H. Mason. White Americans also, while receiving credentials from COGIC, continued to work along segregated lines; Howard Goss, one of the many white ministers, described the relationship with COGIC as &quot;an association...mainly for purposes of business.&quot; The organizers of the meeting in Hot Springs had sent invitations only to white ministers to discuss a new movement, although racial and ethnic minorities did attend.

The H. A. Goss faction left COGIC to join the Assemblies of God USA. Over time, the ministers and churches under Leonard P. Adams also separated from COGIC; they assimilated into other white Pentecostal groups or organizations. In 1916, a few white churches were organized as a white branch of COGIC. William B. Holt was appointed as General Superintendent. The racial climate in the post WWI years, when there was high competition for jobs and housing and violent unrest in many cities in 1919, would not sustain this relationship. It ultimately ended by 1930, when the Depression set in.

Mason continued to travel across the nation preaching and establishing COGIC churches. As African Americans migrated north and west to industrial cities during the Great Migration, he began to establish COGIC churches in the north and, especially after 1940, in the west. Mason sent ministers and evangelists to cities and urban areas outside the South, including William Roberts (Chicago), O. M. Kelly (New York), O. T. Jones Sr. (Philadelphia), E. R. Driver (Los Angeles), and Samuel Kelsey (Washington, D.C.) From these major cities, COGIC spread throughout the country.

In 1926, Mason authorized the church&#x27;s constitution, outlining the bylaws, rules, and regulations of the church. In 1933, he set apart five overseers to the Office of Bishop in the church, the first five bishops of COGIC.

The first national tabernacle was built and completed in 1925. It was destroyed by fire in 1936. In 1945, Mason dedicated Mason Temple in Memphis as the church&#x27;s national meeting site. Built in the 1940s during World War II, the nearly 4000-seat building was the largest church auditorium of any African American religious group in the United States.

In 1951, when Bishop Mason was approaching 85 years of age, he set up a &quot;special commission&quot; to help with the administration and oversight of the church. On June 5, 1951, he selected Bishop A. B. McEwen, Bishop J. S. Bailey, and Bishop O. M. Kelly as his assistants. On May 19, 1952, he added Bishop J. O. Patterson Sr. Also in 1952, Mason revised the constitution to determine the leadership and succession of the church after his death. Three years later on October 12, 1955, he added three more bishops to the hierarchy: Bishop U. E. Miller, Bishop S. M. Crouch, and Bishop O. T. Jones Sr. This group of seven bishops became known officially as the executive commission; they took on greater responsibility over church affairs until Mason&#x27;s death.

In 1907, there were ten COGIC churches, but by the time of Bishop Mason&#x27;s death in 1961, COGIC had spread to every state in the United States and to many foreign countries. It had a membership of more than 400,000, who supported more than 4,000 churches.

=== Bishop O.T. Jones Sr. era (1962–1968) ===
The years of 1962–1968 has been described as a &quot;Dark Period&quot; in the history of the Church of God in Christ, because there was polarization and conflict in leadership following the death of the founder. After Mason&#x27;s death, in accordance with the 1952 church constitution, the control of the church reverted to the COGIC Board of Bishops. However, the General Assembly vested authority in the executive board composed of the seven bishops selected by Bishop Mason before his death. The COGIC constitution at the time did not identify a clear successor or the authority of the executive board after Mason&#x27;s death. A. B. McEwen was elected chairman of the executive board, and O.T. Jones Sr. was elected Senior Bishop by the General Assembly.

Bishop Ozro Thurston Jones Sr. was pastor of the Holy Temple Church of God in Christ in Philadelphia and the Jurisdictional Bishop of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Jurisdiction. Bishop Jones was the only living bishop of the five original bishops consecrated by Bishop Mason. After the death of Bishop Mason, he assumed leadership as the Senior Bishop of the Church of God in Christ. In 1964 however, disagreement between the authority of the Senior Bishop and the executive board, led by Bishop A. B. McEwen, came to a head and was addressed at the 57th Holy Convocation. Factions developed within the organization as both the senior bishop and Bishop A. B. McEwen made conflicting administrative and executive decisions.

The parties filed lawsuits in the Chancery Court of Shelby County, Tennessee, to resolve the legitimate authority of the denomination. The court ordered the church to convene a constitutional convention in February 1968. The constitutional convention drafted and approved a new constitution which dissolved both the office of the Senior Bishop and the executive board; it also established the General Assembly, which meets biannually, as the supreme authority over the church to decide matters of faith and practice. Furthermore, the new constitution created the office of the presiding bishop and a general board of twelve bishops and defined their responsibilities. The presiding bishop and all twelve members of the general board are to be elected every four years and preside over the church when the General Assembly is not in session. On November 14, 1968, the General Assembly of the COGIC elected the first general board and presiding bishop of the church.

==== First general board 1968–1972 ====

* Bishop J. O. Patterson Sr. – presiding bishop
* Bishop J. S. Bailey – first assistant presiding bishop
* Bishop S. M. Crouch – second assistant presiding bishop
* Bishop W. N. Wells
* Bishop L. H. Ford
* Bishop O. M. Kelly
* Bishop C. E. Bennett
* Bishop J. A. Blake
* Bishop J. W. White
* Bishop D. L. Williams
* Bishop F. D. Washington
* Bishop J. D. Husband
Several bishops disagreed with the new organizational structure; they severed ties with COGIC to start their own organizations. The most notable rift occurred in 1969, when fourteen bishops met in Evanston, Illinois, to form the Church of God in Christ, International. They disagreed in having an electoral process to select the presiding bishop.

Another body operating under the same name Church of God in Christ, International, split and organized in the Northeast area under Bishop R. T. Jones of Philadelphia and later Bishop C. E. Williams Sr. of Brooklyn, New York City.

Bishop O. T. Jones Sr, however, did not leave the COGIC. After being removed from the office of Senior Bishop, he remained the Jurisdictional Bishop of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania until his death in 1972. COGIC continued to grow and in 1973, the church claimed a worldwide membership of nearly three million.

=== Bishop J. O. Patterson era (1968–1989) ===
Bishop James Oglethorpe Patterson Sr. was elected in November 1968 as the first presiding bishop of the church by the General Assembly at the Sixty-First Holy Convocation of the church. Bishop Patterson was also to date the youngest person to ever be elected presiding bishop of COGIC at the age of 56; the second youngest was his nephew Gilbert Earl (G.E.) Patterson, who became presiding bishop in 2000 at the age of 60. The son-in-law of Bishop Mason, J. O. Patterson Sr., had served the church previously as a member of the executive board and as executive secretary. He was pastor of the Pentecostal Temple Institutional COGIC in Memphis, Tennessee, and was the Presiding Prelate of the Tennessee Headquarters Jurisdiction. Patterson established protocols of worship, policy and practices. A new constitution and official manual of the church were completed in 1973. COGIC became a major force in the collective Black Church and worldwide Pentecostal movement. It has had rapid growth in many regions as one of the fastest-growing and largest religious groups in the United States.

As the first elected presiding bishop, Bishop Patterson Sr. established the Charles Harrison Mason Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia.

In 1982, Patterson led COGIC in its Diamond Jubilee, in a celebration of the International Holy Convocation. He established the World Fellowship of Black Pentecostal Churches and gained COGIC membership in the Congress of National Black Churches. His dream was to establish an international ministry complex known as &quot;Saints Center&quot; and an accredited institution known as &quot;All Saints University&quot;. He was elected four times uncontested as presiding bishop. He consecrated and appointed more than 100 bishops during his twenty-one years of leadership.

=== Bishop L. H. Ford era (1990–1995) ===
Bishop Louis Henry Ford of Chicago, Illinois, was elected after the death of J.O. Patterson Sr. in 1989. Ford was pastor of the St. Paul COGIC in Chicago and was Presiding Prelate of the Historic Illinois First Jurisdiction. He was a strong advocate for social justice. He became nationally recognized in 1955 for officiating at the funeral of 15-year-old Emmett Till, who was brutally murdered in Mississippi. He gave the eulogy for Till at Robert&#x27;s Temple COGIC in 1955.

Bishop Ford also renovated several COGIC structures in Memphis, including Mason Temple. Bishop Ford is credited with inviting President Bill Clinton, a personal friend, to speak to the Eighty-Sixth International Holy Convocation on November 13, 1993. Clinton is the only US president to have addressed a COGIC convocation at Mason Temple.

=== Bishop C. D. Owens era (1995–2000) ===
Bishop Chandler David Owens Sr. was elected Presiding Bishop after the death of Bishop Ford in 1995. C. D. Owens had gained national attention in the church as the president of the Youth Department. He was a noted evangelist who had pastored several churches, including: Bostick Temple in St. Louis, Missouri; Well&#x27;s Cathedral COGIC in Newark, New Jersey; and Greater Community COGIC in Marietta, Georgia. He also served as the Presiding Prelate of the New Jersey Garden State Jurisdiction and the Central Georgia Jurisdiction. Bishop Owens led the COGIC in its centennial celebration in 1997 with the theme, &quot;Holiness, a Proven Foundation for a Promising Future!&quot; He is credited with systematically restructuring church departments and ministries, expanding the church in Asia, primarily India and the Philippines, and placing the COGIC on a solid financial status. Owens outlined a progressive plan to position the COGIC for ministry in the twenty-first century, known as &quot;Vision 2000 and Beyond.&quot; In 2000 at the Ninety-Third International Holy Convocation, the COGIC General Assembly elected Bishop Gilbert Earl Patterson to replace Owens as Presiding Bishop. Owens continued to serve as a jurisdictional bishop and member of the General Board until his death in 2011.

=== Bishop G. E. Patterson era (2000–2007) ===
Bishop Gilbert Earl (G. E.) Patterson began his ministry as co-pastor of the Holy Temple COGIC with his father, Bishop W. A. Patterson. In 1975, he resigned as co-pastor, withdrawing his membership in the COGIC because of leadership disagreements with his uncle, J. O. Patterson Sr. concerning an establishment of another jurisdiction in the city of Memphis. J. O. Patterson Sr. was the Presiding Bishop at that time. G. E. Patterson established the Temple of Deliverance, the Cathedral of Bountiful Blessing which grew to become the largest Pentecostal church in Memphis with over 14,000 members. In 1988, after a thirteen-year exodus from COGIC, Bishop G. E. Patterson returned as the founding Prelate of the newly formed Tennessee Fourth Jurisdiction. In 2000, he was elected as the Presiding Bishop of COGIC. Bishop Patterson was the second youngest person to ever be elected Presiding Bishop of COGIC at the age 60 in 2000, second to his uncle, Bishop J. O. Patterson Sr. who was 56 when he was elected Presiding Bishop in 1968. He re-ignited the church to be a flagship Pentecostal denomination. He was able to bridge denominational barriers and encourage non-COGIC ministries to work collboratively with the COGIC denomination. He established COGIC Charities which has provided thousands of dollars in college scholarships and disaster relief efforts such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

===Bishop C. E. Blake Era (2007–2021)===
Bishop Charles E. Blake assumed leadership and was elected Presiding Bishop of the church after the death of Bishop G.E. Patterson in March 2007. Bishop Blake is the senior pastor of the West Angeles Cathedral COGIC in Los Angeles. For many years, West Angeles has been one of the fastest growing churches in the United States and remains the largest COGIC local congregation with a membership of 25,000. C. E. Blake served as the Presiding Prelate of the First Jurisdiction of Southern California. Bishop Blake led COGIC through the death of G. E. Patterson while preparing the church for its 100th Holy Convocation; an important milestone for the church. Bishop Blake led the COGIC to become a greater global ministry, primarily in Africa and Latin America, while at the same time investing in the inner cities where many COGIC congregations are located. He is also known for his aggressive initiative, &quot;Save Africa&#x27;s Children&quot; which supports hundreds of African children who have been affected by HIV/AIDS in orphanages in several countries in Africa. In 2009, Bishop Blake unveiled an aggressive program known as &quot;Urban Initiatives&quot; to address the plight of America&#x27;s urban areas. In 2010, Bishop Blake led more than 50,000 delegates to the 103rd International Holy Convocation to St. Louis, Missouri. In April 2018, Bishop Blake led COGIC in partnership with American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis to continue to struggle for civil rights in the 21st century. On October 23, 2020, Bishop Blake announced that he will not seek a re-election as Presiding Bishop nor as a member of the General Board and that he would retire from the Office of Presiding Bishop and from the General Board in 2021.

===Bishop J. D. Sheard era (2021–present)===

Bishop John Drew Sheard Sr., who had previously been elected to the General Board in 2012 and 2016, was reelected to the General Board and subsequently elected as the current Presiding Bishop on March 20, 2021, in the first-ever virtual online election for the denomination.

In his first year as Presiding Bishop in 2021, in order to combat debt that the church had accrued from previous years, Bishop Sheard helped to launch the &quot;I Love My Church&quot; Initiative, which was a massive fundraising campaign that helped the COGIC denomination to pay off much of its debts, renovate and refurbish its headquarters church, Mason Temple, establish housing complexes for low-income families throughout Shelby County, Tennessee near the church&#x27;s headquarters, and purchased a former Catholic nunnery convent in Memphis to provide housing for single mothers affected by health challenges, disabilities, teen pregnancies, and domestic violence.

==Statistics==

The National Council of Churches ranks COGIC as the fifth largest Christian denomination in the U.S. COGIC is a Holiness–Pentecostal Christian denomination, with a predominantly African American membership. In 2010, According to the US Religious Census, COGIC in the United States had 624,419 members in 2,996 churches. According to a 2015 statistical study by the Pew Research Center, the denomination was estimated to have a United States membership of approximately 84% African Americans, 5% White Americans, 8% Latino-Americans, and roughly 2% Asian-Americans. In 2016, the church had 5.5 million members in 60 countries around the world. In 2022, it was present in 112 countries.

=== Statistics Conflict ===

The Church of God in Christ has not shared official statistics with the public as the website states millions of adherents. This has led to multiple different figures for church membership being declared. For an example, some have stated over 5,000,000 members in the United States. This would place them as the fifth largest Christian denomination in the U.S. and the largest Pentecostal denomination in the nation. In 2020, ARDA&#x27;s U.S. Religious Survey has placed the Church of God in Christ at 920,429 members in 3,313 churches. In the case of ARDA&#x27;s figures, this would place the Church of God in Christ behind other Pentecostal groups in the U.S.

== Theology and beliefs ==
COGIC is a trinitarian Holiness Pentecostal denomination. The church teaches three separate and distinct works of grace that God performs in the life of believers: salvation, entire sanctification, and the baptism or infilling of the Holy Ghost. The church declares to be evangelical in ministry, fundamentalist in doctrine and practice and Pentecostal in worship and expression. COGIC theology and beliefs fall in the tradition of Wesleyan-Arminian theology.

=== Statement of faith ===
The beliefs of the Church of God in Christ are briefly written in its Statement of Faith, which is reproduced below: It is often recited in various congregations as part of the order of worship and all national and international convocations.

* We believe the Bible to be the inspired and only infallible written Word of God.
* We believe that there is One God, eternally existent in three persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
* We believe in the Blessed Hope, which is the rapture of the Church of God, which is in Christ, at His return.
* We believe that the only means of being cleansed from sin is through repentance and faith in the precious Blood of Jesus Christ.
* We believe that the regeneration by the Holy Ghost is absolutely essential for personal salvation.
* We believe that the redemptive work of Christ on the Cross provides healing for the human body in answer to believing prayer.
* We believe that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, according to Acts 2:4, is given to believers who ask for it.
* We believe in the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling a Christian is enabled to live a holy and separated life in the present world. Amen

===Doctrine===

According to the Articles of Religion in the COGIC Official Manual, COGIC believes in biblical inspiration and holds that the Bible is the supreme and final authority for doctrine and practice. There is one God eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. COGIC teaches the deity of Jesus Christ, his virgin birth, sinless life, physical death, burial, resurrection, ascension and visible return to the earth. Christ is the Head of the church, and He is the only mediator between God and humanity, and there is no salvation in any other. COGIC teaches that the Holy Spirit is alive and active in the world. The Holy Spirit is the agent that equips, empowers, leads, and guides the church until the return of Christ.

COGIC teaches that angels are messengers sent from God who served during the creation, throughout the Old Testament, the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, the establishment of the church and the ministry of the apostles, and continue to be at work in the Kingdom of God. They exist primarily in the spiritual realm and are organized according to duty and function. Demons exist as manifestation of evil or unclean spirits. They are fallen angels who joined Satan in his failed attempt to usurp power in Heaven. They exist today as adversaries to the kingdom, purpose and will of God. As Pentecostals, the church believes that demons can be subdued and subjugated through the power of the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ.

COGIC teaches that man was created in the image of God as a tripartite being having a body, soul, and spirit. Through the cleansing of sins can you live a perfect life free from sin. Sin originated in eternity when Satan committed open rebellion against God in heaven. Sin was transmitted to humanity when Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden, as a result all men have original sin. The result of sin is the depravity of man, broken communion with God, shame and guilt, and physical and spiritual death. Humanity can only be restored through salvation offered only through Jesus Christ. The human soul is immortal and will spend eternity either in heaven as the redeemed or in hell as the damned.

COGIC teaches that salvation is the work of redemption to the sinner and his restoration to divine favor and communion with God. Salvation is an operation of the Holy Spirit upon sinners brought about by repentance toward God, which brings about conversion, faith, justification, and regeneration. It teaches that salvation is a work of grace brought about through faith in Jesus Christ; it does not promulgate nor encourage the doctrine of eternal security, also known as &quot;once saved, always saved.&quot;

COGIC teaches that sanctification is a continuous operation of the Holy Spirit, by which he &quot;delivers the justified sinner from the pollution of sin, renews his whole nature in the image of God and enables him to perform good works&quot;. It is a separate and distinct work of grace that occurs in the lives of believers after conversion. It teaches that sanctification should precede the baptism with the Holy Spirit.

COGIC teaches that the baptism of the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit is an experience subsequent to conversion and sanctification, can be experienced by all believers who ask for it. As a Pentecostal church, COGIC teaches that when one is baptized in the Holy Spirit, the believer will experience an initial evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia) by the will of God. COGIC does not teach that Spirit baptism is the same as salvation. According to the Articles of Religion, &quot;We believe that we are not baptized with the Holy Ghost in order to be saved, but that we are baptized with the Holy Ghost because we are saved&quot;. COGIC also teaches that all the spiritual gifts are for believers today.

COGIC teaches that the church is the community of Christian believers who have accepted Jesus Christ and submit to his Lordship and authority in their lives. It can be spoken of as the individual and the collective, physical and spiritual. It includes not only those who are members of COGIC, but all believers who have placed their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. COGIC teaches that according to the Word of God, there will be final events and conditions that address the end of this present age of the world. These events include physical death, the intermediate state, bodily resurrection, the Second Coming of Christ, the Great Tribulation, the Battle of Armageddon, the Millennial Reign, the Final Judgment, the future of the wicked in hell, and life for the redeemed in heaven.

COGIC believes in divine healing, however, it does not advocate the exclusion of medical supervision. It believes that the gifts of the Spirit are given to believers and are active in the church today. The ordinances of the church are water baptism by immersion, the Lord&#x27;s Supper and foot washing. The church does not practice infant baptisms or christenings, but does conduct baby dedications in formal ceremonies.

=== Distinctives ===
As a classical Holiness Pentecostal denomination, COGIC continues to embrace its holiness heritage, teaching modesty in dress, appearance, moderate participation in secular entertainment and prohibitions against profanity, alcohol, substance abuse and immoral behavior. The church has a tradition of prayer, fasting, praise, and consecration that was once unique to Holiness or Holiness Pentecostal groups. Many mainline denominations and countless nondenominational churches that once rejected these beliefs and practices have adopted these distinctions in their worship liturgy and lifestyle practices.

==== Abortion ====

COGIC has always been traditionally anti-abortion. The denomination teaches that God gives life to human beings, biologically and spiritually, through the moment of conception in the womb of the mother, using Jeremiah 1:5, Genesis 1:26–27, and Psalms 139:13–16 as their scriptural basis for this belief. COGIC teaches that because God uses conception through and after sexual reproduction and intercourse to create human life, that willfully aborting a human fetus is contrary to God&#x27;s Word and Christian ethics, and it is considered to be a sin against God and the Bible within the denomination. However, the Church believes that in some extreme or rare cases, medical and operational abortion may be the safest way to help the mother if the pregnancy is jeopardizing the mother&#x27;s life and health. COGIC believes, though, that even then in the case of saving the life of the mother, that abortion should still only be considered as a last resort, if all other options to help the mother and the unborn fetus have been thoroughly exhausted. COGIC believes &quot;...that if such a case arises, the mother should pray and seek the wisdom and guidance of God and the Holy Spirit on whether or not they should resort to emergency abortion if it is necessary to save her life,&quot; but if not, the Church traditionally encourages expecting mothers to &quot;...seek God&#x27;s guidance for other options and choices regarding their unborn child so that they do not have to choose aborting it, and can safely go through with their pregnancy until childbirth.&quot; COGIC also encourages mothers that if they know they will not be able to provide proper care to their child, they should seek assistance to give the child up for either private adoption, legal adoption through domestic or international adoption agencies, or foster care.

In July 2016 during their annual Auxiliaries in Ministries convention, COGIC announced their Urban Initiative Outreach ministries and Missions and Charity departments would be partnering up with The Human Coalition, an anti-abortion advocacy group, from 2016 to 2019 for a three-year initiative to encourage COGIC pastors and ministers to encourage anti-abortion advocacy in their local churches. The three-year initiative would also help encourage COGIC clergy to use their missions and charity ministries in local churches to help offer aid and assistance to African Americans and people of other ethnic minorities, and people of low incomes in local communities who are considering and contemplating abortion and offer aid and assistance to people dealing with economic and medical issues from pregnancy. The three-year-initiative with The Human Coalition was also supposed to encourage local COGIC clergy leaders across the United States, both male and female, to partner up with other anti-abortion advocacy groups and Christian ministries to lobby for more anti-abortion restrictions throughout local states.

==== Civil rights ====

Organized in the South and having a predominately African American membership, COGIC has had a long history in advancing civil rights. Pentecostals have been criticized because of their noticeable absence from the official record of activism that has been largely overshadowed by black ministers of other denominations such as Baptists and Methodists; however, there is evidence to verify and document the role and response of COGIC ministers and other Pentecostal denominations to the cause and struggle for Civil Rights in the United States during the 20th Century.

As previously stated, COGIC although predominately black, had a significant white membership during its first decade of existence, with a number of white ministers holding leadership positions in the church. However, after a meeting in Hot Springs, Arkansas that led to the founding of the Assemblies of God, the white constituency of COGIC continued to decline, until it was almost nonexistent by the 1930s. During World War I, the FBI opened a file on Bishop Mason and conducted surveillance on him because of his pacifism during the war. Bishop Mason taught COGIC members against going to war, but more so he was against African American men being called to fight a war overseas for freedom and then coming home and being treated as second-class citizens and being lynched, even in their uniforms, because of racism.

During the 1940s and 50s, Bishop Mason often invited the white elected officials of the city of Memphis to the International Holy Convocation on Civic Night. Overseer E.R. Driver, who was the overseer of California and pastor of the Saints Home COGIC led an interracial congregation made up of many Blacks, Whites, and Latinos, for many years. However, his out-spoken criticism of the racial prejudice and discrimination of whites led most, if not all of them, to leave his church for other ministries where the message against racism was not so obvious and offensive to them. During the 1930s and 40s, a white COGIC elder named James L. Delk who remained in the church after many whites had left, was very active in politics in Missouri and worked to promote civil rights by writing legislatures and petitioning the federal government on the behalf of COGIC. He is credited with helping to secure the steel needed to construct Mason Temple which was virtually impossible during World War II.

During the 1950s and 60s, during the height of the civil rights movement, COGIC ministers and congregations played host to many significant events. In 1955, Emmett Till&#x27;s funeral was held at Robert&#x27;s Temple Church Of God in Christ in Chicago, Illinois. Mamie Till-Mobley was a member of St. Paul COGIC led by then Elder Louis Henry Ford (who would later become the presiding bishop of the denomination) officiated the service. In Chicago, Ford organized voter registration initiatives. He protested during the 1950s and 1960s against lodging segregation in Memphis, while participating in COGIC Holy Convocations there during the Civil Rights era before federal laws prohibiting such segregation.

Medger Evers, the famed NAACP Field representative for the state of Mississippi who was gunned down in the front of his house in 1963 was raised in by his mother as a member of COGIC before later becoming a Baptist. On February 21, 1965, when Malcolm X was assassinated and the family needed a place for his funeral, no major black church or facility would open their doors for the service. COGIC Bishop Alvin A. Childs of the Faith Temple Church of God in Christ (later renamed Child&#x27;s Memorial in his honor) was the clergyman who finally opened his doors. According to Alex Haley, &quot;He and his wife then received bomb threats at home and at church.&quot; Malcolm X&#x27;s Funeral was held in Harlem, New York City at Faith Temple Church Of God in Christ.

In 1965, during the March to Selma, a young COGIC minister Charles E. Blake, (previous COGIC Presiding Bishop) was studying at the Interdenominational Theological Center (ITC) in Atlanta, GA. He led a group of students to participate in the March on Selma. In 1968, Two sanitation workers who were also COGIC members, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, were crushed to death in a garbage compactor where they were taking shelter from the rain. Their pastor was then elder Gilbert Earl Patterson, who also became a COGIC Presiding Bishop, at Holy Temple COGIC in Memphis, Tennessee. He was one of the nine members of the strategy committee that organized the sanitation strike in Memphis. Holy Temple COGIC was the first church to open its doors to the garbage workers. On April 3, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I&#x27;ve Been To The Mountaintop&quot; speech, at Mason Temple Church Of God in Christ in Memphis. He was assassinated the next day, on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel.

Throughout the 1970s and 80s, as COGIC continued to grow to millions of members nationwide, COGIC ministers all over the country continued to advance civil rights in their communities. As the International Holy Convocation grew to thousands, COGIC leaders had to negotiate with city officials to provide hotel accommodations for the saints. Rev. Al Sharpton, a noted civil rights activist, began his ministerial career as a minister in COGIC. His pastor and mentor was Bishop F. D. Washington of Brooklyn, NY. In 1984 and 1988 respectively, Rev. Jesse Jackson was invited to speak during the COGIC International Holy Convocation when he was running for the presidency. During the 1990s, President Bill Clinton was invited by then COGIC Presiding Bishop, Louis Henry Ford to attend the International Holy Convocation. President Clinton gave speeches at COGIC meetings including the International Holy Convocation at Mason Temple and the Women&#x27;s International Convention.

At the start of the new millennium, then COGIC presiding Bishop Gilbert Earl Patterson, continued to support the advancement of civil rights. During the current administration of Presiding Bishop Charles Blake, COGIC unveiled its Urban Initiatives Program to provide 60,000 programs nationwide through its more than 12,000 congregations to continue to promote the work of civil rights, and to reduce poverty, crime and violence, etc. In April 2018, Presiding Bishop Charles Blake along with Lee Saunders, Andrew Young, DeMaurice Smith, and Brian Dunn coordinated the &quot;I AM 2018 Mountaintop Conference&quot; at the historic Mason Temple in Memphis to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

==== Marriage and sexuality ====
COGIC believes marriage is a monogamous sacred, civil, and legal union between a husband and wife that is recognized as a covenant between them and God for the purpose of the couple being a helpmate to each other and raising a family together. COGIC clergy are also allowed to be married. Remarriage is usually highly discouraged, except in the case of the death of a spouse or former spouse. Divorce is considered inconsistent with biblical teachings and is highly discouraged as well, but exceptions are made for special circumstances. COGIC considers any physical, sexual relationship outside of the sanctity of marriage to be outside of the sovereign will of God and unbiblical. COGIC clergy do not officially sanction or recognize same-sex relationships to be united in marriage and the denomination at-large discourages same-sex relationships as unbiblical and immoral. COGIC regards homosexuality and infidelity as immoral and views aspects of sexual behavior and sexuality that do not agree with Biblical scripture as sinful. COGIC policies and bylaws have also been established regarding sexual misconduct of COGIC clergy and laymembers for disciplinary purposes. COGIC clergy are also encouraged to have a certain degree of training in marriage counseling as well.

A 2014 statistical study from the Pew Research Center Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, reported that most members of COGIC usually got married between the ages of 25 and 30, and that over 42% of COGIC members between the ages of 25 and 65+ were married, at least 19% were divorced or separated, 32% were never married, and at least 5% were widowed. The study also found that over 70% of COGIC members overwhelmingly opposed the legalizing of same-sex marriage and considered relationships from infidelity, polygamy, polyamory, and sex outside of marriage as sinful and unbiblical as well.

=== Ecumenism ===

The COGIC has always had a long history with Christian ecumenism, partnering up with and collaborating with other Christian churches and denominations for the purposes of advancing ministry and charity efforts, both in the United States, and globally in foreign countries as well.

When the COGIC was first founded by Bishop Mason in the 1910s, he wanted the denomination to have ecumenical relationships with other predominantly Black Methodist and Baptist churches, but many of them were unwilling to do so at the time because of Mason&#x27;s controversial history with being expelled from his former Baptist ministry associations and churches in Mississippi for preaching sanctification and Pentecostalism. At the time, because many churches disagreed with what they considered its eccentric worship styles and expressions of Pentecostalism, such as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues and the laying on of hands, many churches distanced themselves from the COGIC for many years.

Nevertheless, as time progressed in the 1950s and 60s, and as COGIC began to grow and became increasingly institutionalized as a denomination, several other churches and denominations began partnering up with COGIC&#x27;s leaders to help advance the cause of Civil Rights for African Americans, most notably such as the National Baptist Convention, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and many other similar predominantly Black denominations as well.

During the tenure of Bishop J. O. Patterson Sr. as Presiding Bishop in the 1970s and 80s, Bishop Patterson established several interdenominational Christian schools and seminaries, and helped to establish the World Fellowship of Black Pentecostal Churches and gained COGIC membership in the Congress of National Black Churches as well, a national caucus of Black church denominations that represent different denominations and organizations of the Black Church in America. During the tenure of Bishop L. H. Ford as Presiding Bishop in the 1990s, he helped gain COGIC membership into the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America, a more diverse, international caucus of different Pentecostal church denominations and organizations that sought to heal the racial divides in the North American Pentecostal movement.

During the tenure of Bishop G.E. Patterson, the nephew of the above-mentioned Bishop J.O. Patterson, as Presiding Bishop of the Church in the 2000s, he helped bridge denominational barriers and encouraged non-COGIC ministries and denominations to work collaboratively with the COGIC denomination to help support charity efforts for poor and disadvantaged African Americans and people affected by poverty and disasters in foreign countries through the COGIC Charities Department and the COGIC Missions and Evangelism Department.

Bishop Charles E. Blake, as the Presiding Bishop of the COGIC from the late 2000s up to the 2010s, was also dedicated to increasing and maintaining stable ecumenical relationships from the COGIC with other diverse Christian denominations, most notably Pentecostal/Charismatic churches, Baptist churches, African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Churches, and A.M.E. Zion churches, and even some non-denominational Christian ministries for the purposes of ministry efforts and collaborating on addressing social issues that affect Christians and specifically the Black Church in America, most notably through his Urban Initiatives program.

== Polity and government ==

According to its 1973 Constitution, the church has two structures to govern the church: civil and ecclesiastical. The civil structure of the Church of God in Christ includes a president, first vice-president, second vice-president, general secretary, general treasurer, and the financial secretary. All officers are elected by the General Assembly. The general secretary, general treasurer, and financial secretary terms run concurrent with the current presidential administration that is elected every four years.

=== Corporate structure ===

The legislative authority of the church is vested in a general assembly, composed of the members of the general board, jurisdictional/auxiliary bishops, jurisdictional supervisors, chaplains, pastors, ordained elders, four district missionaries and six lay members from each jurisdiction. The general assembly elects a 12-person general board (presidium) every four years from the college of bishops, who serve functionally as executive directors and administrators of the church. The general assembly meets biannually each year in April and November while the presidium acts as the executive branch of the church, overseeing the day-to-day operation when the general assembly is not in session. As a result, the general board exercises great authority over the church. The presidium includes a separately elected international presiding bishop by the general assembly who serves a term of four years, who, then appoints two assistant presiding bishops. The current presiding bishop is Bishop J. Drew Sheard who was elected in 2021.

National officers of the church are chosen at the general assembly every four years unless special elections are warranted. The judicial board serves as the judicial branch and is the supreme body that interprets polity and practice. It has nine members, elected by the general assembly, including three bishops, three elders, and three lay members.

=== Ecclesiastical structure ===

The Church of God in Christ ecclesiastical structure is an episcopal-presbyterian form of government. Churches are organized in dioceses called jurisdictions, each under the authority of a bishop. There is a presiding bishop, known as the chief apostle of the church. The presiding bishop is part of a general board, consisting of eleven other bishops elected by a general assembly consisting of pastors, elders, chaplains, bishops, missionaries, supervisors, and designated lay delegates. The general assembly is the supreme authority over the church to decide matters of faith and practice. Jurisdictions range in size between 30 and 100 churches. Each state in the US consists of at least one jurisdiction, and several states have more than one jurisdiction. These jurisdictions are then separated into districts, which consist of 5 to 7 churches and are governed by superintendents (ordained elder or pastor). There are more than 200 ecclesiastical jurisdictions around the world, with 170 in the United States. Jurisdictions are set up similar to the national church in terms of composition, polity, and procedure.

== Department ministries ==
During the formative stages of COGIC, Bishop Mason organized departments to further support the work of the church as it continued to grow and expand. These departments include: the Women&#x27;s Department, the Sunday School Department, the Youth Department known as Y.P.W.W. (Young People Willing Workers), and Missions and Evangelism. As COGIC has continued to grow, new departments, auxiliaries, and ministries have been established including the music department, the National Adjutancy, Men&#x27;s Department, COGIC Charities, and Urban Initiatives to name a few. These auxiliaries are found in nearly every church, district, and jurisdiction within COGIC and function to support the holistic approach that COGIC has toward ministry within the church and the larger community that COGIC congregations serve.

=== Women&#x27;s Department ===
Women in COGIC have been influential in the leadership and organization of the church since its inception. They are the largest department in the COGIC. Bishop Mason was opposed to the ordination of women to formal ministry, but in 1911 created an autonomous department to promote the ministry of women in the church. The church believes that women are gifted and called to ministry; it does not, however, officially ordain women to the office of elder, pastor, or bishop. Nevertheless, women are licensed in COGIC to proclaim the gospel as evangelists. COGIC licensed female evangelists may also serve as chaplains in military, federal, state, and local institutions requiring chaplains. This endorsement allows female chaplains who are serving in the military, working in an institution or jails to perform religious services including funerals and weddings. Some pastor&#x27;s wives have served as pastor of congregations usually after the death of a pastor sometimes serving under the title of &quot;shepherdess, shepherd mother, or church administrator&quot;.

==== Organization of the department ====
A general supervisor of women is appointed by the presiding bishop and given authority to lead the International Women&#x27;s Ministry of the church. Each jurisdictional bishop appoints a jurisdictional supervisor to lead the work of the women on a jurisdictional level. The jurisdictional supervisor is assisted by district missionaries who oversee the women&#x27;s ministry of the district. Historically, women in ministry in COGIC are known as &quot;Missionaries&quot; and are designated in two categories: Deaconess Missionary, and Evangelist Missionary. Deaconess Missionaries serve and assist in the ceremonial and temporal affairs of the local church. Evangelist Missionaries are licensed to preach the gospel, conduct gospel meetings, and may be given the oversight of local congregations serving as the church administrator. Recognizing the significance of women to the ministry, COGIC has created numerous positions that allow women to work as counterparts to the department presidents as chair ladies (YPWW) and Elect ladies (Evangelism).

On the local church level in addition to the office of missionary, COGIC developed and has maintained the position of the &quot;church mother.&quot; Church mothers have historically served as the leader of the women&#x27;s ministries in the local congregations. The designated church mother along with other &quot;older and seasoned&quot; women of the church provided the practical teaching of holiness in daily life and practice. Today however, many church mothers have been reserved to titular positions as many pastor&#x27;s wives have assumed the role of leader of women&#x27;s ministries in local congregations. Despite what seems to be obvious limitations to minister because of ordination, women have been given great latitude and numerous opportunities to serve in ministry in COGIC. As a result, many local congregations, foreign missions, and schools were established through the leadership and efforts of women in COGIC.

==== General supervisors for the Department of Women ====
* Mother Lizzie Woods Robinson – first general supervisor (1911–1945)
* Mother Lillian Brooks Coffey – second general supervisor and founding president of the Women&#x27;s International Convention (1946–1964)
* Mother Annie L. Bailey – third general supervisor (1964–1975)
* Mother Mattie McGlothen – fourth general supervisor (1975–1994)
* Mother Emma F. Crouch – fifth general supervisor (1994–1997)
* Mother Willie Mae Rivers – sixth general supervisor (1997–2017)
* Mother Barbara McCoo Lewis – seventh general supervisor (2017–present)
Lizzie Woods Robinson (1911–1945) was the first &quot;General Mother&quot; of the church. Finding two groups of women in the church, one group praying known as the Prayer Band, the other group studying and teaching the Word known as the Bible Band, she combined the two under the name of the Prayer and Bible Band. She organized the sewing circle and after meeting Elder Searcy, she encouraged the women to support mission work through the Home and Foreign Mission bands. As the church continued to grow, she created women auxiliaries including the Purity Class and the Sunshine Band. She began women&#x27;s work on the state level and appointed the first state mothers. Robinson was a staunch advocate for holiness and taught strict guidelines for the women with regard to dress and worldliness. She was greatly interested in the building of Mason Temple and she kept her national building fund drives functioning until she knew the building was ready for dedication. When she died in 1945, she had laid an impressive foundation for the women&#x27;s ministry in COGIC.

Her successor, Lillian Brooks Coffey (1945–1964) was the organizer of the Women&#x27;s International Convention to support the work of foreign missionaries. The first convention was held in Los Angeles, California, in 1951. Today the International Women&#x27;s Convention/Crusade meets annually in May in different cities throughout the nation drawing thousands of women from around the world. It is one of the largest gathering of Christian women from any major denomination and religious organization. Coffey was a child convert to COGIC under the preaching of Bishop Mason, and was influential in organizing many of the auxiliaries, bands, and units that exist within the COGIC Women&#x27;s Department. The most active women&#x27;s auxiliaries include: Missionary Circle, Hospitality, Executive Hospitality, Hulda Club, Wide Awake Band, Minister&#x27;s Wives Circle, Deaconess, Deacon&#x27;s Wives Circle, Prayer Warriors, Young Women&#x27;s Christian Council, Usher Board, Educational Committee, Boy&#x27;s League, Big Brothers, Cradle Roll, Women&#x27;s Chorus, Board of Examiners, Public Relations, News Reporters and the Burners Home and Foreign Mission Bands. Coffey also began the use of the title &quot;Jurisdictional Supervisor&quot; for state mothers as more jurisdictions were forming in each state.

After the death of Mother Coffey in 1964, Dr. Annie L. Bailey (1964–1975), became the third General Supervisor. She was the wife and companion of Bishop John Seth Bailey, a trusted adviser of Bishop Mason, and later the first assistant presiding bishop of the church. The pair modeled the pastor and wife ministry team in COGIC. She developed the International Women&#x27;s Convention into a training institute for women in the ministry. She served as the jurisdictional supervisor of several states including Maryland and New Jersey helping to establish and stabilize struggling jurisdictions. Units added during her tenure as general supervisor were the: business and Professional Women&#x27;s Federation, Rescue Squad, Sunday School Representatives Unit, United Sisters of Charity, National Secretaries Unit, and the Jr. Missionaries.

Dr. Mattie McGlothen (1975–1994) the fourth General Supervisor, was a tremendous organizer with great impact on the development of the Women&#x27;s Department. She was the Jurisdictional Supervisor of Women for California Northern First Jurisdiction. She established new auxiliaries including the International Hospitality Unit, the Educational and Bishop&#x27;s Wives Scholarship funds, WE-12 and Lavender Ladies. She built a home for missionaries in the Bahamas, a pavilion for senior citizens and unwed mothers in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. She also established the Mattie McGlothen Library and Museum in Richmond, California, as a resource for COGIC historical facts and memorabilia. Finally under her administration, the visible presence of women in ministry changed with the introduction of the ministry &quot;habit&quot;. Today thousands of COGIC women when ministering the gospel or serving in official capacities are seen in their civic (black) or ceremonial (white) habits.

After the death of Mother McGlothen, Mother Emma F. Crouch (1994–1997) of Dallas, Texas, served as the fifth General Supervisor. She was the Jurisdictional Supervisor of Women for Texas Southwest Jurisdiction under the late Bishop T. D. Iglehart. In her brief tenure, she encouraged the women to stay focused and supportive to the leadership of the church. One of her contributions was to divide the women&#x27;s fellowship in the local congregations into two groups: The Christian Women&#x27;s Council for the middle aged and senior women, and the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Council (YWCC) for the younger women.

Mother Willie Mae Rivers (1997–2017) of Goose Creek, South Carolina, succeeded Mother Crouch. She is also the Jurisdictional Supervisor of Women for the South Carolina Jurisdiction. She served as chairperson of the board of supervisors, member, Executive Board, member, Screening Committee, member, Program Committee General Church, coordinator, Leadership Conference, International Marshall, secretary, and Assistant General Supervisor for the Department of Women. A local church mother since the age of 21, she was committed to strengthening the auxiliaries in the local churches and to prepare the younger women to carry the mission of COGIC into the Twenty-first Century. Under her leadership, the Women&#x27;s International Convention added the term &quot;and Crusade&quot; to highlight and promote the evangelistic approach of the convention. Mother Rivers also began the &quot;49 and Under&quot; to enlist and focus the younger women of COGIC to remain committed to the doctrine and teachings of the church. Mother Willie Mae Rivers served faithfully for 20 years as General Mother until 2017 and the age of 91.

The current General Supervisor of Women is Dr. Barbara McCoo Lewis of Los Angeles, California. She is also the Jurisdictional Supervisor for the First Jurisdiction, Southern California. She has previously served on the Women&#x27;s advisory board, Executive Board, steering committee Women&#x27;s International Convention, General Supervisor&#x27;s Regional Representative (West Coast Region of the United States), member of the Program Committee then chairperson, Chairperson Special Convention Assistance Committee, National Leadership Conference and Women&#x27;s Convention Leadership Conference, International Marshall and Assistant General Supervisor. A visionary, she spearheaded the establishment of the multi-million dollar Hale Morris Lewis Manor, a senior citizen complex in Los Angeles, CA.

====Significant women of COGIC ministry====
As has been stated, COGIC does not ordain women as elder or bishop, however, COGIC would not have become the largest predominately African American Pentecostal church in the world, nor have the largest Women&#x27;s convention of any major denomination without the contributions of women.

(#) deceased

=== Sunday School Department ===
The first Sunday School Superintendent was Professor L. W. Lee (1908–1916). In 1924, the Sunday School was formally organized under &quot;Father&quot; F. C. Christmas (1916–1944). Elder L. C. Patrick was added to the National Sunday School. In 1945, Bishop S. Crouch of the Northern California Jurisdiction appointed Elder H. C. Johnson as State Sunday School Superintendent who appointed Missionary Lucille Cornelius to be Chairlady, the first woman to lead the supervision of COGIC women in the Sunday School Department. Mother Jennie Bell Dancy Jones of Arkansas became the first National Field Representative under Bishop Patrick. There was the creation of the Sunday School Field Representative. This office is reserved for a woman who serves as counterpart to the Sunday School Superintendent. These offices are found in every local, district, and jurisdiction to support development and growth of the Sunday School. In 1946, the National Sunday School Congress began to meet with the Young People&#x27;s Willing Workers (YPWW) Congress. In 1951, the first separate National Sunday School Convention convened in Kansas City, Missouri. The current International Sunday School Superintendent is Superintendent Mark Ellis of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the International Field Representative is Mother Cleolia Penix of Chicago, Illinois.

=== Young People Willing Workers (YPWW) International Youth Department (IYD) ===

The first youth leader on a national level was Elder M.C. Green. In 1917, the YPWW was officially organized under the leadership of Elder Ozro Thurston Jones Sr., who in 1928 established the first Youth Congress bringing together youth leaders and workers on a national level. He began production of the&quot; YPWW Quarterly Topics&quot; to train the youth of the COGIC in the faith, doctrine, and polity of the church. YPWW became a distinctive trademark for COGIC and the principle training institute usually meeting on Sunday night prior to evening worship services. For a brief period of time, the YPWW Congress was combined with the Sunday School Congress in a joint convention until 1951. The Youth Congress eventually become one of the largest conventions in COGIC. Other leaders of the Youth Department who leader became influential leaders of the church included: Bishop F.D. Washington, Bishop Chandler D. Owens, Bishop Brandon B. Porter, and Bishop J. Drew Sheard. To be consistent with progressive measures and modernization, in the Nineties, the international church along with many local COGIC churches began to use the term &quot;youth department&quot; instead of &quot;YPWW. &quot; Today, the International Youth Department (IYD) is led by the International Youth President, Superintendent Nathaniel Green of Dallas, TX, and the International Chairlady, Evangelist Vandalyn Kennedy of Queens, NY.

=== Missions Department ===
Missions work in COGIC began under Elder Searcy in 1925. In 1926, upon the recommendation of Mother Lizzie Roberson, Elder C. G. Brown of Kansas City Missouri, was appointed the first Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the Home and Foreign Missions Department by Bishop C. H. Mason. The Elders&#x27; Council met and organized the first Missions board of the Church of God in Christ. In 1927, the call was made for workers to go to serve the Lord in foreign lands. Mrs. Mattie McCaulley of Tulsa, Oklahoma was the first to respond, and was sent to Trinidad. Thereafter, missionaries were sent to Africa and the islands of the Caribbean, Asia, and elsewhere. Military chaplains have also been instrumental in spreading COGIC through military installations. In November 1975, at the National Holy Convocation in Memphis, TN., with the consent of the General Board, Bishop Carlis Moody Sr. of Evanston, Illinois, was appointed by Bishop J. O. Patterson to be president of the Department of Home and Foreign Missions. Bishop Carlis Moody immediately began to reorganize the Missions Department, giving new guidelines. President Moody also added these ministries to the Missions Department:
#Youth on a Mission (YOAM) – a ministry of young people visiting the mission field to serve each summer.
#Student Aid – a ministry of support to foreign students.
#Touch a Life – child support ministry
#Nurses Aid Ministry – nurses taking their skills to the mission field.
#Sister Church Support Ministry – a church in the USA giving support to a church on the mission field.
#The Voice of Missions – a bimonthly magazine

Today COGIC has more than 12,000 churches, and several schools, missions, and medical clinics in more than eighty nations, including every inhabited continent. The church is thought to have nearly two million members in 7,000 churches on the continent of Africa. The church has more than 3,000 churches in Asia, and 2,000 churches in the Caribbean and South America. The fastest growing areas include Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, and India. Nigeria alone has 19 bishops and more than 2000 churches. The international membership of COGIC is estimated be between one and three million adherents. In 2015, after more than 40 years of faithful service, Bishop Carlis L. Moody was emeritized as Bishop of Missions. The current president of the Missions Department is Bishop Terence Paul Rhone of California and Prelate for Brazil First Jurisdiction.

===Evangelism Department===
The Department of Evangelism was officially organized on a national level by Overseer L.C. Page in 1927. The spread of COGIC was due largely to the efforts of its evangelists through crusades and revivals. Male as well as female evangelists were instrumental in spreading COGIC throughout the United States as well as around the world. The first meeting was held in Memphis, Tennessee around 1937. The early conventions of the Evangelist Board were basically crusades led by Page and a few other Evangelists from across the country. In 1981, Bishop J.O. Patterson appointed Dr. Edward Lee Battles President of the Department of Evangelism. During his administration, Battles organized Regions to oversee evangelistic ministry in various regional areas across the country. He also instituted the Annual Prayer Breakfast, conducted Evangelistic Crusades across the country and developed the Church of God in Christ National Evangelist Registry. Battles served as president until his death in December 1996.

In 1997, Bishop Chandler D. Owens appointed Evangelist Richard &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; White as president of the Department of Evangelism. He continued to build on the department through expansion of the Regional Administration into 10 geographical locations across the country. He appointed regional presidents to serve as liaisons to the jurisdictional presidents. Of special note is Evangelist Reatha Herndon who served as the International Elect Lady of the Department of Evangelism from 1951 to 2001. Mother Lillian Coffey appointed Mother Reatha Herndon as president of the National Women&#x27;s Evangelist Board in 1951. Herndon and her twin sister Leatha were pioneers of the evangelistic work of the Church of God in Christ. Together they traveled across the country proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ. They were also instrumental in establishing 75 churches across the nation. Pastor Dennis Martin and Superintendent Willie James Campbell succeeded Bishop White as presidents. The current president of the Department of Evangelism is Bishop Elijah Hankerson III of St. Louis, Missouri. In 2017, Presiding Bishop Charles E. Blake appointed gospel artist and Evangelist Dr. Dorinda Clark Cole of Detroit, Michigan as the Elect Lady. Her predecessor was Evangelist Dr. Rita Womack of Los Angeles, California.

=== Music Department ===
Pentecostals have been known and continue to be known for their lively worship, exuberant expressions of praise and worship, and musical compilations, mostly relying on congregational singing of hymns and chants. The COGIC emphasized the use of the choir as an integral part of the worship experience. From the very beginning of gospel music, COGIC members have influenced its rise. In the 1920s, Arizona Dranes, a blind Evangelist Missionary became one of the first gospel artists to bring the musical styles of COGIC to the public in her records for Okeh and performances. Later, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, ironically known as the &quot;godmother of Rock and Roll,&quot; expanded and highlighted the COGIC sound to the greater American public in the 1930s and 1940s. Evangelist Goldia Haynes, Elder Utah Smith, Madame Earnestine Washington, and Marion Williams continued COGIC&#x27;s influence throughout the fifties and sixties. Mrs. Anna Broy Crockett Ford was the first organizer and director of the National Music Department, which was formally established in November 1949.

==== Dr. Mattie Moss Clark ====
COGIC became a staple of gospel music under the guidance and leadership of Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. (1972–1994). She revolutionized and reorganized the music ministry to become a leading department in the church. She developed the role of the State Minister of Music and traveled the world conducting seminars and workshops perfecting the quality of choir music, their performance, appearance and demeanor, and the COGIC sound. Under her leadership and tenure, COGIC choirs and individual singers came to dominate gospel music producing a number of recordings and gospel hits. She formed her daughters into a singing group who became known as the legendary &quot;Clark Sisters&quot; who helped introduce and became leaders of the contemporary gospel music era. In 1982 during the Seventy-Fifth Holy Convocation, the diamond jubilee of the church, COGIC published its own hymnal, &quot;Yes, Lord!&quot;, which included many arrangements and songs written by COGIC and African American musicians and songwriters. She is the longest serving president of the International Music Department and her influence and legacy have been indelible and are recognized around the world.

==== Influence of COGIC on gospel music ====
Well-known gospel musicians with COGIC roots include; Andrae Crouch and Sandra Crouch, Walter Hawkins and Edwin Hawkins, Tramaine Hawkins, Rubenstein McClure, Yvette Flunder, Sara Jordan Powell, Daryl Coley, BeBe and CeCe Winans, The Winans, &quot;Detroit&quot; Gary Wiggins, John P. Kee, The O&#x27;Neal Twins, Vanessa Bell Armstrong, Rance Allen, Rev. Timothy Wright, Myrna Summers, Rev. James Moore, Thomas Whitfield (singer), Deniece Williams, Hubert Powell, Donnie McClurkin, LaShun Pace, The Anointed Pace Sisters, Dr. Bettye Ransom Nelson, Bishop Richard &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; White, Bishop Paul S. Morton, The Clark Sisters: (Jacky Clark-Chisholm, Elbernita &quot;Twinkie&quot; Clark, Dorinda Clark-Cole and Karen Clark-Sheard). COGIC continues to influence gospel music with a new generation of artists with COGIC roots that include: Kim Burrell, Ivan Powell, Doobie Powell, Kierra Sheard, J. Moss, Micah Stampley, Kurt Carr, Ricky Dillard, Kelly Price, Mary Mary Erica Campbell (musician) and Tina Campbell (musician), Tamela Mann, Dr. Gennie Ruth Cheatham Chandler, Earnest Pugh, Jonathan McReynolds, Jabari Johnson, DuShawn Washington, Instrumentalists: Dr. Vernard Johnson (saxophonist), Samuel Murrell (violinist) and Terrance Curry (trombonist), D&#x27;Extra Wiley (II D Extreme) and Michelle Williams (Destiny&#x27;s Child). The current leader of the International Music Department is recording artist Dr. Myron Williams, succeeding Dr. Judith Christie McAllister of Los Angeles, California, who is also a praise and worship national recording artist. Former International Music Department President Professor Iris Stevenson-McCullough (originally from Rochester, NY) is a major influence in the gospel music industry around the world.

=== United National Auxiliary Conference (UNAC) and Auxiliaries in Ministry (AIM) ===
As COGIC continued to grow, the various departments began the practice of convening annually to conduct the business unique of their ministries. The YPWW department began in 1928 with the convening of its first Youth Congress. Then in 1946, the YPWW Department was combined with the Sunday School Department for joint conventions until 1951 when they were separated once again. Each department convened its own convention in various cities through 1975. In 1976, under the leadership of Bishop J.O. Patterson Sr., the five major departments of COGIC were united under an umbrella convention known as UNAC-5 (United National Auxiliary Convention). Dr. Roy L.H. Winbush was selected to serve as the first chairman. In 1992, during the Ford administration, UNAC was disbanded in favor of three separate conventions namely: the International Sunday School Convention, the MY Convention (Music and Youth) and the ME Convention (Missions and Evangelism) again meeting in separate cities.. However, in 1996, the umbrella format was revised under the administration of Bishop C.D. Owens and became known as AIM (Auxiliaries in Ministry). Bishop J.W. Macklin was selected as the first chairman. This convention brings thousands of COGIC members representing all the major departments including Sunday School, Missions, Evangelism, Music, and Youth together in July and meets in cities around the U.S. The current chairman of AIM is Bishop Linwood E. Dillard of Memphis, TN.

== Educational institutions ==
In 1918, COGIC opened its first institution of higher learning, the Saints Industrial and Literary School in Lexington, Mississippi, for both girls and boys. In keeping with the times, the school had some industrial education and training for its students, so that they could learn practical skills. It also increasingly stressed high academic standards so that its graduates could go to normal school or college, especially to teach other African Americans. Education was considered key to advancement of the race. As public education was segregated and underfunded by white officials in the South through most of the tenure of the first major leader, this school became a destination for parents wanting their children to have high-quality education. Two other institutions associated with COGIC were also established, Page Normal and Industrial School in Hearne, TX and the Geridge School in Geridge, Arkansas.

Saints Industrial School enjoyed its greatest growth and success under the leadership of Dr. Arenia Conella Mallory (1904–1977). Bishop Mason appointed her as a young woman to be head of the small school in 1926, after she had been teaching there. She led its expansion and emphasized high academic standards, disciplined behavior, and prayer. She also established a musical program. She established a high school and gained accreditation for it, and then for the junior college which she founded on campus. By that time, it was known as Saints Academy and Junior College. During her leadership, several new buildings were constructed on the 350-acre campus to serve this expansion. African American parents sent their children to this school from across the United States, especially those who had grown up in Mississippi and knew its reputation. Mallory retired in 1976 after fifty years of service; and she had a national reputation. Known for the achievements of her students and school alumni, she had also served during these years, by invitation and appointment, on national federal commissions and with noted African American women&#x27;s groups.

The school closed in 1977 after her death, as it struggled financially in a period when some families were choosing integrated schools for their children. It was reopened in the early 1990s under the administration of Bishop L.H. Ford, as Saints&#x27; Academy, a private co-educational grade school. The school and college remain closed at present.

In 1968, COGIC established the C.H. Mason Theological Seminary to train its ministers and ministry leaders. Today COGIC operates the All Saints Bible College in Memphis, the C. H. Mason system of bible colleges, and the C. H. Mason Theological Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia. The seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools (ATS) and is part of a consortium of the Interdenominational Theological Center.

<doc id="222716" wikidata="Q6577042" url="?curid=222716" title="List of chief governors of Ireland">
<text>The office of [[chief governor of Ireland]] existed under various names from the 12th-century Anglo-Norman invasion to the creation of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922. Common names were (Chief) justiciar (13th–14th centuries); (King&#x27;s) lieutenant (14th–16th century); (Lord) Deputy (15th–17th centuries), and Lord Lieutenant (standard after 1690). The unofficial term Viceroy was also common.

Reasons for difficulty in stating terms of office include that many left the office empty for a period (sometimes to return to the Court of St. James&#x27;s, sometimes to return to their British estates) before either being replaced or returning. There is difficulty in getting clear information before 1529; in the earlier years, there were frequent long vacancies, during which a Lord Deputy or Lord Justice would act as chief governor. The Irish Act of Union merged the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The new United Kingdom came into being on 1 January 1801 resulting in the disappearance of the separate Irish Parliament: Though many expected the office of Lord Lieutenant to be abolished, it survived. Periodic debates throughout the nineteenth century erupt over whether it should be replaced by a &#x27;Secretary of State for Ireland&#x27;. The office of Chief Secretary for Ireland (in effect number two in Irish government ranking) grew in importance, with the Lord Lieutenant gradually reduced to a largely though not completely ceremonial role.

The office was replaced by the Governor-General of the Irish Free State. In Northern Ireland the position was replaced by that of Governor of Northern Ireland.

<text>The Sydney Conservatorium of Music (SCM) — formerly the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music, and known by the moniker &quot;The Con&quot; — is the music school of the University of Sydney. It is one of the oldest and most prestigious music schools in Australia, founded in 1915 by Belgian conductor and violinist Henri Verbrugghen. 

The heritage-listed main building of the Conservatorium — the Greenway Building — is located within the Royal Botanic Gardens on Macquarie Street on the eastern fringe of the Sydney central business district. It also has teaching at the main campus of the University in Camperdown/Darlington, at the Seymour Centre and eventually the Footbridge Theatre. 

The Greenway Building is also home to the community-based Conservatorium Open Academy and the Conservatorium High School. In addition to its secondary, undergraduate, post-graduate and community education teaching and learning functions, the Conservatorium undertakes research in various fields of music. The Building was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 January 2011.

== History ==
The land originally belonged to the Aboriginal people, called the &quot;Eora&quot;, who lived around Sydney coast. They lived off the land by relying on its natural resources including the rich plants, birds, animals and marine life surrounding the Harbour within what is now the City of Sydney local government area the traditional owners are the Cadigal and Wangal bands of the &quot;Eora&quot;. There is no written record of the name of their language spoken and currently, there are debates as to whether these people spoke a separate language or a dialect of the Dharug language.

Governor Arthur Phillip arrived in 1788 with a pre-fabricated building which was assembled as his Government House, now partially on the current site of the Museum of Sydney and partially under Bridge Street. In its varied additions and permutations, it survived as the Sydney residence of the Governor until completion of the new Government House.

Governor Lachlan Macquarie took control of the colony in 1810 using that building as his Sydney residence. On 18 March 1816, he reported that he had postponed any changes to convert Sydney Government House into adequate accommodation. He noted the poor condition of the building saying that &quot;All the Offices, exclusive of being in a decayed and rotten State, are ill Constructed in regard to Plan and on Much too Small a Scale; they now exhibit a Most ruinous Mean, Shabby Appearance. No private Gentleman in the Colony is so Very ill Accommodated with Offices as I am at this Moment, Not having Sufficient Room to lodge a Very Small Establishment of Servants; the Stables; if possible, are still worse than the other Offices, it having been of late frequently Necessary to prop them up with Timber Posts to prevent it falling, or being blown down by the Winds.&quot; He noted that he wished to erect a new Government House and Offices in the Domain as soon as the Barracks was complete at the expense of the Police Fund.

The then Secretary for the Colonies, Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst, soon responded, writing on 30 January 1817 that he needed to see a plan and estimate of costs before he could approve the erection. In 1817, Macquarie resumed the sites of a bakehouse and mill on the proposed site. On 4 July 1817, he instructed a former convict, Francis Greenway, to prepare plans of offices and stables. Work commenced on the stables on 9 August 1817. Macquarie replied to Bathurst on 12 December that he was disappointed with the lack of approval, but claimed that no construction had commenced due to heavy rains. Macquarie laid the foundation stone for the stables on 16 December 1817.

Though Francis Greenway was the designer, it was not solely his work. In December 1819, Greenway noted that Macquarie saw the elevation before work began, but that his wife Elizabeth Macquarie gave him details of the number of rooms needed so that he could make a suitable plan. By 1819, according to Greenway, the stables were virtually planned though the barn in the range had become a stable. It then held 30 horses plus the stallions in the octagonal Towers. He estimated the cost of the stables to be . In a letter to the Australian of 28 April 1825, he identified Thornbury Castle as his model. A relative of Macquarie&#x27;s wife, Archibald Campbell, had been a pioneer of the Gothic architectural style in the late 18th century when he erected Inveraray Castle and it may have had a greater influence on the design by Greenway. Yet on 7 February 1821, Major Druitt reported that Governor Macquarie had not liked the ornamentation of the towers and the rich Cornish around the battlements.

It was not until 24 March 1819 that Macquarie informed the Colonial Office that he had commenced building the stables, in contravention of a firm order from Bathurst. &quot;I had so long Suffered such very great Inconvenience from the want of a Secure Stables for my Horses and decent sleeping places for my Servants, that I had been under the Necessity of building a regular Suite of Offices of this Description in a Situation Contiguous to and sufficiently Convenient for the present Old Government House, and also in one that will equally suit any New Government House that my Successors may he hereafter Authorised to Erect. These Stables are built on a Commodious tho&quot; not expensive Plan, and I expect they will be Completed in about three Months hence.&#x27; Horses were prized possessions and very valuable. They needed to be protected from the weather and made secure from thieves. Early in 1819 Lt John Watts was sent from England with plans and estimates, but these do not appear to have serviced.

On 26 September 1819, Commissioner John Thomas Bigge arrived in the colony to report the effectiveness of transportation to NSW as a publishment for criminals. He was soon examining Macquarie&#x27;s program of public works and his policy of fostering former criminals to fill positions of authority. Bigge objected to the construction of the stables in October 1819 but noted that the work was so far advanced that to halt it would be a waste.

An 1820 plan held at the Mitchell Library is not a construction plan, but seem to show it in its finished state. It depicted the towers as accommodation for servants, plus a dairy next to one of the coach houses and accommodation for a dairy maid, cowman and lodge keeper.

Architect Henry Kitchen was highly critical of the stables in evidence to Bigge on 29 January 1821 saying it was extravagant whilst not providing the accommodation needed. He described it as an &quot;incorrect attempt in the style of the castellated Gothic&quot; with an area 174 feet by 130 feet housing 28 horses, [plus coach houses cow house and servant&#x27;s quarters. The stables were complete in February 1821.

Greenway is better known for his Georgian designs but he also created a number of buildings in the Gothic model. Of these, Forts Philip and Macquarie, Dawes Point Battery and the Parramatta Road Toll-gate have all been demolished. Only the Government House Stables survives of his Gothic buildings.

After Macquarie&#x27;s return to Britain in 1821, the Stables had mixed uses. On 25 May 1825, Governor Thomas Brisbane suggested to Earl Bathurst that the &#x27;Gothic Building on the pleasantest side of the Scite of the Domain, which was intended for a Government Stables, is utterly useless at present from the great disproportion of the Establishment of the Government, may be advantageously improved into a Government residence.&#x27; On 30 June 1825, Earl Bathurst permitted Governor Ralph Darling to erect a new Government House or to convert the Stables into one though the estimates of costs would have to be sent to Britain for approval. Late in 1825, Brisbane had loaned the stables to the Australian Agricultural Company to temporarily house its livestock after it arrived.

There are a number of artists&#x27; views of the stables. This derived from its position overlooking the harbour as part of a vista of Sydney. It also acknowledged the stables as a piece of Gothic architecture, both romantic and picturesque. Even more to the point, it highlighted its role as a &quot;folly&quot; in a managed landscape.

The stables remained under utilised. Governor Richard Bourke sought approval in February 1832 to erect a new Government House near the stables by selling some of the Domain to raise funds. He also suggested that rooms in the stables could accommodate some of the Government House servants.

At an inquiry into the building of the new Government House in 1836, Colonel George Barney originally suggested converting the stables into offices but later changed his mind to recommend demolition. Construction of the new Government House from 1837 finally ensured that another building overshadowed the stables. After the erection of the New Government House, the stables were used to accommodate staff and horses.

Panoramic views form the top of the Garden Palace Exhibition building taken in 1881 by Charles Bayliss are the only known views of the internal courtyard and layout of the stables. Additions were made to the north side in the late 1870s or early 1880s.

By about 1910, the building&#x27;s role as a horse stables and staff accommodation was ending due to the increasing use of motor cars. In 1912 the government declared the building would become a museum whilst the Minister for Public Instruction suggested it as an Academy of Fine Arts but the proposal turned into a specialist Conservatorium of Music.

From 1913 to 1915, work to convert it into a conservatorium to the design of R. Seymour Wells from the Government Architect&#x27;s Office was undertaken, including the construction of a roof over the courtyard and the construction of a large auditorium. A new entrance of a cantilevered concrete awning was created and the former one removed. The windows and doors were altered considerably, though the castellated stuccoed exterior remained. The conservatorium auditorium was officially opened on 6 April 1915.Henri Verbrugghen was appointed as director on 20 May 1915 and teaching began on 6 March 1916. The site was formerly dedicated with an area of 3 roods 20 perches for a conservatorium of music on 22 December 1916 but was revoked on 2 November 1917 for an enlarged area of 3 roods 31 perches. The Conservatorium High School commenced in 1919.

After consideration of various proposals to increase accommodation, the Carr Labor government decided to rebuild on the site in 1995. The enlarged building designed by NSW Government Architect Chris Johnson and the private partnership of Daryl Jackson, Robin Dyke and Robert Tanner was completed in 2001. Construction proceeded in tandem with a major archaeological investigation of the site of the extensions. Deep excavation around the original core of the building allowed the needs of accommodation be met while preserving views to the site. Technological solutions such as separating the building shell from the surrounding sandstone and resting much of the extensions on rubber pads allowed the special acoustic needs of the Conservatorium to be met despite its proximity to the Cahill Expressway and the underground railway line. The work won an Australian Award for Urban Design Excellence in 2002.

===Origins of the conservatorium===

In 1915 the NSW Government under William Holman allocated £22,000 to the redevelopment of the stables into a music school. The NSW State Conservatorium of Music opened on 6 March 1916 under the directorship of the Belgian conductor and violinist Henri Verbrugghen, who was the only salaried staff member. The institution&#x27;s stated aims were &quot;providing tuition of a standard at least equal to that of the leading European Conservatoriums&quot; and to &quot;protect amateurs against the frequent waste of time and money arising from unsystematic tuition&quot;. The reference to European standards and the appointment of a European director was not uncontroversial at the time, but criticism soon subsided. By all accounts, Verbrugghen was hugely energetic: Joseph Post, later himself to be director, described him as &quot;a regular dynamo, and the sort of man of whom you had to take notice the moment he entered the room&quot;. Enrolments in the first year were healthy with 320 &quot;single-study&quot; students and a small contingent of full-time students, the first diploma graduations occurring four years later. A specialist high school, the Conservatorium High School was established in 1918, establishing a model for music education across the secondary, tertiary, and community sectors which has survived to this day.

Verbrugghen&#x27;s impact was incisive but briefer than had been hoped. When he put a request to the NSW Government that he be paid separate salaries for his artistic work as conductor of the orchestra (by then the NSW State Orchestra) and educational work as director of the conservatorium, the government withdrew its subsidies for both the orchestra and the string quartet that Verbrugghen had installed. He resigned in 1921 after taking the Conservatorium Orchestra to Melbourne and to New Zealand.

The conservatorium was home to Australia&#x27;s first full-time orchestra, composed of both professional musicians and conservatorium students. The orchestra remained Sydney&#x27;s main orchestra for much of the 1920s, accompanying many artists brought to Australia by producer J. C. Williamson, including the violinist Jascha Heifetz, who donated money to the Conservatorium library for orchestral parts. However, during the later part of the stewardship of Verbrugghen&#x27;s successor, W. Arundel Orchard (director 1923–34), there were tensions with another emerging professional body, the ABC Symphony Orchestra, later to become the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, driven by the young, ambitious and energetic Bernard Heinze, Director-General of Music for the federal government&#x27;s new Australian Broadcasting Commission.
In 1935, under Edgar Bainton (director 1934–48), the Conservatorium Opera School was founded, later performing works such as Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot;, Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, and Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, among others. Under Sir Eugene Goossens (Director 1948–55), opera at the conservatorium made a major contribution to what researcher Roger Covell has described as &quot; the most seminal years in the history of locally produced opera...&quot;. Although the most prominent musician to have held the post of director, Goossens&#x27; tenure was not without controversy. 

===Expansion and reforms===
Under the direction of Rex Hobcroft (1972–82), the Conservatorium adopted the modern educational profile recognised today. Hobcroft&#x27;s vision of a &quot;Music University&quot; was realised, in which specialised musical disciplines including both classical and jazz performance, music education, composition and musicology enriched each other.

In 1990, as part of the Dawkins Reforms, the Conservatorium amalgamated with the University of Sydney, and was renamed the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.

A 1994 review of the Sydney Conservatorium by the University of Sydney resulted in a recommendation that &quot;negotiations with the NSW State Government about permanent suitable accommodation for the Conservatorium be pursued as a matter of urgency.&quot;

As in 1916, a wide range of sites were considered, many of them controversial. In May 1997, 180 years after Governor Macquarie laid the foundation stone for the Greenway Building, State Premier Bob Carr announced a major upgrade of the Conservatorium, with the ultimate goal of creating a music education facility equal to or better than any in the world. A team was assembled to work to that brief, resulting in a complex collaboration between various government departments (notably the Department of Education and Training and the Department of Public Works and Services), the Government Architect, US-based acoustic consultants Kirkegaard Associates, Daryl Jackson Robin Dyke Architects, the key users represented by the Principal and Dean of the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and the Principal of the Conservatorium High School, the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust and many others.
== Heritage listing ==

As at 15 July 2009, the Conservatorium of Music is of State Heritage significance because the former Government House Stables is a notable example of Old Colonial Gothick architecture. It is a rare surviving example of the work of noted ex-convict architect Francis Greenway in the Old Colonial Gothick style. Greenway was instrumental in Macquarie accomplishing Macquarie&#x27;s aim to transforming the fledgling colony into an orderly, well-mannered society and environment. It is the only example of a gothic building designed by Greenway still standing. The cost and apparent extravagance was one of the reasons Macquarie was recalled to Britain.

The Conservatorium building also has strong associations with Macquarie&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, an influential figure in moulding the colony into a more ordered and stylish place under her husband and with the assistance of Greenway.

Since the building was converted for use as a Conservatorium in 1916, it has been the core music education institution in NSW and has strong associations with numerous important musicians.

Sydney Conservatorium of Music was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 January 2011 having satisfied the following criteria:

* The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The Conservatorium of Music is of historic significance at a State level because when it was designed and built the building was a key element in Governor Lachlan Macquarie&#x27;s grand vision to make Sydney into an attractive, well designed city. The design was a result of Macquarie&#x27;s ideas with input from his wife Elizabeth and was executed by ex convict architect Frances Greenway. Greenway had a key role in implementing landmark elements of Macquarie&#x27;s designs for churches and public buildings. The Stables was the first stage of Macquarie&#x27;s plan for a New Government House and although this was not built, the Stables influenced the new Government House that was eventually built. After the building&#x27;s conversion to the Conservatorium of Music it has been the principal music education institution in the State from 1916 onwards and continues to fulfil its role in the building originally modified for this purpose.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

The Conservatorium of Music is of State heritage significance through its association with Governor Lachlan Macquarie who commissioned the work, his wife Elizabeth who strongly influenced the design and ex convict architect Francis Greenway who designed the building. On 30 March 1816 Greenway was appointed as the colony&#x27;s first &quot;Civil Architect&quot;, the forerunning position to the Government Architect. In its role as the principal music education institution in NSW for many years it has strong and significant association with noted musicians and administrators such as Henry Verbrugghen and Eugene Goossens who were Directors of the Conservatorium.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The Conservatorium building is of aesthetic significance at a State level as it is a notable exemplar of the Old Colonial Gothick Picturesque style of architecture in Australia. In addition it is the only surviving example of this style of architecture designed by Francis Greenway. Its strong symmetry, battlemented parapet walls, squat towers, pointed arch and square headed openings, label moulded over windows make the building an aesthetically distinctive example of Old Colonial Gothick Picturesque style.

The substantial size of the building for a stable, the use of the picturesque style and its location on the edge of the Governor&#x27;s Domain demonstrate the ambition of Governor Macquarie in creating order and style in the town of Sydney. Once complete and lacking its accompanying new Government House, it was a landmark &quot;folly&quot; in a managed landscape inspiring young artists and adding a touch of romance to a colony seen by British eyes as devoid of legend and antiquity.

The Conservatorium of Music continues to feature as a prominent landmark in the townscape and the Royal Botanic Gardens. It features as a focal point at the entry leading to Government House.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

The Conservatorium of Music is of State heritage significance for its association with generations of noted Australian musicians. It was and continues to be a focus for musical activity attracting visiting performers to perform in the auditorium

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The Conservatorium is of State heritage significance as its potential archaeological resource has not been exhausted despite extensive investigation. The results of archaeological investigations to date have revealed much about the early history and activity of the colony and many artefacts uncovered are displayed and interpreted in the new building.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Being the only surviving example of Francis Greenways design in the Old Colonial Gothic Picturesque style makes the Conservatorium of Music an rarity. It also appears to be the only extant stable block in the Sydney CBD which survives from the Macquarie period.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The Conservatorium is of State heritage significance as a fine example of Old Colonial Gothic Picturesque and demonstrates the principal elements of this style in its strong symmetry, battlemented parapet walls, squat towers, pointed arch and square headed openings, label moulded over windows.
=== Greenway Building ===
The Conservatorium of Music is a large building designed in the Early Colonial Gothic Picturesque style. Located on the western edge of the Royal Botanic Gardens, the building was originally designed to be the stables for the new Government House that Governor Macquarie hoped for but did not succeed in building. The stables were designed by Francis Greenway who was appointed as civil architect on 30 March 1816. Greenway may have taken some of his Gothic inspiration from his time working with John Nash in England, or from direction from Elizabeth Macquarie, who was well versed in architecture. Elizabeth&#x27;s cousin too had been an English pioneer of the Gothic Revival design and his work influenced her husband Governor Macquarie in his attempts to give the young colony some order and style.

The stables were designed as a castellated fort. As part of Macquarie&#x27;s scheme was to transform Sydney into an attractive city, the stables were intended as part of a picturesque landscape suitable for a gentleman&#x27;s residence that Macquarie envisaged around the Government House he wished to build. The construction is of masonry with a sandstone base below rendered walls. Squat towers mark the corners of the complex and divide the main elevation to mark the main entries to the building. The external walls are parapeted with battlements. The parapets to the towers have stylised machicolations below the cornice.

Entries are through wide pointed arch openings on the north and south sides. Ground floor windows are pairs of three pane casement sashes below a topflight. Label moulds frame the top of the ground floor window openings. The first floor has smaller single sash windows, most directly below the cornice mouldings. Small single sash windows are in the towers. Some windows, probably the original and reconstructed windows have sandstone reveals and margins. Others have rendered reveals and margins. Some original sandstone reveals survive, primarily on the east side. The main entries to the former stables have pointed arch openings.

The two storey ranges of rooms were arranged around a central courtyard. A few weals on the courtyard side of these ranges survive notably on the south side where they are left unrendered. The central courtyard was infilled and roofed over in 1913-1915 to house an auditorium as part of the conversion for the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. The new infill is a largely independent structure from the stables with rendered masonry walls supporting a hipped roof with ventilation gables at the east and west ends and topped by copper clad lanterns. Copper gutters are used with copper rainwater heads marked with the date 1914. Internally the building retains the general plan of the original with an outer ring of rooms around a corridor. The Verbruggen Hall is at the centre of the plan.

Basement level additions in 2001 provide a landscaped court on the east and north sides of the building. A new entry structure to the south of the former stables building connects the original stables to the basement additions.

Archaeological evidence of the roadway that led from First Government House to the stables has been conserved in the 2001 entry structure to the south of the original building. A water storage cistern dating from the 1790s remains in situ and the foundations of a mill and bakery owned by John Palmer remain under the floor of the Verbrugghen Hall. A collection of artefacts unearthed during the restoration works is housed in the conservatorium. The collection and in situ archaeology constitute part of this listing.

==== History ====
Originally commissioned in 1815 as the stables for the proposed Government House, the oldest conservatorium building was designed by the convict architect Francis Greenway. Listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register in the Gothic Picturesque architectural style with turrets, the building was described as a &quot;palace for horses&quot; and is a portrayal of the romantic vision of Governor Macquarie and the British architectural trends of the time. It is the only example of a gothic building designed by Greenway still standing. The cost and apparent extravagance was one of the reasons Macquarie was recalled to Britain. The stables, located close to picturesque Sydney Harbour, reflect the building techniques and the range of materials and skills employed during the early settlement era.

At the time of its listing on the State Heritage Register, the building was given the following statement of significance:
=== Condition ===

Although converted into a Conservatorium, a good deal of original fabric remains in a fair to good condition. Archaeological investigations that accompanied recent additions were extensive and included deep excavation around the building. Although subject to alteration to fit it out as a Conservatorium, a good deal of the original fabric remains extant and it is still perfectly legible as an Old Colonial Gothic building. Internally some of the original surfaces remain visible, though most have been covered to fit it out as a Conservatorium.

=== Modifications and dates ===
* Cantilevered awning added to the west side 1913-1915, removed 2001
* Openings reconstructed 2001
* Conservatorium extended with basement rooms and new entry on south side 2001
* Upper floor openings in larger bays between towers added 2001
* Verbrugghen Hall refitted 2001
* West entry converted to window 2001
* Extensive deep excavation around the Conservatorium for extensions and archaeological excavation 1998 - 2001 removed most of the archaeological evidence from the immediate surrounds of the site.

==Centenary commissions==
To mark the centenary of the Conservatorium in 2015, it commissioned 101 new works, the spread designed to represent those who have shaped music over the past 100 years. The first work in the series was John Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;Mr Tambourine Man&quot;, based on the poetry of Bob Dylan, which was presented on 11 September 2009.

==Leadership==
The past directors, principals and deans were:
== Students&#x27; Association ==
Both undergraduate and postgraduate students at the Conservatorium are represented politically and academically by the Conservatorium Students&#x27; Association. Founded in 1919 as the Conservatorium Students&#x27; Union, it oversees the majority of student culture for the school, and organises the annual Con Ball. 

The Association manages the Common Room and two turrets (one for their office and the other for storage) at the back of the Greenway Building. Merchandise for the Conservatorium is also sold by the Association. 

Elections for the Association occur annually in October, with the terms of the elected starting on 1 December. The current president is Alexander Poirier, the Vice-President is Cianna Walker, the Secretary is Theresa Xiao, and the Treasurer is Jacques Lombard.

<text>Faust (, English: &quot;fist&quot;) are a German rock band from Hamburg. Formed in 1971 by producer and former music journalist Uwe Nettelbeck, the group was originally composed of Werner &quot;Zappi&quot; Diermaier (b.1949), Hans Joachim Irmler (b.1950), Arnulf Meifert, Jean-Hervé Péron (b.1949), Rudolf Sosna (1946 – 1996) and Gunther Wüsthoff, working with engineer Kurt Graupner. Their work was oriented around dissonance, improvisation, and experimental electronic approaches, and would influence subsequent ambient and industrial music. They are considered a central act of West Germany&#x27;s 1970s krautrock movement.

==History==
===1971–1975===
Faust formed in 1971 in the rural setting of Wümme. They secured a recording contract with Polydor and soon began recording their debut, &quot;Faust&quot;, which sold poorly but received critical acclaim for its innovative approach and established a devoted fan base. Meifert was sacked shortly afterwards because, as Péron wrote in 2004, &quot;he discussed things, because he had flat buttocks and an absolutely beautiful girlfriend, because he practised every day, because he always kept his room neat and woke up every morning to first wet a cloth he&#x27;d put in front of his room to keep the dirt out, because he played such a hard 4/4th that we had to travel into the tongue, ready to drop, ding dong is handsome top.&quot;

In 1972 the band recorded its second, slightly more accessible album &quot;So Far&quot;. Faust became one of the premier bands in the international appreciation of the genre that would eventually be known as krautrock.

Faust became one of the first acts to sign to Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Records, who embarked on a marketing campaign somewhat daring for its time, aimed at introducing Faust to British record-buyers. &quot;The Faust Tapes&quot; was a cut-and-paste album, which spliced together a large number of bits and pieces from their extensive collection of private recordings not originally intended for release. Virgin issued it at the then price of a single, 48 pence. &quot;The Faust Tapes&quot; reportedly sold over 100,000 copies but its low price tag rendered it ineligible for a chart placing.

After collaborating with Tony Conrad on the album &quot;Outside the Dream Syndicate&quot;, Faust recorded &quot;Faust IV&quot; at Virgin&#x27;s studios in England. The band broke up in 1975 after Virgin rejected its fifth album (some of the recordings later appeared on the &quot;Munich and Elsewhere&quot; album), but reissues of their recordings and various additional material through Chris Cutler&#x27;s Recommended Records maintained a level of interest.
Faust experimented with the presentation of their early records. Their first album was originally released on clear vinyl, in a clear sleeve with an X-ray of a human fist silkscreened on the outer sleeve. Their second album, &quot;So Far&quot;, made extensive use of the color black, though inside the sleeve were sheets with a different illustration for each song. &quot;The Faust Tapes&quot; had a visually unsettling op art cover design by Bridget Riley, while that for &quot;Faust IV&quot; consisted of a series of blank music staves.

===1975–present: breakup, &quot;disappearance&quot; and reunion===

After Faust&#x27;s breakup, the group&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown; the Recommended Records catalogues talked about the group&#x27;s &quot;disappearance&quot;. The official Web site lists three concerts during the 1980s, and the &quot;Patchwork&quot; album, a compilation of outtakes, feature three snippets that were recorded in the 1980s, but apart from that, the group&#x27;s activities between 1975 and 1990 remain shrouded in mystery.

In 1990 and 1992, members Irmler, Diermaier and Péron reunited for performances. In 1994, Faust toured the United States for the first time, with Péron and Diermaier assisted by Steven Wray Lobdell and with members of Sonic Youth as an opening act. Irmler did not participate in the 1994 US tour, but took a more active role after that, producing the groups&#x27; records and releasing them on his Klangbad label. He also compiled and edited the &quot;Patchwork&quot; remix album in 2002. Sosna&#x27;s chronic alcoholism ended a brief reunion with Faust &quot;after four or five exhausting days&quot;, and he died on 10 November 1996. Gunter Wüsthoff has not taken part in any of the reunions. They have continued to perform in various combinations and with various additional musicians ever since, with Diermaier always behind the drum kit.

In 1996, Diermaier and Péron met Olivier Manchion and Amaury Cambuzat from French group Ulan Bator. They performed for the first time together as &quot;Collectif Met(z)&quot; in November 1996 (this quartet became the basis of a later Faust line-up and this concert was part of a 2005 release). A few days after, Faust performed at the Garage in London and at the Transmusicales de Rennes, featuring Chris Cutler. After two studio albums, Péron left the group in June 1997. From mid-1997 to 2004, Faust toured as Zappi W. Diermaier, Hans Joachim Irmler, Steven Wray Lobdell, Lars Paukstat and Michael Stoll, releasing many more studio and live albums.
Diermaier and &quot;art-errorist&quot; Péron reunited in 2005, when Zappi proposed that they start a &quot;new&quot; Faust together with Olivier Manchion and Amaury Cambuzat from Ulan Bator. Faust now exists in two completely different incarnations, both active and each reflecting different aspects of the original group. Uwe Nettelbeck died on 17 January 2007.

Diermaier/Péron&#x27;s new Faust made their debut at the 2005 Art-Errorist Avant Garde festival in Schiphorst, Germany, where they also presented a new release entitled &quot;Collectif Met(z)&quot;, a collection including concerts from 1996 and 2005 and unreleased solo songs. They also recorded &quot;Trial and Error&quot;, released on DVD in 2007 by the Fuenfundvierzig Label. This incarnation of the group has been extremely active, releasing several CD-Rs and DVD-Rs and touring extensively, including a very successful autumn 2005 UK tour, released in 2007 as &quot;... In Autumn&quot; by Dirter. This release also features ex Henry Cow saxophonist/flautist Geoff Leigh, vocalist Lucianne Lassalle, poet Zoë Skoulding and the members of the Welsh group Ectogram. The trio of Diermaier, Péron and Cambuzat performed at a Rock in Opposition festival in France in April 2007. This trio lineup also recorded a new album entitled &quot;Disconnected&quot; which was mixed by Steven Stapleton and Colin Potter of Nurse with Wound. It was released to tie in with the 2007 Schiphorst Avant Garde festival in July 2007. &quot;C&#x27;est com... com... compliqué&quot;, the second album from these sessions was released in February 2009 on the Bureau B label. &quot;Krautrock: The Rebirth of Germany&quot; (2009), BBC documentary on Krautrock, featured interview segments with Péron and Diermaier. In 2011, in collaboration with the British artists Geraldine Swayne and James Johnston, the duo recorded a new Faust studio album, &quot;Something Dirty&quot;.
In 2010, Faust with members Hans Joachim Irmler, Steven Wray Lobdell, Lars Paukstat, Michael Stoll and Jan Fride released a new studio album, &quot;Faust Is Last&quot;, which happened to be the last studio album by Irmler&#x27;s Faust. After the release of the two compilations &quot;Momentaufnahme 1&quot; and &quot;Momentaufnahme 2&quot;, Jean-Hervé Péron declared the band disbanded, which Diermaier later denied. Having been absent from the band for 49 years, core member Gunther Wüsthoff reunited with Werner &quot;Zappi&quot; Diermaier to play on the new 2022 Faust album, &quot;Daumenbruch&quot;. Members of Einsturzende Neubauten and Monobeat Original, another musical project of Diermaier, also play on the album.

In September 2024, Faust released a new six track album titled &quot;Blickwinkel&quot;, once again created by the reunited efforts of Diermaier and Wüsthoff, working with a selection of musical friends.

==Collaborations==
During the Wümme years, Diermaier, Péron and Wüsthoff played on Slapp Happy&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Sort Of&quot; (1972) and &quot;Acnalbasac Noom&quot; (1973) which were also produced by Uwe Nettelbeck. Slapp Happy&#x27;s Peter Blegvad had played with Faust in Wümme and subsequently toured with them in the UK. That tour also featured Uli Trepte, who had performed with Guru Guru and Neu!.

In contrast with Slapp Happy&#x27;s song-based music, in 1972 Diermaier, Péron and Sosna also collaborated with the violinist Tony Conrad on &quot;Outside the Dream Syndicate&quot;; the record was released in 1973 at a low price in the UK and was, at the time, one of the few available examples of drone-based minimalism. A live recording from a 1995 concert, entitled &quot;Outside the Dream Syndicate Alive&quot; featuring Tony Conrad, Zappi Diermaier &amp; Jean-Hervé Péron of Faust and Jim O&#x27;Rourke was released in Autumn 2005.

Faust collaborated with New Jersey avant-garde hip-hop crew Dälek for the album &quot;Derbe Respect, Alder&quot; in 2004.

Jean-Hervé Péron collaborated with THEME and Zsolt Sores on a MLP called &#x27;Poison Is (Not) The Word&#x27; released on the Lumberton Trading Company label in 2012, and in 2013 Faust recorded &#x27;Live at Clouds Hill&#x27; with Omar Rodríguez-López.

Faust performed with Slapp Happy again in November 2016 at the Week-End festival in Cologne, Germany. The two groups also played together in February 2017 at Cafe Oto in London.

In December 2017, Faust recorded a one-off collaboration with erotic-electronic artist Natalie Sharp, aka Lone Taxidermist, as part of the BBC Radio 3 programme &quot;Late Junction&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Late Junction Sessions&quot; series.

<doc id="222737" wikidata="Q275535" url="?curid=222737" title="Jane Siberry">
<text>Jane Siberry ( ; ; born 12 October 1955) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, known for such hits as &quot;Mimi on the Beach&quot;, &quot;I Muse Aloud&quot;, &quot;One More Colour&quot; and &quot;Calling All Angels&quot;. She performed the theme song to the television series &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;. She has released material under the name Issa ( ) – an identity (as opposed to a simple stagename) which she used formally between 2006 and 2009.

On 30 August 2005, Siberry was awarded the 2005 Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award in music by the Canada Council for the Arts.

==Career history==
===Childhood and early years===
Jane Stewart was born in Toronto in 1955 and was raised in the suburb of Etobicoke. She would take her subsequent surname, &quot;Siberry&quot;, from the family name of her maternal aunt and uncle. Many years later, she would explain this choice by stating &quot;this woman and her husband were the first couple I met where I could feel the love between them and I held that in front of me as a reference point.&quot;

Siberry learned piano from the age of four, predominantly teaching herself and developing her own concepts of notation and structure. At school she learned conventional music theory (as well as French horn) and taught herself to play guitar by working through Leonard Cohen songs. Her first song was completed at the age of seventeen, although she had been developing song ideas since much earlier.

Following high-school graduation from Richview Collegiate in Etobicoke, Ontario, and then the Canadian Junior College, Lausanne, Switzerland, Siberry moved on to study music at the University of Guelph, later switching to microbiology (in which she gained a BSc degree) when she found freshman music courses to be stifling. She began performing in folk clubs in Guelph, linking up first with singer Wendy Davis and then with bass guitarist John Switzer in a group called Java Jive.

===First three albums and Canadian success (1979–1986)===
Following the split of Java Jive in 1979, Siberry maintained both a musical and a romantic relationship with John Switzer (who would work with her on her first four records). On leaving university, she supported her work as a solo performer by working as a waitress, earning enough to finance and tour her debut album, the folk-influenced &quot;Jane Siberry&quot;, which was released in 1981 on Duke Street Records. The album was relatively successful for an independent release, enabling Siberry to sign a three-album deal with A&amp;M Records via the Windham Hill label. As part of the deal, Siberry was able to release her albums on Duke Street Records in Canada while Windham Hill handled American release and distribution.

Assembling a backing band of Switzer, guitarist Ken Myhr, keyboard players Doug Wilde and Jon Goldsmith, and drummer Al Cross, Siberry recorded her second album &quot;No Borders Here&quot; (released in 1984) for which she mostly abandoned the folk approach in favour of electronic art-pop. This coincided with a growth in support of new wave and independent music within Canadian broadcast media, including the Toronto radio station CFNY and the video channel MuchMusic. Both of these became keen supporters of Siberry and put her onto high playlist rotation.

Siberry&#x27;s first hit was the &quot;No Borders Here&quot; track &quot;Mimi on the Beach&quot; – a seven-and-a-half-minute art-rock single which benefited from the art-friendly broadcast support at the time (and from its video made by Siberry and friends). Both factors earned it heavy MuchMusic and college radio play. Two further singles with videos – &quot;You Don&#x27;t Need&quot; and &quot;I Muse Aloud&quot; – consolidated the success. &quot;No Borders Here&quot; sold 40,000 copies and won Siberry a CASBY award for Best Female Vocalist, as well as giving her first opportunity to play live in New York.

Siberry&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Speckless Sky&quot; (1985), continued her art-pop approach. It was another commercial and critical success, going Gold in Canada by selling over 50,000 units and establishing Siberry as a Canadian pop star. The album provided another hit single, &quot;One More Colour&quot; (with a video featuring Siberry walking a cow) and won the 1985 CASBY for Best Album, with Siberry and Switzer also picking up the award for Best Producer. In 1986 Siberry signed with Warner Brothers subsidiary Reprise Records, which picked up her American contract from Windham Hill, while honouring the existing Canadian arrangement with Duke Street Records.

===Reprise Records period===
====&quot;The Walking&quot; and &quot;Bound By the Beauty&quot; (1987–1992)====
For her fourth album (her first for Reprise) Siberry created &quot;The Walking&quot;. Released in 1988, it contained a set of intricately structured songs, many of which were lengthy and shifted between narrative viewpoints and characters. Many of the songs dealt with romantic collapse and miscommunication, partially inspired by Siberry&#x27;s breakup with John Switzer (which happened during the writing and recording of the album). She was marketed as part of the &quot;high art&quot; end of rock music, alongside artists such as Kate Bush or Peter Gabriel. Siberry embarked on a tour of Europe and the United States to promote &quot;The Walking&quot;. This included her first European performance, which took place at the ICA in London.

In spite of the efforts of both label and artist, &quot;The Walking&quot; was ultimately less of a commercial success than &quot;The Speckless Sky&quot;, with Siberry failing to make her mainstream breakthrough. Although the album met with the same critical interest and attention as its predecessor, reviews were noticeably harsher and less welcoming. As well, the album was considered unsuitable by broadcasters for radio airplay, despite the presence of several shorter and more accessible tracks on the album (both the title track and a shorter edit of &quot;Ingrid and the Footman&quot; were released as singles but failed to make an impact).

Despite this setback, Reprise retained Siberry&#x27;s contract, even taking over the Canadian side of the distribution for her next album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Bound by the Beauty&quot;. Siberry moved towards more simple and direct song forms, jettisoning electronic art-pop in favour of more acoustic styles drawing on country and western and Latin music. While retaining her quirkier conceptual approach, the album&#x27;s song themes were generally more lighthearted than those of &quot;The Walking&quot;. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Siberry toured various folk festivals (in a duo format with Ken Mhyr on guitar) to reposition herself in the market; &quot;Bound by the Beauty&quot; had better record sales, and appeared on the RPM Top 100 Albums chart in 1989. In 1990, she embarked on a 50-date tour of Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the United States and Canada.

By 1991, Siberry had completed demos for her next album: however, this was scrapped when neither Reprise nor Siberry herself were happy with the results, which were deemed too much like &quot;Bound by the Beauty&quot;. In 1992, during the wait for a new record, Reprise released a Siberry compilation album called &quot;Summer in the Yukon&quot; for the UK market. This focussed primarily on her more pop-oriented side and featured a remix of the &quot;Bound by the Beauty&quot; track &quot;The Life is the Red Wagon&quot; with a new dance-friendly rhythm track.

====&quot;When I Was a Boy&quot; and &quot;Maria&quot; (1993–1996)====
Siberry&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot;, was completed in 1993 after a three-year writing and recording period during which she&#x27;d undergone changes in her personal life and in her musical approach. For the first time she chose to share album production responsibilities with other musicians – in this case Michael Brook and Brian Eno, both of whom also contributed instrumental work to the album. During the recording period, she had also confronted and overcome a longstanding alcohol addiction. She would later consider the music on the record to be more liberated, featuring what she described as &quot;more &quot;body&quot; in it, more sexual energy... it&#x27;s about the sacred aspects of sexuality, and finally being able to embrace them and not, em, (just) be an observer anymore.&quot;
In contrast to its predecessor, &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot; was influenced by funk, dance and gospel music and featured extensive use of layering and sampler technology, in line with developments in latterday pop music, trip-hop and R&#x27;n&#x27;B. It also featured what would become Siberry&#x27;s best-known song, &quot;Calling All Angels&quot; (a duet with k.d. lang which had first appeared as part of the soundtrack to Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;Until the end of the World&quot; and as a track on &quot;Summer in the Yukon&quot;; it was later re-recorded for the &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; soundtrack). Other contributors on the album included Canadian singers Holly Cole and Rebecca Jenkins and (for the last time) regular guitarist Ken Mhyr. The album introduced the more spiritually-oriented themes that became a hallmark of Siberry&#x27;s later work and launched three singles – &quot;Calling All Angels&quot;, &quot;Sail Across the Water&quot; and &quot;Temple&quot;.

Prior to the release of &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot;, Siberry performed in Edinburgh as the opening act for Mike Oldfield&#x27;s premiere of &quot;Tubular Bells 2&quot;. She met with a disastrous rejection by the audience. Initially, Siberry was devastated (later describing herself as having &quot;cried for two weeks&quot;) and had to make a serious reassessment of her perspective on her work. From this point onwards, she chose to reclaim her art for herself and decided &quot;I took back all the power back that I had put outside myself trying to please (others). The worst show of my life has become the best show because it&#x27;s given me the ultimate freedom to care only about what I think is really good. How my career does is secondary.&quot;

Siberry would subsequently reassert full control over all areas of her work, from songwriting to stage presentation and video direction. For her promotional tour for &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot; – which she called &quot;The &quot;It Ain&#x27;t a Concert&quot; Concert&quot;, she opted not to use a band and instead performed solo, encouraging audience interaction and including spoken-word material (to the puzzlement of critics).

Later in 1993, Siberry collaborated with Holly Cole, Rebecca Jenkins, Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara and Victoria Williams on a live concert of Christmas music, which was broadcast on CBC Radio on Christmas Day that year before being released in 1994 as the album &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot;.

During 1994 Siberry recorded sporadically, without constructing a new album. She came to the attention of a new audience when her song &quot;It Can&#x27;t Rain All the Time&quot; was included on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;The Crow&quot;; time spent with Peter Gabriel at Real World Studios resulted in three more songs (not released for another seven years) and she sang on the Indigo Girls album &quot;Swamp Ophelia&quot;.

Siberry&#x27;s next release was another complete change of direction. In contrast to the intricate studio production of &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot;, &quot;Maria&quot; (released in 1995) featured a more jazz-inspired direction with live acoustic instrumentation and approaches similar to Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. The basic tracks to the album were recorded in three days flat by a group featuring Tim Ray (pianist for jazz band Orange then Blue), Betty Carter&#x27;s double bass player Christopher Thomas, top jazz session drummer Brian Blade and trumpeter David Travers-Smith (with Siberry playing electric guitar and singing). She edited and reworked the recorded material into fully realized songs, most of which featured various perspectives on innocence. The album also featured a 20-minute extended conceptual work called &quot;Oh My My&quot;. Siberry took this new band on tour across Canada and the United States and professed herself pleased with the results, but Reprise Records were less pleased with the album sales.

After &quot;Maria&quot;, Siberry parted company with Reprise Records, later stating &quot;they wanted me to work with a producer and that severed any sense of loyalty. I realized they truly didn&#x27;t understand what I was doing... so I took my leave.&quot;

===Sheeba Records period===
====New York period (1996–1997)====
In 1996, Siberry founded her own Toronto-based independent label, Sheeba Records, on which she has released all of her subsequent material. Although her public profile became lower once she became an independent artist, she retained a devoted cult following. Her first Sheeba release was &quot;Teenager&quot; (1996), an album of songs which she had originally written during her teenage years and which she had recorded during the &quot;Maria&quot; sessions (taking advantage of the fact that the sessions had been completed with studio time left over). Leaving the Sheeba Records office to continue its work in Toronto, Siberry herself then relocated to New York City in search of new inspiration.

In 1996, she performed four concerts at the city&#x27;s famous Bottom Line jazz club – all of which were recorded and released on a set of live albums between 1997 and 1999, collectively known as the &quot;New York City Trilogy&quot;. The first of these was 1997&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, a double album which combined Christmas standards and carols (such as &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot;) and original Siberry songs containing religious imagery (such as &quot;An Angel Stepped Down...&quot;)

Siberry had also demonstrated the greater creative freedom she had as an independent recording artist via her other 1997 album, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. This was her most unconventional release to date – although it did feature song excerpts, it was predominantly a sound collage representation of a typical day&#x27;s experience by Siberry in New York. The album was filled with recordings of yoga classes, phone messages and street sounds; and featured conversations and exchanges with a wide variety of people – cab drivers, friends, fellow students and Siberry&#x27;s then-current musical collaborators Patty Larkin, Joe Jackson, k.d. lang and Darol Anger.

Also in 1997, Siberry&#x27;s former label Reprise Records released a second compilation album of her work, &quot;A Collection 1984–1989&quot;, aimed at the Canadian and American markets, and drew from the whole range of Siberry&#x27;s output prior to &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot;.

====Toronto period (1997–2005)====
With Sheeba running into financial problems, Siberry left New York, returned to Toronto and reestablished her label as a one-woman operation (handling everything from songwriting to envelope-stuffing). To finance Sheeba, she also began to experiment with what were then seen as unorthodox promotional ideas, such as the weekend-long &quot;Siberry Salons&quot; (a concert-cum-seminar featuring two performances plus a workshop and dinner, which were hosted at intimate and unusual venues such as art galleries and loft apartments). Sheeba now also sold soft toys and auctioned off collectible career-related items such as signed lyric sheets, her first guitar and even the pink bra which she had worn on the cover of &quot;Maria&quot;.

Siberry took two years to restore Sheeba&#x27;s precarious fortunes, during which she kept busy. Her first book of prose-poems, &quot;S W A N&quot;, was published by Sheeba in 1998, the same year that she toured as one of the acts on the female-oriented &quot;Suffragette Sessions&quot; tour, alongside Indigo Girls, Lisa Germano and members of Luscious Jackson and the Breeders. A second book, &quot;One Room Schoolhouse&quot;, followed in 1999. In the same year, Siberry released the second and third volumes of the New York concert recordings. &quot;&quot; was based around themes of communication (and included a &quot;Mimi&quot;-sung riposte to 1984&#x27;s &quot;Mimi on the Beach&quot;). &quot;&quot; documented a concert in which Siberry had sung songs linked by the concept of trees, as well as adding a couple of songs she&#x27;d contributed to film scores. The complete trilogy was reissued as a three album box set the same year.

Siberry&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Hush&quot; was released in 2000. This was a predominantly acoustic record consisting entirely of cover versions in which Siberry explored traditional American and Celtic folk and gospel songs such as &quot;Jacobs Ladder&quot;, &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; and &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;. She released a third book via Sheeba in 2000, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Baby&quot;. The following year&#x27;s &quot;City&quot; album compiled various non-album tracks, rarities and collaborations between Siberry and other musicians. As well as providing another home for &quot;Calling All Angels&quot;, the album included work with Nigel Kennedy, Peter Gabriel, Hector Zazou and Joe Jackson and featured &quot;All the Pretty Ponies&quot; (a children&#x27;s song which Siberry had contributed to the &quot;Barney&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; soundtrack).

In 2002, &quot;Love is Everything: The Jane Siberry Anthology&quot; was released on Rhino Records: a double-CD album combining material from her Duke Street, Reprise and Sheeba eras and summarizing the first twenty-one years of her career. This was followed in 2003 by &quot;Shushan the Palace: Hymns of Earth&quot; – another Christmas-themed album of cover versions. This time, Siberry performed her own interpretations of liturgical Christmas hymns by various classical and Romantic composers including Mendelssohn, Bach, Holst and Handel.

Despite her apparent productivity, Siberry was continuing to find her independent career and business efforts to be challenging and problematic. The live albums were in part an inexpensive tactic to enable her to gain resources to record her original work. She would later confess &quot;I really thought it was going to be much, much easier. The whole label thing. It wasn&#x27;t. Those records, &quot;Shushan&quot; and &quot;Hush&quot;, were to pay for studio time.&quot;

====&quot;Issa&quot; period (2006–2009)====
Early in 2006, Siberry closed her Sheeba office, then auctioned and sold nearly all of her possessions via eBay – including her Toronto home and her musical instruments. She retained one travelling guitar, but none of the other instruments featured on her albums and in her concerts. In 2006, she told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that she had kept a very few precious possessions, including her Miles Davis CDs, in storage.
On 3 June 2006, somewhere in northwestern Europe, Siberry changed her name to Issa: revealing this change of identity to the public a couple of weeks later on 24 June 2006. She told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that she chose the name Issa as a feminine variant of Isaiah. She stated that her older music would remain available for sale under the name &quot;Jane Siberry&quot;, but her new material would be released as Issa. 
At the time she also stated, regarding the change of identity, &quot;I had to do it right. I had to be serious about it and I had to convey that. When I put Jane away, I went silent for 24 hours. Not a word to anyone. And then Issa from that point on.&quot;

Later she would describe the process of choosing a new identity in terms of changing her writing approach – &quot;Moving into Issa, I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d be in the music business any more. I just started writing. I wanted to let go of any expectations and just try to get closer to what I heard in my head... I just tried to write as precisely as I could to what I heard in my head. I slowed everything down and took one note at a time, and just waited until I heard the next note.&quot; The process was evidently successful, resulting in thirty-three songs written in thirty-three days.

On 4 July 2006, Issa gave a lecture at University of British Columbia in Vancouver on the topic of &quot;Cracking the Egg: A Look from the Inside&quot;. She began with a poetic meditation on science and life, and then opened the floor up to questions from the audience. She talked about her recent adventures in decommodifying her life, her change in name, and her new conception of herself as an artist. Over 2006 and 2007, she documented the process of recording some thirty new songs in her journal, posted on her MySpace page and on her new website.

In autumn 2008 Issa finalized the ideas for a trilogy of albums to be called the &quot;Three Queens&quot; sequence. The first of these – &quot;Dragon Dreams&quot; – was the debut Issa release, on 12 December 2008. As with the previous Jane Siberry material, it was released on Sheeba: Issa had retained the label despite slimming down its operations. In 2009, Issa released the second album in the &quot;Three Queens&quot; trilogy, &quot;With What Shall I Keep Warm?&quot; However, it was plain that her identity was no longer fixed, as both of the names she&#x27;d used as a musician – &quot;Issa&quot; and &quot;Jane Siberry&quot; – were included on the cover. In December 2009, she notified her fans that she had recently changed her name from Issa back to Jane Siberry, feeling that the process of working under a different name had run its course.

====Later work (2010–present)====
Inspired by the dichotomy between frequent e-mails from devoted international fans asking her to play a concert in their city and her difficulty in finding a suitable concert promoter, Siberry launched a &quot;microtour&quot; through her fan mailing list in 2010, in which she offered to play small venues – ranging from intimate cafés to fans&#x27; own homes – in any location in Europe where one or more fans could organize a space, an audience of about 20 to 30 people and a night of accommodation.

In May 2010, Siberry made her entire back catalogue of music available as free downloads in MP3 and AIFF formats. She had previously employed a flexible pricing policy, stating &quot;I started feeling weird about holding back anything people wanted because of the money. It just felt wrong to my stomach, so I made a flexible interface so people could take it with whatever reasoning they felt was right, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it any more.&quot;

In March 2011, Siberry advised her fans through her mailing list that the third album of the &quot;Three Queens&quot; trilogy was almost ready (having been &quot;nearly completed&quot; several times before), and that she intended to release a fourth disc as part of the collection. The album, &quot;Meshach Dreams Back&quot;, was released later in 2011 and was the first album to be credited to &quot;Jane Siberry&quot; for eight years.

In 2014 Siberry used crowdfunding to raise funds to produce &quot;Ulysses&#x27; Purse&quot;, a limited edition CD. Siberry is featured in the Corey Hart single &quot;10,000 Horses&quot;, which was released on 8 April 2014.

==Musical style and commercial approach==
Siberry&#x27;s music is most commonly compared to artists such as Laura Nyro, Joni Mitchell, Kate Bush, Toyah Willcox, Anna Domino, Suzanne Vega and Laurie Anderson. She has drawn from a wide variety of styles, ranging from new wave rock on her earlier albums to a reflective pop style influenced by jazz, folk, gospel, classical and liturgical music in her later work. She has cited Van Morrison and Miles Davis as being strong creative influences.

Siberry has often criticized the competitive power of commercial radio and the recording industry. In 2005, she pioneered a self-determined pricing policy through her website on which the purchaser is given the choices of: standard price (about US$0.99/track); pay now, self-priced; pay later, self-priced; or &quot;a gift from Jane&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Siberry confirmed that since she had instituted the self-determined pricing policy, the average income she receives per song from Sheeba customers is in fact slightly &quot;more&quot; than standard price.

==Television performances==
Siberry performed &quot;Map of the World, Pt.1&quot; from her second album &quot;No Borders Here&quot; at the Juno Awards broadcast live on CBC Television on December 5, 1984. She was nominated as Best Promising Female Vocalist of the Year.

Siberry was the subject of two award-winning documentaries directed by Don Allan and produced by Bruce Glawson and Arnie Zipursky of Cambium Productions. The half-hour special, &quot;Jane Siberry, One More Colour&quot; premiered on CBC Television on March 27, 1987. It featured a concert taped at Montreal’s Le Spectrum club, with behind-the-scenes footage of the filming of the second version of her &quot;One More Colour&quot; music video directed by DEVO&#x27;s Gerald Casale. It also included Siberry touring in Los Angeles and San Francisco with singer Rebecca Jenkins, drummer Al Cross, guitarist Ken Myhr, singer Gina Stepaniuk, keyboardist Anne Bourne, bassist John Switzer, and manager Bob Blumer. The animated portrait of Siberry in the opening title sequence was designed by artist Donald Roberston. The half-hour special won the Gold Medal, Music Video Longform, at the &quot;International Film &amp; TV Festival of New York&quot; and the Silver Award for Music Promotion Tapes – Female Vocalist at the &quot;Houston International Film &amp; Festival&quot;, both in 1987.

&quot;Jane Siberry, I Muse Aloud,&quot; a one-hour special, premiered on TVOntario on October 19, 1987. The longer documentary had additional material directed by Michael McNamara, including Siberry recording her album &quot;The Walking&quot; in studio. The hour special won the Silver Medal for Popular Music &amp; Variety Entertainment Special at the &quot;International Film &amp; TV Festival of New York&quot; in 1987, the Gold Hugo Award for Variety/Entertainment – Television Production at the &quot;Chicago International Film Festival&quot; in 1988, and the &quot;Gemini Award&quot; for &quot;Best Editing in a Comedy, Variety or Performing Arts Program or Series&quot; in 1988.

Siberry was a featured artist in the one-hour special &quot;Standards&quot; produced by Jeremy Podeswa and Ingrid Veninger and directed by Podeswa. It premiered on Sunday Arts Entertainment on CBC Television in 1992. The special, which was inspired by David Ramsden’s &quot;Quiet Please! There’s a Lady on Stage&quot; also featured Cherie Camp, Holly Cole, Laura Hubert, Molly Johnson, Sarah McLachlan, Maggie Moore, and David Ramsden. Siberry performed Alberta Hunter’s &quot;The Love I Have For You&quot;.&quot;&quot;

Siberry appeared in the 1993 and 1994 Kumbaya Festivals, an HIV and AIDS benefit organized by Molly Johnson and telecast live on MuchMusic.

In 1994, Siberry sang to a live orchestral arrangement of &quot;Love is Everything&quot; in honour of Robert Lepage, the recipient of the National Arts Centre Award at the third annual Governor-General’s Performing Arts Awards. The television special of the Gala premiered on CBC Television on January 1, 1995.

<text>Flesh is any aggregation of soft tissues of an organism. Various multicellular organisms have soft tissues that may be called &quot;flesh&quot;. In mammals, including humans, &quot;flesh&quot; encompasses muscles, fats and other loose connective tissues, but sometimes excluding non-muscular organs (liver, lung, spleen, kidney) and typically discarded parts (hard tendon, brain tissue, intestines, etc.). More generally, it may be considered the portions of the body that are soft and delicate. In a culinary context, consumable animal flesh is called meat, while processed visceral tissues are known as offal. 

In particular animal groups such as vertebrates, molluscs and arthropods, the flesh is distinguished from tougher body structures such as bone, shell and scute, respectively. In plants, the &quot;flesh&quot; is the juicy, edible structures such as the mesocarp of fruits and melons as well as soft tubers, rhizomes and taproots, as opposed to tougher structures like nuts and stems. In fungi, &quot;flesh&quot; refers to trama, the soft, inner portion of a mushroom, or fruit body.

A more restrictive usage may be found in some contexts, such as the visual arts, where &quot;flesh&quot; may refer only to visibly exposed human skin, as opposed to parts of the body covered by clothing and hair. &quot;Flesh&quot; as a descriptor for colour usually refers to the non-melanated pale or pinkish skin colour of white humans, however, it can also be used to refer to the colour of any human skin.

In Christian religious circles, the flesh is a metaphor associated with .

<text>In linguistics, a participle (; abbr. ) is a nonfinite verb form that has some of the characteristics and functions of both verbs and adjectives. More narrowly, &quot;participle&quot; has been defined as &quot;a word derived from a verb and used as an adjective, as in a &quot;laughing face&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Participle&quot; is a traditional grammatical term from Greek and Latin that is widely used for corresponding verb forms in European languages and analogous forms in Sanskrit and Arabic grammar. In particular, Greek and Latin participles are inflected for gender, number and case, but also conjugated for tense and voice and can take prepositional and adverbial modifiers.

Cross-linguistically, participles may have a range of functions apart from adjectival modification. In European and Indian languages, the past participle is used to form the passive voice. In English, participles are also associated with periphrastic verb forms (continuous and perfect) and are widely used in adverbial clauses. In non-Indo-European languages, &#x27;participle&#x27; has been applied to forms that are alternatively regarded as converbs (see Sirenik below), gerunds, gerundives, transgressives, and nominalised verbs in complement clauses. As a result, &#x27;participles&#x27; have come to be associated with a broad variety of syntactic constructions.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;participle&quot; comes from classical Latin , from &#x27;sharing, participation&#x27;, because it shares certain properties of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The Latin grammatical term is a calque of the Greek grammatical term : &quot;metochē&quot;, &#x27;participation, participle&#x27;.

The linguistic term, &quot;past participle&quot;, was coined circa 1798 based on its participial form, whose morphology equates to the regular form of preterite verbs. The term, &quot;present participle&quot;, was first used circa 1864 to facilitate grammatical distinctions. Despite the taxonomical use of &quot;past&quot; and &quot;present&quot; as associated with the aforementioned participles, their respective semantic use can entail any tense, regardless of aspect, depending on how they are structurally combined.

== Forms ==
Some languages have extensive participial systems but English has only two participial forms, most commonly termed:
#past participle, which is regularly formed with an &quot;-ed&quot; suffix (e.g. &quot;looked&quot;, &quot;ended&quot;, &quot;tutored&quot;) but has numerous irregular forms (e.g. &quot;broken&quot;, &quot;spoken&quot;, &quot;eaten&quot;); and
#present participle, which is formed with an &quot;-ing&quot; suffix (e.g. &quot;breaking&quot;, &quot;making&quot;, &quot;understanding&quot;).
Some grammars further distinguish &quot;passive participles&quot; as often associated with passive voice versus &quot;active participles&quot; as often associated with e.g. the present progressive tense, but such linguistic distinctions are neither recognized nor employed on a universal basis.

== Types ==

Participles can be used adjectivally (i.e. without characteristics of canonical verbs) as &quot;attributive adjectives&quot;. Unlike standard verbs, participles don’t typically have objects or the usual modifiers that verbs have. However, they can be modified by adverbs such as &quot;very&quot; or &quot;slightly&quot;. The difference is illustrated by the following examples:
*The subject interesting him is Greek history.
*Greek history is an interesting subject.
*Greek history is a very interesting subject.

In the first sentence, &quot;interesting&quot; functions transitively in a non-finite sense as a participle that expresses the object &quot;him&quot;, thereby forming the grammatical equivalent of &quot;[that is] &quot;interesting him&quot;&quot;. In the second and third sentences, &quot;interesting&quot; functions as a prepositive adjective modifying &quot;subject&quot;. An adverb (such as &quot;very&quot; or &quot;recently&quot;) or a prefix (such as &quot;un-&quot;) can preface adjectival participles: &quot;a &quot;very frightened&quot; rabbit&quot;, &quot;&quot;recently fallen&quot; leaves&quot;, &quot;&quot;uninterested&quot; people&quot;.

Some languages differentiate adjectival participles and adverbial participles. An adverbial participle (or a participial phrase/clause based on such a participle) plays the role of an adverbial phrase in the sentence in which it appears, whereas an adjectival participle (or a participial phrase/clause based on one) plays the role of an adjective phrase. Such languages include Russian and other Slavic languages, Hungarian, and many Eskimo languages, such as Sirenik, which has a sophisticated participle system. Details can be found in the sections below or in the articles on the grammars of specific languages.

Grammatical descriptions vary in the way these are treated. Some descriptive grammars treat such adverbial and adjectival participles as distinct lexical categories, while others include them both in a single category of participles. Adverbial participles in certain languages may be called converbs, gerunds, or gerundives (though this is not consistent with the meanings of the terms &quot;gerund&quot; or &quot;gerundive&quot; as normally applied to English or Latin), or transgressives.

===Tense===
Participles are often used to form certain grammatical tenses or grammatical aspects. The two types of participle in Modern English are termed present participle and past participle, respectively (often also referred to as the &quot;-ing form&quot; and &quot;-ed/-en form&quot;). The traditional terms are misleading because the participles do not necessarily correspond to tense: the present participle is often associated with the progressive (continuous) aspect, while the past participle is linked with the perfect aspect or passive voice. See the examples below:

*They were just standing there.
*By the time you get home, I will have cleaned the house.

The first sentence is in the past tense (&quot;were&quot;), but a present participle expresses the progressive aspect (&quot;be standing&quot;). The second sentence is in the future tense (&quot;will&quot;), but a past participle is used for the perfect aspect (&quot;have cleaned&quot;).

===Voice===
Participles may also be identified with a particular voice: active or passive. Some languages (such as Latin and Russian) have distinct participles for active and passive uses. In English, the present participle is essentially an active participle, and the past participle has both active and passive uses.

The following examples illustrate those concepts:
* I saw John eating his dinner. (Here &quot;eating&quot; is an active present participle).
* The bus has gone. (Here &quot;gone&quot; is an active past participle).
* The window was broken with a rock. (Here &quot;broken&quot; is a passive past participle)

==Indo-European languages==

===Germanic languages===

====Early English====
In Old English, past participles of Germanic strong verbs were marked with a &quot;ge-&quot; prefix, as are most strong and weak past participles in Dutch and German today, and often by a vowel change in the stem. Those of weak verbs were marked by the ending &quot;-d&quot;, with or without an epenthetic vowel before it. Modern English past participles derive from these forms (although the &quot;ge-&quot; prefix, which became &quot;y-&quot; in Middle English, has now been lost — except in some rare dialects such as the Dorset dialect, where it takes the form of &quot;a-&quot;).

Old English present participles were marked with an ending in &quot;-ende&quot; (or &quot;-iende&quot; for verbs whose infinitives ended in &quot;-ian&quot;).

====Middle English====
In Middle English, the form of the present participle varied across regions: &quot;-ende&quot; (southwest, southeast, Midlands), &quot;-inde&quot; (southwest, southeast), &quot;-and&quot; (north), &quot;-inge&quot; (southeast). The last is the one that became standard, falling together with the suffix &quot;-ing&quot; used to form verbal nouns. See &quot;-ing&quot; (etymology).

====Modern English====
Modern English includes two traditional terms for its participles:
* The &quot;present participle&quot;, also sometimes called the &quot;active&quot;, &quot;imperfect&quot;, or &quot;progressive&quot; participle, takes the ending &quot;-ing&quot;, for example &quot;doing&quot;, &quot;seeing&quot;, &quot;working&quot;, &quot;running&quot;, &quot;breaking&quot;, &quot;understanding&quot;. It is identical in form to the verbal noun and gerund (see below). The term &quot;present participle&quot; is sometimes used to include the gerund; the term &quot;gerund–participle&quot; is also used to indicate the verb form.
* The &quot;past participle&quot;, also sometimes called the &quot;passive&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; participle, is identical to the past tense form (ending in &quot;-ed&quot;) in the case of regular verbs, for example &quot;loaded&quot;, &quot;boiled&quot;, &quot;mounted&quot;, but takes various forms in the case of irregular verbs, such as &quot;done&quot;, &quot;sung&quot;, &quot;written&quot;, &quot;broken&quot;, &quot;understood&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;gone&quot;, etc.

In addition, various compound participles can be formed, such as &quot;having done&quot;, &quot;being done&quot;, &quot;having been doing&quot;, &quot;having been done&quot;.

Details of participle formation can be found under English verbs and List of English irregular verbs.

Participles, or participial phrases (clauses) formed from them, are used as follows:

1. As an adjective used in an attributive sense:
* A broken window (i.e., one that has been broken)
* An interesting book (i.e., one that interests)
* An exciting adventure (i.e., one that excites)
* The attached files (i.e., those that are attached)
* A fallen tree (i.e., one that has fallen)
* Our fallen comrades (i.e., those who have fallen)

Additionally, participles that express an adjectivally attributive meaning can be affixed to form adverbs, such as &quot;interestingly&quot; and &quot;excitedly&quot;.

2. In postpositive phrases. These are often regarded as functioning as a reduced relative clause:
* A window broken by the wind (A window that was broken by the wind).
* A woman wearing a red hat (A woman who was wearing a red hat).
* The man standing over there is my uncle (The man who is standing over there is my uncle).
* We are a people clamoring for freedom (We are a people who are clamoring for freedom).

3. In an adverbial phrase. In the following, the subject is understood to be the same as that of the main clause:
* Reviewing her bank statement, Ann started to cry (While she reviewed her bank statement, Ann started to cry).
* Having reviewed the bank statement, Ann started to cry (After she reviewed her bank statement, Ann started to cry).
* He shot the man, killing him (He shot the man and killed him).
* Maintained properly, wooden buildings can last for centuries (If/when they are maintained properly, wooden buildings can last for centuries).

With a different subject, placed before the participle:
* He and I having reconciled our differences, the project then proceeded smoothly (Because/after he and I had reconciled our differences, the project proceeded smoothly). (This is known as the nominative absolute construction.)

More generally as a clause or sentence modifier: 
* Broadly speaking, the project was successful.

4. Participles are used to form periphrastic verb tenses:

The present participle forms the progressive aspect with the auxiliary verb &quot;be&quot;:

* Jim was sleeping.

The past participle forms the perfect aspect with the auxiliary verb &quot;have&quot;:

* The chicken has eaten.

5. The past participle is used to form passive voice: 
* The chicken was eaten.
Such passive participles can appear in an adjectival phrase: 
*The chicken eaten by the children was contaminated. 
Adverbially: 
*Eaten in this manner, the chicken presents no problem.
And in a nominative absolute construction, with a subject: 
*The chicken eaten, we returned home.

Note that a past participle that complements a stative verb (e.g., &quot;The files that &quot;are attached&quot; or &quot;Our comrades who &quot;have fallen&quot;&quot;) becomes a passive participle within a passive voice construct.

6. As a gerund. The gerund is traditionally regarded as distinct from the present participle. A gerund can function transitively (e.g., &quot;I like &quot;eating ice cream&quot;&quot;) or intransitively (e.g., &quot;I like &quot;swimming&quot;&quot;). In both instances, a gerund functions nominatively rather than adjectivally or adverbially—whether as an object (e.g., &quot;I like &quot;sleeping&quot;) or as a subject (e.g., &quot;Sleeping&quot; is not allowed&quot;). Although &quot;gerunds&quot; and &quot;present participles&quot; are morphologically identical, their grammatical functions differ substantially.

Sometimes their morphological similarity can create contextual ambiguity, as Noam Chomsky pointed out in his well-known example:
*Flying planes can be dangerous.

When the meaning is &quot;The practice of flying a plane is dangerous,&quot; &quot;flying&quot; functions as a gerund; when the danger concerns &quot;Planes that fly&quot; or &quot;Planes when they are flying&quot; (i.e., in contrast to &quot;grounded planes&quot;), &quot;flying&quot; is being used adjectivally as a participle. For more on the distinctions between these uses of the &quot;-ing&quot; verb form, see &quot;-ing&quot;: uses.

For more details on uses of participles and other parts of verbs in English, see Uses of English verb forms, including the sections on the present participle and past participle.

The following table summarises some of the uses of participles in English:

==== Scandinavian languages ====
In all of the Scandinavian languages the past participle has to agree with the noun to some degree. All of the Scandinavian languages have mandatory agreement with the noun in number. Nynorsk and Swedish have mandatory agreement in both number and gender. Icelandic and Faroese have agreement in number, gender and case. The verb form used for the perfect (or &quot;supine&quot;) aspect is generally identical to the nominative neuter singular form of the past participle for all verbs. For the present participle there is no agreement.

Examples in Nynorsk:
* Sjølvkøyrande bilar kan vere farlege. (English: self-driving &quot;cars can be dangerous)&quot;
* Kyllingen vart eten (English: The chicken was eaten)
* Dyret vart ete (English: The deer was eaten)
The participles are marked in bold. The first example involves a present participle and the two latter examples involves a past participle. All present participles end with an -ande suffix.

In Norwegian, the present participle may be used to form adjectives or adverbs denoting the possibility or convenience of performing the action prescribed by the verb. For example:
* Var maten etande? (English: Was the food edible?) (or rather: Was the food any good?)
* Utan servo vert bilen fort ukøyrande. (English: Without power steering, the car soon becomes impossible to drive.) (Lit: un-drivable)
This construction is allowed in Nynorsk, but not in Bokmål, where suffixes like &quot;-elig&quot; or &quot;-bar&quot; are used instead.

===Latin and Romance languages===

====Latin====
Latin grammar was studied in Europe for hundreds of years, especially the handbook written by the 4th-century teacher Aelius Donatus, and it is from Latin that the name and concept of the participle derives. According to Donatus there are four participles in Latin, as follows:

* present participle: present stem + &quot;-ns&quot; (gen. &quot;-ntis&quot;); e.g. &quot;legēns&quot; (plural &quot;legentēs&quot;) &quot;(while) reading&quot;
* perfect participle: supine stem + &quot;-us&quot;, &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-um&quot;; e.g. &quot;lēctus&quot; &quot;read (by someone)&quot;
* future participle: supine stem + &quot;-ūrus&quot;, &quot;-ūra&quot;, &quot;-ūrum&quot;; e.g. &quot;lēctūrus&quot; &quot;going to read&quot;, &quot;due to read&quot;
* gerundive (sometimes considered the future passive participle): e.g. &quot;legendus&quot; &quot;due to be read&quot;, &quot;necessary to be read&quot;

However, many modern Latin grammars treat the gerundive as a separate part of speech.

The perfect participle is usually passive in meaning, and thus mainly formed from transitive verbs, for example &quot;frāctus&quot; &quot;broken&quot;, &quot;missus&quot; &quot;sent (by someone)&quot;. However, certain verbs (called deponent verbs) have a perfect participle in an active sense, e.g. &quot;profectus&quot; &quot;having set out&quot;, &quot;hortātus&quot; &quot;having encouraged&quot;, etc. The present and future participles are always active, the gerundive usually passive.

Because a participle is an adjective as well as a verb, just like any other Latin adjective its ending changes according to the noun it describes. So when the noun is masculine, the participle must be masculine; when the noun is in the accusative (object) case, the participle is also in the accusative case; when the noun has plural endings, the participle also has plural endings. Thus a simple participle such as &quot;frāctus&quot; &quot;broken&quot; can change to &quot;frācta&quot;, &quot;frāctum&quot;, &quot;frāctī&quot;, &quot;frāctō&quot; and so on, according to its gender, number, and case.

A participle can have a descriptive meaning like an adjective, or a more dynamic meaning like a verb. Thus in the following sentence the participle &quot;strīctō&quot; &quot;drawn&quot; is better taken as describing an action (&quot;he drew his sword&quot; or &quot;after drawing his sword&quot;) rather than as describing the sword (&quot;with a drawn sword&quot;):

*&quot;Strīctō gladiō ad dormientem Lucrētiam vēnit.&quot;&quot;With drawn sword he came to the sleeping Lucretia.&quot;

The dynamic, verbal meaning is more common, and Latin often uses a participle where English might use a simple verb.

The present participle often describes the circumstances attending the main verb. A typical example is:
*&quot;Balbus ad mē vēnit currēns&quot;.&quot;Balbus came to me running.&quot;

Both the future and the perfect participle (but not the present participle) can be used with various tenses of the verb &quot;esse&quot; &quot;to be&quot; to make a compound tense such as the future-in-the-past or the perfect passive:
*&quot;Eō diē Rōmam ventūrus erat.&quot;&quot;On that day he was going to return to Rome.&quot;
*&quot;Occīsus est ā Thēbānīs.&quot;&quot;He was killed by the Thebans.&quot;

The perfect and future participles can also be used, with or without the verb &quot;esse&quot; &quot;to be&quot;, in indirect speech clauses:
*&quot;(Dīxit eōs) locum facile inventūrōs (esse).&quot;&quot;He said that they were easily going to find the place / He said that they would find the place easily.&quot;

For uses of the gerundive, see Latin syntax#The gerundive.

====French====
There are two basic participles:
*Present active participle: formed by dropping the &quot;-ons&quot; of the &quot;nous&quot; form of the present tense of a verb (except with &quot;être&quot; and &quot;avoir&quot;) and then adding &quot;ant&quot;: &quot;marchant&quot; &quot;walking&quot;, &quot;étant&quot; &quot;being&quot;, &quot;ayant&quot; &quot;having&quot;.
*Past participle: formation varies according to verb group: &quot;vendu&quot; &quot;sold&quot;, &quot;mis&quot; &quot;placed&quot;, &quot;marché&quot; &quot;walked&quot;, &quot;été&quot; &quot;been&quot;, and &quot;fait&quot; &quot;done&quot;. The sense of the past participle is passive as an adjective and in most verbal constructions with &quot;être&quot;, but active in verbal constructions with &quot;avoir&quot;, in reflexive constructions, and with some intransitive verbs.

Compound participles are possible:
*Present perfect participle: &quot;ayant appelé&quot; &quot;having called&quot;, &quot;étant mort&quot; &quot;being dead&quot;
*Passive perfect participle: &quot;étant vendu&quot; &quot;being sold, having been sold&quot;

Usage:
*Present participles are used as qualifiers as in &quot;un insecte volant&quot; (a flying insect) and in some other contexts. They are never used to form tenses.
*Past participles are used as qualifiers for nouns: &quot;la table cassée&quot; (the broken table); to form compound tenses such as the perfect &quot;Vous avez dit&quot; (you have said) and to form the passive voice: &quot;il a été tué&quot; (he/it has been killed).

====Spanish====
In Spanish, the so-called present or active participle (&quot;participio activo&quot; or &quot;participio de presente&quot;) of a verb is traditionally formed with one of the suffixes &quot;-ante, -ente&quot; or &quot;-iente&quot;, but modern grammar does not consider it a true participle, as such forms usually have the meaning of simple adjectives or nouns: e.g. &quot;amante&quot; &quot;loving&quot; or &quot;lover&quot;, &quot;viviente&quot; &quot;living&quot; or &quot;live&quot;.

The past participle (&quot;participio pasado&quot; or &quot;participio pasivo&quot;) is regularly formed with one of the suffixes &quot;-ado&quot; or &quot;-ido (-ado&quot; for verbs ending in &quot;-ar&quot; and &quot;-ido&quot; for verbs ending in &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-ir&quot;; but some verbs have an irregular form ending in &quot;-to&quot; (e.g. &quot;escrito, visto, puesto&quot;), or &quot;-cho&quot; (e.g. &quot;dicho, hecho&quot;). The past participle is used generally as an adjective referring to a finished action, in which case its ending changes according to gender and number. At other times is used to form compound tenses: the present perfect, past perfect (sometimes referred to as the &quot;pluscuamperfecto&quot;), and the future perfect, in which case it is indeclinable. Some examples:

As an adjective (note how &quot;escritas&quot; agrees in gender with the noun, &quot;las cartas&quot;):
*&quot;las cartas escritas&quot; &quot;the written letters&quot;

To form compound tenses:
*&quot;Ha escrito una carta.&quot; &quot;She (he, it) has written a letter.&quot;
*&quot;Había escrito una carta.&quot; &quot;She (he, it) had written a letter.&quot;
*&quot;Habrá escrito una carta.&quot; &quot;She (he, it) will have written a letter.&quot;

===Hellenic languages===

====Ancient Greek====

The Ancient Greek participle shares in the properties of adjectives and verbs. Like an adjective, it changes form for gender, case, and number. Like a verb, it has tense and voice, is modified by adverbs, and can take verb arguments, including an object. Participles are quite numerous in Ancient Greek: a non-defective verb has as many as ten participles.

There is a form of the participle for every combination of aspect (present, aorist, perfect, future) and voice (active, middle, passive). All participles are based on their finite forms. Here are the masculine nominative singular forms for a thematic and an athematic verb:


Like an adjective, it can modify a noun, and can be used to embed one thought into another.

In the example, the participial phrase &quot;tòn eû stratēgḗsonta&quot;, literally &quot;the one going to be a good general,&quot; is used to embed the idea &quot;eû stratēgḗsei&quot; &quot;he will be a good general&quot; within the main verb.

The participle is very widely used in Ancient Greek, especially in prose.

=== Indo-Aryan languages ===

==== Hindi and Urdu ====
There are two types of participles in Hindi and Urdu (called together Hindustani), aspectual participles which mark the aspect and non-aspectual participles which do not mark verbal aspect. The table below mentions the different participles present in Hindustani, &quot;ɸ&quot; denotes the verb root. The aspectual participles can take a few other copulas after them besides the verb honā &quot;to be&quot;. Those copular verbs are rêhna &quot;&quot;to stay&quot;, ānā &quot;to come&quot;, jānā &quot;to go&quot;.&quot;
==== Sanskrit ====

Much like Ancient Greek, Sanskrit has a wide array of participles.

===Celtic languages===

====Cornish====
In Cornish, an equivalent present participle construction to English is formed by using &quot;ow&quot; (&quot;owth&quot; before vowels) with a verbal noun, e.g. &quot;Yma an den ow hwerthin&quot; (&quot;The man is laughing&quot;), and &quot;den ow hwerthin&quot; (&quot;a laughing man&quot;). Like Breton but unlike Welsh, Cornish also has verbal adjectives which are used similarly to English past participles, e.g. &quot;dehen molys&quot; (&quot;clotted cream&quot;), from the verbal noun &quot;mola&quot; &quot;to clot&quot;.

====Welsh====
In Welsh, the effect of a participle in the active voice is constructed by &quot;yn&quot; followed by the verb-noun (for the present participle) and &quot;wedi&quot; followed by the verb-noun (for the past participle). There is no mutation in either case. In the passive voice, participles are usually replaced by a compound phrase such as &quot;wedi cael ei/eu&quot; (&quot;having got his/her/their ...ing&quot;) in modern Welsh and by the impersonal form in literary Welsh.

===Slavic languages===

====Polish====
The Polish word for participle is &quot;imiesłów&quot; (pl.: &quot;imiesłowy&quot;). There are four types of &quot;imiesłowy&quot; in two classes:

Adjectival participle (&quot;imiesłów przymiotnikowy&quot;):
* active adjectival participle (&quot;imiesłów przymiotnikowy czynny&quot;): &quot;robiący&quot; – &quot;doing&quot;, &quot;one who does&quot;
* passive adjectival participle (&quot;imiesłów przymiotnikowy bierny&quot;): &quot;robiony&quot; – &quot;being done&quot; (can only be formed off transitive verbs)

Adverbial participle (&quot;imiesłów przysłówkowy&quot;):
* present adverbial participle (&quot;imiesłów przysłówkowy współczesny&quot;): robiąc – &quot;doing&quot;, &quot;while doing&quot;
* perfect adverbial participle (&quot;imiesłów przysłówkowy uprzedni&quot;): &quot;zrobiwszy&quot; – &quot;having done&quot; (formed in virtually all cases off verbs in their perfective forms, here denoted by the prefix &quot;z-&quot;)

Due to the distinction between adjectival and adverbial participles, in Polish it is practically impossible to make a dangling participle in the classical English meaning of the term. For instance, in the sentence:

*I found them hiding in the closet.

it is unclear whether &quot;I&quot; or &quot;they&quot; were hiding in the closet. In Polish there is a clear distinction:

* &quot;Znalazłem ich, chowając się w szafie.&quot; – &quot;chowając&quot; is a present adverbial participle agreeing grammatically with the subject (&quot;I&quot;)
* &quot;Znalazłem ich chowających się w szafie.&quot; – &quot;chowających&quot; is an active adjectival participle agreeing grammatically with the object (&quot;them&quot;)

====Russian====
Verb: слышать [ˈsɫɨ.ʂɐtʲ] (to hear, imperfective aspect)

*Present active: слышащий [ˈsɫɨ.ʂɐ.ɕːɪj] &quot;hearing&quot;, &quot;who hears&quot; 
*Present passive: слышимый [ˈsɫɨ.ʂɨ̞.mɨ̞j] &quot;being heard&quot;, &quot;that is heard&quot;, &quot;audible&quot; 
*Past active: слышавший [ˈsɫɨ.ʂɐf.ʂɨ̞j] &quot;who heard&quot;, &quot;who was hearing&quot; 
*Past passive: слышанный [ˈsɫɨ.ʂɐn.nɨ̞j] &quot;that was heard&quot;, &quot;that was being heard&quot; 
*Adverbial present active: слыша [ˈsɫɨ.ʂɐ] &quot;(while) hearing&quot; 
*Adverbial past active: слышав [ˈsɫɨ.ʂɐf] &quot;(while) hearing&quot; (used mostly in the negative in the modern language, e.g. не слышав &quot;without ever hearing&quot;)

Verb: услышать [ʊˈsɫɨ.ʂɐtʲ] (to hear, perfective aspect)

*Past active: услышавший [ʊˈsɫɨ.ʂɐf.ʂɨ̞j] &quot;who has heard&quot;
*Past passive: услышанный [ʊˈsɫɨ.ʂɐn.nɨ̞j] &quot;that has been heard&quot;, &quot;who has been heard&quot;
*Adverbial past active: услышав [ʊˈsɫɨ.ʂɐf] &quot;having heard&quot;, &quot;after hearing&quot;

Future participles formed from perfective verbs are not considered a part of standard language.

====Bulgarian====
Participles are adjectives formed from verbs. There are various kinds:

Verb: правя [pravja] (to do, imperfective aspect):
*Present active: правещ [pravešt]
*Past active aorist: правил [pravil]
*Past active imperfect: правел [pravel] (only used in verbal constructions)
*Past passive: правен [praven]
*Adverbial present active: правейки [pravejki]

Verb: направя [napravja] (to do, perfective aspect):
*Past active aorist: направил [napravil]
*Past active imperfect: направел [napravel] (only used in verbal constructions)
*Past passive: направен [napraven]

====Macedonian====
Macedonian has completely lost or transformed the participles of Common Slavic, unlike the other Slavic languages. The following points may be noted:
* present active participle: this has transformed into a verbal adverb;
* present passive participle: there are some isolated cases or remnants of the present passive participle, such as the word лаком [lakom] (greedy);
* past active participle: there is only one remnant of the past active participle, which is the word бивш [bivš] (former). However, this word is often replaced with the word поранешен [poranešen] (former);
* past passive participle: this has been transformed into a verbal adjective (it behaves like a normal adjective);
* resultative participle: this has transformed into a verbal l-form (глаголска л-форма). It is not a participle since it does not function attributively.

===Baltic languages===

====Lithuanian====
Among Indo-European languages, the Lithuanian language is unique for having fourteen different participial forms of the verb, which can be grouped into five when accounting for inflection by tense. Some of these are also inflected by gender and case. For example, the verb &quot;eiti&quot; (&quot;to go, to walk&quot;) has the active participle forms &quot;einąs/einantis&quot; (&quot;going, walking&quot;, present tense), &quot;ėjęs&quot; (past tense), &quot;eisiąs&quot; (future tense), &quot;eidavęs&quot; (past frequentative tense), the passive participle forms &quot;einamas&quot; (&quot;being walked&quot;, present tense), &quot;eitas&quot; (&quot;walked&quot; past tense), &quot;eisimas&quot; (future tense), the adverbial participles &quot;einant&quot; (&quot;while [he, different subject] is walking&quot; present tense), &quot;ėjus&quot; (past tense), &quot;eisiant&quot; (future tense), &quot;eidavus&quot; (past frequentative tense), the semi-participle &quot;eidamas&quot; (&quot;while [he, the same subject] is going, walking&quot;) and the participle of necessity &quot;eitinas&quot; (&quot;what needs to be walked&quot;). The active and passive participles and the semi-participles are inflected by gender, and the active, passive and necessity participles are inflected by case.

==Semitic languages==

===Arabic===

The Arabic verb has two participles: an active participle (&quot;ʾism al-fāʿil&quot; اسم الفاعل) and a passive participle (&quot;ʾism al-mafʿūl&quot; اسم المفعول), and the form of the participle is predictable by inspection of the dictionary form of the verb. These participles are inflected for gender, number and case, but not person. Arabic participles are employed syntactically in a variety of ways: as nouns, as adjectives or even as verbs. Their uses vary across varieties of Arabic. In general the active participle describes a property of the syntactic subject of the verb from which it derives, whilst the passive participles describes the object. For example, from the verb كتب &quot;kataba&quot;, the active participle is &quot;kātib&quot; كاتب and the passive participle is &quot;maktūb&quot; مكتوب. Roughly these translate to &quot;writing&quot; and &quot;written&quot; respectively. However, they have different, derived lexical uses. كاتب &quot;kātib&quot; is further lexicalized as &quot;writer&quot;, &quot;author&quot; and مكتوب &quot;maktūb&quot; as &quot;letter&quot;.

In Classical Arabic, the participles do not participate in verbal constructions with auxiliaries the same way as their English counterparts and rarely take on a verbal meaning in a sentence (a notable exception being participles derived from motion verbs as well as participles in Qur&#x27;anic Arabic). In certain dialects of Arabic, however, it is much more common for the participles, especially the active participle, to have verbal force in the sentence. For example, in dialects of the Levant, the active participle is a structure that describes the state of the syntactic subject after the action of the verb from which it derives has taken place. &quot;ʼĀkil&quot;, the active participle of &quot;ʼakala&quot; (&quot;to eat&quot;), describes one&#x27;s state after having eaten something. Therefore, it can be used in analogous way to the English present perfect (for example, &quot;ʼAnā ʼākil&quot; انا آكل meaning &quot;I have eaten&quot;, &quot;I have just eaten&quot; or &quot;I have already eaten&quot;). Other verbs, such as &quot;rāḥa&quot; راح (&quot;to go&quot;) give a participle (&quot;rāyiḥ&quot; رايح), which has a progressive (&quot;is going…&quot;) meaning. The exact tense or continuity of the participles is, therefore, determined by the nature of the specific verb (especially its lexical aspect and its transitivity) and the syntactic/semantic context of the utterance. What ties them all together is that they describe the subject of the verb from which they derive. The passive participles in certain dialects can be used as a sort of passive voice, but more often than not, they are used in their various lexicalized senses as adjectives or nouns.

===Hebrew===
Like Arabic, Hebrew has two types of participles (בינוני &quot;bênônî&quot;): an active participle (בינוני פועל &quot;bênônî pô&#x27;ēl&quot;) and a passive participle (בינוני פעול &quot;bênônî pā&#x27;ûl&quot;). These participles are inflected for gender and number. The active participle takes a variety of syntactic roles, such as a verb in present tense, a noun, and an adjective.

Hebrew has a syntactic construction of the verb &quot;to be&quot; (הָיָה) &quot;hayá&quot; in the past tense, and the active participle that cognates to the past progressive tense in English. For example, the word עבדתי &quot;avádti&quot; means &quot;I worked&quot;, and הייתי עובד &quot;hayíti ovéd&quot; means &quot;I was working&quot;. Another use of this syntactic structure is equivalent to &quot;used to&quot; in English. For example, דויד בילדותו היה גר בארצות הברית &quot;davíd b&#x27;yaldutó hayá gar b&#x27;arcót habrít&quot; (David in his childhood used to live in the United States).

==Finno-Ugric languages==

===Finnish===
Finnish uses six participles (&quot;partisiippi&quot;) to convey different meanings. Below is a table displaying the declension of the participles of the verb tappaa (to kill).


The participles work in the following way:

Each of the participles can be used as adjectives and so some of them can be turned into nouns.

===Hungarian===
Hungarian uses adjectival and adverbial participles.

Adjectival participles (&quot;melléknévi igenév&quot;) can be one of these three types:
* Present (active): &quot;olvas&quot; (read) – &quot;olvasó&quot; (reading), &quot;él&quot; (live) – &quot;élő&quot; (living)
* Past (usually passive): &quot;zár&quot; (close) – &quot;zárt&quot; (closed)
* Future (has a modal meaning): &quot;olvas&quot; (read) – &quot;olvasandó&quot; (to be read), &quot;fizet&quot; (pay) – &quot;fizetendő&quot; (to be paid)

Adverbial participles (&quot;határozói igenév&quot;) can be:
* Imperfect: &quot;siet&quot; (hurry) – &quot;sietve&quot; (hurrying, i.e. in a hurrying manner)
* Perfect: &quot;bemegy&quot; (go in) – &quot;bemenvén&quot; (having gone in) (this form is rarely used in modern Hungarian)

In Hungarian grammar, the infinitive is also considered a kind of participle, the noun participle (&quot;főnévi igenév&quot;).

==Turkic languages==

===Turkish===
Participles are called &quot;sıfat-fiil&quot; (lit. adjective-verb) or &quot;ortaç&quot; in Turkish.

Turkish participles consist of a verb stem and a suffix. Some participles may be conjugated, but some may not. Participles always precede the noun they are defining, unlike in English.

Participle suffixes, like many other suffixes in Turkish, change according to the vowel harmony and sandhi.

There are eight types of participle suffixes; &quot;-en&quot;, &quot;-esi&quot;, &quot;-mez&quot;, &quot;-ar&quot;, &quot;-di(k/ği)&quot; &quot;-ecek&quot; and &quot;-miş&quot; 

An easy way to remember those is a mnemonic taught in Turkish schools: &quot;Anası mezar dikecekmiş&quot;, which has every type of the suffixes, and is still a coherent sentence, translated as &quot;his/her mother is allegedly going to plant a grave(stone)&quot;.

==Eskimo–Aleut languages==

===Sirenik===
Sirenik language, an extinct Eskimo–Aleut language, had separate sets of &quot;adverbial participles&quot; and &quot;adjectival participles&quot;. Unlike in English, adverbial participles were conjugated to reflect the person and number of their implicit subjects; hence, an adverbial participle could replace a clause in the English sentence &quot;If &quot;I&quot; were a marksman, &quot;I&quot; would kill walruses&quot; since the subject was implied by the conjugation.

==Constructed languages==

===Esperanto===
Esperanto has six different participle conjugations; active and passive for past, present and future. The participles are formed as follows:

For example, a &quot;falonta botelo&quot; is a bottle that will fall or is about to fall. A &quot;falanta botelo&quot; is one that is falling through the air. After it hits the floor, it is a &quot;falinta botelo.&quot; These examples use the active participles, but the usage of the passive participles is similar. A cake that is going to be divided is a &quot;dividota kuko&quot;. When it is in the process of being divided, it is a &quot;dividata kuko&quot;. Having been cut, it is now a &quot;dividita kuko&quot;.

These participles can be used in conjunction with the verb to be, &quot;esti&quot;, forming 18 compound tenses (9 active and 9 passive). However, this soon becomes complicated and often unnecessary, and is only frequently used when rigorous translation of English is required. An example of this would be &quot;la knabo estos instruita&quot;, or, the boy will have been taught. This example sentence is then in the future anterior.

When the suffix &quot;-o&quot; is used, instead of &quot;-a&quot;, then the participle refers to a person. A &quot;manĝanto&quot; is someone who is eating. A &quot;manĝinto&quot; is someone who ate. A &quot;manĝonto&quot; is someone who will eat. Also, a &quot;manĝito&quot; is someone who was eaten, a &quot;manĝato&quot; is someone who is being eaten, and a &quot;manĝoto&quot; is someone who will be eaten.

These rules hold true for all transitive verbs. Since copular and intransitive verbs do not have passive voice, their participle forms can only be active.

An informal and unofficial addition to these six are the participles for conditional forms, which use &quot;-unt-&quot; and &quot;-ut-&quot;. For example, &quot;parolunto&quot; refers to someone who would speak (or would have spoken), and a &quot;leguta libro&quot; is a book that would be read (or have been read). These unofficial participle forms are however very rarely used in practice.

<text>The Baghdad Nuclear Research Facility adjacent to the Tuwaitha &quot;Yellow Cake Factory&quot; or Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center contains the remains of nuclear reactors bombed by Iran in 1980, Israel in 1981, and the United States in 1991. It was used as a storage facility for spent reactor fuel and industrial and medical wastes. The radioactive material would not be useful for a fission bomb, but could be used in a dirty bomb. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the facility was heavily looted by hundreds of Iraqis, though it is unclear what was taken.

==History==
The Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center was the main nuclear site in Iraq that was involved with handling nuclear material. It was started in 1967 when three main nuclear facilities and waste location were put in operation. These were the IRT 2000 research reactor, the radioisotope production building and the dumping station (waste store). Many other nuclear facilities were subsequently constructed at this site, and the IRT 2000 reactor was also upgraded to IRT 5000.

Until 1991, the facility was a nuclear research facility supposedly under the direction of Khidir Hamza. The facility is surrounded by a sand berm four miles (6.4 km) around and 160 feet (50 m) high, and contained the French-built research reactor Osirak, destroyed by Israel in 1981. Israel contended that there was a secret underground compartment for the production of plutonium. Plutonium is produced in breeder reactors by surrounding a neutron source, such as a nuclear reactor, with a &#x27;blanket&#x27; of U-238. The neutrons released by nuclear fission are donated, producing Pu-239 and is the cheapest and easiest way to achieve large-scale production of plutonium. The director of the IAEA, which conducted regular inspections of the complex, argued that a secret vault 40 meters below the reactor core would not be very effective, to which Israel responded by correcting their original statement to 4 meters. The IAEA was aware of such a vault but the reactor floor was shielded and the vault contained the mechanisms for raising the control rods which requires access for maintenance. According to the Director of the IAEA, the shielding would block the neutrons needed to turn U-238 into Pu-239 and the reactor would not be able to operate if the vault was blocked by being filled with uranium.

As the sole reactor site in Iraq, the reactors relied on fuel imported from France and was unable to produce significant quantities of enriched uranium. In 1991, If Iraq had converted their entire stockpile of nuclear fuel rods, assuming they were able to perform the extremely difficult task of separation from highly irradiated fuel which contained 69 elements, they would only have 41 kg of U-235, less than the 64 kg used in Little Boy. 52 kg of 93% HEU is the minimum critical mass required to create a uranium bomb. They did not have the technical capabilities or resources to produce an implosion type device that uses less U-235 but requires complex lenses and initiators.

During the initial months of the occupation, Tuwaitha was protected by American forces and administered by contractors from the Raytheon Corporation. Complete control of the facility was turned over to Iraqi authorities in the Summer of 2004. During American occupation the complex was looted, mostly for scrap lead. Lead-lined barrels and containers were emptied on-site then taken to a nearby improvised lead foundry then smelted into ingots. The operation was conducted in two parts. The first was a highly orchestrated event requiring industrial machinery in which large pieces of shielding from the destroyed reactors was stolen. The second involved local villagers carrying items on hand-carts. At most 10 kg of uranium was lost in what could easily be explained as minor contamination by a few grams of dust per vessel of the more than 200 containers stolen.

==Research Achievements==
Research conducted at the complex produced novel results necessary to establish a self-sufficient nuclear program.

*The IRT-5000 was used as an extremely limited breeder reactor using 3 Iraqi manufactured natural uranium rods and a 10% enriched rod and reprocessed with the permission of the IAEA. Using PUREX based technology, Project 22 produced 5 grams of plutonium.
*7.6% enrichment using EMIS (magnetic separation) technology, producing a total of 640g from 1985 to 1991.
*Experimenting with the Japanese Asahi Kasei technique, produced 100 kg of polyvinyl, phenylpyridine-based, anion exchange resin over a 2-year period.

Gas centrifuge, laser isotopic separation and gas diffusion technology were investigated but abandoned due to the Iraqi economy lacking the industrial infrastructure to support such an effort. Although the Iraqi government was able to smuggle some steel and carbon-fiber centrifuge units into the country, they needed at least a thousand to process industrial quantities. Without wide availability of extremely high precision instrumentation and production facilities, the task was impossible under anti-proliferation embargoes. Russia and the U.S.A. only developed the high-precision machining technology required during the space race.

<doc id="222757" wikidata="Q1788046" url="?curid=222757" title="Traditional healers of Southern Africa">
<text>Traditional healers of Southern Africa are practitioners of traditional African medicine in Southern Africa. They fulfil different social and political roles in the community like divination, healing physical, emotional, and spiritual illnesses, directing birth or death rituals, finding lost cattle, protecting warriors, counteracting witchcraft and narrating the history, cosmology, and concepts of their tradition.

There are two main types of traditional healers within the Nguni, Sotho, and Tsonga societies of Southern Africa: the diviner (sangoma) and the herbalist (inyanga). These healers are effectively South African shamans who are highly revered and respected in a society where illness is thought to be caused by witchcraft, pollution (contact with impure objects or occurrences) or through neglect of the ancestors. It is estimated that there are as many as 200,000 traditional healers in South Africa compared to 25,000 doctors trained in bio-medical practice. Traditional healers are consulted by approximately 60% of the South African population, usually in conjunction with modern bio-medical services. For harmony between the living and the dead, vital for a trouble-free life, traditional healers believe that the ancestors must be shown respect through ritual and animal sacrifice. They perform summoning rituals by burning plants like &quot;impepho&quot; (&quot;Helichrysum petiolare&quot;), dancing, chanting, channeling or playing drums.

Traditional healers will often give their patients &quot;muthi&quot;—medications made from plant, animal and minerals—imbued with spiritual significance. These muthi often have powerful symbolism; for example, lion fat might be prepared for children to promote courage. There are medicines for everything from physical and mental illness, social disharmony and spiritual difficulties to potions for protection, love and luck.

Although sangoma is a Zulu term that is colloquially used to describe all types of Southern African traditional healers, there are differences between practices: an inyanga is concerned mainly with medicines made from plants and animals, while a sangoma relies primarily on divination for healing purposes and might also be considered a type of fortune teller. A trainee sangoma (or &quot;ithwasane&quot;) starts their &quot;ukuthwasa&quot; or ubungoma (in Xhosa) journey which is associated with the &quot;calling&quot; to become a sangoma, though this event also involves those with schizophrenia. A similar term, &quot;amafufunyana&quot; refers to claims of demonic possession due to members of the Xhosa people exhibiting aberrant behaviour and psychological concerns. After study, it was discovered that this term is directed toward people with varying types of schizophrenia.

In modern times, colonialism, urbanisation, apartheid and transculturation have blurred the distinction between the two and traditional healers tend to practice both arts. Traditional healers can alternate between these roles by diagnosing common illnesses, selling and dispensing remedies for medical complaints, and divining cause and providing solutions to spiritually or socially centred complaints.

Each culture has their own terminology for their traditional healers. Xhosa traditional healers are known as amaxhwele (herbalists) or amagqirha (diviners). Ngaka and selaoli are the terms in Northern Sotho and Southern Sotho respectively, while among the Venda they are called mungome. The Tsonga refer to their healers as &quot;n&#x27;anga&quot; or mungoma.

==Beliefs and tradition==

A sangoma is a practitioner of &quot;Ngoma&quot;, a philosophy based on a belief in ancestral spirits (siSwati: &quot;amadloti&quot;; Zulu: &quot;amadlozi&quot;; Sesotho: &quot;badimo&quot;; Xhosa: &quot;izinyanya&quot;) and the practice of traditional African medicine, which is often a mix of medicinal plants and various animal body fats or skin. Sangomas perform a holistic and symbolic form of healing by drawing on the embedded beliefs of the Bantu peoples in South Africa, who believe that ancestors in the afterlife guide and protect the living. 

Sangomas are called to heal, and through them, it is believed that ancestors from the spirit world can give instruction and advice to heal illness, social disharmony and spiritual difficulties. Traditional healers work in a sacred healing hut or &quot;indumba&quot;, where they believe their ancestors reside. Where no physical &#x27;indumba&#x27; is available, a makeshift miniature sacred place called &quot;imsamo&quot; can be used.

Sangomas believe they are able to access advice and guidance from their ancestors for their patients through spirit possession by an ancestor, or mediumship, divination bones, or by dream interpretation. In possession states, the sangoma works themself into a trance through drumming, dancing and chanting, and allows their ego to step aside for an ancestor to take possession of their body and communicate directly with the patient, or dancing fervently beyond their stated ability. 

The sangoma will provide specific information about the problems of the patient. Some sangomas speak to their patients through regular conversation, whilst others speak in tongues or languages foreign to their patients, but all languages used by sangomas are indigenous Southern African languages depending on the specific ancestors being called upon. Not all sangomas follow the same rituals or beliefs.

Ancestral spirits can be the personal ancestors of the sangoma or the patient, or they might be general ancestors associated with the geographic area or the community. It is believed that the spirits have the power to intervene in people&#x27;s lives who work to connect the sangoma to the spirits that are acting in a manner to cause affliction. For example, a crab could be invoked as a mediator between the human world and the world of spirits because of its ability to move between the world of the land and the sea. Helping and harming spirits are believed to use the human body as a battleground for their own conflicts. By using ngoma, the sangoma believes they can create harmony between the spirits, which is thought to bring an alleviation of the patient&#x27;s suffering.

The sangoma may burn incense (like &quot;impepho&quot;) or sacrifice animals to please the ancestral spirits. Snuff is also used to communicate with the ancestors through prayer.

==Divination, diagnosis and healing practices==
A sangoma&#x27;s goal in healing is to establish a balanced and harmless relationship between the afflicted patient and the spirits that are causing their illness or problem. The healer intercedes between the patient and the world of the dead in order to make restitution. This is generally performed through divination (throwing the bones or ancestral channelling), purification rituals, or animal sacrifice to appease the spirits through the atonement.Throwing bones to access the advice of ancestors is an alternative practice to the relatively exhausting ritual of possession by the ancestor. 
In a typical session, a patient will visit the sangoma, and the sangoma must determine what the affliction is or the reason the patient has come to them for help. Before the throwing of the bones, the healer should first ask for the name and surname of the patient; the healer then calls the ancestors by names, starting with their initiators&#x27; names, then their own, followed by the patient&#x27;s ancestor&#x27;s names. The patient or diviner throws bones on the floor, which may include animal vertebrae, dominoes, dice, coins, shells and stones, each with a specific significance to human life. For example, a hyena bone signifies a thief and will provide information about stolen objects. The sangoma or patient may physically throw the bones, but the ancestors control how they land. The sangoma then interprets this metaphor in relation to the patient&#x27;s afflictions, what the ancestors of the patient require, and how to resolve the disharmony. In the same way, sangomas will interpret metaphors present in dreams, either their own those of their patients. 

When the diviner comes to an acceptable understanding of the problem and the patient agrees, the diviner then throws the bones again to ask the ancestors if they could help the patient. Depending on the feedback from the bones, they will instruct the patient on a course of medicine, which may include the use of ngoma, referral to a herbalist if the sangoma does not have the knowledge themselves, or the recommendation of a Western-style medicine regimen.

==Medicines and muthi==
The spiritually curative medicines prescribed by a traditional healer are called &quot;muthi&quot;. They may be employed in healing as warranted in the opinion of the herbal specialist or &quot;inyanga&quot;. The term &quot;muthi&quot; is derived from the Zulu/Xhosa/Northern Ndebele &quot;umuthi&quot;, meaning &#x27;tree&#x27;.

African traditional medicine makes extensive use of botanical products but the medicine prescribed by an inyanga may also include other formulations which are zoological or mineral in composition. Traditional medicine uses approximately 3,000 out of 30,000 species of higher plants of southern Africa. Over 300 species of plants have been identified as having psychoactive healing effects on the nervous system, many of which need further cultural and scientific study In South African English and Afrikaans, the word muthi is sometimes used as a slang term for medicine in general. A variation on spelling, &quot;muti&quot; is a result of the historical effects of the British colonial spelling.

Bapedi traditional healers use 36 plant species to manage reproductive health problems. These medicinal species are distributed among 35 genera and 20 families. The largest proportion of medicinal species collected belongs to the family Asteraceae (such as Calendula) followed by Fabaceae (such as the butterfly pea plant), and Euphorbiaceae (such as &quot;Phyllanthus Muellerianus&quot;). 
Muthi is prepared, and depending on the affliction, a number of purification practices can be administered. &quot;Abstinence and f&quot;asting are important things to do in preparing muthi and healing. Purification practices include bathing, vomiting, steaming, nasal ingestion, enemas, and cuttings:

# Bathing – Herbal mixtures are added to bath water to purify the patient.
# Vomiting (&quot;phalaza&quot;) – A large volume (up to +-2 litres) of a weak, lukewarm herbal infusion is drunk and a process of self-induced vomiting occurs to cleanse and tone the system.
# Steaming (&quot;futha&quot;) – Medicinal herbs are commonly inhaled by steaming them in a bucket of boiling water. A blanket or preferably a plastic sheet (as blankets absorb heat and don&#x27;t circulate the steam well) is used to cover the patient and container. Hot rocks or a portable stove may be included to keep the bucket boiling. The patient sits under the blanket, breathes in the herbal steam and sweats.
# Nasally – A variety of plants can be taken dried and powdered as snuff. Some are taken to induce sneezing which may traditionally be believed to aid the expulsion of disease. Others are taken for the common conditions such as headaches.
# Enemas – Infusions and some decoctions are commonly administered as enemas. The enema is a preferred route of administration of certain plant extracts, as it is believed they are more effective this way. 
# Cuttings (&quot;ukugcaba&quot;) – Extracts or powders are directly applied to small cuts made with a razor blade in the patient&#x27;s skin.

An experienced inyanga/sangoma will generally seek the guidance of an ancestral spirit before embarking to find and collect muthi. Healers pay attention to dreams and prayers for ancestral advice on auspicious time to collect plants, which particular plants to collect and where these plants are located. Many traditional healers won&#x27;t have to collect plants for each patient as they have herbs stored in their huts. The healer supplements the perceived advice from an ancestral spirit with their own knowledge, training and experience.

== Sangoma calling and training ==
Both men and women can become traditional healers. A sangoma is believed to be &quot;called&quot; to heal through an initiation illness; symptoms involve psychosis, headaches, intractable stomach pain, shoulder, neck complaints, short breath, swollen feet and waist issues or illness that cannot be cured by conventional methods. These problems together must be seen by a sangoma as &quot;thwasa&quot; or the calling of the ancestors, though this event also involves those with schizophrenia. Sangomas believe that failure to respond to the calling will result in further illness until the person concedes and goes to be trained. The word &quot;thwasa&quot; means &#x27;the light of the new moon&#x27; or is derived from &quot;ku mu thwasisa&quot; meaning &#x27;to be led to the light&#x27;.

A trainee sangoma (or &quot;ithwasane&quot;) trains formally under another sangoma for a period of anywhere between a number of months and many years. The training involves learning humility to the ancestors, purification through steaming, washing in the blood of sacrificed animals, and the use of muthi, medicines with spiritual significance. The trainee may not see their families during training and must abstain from sexual contact and often live under harsh and strict conditions. This is part of the cleansing process to prepare the healer for a life&#x27;s work of dedication to healing and the intense experiences of training tend to earn a deeply entrenched place in the sangoma&#x27;s memory.

The training period or ukuthwasa is a deeply personal and spiritual one, marked by various rituals, teachings, and preparations. The process can vary in length, with some sources suggesting a minimum duration of nine months to fully explore and develop the abilities and knowledge of an initiate. The Xhosa term &quot;ukuthwasa&quot; translates to &quot;come out&quot; or &quot;be reborn,&quot; symbolising the transformative nature of the experience. A similar term, &quot;Amafufunyana&quot; refers to claims of demonic possession due to members of the Xhosa people exhibiting aberrant behaviour and psychological concerns. After study, it was discovered that this term is directed toward people with varying types of schizophrenia.

During the training period the healer in training will share their ailments in the form of song and dance, a process that is nurtured by the analysis of dreams, anxieties, and with prayer. The story develops into a song that becomes a large part of the graduation-type ceremony that marks the end of the ukuthwasa training. 

At times in the training, and for the graduation, a ritual sacrifice of an animal is required to be performed (usually chickens and a goat or cow). At the end of the training, to signify the start of initiation, a female goat is slaughtered during the early hours of the morning and the next day chickens will be sacrificed next to a river before a second large animal is slaughtered. All these sacrifices are to call to the ancestors and appease them. 

The local community, friends and family are all invited to the initiation to witness and celebrate the completion of training. The trainee is tested by the local elder sangomas to determine whether they have the skills and insight necessary to heal. The climactic initiation test is to ensure the trainee has the ability to &quot;see&quot; things hidden from view. This is proved when other sangomas hide sacred objects for the trainee to find in front of the community. The trainee must call upon their ancestors, find the hidden objects, which include the skin of the sacrificed goat and the ancestors&#x27; clothes, and return them back to the sangomas that hid them, thus proving they have the ability to &#x27;see&#x27; beyond the physical world. The practise is done at night and involves removing the traditional clothing worn throughout the day to be hidden again for the trainee to find. The graduation ceremony takes three days from Friday to Sunday. During the early hours of the morning the trainee is required to sweep the yard, wash their clothing and bath in the river, only returning home when they are dry.

==Drumming and ancestral dancing==

Sangoma can also literally mean &#x27;person of the drum&#x27; or &#x27;the drumming one&#x27; and drumming is an important part of summoning the ancestors. During times of celebration (e.g. at an initiation) the possessed sangoma is called to dance and celebrate their ancestors. The sangoma will fall into trance (when in trance a sangoma is not conscious of what is happening, and will require witnesses to repeat what had been said during the trance) where the ancestors will be channeled (which is signified in Zulu traditions by episodes of convulsive fits) followed by the singing of ancestral songs. These songs are echoed back to the ancestor via the audience in a process of call and response. The possessed sangoma will then change into their traditional ancestral clothing and dance vigorously while others drum and sing in celebration.

==History and background==

The Zulu word with prefix is &quot;isangoma&quot; (pl. &quot;izangoma&quot;), alternatively it is also spelled as &quot;umngoma&quot; (pl. &quot;abangoma&quot;), &quot;sa ngoma&quot; means &#x27;do &quot;ngoma&quot; and &quot;i sa ngoma&quot; means &quot;those who do &quot;ngoma&quot;&quot;, so &quot;sangoma&quot; or &quot;isangoma&quot; refers specifically to the practitioner of the &quot;ngoma&quot; practice. 

The term sangoma is often used colloquially in South Africa for equivalent professions in other Bantu cultures in Southern Africa. Forms of the &quot;ngoma&quot; ritual are practiced throughout southern and south-eastern Africa in countries such as South Africa, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho, Kenya, and Botswana. In more northern areas the practices are generally more diverse and less organised than the southern practices. Among the Kongo, the practice is called &quot;loka&quot; or more negatively &quot;doga&quot;, a term meaning witchcraft.

Ngoma is believed to have come to southern Africa during the western Bantu migration that began around 2000 BCE and was further influenced by the eastern Bantu migration that occurred until 500 CE. The practice has evolved along with the social problems of its users. In pre-colonial form ngoma songs dealt mainly with issues of hunting. Over time the system adapted to include the introduction of guns, and later the racial and class struggles of practitioners under colonial rule.

In Zimbabwe, the civil war experience led to a revival of ngoma practice with a new emphasis on the spirits of the victims of war. The service allowed the sangoma to help people cope with their own violent acts as well as those they had fallen victim to. An example of this is the Tsonga who believe that one of the main alien spirits that can bestow powers of clairvoyance and the ability to detect witchcraft is the Ndau Spirit. The Ndau spirit possesses the descendants of the Gaza soldiers who had slain the Ndau and taken their wives. Once the Ndau spirit has been converted from hostile to benevolent forces, the spirits bestow the powers of divination and healing on the n&#x27;angna.

Ngoma has been adapted by many to include both Christian and Muslim beliefs.

==Legal status==
Sangomas are legally recognised in South Africa as &quot;traditional health practitioners&quot;, under the &quot;Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2007 (Act. 22 of 2007)&quot; as diviners alongside herbalists, traditional birth attendants, and traditional surgeons. The act calls for the establishment of a national council of traditional health practitioners to regulate and register a.o. sangomas in the country. However, it was only in December 2011 that the National Department of Health took action and opened nominations for seats on an interim council. In October 2012, Health Department spokesperson Joe Maila advised that the department aimed to have the council up and running by the end of 2012. The Interim Traditional Health Practitioners Council was eventually inaugurated on 12 February 2013. Several sections of the act, dealing with the establishment and governance of the national council and the registration of practitioners, came into effect on 1 May 2014.

Previously, the South African Parliament had passed the &quot;Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2004 (Act. 35 of 2004)&quot;. However, the act was ruled unconstitutional after Doctors for Life International challenged it at the Constitutional Court, citing the insufficient public participation at provincial level in the drafting of the act.

The South African Law Reform Commission received a submission from the Traditional Healers Organisation requesting the investigation of the constitutionality of the Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957 and the Mpumalanga Witchcraft Suppression Bill of 2007, the drafting of which was suspended in 2008. On 23 March 2010 the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development approved a South African Law Reform Commission project to review witchcraft legislation. In March 2012 the South African Law Reform Commission advised that Ms Jennifer Joni has been designated as researcher and Judge Dennis Davis has been designated as project leader for Project 135: Review of witchcraft legislation. Dr Theodore Petrus, who completed a doctoral thesis on witchcraft-related crime in 2009, was invited to become part of an advisory committee to assist in the review.

==White sangomas==

While there are recorded instances of white sangomas before 1994, since 1994 an increasing number of white people have openly trained as sangomas in South Africa. The question of authenticity is still an ongoing discussion. According to Nokuzola Mndende of the Icamagu Institute, a Xhosa sangoma and former lecturer in religious studies at the University of Cape Town: Philip Kubekeli, director of the Traditional Medical Practitioners, Herbalist and Spiritual Healers Association, and Phephsile Maseko, spokesperson of the Traditional Healers Organisation, see nothing wrong with white sangomas. Kubekeli and Maseko maintain the position that traditional healing knows no colour.

Several white sangomas, interviewed by The Big Issue in 2010, claimed that they have been welcomed by the black community in South Africa, aside from isolated experiences of hostility. On the other hand, there have also been reports that white sangomas have been less readily accepted by black sangomas.

A number of South African traditions (e.g. Swazi and Tsonga/Shangaan) involve the belief that a foreign or alien spirit can call one to become a traditional healer, which they call a&quot;bandzawo&quot;, especially if there is a significant extreme relationship between one of the healer&#x27;s biological ancestors and the foreign spirit that occurred in the past. Dr Nhlavana Maseko, founder of the Traditional Healers Organisation, explains: 

==Relationship with bio-medical medicine==

The formal health sector has shown continued interest in the role of sangomas and the efficacy of their herbal remedies. Botanists and pharmaceutical scientists continue to study the ingredients of traditional medicines in use by sangomas. Well-known contributions to world medicine from South African herbal remedies include aloe, buchu and devil&#x27;s claw. Public health specialists are now enlisting sangomas in the fight, not only against the spread of HIV/AIDS, but also diarrhoea and pneumonia, which are major causes of death in rural areas, especially in children. 

In the past decade, the role of traditional healers has become important in fighting the impact of HIV and treating people infected with the virus before they advance to a point where they require (or can obtain) anti-retroviral drugs. However, there are no traditional medicines in South Africa that have clinically been proven to be effective in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Repeated use of the same razor blade to make incisions for muthi as well as wielding power over patients to sexually assault them, sometimes dressed up as ritual, carries HIV transmission risks. A conclusion from a review by UNAIDS in September 2000, regarding collaboration with traditional healers in HIV/AIDS prevention and care, found that modern and traditional belief systems are not incompatible, but complementary. 

Medical doctors have reported cases of patients with serious gastrointestinal problems through the use of muti, especially in enema form, and have coined the phrase &quot;ritual enema induced colitis&quot; to describe the phenomenon.

==Fraudulent sangomas and scam artists==

While many traditional healers positively contribute toward the healing process, the industry has been exploited for financial gain by charlatans who have not undergone training, sometimes called plastic shamans. Not all countries in southern Africa have effective regulatory bodies to prevent this practice. 

Scammers commonly advertise through flyers and posters plastered on lampposts in streets throughout South Africa, especially in densely populated urban areas. The advertisements claim the ability to bring back lost lovers, potions to enlarge penises and spells that will make people rich or provide them with luck. In the Cape province of South Africa, scammers may adopt Arabic-sounding names in order to attract the local Cape Coloured population, who are in part Muslim.

Significant amounts of money have been lost in these scams and women seeking abortions through these unregulated services have suffered damage to their reproductive organs, impacting their ability to conceive in the future.

Believing that fake healers harm the reputation of traditional healers, trained sangomas are looking to curb their negative impact through regulation, legal action and awareness. Many sangomas do not advertise through flyers or posters, tending to rely on word of mouth and the belief that their ancestors will send them the right clients.

Mary Bungeni, a sangoma herself, explains: 

Dr Motlalepula Matsabisa, director of the Medical Research Council&#x27;s Indigenous Knowledge Unit, says there appears to be many fake traditional healers around, however because of a lack of regulation, they go unchecked and explains that if anyone can bring about good luck and predict lotto numbers, they would not be poor themselves. However, he also warns that people should not be gullible.

Phephsile Maseko, national coordinator of the Traditional Healers Organization (THO), says:
